At first, it's kind of overwhelming, there is a lot of items( long item descriptions...) and shiny things on the screen. 
First thing to do would be main quest. There are several path you can take to to get too bored when remaking a character. 
Season servers help you grind faster to get to the endgame content and try several classes without spending weeks on the xp. You don't have to only grind, tho, because the game has a LOT to do. 

It's one of the main thing that got me to stay and play every weeks.
- You can explore, do local quests which have many types. 
- You can talk to ncp and get friendship with them with a mini game. This requires to talk to ncp anytime you encounter a new one. I believe it can unlock functions or items to buy/sales on their items but I never delve too much on this part because I don't really like the mini game. 
- You can do pretty much any type of life work you can imagine in an mmo. Fishing, cutting wood, grass, have a house(can furnish and craft furniture) and a garden. You can cook, do alchemy in a very complicated looking but very cool way.
-This also has a management side to it where you buy houses in cities, transform them into workshop. You then buy or make equipment to place there so they can go gather and craft items (some are workers only perhaps? im not an expert)
It's a bit long to learn or get into but very fun.
-There is a lot of quality of life stuff that are cool like autopathing to quest locations (you will still have to look for some stuff yourself and it is slower than running manually on a horse), stuff to do while autopathing (little mini games or reading)
-I never participate in community stuff but I enjoy doing lifeskills in my corner and the fact it's a one time buy is very advantageous for poor me.

It's practically one of the horsemen of the apocalypse In my book when it comes to setting a high-bar for the next generation of MMORPGs, Because of BDO's amazing graphics and Insane combat system its easily one of MY personal favorite games of all time. Yes it has its flaws but I learned trying out a lot of new MMORPGs
that they can't deliver the amount of things BDO had to offer me as a MMORPG. it was truly amazing for me the first day I logged in.

Customization is Good and the Classes are good, although gender locked. It still has a variety of choices for both sides. On top of a open world there's various different mounts and things to traverse the world so you don't seem like you're going to point A to point B in a trip of 20 minutes afk'ing auto-path'ing. 

Costumes and Glamouring Accessories ingame? 

The game has a lot of costumes inside it's game shop, But don't let that discourage you, there is alternative ways to get costumes from players who post them inside the in-game marketboard, You can place a order of the item you desire and it will be(although might take some time) it will be sold eventually to you. There's also seasonal rewards and events where they give away some sets of costumes. This is what I know so far from some players who have managed to secure a costume they wanted.

The storyline is Chaotic?

BDO definitely has its own lure and it's own world story developing around the creatures and lands you explore. I found myself doing storyline quest, simply because it gives me something to do alone when I'm done grinding or I'm just finding something to do in the game that isn't PVP. For some, The story hits, and for some the story is just ""there..."" In my though its got some scenes fully voice acted and animated compared to HOW BDO STARTED? i'll take this over the OLD-bdo story-telling. the renewing was from Bronze to golden quality in my opinion. 


Overall Experience: 

In 2024... I simply feel like there's nothing out there like this yet? but at the same time, relief the game is actually improving the way that it is since I started playing it. It simply makes it hard to quit a good game that doesn't lets new generation over-take their MMO,  Just like ESO and FFXIV and WoW, there's a game for everyone out there, and who knows if this one is just the game for you ?",1559782227,1708574185,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Be aware that this is a game where classes are Gender locked because ""S.E.X. sells"" and Pearl Abyss isn't changing that anytime soon. Currently there are 9 male classes and 18 female classes making it a 1:2 ratio.

Let's start from the top with just my thoughts from playing, and just recently I started to invest a lot of time in the game and take it seriously. This game is not a game that holds your hands like you'd expect from World of Warcraft, FFXIV, New World, etc. This is a game of trial and error, you *WILL* get confused, you *WILL* have to learn combos, you *WILL* have to invest a lot of hours before you're remotely ready for ""End-game"". You will be left to yourself to learn just about everything unless you ask the community on what you should and should not do. The tutorial is hardly a tutorial, it gives you the general idea of how ""some"" combat works. 

Starting out, you're going to be putting in some time choosing what class best suits you, and no two classes are alike (except for a few like Witch and Wizard, Kunoichi and Ninja, Musa and Maehwa, which you can expect those classes to have very similar performance.) After the creation of your character (which for new players I highly recommend playing as a Seasonal character and start catching up to early end-game. After the completion of your Seasonal character, then begins the endless grind. Do not expect a lot of group content, for the most part this is a single-person experience, however there are some group content like PvP, and some bosses. Don't expect the kind of experience you had from New World, WoW, FFXIV-- throw most of those expectations out the window.

In all realism, this game is for those who want a long-term experience, and players who got a niche for Mortal Kombat-esque games that got a dash of MMORPG elements to it.

Pros:
Great game to sink hours of game-time into
You're not frantically gearing up for Raid nights
No Mythic+ system
No dicey expansions
It's $10 when not on sale
The endgame experience is what YOU choose.

Cons:
Classes are Gender Locked.
It takes ages to get top tier armor
You're going to be FIENDIN' for some CRONS.
You may develop arthritis or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome for button smashing: SHIFT, W, E, F, X, C, Z, Q, A, S, D.
You'll slowly forget you have a family outside of BDO.
WHY AREN'T OUTFITS JUST FAMILY BOUND IF I CAN GET THAT OUTFIT ON ANOTHER CHARACTER?!?!?!?!?!?!

Honestly, I didn't think much of it at the time. Why would I? Who expects to lose their entire account just because they miss an email...

Fast forward to today, and guess what? I tried to log in, and boom - account's gone. Apparently, that transfer window was real, and I completely missed it. Now, I'm left wondering: Is it really too much to ask for companies to clearly communicate critical information and give players a reasonable timeframe to take action? Especially when we're talking about accounts potentially worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars?

This whole situation honestly feels like a slap in the face to loyal players like me. Black Desert, seriously, where's the concern for your customers? When is losing everything supposed to be our problem?

This review isn't just about my own frustration, but about raising awareness for others who might be in the same boat. Think twice before hitting that ""dismiss"" button on any important-sounding email from BDO, folks. And Black Desert, for the love of your player base, do better next time.  So when did it become a concern to bdo about making this important and do the auto transfer? when they only spent a few bucks or maybe couple hundred what about a couple $#@ thousand?   Oh I made purchases before steam and when  I connected bdo to steam .. Unfair Contractual Terms but hey dont matter they didnt xfer in time so we win and they will want to play again and spend more money.. run away trust me after seeing people having their account banned for pretending to  use a macro.. lol  or not paying attention to bdo e-mails .. yeah

would only recommend if you're in the market for braincell diarrhoea and a 2nd or 3rd job
--------------------------------
the scenery, some graphics, and environments look nice, characters and classes have cool abilities and great combat potential
but, most AI and monsters you face in the game have little to no variety, especially in their attacks, they just take hits and bonk you, with the only difficulty being in the health and damage differences between levels

even with the variety of skills your character could use for great combat against difficult enemies, it doesn't matter, because you can just spam any attack or AoE skill at a group of mindless mobs (nearly all the enemies in the game)

although the environments look nice from a distance, the level design is terrible, with either large empty spaces for the levels, or just big boxes lacking detail and a few with rocks or chairs
everything you encounter in the wilderness will either be a plain filled with mobs, a forest filled with mobs, a camp filled with mobs, or a cave filled with mobs, etc, with nothing else relevant to gameplay, environment, or level design to make it fun or interesting to explore and play.
when the environments and levels are somewhat well-developed, having some cool mechanics, like in some of the few dungeon areas, the MMO component ruins them with other players clearing the dungeons and completing puzzles either for you, or at the exact same time as you

PvP is unplayable in oceania, no servers, really aids latency

the soundtrack is okay, but each region just has a loop of the same repetitive tracks

the short storyline not only has terrible missions and writing, a repeat of 'interact with X npcs', 'kill Y mindless mobs in this area', it has stayed the exact same (with little to no new missions, lore, anything) for ages, and you usually have to replay the entire thing across all of your characters

isn't even too fun with friends, as the only thing you can really do together is try to manage the jank and complete ur story missions at the EXACT same time and order, or mindlessly kill mindless mobs together for quicker mindless grinding

at this point, the game is practically a walking, grinding, and lifeskilling sim to level up and drip out your characters and their fishing skills for literally no reason
--------------------------------
unless you're into watching paint dry and/or gathering water in a stream, exploring big empty open areas, watching someone automatically fish, or watching your character hit a rock/tree all day until you run out of stamina (which you need to grind or pay to increase) or something, this game is pretty fucking terrible, especially long-term

The entire game is a grinding simulator, some people like that but when it takes hundreds of hours to make minuscule progress it gets quite bleak. 

The game is very micro transaction heavy and does its utmost to make you buy things (honestly worse than most mobile games) and the enhancement system is obviously rigged. 

The fan boys will tell you intro level understanding of probability but anyone who has taken an actual class on it will know that items with a 56% chance of success simply do not fail 10+ times, plus they monetize the items around the enhancement system (in other words their incentive is to make you fail over and over again.) Assume the chance of enhancement is actually 30-50% of what the number says and you'll be less disappointed.

The costumes and classes are heavily swayed towards fanfare, with 18 female classes and 9 male classes expect everything to be focused on the sexualization of the female body (or weirdly in one classes case a female child's body.) This is more the fan bases fault as these virgin cucks will buy anything that shows skin but they still enable it.

Let's dive into the wild world of Black Desert, where you can ride on anything from horses to llamas and even camels. This game's got it all: PvP fights for the brave and life skills for those who prefer a more chill vibe. Personally, I'm all about those life skills—they keep me busy in the best way possible!

Graphics:
Picture this: you can tweak the graphics to fit your PC setup like a glove. Whether you're rocking a fancy rig or an old laptop from the prehistoric era, Black Desert adapts like magic. So, no matter your setup, you're in for a visually stunning ride!

Gameplay:
Black Desert serves up a double dose of fun with its PvP showdowns and laid-back life skills. From fishing to farming, there's never a dull moment. Sure, mastering everything takes time, but hey, it's all part of the adventure, right?

Microtransactions:
Now, let's talk cash. Some folks think Black Desert is pay-to-win, but that's just a myth. You can splurge on fashion for your character, but you can't buy your way to victory. The in-game store is more about convenience than giving you an unfair advantage.

Support and Community:
Need a hand? The game's support team is on it like a wizard with a spell book. They'll help you out, even if you've done something silly (we've all been there!). Plus, there are tons of YouTube videos and guides to help you on your journey. As someone who spends a lot of time at home, Black Desert has been a lifesaver, bringing me into a world full of adventure and friendship.

Conclusion:
In the land of Black Desert, where time flies faster than a magic carpet, I give this game a solid 10 out of 10! It's addictive, it's fun, and it's a whole new world waiting to be explored. So saddle up, friends, and let's ride into the sunset together!",1638022858,1707826515,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My experience with this game has been mostly positive, but there are definitely a lot of things the game still needs to improve. The new player experience is (still) very confusing and difficult to get through without any help. Hell, even just picking a class to start with is daunting bc the game does a crap job of explaining how each class works or feels to play. I highly recommend looking up class picking guides. Blue Squadron on YouTube has a whole ""choose your class"" series that helped me through that process.

Don't get me wrong. The game has a whole host of problems it needs to work on, most of them centering around the game being able to explain itself to the player without the aid of outside help. That said, this game is also a lot of fun. I find myself coming back once a year just to give it another fair shot bc I know it has potential. I fell off of this game a lot in the past, and I can't say for sure that I won't fall off again. But I still think the experience of playing this game was worth it regardless. The combo system if a combat system that you really don't see often / at all in other MMO titles, and BDO did a fantastic job implementing it in their game. Even on Succession Nova (frequently toted as the worst class to play in the game. Not to be confused with Awakening Nova, toted as one of / the best classes for pvp / pve.), I feel the power and complexity of the combat engine on a visceral level. Pulling off your class's combos feels compelling and powerful. In short, it just feels good to play the game.

Where the game falls short in this respect is the absurd amount of non-gameplay things you are basically forced to do in order to fully unlock the actual gameplay. For example, you essentially unlock a whole new and unique style of combat for you character once you awaken them, but you're also not able to test out your new abilities very much unless you stop following the main story line (typically because you're over-leveled and one-shotting every enemy rather than actually having to use your combos). And even then, shortly after awakening you discover a new quest line that everyone essentially has to do in order to unlock the game's fast-travel system. The sad part is that this quest line is substantially long and has little to no combat to speak of, meaning you end up feeling like you're doing your chores almost immediately after the game hands you a brand new toy that you would rather be playing with instead.

Man, reading this makes me feel like I should NOT recommend the game, but I promise it is worth playing. It requires you (the player) to put in a lot of work in order to enjoy it. But I guarantee that it's worth it. That said, if you aren't patient then you may just want to skip this one.",1707779205,1707779205,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Been putting in tons of hours, even in a Guild I like and love, however I quit again...Why?

They re-implemented Xigncode again.  Why?  No idea but idiocy on their part.  Uninstalled the game as soon as I could and guess what?  Xigncode is STILL in my PC just like how it was back in the day.

I had to manually uninstall it once again, for why in the world would an anti-cheat continue to linger on even after the game that it was implemented for is no longer in my 
 pc anymore?  

It scans your ENTIRE PC, going through all of your folders, data, info (remember that an Anti-cheat should NOT be doing this in the first place) and sends them to who knows where, and considering that this anti-cheat is made by a Chinese company with connections to the CCP, well, let's just say I'm not stupid, and I couldn't hit the uninstall fast enough.

Sad really, since I love BDO (my hours prove it!) but not enough for it to keep xigncode running around in my PC.  

GGs BDO, since this will be the last time I play the game either until they remove again, or I will have transitioned to another game that doesn't run xigncode.",1706769724,1707513993,False,84,6,0.848890602588653564,2,True,False,False

1) P2W; BDO's sales strategy is designed around making you purchase items or feel worse about playing without them.

2) Toxic community; after LoL, this is probably the most toxic community I have met in my 20 years of gaming. Most of the community has spent so much money on BDO that they will DO ANYTHING to justify their purchase. 

3) 15vs15 uncapped(gear score) Guild Vs Guild; the nail in the coffin and the end for me. Progression is everything in BDO; a difference of 30 in GS can swing the tides and the top payers are always ahead. What's the point of competing when there's no fair competition?

Bad things: P2W, worst questing in mmo, worst dungeon designs, worst boss designs, too many UIs, brain dead grinding, graphic pop ins, low render distance, and bad at explaining game mechanics(google everything). 

The combat CARRIES this game hard. Only reason why i'm still playing is because of friends. The game is P2W but you can still play without feeling the FOMO of not spending money to progress. There are a lot of inconvenience things to make it so you want to spend money. Minimum you will have to spend if you want t4 pets and a tent is about 500$ if you have the base game but with the conqueror edition you only have to spend about 150$. Endgame is the same as early and mid game, just brainless grinding but in different zones, so play at your own pace to not get burnt out. 

There are way better mmos out there for example WoW, and FFXIV. If you don't mind tab target combat then play those instead but if you prefer action combat then play BDO.",1705718165,1707025254,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If your controller disconnects you got 10 seconds else its gna quit the game and send you back to character select? dude WTF??

Also, once you start playing the game UI is a complex mess that barely ever explains itself. You got to pick the beginner story tree for some action, else the story is a solid hour of just talking to NPCs who keep overloading you with senseless info about the sacred baracks, the ancients, the anals of blahblah blah and you gotta just stick it out and walk around talking to these crummies. The fight animations are sick.

BDO still has the worst PvP I've ever seen in an MMO.  PvP just devolves in to getting your opponent stuck in a stun lock situation where they can't response.  You still can't tell where attacks are coming from 99% of the time.  THere are a lot of times I can see my character getting hit but I can't even tell where the attack is coming from.   When I can Its already to late.  You essentially have to come up with an infinite combo that exploits your classes protections and be using them.  Essentially,  you are punching the air to keep your protections up.  Your opponent is doing the same.  And its all about which character has a gap in their defense first.  

PvE has gotten better with the inclusion of season play.   You can get a decently geared character ready to farm for the things you need.  Leveling itself is not a grind anymore.  Even without being Power leveled you can get to level 60 pretty quick.  

But really,  there is no substance there.   You go to one area run pack to pack blowing them up collecting the loot until you get the thing you want.  Then you go to the next spot to farm different monsters which might as well just be reskined version of what you have already been killing.  The content itself is not challenging.  It basically devolves in to a yes or no where or not you can kill it.  Its all gear based.  You can certainly skill your way through some spots but the grind becomes so inefficient that it is not worth your time.  

This game really really needs instanced 5/10 man raid content.   Currently,  there are very few reasons in PvE to actually group.  You will spent 99% of your time solo.  Even when you find 'group' content it still feels like you are solo along with a bunch of other people who are soloing.  

Overall,  the PvP is shallow and the PvE is shallow.  Its basically all paced in such a way that you always 'have something you could do'  but its basically the same thing.  go here kills 100000 mobs until you collect 100 of something then go to another location and kill things to collect 100 of something.  Same mechanic everywhere.  

They say the game is 'sandbox'.  It doesn't feel sandbox.  It feels like a solo game with other people running around doing solo things. 


Original:
Worst PvP I have ever seen in a MMO.  There is so much Crowd Control (CC) and Area of Effect (AoE) going on that basically it just devolves in to spamming your AoE abilities...stupid thing is that nearly all abilities have some sort of CC effect attached to them.  The contra to this abilities gives you some sort of invulnerability.  

PvP is about trying to CC your opponent and avoid being CC'd at the same time.  

PvE is just there to support PvP.  If you don't want to PvP then there is no real reason to play this game...becaues PvP will come your way either way.  

The game isn't P2W...You can't pay any sum of money and come out ahead of other players.  The items on convenience items that be obtained in game.  It is either time spent or money spent...You are still going to have to grind levels and gear.  Which give you the same 'buffs' you can pay for in the shop.  

PvP is hand down the worst I've ever seen.  I regret buying this game.  

Its really only popular because of the fact that if you out gear people you win.  Skill isn't required.  

If its not the CC kicking your ass its the gear.  If its not those two things then its the prolific amount of RNG in the game.",1525672119,1706630582,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

This game is really hardcore playing oriented (and quite always ""solo surrounded by other players""). Everything is here hard to obtein : casual players, be prepared for pain. 

CashShop is expensive and can become a dangerous slot machine (ex : horsing resets for coursier : you buy tokens just ""to try again"" not ""to success""). 
Quests are ""not uninteresting"" but PVE is quite always grinding against packs of mobs. PVP promotes hardcore players in endgame/specific gears, can be practiced anywhere or on specific BG/wars.  Toxicity, free ganking (mostly in low level zones or against weak/AFK players), and no ""friendly playing"" anywhere resume global social environment (you'll be ignore, pushed to get away, or loop attacked/killed for no reason). 
Housing is nice, many events happen, crafting (trading/horsing/sailing) is really interesting and can be a 100% way to play this game. 
Seasons servers can offer now full PVE rules and good gear to help new players.

I played 5 years (+14k hours) and always came back to this game same if each time BDO makes me feel it was  created for masochists : few players succeed or reach endgame in few clics, for most others it take months... or never (76fails for a dream-horse or no PEN upgrade after 14kh/billions : what can justify a so random-unbalanced system ?).

i have spent thousands upon thousands of dollars in the shop 
i have poured blood sweat and tears into leveling 30 of my characters to 59 and above

In any other case i would gladly recommend this game to dozens of my friends but with the recent ban of Red Dragon (the korean streamer), whom not only played for 7 YEARS and streamed your game for thousands of viewers

in short; he put his headphones on his keyboard, got reported for using macros, was cleared of the accusations in an investigation BY pearl abyss, got unbanned, got BANNED AGAIN because the korean community just WANTED it; not even for breaking TOS

i cannot in good faith support pearl abyss's decision - it instills a fear in any long term bdo player that EVERYTHING can be taken away just because of petty witch hunting 

i will not waste my time on a game that would treat any consumer, let alone any conduit for new players, like that

it's been a good run but i will not be playing this game the way it's being handled; doesn't matter if it's on the korean servers or not

Game wise : 0 Content , Copy Paste content, Boring Content
PA removes PVP little by little as they want to do it a PVE game.
Beside grinding like a mad man and logging in to get free PEN gear and New players having better RNG (Confirmed by Dev's) the game has nothing to offer. The goal is to grind PVE to upgrade your PVE gear to grind better PVE spots,              - Nodewar's (They want to make it once per week)
-Arena of Solare (Classes are not balanced, Archer can shoot you out of render distance, Drakania deals  tons of dmg while being tanky, stupid metas)
-Red Battlefield (Worse type of PVP content)
-ArshaPVP (Dead Servers)

Dev's won't listen to Western complaints and only listen to KR community, so please STOP playing the game as it won't respect your time as a MMO player. No real goal as PVP content its dead (The main part of the game its the Unique Combat Style ) its just Sisyphus work .",1498563048,1705483574,False,0,0,0,3,True,False,False

If you have good graphic card, try remastered graphics and filmic filter and mess with some settings.

Everyone can have several small houses in towns, plus giant mansion (no need to compete with other players for a house). You may need to compete with players in certain towns if you wanna make special items.

There is pvp but it unlocks after u do a quest at 49 which u can skip if u just wanna do lifeskilling for example. 

This game is the perfect chill game if you enjoy lifeskilling by yourself and using workers you hire. You can focus on Lifeskilling from start and just do quests related to it if thats what u wanna do. Bartering sail on ship fight pirates and sea monsters while trading good over sea, trading (wagon+horses).

There is alot of work you wanna do afk, you can minimize the game or do something else in real life. No you can't afk train something and not be logged in.

There is party content but not much, you can grind with friends usually 2-3 in groups. Guild bosses recently got reworked and you can get hired to other guilds as a mercenary everyday. It is very good money and lots of people are doing it. Mechanics got made better as well.

There are only 4 dungeons in the game and more coming or a raid will be added soon.

PvP enjoyers say pvp is mostly dead, peoplle mostly just fight over grinding spots sometimes or do Nodewars.

Always start off by creating a season character, create a trial character lets you try out the character you are interested in and I highly recommend doing so because each character plays very differently. Most thing I enjoy about this game is all the combo moves but you can also use hotbar for skills if u dont wanna feel like your playing mortal combat.
Follow quests recommendet by black spirit and ingame seasonal guide. Join a guild to get help and power levels. Focus on one thing at a time cause there is alot of stuff to learn and tons of items with sheet long details.

Exiting season character has been made much much easier and better. You can now get T9 horse and tet black star weapon of your choice for free. They have been working alot on Quality of life updates and improving many aspects of the game as well adding new content. 

It takes time to get a new boat and although many people tell you sea content is dead it means mostly that it gets you less money than grinding in certain areas but don't get fooled it is amazing adventure and alot of fun if you enjoy that kind of stuff, like me.

You play alot solo compared to other mmos, although the chat in the game is done very well and you can chat with everyone across all of the servers using group chat to ask for help.
The game has alot of complicateted ways of doing things but the GMs in the game are amazing and are sometimes available in chat to ask. There are many guides and alot to learn and alot to grind, this is kinda like warframe where you kill groups of enemies for rare loot all the time.

Upgrading your weapons, horses, characters feels very special because it is difficult and takes alot of work and time.

Just playing alittle and logging in gets you tons of rewards so it wont be insanely hard to upgrade your main character to decent stats, you also need several characters to quickly login to other areas like worldbosses and if you just want a break from monster grinding and go do something else like sailing, lifeskilling, questing or just chilling.",1704512859,1705423178,True,21,1,0.700873434543609619,2,True,False,False

End game is only reached through heavy, HEAVY grinding but seems to be worth it. 

However, the possibilities in this game when it comes to life skilling is remarkable. Breeding horses and pets is something I've never touched before in an MMORPG in addition to your usual gathering, crafting, cooking etc etc.

Its not really p2w anymore either because even a whale would balk at the amount you would have to spend to make a dent.

Its a grind simulator. If you don't like hours of repetitive grinding this game is not for you. It's not for me either but sunk cost fallacy and all. It took me a few hundred hours of trying to realize it and now I feel like I've come too far to give up.

I don't like how they've monetized it. Also, the number of menus and submenus is ridiculous.

However, there is no tutoring for things like trade, nodes, buying a house (why?), etc. I never felt they were worth the research online to learn about them. One major negative for an MMORPG is that, though there are often too many people on the servers (which can cause mission start points to not spawn), there is no interaction with them. Other games of this genre allow random players to take down a boss together or even show acts of kindness by helping a lower level player overcome a swarm of monsters. 
Another negative for me is what I call the Asian sense of aesthetics. Games from Japan, Korea, and China all depict characters as adolescents: 16 year old girls and 19 year old boys. No matter how I tried when I created my character, I could not make him look older than his twenties.
The story line is barely there, which makes me lose interest in the game eventually. I play these games for their stories. That's what makes me feel engaged. One other very annoying thing is the little black spirit that accompanies one through the game. At least I have not met any stupid puzzles (yet).

582660,155506217,76561199066569676,0,25,304,0,304,1704657800,"This game seems interesting, but there are just too many issues. The camera is often in an awkward position when you log in, or during cutscenes. I thought something was wrong because the screen was all white when I logged in, but it turns out the camera was in my horse. Mounts are frustratingly slow until you realize that you have to spam shift to get them to get going. Otherwise they walk slower than your character. Getting a horse to stop is obnoxious and I often go past, or through, whatever I was trying to get to. It's tough to tell the difference between characters and NPCs, so I find that I have to slowly walk around reading all the many, many lines of tiny text above everyone's head to try to figure out who is an NPC, and that's made worse by everyone having their horses all over the place. During cutscenes, character models will shake rapidly, sometimes hover above the ground, and parts of NPC bodies are always going through other objects. It's like they spent a lot of time on the skins and very little time on the models and hit detection.

I don't really care for the combat in this game. In most MMOs, when you are really low level things will die in a hit or two. Not this game. You'll hit something over and over and over and the HP bar won't move. The same goes for enemy attacks. Normal enemies in the field can hit you over and over and you'll stay at full health. The result is that you spend a lot of time trying to kill all the enemies you need for a quest. Attacking is done through key combos, and combo attacks are done by stringing together multiple key combos in a row. It's exhausting. After unleashing everything I had on a single mob and still only getting it down to half health, I noticed I still needed to kill over a dozen more for the quest, which was going to take ages, so I just ran back to town and exited the game.

Interacting with NPCs is basically just spamming R to get through all the conversation, start and end quests, etc. Just keep pressing R until it doesn't do anything anymore. It can be difficult to tell which NPC you're going to talk to when approach them and hit R. Unlike other games where you select objects with the mouse, this game takes over the mouse, using it for moving the camera, and everything is done through the keyboard. I often find myself hitting R, realizing it was the wrong NPC, hit escape, move my character a little bit, try again, until I get the right one, which can be very hard to find if there are other players and their horses around.

Overall I don't really see myself playing this game much. It's a weird combination of needing to figure things out myself and tutorials that walk you through every single aspect of something, but sometimes well after you needed it. I had a pet for many levels before I got the tutorial telling me what they are for and how to use them. I guess I had been missing out on a lot of loot since I have no idea how to pick up loot (other than having a pet do it for you), or what mobs may have been dropping things.",1704659150,1704659150,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Classes:
You have 27 classes to choose from, each class has a unique combat style, and set of weapons. I think BDO does a fantastic job at combat, special effects, and visual effects related to combat. They more recently started putting out class trailers, the Shai trailer being the coolest IMO. I hope they start putting more effort into the Class trailers and wish they would revamp/create a trailer for each class.

Character Building and Customization:
One of the most engaging parts of BDO is the customization range of the classes. Whatever you can dream of or fantasize about your character looking like, you can create it! Or, if you're not creatively inclined you can choose from the thousands of templates created by other people. 

Questing:
PA Dev's have made many improvements to the quest lines in BDO. Instead of spamming R to get through them all, you are pulled into the story with cut scenes, some you are able to interact with, and many quest lines to adventure down in. They are expanding regions which offer more quest lines and a new range of quest lines, monster zones or grinding, or nodes to gather/excavate items. I am personally someone who enjoys lore, and BDO has very in depth and interesting lore. 

Combat:
While this is a PVP/PVE game, I more so enjoy PVE at this time in order to farm silver to improve my gear. The gear system in BDO for some may be a pain if you're an enhancer, but if you're a buyer there are many boss gears to choose from and very very very expensive ones if you're PVP focused.

Overall:
If you are looking for a time sink MMO game that you can play at your own pace and your own way, then I recommend Black Desert Online.",1704556363,1704556363,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I may write more in the future (possibly a guide), but here's my general findings after many years playing and interacting with the community.

[h2]Is this game for you?[/h2] If you like MMORPG gameplay, sandbox adventure/exploration, and like things such as questing, gathering, looting, crafting, player houses, fishing, farming, etc, and creating a unique character, then you will enjoy this game!

There's a little something for everyone in BDO... while it may not be as story heavy as some RPGMMOs such as guildwars, and may not have the typical raids etc some are used to in other games, what is there is enjoyable and there is a lot of room for carving your own adventure. 
The game continues to improve with each update, with the Mountain of Eternal Winter expansion bringing you not just a new character class and a whole new region packed full of adventure, but a rather likeable companion for the duration of the main quest arc brought to life by a famous voice actor. While the Land of Morning Light brings you a fairly authentic Korean Mythological experience, two new character classes, a whole new boss battle/conquest experience, and a veritable smorgasbord of delight for any life skill enthusiasts.

[h2]Value for money:[/h2] 10/10 at standard price, 11/10 when on sale.
On sale it's less than a pound at £0.89, AND... ALL THE GAME UPDATES AND EXPANSIONS ARE [b]100% FREE[/b]!

[h2]P2W?[/h2]
[b]Just NO[/b]... there is a cash shop, but buying items from it does not enable you to win, they're mostly cosmetic, and slightly quality of life at best. Meanwhile the BDO team has actually limited the rate at which you can sell things like outfits on the in game market for in game currency.
The reality is it would take you hundreds-thousands of IRL currency and literal years to make the same amount of money you could make in a week or two worth of grinding/actually playing the game.
Only noobs who have taken one look in the pearl shop and not understood what they are looking at say it's P2W, but never do any research to back up their assumption. *rolls eyes*

[h2]Loot:[/h2] 10/10 Daily log-ins, events, free codes, quests, drops, watching twitch streams, season, holiday events, random gifts from the devs, etc, shower you with all kinds of loot including items/pets/outfits/mounts/furniture... all worth IRL money in the cash shop.

[h2]Life Span:[/h2] Black Desert has been ""Online"" from around 2014 which makes it nearly a decade old now, and since then the game has continued to be updated, expanded, improved. 
2019 saw the launch of the game on the popular console platforms, and recently the game's player base has grown such that the BDO team have significantly expanded the number of available game world servers... it's safe to say the game will be here the next time you log in which isn't always the case for many MMOs.

[h2]Graphics:[/h2] 9.5/10 for the remastered and ultra settings.
Anything from a Nvidia 980Ti upwards can expect pretty pretty graphics. It even has up-scaling for lower powered systems, or energy bill savings.
The truly [i]frugal[/i] can take further advantage of the ""Lowest/optimal"" graphics option for AFK game elements such as horse training or fishing and this can be combined with the power-savings gained by ""minimising to tray"", where the game goes into an already super optimised power-saving mode.
On an additional note: It's also nice that the game runs fine and doesn't fry your expensive graphics card, which you'd expect to be a given... [b]I'm looking at you New World[/b].

[h2]UI:[/h2] 3/10 when you first use the game. 9/10 once you set everything up yourself.
Why? Because when you first jump into the game world you will be hit with a poo-nami of hurty hurty ""[i]Oww [b]my eyes[/b], the pain, why won't it stop![/i]"" popup notifications about literally everything happening in the game including what your neighbour just did in the bathroom... [b]Fear not[/b] my friend, with a few minutes spent in the options menu you can easily turn off all the annoying notifications, reduce all the clutter, and can even fully customise most of your UI which is pretty neat.

[h2]Character Customisation:[/h2] 9/10. For an MMORPG it's fair to say this has one of the most comprehensive and in-depth character creators out there offering a wide range of customisation.
Pre-made templates are available for those with the artistic prowess of a house brick.

[h2]Class Selection:[/h2] 8.5/10 The class selection over all is pretty diverse. There are a range of male and female characters, many of which play quite differently to the rest, and they are interesting enough to make you want to try out most of them. It's worth exploring the full range to discover your favourites.

[h2]Combat:[/h2] 9/10 As far as RPGMMOs go, the combat is actually pretty damn good. I give it a 9 because there is room for improvement, but it feels more enjoyable than [strike]Lost[/strike] [i]Thurst[/i] Ark, and makes the control style of other games like Guildwars 2 etc feel rather dated/clunky.
Many who start and quit before giving it a real go might assume the combat is just a case of clicking the left mouse button to make monsters disappear... these people would be highly mistaken, and some of those would be irredeemable halfwits (but that's another story).
Combat tends to show its true colours by level 61 when you have unlocked all your skills, chosen the Awakening or Succession path, unlocked your Awakening weapon, and equipped suitable skill add-ons.

Farming drops will often be a one skill and rush on process which is the efficiency you want for this kind of task, but higher monsters and boss monsters will require thought, technique, understanding of your skills, setting your skills up properly for your class, and even learning some skill combos.
You can really go down the rabbit hole and learn more complex combos, part casts, skill cancellations, and even immunity frames if you crave the hand executed ""Uber Macro"" times of bygone days, it also plays a big role in PvP if you like PvP.

[h2]Community:[/h2] 8/10 There's actually a pretty good community surrounding BDO... every game has its curmudgeons, salty behotches, and toxy the toxic avengers, but providing you don't stand afk or fish outside of a safe zone, you'll likely not get greifed by a [i]kill happy[/i] pre-teen. Plus if you look around on discord, you'll be able to find a guild that speaks your native language. There are even communities for specific character classes and life skills like horse training/breeding, all of which can be an absolute goldmine of useful information... so have a look.

[h2]Final thoughts...[/h2] You can't decide if you truly like the game until you've completed a season character play-through, reached level 61 and started to actually get into the main game content. The same can be said for trying just one class, try a few over time, and don't get over-saturated by the game. If you're getting tired, take a break, it's not going anywhere, and a new update has taken the time constraints of season away, so you can play season at your own pace...
""[i]feels smooth like silka[/i]"".
You'll enjoy the holiday events... there's usually some daft fun or little quests to do around Easter, Summer, Halloween, Autumn, Thanks Giving, Christmas, New Year, Eastern New Year, etc, and the game world generally has an excitable bustle to it due to everyone logged in around these times.
There are live streams, and events held by the BDO team which may or may not be of interest. Some are good, others can be dull/cringe, it entirely depends on what you like.
They even hold music events/contests where people compose music in game with the available instruments and play mini concerts... daft but cute fun and you may even witness some true talent.

The character creator is so mind bogglingly terrible that I can't even get myself to the point where I'm actually playing the game. Each class has a set gender and body type, within which you have many sliders you can move that all have a narrow range that will basically make all characters of any class look more or less the same. The multitude of sliders tries to trick you into thinking you have a meaningful measure of control over your character's appearance. Alas, this just results in having many many sliders you must manipulate to try and see if you can make, for example, a more fem looking Sage (a class only allowed to be a man with a hulking jawline) but you will fail because whoever made this has decreed that all characters must either look like a cookie cutter supermodel with bouncing boobs and a developer mandated thigh gap or a dehydrated gym bro.

Character appearance is very important to me and I hate having my character look like a person who fits beauty standards so perfectly that it would be physically impossible for them to exist. If you're a girl character your boob armor will boing-oing-oing even though your bikini is made of metal. This whole thing reeks of gender.

The biggest problem is they hate male characters and cater only to the heterosexual male player-base.  Male characters/classes are skipped over time and time again in favor of instead adding in yet another female only class that they can sell slutty armor for in the cash shop.  Male characters get screwed in options for character design and cosmetics constantly.  Basically unless you want to play a Barbie doll character that dresses like the trashiest hooker you can imagine, you don't be happy with the look of your character.  Want sexy slutty armor for the few male classes that exist?  Too bad.. aside from the very few and poorly done options they threw in just to say they had 'something' ..there are no good options.  The male characters need to be covered up in full armor while the females run almost naked through the battlefield.  It's complete BS.

Majority of graphics
Holiday music was top notch

Season characters

Things that could be better:
Gender locked characters
Some objectives are confusing or hard to understand interactions
Only one Season character
Too many classes that are similar to other classes
Inventory issues (I honestly feel like this is created by the game be overly generous with rewards)


I enjoy parts of this game, but it is hard to feel connected to my character. I want to try other classes, but I can only have one Season character. To be fair, I am still fairly new to this game. I think Black Desert is decent, but there are better MMOs out there and more launching soon. I think buying the base game for .99 was a bargain, but I don't see myself playing this seriously for any length of time.

I have played many of the AAA titles like World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, ESO, New World, GW2 and many others like Rift, Tera, GTA V, even ArcheAge Unchained, just to list a few titles of the many I have played over the years. 

I enjoyed all of those other games for both the PVE and PVP experiences they offer. But there is something that I cannot seem to grasp with BDO. I played it when it first came out and you had to grind all day, bringing me back to my old school days of Runescape and Thang Online for some of the other old farts that may remember that old game. 

BDO is praised by so many for the combat, which ironically is the part that I cannot find enjoyment in. I'm sure many call me crazy for saying that, which is fine. To me, it feel like skills casting animations are problematic, at least for my style and expectation with action combat. I am of the belief that if the game promotes itself as a fast paced action combat system, then skills need to fall into line. 

Games like GW2, which is what I would argue is a hybrid of tab target with a small touch of action, still makes skills feel great, even World of Warcraft makes skills feel fluid and responsive. ESO is fine, not my top pick out of all the great combat systems out there, but still feels way more intuitive. Or take Monster Hunter, that combat system would feel amazing in BDO. I am not against a complex rotations or even simple combat systems. A good example of a very simple straight forward combat system is offered in New World, and it is one of the best feeling combat systems I have found to date for archery builds.

Graphics on the other hand are still top notch for the age of the game. I know that my issue with the game resonates with a small group of people, so if you are still wondering if you should try BDD, the short answer is, yes you should see if you find enjoyment.

There's no way back to the main menu to change your settings like volume. Once you've entered the server selection, you're locked in buddy.

Character creation is extremely clunky, with a hard to maneuver camera, not to mention the fact that the character constantly looks at the camera when you want to view other angles.

Sure, you can fully sculpt the face, there's no denying there's loads of creativity to be had there, but I simply cannot overlook the rest of the issues when it comes to the UI upon entering the game.

I don't feel the necessity to talk about the gender locked classes and the whole debacle about each of them, largely because I haven't played any of them at the time of writing.

As far as I can decipher, this game is more of a hero beat 'em up, akin to the likes of Warframe.

However, I cannot recommend this game with good consciousness while the UI is as clunky as it is.

You are playing a menu clicking simulator for about 5 hours.
You then realize you get 10x the exp/currency clicking thru menus for quests then actually playing the game....
WAY to many systems stacks on systems.
Extreme amounts of inventory bloat.
Graphics are great. But a tremendous amount of pop in/out graphics, lots of times your standing in the right spot just waiting for a NPC to spawn.

Combat and classes are amazing. But again very unclear and confusing for new players. 
I know my hours dont reflect... I played for a few hundred outside of steam.

Endgame is just about currency... farm for days/weeks/months generating currency. to RNG click for upgrades. or buy better gear flat out... to then be slightly better at grinding more currency. Rinse Repeat... Bosses are fun... the first time... although sorta glitchy... but again clearing harder difficulties comes down to the cycle mentioned above... 

Combo system for characters is great... but very poorly explained... game has too many buttons and to few buttons at the same time.

If you have played hundreds of hours before you know what to expect... if you have never played... pass this one over... Game does not respect your time at all... you have to invest hundreds of hours for very small gains or actual losses some times...

Boat, Sailing and Bartering have been updated, now pays more and has more features and less work to struggle, appreciated. All other things have been updated with more features and less struggle, not just sailing quests. I can say that now i can actually have fun in the game in less time plus also with no upsets during gameplay. Still... Magnus has a bug the game freezes when you try to teleport somewhere, is not always, but most of the time in a 2nd or 3rd time to teleport and for the boat, sometimes it gets stuck in the air without letting me get out from it, which i have to exit to the main menu and get back again, store the boat and take it out again, hoping my character doesn't get stuck again with the boat in the air.
Everything else is now working perfectly.

JUN 2023
Getting a Carrack is a bit easier now, but now i get only refresh 2 times when it comes to material search, even still having my refresh points for a next refresh, what is that? fix it. When it comes to boats, parts and Crow Coins, omg worthless, you buy something with Crow Coins that cost 1600 and if your selling it, the sale price is 10 Crow Coins haaaaa, they should remove that sell button, it is so worthless, with so much hard time to get your pieces, selling them is not an option, they should remove that button, i mean, if there weren't like time limits to get your barterings(materials and others), that you could just do it anytime that you want and how many times that you want, then ok, fine, but with limits and selling a material as such low price? nah, like a said, the button selling should be removed, it is worthless.

DEC 2022 UPDATE

It comes to me that BDO looks great, but, but, the mechanics upgrading are terrible, its a hustle, the amount of items in a daily quest are poor, even pro players have been playing more than a year or 2 to get things upgraded or done, the amount of  time to waste in this game upgrading and getting materials is ridiculous, upgrading for 1 carrack has been a pain in you know where, im beginning to look for other games,  i dont have  time for this, if you guys want to spend 1, 2 years to get your things on the game,  go ahead, BDO is right for you, if you don't have  much time to dedicate to a game, then this game is not for you.


NOV 2022 UPDATE
Game is super, but everything is so hard to do and takes so much time for anything to get done, specially working with ship upgrades, we are gamers, but we also have a life which is more important than spending 1,2,3 hours for some bartering for materials, plus some materials 1 per day, no sense to hold a player to doing what they need in a game to get their things done, sorry, can't waste so much time in games like these when there are other games much easier, less time to do things, that doesn't hold the player day by day, i can't, just can't, like i said, we are gamers, but we also have a life to attend which is more important. Give it a try guys, game is actually good, but it will consume your day and night believe me.


The game is great, only problem is that everything in the pearl shop is too expensive, i mean, look at the ship skins for sailboats and frigates, almost $50? too much for a skin, even if it has effects, the effects are not that good either for $50 dollars, you can buy a new game with $10 additional dollars making $60, pearl shop is too expensive, probably thats why we don't see so many ships with those skins, even so, after upgrading a ship to Carrack o Caravel Advanced, the skin becomes useless, waste of money in something that eventually will be lost when you upgrade to higher ships. Thats a no no, probably thats why they haven't done anymore skins for ships, because is not getting sold, not because the look or the effects, the price. Pearl shop has to be balanced, with $50, now days in any given situation where steam, microsoft, epic or any other gaming company that sells game, you may find a day 1, 2 o more games in special price for $50 and probably less like we have seen, i love the game, but if pearl shop is going to be like this always, i won't be buying anything from the pearl shop anymore. Forgot to mention that to upgrade anything here is such a pain at a point that you just feel like you want to stop playing the game, such pain.",1533611365,1703204801,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The quality of this game has changed very much. I would no longer recommend it. The development direction of the game has gone to cater to casuals and those who don't have time to play. And while that sounds great the application is pretty bad. Essentially they increased silver gain so much with the idea of making end game grind more rewarding. Instead it just created inflation (obviously)

Additionally all of the items that used to be true accomplishments like treasures and higher gear are now given away for free through in game events with minimal effort. Most of the rare items are no longer rare or untradable. Infinite potions can be traded and obtained thru daily quests now. Many treasures that had value and took a great deal of effort are now obtainable with mindless minimal efforts. 

Some people enjoy these changes. And if you are one of them power to you. If you are like me though, and like real sense of accomplishment for achievements including rare items and gear progression this game is no longer of interest. Its been a great ride black desert. Thanks for the memories. 

Overall rating now: 4/10

Pros:

- immersive 
- large world
- complex and deep systems
- regular updates
- recent updates have made lifeskilling and trades much more profitable and this game is now a good option for those who are less interested in combat
- great time sink if you have too much free time
- most paid items can be bought for in game currency however it can take extremely long time to get one on pre order. Sometimes weeks sometimes months. 

Cons:

- no real sense of accomplishment
- too many freebies and give aways
- gender locked classes with not enough male options (at time of writing the past 5 classes over 4 years have all been female, which is nice to look at and the classes are good just inconsistent)
- to play comfortably and not spend hours managing items and storage subscriptions are a must, and to have an optimal experience a few hundred dollars in purchases+ subscription is required
- class balancing doesn't happen frequently enough so older classes often fall behind in power and clear speed. While every class is playable and relevant for most or all content there are clear advantages to choosing newer classes. This is not unlike other mmos though. And is fairly standard in the genre. New content takes time to balance with old content. 
- open world pvp can now be completely circumvented. This was one of the major things that made black desert appealing to being with was that you could open world pvp anyone anywhere, while this is still possible private worlds can now be used to prevent pvp encounters and fighting over grind spots.",1689407749,1703187731,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game's mechanics seem to be in a constant state of disarray. Combat feels unresponsive sometimes, and the lack of polish is evident in various aspects of gameplay. It's sad to see a game with so much potential fail to deliver on basic mechanics.

Black Desert also has an excessively grindy progression system. While some grind is expected in MMOs, the level of repetition required in this game is excessive. It feels more like a chore than an enjoyable gaming experience. I shouldn't have to spend hours everyday grinding for a little bit of a gear boost.

The UI and overall user experience are awful. Navigating menus is a cumbersome task, and basic functions like editing the UI is locked behind leveling up.

The game's performance is awful, even on mid to high-end systems. Frame rate drops and inconsistent graphics make it clear that the game lacks proper optimization, impacting the overall gameplay.

In conclusion, Black Desert falls short of expectations due to its numerous bugs, broken mechanics, excessive grind, lack of player-friendly features, and poor optimization.

Embarking on a six-year journey with Black Desert has been a rollercoaster of highs and lows, with countless hours invested and numerous characters explored. Through the ups and downs, one thing remains certain – the time spent was far from regrettable and I always come back to this game.


Black Desert's unique blend of repetitive tasks has a strange allure that captivates players, myself included. The joy derived from battling monsters, even in a seemingly monotonous loop, is hard to put into words. The game allows you to switch off mentally, creating a space where you can unwind while engaging in enjoyable activities. Whether it's grinding mobs or enhancing gear, the gameplay loop somehow manages to stay entertaining.


Having witnessed the game's evolution over six years, it's apparent that Black Desert has come a long way. Recent changes have significantly improved the overall quality of life for players, catering to both returning and new enthusiasts. These adjustments not only streamlined the experience but also added layers of enjoyment for current players. The developers' commitment to enhancing the player experience deserves recognition.


An unavoidable aspect of Black Desert that divides the player base is the notorious RNG, particularly within the enchantment system. However, on a personal note, the RNG gods have smiled upon me. While some may complain about its unpredictability, I find the enchantment system adds an extra layer of excitement and unpredictability to the game.


One of Black Desert's standout features is its diverse range of systems, creating an experience akin to playing multiple games within one. Whether it's trading, fishing, or engaging in player-versus-player content, there's always something for everyone. This versatility keeps the game feeling fresh and ensures players can find aspects they genuinely enjoy.


Despite the game's strengths, a noticeable flaw lies in its optimization. Even on a high-end system, Black Desert struggles to maintain consistent frame rates, often succumbing to stutters and other performance issues. Addressing this optimization challenge should be a top priority for the developers, as it currently detracts from an otherwise immersive experience.


Six years into the Black Desert universe, and the journey continues to be a fulfilling one. The game's ability to evolve, provide diverse activities, and maintain an engaging experience is commendable. While RNG may be a contentious issue, the overall enjoyment derived from the enchantment system and varied gameplay systems overshadows these concerns. However, the plea for improved optimization remains, as it stands as a notable blemish on an otherwise outstanding gaming experience.",1703070327,1703070327,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I’ll try and keep this review short and concise, the game is great fun if you’re a new player, you get given lots of items to start off with and the game does a great job of explaining many of the mechanics to you through side quests, tutorial and the story. The game has a vast open-world and while its not as big as other MMORPGs its way denser with content and feels alive. There are also lots of things to do if you do not want to just grind by killing monsters, you can always just life skill and have a profession. The main issue I have with this game as I played it from the release before Steam till now is that gear progression is expensive and heavily luck dependant. This is because the change to get a successful enchantment can go from 20% all the way down to 3% last time I checked and every time you fail you must increase the durability using memory fragments. Another big issue is grinding in the game efficiently, its essential to have a costume and at least 3 pets to automatically pick up loot for you. This along with gear progression takes a lot time and is expensive.

Pros:
- Beautiful Graphics.
- Vast areas to explore and travel 
- Fluid Combat.
- Unique classes
- In-depth character creation

Cons:
- Grinding efficiently requires a costume, at least 3 pets with decent enchantments
- Not enough PVE endgame content aside from World Bosses
- Very grindy (although expected since this is a Korean MMORPG)
- Gear progression through enchanting is very expensive and luck dependant.
- There are notifications that you cannot turn off in the settings

In short, this game in its current state is great if you want to have some fun, but if you ever want to catch up and be competitive in PVP/PVE your going to have to spend at least £70 on the game.",1585575816,1702823862,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

The game itself has so much potential but it is all lost on things being way too complicated. The upgrade system is relentless and while they have tried to make up for people getting tired of the game with countless free rewards it only makes your effort thus far pointless. While this is not the most toxic game I have played it is definitely not known for being friendly. It is extremely unfriendly to new players and any player you try to invite gets tired of me having to explain so many things. A game should just fall into place after a while of playing it but this game never does. Too many things to learn/do too many risks to level up/upgrade. The season character system made it better but like I said for people who worked really hard for their gear it is now discouraging for people to just get similar gear after just a day or two of farming. There was so much potential but not enough guidance and it just kind of falls off. The questing is atrocious. But you have to do quests. It will give you a migraine trying to figure them out at times unless you've done them before and know where to go.

The combat are great kinda like Street Fighter but with 3D perspective (I talk about combos or sequential of attacking, pulling, kiting, dodging, moving, buffing, debuffing etc). 
The world and character is so beautiful (but gender lock).
Many thing to do aside from killing millions of same species of monster to progress your gear.
You can also killing another millions of same species to grind treasure items(Infinite Pots, Merchant Ring, Compass, Maps, Telescope etc) or something like Lifeskilling, train your loli to play instrument, getting bigger ship.

BUT 

If you appreciate your time. Don't! You must be ready to wasting your precious time and coping with losing resources. You can lose your sweaty grind progress by keep gambling on enhancing equipment and If you died while grinding, it might end up with crystal lose which usually cost 30 mins - 2 hrs of your efficient grind (This might big turnoff for new player) 

Too many different items with different categories that fills your inventory that are either useless forever, useless for you now or only useful when its event and with you are having a limited storage (Can increase it by P2W or keep playing the game) and your slaves put the their works too into the same storage, it is so messy. I'm remind you, don't trying to sort it, you better play any storage simulator games. It is make Minecraft sorting like a child play.

The Progress system is one of the worst.
It is like,
your checkpoint for each progression 8-12-15-30-55-7000-125000
your silver gain per progression 6-7-8-8-9-10-15
and you are either spend 70 hours to just progress single things or you can gambling to 50/50 of either go to moon or hours of your life taken.

Talk about gamble,
This is one of the core of the game, the games encourage you to do this or the system is based on this.
The game is full with [according to a set of probability] and 
events with 
1) chances to drop something.
2) chances for something to appear.
3) chances to get a box that comes with a probability to get something.
3) chances to drop a materials that are a part to craft something that needed to do a chances of something.

I already touch about chances of enhancing and I don't want to talk about chances to drop something while grinding.
Basically, if you have no luck, this game isn't for you. You are just hurting yourself.


Lets talk about P2W,
First of all, you need 
1) Campsite (You will hate grinding without this)
2) Horse Trumpet for horse calling (You will hate moving around the world without this)
3) Pets (You can get 1b/hr in some spots but you got 500m only? you think you suck but you stop to loot because your pet suck)
For point 3, middle finger to people said ""You can get pets just by playing, I play this game and all of my pet already max without spending a cent"". Tell to them, how long does its take? how many events? How lucky they are?. 5 pets without all at least Tier 3 is still bad and I'm sure all mission that you do won't give you this. You need to at least play 3-4 Event that hopefully have a reward provides a chances to get a pet and of course be lucky to get it.
4) Maids and Weight (Both are annoying if you just start the game, but not too significant as points above)
5) Value Pack (Think this like a subscription, but you won't feel it till reaching mid-game, you know how bad storage system? without this, even worst)

You might doing something wrong that will lose you a billions of silvers or getting a wrong progressing gear or wrong class to play but if you already started to play and enjoy it currently. Treasure it. The core of the game is about grind grind grind and gamble and there is also another way to enjoy it. just trying to motivate yourself to grind and reach your goals or sometime take a break and playing casually. 

VETERANS WILL SAY THIS MANY TIMES, THIS GAME IS A MMORPG, THIS IS MARATHON NOT A 100M RUN.
your 10 billions of lose is a laughingstock for a veteran with 500 billions of lose.

Update after another 7.2k hours:

Depression remains. this game still sucks. Come suffer with us. It's not joever yet.

Also hi Lauio I know you're reading this

After aditional 20kHours here's my final take:
A Masterpiece of Frustration - Black Desert Online

Oh, where do I begin with the enchanting experience that is Black Desert Online? It's truly a game that leaves you speechless, and not always in a good way.

Firstly, let me commend the developers for their dedication to creating a visually stunning world. The graphics are so breathtaking that you might find yourself forgetting about the numerous other aspects of the game that fall short. It's almost as if they wanted to distract you from the fact that the gameplay is about as smooth as sandpaper.

The enchanting mechanics are a real treat, providing a rollercoaster of emotions. One moment, you're on cloud nine after successfully enhancing your gear; the next, you're left wondering if the RNG gods have forsaken you. It's like a casino, but instead of winning money, you gain the privilege of not smashing your keyboard in frustration.

And let's not forget the joy of navigating the game's user interface – a labyrinthine masterpiece of confusion. It's like the developers decided to make a game within a game, challenging players to decipher the mysteries of the inventory system while juggling a circus of poorly explained features.

The PvE content is equally riveting. The grind is so exhilarating that you might find yourself questioning the very meaning of progress. Who needs a sense of accomplishment when you can mindlessly slaughter hordes of generic enemies for hours on end?

But fear not, as the game's community is there to lift your spirits. You'll be welcomed with open arms by players who are more than happy to share their wisdom about the ins and outs of the game. Just kidding – expect a toxic cesspool of elitism and condescension that rivals the depth of the game's lore.

In conclusion, Black Desert Online is a one-of-a-kind experience that will leave you wondering if you've accidentally stumbled into a parallel universe where game design conventions are mere suggestions. Bravo to the developers for crafting a game that truly tests your patience, resilience, and ability to resist the urge to uninstall. It's an experience you won't soon forget, whether you want to or not.

Worst part is, it could be fun if it wasnt so fucking boring. FML - when this POS is the best game I can find that I havent played. YOU WILL HAVE TO WATCH FUCKING YT VIDEOS TO FIGURE OUT MOST OF IT - the assholes cant even properly teach you how to play the fucking game. DO NOT TRY AND FIGURE THINGS OUT YOURSELF, IT FUCKING SUCKS. And dont bother with most ""guides"", as they assume so much knowledge of the game that reading them makes no sense at all. So, you have to already know the game to learn the game. 

Oh, I nearly forgot to mention the FUCKING GOD DAMN GRINDING you have to do to level up too. 

Play EVERYTHING ELSE ON YOUR LIST, then when you are REALLY BORED, try BDO.

*******************************************************************************
I cannot EVER see myself giving this a positive review, even if it ended up being the best game ever, the first 92 hours (at time of writing) has been such a nightmare to get anywhere and figure out all of the crap Ive tried to engage with. If someone from Pearl Abyss showed up and personally blew me, I would still not give it a positive review.  If you see my play hours getting into the hundreds or thousands of hours I still would not recommend this game.
*******************************************************************************

The game forces you to speed run the story just to get enough inventory space to make it playable, or spend real $. 

I CANNOT UNDERSTATE HOW MUCH THIS GAME WILL MAKE YOU DESPISE IT. 

I hate this game soooo much, but its the best of the fucking awful POS MMOs out there, and it looks like it could be fun if it actually did a good job of teaching players how to play all of the damn mechanics. Instead it just throws all of its shit at you all at once, and simultaneously explains NONE OF IT, unless you happen upon the right quests by chance, or arent in the middle of combat when it decides to pop up a guide on how to do some stupid shit.

Also, be prepared for SO MUCH FUCKING BORING TRAVELLING. I HAVE LITERALLY SPENT THE LAST DAY (!!!!!) JUST TRAVELLING, Trying to work out trade, nodes, upgrading strength. You will waste so many expensive items and resources - eg. XP INCREASE SCROLL THAT LASTED 1 HOUR was a complete waste because I didnt get to kill anything all fucking day. FUCK THIS GAME. You will have items in your inventory that will expire, and the game will not warn you before you collect the item, or if it does its in such a TINY FUCKING FONT THAT IS UNREADABLE EVEN ON A 27"" 1440p monitor. And they choose colours that make it even fucking harder to read. Oh, and no setting to change it.

The hours played is a COMPLETE LIE. The game encourages AFK ""play"", and wants you to leave it running as often as possible. Farming, fishing, travelling, processing, etc, all requires so much time you will be regularly WALKING AWAY FROM THE Console/PC while it just sits there.

I literally sit looking out the window waiting for this fucking POS, and when my character gets somewhere (like now) I just CBF'd doing anything except Im so fucking bored.",1700124372,1702015158,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

However, during these past two years the developers have been going in directions that are ruining the reasons why I love this game.  The lore is amazing, but the story is poorly written and implemented.  The combat is amazing, but once you get through mid-game level and gear, you hit an end-game wall take takes years to slowly overcome.  Excitement can quickly fade.  End-game rush mechanics are permanently in place, and you can get to the end-game wall in very little time.  Immersion is secondary to grinding as rushing to end-game.  The community is fractured due to the nature of the game being hyper-competitive, and the developers trying to heal the breach by not fixing the essential competitiveness by creating good cooperative mechanics.  They take it out on the PvP community and are forcing them into clunky, poorly designed, inorganic PvP modes.  The free, open world of this game is under assault, and players are forced to play the way the devs want them to, instead of being free to play as they wanted to, as they have been able to do for years.  Decisions made by developers are arbitrary and ppor planned, poorly implemented and trust down our throats, and if a change is unpopular, it's almost never addressed.  The beautiful soundtrack of this game was ruined two years ago, and is now a poorly implemented mess, with music playing in areas and situations that are incongruous.  Immersion is ruined by the music half the time.  In conclusion, this game is ok for players wanting to dabble in it for a few months, but once you hit the end-game wall, unless there's some reason to stay, like knowing how great this game used to be, and the hope that it can be returned to it's glory, there is little to look forward to aside from years of grinding for little purpose.

Review:

""Black Desert"" stands as a testament to the sheer grandeur and immersive quality that an MMORPG can offer. My journey in this expansive world has been nothing short of extraordinary, and the joy of playing alongside friends has elevated the experience to new heights.

Visually, ""Black Desert"" is a masterpiece. The attention to detail in character design, landscapes, and the overall environment is breathtaking. The seamless transitions between day and night, weather changes, and the dynamic world events contribute to a living, breathing virtual realm that feels truly alive. Whether delving into dungeons, engaging in epic battles, or simply exploring the vast open world, every moment is a visual feast.

The character customization in ""Black Desert"" is unparalleled. The level of detail you can achieve in sculpting your character's appearance is astonishing, allowing for a level of personalization that is rarely seen in other games. It adds a layer of immersion and uniqueness to the MMO experience.

The combat system is a standout feature, offering a fast-paced and skill-based approach that keeps engagements exciting. Each class feels distinct, with a variety of combos and abilities that demand practice and mastery. It's a refreshing departure from traditional tab-targeting systems, adding a layer of action-oriented gameplay that keeps encounters dynamic and engaging.

The inclusion of life skills and crafting adds depth to the game, offering a variety of activities beyond combat. Whether it's fishing, trading, or participating in the player-driven economy, there's always something to do for players who enjoy a more relaxed, non-combat aspect of MMOs.

The cooperative aspects of ""Black Desert"" are where the game truly shines. Questing, trading, and engaging in massive guild wars are just a few examples of the collaborative experiences that make playing with friends so enjoyable. The vast world encourages exploration and discovery, and the sense of camaraderie that comes with tackling challenges together is immensely satisfying.

In conclusion, ""Black Desert"" is a monumental achievement in the MMORPG genre. Its stunning visuals, engaging combat system, and wealth of activities make it a standout title. However, it's the shared experiences with friends that truly make this game shine. Whether embarking on epic quests, building trade empires, or engaging in intense battles, ""Black Desert"" is a journey that becomes exponentially more enjoyable when shared with friends. It's a must-play for MMO enthusiasts seeking a rich and vibrant virtual world to explore together.",1673086849,1701684369,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

final fantasy got story, WoW got.. I dunno tbh, BDO got graphics and a great action combat system.

BDO does have a story and a bunch of quests, but u'll end up skipping everything eventually (which BDO luckely allows for the most part)

there have been a bunch of QoL changes like: 
-players get a bunch of shop items from playing and events nowadays and the p2w aspect has been reduced dramatically (personally never felt that it's p2w but as a reference; when I started I spent about 50$ after a short time, if I would start today, I'd spend 27$ for the tent on discount, the rest of the items I would get for free after max 1 month)
-being able to use every storage anywhere.
-easily get mid-range gear so u can enjoy most of the available content after 1 week of relaxed playing.
-teleportation is finally a thing (altho the fee is high enough to kill any veteran if used too often)
-the progression in general has been made easier over the past few years to the point where a casual player can progress without feeling dead inside.
-overall improved minor details which are noticeable to a veteran, but can't rly specify what they are.

the game can get repetitive considering it's main gameplay is some type of grinding (mobs, gathering, weekly/daily quests, etc) so for anyone interested in an MMO, I'd say u would only come to BDO for the graphics and it's phenomenal action combat (altho PvP fights are usually just 5 seconds long and it's just about who lands their stun first)

I have definitely gotten my moneys worth considering my playtime, but at this point I'm just a casual player who stays because I love the graphic and there's not rly any other game out there that has the same type of action combat when it comes to PvE as BDO.

just be warned in case u wish to get the best gear there is; it seems that the devs main strategy has become to create new gear pieces to grind for on a regular basis, they do give options to change ur old gear into the new one so u can continue enhancing rather then having to restart, but u will most likely never get the best gear out there as they will make a new piece once u get close (or right after u finally got it).

there are a bunch of active players, but everyone tends to keep to themselves. there are some guilds that try to be social, but I have gotten more socialisation out of the ""chat group"" chat, then I have from any guilds (PvP guilds are more active internally)",1533778991,1701573352,True,8,3,0.534838080406188965,1,True,False,False

The game overwhelms players with excessive information on the screen, making it difficult to locate essential elements. The quest system's complexity adds to the confusion, requiring improvement for a more user-friendly experience.

Frequent freezes during map transitions disrupt the flow of both combat and non-combat activities. This technical issue hampers the overall gaming experience, demanding optimization to ensure seamless transitions and uninterrupted gameplay.

Controlling horses in Black Desert Online pose a challenge, sometimes horses start drifting and literally end up colliding with walls and fences, the horse riding mechanics are a bit clunky sometimes.

The lack of visible models for gear some items, such as helmets, diminishes the immersive quality of the MMO. Enhancing the visual representation of equipment is essential to create a more engaging and satisfying experience for players who value character customization and aesthetics.

In conclusion, Black Desert Online offers a visually stunning world with a rich array of features, but its shortcomings in controls, technical performance, and gear visibility hinder the overall gaming experience.

To me the selling point of BDO was open world Immersion with the PVP elements. All of that has seemingly disappeared. It has become something akin to WOW in that all aspects of PVP are now regulated and the developers are forcing people into the instanced 3v3 or battleground scenario just like WOW. In WOW that is ok because there is actually PVE content to do, but in BDO all you do is run circles; you run circles to get better gear to run circles in higher grind spots because even most NodeWars and Sieges are gear capped. On top of all this they implemented the marni realm system and made it so you can grind 12 hours out of the day uninterrupted. The game is basically a single player game that limits interaction with players and caters to the nomadic gamer who only comes back for updates while simultaneously alienating and pushing out the loyal base of the game. All the hours and grinding for gear to be competitive lost to a company that caved. Gear is meaningless now in the game except for some of the high end grind spots.

I have played many MMORPGs in my days so I can say Im an experienced player of the style. None are perfect, but if you are going to play an MMORPG give this 1 a try! 
Pros:  Great combat, very smooth and well illustrated!
True sandbox and open world
New quest line is interesting and gives good xp
UI interface is adjustable, and has a clean design
This game is visually Beautiful
Life skills give you plenty to do while also giving income
Lots of bosses and mobs for PVE, duels, raids and node wars for PVP.
Seasonal Servers make it really fast to hit soft cap
All the free stuff you could Ever want, including Pets, horses, inventory space, costumes, ect.
Cons: When you first start playing, can be a bit overwhelming. Need to watch lots of YouTube for this !!
The questing  is sometimes to much talk and fetch, cook, ect.
First time you fight boss you cant see the health bar of that boss. this is because you dont have the knowledge of the boss yet
Choosing the life skills you want  to level up can take time, and can be very costly.
The RNG upgrades of the boss armor n weapons can be  frustration Start with a Season charter and you get free gear that after you graduate you will be able to exchange for  better gear. Again, watching YouTube vids will be a big help. 

 Is game P2W? I would have to say yes and no. in the past maybe, but in the last month game has given away even more free stuff, including a Dream Horse with gear, the Tent winch make grinding a lot easier, and so much more.  Even extra inventory for storing all the free stuff. 
If you have every wanted to play BDO, now is the time,!
I hope you decide to play BDO an enjoy the game as much as I do!",1612335252,1701114944,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Can expect to spam quests for first 5-6 hours of gameplay, skipping loads of dialogue and progressing though a mundane storyline that is neither challenging nor interesting.

In MMORPGs, you generally want to be able to get various sets of armor, loot dungeons, and so on.   There are just two sets of armor in this game... Naru (beginner armor) and Tuvala (non-beginner armor).   They look identical to eachother.   You will be wearing this set of gear for basically the whole game.  When i found this out, I decided to log off and never play again.

The majority of this game is mounting up onto your horse, auto-travelling to next location, spamming quest, and maybe killing 100-150 monsters to complete the quest.   The combat is very basic, just spam your attacks.   Hold down left mouse for basic attacks and then spam your skills when their cooldown is ready.  Really nothing more to it.

The Graphics are some of the best I've seen in gaming, definitely the best of all the MMOs I've played.

The Map, and the traversal around the world is very fun, and a pretty different take compared to its competitors.

The Contribution Point system (that I will not try to explain in this review) is great.

The bad: 

The Pay2Win. If you're reading this, you've probably heard of it. They have toned it down A LOT in recent time, but the monetization is still not in an amazing spot. 

Starting Late. Starting BDO at this current moment is probably the most accessible to newer players it's ever been, but if you go into the game expecting to become one of the top PvP players without spending money at this point, BDO is probably not the game for you.

Progression Pacing. It's a marathon, not a sprint. The reason you will see people have several thousands of hours played on this game, and not gotten all that far is because the progression is incredibly slow-paced (for better or worse). They do add a lot of catch-up mechanics to the game though, so if you're a newer player you get caught up to a certain point pretty quickly.

Content Drought. This game is a Korean MMO. And they cater towards the korean playerbase first and foremost. So if you're playing in a region other than KR, you WILL have to wait a long time for the new content updates to reach your server (we're talking expansions dropping like 6 months later in some cases) because they do not take the time to prepare the content drop for worldwide. 


All in all, this game is not for everybody, and I feel a little bad about recommending it. But, if you read all this and still feel intrigued to try out the game, I say go for it. The strengths of this game are (in my opinion) so extreme that they outweigh the cons.",1506704224,1700982970,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was looking for a good MMORPG with great graphics and combat system. I got exactly what i was after!  I really enjoy that awakening is not so early in the game and it makes every character feel like 2 completely different characters. When you awaken you really feel more powerful. My recommendations: Turn off screen shake in settings. Set up nodes (and level up) to Helms and a few other grinding spots to increase drop rate as soon as you can. Set up a farm but dont spend more than one crop per day or youll get burned out fast.

Heres copy/paste from a comment i left on a Youtube video that got a few hundred likes:

""For $10, its worth it. Just do it like me; don't touch the cash shop at all costs. Yes, there's a grind, but i come from Rappelz where the grind was just as bad or more extreme, so i don't mind it. Grinding takes your mind off it and just listen to music and zone out, forget the real world! The combat, character creator, massive open world, PVP is great once you get geared. Anyone that complains about PVP was just steam rolled because they entered someones rotation/grind spot and is just upset that they lost lol﻿""

Updated: Feb 20, 2022 @ 10:10pm:
The grind has been reduced drastically as a ""catch up"" for new players. What took me 4.5 years casual play you can do in about 7 months if that... if you play more often than me, then maybe even less! Still highly recommend this game if you are after great combat MMO

Updated: November 25th 2023:
Got back into BDO recently after catching up on all the latest Warframe content. Black Desert is still an excellent option when you want an open world MMO that remains to be the best combat of any mmorpg out there. Its actually better now. The latest updates have revamped all characters damage. Ive always grabbed daily login rewards and at some point they gave us a 5 bil crystal, so i redid all my crystals and oh mannnn! i have about 70 extra AP/monster AP, combined with this new damage revamp i can actually grind at places efficiently that drop good loot now!",1540264714,1700965789,True,2,0,0.497367918491363525,0,True,False,False

This MMO manages to pack in something for every kind of player out there, but that actually doesn't mean it will appeal to everyone

Pros (+):
- Beautiful graphics and scenery
- Incredibly extensive character creator
- Events in which you can receive for nothing, among other things: pet
- Increasing the number of slots in your eq by doing main missions
- Ability to create your trading empire by hiring workers
- Very many ways to play: trading, grinding, gathering, cooking, alchemy, etc.
- Dynamic combat system that is focused on different combos
- No items in the item shop that give bonuses like: attack damage, etc.
- Expanded guild system (payout system, wars for territories, guild skils).
- Wars at sea involving cannons and pirates
- A showcase world map
- Economy is controlled by players (but prices mostly stick close to a certain amount)
- Items from is can sometimes be found at the market at affordable prices, but very rarely

Cons (-):
- No pay2win, but pets strongly facilitate the game in a later phase by collecting loot for us.
- It takes some time to learn everything, what and how etc.
- From time to time there are small lags on servers
- Lack of dungeons we know from other games of this type
- Lack of fast travel options (there is a traveler's map, but it has a big cooldown, and besides, you need to own it)
- Quite high prices of is items
- No exchange directly with players, in most cases
- Too much RNG (randomness)

If you are a PvE focused player this game is great, and offers an almost endless progression where YOU choose what to do next.

If you're a PvP enthusiast this games combat and the different classes provide you a way to show off your skills, but at the same time will find that the developer hates this part of the community as it constantly tries to limit the PVP content because they think this is what is desired. The main PVP content used to be open world but now very limited to Node war.

Opening cinematic is GARBAGE and makes literally zero sense. I spent 60 minutes creating a really cute character (easily the best part of the game) and 20 minutes sitting through the opening and I still have actually, literally zero idea what the story of the game is. Like, actually no idea whatsoever. It's the most shallow, nonsense setup for a skinner box I've ever had the displeasure of being REQUIRED to sit through. Yep, can't skip. Also, you can't change any of your settings throughout the entire thing, so I hope you didn't pick ""super ultra realistic remastered"" graphics or you're exiting the game and going back to the main menu or powering through at 20fps.

_______________________________
_____________Pros______________
-You can cop it for like 5$ on sales or even for free
-Good graphics
-Best combat system out of any mmo hands down
-Open world with great scenery
-There's forced PvP (you can flag up and attack anyone above lvl 56 outside of safe zone)
-There is quite a lot to do in the game*
-20+ classes with play styles ranging from one handed boomer to cracked out zoomer
-The game is much more new player friendly allowing someone to gear up in seasonal in under a week and make competitive money compared to end game grindspots*
______________________________
_____________Cons______________
-There is quite a lot to do in the game*
-Cash shop is pretty incentivized but its not that overpowered, basically buy a 50$ item from shop + the game for 5$ on sale and u have a 55$ price tag
-A good bit of the content is surface level, or forgotten about and obsolete
-There seems to be a large disconnect between the developers and the NA/EU community (even though NA/EU is the majority of Pearl Abyss' income)
-In game if your fps is around 200, you move faster and your animations go off faster than if you were at 60fps, thus allowing more overall dps by just having a superior PC
-This game has hella spaghetti code that allows for two players with 14 ping to still experience desync
-Even though u can gear up quick the new player experience is horrible*",1637821965,1700858860,True,0,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Now its pay for appearance and convenience items. Buffs on paid items are rather negligible and wont affect game-play. Fantastic looking graphics, though it could use some polish when it comes to apparel clipping through stuff. Season servers / Novice servers are NOT PvP and the rest of the servers ARE PvP. Your season character is locked to a certain extent of gear progression and you may only have 1 Season character. You aren't required to ever ""graduate"" your character and remain on season servers for as long as you wish. Also: you can freely change servers at any time with the exception of non-season characters not being allowed to hop over to Season servers.

Heavy server issues, sometimes unplayable due to server lag. If a game is not ready to accommodate a certain amount of players it should not be made free, this mistake made pve much more difficult and pvp completely impractical, this is unacceptable in a mmo.
If you try to do alternative activities other than pve/pvp you get moved on other servers, and when you change character the loading time for NPCs is endless.

Edit: Most of the free player leaved the game due to the heavy grinding mechanic (at least this is what i think, based on the server chat) so now the game is mostly back to normal, except for the daily/weekly mass PvP (nodewar/siege) on which you can experience the same lag as before.
Long story short, I'll make some examples to make you understand the situation: on 4/05/2020 nodewar servers were totally offline, the day after the nodewar server were so laggy that doing PvP was not possible and no one got the victory, on saturday (Siege day) PvP started an hour late because people kept disconnecting..",1575054511,1700780221,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

So, I've played a bit and I think that I'm ready to finally post a short 'review' of the game.

In BDO you will never be bored. Never-ever. There's always something to do, either improve your equipment or sail the endless horizon, or discover new locations or train your mounts or get into one of many professions (life skill) and try out one of hundreds of recipes for your [i]magic blue potion[/i] or ...there's too much to list here.

This game is very addictive and [b]very[/b] heavy on your wallet (especially if you do not earn in USD or EUR). I would not say that it is P2W, as I was invested around 800h of game play before I decided to use my wallet and I was managing just fine.

[b]STORY (LORE):[/b]
If you're familiar with Lineage II story - it's not that good. If you're familiar with BnS story - you'll see some similarities, yet it's quite different.
Is it any good ? - I'd say 'yes'. It's not a masterpiece in any means, but it's quite catchy and the script is pretty good written (even though there are some cliche').
Is it long ? - the main quest line took me 5 days (18h per day) on my season character, with a side quest here and there ;) It was not a speed run and I was reading / watching every cut scene and treating it mostly like an interactive book than a game.

The side quests are pretty awesome, they will give you more insight into what was really going on in the background of main events and sometimes even they'd present you with crucial info. that'd help you making your decisions later. Yes - you can choose your own path (to some extend ofc.)
I'll be honest - I find the side questing and side story-lines more enjoyable than the main one; especially in case of few NPC's that I feel like I've made bond with (I know how that sounds lol).

[b]GAMEPLAY:[/b]
You can be whoever you want to be. You can do whatever you want to do.
...yea, basically that'd sum it up.

[b]GRAPHICS:[/b]
Remastered. That's your aim.
It still looks pretty decent on lower settings, but to get the most of the beautiful and breathtaking scenery - you'll need to be able to run it on Remastered. Absolutely gorgeous.

[b]CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION:[/b]
As some of you already know - I'm a junkie for a good editor.
Black Desert offers one of the best ones out there. It still does lack in regard to the hair customization and the hair physics are broken, but you can't have everything, right ? ;)

Oh, the servers should be up by now, so let's wrap it up with a...
[b]SUMMARY:[/b]
It's one of the best MMORPG out there, and even though it have its own issues - it is definitely worth to try.

There are countless things that you can do, and there are even hundreds/thousands of hours worth of things to do if you don't want to do the PvE grind or even the PvP. You can play however you want, and you can try all sorts of different systems. The biggest issue with this is the lack of many tutorials which makes the overwhelming flood of information pretty insane, but Pearl Abyss has been doing an excellent job of making QoL changes since other MMORPGs like FF14 started to dominate the market. FF14 was the best thing to happen to BDO. To make up for the overwhelming amount of stuff, watch the plethora of helpful people on Youtube, but take care of toxic MMO players that can really rip noobs a new one. 

Because BDO can be played at your own speed, there doesn't feel like there are any problems with taking long breaks if you get bored. But with the constant changing seasons with expedited progression, new items, new ways to progress your gear, events, and the upcoming class reworks, it keeps the game fresh and inviting,

Edit: 300 hours later and while I don't play as often, the game still draws me back every so often.

If you're looking for ""MMORPG"" in which u mostly do everything solo, the game is for you.
The game used to have alot of decent pvp aspects like going in negative karma, declaring wars to guilds to fight them(now its gone), alot of open world pvp (now its completely dead). For end game you have absolutely nothing to do as a pvp player, Sieges are purely politics (ppl choose who to fight so you have 1v1's only). Your gear doesnt matter much anymore because most instanced pvp's have caps to ap/dp. 
Pve in this game consists of endless grinding in one circle. Every new MAJOR update is just dead after 1-2 weeks because its mostly just a new grindspot to run around circles once again. 
For lifeskills u might find the game a bit better than pve/pvp, theres a bit more different to do for lifeskilling.

---

I am updating my review on this game due to how much the game has changed. The game used to be playable for easily over 1000 hours before you hit any pay to win elements. They have removed a ton of that, if not all. They have seasons now that let new players catch up to veterans pretty fast. You can reach ""nearly end game"" quality gear from a season, but still left with room to advance if you are chasing combat power. The in game shop only sells things for convenience, and nowadays they offer in game methods to acquire all the same items. The in game methods are not extreme in any way and are very easily obtainable. The only people really spending money on the in game shop are those who want a special cosmetic, or those too impatient to wait a week or two to get the item for free in game. The items I am referring to are things like a tent to repair your armor on the go, pets to pick up loot or provide very small buffs, a horn to call your horse from further away and so on. None of the items are game breaking and are all obtainable in game also. 

They give TONS of stuff away for free. Just having an account and checking in every so often ensures your account piles up with free stuff waiting for when you come back from a break. They even sometimes give the entire game away for free when it's not already just 5 dollars to buy. At some point they have given me just about every in game shop item for free and some of them I've received dozens. My account received so many free paid for cosmetic outfits that I actually destroyed a lot of them to get the materials. I currently have over 120 days worth of the free VIP account buffs like traveler's pack and old moon book all received for free. 

Moving on, a lot of people who do not like this game are not used to open sandbox games. The game is split into Combat and Life skill. People who focus on combat and nothing else will find the gameplay loop gets repetitive fast. If you go farm for money to work on gear upgrades you may end up farming the same 1 spot repeatedly for hours because it's the best spot YOU can do currently. It can take weeks to get enough to finish 1 upgrade. You upgrade combat gear to go to a harder spot in the future or for pvp. To most people it doesn't seem rewarding. That's because it's only a small part of what you are supposed to be doing. 

The entire game is very quickly accessible by everyone so people get lost on what they are ""supposed to do"". You are supposed to do nothing, but you GET to do anything There are in game systems to let you run essentially a company or empire of npcs who gather resources for you, intricate life skill systems for breeding better mounts, fishing, cooking, alchemy, house decorating, sailing, bartering between islands, transporting and trading goods, and especially combat and pvp. If you are not interested in dabbling or playing a bit in all aspects then you may find your gameplay loop repetitive. It really is sort of a slice of life game where you get to decide how to play and co-exist in a world where other people are doing the same. 

The game is absolutely beautiful and to this day may be the best mmo out in terms of graphics. In terms of combat, there is no other game that is still active at the time of this review that even compares to the combat system that BDO offers. It's incredibly smooth and very satisfying. All characters/classes are viable and you really can just choose which one feels best to you with no worries. The game is incredibly immersive and if you play other mmo's you may be shocked how so many little things make the world feel so much better. Rotted wood texture in fishing towns, running through water or puddles gets your boots wet but not your shirt, rain wetting the road and your clothes, snow piling up on your horse saddle, so many other well down subtle aspects make it great to explore the world and find all the hidden areas. The desert and open ocean have their own struggles to navigate which makes traveling have more weight to your decisions. You see someone somewhere remote and know they had a similar experience and struggle to get there. 

Overall the game is great and it's way better now than it ever was before now.

The combat is amazing, experiment with all the classes til you find what you really like...

It's rare that you'll find yourself without something to do in this game, there's always something.

Buuuut...
If you're not used to MMOs that are disgusting RNG and grinding fests or you're just plain impatient... don't play this game.

Play it with a friend(s), It gets boring alone, I've heard of people who play it alone and still really enjoy it but... Its just WAY more fun with other people.

11/7/2018 edit:
If you're expecting a casual fun experience all the way to end game and enjoyable pvp... lol, this probably isn't game for you. If you aren't dont have the time to grind hours a day and spend the next year fighting through rough RNG before you can even be considered a threat in the pvp scene. If you're down for the pain train... Go for it, Its not a bad game

2/19/19 edit: Screw it... I'm gonna have to go to private servers. The retail server's routing is overloaded and its been weeks that I cant even change characters without being stuck in a lag screen for 5 minutes before being closed out of the game because of a disconnect. 
Might come back to retail one day, but Its unplayable as hell right now for me. 

9/24/21 edit: Game is way different than I remember... much more casual friendly. I cant really get myself back in to it though.

9.2/10 MMORPG

I used to play this game for the first time back in 2014 in KR Closed Beta.
I managed to play in EU closed beta and after like 1 year in EU and 2 years from KR I might say is one of the TOP-BEST played MMORPG's i ever played.

World
At the first sights is alive and so close to a real edge of the world, game used to happen in a fantasy Europe in XVII century.

Gameplay
As an MMORPG it has quest,combat,skills,gear and many more...
Introducing life skilling... what this actually means?
Gathering,Processing,Cooking,Alchemy,Training,Fishing,Hunting,Trading,Farming,Sailing and soon Wall Climbing and many more sport-adventure based coming in the next big expansions.

Combat
Fast-paced smooth,lots of effects and feels so nice and such a pleasure.
Combat with mobs is not target based is free-based like an hack and slash.

Characters (Costumization + Own persoanllity wannabe)
A feature that's actually one of the bests inside the game..... also is the only game in the world i might say that has such a vast costumization.

Community
Here comes a bit sad abou but depends of you mostly... I'm an EU veteran and i used to play in KR,NA.
EU = helpfull people but also trolls and savage ones..
NA = well anybody could help you..
KR = helpfull and also.. if lvl 60+ most of the people are just tryharding because KR.. but still good..

Graphics
Amazing and is so near the reality... no more words..
But some anti aliasing + some more effects and some Very High textures won't hurt anyone right?

B2P and P2W?
Is worth to buy the game to support development besiedes that in KR is free to play but for others outside KR, you will need to pay 10E/$ to buy an acc so... no reasons...

P2W?
No way in EU/NA but in KR P2W it seems ok for them so..
Is not P2W in EU ?
Yep i played for a lot of time so i assure you ...
Why?
Pearl shop sellers could sell only 35 pearl items and max value in market is 355 mil 355x35 = 12.B l not a huge amount of money i assure you dear players..
But that 12 Bil ...?
And what ? Everyboy has a chance to get that pearl shop items i assure you, I own over 35+ outfits on and also 3 value packs + lots of dyes... (I spent over 950 mil on all of those from marketplace) yeah you spent hours/days but is worth..

Classes 
Actually this MMORPG has 20 awesome classes all being pretty well balanced and owning a pretty nice persoanllity & lore.

Warrior: Longsword + Shield + an Awakening Weapon: Greatsword
Ranger: Bow + Dagger + an Awakening Weapon: Kamasylven Sword
Sorceress: Amulet + Talisman + an Awakening Weapon: Scythe
Berserker: Double axe + Knot + an Awakening Weapong: Iron Buster (Hand Canon)
Tamer:
Valkyrie
Musa
Maehwa
Ninja
Kunoichi
Wizzard
Witch
Dark Knight
Striker
Lahn
Archer
Shai
Guardian
Hashashin

Skills & Gear

Lots of skills which are on categorized in 2 types:
Normal and Awakening
There is a new feature of 2020 called ""Succession"" an upgraded version of Pre-Awakening or (Normal) mostly made up for PvE
Also this game requiers lots of knowledge in knowing other classes combos+skills and also to learn some very critical combos on your main classes.

Gear is mostly a main thing in this game as others RPG's.
Is based by 4 colors/rank-quality color.
White/None = Common
Green = Uncomon
Blue = Mid-rare
Yellow = Rare
Orange/Red = Legendary 

Game World & Exapansions

At first around 2016 game came up with the expansion up to only Calpheon, later on around Spring end of 2016 there was Mediah Expansion released, alongside in the end of summer was Valencia Expansion and Awakening until the end of December 2016 also in november 2016 there was the first phase of ocean content, called Margoria.
In 2017 there were many other changes, Kamasylve is released just at the begging of October 2017, around that in November we get the Vell Expansion.

2018 Comes just strong as is releasing in just November the Drieghan release alongside Archer class.

2019 May to July comes with 2 medium size expansions one at the month, Sycaria and Black Star (Star's End) also Shai is released.

In 2020, 7 October we are going to get the O'dyllita expansion one of the biggest and hardest content produced for now in BDO at the time of 2020.

As of 2023, I went casually but game greatly impoved in terms of P2W, classes, balance and content, we even had dungeons something that in 2017 I have not even pictured but imaginated.",1495881362,1700598998,True,43,1,0.634761273860931396,6,True,False,False

There is an incredible amount of content in this game, the only thing is that there are also an incredible number of bugs, some of which have existed for years.

Example: The Maegu class was released, but this class was so broken and OP that they had to nerv it, but that wasn't possible because otherwise it would cause a game breakink bug...
so they had to buff ALL the other 25 classes, so that everyone is up again...

Unfinished and broken content is constantly being released, some of which will be completed/fixed years later (T10 Doom, PVP area in Odraxxia, Ship content, Elvia realm, etc.)

Sounds ridiculous, but that's BDO, beautiful and shiny on the outside but behind the scenes a pile of rubbish.

P2W: Yes it is, kind of like Lost Ark just in a different way!

Would I recommend it....

Yes, but only if you don't have an addiction problem with gambling.

There is a ton of free content in this game.
You can have fun for weeks/months, but you should be VERY careful with the cash shop and don't look too closely behind the scenes of the game, because there you will find a pile stuck together with glue and nails!

[h2] PROS: [h2]
[list]
[*]Amazing character creator.
[*]Good graphics for an MMO
[*]Boob sliders. Errybody likes boobies.
[*]A ton of different classes each with 2 specs that you can swap between to get the playstyle you prefer.
[*]Amazing action combat akin to a hack and slash game mixed with fighting game mechanics. Combos are KING.
[*]Great Screenshot mode with control over the time of day, filters, depth of field, camera zoom and tilt, even character poses! Very nice for the screenshot enjoyers out there like myself!
[*]Massive map to explore and enjoy. Even an Ocean which you can sail over and fight sea monsters with ships!
[*]Group dungeons/ Grind zones where you can go as sweaty or chill as you want.
[*]You get a good start on the game with seasonal characters which you get to keep when you max out their gear and keep going on regular gear/servers. Season characters don't wipe like other games traditional seasons.
[*]Player driven economy/market.
[*]Gathering/ Cooking/ Alchemy/ Horse Training/ Other ""lifeskills"" all play into the market/economy in their own ways.
[*]You can make passive income through AFK activities so if you work a lot you can still make progress. Its not as much as actively playing but its still nice.
[*]Offers a Battle Arena to go and practice your characters skills and combos against training dummies or real players. Be warned though people in there can be kinda... big headed I'll say. Thick skin recommended.
[*]Tons of help out there online for this game.
[*]The best autorun/pathing system. You right click a quest or a place on the map screen, press T and your character will ride/ run there automatically. Its SO convenient!
[*]A fully customizable UI. You can hide so much crap with Customize UI its great! You can even add to the clutter by tracking skill cooldowns, or if you're really feeling devious you can drag everything into a corner overlaying them on top of each other so you can't tell what the hell is going on over there. Its up to you!
[*]Tons of support options through the settings menus. Don't like the crazy screen shake? Turn it down in the camera settings for example.
[*]No sub Just 10$ once and that's it. Free to play viable. Not optimal, but viable.
[*]The gear matched PvP Arena is coming back soon and becoming permanent.
[/list]

[h2] CONS: [h2]
[list]
[*]Endgame gear progression is very slow or luck based. KR MMO very grindy who would've guessed it
[*]It gets lonely doing solo grinding all the time.
[*]Its a pro and a con, but there is a lot to learn and it can be easy to get overwhelmed on what the heck to do early on.
[*]The devs made changes to absolutely kill open world PvP outside of the Arsha Server, and also made it so that you can no longer place a guild war on a person who is being an annoying idiot trying to take your mobs at a grind zone. They can just decline the war so you have to switch servers, go negative karma which has all kinds of bad possibilities attached to it, or ignore them and hope they get bored and go away.
[*]The siege wars are very laggy, not just client side, but the server itself. When everyone gets to the castle its rubberband city.
[*]I cant get an Elten Piece :(
[*]The devs don't know how to buff Kunoichi properly :(

[h3] [i] All in all I like this game a lot and I think the pros outweigh the cons. If you are a PvE focused player this game is great, and offers an almost endless progression where YOU choose what to do next. If you're a PvP enthusiast you will LOVE this games combat and the different outlets they provide for you to show off your skills or just laugh it up in discord with some buddies. It really is something special to me because of all the people I've met through the games' community and the memories we have made.

I'm so disgusted and aggravated I have uninstalled it and requested a refund. I tried searching online to find info about the missing interface settings and found no useful information.

The game has so much stuff to grind, its mindblowing. 
The only downsides are that the game has the worst beginner experience ever. you either need very thick skin or someone to guide you through the game., and it doesnt really offer good raiding content like Lost ark or FF14 does.

BDO is insanely complex, It is basically Path of exile on crack. 

Its also a sandbox mmorpg, meaning u can play at your own pace and it offers way more freedom than themepark mmorpgs.
In this game you choose however you want to play. want to grind mobs in circles for 10 hours in a row? no problem at all. 
want to lifeskill all day and gather mats, then cook them or craft other stuff with it? also no problem.
you can also go out and hunt animals with a matchlock or sail and do many other things. 
Everything gets leveled and becomes more profitable over time.
The more active play something requires, the more profit it will net you generally speaking. 
It goes to the point of being completely afk like fishing which gives u few amounts of money, but its basically an idle game at that point and you can play something else while still progressing in BDO. 

Also worth mentioning is how lifeskilling also has its own level and gear progression, which is on a similar level as the combat gear progression. 

No matter how you wanna grind, BDO will offer something for you.
If you dont wanna grind, then stay away, but if you are into grinding, then i recommend you to get through the miserable beginner experience and learn how the game works. only then you can judge this game. it may end up being your favorite",1675129201,1699924826,True,2,0,0.399237751960754395,0,True,False,False

Nowadays, Pay to Win is almost completely dead and non existent in this game, so anyone still telling you the game is P2W is either lying or hasn't played in years.

You never have to pay for the new classes when they release, nor do you have to pay for the new expansions to the map when those release. The game does a good enough job of being a good game that I didn't feel bad about buying myself some cosmetics from the shop, but they give those same cosmetics away for free during events all the time, so you really don't even have to pay for those either.

The game is not perfect, but if u just play the mainstory which is pretty long with an season charackter u will get so many things for free. Mounts, armor, weapon, pets its all free u have just to play the fucking game u crybabys. Just ignore all the microtransactions, if u dont plan to go hardcore PvP then there is no problem with the given content. 

U will even get special events with random free dresses for what u have to pay normaly money. Yes this game is not perfect but in my eyes a solid 8/10. I mean for 3€ they need to put some microtransactions. New world what was hyped af and is boring af and in my eyes a 4/10. So why the fuck u still praise New World but putting this game in dirt??? Combat, graphics exspecally if u put in remaster mode looks so freaking good, soundtrack, fishing, gathering, riding the horse and using the abilities feels really good and is fun and in every aspect superior to New world.

So forgett all the braindead casual reviews and just play the mainstory with ignoring all microtransactions. U will get loyalty points anyway and u can buy some stuff for free for JUST PLAYING THE GAME!

When u burned out and had fun just remember u payed only 3€-10€. Absolutely worth it btw this game gives me kinda Metin2 vipes which is good and brings nostalgic back, dont even know why.
PS. U can also use AFK farming which is already in the game implemented. Also if u get lost with the missions just follow the season pass progress which is also free.



So originaly i had thumbs up, but because steam has no mixed review, i give this after 500 hours thumbs down. The reasons, first many things what should be free and cost in game money are not. Pearl Abyss butchering themself with trying to make everything a cash cow. Why changing ur charackter model and dying cloths cost real money??? Plus in game money is completely useless and the economy is brocken. Nobody listens outfit boxes in the market. So whats the point i have 1.000.000.000.000 money if i cant buy anything i want, with it???? Plus it gives way too many events and login rewards, its bloating everything too much and stresses players cause they have fear too miss always something out. The game engine is not uptoday and pop-ins are eye cancer. Its not the worst game and sometimes decent, but trying to milk everything and make this game hardcore pay-to-win is not the best decision. I just feel the devs become way too greedy, make more things avaible for free, give the players more freedom, stop milking every inch. I think at this point i will just wait for Gta6 online and hope they can give me an good open world. Its sad this game looks gorgeous, charackter models and customisation is amazing but why u dont make it for free or little in game money, like going to a barter. Make player to player traiding possible. I cant support such greed and bad decisions.",1696477235,1699700725,False,0,0,0.502245545387268066,0,True,False,False

Step 2: Make the same class in as a seasonal one (it will remain after season ends), that way you have a bunch of exp boost

Step 3 (optional): get yourself a nice outfit or wait for an event, you dont wonna look at boring outfits. Some arent as boring, most armors also have unique skins, so thats a plus.

Step 4: ignore lore (I tried to stay with it, go with the story, its very... uhhh... not for everyone, i may try to redo the story some day when I have a lot of free time for reading)

Truthfully, I've never seen a game that had abilities and moves that look as cool or as fun as they do in this game. Second- the moves. Each character has a ridiculous amount of moves they can do that are exclusive to their class, there are a lot of moves and therefor a lot of controls to memorize which something I personally enjoy. Third- the price. This game is usually only $10 but goes on sale for less than that quite frequently, meaning that it's a good game to maybe dump and hour or two into every once in a while if you're bored and don't have anything else to play. These are (in my opinion) the only redeeming qualities of this game.
      I've personally always thought the idea of fighting with your fists and training nothing but your body was a cool concept. And I was delighted when I found out that there was a character that allowed me to do precisely that. But he sucks, his fighting style is clunky and in his awakening, he starts to rely on magic which completely ruins the whole point of being a pugilist and just fighting with your fists. Learning how badly they fumbled him crushed me to no end, they took something I love, destroyed what I love most about it, and made him so bad that he isn't even a viable character.
      Despite the combat and abilities looking cool and fun, they are not. The game's too easy, the mobs die in seconds and most of the time they don't even get the chance to hit you, and in the off chance they do manage to get close and hit you, it hardly does any damage. Some people like to play games that make you feel overpowered, but this game doesn't even do that- You hit something a few times and it dies, but you don't feel powerful. Killing an enemy is tedious and doesn't feel rewarding in any way.
      The combat isn't fun, I've tried 4 different characters and none of them had combat that kept the game interesting for more than the time it took me to learn the moves. When you hit something, it doesn't even feel like you hit it. When you fight using melee characters, it's hard to land moves consecutively because the moves themselves move your character too much and you need to completely stop your attacks in order to reposition you character so you can actually hit them.
As for the story, there really isn't one. You run around doing other people's jobs while coincidentally progressing the main story even though you literally haven't done anything remotely related to what your characters ""objective"" is. The voice acting is atrocious and the the mouths of the NPCs move randomly. There's no rhyme or reason behind the body language used by the NPCs in conversation either, just senseless flailing.
      The combat in this game is what I hate the most, but right after that are the characters themselves- more specifically, the gender lock. I prefer to play male character in most games, but this game doesn't give me that choice. If there's a character you like, then you're stuck playing that character as whatever gender the game decided to make them. Some characters have a male and a female counterpart that you can choose from, but even then it's not the same because the only thing they share is general character idea. Take the pugilist I love for example, there's both a male and a female pugilist, but practically none of there moves are the same. They have great customization in every other regard, but they are sorely lacking in the one of the most basic and important forms of character creation.
      The game looks cool and had the potential to be good, but they fumbled in almost every way imaginable. I find myself coming back to this game from time to time because I think of what it could have been, and every time I'm met with disappointment.",1698744975,1699337494,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now the game still has problems. Tons of currencies and stuff which comes with games structured like this to extract cash from you that the game really doesn't deserve. 

All that being said, you can have a lot of fun in BDO. If they streamlined it and removed a lot of the currencies and stuff this would be much more successful. But the grind for some of these items and feeling like you have to use the cash shop really puts a damper on a lot of players sticking around. Now BDO has changed a lot for the better. I love it for that. It's a beautiful game with a community that is pretty neat. I love that there is personal housing and you can buy anywhere you want. That is amazing and the farming. I really like being a profession person. I like running around on my SHAI and gathering everything up and crafting. The node system could be used in way more games and the sailing is pretty refreshing and cool. as well. I wish more games did stuff like this. However this doesn't appeal to the more casual side. But you can be casual in here. There are many guides on it.

I wanted to customize a cool character and that was played out pretty quickly. One thing they must fix for that is the EYE color palates. One of the main eye colors you can't scroll down and see all the colors. Very irritating. But I still made a good looking character and started to play. As for the game itself. The story was interesting at first. But very quickly it gets played out. You just press R for every quest. No matter what you are doing besides random fights where you kill everything in one hit you just press R, everywhere you go R R R R. By the time I cleared the first continent I was around lvl 43. Then it basically stops telling you where to go and when you figure out how to teleport to the new area, everything is way lower level than you are. Even if I run all the way over to where mobs are my level, I kill them in 1 hit, there is no challenge. No quests in those areas. It feels like a mobile game that was slapped onto the computer, which players in game tell me it is. One thing that I do like about this game is the auto run feature though. They did a great job with navigating to quests when you have them and being able to watch a show or something on another screen while it runs. I really do like that they did that. It helps a lot. I would never have played this long if it didn't have that. Seems to be a helpful community and plenty of people playing. The chat is full of random conversations that are interesting. But very quickly this game burned me out. There just isn't enough involvement in the actual game to get into it. If you decide to play this game, I recommend joining a guild right off the bat, and joining a discord and having them help you with questions. There is just too much content in the game for me to figure out what everything is or try to search every last little item and it's function to warrant the time investment.

Horrible game design, nothing explained properly. Game is not well laid out. 100% WOULD not RECOMMEND to friends.

Game has some very interesting features though.  Fun to play some of the afk features, but in the end you are 100% better off playing some other non asian grind mmo. ESO and new world to just name 2 games are way better laid out and train you to play the game rather then have to play constant look up on google or guessing games. Old poorly made game with great graphics.

Ah, where do I even begin? It's like a never-ending rollercoaster ride that only goes downhill, and not in a good way. If you're looking for a game that will consume your life, drain your wallet, and make you question your life choices, then look no further – Black Desert is here to ruin your day!

Let's talk about character creation, shall we? It's so detailed that you'll spend hours perfecting your virtual alter ego's nose hair, only to realize that you'll be wearing a helmet most of the time. Who needs facial features anyway, right? But hey, if you ever decide to take off that helmet, you'll have the most magnificent nose hairs in all of the gaming world.

Now, let's not forget the joy of grinding in Black Desert. You can spend weeks tirelessly slaughtering thousands of the same mobs, just to progress slightly in the game. It's like Groundhog Day, but instead of Bill Murray, you have your character endlessly slaughtering poor defenseless critters. I'm sure your character will need some serious therapy by the time you're done.

And the quest system, oh boy! You'll be asked to kill 10,000 wolves, gather a gazillion herbs, or retrieve your neighbor's lost sock – all while the NPCs drone on with their never-ending dialogues. I swear, even my cat lost interest in their tales of woe.

Let's not forget about the pearl shop, where you can buy virtual items that are more expensive than your first car. Want to look like a cool ninja? Better get ready to fork over your rent money for some virtual costume pieces.

And if you think you can just hop in for some casual PVP fun, think again. You'll be obliterated by players who have spent their entire lives in the game, achieving the level of power only rivaled by Marvel superheroes. Good luck surviving those encounters!

Black Desert MMO is like that bad relationship you just can't quit. You'll keep coming back, hoping things will get better, but they won't. It's a game that will make you question your life choices, your sanity, and your financial responsibility.

In conclusion, Black Desert MMO is a game that's guaranteed to suck the joy out of your life, drain your wallet, and turn you into a virtual nose hair perfectionist. But hey, at least it's good for a laugh... as long as you're not the one playing it.",1683726717,1698884976,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Also EVERY LITTLE THING in the game throws you to the Pearl Shop. I get it that if you want to get the full experience of the game, you have to spend some money, but in this game it is just unrealistic and not rewording.

1.Excessive Grind: The game is notorious for its high grind, where players must spend a significant amount of time performing repetitive, routine tasks. This can make the experience feel monotonous and dull.
2.Pay-to-Win Elements: While the game was not originally pay-to-win, over the years, more pay-to-win elements have been introduced, such as stat-boosting items that can be purchased with real money, potentially disrupting game balance.
3.Lack of Content Development: Despite the variety of content offered, some players feel that the developers have not given enough attention to existing content and have been more focused on monetizing the game.

Rewriting this since I started playing again. Been playing for a couple of months now and liking it again.

Positive
- Big open world with no loading screens, which is expanded on a yearly basis or so
- You can keep progressing over time starting with your gear progression and then later on you can grind for various QoL perks like infinite potions and permanent market place tax reduction.
- Open world PvP (not for new players/season instances). Chase people away from your PvE spot by flagging up and whacking them over their fucking head!
- They are currently improving and implementing permanent sPvP.
- Devs play the game themselves and listen to the community (not that they always hit home with their changes, but at least they try)
- Very wide range of ways to play and enjoy this game everything from lifeskilling (sailing, horse training, alchemy, hunting, fishing, lumbering, gathering, farming), enhancing, PvP, PvE.
- Sandbox like large scale PvP where players fight for nodes and regions to obtain guild-wide buffs for a period of time.
- Endgame where you can grind for what you feel like and get good at what you want.
- Fighting-game-like inputs for combat

Cons / Reasons I quit last time:
- Had a very slow job that took a lot of time and didn't feel like spending my remaining time grinding. I now have a job with more action and find it nice to chill with BDO after work.
- Flavor of the year classes, some classes clearly remain superior for a long time. Feels bad when you know the class you enjoy is a dumpster fire and everyone else can grind faster with less actions per minute than you.
-  Power creep and catch-up mechanics are a natural part of this game for better or for worse.

Curiously this games bugs and flaws and uh ""story"" sort of become something you like about it. It can be a bit rough around the edges here and there but like that good old car it just keeps on going. I came back for the free dream horse event but decided to stay because man, this game is vast and makes me actually feel like a bit of an adventurer sometimes.

My journey in this game has been a rollercoaster of frustration, thanks to the less-than-welcoming player base.

The in-game world is breathtaking, with a level of detail that is truly awe-inspiring. The character customization options are unparalleled, and the combat system offers a satisfying blend of action and strategy. Yet, beneath this beautiful veneer lies a community that has made my gaming experience more bitter than sweet.

Toxicity among players is unfortunately not an uncommon sight in Black Desert Online. Whether you're a new player trying to find your footing or a seasoned veteran seeking help, you may encounter a barrage of unsolicited insults, elitism, and condescension from others. This hostility can be discouraging for newcomers, making it difficult for them to enjoy the game and progress.

The in-game chat channels are rife with derogatory comments, and it's not uncommon to witness players arguing over trivial matters. It's disheartening that the toxic behavior isn't confined to one particular aspect of the game but is instead pervasive across various channels, from general chat to guild interactions.

While I understand that online gaming communities can be challenging, the level of toxicity in Black Desert Online often surpasses what one might expect. Rather than fostering a welcoming environment that encourages new players to explore and enjoy the game, this community does the opposite. It perpetuates a hostile atmosphere that can detract from the enjoyment of the game itself.

In conclusion, Black Desert Online is a visually stunning and immersive MMORPG that is marred by the negative aspects of its player community. While the game itself has much to offer, it's essential to consider the impact of the toxic community on your overall gaming experience. If you can overlook the community and focus solely on the game's content, you may still find enjoyment here, but be prepared to navigate the minefield of negativity that often surrounds it.",1698545123,1698545123,False,0,0,0.477941185235977173,1,True,False,False

The game is a korean grinder with a somewhat aggressive cash shop, so depends if you know your limits or not.

Game is not a theme park mmo, so as soon as you are done with the tutorial story you need to decide what you want to do, this is a problem for some since they need to be led about.

This game is a completely open world mmo so you can actually pick a direction and go there, you don't need to finish all the story to unlock different areas of the map, although you may get walloped :D
Following the black spirit quest line as a new player is the best idea, with a season character.

However there is an overwhelming amount of stuff to do and grind for, as the veterans always say BDO is a marathon not a sprint.

The main thing that first attracted me to BDO was the horse training which is surprisingly complicated, the horse animations and skills are very satisfying to use. The mounts also don't spawn out of your characters butt like in most games, when you dismount they are still there in the world, which I think is wonderfully immersive. 
There is also all the other usual lifeskills such as gathering, farming, cooking, alchemy, sailing, fishing, hunting, trading and bartering.

Gaming the economy is not really a thing in this game since max and min price of things is managed by the developers, there is also no player trading so don't expect it to be like EVE or ARCHEAGE in this respect.
BDO also has a pretty good housing system with lots of choices of house locations for convenience, roleplay or simple looks reasons and lots of choices when it comes to furniture items. 
Also there is no large inital cost or lack of housing, and no loss of said house/houses when you have a break from the game, everything is how you left it when you return.
Almost all the cash shop furniture can now be crafted for free now, which is amazing.

The action combat is first rate, I think of all the mmos I have played only TERA has better combat, BDO's mob grinding is better though. 
Which is just as well since grinding mobs is a huge part of the game and can be a decider as to whether you will like the game or not. (nothing like putting on some music and killing thousands of critters)

This game doesn't do dungeons like most mmos do, it has only 3 which are parts of the same dungeon.
Visually they are lovely but I think mechanically they are clunky and the reliance on having to use guides is a problem.
If you have played WOW, Final fantasy or Destiny 2 you will find these raids disappointing in comparison.

BDO has never been known for its story and it still isn't, some of the newest story content is fully voiced and is quite good, however unfortunately some of the earliest story/tutorial is a real slog.

Also the quality of life in this game is through the roof, every option you can think of for turning stuff off or on, or adjusting UI. 
Search bars for items/npcs and all items have a proper description and will have a auto path to the npc they need to go to, on a right click.
The autopathing is a pleasure, the knowledge system is great and contributes to your entire account. 
All of your alts have access to almost everything on your account; storage/mounts/pets, its just one big Family, which is very convenient.

Gearing is actually way easier than it was when I started playing in 2017; with the season servers, its almost obscene how much easier it is now, with benefits new and old players alike, a very good change. 
The upgrading of gear and the system of doing it are pretty complicated and much complained about but the season servers really do act as a great tutorial for how to works and if you'd prefer to just avoid it and just grind and buy what you want from the marketplace.

Cosmetics are some of the best and most detailed in any mmo however the best of them are in the cashshop, so be aware of that if it bothers you. 
The game is very cheap to buy or often free to try with no subscription requirement I don't think its a big deal, there is also ones you can get with a loyalty system/giveaways if you can be patient.
The dye system is extremely good and has many slots to achieve that specific look and is one of the main reasons its nice to have the optional subscription; The value pack.
If you are going to play the value pack is definitely worth having and has a lot of convenience. 
However the game has no required subscription, so you can just login whenever you feel like it.

The character creation is still one of the best in any mmo or even more modern games, which is kinda crazy and you can completely change your characters face or hair if you get sick of it, provided you have the value pack.

BDO is probably the best most complete open world/seamless mmo on the market, only New world looks better graphically.
The areas of the map look like they fit together naturally like they would in real life, some of the cities are actually modelled off real cities.

One thing I like is there is a distinct style as well, they don't try to do everything; horses are the primary mount, very little fast travel; so mounts are actually useful, and no true flying mounts either just gliding. 
The amount of crazy MMO stuff isn't outrageous either, no crazy mounts; flying cars/robots/giraffe monstrosities or ridiculous outfits like final fantasy/Tera. just some usual mmo suspects, battle lingerie being the main culprit, which i'm not opposed to ;)

BDO is one of those games either you love it or hate it, or its a bit of both and you are waiting for a new mmo that never arrives...",1671802921,1697866517,True,382,13,0.940447092056274414,0,True,False,False

It has a beautiful combat system that can't be denied, if you like action you'll love this combat style. 
The story is wholesome and while you'll probably drift off of it a few times, you'll complete it several times during the course of your time when levelling alts etc. There is a special quality when it comes to the sound design and art style, I'm not even a huge anime fan but that traditional and subtle implementation of that artistic flavor is relaxing and delightful.

The lifeskills are even quite enjoyable I'm nearly a Guru fisherman which comes with its own perks and I frankly cannot keep the ladies off me.

- Insanely fun combat. Never gets old.
- All the classes I've tried so far are insane in their own way.
- Game gives tons of free stuff (outfits, buffs, high tier mounts).
- While it is VERY monetized, due to the free stuff, I never feel forced to buy anything.
- Life skills are very fleshed out.
- The character design/customization is wonderfully degenerate.

Dislikes:
- What even is the UI. You have to completely redo it yourself if you don't want your screen to look like alphabet soup.
- Menus are pretty unorganized. Sometimes I feel like half my time spent in the game is just sifting through menus.
- Although I don't feel the NEED to buy anything, the game definitely tries to shove the Shop down your throat.

Let me say that i invested some money into the game to see for myself the difference it makes, i understand devs needs to make money somehow but this beyond acceptable, some of the p2w aspects are:

- You get a tent wich gives you a dmg  or lifeskill buff + increased drop rate + repair where you want + a bit of extra inventory space, the tent is huge no matter if you're a mob grinder or lifeskill character (those who make stuff and sell on the market).

- You get enough pets to upgrade all of them to T4 wich in some places doubles your item pickup rate, i tried playing with T1 pets (free ones) and the difference is massive.

- Some pets give lifeskill bonuses like the hedgedog, at T4 that's 50% chance to get double loot from gathering lifeskill, it's broken.

- You can't sell without a valuepack unless you want to get 30% less money, you can buy this item for loyalty points but only about twice per month, this means that you can't sell in the market everyday wich sucks bad if you're a trader since some items have amount cap for selling, for example i make accesories and cant place a buy order bigger than 10 at a time and cant renew my order often since i dont have the valuepack.

- If you decide to whale there's smart whaling wich is insanely profitable (wont mention how to prevent promoting it) and dumb whaling wich is buying stuff from the cash shop and selling it on the market.

- Aside from all this you can directly buy from the cash shop a large amount of items wich might be expensive but doesn't mean it's not p2w.

This is simply unnaceptable, it got the pay once for convinience like PoE wich would be reasonable to a point but on top the game keeps giving you reasons to invest regularly giving a obvios advantage.

Putting all the p2w aside the game is pure grind but has that sense of progression wich keeps you hooked, the main goal would be to make pvp when your gear is good enough but i can already see problems with pvp due to the game design, wont go into full detail but these are: 

1 - Too much damage, from what i've seen 1 cc = 1 kill.
2 - Every skill has super armor (immune to most cc)
3 - Flashy skill spamming all day until you get lucky gameplay, this is due to low skill cooldowns.
4 - Game speed is too fast to react and skills are hard to identify in that short time all gets even worse thanks to effect spam, in consequence people usually just try to guess the opponent next move at best or just spam their rotation.",1697681349,1697681349,False,0,0,0.470929443836212158,0,True,False,False

The game itself played huge role in MMO scene by taking every possible aspect to another level.
Gameplay is smooth and enjoyable. Combat is fast, challenging and there's a lot to learn about timing and unleashing full potential of your character. Talking about chars we got plenty of those- every single one different and fun to play. As for the world- it is huge, well designed and filled with cosmic amount of possible interactions. I won't talk about graphics, it's something to be experienced personally to trully enjoy such creation.

The most valuable thing is definitely type of gameplay you can choose to participate in. You can either grind, gear up and train yourself at combat or stay calm and enjoy preparing things, selling them and trading for fair cash. You choose your path, your approach to the game and there's nothing standing in your way to achieve certain goals.

As much as people complain about amount of grinding required to achieve something and kinda bad management of Item shop I still think it's for now one of the best titles from MMO category.
Remember the fact that BDO is purely korean game which makes it more grindy. Once again it's not something to be worrying about since at the end of the day only the amount of fun you gained matters.",1571957619,1697417564,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

This game had a pretty good main story for an MMO, yes ''had'' because especially after half of the main questline it becomes unnecessarily complicated and it becomes kind of a big pile of text throwing your way.


[h1] LETS DO THIS! LEROOOOOY JENKINS! [/h1]
This game takes you a lot of time from your life and in return, it gives you big freedom. We have quests and they can easily help you to reach the highest levels but you are free, you can just kill monsters to level up or level up with lifeskilling. You can fight with world BOSS'es every day, they have their own schedule so you can know the exact position and hour they will appear. You can make PVP, fight in little matches or you can join a clan and fight in Clan Wars. You can do trade business. You can become a farmer. You can become a chemist. Wanna chill a little bit? Crate lower-level characters, jump your ship, and go fishing. You wanna do a different thing than a normal MMO burden? But not just chilling, do you want to do some adventurous things as well? Take your high-level character, go fishing, and face lots of PVP players who use highly weaponized ships. Or maybe you want to produce your own horses? Then go hunt wild horses and mate them for new amazing horses. And if you do right all of these things going to give you a lot of in-game money. So while losing lots of time and doing interesting things; you can gain money and use this freedom. But yeah after some time even these things became boring like other MMOs.


[h1] WAIT WAIT WAIT... WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS GAME HAS THE BEST MMO COMBAT?! [/h1]
That's not even questionable... This game has the best MMO action combat. It's literally dominating all MMOs with action combat out there with how well action combat is. And weirdly enough even in 2023 no game has managed to top this action combat, which is a shame, I would love to see that kind of game.


[h1] SKILL TREE AND CLASSES [/h1]
First of all, creating characters in this game is pretty neat. You have lots of amazing options and you can create literally whatever you want. As for classes we have 26 different classes and we are getting new classes every year. Their skill trees are well-made as well with a lot of meaningful and unique skills.


[h1] BIG QUESTION, IS THIS GAME PAY TO WIN?[/h1]
I can't say it's fully P2W and probably the only real P2W thing is the P2W Tent you buy from Pearl Market, but aside from that there is no P2W stuff, but... The game is very harsh, it takes too much time to get things people can get easily with real money. People can buy pearl items with real money, and then sell them on the game market, while these items help F2P players (Like buying Value Packs or Costumes without paying zero bucks and with in-game money) same time it hurts them. Costumes sell for around 1-1.5b and depending on your family's fame you can sell up to 5-35 costumes every week, so that means without spending any hour ingame you can earn around 35-50b in-game money every week and that's equivalent average grinder 35-65 hour of grinding and it's too much... This game gives you very little reward for actually playing and it's harsh, and weirdly enough it wasn't always like this, but with the latest updates increasing cron, memory fragment, and pearl items you sell on the in-game market by 97% and things became quite bad, and timing was quite bad as well, these updates all happened after BDO gained popularity because of some known YouTubers making videos by saying ''BDO is not P2W anymore!'' I guess PA took those comments personally and wanted to prove them they are wrong...


[h1] HOW ABOUT OUR OPEN WORLD? HOW BIG AND WELL MADE? [/h1]
Honestly, it's quite big. We have lots of cities, enemy territories you can grind, lots of islands you can explore, etc... It's not big enough like ESO or WOW (if I'm not wrong) but still it's not a game with a little or middle open world. This game has a pretty big open world to explore.


[h1] WHAT IS THIS SEASON THING? [/h1]
Season basically gives you access to the season server, free special season gears, a lot of good rewards, and some pearl rewards, outfits, etc. It's one of the most new player-friendly things I have seen in any MMO and helps players a lot to get decent gear and stuff.


[h1] HOW ABOUT GRAPHIC QUALITY? [/h1]
I'm not sure if it's best or not but this game's graphic quality looks damn fine! It's one of the most amazing MMO graphic quality you can see and the designs are pretty good as well. World design, house materials, BOSS and enemy details, NPC's, etc... All of them look amazing.


[h1] OUTCOME EVALUATION [/h1]
In the end, this is a pretty good MMO game, it has some problems and PA seems taking things in a worse direction than a couple of months ago, but it's still a pretty good game and has the best MMO action combat. So if you are an MMO lover you should definitely play/try BDO. I'm pretty sure you are going to like it. It's not perfect and after some time it can be quite boring but it still gives you lots of content as MMO and until doing them for a long time they are pretty enjoyable as well.

Since PA took over the publishing the game has become less and less ""pay to win"". It is still very sketchy as far as ""pay for convenience"" goes... The only really way to enhance your gear is to spend money, not everything is available in game that is in the store... 

My biggest gripe with BDO (Black Desert Online) is the enhancement system. It is terribly hard to enhance and its a science of RNG that you have to be in it for the ""Long haul"" in order to enhance things (especially accessories which make up most of your gear). Accessories if you fail at any stage of enhancement ""blow up"" and if you use the convenience feature of ""Cron Stones"" there is a chance of it downgrading instead of blowing up entirely. In short, if RNG is not in your favor you could loose 400 hours of grinding time in the in game currency ""Silver"" for it downgrading, or even more if you do not use the protection Cron Stone's and the entire thing blows up... 

Everything is tied to the cash shop though, from marketplace discount so you can actually sell things you find by grinding to your energy recovery by another item to being able to change your skills... with yet another item bought for real life money... 


The long and short, its getting better but they need to pick what they want to charge people for and not have so many different things they charge for... To run the game efficiently then expect to spend at bare minimum 100 USD a month... Fun game? Yes.... Expensive and worth it?

However, I personally found this game to be a lot of fun. The world itself is pretty huge and you could easily spend hours wandering around finding all the cities and collecting all the plants and items found out in the wild. The life skills is pretty extensive to the point where I find it overwhelming. The combat itself is pretty simple at first, but once you start to level up and get new moves, you can easily stack them. I also find it cool that certain moves can only be triggered in succession to others. Graphically, I found it quite beautiful, especially the player models themselves, which you can very extensively customize. The environments are gorgeous and vary in look. There is always something to do. You can even go sailing in this game, which I find fun to do, especially with how pretty the water and far out islands can look.
My biggest gripes with the game are the fact that, in my personal experience, it is easy to get stuck on some on the 3rd models in the environment. Since the world is so big, sometimes going off the paths cuts down transportation time, which takes forever if you haven't completed the Magnus questline. There is no fast travel in the game until you do so, unless you want to wait 20 minutes. The same goes for the cities themselves which are a pain to navigate with all the connecting paths that also lead to dead ends, making transportation even longer. I have to rely very heavily on the auto-navigate feature. I'm also not fond of the double layered in-game currency bought with real money. In order to buy one currency, you have to buy another. When you add this up, it can cost $30 to buy an outfit. Now, of course, this is only cosmetics and I completely understand that Pearl Abyss needs this money to keep the game up along with their company. They also do hand out outfit boxes for events, usually around holidays, but they're not often. Again, this is just one of my pets peeves. It's really not that big of a deal, especially considering buying the game upfront is only $10. And for only $10, you get a lot.
I apologize for this lengthy review, but I had a lot to say. I sounded negative at the end, but those are only minor inconveniences and don't take away the overall experience which is really fun.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

What I don't like tho is that if you are a Shai you basically get bullied by the company AND the players ingame. You can't open the free Outfit boxes because Shai doesn't get the option to begin with OR it's the same old outfit most of the players already have. You miss out on Gearscore AND passives in endgame content because you have a different Awakening Weapon which you also can't buy, so you have to enhance it yourself?? You basically have to suffer through gambling to fill 70% of the gap between you and every other class. There is people online that specifically hunt you and kill you because you play Shai and you can't really do anything about it because Shai isn't balanced enough in PVP to keep up with any PVP opponent.
What makes me the most furious is that they inconvenience Shai in everything except some specific lifeskills, but still use this class EVERYWHERE for advertisement. Don't get me wrong, I love Shai, look at my playtime, it's all been on Shai! I just wish it would matter less on which class you pick to play.

You will have some epic battle with the best combat system i have ever seen in an MMO. All of the classes a amazing, and you will mow through dozens of enemies at a time. AAAAAAAANNNNNDDDD thats it.
This MMO has the absolute WORST end game. Everything will take you month of constant play time before you can even do entry level things. 
Forget PVP, it is required to spend several hundred hours gearing up to even start, and to have a good chance your looking at thousands of hours. The crafting system is designed to make you furious because of its designed to eat matts. Everything is a tiome sink and all of the fun combat disabears once the MSQ ends. \

Heres an example. I finished the MSQ and discovered there was an entire ship mechanic to try out. Cool! time to be a pirate. Went out found the free ship and was excited. Now its a free ship so i didn't expect much. Probably able to do a little bit of everything but bad at all of it right? Nope. Try, incapable of doing anything but move slowly. But, you can upgrade it. Sweet! NOPE, after doing the math it would take me  months of choping trees for 8 hours a day to get the firtst upgrade...and there are multiple. Ok so ill buy the wood.....the trading bords are dead. Fuck.

Got another V me happy XD
15k hours since last review still Good game!
We all miss Kakao!

Update after 40k hours:
If your a new player looking for a mmo with open world pvp dont spend time on this game. Since they removed almost all open world pvp that was in the game. 
Like pve and roleplay? then its 100% for you.
If you want open world pvp dont ever think about this game as it have removed most of its content.
PA has messed up this game so badly after the split of kakao its hardly the same. ohh and the crybaby wow players came to this game and messed it up here also after they killed wow.
They dont want pvp in the game so they have been going slowly that way for a long time, and now its hit us with all the pvp changes. 
Made family karma so if you kill a player you get punished on all 30 charrs, killed guild wars you cant declare war on anyone anymore unless its pre arranged and so much more.
Even node wars have been messed up so badly that more quit the game since thats kinda only real pvp you get with your guild in this game now.
The game punishes pvp players as hard they can. Mess it up alot more and im also done.

Pros:
1) Combat - There are so many classes with different playstyles, so chances are that there's something for everyone.
2) Lots to do - As with any MMO, there are years and years worth of content to chew through, so in theory everyone can find something to do. Starting with typical PVP and PVE and ending with farming , sailing, hunting, fishing, often with their own minigames.
3) Lots of chase items - There are a ton of (QoL) items that take months or even years to work towards if you feel like you are bored with nothing to do.
4) Gearing is vertical at first, but becomes horizontal after a certain point. You can quit for 2 years and still be near the same power level as before.

Cons:
1) New player experience is horrific, it almost beats Destiny 2 and Warframe on the level of confusion.
* UI is messy and won't make any sense for the first few days.
* You will be showered with 150 different items that you won't know what to do anything with, which is especially bad because inventory size is super limited at first.

2) Questing is a whole another topic and probably needs an overhaul with the permanent seasonal server update. 
*Questing is somehow split between the questing window (Keybind O), actual NPC's and your personal annoying little black cockroach that loves to give you quests as well. 
*To make things worse, you are often unable to claim questing rewards unless you talk to the NPC's again for no apparent reason, so every quest that has rewards has you effectively spam ESC to get out of the conversation just so you could start talking to them again to claim the rewards.

Neutral/Controversial:
1) There are more and more updates that favor PVE over PVP. 
PVE: More activities, bosses and dungeons are added, ""Marni*, a ""safe realm"" can be used for half a day which allows you to dodge any PVPers should any still exist in this game.
PVP: One sided non consequential PVP was basically removed and/or is heavily punished.
2) This game has no monthly subscription, so you can expect microtransactions to be shoved in your face, sometimes rather aggressively.

And the depth is quite fascinating, you could spend thousands of hours and still have a bunch of things to learn. There's life skills like gathering, fishing, hunting, trading and many more which gives you an alternative path instead of going the ""classic"" monster farming route. Another great factor is that you get to explore a really huge map with differnet territories going by foot, horse, wagon, balloon or even boat.

When you first start to play the game you get overwhelmed by information, it can be hard to play a game when there's so much to learn. That said, if you do enjoy the basic mechanics and have the patience I do recommend to stay around, else it might not be for you.

If you are buying this game, patience is key and take time to learn the basics. Be prepared to spam the ""R"" button if you don't enjoy the quest dialogues, most quests in my opinion aren't that great (however there are many good questlines as well). Another thing to be prepared for is late game gear enhancing, which will be really time consuming. By the time you reach this point however you will already have several hundred hours.

Then spent about 100 hours playing to try and see what I like most. I was starting to enjoy playing with my partner, but that was pretty much the best part of it. I bought some packs and accessories to see if that would make for a better experience, I played another 100 hours hoping it would be less of a grind and had more interesting things to do. I finally called it quits after not really having the fun I wanted to have, or the social experience, It just was not a well rounded game. 

Years later I found out by others that the game has been ""greatly improved"" and there are more ""free items"" now. When I go to download it once again I find that all the money I spent in game for gear is gone, my account is lost forever. This was due to the updates they were doing to the game. Everyone was to transfer their account before 2021. Apparently this was supposed to be my responsibility. I find that really annoying. Then when I go see what new things are available, I see that there are 3 DLCs one for nearly 80$, one for 50$ and one for 30$. For real?

The OST was brilliant and fitting in almost every situation, and the classes give you plenty to chose from so that there is one fit for you. There are a few perchases to make the game more convenient late game, but nothing 100% needed. 

Im in love with the world and the freedom with solo play. But one saddening thing is that it is is so darn hard to LFG. So if you can get some friends together and make a guild to play regularly that would be the most ideal situation possible. 

Now be careful, one thing I don’t like is how cosmetics are BOUND to the character you put them on the first time. So make sure at least for 10 hours of playing that character that that is the one. I have made a few purchases for cosmetics early on thinking I could just switch them over not reading (assuming it was like most games) that I could just move over the cosmetics to a new character of the same class, but no dice.

 Now another ick I have is that early on, there is too much running and talking, and later on there is like none. Now I just think it should be spread out a little more  as people early game can get bored very easily if they don’t see the results fast enough since they are not fighting, and late game can leave thinking they have done it all after awakening. The game is much larger than that, but it doesn’t say it explicitly.

Now, some RECOMMENDATIONS.
     If you are a lore junkie with and want to know everything anyone in the game says, start with the first spawn point, the one recommended for novices, you start of nice and slow. Also you get the beginning intros and all that junk. 

Now if you want to rush levels and skip 200 years of just reading and listening to people, go to the second spawn point, I think it has the fastest leveling through story and the least amount of talking (<3 lando) . 

Now if you want that nice city feel with the beautiful landscape and pretty women and Japanese feel (any weeb/otaku or person who picks ninja/kunoichi class) the third spawn point is your pick. It’s a little slower, but you get all that beauty you want in a realistic game. 

Now weapon crafting is something I am still looking into, I’m not a pro or anything, so bear with my personal opinions please.
 
Now, Classes

Not too much I can say about this, as I have not tried all of them yet, but excitement with them all, as they all have a different feel. You may despise how it feels to play one character type and then love the next. There is no one class fits all, like most games where you have “warrior,mage, and tank” (example please don’t get angry) so don’t give up on the game just because you picked an unfitting class to you. It’s like food with seasoning. You are eating the same food, but one seasoning may make you lose your appetite, and another will
Make you eat it faster than I can say “Black desert.” 

Overall I love the game, and even with how I worded this, I still have MUCH to learn about the game and plan to play it much much more. 
Hope this helped!

I didnt want to believe it so I held off trying for two years.   I wanted to dislike the game and just say it wasnt good enough to replace TERA in my game catalog...  HOWEVER...

Black Desert is definitely the game I was looking for. I like the action style. The graphics are amazing. The economic and trade model is fantastic.  Initial game play story line is really in depth storytelling. I can't say enough about the character customization options. The introduction of season servers, really helps new players learn the game with their first character or two and get the feel of the world.  I am a huge fan...

This game is like crack! It is addictive and life consuming. If you have BDO installed on your computer you no longer have time for anything else. It is a marathon and one hell of a grind but man is it fun! 

There is so much depth to this game that you'll need to spend a large amount of time outside of the game researching and looking at guides. 

Pros: 
Immersive
Vast depth of game mechanics / features / skills / options / classes / just loads of variety in general! 
Best combat in the genre easily
No subscription and low buy in cost, I'd like to thank the whales for funding the developers and allowing us F2P players remain F2P
New(ish) seasonal servers allow new players to catch up and get into the mid game easily
Graphics
Universe design
PvP

Cons:
Cash shop is very expensive
There's a cash shop
Game is EXTREMELY grindy (but if you like games like Runescape this is more of a pro for you then a con)
Quests / mechanics / features / etc are often not explained well and you'll need to do research outside of the game
Story telling mostly sucks, it's getting better but meh, spam that R key

In summary I recommend anyone try this game, there's little to risk as the game is only $13 and often on sale for half of that. There is thousands of hours of gameplay on offer. For the sweaty grinders there's tens of thousands of hours. If you've heard the game is pay 2 win that's mostly untrue, although possible the conversion rate of real money to in game silver is simply not worth it to all but the fattest of whales. The best way to sum up BDO is majority of the content is similar to a MARATHON and NOT a SPRINT! To be competitive you will need to invest thousands of hours but if you don't want to be competitive the game still has plenty of things to do for the casual player.

There is an incredibly long list of things PA has done to decrease monetization over the years while adding [u]nothing[/u] to increase it. They literally power crept their ""P2W"" store. Grinding beats swiping because of constant inflation, which is good and needed for the economy.
And yet you see in every review how PA is ""Arbitrarily inconveniencing the players."" Or it's a ""Money sink, where you have to pay for everything."" Or it's just ""P2W"". But these reviewers wouldn't know this because they didn't play the game.
Watch the ""700 GS in 60 days"" series, its eye opening. 

You can't even win in this game in a traditional sense since PVP isn't a significant part of it unless you join a guild specifically for wars, or maybe you like the absolute mayhem of Red Battlefield. The bad thing about these game modes is that even if the gear was capped, it would still be a blender simulator with no precision or way to improve your PVP skills.
The much more fun game mode is Arena of Solar. It's equal gear and 3v3, so you can improve your 1v1 skills. 

It's hard to find negative things about the game these days. I highly recommend EvilDoUsHarm on YouTube, Garmoth.com, and bdocodex.com. Also, complete all the main quest lines and the important adventure journals. It will solve a lot of headaches.

I will tell you why.

there is a File in the game Files "" XignCode"" and it's a Anti-Hack, Anti-maleware, Anti-Virus File but what it does is it Searches through ALL your files on your computer to search for anything that can hack the game but You can only remove it if you delete the Game and Delete all the files Related to Black Desert Online. XignCode might give Viruses and other Malware Destruction to your Computer. I have played it to test it out and when I found out about this I Talked to the Creator of Black Desert and he said That They will not remove it until more people say to eventhough there is a whole Community against XignCode. So if you Want a company to look through ALL your Files on your Computer and maybe get hacked Then this is the game for you. I tried everything I know about deleting files Forever. They Add New users on your Computer to forbid you to access Certain BDO Files Like Xigncode and all that. 

UPDATE: So i ended up having to system Restore my PC to remove the users this game has added onto my PC. The user they add is labeled ' ADMINISTRATOR ' which I only had 1 which was me. I finally was able to remove it and now able to access my computers Docs. keep in mind if you get this, the ONLY way I found to remove their user is to system restore everything.

I run around and NPCs almost require me touching them to load in properly and players seem to jump across space and time. The player character model is amazing and environmental detail is gorgeous but I can't feel invested in a world where black shadows replace NPCs at a distance or the game just pops them in when you're super close. I spent a good few hours trying to fix that issue but it's persistant. 

If you do get into this game, do yourself a favor and turn off notifications on other player activities. This game (by default) was letting me know when anyone was crafting (and failing.) Basically another player can crack wind and the game will notify you. I suggest saving your sanity on that one.

As for clothing customization... there is none. Everything worth having is locked behind a paywal, including your choice of underwear (When in your home) or Underwear and some thigh-highs for an equal price. The default outfit of the sorceress is super cool but I could only find subtle gear changes which made it feel like the game very uninspired. 

I really love the combat of the sorceress and this is literally the first game ever that has a character with my facial markings and a combat style I love. As well as a subtle detail that made my artist heart gush was the detailing of the models. My character blasting dark balls of energy actually looked like my character had to tense her muscles to launch the next ball of dark energy.

I'm looking forward to trying the rest. I enjoyed playing solo for a while but then got invited to a guild and I gotta say the guildmates are pretty chill to hang with.

My only complaints are:

1. I was not enjoying the story and was mostly just skipping through dialogues.
2. The tutorial does not do a good job explaining the important parts of the game such as gearing. I had to figure that out myself using the internet and my guildmates.

Would I recommend BDO?

And the movement is awful. Everything else in this game is infected with Korean MMO systems. Not only that but the game feels cheap, tacky and shallow. There's no substance to the game at all. And I don't even know why they would turn this into an MMO. As a single player game, it's actually pretty great (minus the energy system).

 - The energy system is awful and it's awful in every single game that implements it. There's people defending it, and it's because they're delusional if they think it's an acceptable system. Gating gathering behind an energy system has to be the most ridiculous system in an MMO. The effort gathering is what should be worth the silver selling it, not energy. It basically cheapens your efforts to the point that it makes you believe your effort is not important. It's the energy system. What a joke.

- No player trading. Probably the most ridiculous restriction in this game. There's already little incentive to group up. But grinding for specific items with other people is completely pointless. And so is grinding with someone.

- North Korea marketplace. You basically have no say what to sell the items you spend your time and effort crafting. None. Like the Epheria Sailboat. At the time of this review you can only sell the tfor 530 mil silver. 530 mil silver is nothing. For 20 days of dailies, plus the amount of time it takes to construct. A ridiculous amount of time gathering logs (which you can only gather physically) which guess what? You can't even gather because there's an energy system preventing you form doing so!

- Player driven economy is a lie. There is no player driven economy. The marketplace is a joke. Nothing is for sale. And you get hit with a 35% sales fee to remove ANY incentive for margin trading.

- Enchanting system. Of course it's a Korean MMO. There's going to be an enchanting system. They are all awful RNG gambling money sinks.

Summary: This game is basically an abusive relationship and you're a drug addict that is delusional and thinks this game is somehow fun. This game should be sued for false advertising for claiming it's a multiplayer game. It's not. It's a Massively Online Role Playing Game. There is no multiplayer. Except GvG PvP.

Like massacring whole armies of goblins and orcs and various creatures, taking out their outposts or supplies, ect ect. The cute shadow you wake up with becomes more and more ominous and it really fleshes out the story to see him grow and change. The world is a bit detailed, like training your horse/donkey to level them up. Same with your animal companions that you have to keep fed and well. Nothing too difficult but still an immersive feature that some people may find bothersome. lots of different things you can do may get confusing but you can always find guides online and its really not to difficult once you learn. The outfits are super cute and you can change their colors and customize your character.

I had around 150 days in-game time (semi-afk), most of time I did lifeskills and then switched to PvE. Game turned into toxic experience every now and then. 
E.g. within an hour of grinding comes a player forcing you ""dfs"", you decline and become a target for a grief or go looking for another server/spot. Then they manage to bomb your karma and if after each death with negative karma you lose crystals, lightstones or even grade of your items.

The old problems that plagued this game years ago still rear their ugly heads, albeit further down the line of progression than the days old. Whether your enjoyment comes from PVE content or PVP content, there is on single truth in the world of BDO: Grinding, like taxes, is inevitable and perpetual. There will never come a point where you will simply have the ""best"" gear. The hard caps are so unreachable, so unattainable, that they are simply out of reach for normal contributing members of society, and just barely in reach for those that make this game their life. 

No one plays MMOs for their story so lets jump towards what players are working for: PVP. To be fair though, the devs have added a lot of content for endgame PVE over the years, but it isnt enough to fully enjoy once you near the top rung of that ladder. PVP really still is the only thing endgame players strive for, and it honestly isnt all that amazing. BDO is widely touted as having the most skill based and in depth combat system on the market, but in most pvp situations whoever gets the first knockdown will win 99% of the time regardless of skill. That is in a fair fight, which for most of your BDO playtime you will be at a disadvantage. A characters strength is determined by gear score, which is increased by attaining better gear. The problem is this gear becomes so hard to get that you'll eventually spend weeks, and eventually months just to get a few point increase. The reason its so hard to get is due to the chance based enchantment system in the game. It starts off with reasonable rates like 50% but can get as low as 0.001% chance. Yes there are systems in place to increase that % chance, but only slightly. A 5% chance at successfully enhancing an endgame piece of gear is considered mind-blowingly amazing, and each attempt will run you several hours of grinding just to be able to take another chance at the wheel so to speak. You'll spend this time getting bullied by higher gear score (GS) people, dreaming of the day where you get to hand their abuse back to them. Then, one day you'll become somewhat strong. You'll finally be able to defend your grindspots from being taken by higher GS assholes, only to realize there isnt any death penalty. then comes little tuvala timmy gearlet bombing your rotation goading you into attacking him... but you cant, because of the karma system. You see, even though you're stronger than little timmy here, the karma system protects him as he refuses to leave your rotation. Openworld PVP was designed so you can remove this little gearlet because you've invested more time into the game, except you cant otherwise you'll go red, get ganked by his friends, and lose billions just trying to defend your rotation.

It's an action combat game with deep life skilling, and a very large progression ramp.  You can PvP, or AFK fish, or buy Mansions, or engage in Sea Combat with NPC monsters or other players.  The items in the game are traded between with a central market, so there's a whole economy, and effort based progression system.

So now i'm stuck on a regular server doing everything in my power to progress with no hope. Furthermore, let's not talk about the price for this game. Yes, the game is ONLY 7$, however, if you want to progress without it being tedious there is an additional price tag of 60$ you MUST spend. Yeah.. yeah .. yeah. you don't have too, but if you don't, everything take longer to do. I only recommend this game if you  have nothing else to play.


P.S. If you're looking for a game to play with friends, this is not the right game to play. I came on playing with my friend, but most of time we can't do anything together because they penalize you with XP, money, and anything else you can think of. 


*All the guides on YouTube are useless and to long to watch. It's better to just play and figure it out yourself. This game used to be worse with all the grinding and monetization and all they did after the getting the company back is give you free stuff which at the end of the day isn't that great. They give you a little to bait you into spending more money. 


A game is supposed to be a game not a chore. I understand you should set goals for yourself, but who sets month long goals for a fucking VIDEO GAME. IT'S A FUCKING VIDEO GAME A FUCKING VIDEO GAME. Once again, this is a VIDEO GAME which wants you to play solo with an MMO tag???? OH Jesus, I just don't understand. Do not get baited the 7$ price tag and just move on.

With just gender locking classes it ruins the game for me. if i want to make a male Dark Knight I cant. If I wanted to make a female Ninja I can't don't know whats the point of gender locking them also there's not a lot of choices to customize the already gender locked character. All other MMORPG's give so much freedom with character customization and letting players choose the gender of their Character is a BIG IMPORTANT option to include in your game. I don't know if its laziness. I doubt it on how beautiful the game is and the fighting is pretty good. I bought the game with the thought that I had freedom on how I could create my character but I was wrong. Maybe the game is not for me but.

It looks pretty, the world it builds feels huge and has many different systems to learn and interact with, the sandbox nature let's you set your own goals and it has, by far, the most fun combat I've played in an MMO yet.

Unfortunately the game has too many other bad things going for it to ignore. The PvE is fundamentally the same whether you're level 10 or level 60. You run around grinding mobs, forever. There are some world bosses, but they didn't seem very special to me. Their hard versions have some fun mechanics, but they would be considered middle of the road in other games. There are a grand total of 3 dungeons, which I didn't even get to do as they seem quite unpopular.

Life skilling can be an enjoyable break from the action, but can involve significant amounts of afk activity. You are expected to keep the game running forever while your character fishes or cooks 3000 dishes in a row.

The game flatout has annoying popups that I'd expect in shady sites that lead you to malware. I'll get annoyed every day and match in Arena with a stupid ass popup I have to cancel every single day. Everything is monetized and the game wants you to know it. The game is infamous as both a no lifer grinder and P2W fiasco and in my opinion it's absolutely true.

I could deal with all of those things but what really did it for me is the PvP. Open world you will get literally 1 tapped by no lifers, so your fun might vary significantly. Most of the guys actually running around in confidence looking for fights know they have the gear to back it up. But even if you find an equally geared opponent there are other problems with the combat.

There is something else that annoys me the most about PvP. The real issue is that the combat is good, and it has depth, but either the engine or their servers fundamentally can't handle the fast pace of the action. Characters will desync and you'll get grabbed from 20 feet away, or your super armor won't work and you'll get stunned through no fault of your own. On top of that, there are stats that can make it so enemies will randomly resist a cc attempt or autododge attacks.

I cannot comprehend how a game with so much PvP in its life can actually have so many horrible things that ruin the PvP on a foundational level. If it actually worked, it would probably be one of, if not the, best MMO PvP there is. Instead, I found myself longing to go back to tab targetters. At least there the CC I applied actually does its job.",1694048603,1694048603,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After about 3k+ hours (it used to have another launcher for Black Desert SA, so it does not show my correct game time) I just don't wanna play this game anymore, every day that I log in I feel like a fool, out of the 3k hours i'd say I only played about 1k hours the other 2k are just afk fishing, afk alchemy, and afk cooking. 

TL DR: So what is this game actually about? AFK activities, RNG, micro-transactions, gambling, gambling, gambling. Oh! And more gambling. There is nothing here beyond that.

Sure the combat is the best in any action MMORPG but is it really worth your time? Every aspect of the game is plagued with low chance RNGs and gambling. After a certain point in the game (just after you graduate from season) your progress as a new player halts almost to a stop, then you have realistically 2 choices:

RNG enhancement:
For RNG enhancement, lets just say that during season they make it feel like its easy, but let me show you the real deal: The base chance for a successful upgrade from a Blackstar TET to PEN is 0,2%, sure black star PEN is the best weapon in the game, are you mortal human, some day gonna have one? No. But how much does it cost anyway? About 150 billion silver, which I can't even put it in terms of grind hours cause I've never even got past 30 billion silver without tearing my hair out and shoving a dick up my ass, its one of those things that it is better to not even know. 

Okay so lets bring this to post season characters, Base chance for a boss armor TET to PEN: 0.3%. Oh yeah but I forgot to mention the difference between clicking a BS PEN and a Boss Armor PEN, do you know what happens when you fail an enhance? downgrade, what prevents a downgrade? Cron stones, how much does it cost for 1 cron stone, 2 million silver (3m depending on your region, yeah they fuck your ass differently depending from where you are playing the game), how many cron do you need for ONE safe click? Blackstar TET to PEN: 3.6k cron stones. Boss Armour TET to PEN: about 1k - 2k cron, do the math and see how much it costs just for one attempt at enhancing. 
But here is the catch, my account is 8 years old so I have at least 3 to 30 of every type of Valks Advice possible (its an item that enhances your chance for a successful upgrade) If I have the Cron, I can click what ever the fuck I want, but you dear newbie, you are fucked, you get a handful and that's it, login again tomorrow or for 3 days strait to get another one, or go spend your money building up fails stacks. 

But hey!!! Here is a random event box full of goodies that has 99.5% chance of giving you 10 - 20 Cron stones that you can't even sell back to the NPC for extra money.

Grind:
For buying a gear upgrade you are looking at least 10 hours+ of grinding, when you finish season, for your next upgrade, you need about 5 billion silver which is one boss armor at PEN, then do that another 5 times and congrats!!! You have just entered early-mid game and can now actually play the game (don't try PVP though, you won't understand shit about what you are doing and the opponent will just teleport around your screen and 1 hit kill you, maybe try Solare Arena if you don't mind getting flaked for being newbie). In the Gear Score Bracket I am I'd say its about 100+ hours of grinding for one measly upgrade, something like +2 of AP (assuming I grind sweaty with high APM).

What about the Jettina dailies for a PEN accessory? 
Yeah good luck to you on logging in every day for 2 months strait and killing 3k mobs every day, I did it, was not fun, it TOOK ME A FUCKING YEAR TO FINISH IT. 

BUT WAIT, THERE IS MORE!! You want a PEN boss armor? Well, for your first weapon and armor we have a really good promotion its just half the price plus 2 - 3 weeks of dailies!!!! oh what? you want another? its double the original price of the item in the market plus 2 - 3 weeks of dailies, what a great system we made that helps newbies!!!!!

Magnus questline? Ok you can have a PEN boss gear for free! do you know what you need to do? Just do this quest-line that takes up a hole day to finish and the only thing you do is trash and buggy minigames, YAY!!! (Pick the PEN Urugon Boots, you will thank me later)

""Oh but you don't need to touch RNG in this game, you can buy everything"" incorrect, for gear that maybe the case, but for everything else you are forced in to the game's RNG. Every event nowadays is just some RNG box with the slimiest possibility to get something actually good. 

Let me illustrate: There was an event where you put your worker to gather some goodies sacks and after 6 - 8 hours (depending on your worker) you had a chance to get 1 of the 3 types of sacks (2 of them complete shit, 1 good), I left my worker the entire event (about 2 weeks of event), let me tell you how many I got: About 40+ sacks of shit and 6 sacks with the POSSIBILITY of good items. After the event ended I opened them all, wanna know what I got? Shits and turds. 

Oh did I mention your worker only works when you are online? so do the math 46 bags multiplied by 6 hours for each bag = 276 hours, 276 hours divided by 24 = 11.5 days online out of 14 days, yeah I could have mined bitcoin and injected the money in the game and I would have had more ROI.

Next event: stay online for about 2 hours a day and open 2 - 3 box of possible goodies, I have opened about 12 boxes, wanna know what I got? ANOTHER RNG BOX! And again more shits and turds, what will I get till the end of the event? Probably more shits and turds and maybe, but just maybe ANOTHER RNG BOX!!!!
And that just goes on for every ""event"", until you actually manage to drop something good and go ""wow! this event is really good, PA is such a good developer, giving cash items for free, I love them!!"".

So what am I trying to say? That I have Bad RNG? No its not that, its that just the game likes to make a fool out of you, they are going to put RNG box inside of another RNG box in everything and shove it down your throat, and you know what the problem is with gambling? The house almost always wins.... 

Here in BDO they use every possible tactic in psychology books, to get you hooked, to give you the illusion of progression, to make you spend money, but when you stop for a second and think on what they are doing and how you are responding to it, you are either gonna feel like a fool, or a guinea pig.

And you know what part is worst? Its that the community loves being made a fool of by the devs, they are going to defend PA with teeth, tooth and nails, its like some kind of Stockholm effect. They are going to say ""no man this game was a lot worse, PA devs have listened and made things better for players"" yeah... they actually haven't, sure they made some things less atrocious, but then again its that same tactic where you create a problem and give the solution, thing is the solution is 99% in favor of the devs and 1% in your favor, but the way they do it and communicate it, it always feels like they are doing this for you, for your better game experience, to help you out. But its not, its just to inflate steam-charts with active users and make you spend more money. 

""Oh boy they gave me a J's hammer now I have 1 FREE try to get that Black Star TET to PEN with 5% chance!!!!!!""

""Hey! here is a free legendary T9 horse!!! Good for you, we are such good devs, now go and click it to T10, here is a shit ton materials for you to try to click it! Oh it din't go T10? To bad, stay online every day and I'll give you more materials or go and grind your ass out""

Yeah sure, I would much rather PA slapped me in the face and called me a bitch. 

Will I continue playing this shit? Probably, I invested to much to simply fuck off, i'm a bitch, but you my friend, you don't have to be, stay away from this ""game""....",1693761476,1693802437,False,4,0,0.570247948169708252,1,True,False,False

Graphics are great, high end computers will excel, mid range GPUs will struggle in crowded areas, but in most cases turning things down will alleviate most problems, and even that doesn't turn the graphics ugly.

cook time: 25 MINUTES

total time: 1 HOUR

yields: ONE 2 LAYER CAKE

Cake For 2 Layers 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 2 eggs, at room temperature* 3/4 cup buttermilk 1/4 cup plain greek yogurt 1/2 cup canola oil 1 tablespoon vanilla extract 3/4 cup strong brewed coffee, hot 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (optional)

Whipped Chocolate Buttercream For 2 Layers 3 (1 1/2 cups) sticks salted butter, softened to room temperature 3 cups powdered sugar 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 3-4 tablespoons heavy whipping cream Instructions

For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 2 8-inch round cake pans. Line with parchment paper, then butter/spray with cooking spray.In a medium size bowl combine the flour, sugar, unsweetened cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.In the bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand held mixer) beat together the eggs, buttermilk, greek yogurt, canola oil and vanilla until smooth.Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients with the mixer on low until there are no longer any clumps of flour. Add the hot coffee and mix until combined. Batter should be pourable, but not super thin. Stir in the chocolate chips, if using.Pour the batter among the 2 cake pans and bake 20 to 25 minutes, until the tops are just set and no longer wiggly in the center. Remove and let cool five minutes, then run a knife around the edges of the pan. Grab 2 large flat plates, line them with wax or parchment paper and invert the cakes onto the paper lined plates. Cover and let the cakes cool completely before frosting.For the Frosting: Add the butter and powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand held mixer). Beat the butter and powdered sugar together until the butter is light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the cocoa powder and vanilla and beat, scrapping down the sides as needed another 2 minutes or until there are no streaks of white. Add 3 tablespoons of the heavy cream and whip the frosting for 2-4 minutes or until light and fluffy. If desired add the remaining tablespoon of the heavy cream (I normally do) and whip until combined. Taste the frosting and add more powdered sugar if you like a sweeter or thicker frosting.Place 1 layer, flat side up, on a plate or cake stand. With a knife or offset spatula, spread the top with frosting. Place the second layer on top, rounded side up, and spread the frosting evenly on the top and sides of the cake. Decorate with sprinkles, chocolate curls or whatever your heart desires. *To quickly bring eggs to room temperature place them in a bowl and fill with warm water.

I pity every soul fallen prey to this snare. Black Desert is rife with tactics to make you spend money, keep you engaged and eager to log back in. No matter how many *free* samples you get, there is always some deficiency. There is always something new to have—something shiny and tempting continuously shoved into your face. Sometimes it is flashy gear or home décor, other times a server prompt of someone else’s success, so that the more competitive players feel motivated to measure up.

And how is it that you measure up? Black Desert lulls you with a sense of accomplishment; it has you believe you can earn everything through hard and honest work—rote slavery that robs you of tens and hundreds of hours. Do you not want to grind? Do you not want to lag behind? Well, then you have to speed things up! When it comes to upgrading gear, you have to spend an inordinate amount of both time and currency (real or in-game) to gain the best possible results. In this process, your precious item can downgrade or become destroyed. Lo and behold, even money does not guarantee success while upgrading. You can, of course, obtain gear or cosmetics through auction. But *someone* has to put that item up. Someone has to open their wallet.

Gambling and chance are Black Desert's bread and butter: either through extremely rare drops or mini-games that have you throwing dice for worthless and coveted items alike. If you pay up, you may get another try or increase your luck. You may even win a discount coupon! All of that is wrapped in an aesthetically pleasing world to make you feel at home—to create emotional dependency.

Either you sacrifice money or time and fun. And for what? Pixels and numbers within a fake world you have to share with people you probably loathe but want to impress anyway.",1691774635,1693319129,False,10,2,0.578957974910736084,0,True,False,False

Okay, anyways with over 7k hours on this game. The only reason you'd get the game on Steam is just to track your Steam hours. You don't get to exploit in-game premium currency by using Currency Exploitation, and too you will also lose out on some rewards.

If you're really interested in trying out the game, there is almost likely a free trial on the website itself which can lead to a free game pass.

Game is good, graphics are hella, fighting is amazing as fuck, but if you can't break free from your tab-targeting mindset, you're gonna have a bad time.

The cash shop is expensive as hell, $30 USD for an in-game outfit that can only be used on one character. Oh, and alts are definitely a thing in this game too. 

There are things that are absolutely necessary to the game-play like weight carrying capacity (everything you have on your character has a weight value, and some items stack infinitely) which is about $15 USD.... on sale.

For the most part, the current company that owns the rights to Black Desert regularly give out huge discounts and events that give  you vital stuff from the cash shop for free. If you play for a semi-consistent 6 months you'd have been given enough stuff to be relatively worth a couple hundred 'Murican Dollary-doo's.

Anyway, game is deeply confusing and many mechanics and game stats are obscured so if you plan on playing you should also strongly consider making the time investment to look up all the various guides. Of which, there are... many.

I heard about a brandnew overhaul of Black Desert and so I paid my entry fee and tested it out a bit. Soon I understood everything is about Seasons now. You can create a char get some boosts and have fun, right? Nope! 
Soon another higher player with the same class appeared around me and he looks the same then me. That was odd. The other thing Ive noticed: His sword optics differ a bit from mine but all in all it was the same. No visually progression at all.

A bit later I found out that I dont like my class. The class I would love to play looked like a very very young girl. Thats a absolute no no for me. Sry. Not interested!

One minute later I picked another one and I got a system error allready. I had something in my inventory and I cant delete the other char, which I tried. Ive thrown away everything and still I had that said items in my inventory. My interest in browsing different forums about this very matter was below 0.

This quick explaination sums it up very well. This new Season overhaul is overly complicated and it looks like a brand new method to sell more season passes or battlepasses of some kind and either you pick whats free to pick or not you wont erase a not interesting class too easy.

No need to tell you about the pros and cons a lot more cuz you know them very well and yes the game looks amazing but it just has too much useless items for your inventory and not enough visual progression until you reach certain story milestones. (Absolute megaboring 2 me..)

If you like to get bored a lot with dozens of systems and gamemechanics that are overly complex to a degree where you get items for stuff you dont need until your level 50 at level 5 then you have my warm welcome. Otherwise, pass for this one I suggest!
Thanks for your time and

this is a step in right direction but doesnt neccessarily mean i vive with it as a person that has played games more caring for my time outside of game than bdo

[h1] when there is a reduce to system tray cuz all rewarding mechanics need you to be on 24/7 to even function i and you (should) see that as one giant red flag[/h1]

pros:
-combat is great
-lifeskilling is fun
-the worker empire is neat touch

cons:
-your wallet needs to order a wallet (even if its for qol shit, dont)
-all stuff requires you to be logged on to even afk do stuff hence people have mass amount of hours doin nothing
-all boss drops or even remotely valueable shit is drop from lootboxes, even some cash shop stuff so either u roll the idk how big % or u roll trash. aka spin the wheel and pray
-cropplot need you to be in logged in state to even grow
-open pvp which cannot be disabled post 50 (aka non consent if anyone feels like attacking) and u dont really have a choice either cuz without eating the shard your locked to 50 and wont get your actual good powers
-worker empire need constant feeding/maintaining so god forbid you use goblins cuz you will need to log in often
-if you want the ""treasure"" items like the pots have fun doin a weekly for 20 weeks in a row each on 6 different locations where you have to kill a few thousand mobs or grind like a madman in their drop sites with a loot event
-very pay to win costumes and pets (despite the fact some pets is given for free once per account via quests, pets is account wide), also sidenote u cant autoloot without a pet so take that as you will

[b] Pros + [/b] 
[b] + [/b] Graphics.
[b] + [/b] Combat and movement is different but still pretty fun.
[b] + [/b] The story is decent if thats your thing. 
[b] + [/b] Economy is in depth and pretty complex. 
[b] + [/b] Itemization is way better than it was and they took out pay to win outright items. 

[b] Cons - [/b]
[b] - [/b] Mounted movement is janky.
[b] - [/b] Collision with enemy mobs and NPC can feel clunky.
[b] - [/b] They do have pay to shortcut though it isn't horrible.
[b] - [/b] Playing with a friend is a bit of a headache which that sucks it's a MMO. 

[b] Overall: Recommend! [/b]

Thoughts; Well I had an Awakened character some years back that was deleted because I didn't get the email to transfer my account to the new Developers servers which I meaaaan I think they did that to get rid of the large portion of BS that used to be in the game lol but hey whatever it's fine. So anyway now I'm trying it again on a fresh character and its not to terrible, I wouldn't call it the best game in the world but I think its better than the old BDO by leaps and bounds. I like they decided to add some PVE and focus more on the RPG aspect of the game, really made leveling a little better than it was thus it makes early and mid game feel better to play. Anyway, I'd say it's worth the ten bucks to check out the base game, the main aspect to focus on is combat mechanics if you like the way your character plays then you are either gonna love the game or hate it, but for the most part they have enough classes now that you should be able to find something and if not no worries it's only ten bucks. So, recommend! =)

The game still favors p2w model, but it's now more generous with gifts during its many events.  Some of the freebies were once only purchasable (real life cash) items.  Quality of life improvements make the game less frustrating for new/casual players.  Seasons also ease new players into the game.  As a result the game is much friendlier than before.  

Yes, there are still components of p2w, which is the dominant fiscal model in the MMORPG genre, but it is now easier to avoid.  Especially if you don't aspire to have all the BiS gears and be on the top ranking lists.

The game is still the best graphics amongst current MMORPG games.  It still remains a sandbox, where the player can decide what their end game goals/activities will be.  This is what I find most appealing.

The concurrent daily active subs still rank in the top 8 MMORPGs, so the world of Black Desert is still very alive and kicking.

The Good:
- Fun and engaging combat - It's different from other MMOs and takes some getting used to but it's fun.
- Story is decent - regardless of what others say, it's not a bad story.
- Beautiful game - Really pretty game, lots to explore with stunning landscapes.
- Nice cosmetics - Cosmetics are really nice looking with flowing fabrics and vibrant colors. 

The Bad
- New player experience is a bit lacking.  I had to do a lot of Googling to understand some of the core systems.  Gearing is a perfect example, see below.
- Cut scenes can be really good or really jank.
- Value pack is pretty lame, would be better if they just offered a paid sub.
- Cosmetics are expensive and per character.

My advice to new players:

- Test classes before rolling a seasonal character - You can only have one seasonal character and the option to swap isn't until 56 which is a long run if you don't like the class.   I'd recommend creating one and goofing around with it a bit.   There's a imp area by the start that's great for testing skills.  There's also a preview feature but I haven't tested that.
- Use Seasonal - I made the mistake of making a seasonal char then testing other chars and getting really far with them.   See above, don't mess up.
- Enhancing - Learn this system, it's critical to gear progression. 
- Wait on cosmetics until you're sure you love the class.  As I said above, cosmetics are per char and not account.  
- The community says all classes are viable.  I think this is mostly true but some classes are definitely out performing.  I started with Witch and the Woosa is all around a better class.   As with most MMOs, balance is an on-going challenge.",1692220723,1692220723,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

tl;dr: Don't play this game if you want a well-optimized game that respects your time and money as a player. Pretty lipstick doesn't fix foundational flaws. 

Pros:
- Many classes to choose from
- Skill animations are beautiful
- Outfits are detailed and beautiful 
- Many professions (life skill options)
- Interesting action combat that provides the opportunity for players to use both action bar skills and memorize letter inputs to flow skills together (i.e. pressing a+c is one unique ability, shift+q is another).
- Small scale PvP 1v1, 3v3 can be great fun with the action combat system.

Cons:
- The devs do not respect your time. At every turn, the game is designed to keep you playing longer even if it is while you're afk. Players are incentivized to leave their computers on and games open to afk fish/fight to continue to gain skill/combat exp or money.
- Following the above issue, players can spend hours even days farming gear enhancement materials only to fail the enhancement and either lose an enhancement level or LOSE (the process destroys it) the piece of gear.
- $$ Rules with baked in convenience items available in the shop that make one's experience far better in key gameplay aspects such as inventory management, buffs, character slots, pets, mounts, camps etc. 
- They have developed the game to hook you while you're learning and then leave you stranded without buffs that provide strong quality of life components. Subsequently, you have to either decide to suck it up or buy the buffs from the shop. For instance, the value pack is a buff that provides +16 storage slots to both personal and city storage. Once the buff disappears so do those storage slots and the player is left with little inventory space.
- The above problem is compounded by the game throwing numerous currencies, event and enhancement items, end game items, buffs, consumables, etc that you rapidly run out of storage. This problem is worsened  as you have to connect other town's storage locations through a long and tedious quest line, Magnus. 
- Even if you buy a convenience item with $, you are still left to take extra steps because the game hasn't explained what the item entails. For instance, buying a camp from the shop allows you to set it up in the world and buy buffs. However, without the account wide buff, Secret of the Old Moon, you have to send an alt to sit at a specific game location, spend in game currency, and then transfer a scroll to your main character using the tent in order to buy the buffs from the camp. 
- The story for the game is poorly written and difficult to follow. 
- The new player experience is awful. They have improved it considerably but they have to have numerous text windows, tips, warning, and external guides simply to help new players navigate the beginning stages. 
- PvP is unplayable compared to any other MMO because the game is so poorly optimized. In any large scale PvP, no effects are shown by ally or enemy players even with the correct game settings selected. The burden is put on the player to understand all 24+ unique classes in order to avoid incoming damage while seeing no effects go off. The killer is movement abilities cause players to look like they are lagging or glitching from one location to the next.

Extremely overwhelming and very poor explanations if any for the countless overcomplicated systems, prepare for intense google searching for everything+the info on google for this game are extremely limited.

Dont buy this game thinking its buy to play, because its buy to access, the 15$ subscription is 100% mandatory if you plan to play and if you have enough money you can just buy the best gear and one shot everything and everyone.

I started playing because people said that Pearl Abyss is giving away so many free premium items and its true, Pear Abyss indeed gives away a lot of gifts these days but none of them covers the very deep holes they purposely created, the holes i am talking about wont show themselves until you are well into 300+ hours of the game and these holes can only be filled with money.

Edit: All i said above are still true but BDO with all the problems it has is probably the best MMORPG at the current time.

Returning after 2 years, they literally improved only 2 things. TWO!

Studio has no idea how to predict and meet player expectations.

Every new system has glaring problems that not only don't get caught by their internal dev practices, but that never get addressed post-launch.

Waiting on animations is atrocious. It should never be faster to hit a movement key (to interrupt an animation) then hit your actual key to do what you wanted to do.

Sprinting, swimming, and many other movement systems forego their normal movement system and instead use tank controls.

Horizontal progression is way over done. Every new progression system is a parallel system to another that gets no player interaction - instead of fixing core systems, they tack on more half-assed systems to ""complement"" them.

They can't even get text input correct on dialogues.

Settings, notes, UI changes - pretty much everything that can be customized - doesn't save when you hit save: they only save once you properly exit the game. However, the game encourages you to stay logged in 24/7 and it crashes all the time. So, in practice, your settings only get saved when you consciously quit the game to specifically save them.

The QoL in this game is barely there. You have 4 + 6 + 3 equipment slots (plus more!), but the gear bag (their half-assed attempt at gear sets) only holds 8 items. It's absurdly unhelpful. This pattern is repeated virtually everywhere in the game. Then, as I said, instead of fixing the system, they will add on another that also doesn't fit the players needs.

This company is hopeless. They have no vision.",1610694306,1691782025,False,1,1,0.412363976240158081,0,True,False,False

From the moment I stepped foot into its breathtaking world, I was hooked. The attention to detail is simply astonishing, making every corner of this universe feel alive and vibrant.

Character customization is nothing short of revolutionary. Crafting my avatar felt like molding a unique piece of art, ensuring that my journey started on a personal note. The combat system is where Black Desert truly shines. Fluid, intuitive, and visually stunning, battles feel like a dance of destruction, keeping me engaged and excited for every encounter.

But it's not just the gameplay that's exceptional. The world-building and storytelling are equally impressive. NPCs have distinct personalities and stories that make interactions more than just fetch quests. The main storyline is captivating, and the numerous side activities ensure there's always something to do, whether it's fishing, trading, or crafting.

The economy system is surprisingly engaging, and the seamless integration of player-driven trade and production truly immerses you in the world's economic fabric. The node system adds depth, encouraging exploration and strategic decision-making that keeps me invested in the long term.

While the game's visuals are stunning, they do require a powerful rig to fully appreciate. Optimization has improved over time, but occasional performance dips can still occur. Additionally, the game's learning curve might seem steep at first, but the rewarding sense of mastery is well worth the effort.

The developer's commitment to updates and community engagement is commendable. Events, patches, and expansions regularly breathe new life into the game, showing that the team is dedicated to enhancing the player experience.

In conclusion, Black Desert Online is a masterpiece that offers an unparalleled MMORPG experience. Its world, combat, and depth are mesmerizing, and the sense of immersion is second to none. While not without its minor flaws, the sheer wonder of exploring this vast fantasy realm keeps me coming back for more. If you're seeking an MMORPG that offers both beauty and substance, don't hesitate to dive into the world of Black Desert Online.",1691702924,1691702924,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Be adventurer, action fight with enemies, do quests. Be trader, look for profit. Menage your workers and buildings, gather resources and make stuff. Buy home and make it homey.

It's hard to say how good this MMO is like, you must see by yourself. If you like fight like in MK games, make combos, fight, no just click buttons, be a warrior and fight in style of your class. What you have plenty of choice from.

Everything would be really cool if not GM Bots, spam bots, community of children or old children, bandits who hide behind PvP rules but their are only a neanderthalds.

I personally LOVE black desert. Granted, I started playing it a few years ago, and I'll be honest it didn't click with me. My first class was the Musa, wasn't a big fan of it at first, then I realized I wasn't a big fan of the MMORPG elements to the game. I ended up uninstalling it. 

I think in July, I decided to redownload it to give it another go, maybe I would like it. Suffice to say I slowly started falling in love with the game. It's grindy of Course but it honestly doesn't bother me that much. Not only is this game a time killer for me when I have nothing else to do but it's genuinely fun for me. I ended up picking the ninja class to restart the game and it's super fun and love the sura katanas.

That being said If you like grinding you will love this game.
Some key point to know
- It's very easy to get mid game gear now through season characters. Will take you about 3 weeks if your new to get to lvl 61 with Pen Tuvala gear ( Basically TET boss gear ) Compared to when the game first came out it took months if not years.
- Don't try to get into every aspect of the game all at once, Their are a LOT of life skills and other various activities the game will throw at you all at once. Don't bother untill you have finished your season character.
- Find a good guild!! Theirs tons out their and will help you along the way. ( plus u get passive buffs just for joining!)
-You can trial all the chars in the game and find what you like best. All characters are viable in pve so pick what you want. And if you decide at the end you don't like your character you can re roll it on season servers for free!
- Pvp is mostly end game. Joining an RBF ( it's like tdm ) with season gear will make you want to quit.
- The game has many catch up mechanics now. You get 2 free tet boss gear pieces for just finishing your season character. 1 free pen armour for doing the magnus quest line. And a free pen accessory ( worth anything from 50-70mil) for doing about 30 of grinding per day for about a month

The main take away. Try it out for awhile, if you like it stick with it. The game goes on sale often. The amount of rewards they give you through events, daily log ins, etc is actually insane. You will hit a point where you will either need to grind 5+ hours a day for things or grind enough to buy them. When you reach this point you can either switch it up and do life skilling, like horse training, cooking or farming ( many others ) or simply just relax and take things slow!

Don't go after everything at once!!! You WILL get burnt out.

However, the rest of the game, is very redundant. It is repetitive to the point of being mindless.

Annoying thing is this is not a PvP focused game but you have alot of trash players that think it is all about PvP, they will not go to the PvP server and they literally gank life skillers and players doing basic things thinking theyre pro, there are basically no penalties for this, they do not care if youre having a bad day, the dirty dogs will gank you hunting or taming horses and laugh about griefing, if this was such a life based imitation then maybe have guards in towns attack them and break their crystals so they get what drop-kicks deserve.
On top of the latency issue this game requires literally weeks at a minimum to get the meaningful things you try to achieve, upgrading to a carrack ship for example requires daily sailing back and forward at a snails pace for up to months, life skills are excessively difficult to level after a certain point, and worst of all is the enhancing system which can drain months of earned silver because even with high stacks youre lucky to have a 6% chance of success just to get to the expected AP/DP - it literally tells you % on the screen so not a random number. failure rates are very high.
Primarily ill never recommend this game to an oceanic player again until they give us a real chance at both PvE and especially PvP.

First advice to help you enjoy this game is you should invest some Pearls early for the ease of progression. Do not be that 100% f2p pleb who are bitter every inch along the way of his progression. 
The second thing to appreciate the eye candy in the game. It's an RPG after all, so having a 10 out of 10 gorgeous female character at your command is a real treat in itself. So buy some outfits and play a bit of dressup darling.
The last advice is to look away from truly bad decisions that most people think are good. Find your own path. With a certain treasure in the game, horses become obsolete. So go waste months of your life on tapping that cool horse of yours.",1691416733,1691416733,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The 'real' endgame is Lifeskill Rankings , it's so thoroughfully constructed it's almost seems realistic. IF you are the kind of player that plays a couple of hours per day , do some grind today some lifeskilling tomorrow , be ready to spend  $$ every Wednesday after maintenance to their updated shop , a n d   not minding NEVER doing actual PROGRESS on anything  but rather just spent pointlessly your time, then this is really the game for you. 

 In any other case its NOT.

   Started as grinder . ended up as lifeskiller after get PK'ed 3-4 times in a grind zone that it was one the least rewarding lootwise and all - i still wonder WHO would have come in Cadry Ruins and kill a low gear at 5AM(no dfs not anything - three hitted no questions asked) . .. i was an early riser, doing some grind b4 going to work , lets 'assume' that he was an early riser too, at Cadry Ruins ..XD - 1st Coincidence

  Added on the above , i killed while overnight Training(horse) at Arehaza..!! played the game for - well u see how many hours - i've never seen a single player in that town. And yet , someone(again), killed me at deep of night  in the most remote town of the game because i hadn't calculated the exact loop and i was 4-5m in non safe area.. XD 2nd Coincidence
 
 After i climbed my way in Lifeskill Rankings i ended up 1st  in the server i was playing in three Lifeskills . At some point i joined  a guild but after a ton of 'suggestions' at every opportunity i left. One of the funniest things was when a  guildie writes in chat : ''i have some savings but thinking of spending some in game because i'll get a job next week..'' - so now you probably start figuring out some things. .. but hey, it doesn't mean anything , any1 can write whatev they want in chats etc.  or maybe yet another 'strange happenstance'. 

 And lastly, after i left that guild, my rankings started to backtrack - from 1st i turned up to be 2nd, 3rd and lower by ''others'' , coming in channel(server) EVERY day , and bearing a well known label of guild(s). It was like ''join us - or any guild for the matter, you cannot be 1st and have no guild''. This parody lasted for about 2 months , at that point i unistalled the game-for good this time. 

  All in all , in this game THEY don't want u to be dedicated , to make fast progress etc. Because if u achieve in a year what the majority achieves in lets say in triple that time.. well there is problem. Because, paid/subscription equivalent buffs for 3 years  >  said buffs for 1 year .. . shrewd eh..? ;P  I don't know what u make from all of the above but what I made was that too many coincidences always lead to one thing- u prob now what. Also, bear in mind that a very large portion of the 'players' that are in game are devs, gm's , staff , ambassadors , etc.
   So now you may easier make 2+2 . 

As a conclussion, because i respect my free time and my $$ in equal measure, there is NO CHANCE that i'll give this game another go.

I can't say enough good things about it. Nothing can touch this game as it is a next gen experience that is still being added to. ( new worlds/ monsters/ outfits/ gear/ hairstyles/ ETC) 10/10


    You can mod Skyrim to next-gen for 7 years like I did and not even come close to the depth and polish BDO has.  Best char gen. Best animations and combat combos. Best monster design, world, outfits, etc. No instances, if you see a castle tower you just walk inside and climb the stair case. Life skills, vaulting up hills. Animations for literally EVERYTHING.  You can be as strong as you want to be, or be a nobody. The game is a true fantasy RPG experience.  Infinite quests with an actual story. Evolution of characters. Mounts, training (new animations for mount skills). Very immersive. 
You can shut off all HUD or have all the HUD. play the game how you want, hardcore (survival) or Casual. 

-Do not let the pressure to be the strongest stop you. Do what ever you want and you will succeed. 
-Many outfits and cosmetics given away for free as events. no need to cash shop (option is there)
-Can craft in game rare outfits not available on cash shop
-Can craft weapons, many weapon models. SO many character classes.
-EZ mode season character system to reach endgame quickly.
-This is not some teenager game. For $10 prepare to be immersed in a deep complex world!

A lot of it is blatantly and aggressively set up to have you spend as much money on cash shop items as possible and most of the items you buy will be locked to a single character to make you buy it again. 
The game price is just an entry fee that you pay to willingly get sucked in and then milked dry. 

Atrocious menu design, with content-scarce and low effort wikis to boot. Situation might've improved since I last played but I doubt that. 

Forced PvP in PvE zones. Be ready to do your fairshare of slogging through several thousand hours in a game with an upgrade system locked behind RNG odds as good as winning the lottery before you'll be at equal footing. God forbid you pick a class that's not the handpicked meta one for pvp or one that gets rebalanced later. Diminishing all your time, your effort and money you might've thrown at it. 

it's an absolute shame to see black desert this pretty in its world, visual effects, character weapon and armor design be wasted on what otherwise amounts to a predatory lifeless husk of a game title.

That being said...the longer you play, the more you realize the grind becomes more and more. Your first season character is a blast. By the 3rd, you realize you are at a HUGE disadvantage if you arent leaving your PC on all night/day. The game is CONSTANTLY playing, for energy and for passive income/lifeskilling.

The world is absolutely beautiful, insanely huge, the game is much more solo but it has the most active chat ive seen in an MMO (Along with tons of weirdos) but as ive reached the 3k mark (Around half if not more of that is AFKing) ive realized that I just cant take the grind anymore. After a long time you realize just how brutal the grind is, and after failing 4 attempts at BS PEN, I think my fun is over.

That being said, its a beautiful, beautiful game and PA deserves tons of love for turning the game much more casual. The P2W is still there, but its not nearly as bad as it used to be. Just...stay tf away from enhancing. The enhancing system is literally the lottery and you can lose weeks and weeks worth of mats just for nothing.

Also...id recommend you not have much of a life if youre going to play. This is a brutal, hardcore game that requires an insane amount of time to not only learn, but just play in general. I played this to death while i was nursing a broken foot. As ive gone back to normal work life, I find the game really isnt as attainable or fun with limited time at the stage I'm at.

While I appreciate the game's stunning graphics, immersive world, and engaging combat mechanics, the constant presence of randomness in crucial aspects like gear upgrading and obtaining rare items has been a major letdown for me.

Every time I attempt to enhance my gear or chase after elusive items, I find myself at the mercy of sheer luck. There is a lack of agency and control over my own progress, making it feel like a tedious gamble rather than a rewarding experience. This unpredictability often leads to frustration and feelings of helplessness, leaving me wondering whether my efforts and time investment are truly worthwhile.

In many ways, the RNG-heavy design feels like a barrier between me and the game's potential greatness. I understand that randomness can add excitement and variety, but when it becomes the primary determinant of success, it tends to overshadow skill and dedication. This design choice has made me question the fairness of the game's mechanics, and I can't help but wish for a more balanced approach that values player effort and skill as well.

As much as I enjoy exploring the beautiful landscapes and engaging in combat with other players, the persistent presence of RNG factors continues to be a significant drawback for me. I believe that Black Desert could truly flourish with adjustments to this aspect of the gameplay, providing a more rewarding and satisfying experience for players who invest their time and passion into the game.

With a hopeful heart, I bid farewell to Black Desert for now, in the anticipation that future updates might address these concerns and pave the way for a more enjoyable gaming experience.

Developed by Pearl Abyss, this game offers a seamless and immersive open-world experience, filled with numerous activities, breathtaking landscapes, and an impressive character customization system. Despite its many merits, there are a few minor cons that deserve attention. Let's delve into the positive aspects while highlighting some of its drawbacks.

Pros:

Mesmerizing Graphics: One of the standout features of Black Desert Online is its jaw-dropping visuals. The game boasts an incredibly detailed world, from lush forests and serene lakes to towering mountains and bustling cities. The attention to detail is unparalleled, making exploration a delight.

Deep Character Customization: The game sets a new standard for character customization. Players have an astonishing array of options, allowing them to create unique and personalized avatars that truly reflect their individuality. The level of control over facial features, hairstyles, and body proportions is impressive.

Engaging Combat System: Black Desert Online offers an action-packed combat system that is both fast-paced and skill-based. Players can execute combos and engage in epic battles, adding an exhilarating element to the gameplay.

Abundance of Content: The game is overflowing with activities to keep players entertained for hours on end. From traditional questing and dungeons to life skills, fishing, trading, and node management, Black Desert Online offers a diverse range of gameplay experiences.

Sandbox Gameplay: Black Desert Online embraces a sandbox approach, granting players significant freedom to shape their journey. The non-linear progression allows for diverse playstyles and encourages exploration and creativity.

Cons:

Steep Learning Curve: For newcomers, the game's complexity can be overwhelming. The plethora of mechanics, systems, and customization options may take some time to grasp fully, potentially alienating those seeking a more straightforward gaming experience.

Pay-to-Win Elements: While Black Desert Online is not purely pay-to-win, it does have microtransactions that can provide some advantages to paying players. This has been a point of contention among the community, as it may create an uneven playing field for those who prefer to avoid spending real money.

Grindy Progression: As with many MMORPGs, progression in Black Desert Online can become somewhat grindy. Some players might find the constant need to grind for resources or experience to be repetitive and time-consuming.

Server Issues: At times, the game has experienced server stability problems and occasional lag, which can be frustrating, especially during large-scale events or peak playing hours.

In conclusion, Black Desert Online is an incredibly immersive and visually stunning MMORPG that has set a high standard for character customization and open-world exploration. Its engaging combat and abundance of content provide endless entertainment for players seeking a diverse gaming experience. While there are a few drawbacks, such as a steep learning curve and pay-to-win elements, these minor shortcomings hardly detract from the overall enjoyment that Black Desert Online has to offer. For those willing to invest time and effort into mastering its intricacies, Black Desert Online promises a gratifying and unforgettable adventure.",1690896532,1690896532,True,3,0,0.541724503040313721,0,True,True,False

With that said, it's enjoyable once you get a handle on the 500 systems it uses.  This is a complicated game, but does actually have a lot of fun within it. Like most Korean MMO's, it's a total grind-fest, and you'll spend a lot of your time on repetitive tasks/fighting.  If that's your jam, then BDO is for you.  If you want a strong story-line or simplified game-play, best skip this title. 
For those who do enjoy a grind-fest, and who want to spend time learning systems off wikis more than within the game itself, there is a TON here to enjoy. Combat complexity with multiple combos, life-skills (crafting) complexity with production automation or manual operations - or both. I happen to enjoy that kind of game-play a lot myself, so I can say for others who like that, you will have fun.
The pay-for-convenience really is there, and while you can overcome most of the delays/gates with the cash shop, I found remarkably little that would be considered ""pay-to-win"" anywhere.  In theory you could go through the whole game without spending a dime, but in practice you will be picking up things like inventory space/weight increases and other things as you go to make life easier.

Unlike some other MMO's out there, this one gives you a certain freedom, but at the price of knowing what the end game is. You just have to play it for what it is, and how you want to.

The attacks feel so good, it's like that larger weapons have a thump to them when they hit, and the lighter weapons just stab and slice as you command. You also get that feel from the old dynasty warrior games of just mowing down groups without mercy. So satisfying.

They even made it to where you can use a controller to relax and kill with, but sadly it doesn't work well with the UI, not for me at least... I always go back to K&M, + the keybinds are easier for me that way with a 12 button mouse.

So much to say about it, as the game and everything you can do in it is huge. If your interested just try it.

I played about 80hours my first time before i stopped in 2021. The Reason i stopped was because of the grind for Awakening. I always wanted to be a sailor and had to get level 50 for the quest but never got to try it because of the immense grind and main quests being level-locked so mobgrinding was mandatory to progress.

Fast forward to today, 2023.

Now i started hearing a lot of new things, GOOD things about the game that peaked my interest. I have always felt that there was something underneath the rubble of grind that felt alluring.
I have so far as of this review played 90hours (so 10hours of exclusively new player experience) and want to go over the things i have felt so far has been great, and bad.

GOOD: Questing from the start was pleasant. This was something i never did before, just perma skipping cutscenes and dialog because i am too lazy to read. FAST FORWARD to now and they have added voice acting for the entire MSQ and ive learned things about the story i had no idea about before, things that are ACTUALLY interesting and have hooked me. Something only WoWs story in Legion previously had done and none after. Im finding myself constantly wanting to explore the world and find tidbits of interesting information that were revealed to me to have some sort of importance later on.

BAD: So far, some cutscenes experience popping of items / objects and sometimes dont load properly at all and just look like a wet clay figures without proportional faces speaking to me. (Although, sometimes added to the humour of their crazy dialogue)

Are you a returning player - Give it a go there are a lot of new content for PvE and PvP that i have yet to experience but is the main selling point currently

Are you a new player - Try it, it is a cheap game but beware that the return policy of steam is 2hrs gameplay time and you will likely spend 24hrs creating the perfect character so..

edit: heard black desert was mostly remastered. except, its all just worse. to start, my old account had been deleted. i hadnt played for only 10 months when they deleted it, pearl shop items and all. as far as i can tell, they say they wait longer, but not always? so i got treated to the true new player experience

of course the physical character creator was impressive when it came out, and tho it hasn't changed at all since then, its still pretty good. the lore/backstory/characteristics part of the character creator is abysmal. you decide Nothing about your character other than which sex and class you are (the same decision because of the sex division of classes), and which star sign you are born under (the game immediately admits this has zero effect on gameplay)

imo, there's so many classes (still sex segregated?? why???) that the unique identity of each is blurred and lost, leaving many of them feeling pointless or undefined. there's still the awful mobile-game style timer energy bar that painfully gates chatting, gathering materials, and lots of account actions. the game transparently and greedily asks you to mtx a package of energy every time you try to use more than you have

intro cutscene is 15 minutes of unskippable boring. its presented reallll slow as if its supposed to be impressive, but its littered with clipping, models popping in floating in T-pose, close-zoom pans across low res textures, typos in the subtitles, mistiming btwn dialogue and animation. this is with very high settings on a 2022 build. i used the default female guardian model, and every time the camera framed me next to the npc in the cutscene, my head was entirely out of frame. pretty funny tbh except it took soo long

executives gave a streamer loads of free top shelf gear to keep him around after he threatened to quit. worst, the dev worker exploitation situation has only deepened (really, look up what the devs of the mobile phone version of the game are going thru).

This one at least is within reason, and the power aspect that you get with spending money is not that impactful as a lot might think... you can buy costumes, transform them into a ""cron"" items that help you level the gear, but it would cost you a ridiculous amount of money, talking here sums of 50k $ and up or way more to get the best of the best, and even then, you will still be crap at the game, cuz even then, someone that knows how to play his class can still kill you, not 1 shot you of course cuz you payed an entire house mortgage for that gear hehe would be insane, but by the second combo you will be dead.

As for new people that get into the game... try them all, don't focus on one thing or one activity, the game is very complex, you got enough content for years to try, to play, to perfect, grinding or PVP is just one of many things, and don't be afraid!

How many of those are AFK cooking or fishing? Probably a lot. The game still fun? Yeah, it is. Let's talk.

This is still one of the most love/hate games I've ever played, and it's not subtle. Sometimes I love this game and wanna play nothing else just going between my characters, grinding my favorite spots, crafting, gathering, and pursuing the many different paths of progression. Sometimes I hate the game, everyone who plays it, and the people who made it. But I always come back, and I still recommend the game

THE GOOD: 

Graphics - This game can be very, very pretty if you have a machine that can handle some of the higher settings. The world is beautiful at times and even though I've seen practically every inch of the world many times over I still will pan over to watch a scenic view as I ride my horse around. The effects of the spells and abilities you throw out generally look impressive, though sometimes they kinda fill the screen. I like the little hit indicators signifying crits and back attacks. I can also say that the UI, though admittedly a bit for new players to get used to, is nice to look at. I don't think it really gets in the way and even if you think it does, it can be customized literally top to bottom in any way you can think of.

Combat - I love BDO's combat. This is one of the things that gets people to stay even if they have hangups about the game. It is very satisfying to learn the style of how everything fits together. If you've played fighting or other action games before, you will recognize some of these terms. Moves will have stuff such as forward guards, side guards, super armors, I-frames, knockdowns, knockups, and down smashes etc. You do extra damage when hitting an enemy in the back, and every class is very mobile compared to a lot of other MMO's out there. Abilities are activated with buttons like Q, E, Shift, left/right mouse buttons, and directional inputs to combo skills together. As you level up, you unlock flows, which can either extend a skill, give that ability a sort of clean up attack in between others, or add a sort of flourish on a skill if you hold down the input. Wizard's shift right click for example does a big water orb that explodes for damage and holding the right click to activate the flow causes him to snap his fingers and explode the area again. There are also a LOT of characters and more get added all the time. All the classes have something about them that's unique and none of them play quite the same. You can spend a lot of time learning the in's and out's of one you decide to invest some time into. You'll learn what's your best abilities are, get used to your cooldowns and resource management, what animations can be canceled, and generally achieve proficiency that's quite satisfying once you get the hang of it.

Crafting is viable - every single one of black deserts lifeskills could be a game all by themselves with their own track of meaningful progression and what's more is that they all have ways to make money which you can use to fund progression. Most everyone tends to do some form of gathering whether its mining, butchering meat, extracting blood or sap, farming, mining etc. And they do a really good job of tying into each other. While doing a lot of these lifeskills you'll receive byproducts and other items you can turn in for more goodies as well as byproducts that can be utilized in other aspects of the game. For example, cutting down trees will sometimes give you alchemy reagents. Mining gives you gems and different powders to craft with. Stuff like that. I could literally write thousands of words on just what I like to do for my cooking setup.

Freedom - the amount of things that you're allowed to do with this game blew my mind when I first started and makes you feel like your characters have a believable place in the world. You receive these things called contribution points when you complete quests. These can be spent to rent items like farm plots to plant things, invest in property, and in production/exploration nodes. They can also be withdrawn at any time and reinvested. You can just click on a town, click a building, and spend a couple points. Now you own a house. Now you can plop down some furniture, some cooking utensils/alchemy tools, maybe rent a storage chest to access your stash remotely. You can invest in those nodes I mentioned earlier and hire NPC workers to passively gather items for you. You can invest points into workshops, and use your workers to auto craft stuff for you over time. The amount of ""do whatever you want"" still feels great after all this time with the game.

THE BAD:

Very Beginner Unfriendly: For the first few days or even weeks you're playing the game you will be bombarded with complex intertwined systems and mechanics. Items that either aren't useful or seem important but don't have an apparent use to you. The game likes to throw a lot of items at you in login rewards and achievements and events and sometimes its a bit much. Pearl Abyss is trying over time to smooth this out and cut down on the amount of items in the game as well as do a better job of explaining what's going on to new and inexperienced players. That said, you will probably have to read some guides and watch some youtube or take some advice from a friend before you get into the swing

Sometimes there's jank: Sometimes I can't tell if the game is showing its age or if it's just a simple quality control thing or if it is intended. Sometimes you'll try to interact with something but your character needs to finish a movement skill animation so you have to just tap back to cancel it and then you can talk to the npc. Your horse can handle a bit wonky sometimes. The caution skill will literally bounce you backward off too steep an incline forcing you to either lock that skill or jump to keep riding your horse forward. There are a few literal hills in the game where this happens. Swimming is terrible. It's always been terrible. Don't try to swim anywhere. There used to be a ton of gear that gave you stats that weren't mentioned in the tooltip. There were food buffs that wouldn't give you the stats that they said they did. Said you got 20 accuracy, but you got 12, that kinda thing. Just weird, awkward stuff that should never happen. They do always fix these things but yeah, you play the game enough and you'll notice a bit of jank here and there.

Game really wants you to spend money: This has gotten a million times better since Kakao no longer is running the show and Pearl Abyss has stepped in after their contract with their publisher ran out. Before then, the game would throw a lot of inconveniences at you and dangle the option to swipe them away. Stuff like inventory spots, carry weight, a tent to repair your gear while not in town, maids to remotely send and retrieve things from storage. Stuff you didn't explicitly -need- but was so nice to have that you were very pressured to pay up. However, the pets were the worst. Pets pick up loot for you automatically when you kill monsters. And they were incredibly limited back in the day, practically forcing you to pay about ten dollars PER PET to get a team of five or be forced to double press R to pick up loot from each and every monster you killed. Its not that way anymore and you get a lot of stuff for free or they've changed the game to make these problems either disappear or not be nearly as much of a problem if you don't wanna spend more money.

before reading, i will be honest, i didn't contact support i was sleep deprived and had a hard time finding it. and when encountering this issue for a second time i couldn't be bothered.

for the second time in a long time, i thought i could come back and try the game (for the current free horse) and for the second time i am having a lot of problems actually playing. this time i'm giving up, completely, i hope i don't try to return in a year.

firstly i download

secondly i launch

thirdly i join server

fourthly i get stuck on a second loading screen after first one

fifthly i try to find a fix

sixthly i try to find a working fix

seventhly i have to log in myself big issue, i can't. don't remember the password can't change it through mail or phone because it just won't. it sent a message to my phone when i added my phone to secondary verification, and it was added. but when i wanted to change my password it wouldn't.

you could make the point that i should've contacted support and they could've probably easily helped me, i don't want to. i want to play working games that don't require support whenever i want to start playing again. and all the websites and pure complete annoying bunch of slop i have to manage to try to change my password, stay away from this.

can't remember the gameplay being bad though. so if you're up for some technical BS, and want to play a game with cool and lots of character customization, then go ahead i think i had some fun when i was playing a few years ago. game is also complicated in some aspects though. gl",1690260107,1690260107,False,0,0,0.456431567668914795,0,True,False,False

I didnt spend a single cent after my initial purchase and had a good time for the duration of my stay. So by all means, if you want to sink some time into a new game, this is a pretty easy entry and option to check it out.

Sadly the game falls into pay 2 win and pay 4 convenience traps. And to sell you the solution, the grind is painfully slow towards the late mid-endgame. It wouldnt be that big of a problem if it wasnt for the PvP focus. There is no dungeons or similar instances of PvE. Only the open world. Which also offers free PvP so if your luck is similar to mine, you will go out to do a quest and get hunt down by higher level players enjoying themselves killing those who cant defend themselves.

Its a shame because the game is beautiful. Its easy to get lost in the world and enjoy the solid combat system.

First off lets get this out of the way. If you are looking for a cooperative based Raiding/Dungeon crawling game where you down bosses with a group for BiS gear, this is not the game for that. With that out of the way, keep reading.

-Are you a solo player primarily?
 
-Tired of having your gear you worked for become worthless in the next patch/expansion?

-Done with grouping with randoms in order to progress your level/gear?

-Want to relax and listen to music while grinding out countless enemies at your pace?

-Looking for large scale or small scale PvP fights?

-Don't want to even worry about doing any combat at all or just do minimal fighting?

-Are you someone who loves hitting leader boards? If not then no pressure.

-Want to chase after rare and unique collectibles such as mounts and treasures?

-Life have you busy with work/family/friends and so on but don't want to feel like you'll never get anywhere as a result?

-Looking to just relax with player owned houses, gorgeous scenery and character creation?

If you said yes to any or interested in finding out more about above, then Black Desert may have a place for you. Just keep an open mind and take the game at YOUR own pace. It is a marathon game and I cannot stress this enough. The game is far from perfect and holds its own flaws like any game out there but despite its flaws it still holds out to be an incredible experience if you are willing to take the time and learn all the depth behind it.

""Game is P2W"" Yes this gets mentioned a lot. I've asked countless people on how they get their gear so strong. 99% of them have mentioned they just play the game over a long time or just get a lucky drop here and there. Yes P2W exists but its so rare to actually encounter someone who has and on top it hurts them to just walk up and kill you as a result due to the Karma system in game. There are items you can buy to increase storage and many other quality of life purchases but very few are actually needed since the devs constantly drop very generous sales, coupons and even give them away for free. By the time you'll even consider paying for such options, you'll have a better understanding of the game to make the decision if its worth buying or not. 

Pearl Abyss has made countless strides to make the game better and better over time and it keeps growing as a result. Black Desert has just been hit with very bad labels by early years or people with little to no understanding of how its many systems actually work. If you go in with an open mind and keep reminding yourself that it is a marathon and not a sprint, you may actually find your time worth while here. The gear YOU work for stays relevant for very long time. Some of the original items on release still hold up in very end game PvP/PvE to this day. Not many MMOs can say the same to that.

With its stunning graphics, intricate gameplay mechanics, and immersive world-building, it manages to set itself apart in a genre teeming with competition.

One of the game's most compelling aspects is undoubtedly its deep character customization. You're provided with a myriad of options to craft your character's appearance and choose from a wide array of classes, each with their unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. This level of detail in customization truly makes your character feel like your own creation.

Visually, Black Desert Online is a feast for the eyes. The game's graphics are nothing short of stunning, with beautifully rendered environments, dynamic weather, and a day-night cycle that breathes life into the world. It's a pleasure to simply explore the expansive and diverse landscapes, from sprawling deserts to lush forests and bustling cities.

The combat in Black Desert Online is an exciting departure from many traditional MMORPGs. Instead of the usual point-and-click system, it incorporates active combat mechanics, including manual aiming, dodging, and combo-based attacks. This makes battles feel much more engaging and dynamic, ensuring that player skill is a significant factor in success.

Black Desert Online also offers a wealth of non-combat activities. Whether you're interested in crafting, trading, fishing, cooking, or even horse breeding, there are numerous professions and hobbies to engage with. These systems are surprisingly detailed, providing a welcome change of pace from battling monsters and completing quests.

However, Black Desert Online isn't without its flaws. The game can feel overwhelming for newcomers, with its complex systems and lack of clear direction at times. Also, while the game's PvP system offers a unique thrill, the potential for high-level players to engage lower-level players can sometimes lead to unbalanced encounters.

The storyline, while rich in lore and interesting concepts, can sometimes feel overshadowed by the breadth of other activities available. Also, the quests can often fall into the pattern of typical MMORPG fare with many focusing on grinding and fetch quests.

Despite these drawbacks, Black Desert Online stands out as a deep and engaging MMORPG with a stunning world to explore. Its commitment to complex systems and player freedom creates a highly immersive experience that will enthrall fans of the genre.

In conclusion, Black Desert Online offers a vast, visually stunning world filled with adventure, action, and a deep sense of immersion. It might be a bit daunting for beginners, but for those willing to delve into its complexities, it provides an incredibly rewarding experience.",1678637080,1690110403,True,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

You get ALL available content in the game for a very cheap price. There are no expansions or subscription systems, which usually make me want to vomit. People call this game P2W, but there is only one thing you can get with money that you can't get without it, and it's the tent. The tent makes it possible to buy potions (which are useless in late-game) and repair gear anywhere you want. I don't think this item is necessary, but even if you're a bit of a tryhard it's still cheaper to get the tent than, e.g., all expansions in Guild Wars 2. You can also buy a lot of different stuff for money, but all of this is usually sold on the market, and you can buy it for in-game currency.
This game is VERY grindy. You will spend hundreds, if not thousands, of hours grinding for a part to a cool life-hacking tool. (e.g., Infinite potion) Even though this game requires you to grind, it's not that much of a burden because of the combat system. You have a lot of classes (probably around 20 atm) and every one of them has 2 skill sets, 2 completely different play styles, and 2 different weapons. Very fancy animations and skills make grinding a bit more satisfying. 
This game has probably the best character creation in any MMORPG, with its other competitors being FF14 and Lost Ark. Every class has tons of skins, some better, some worse, but the popular ones you can get from the marketplace. It's not a very efficient system because usually outfits are sold once every few months; it depends on the outfit's popularity. The scenario where you are waiting for a skin for more than a year is pretty possible.
The game has an enormous open world that isn't as boring as in other MMORPGs. The problem is that you will travel a lot, and if you don't have a good horse, you will take your time. Getting a ""decent"" horse is only really possible by buying it from another player. If you want to try catching, breeding, and training horses, there is no way you are going to make it efficient without spending real money.
One last thing I want to talk about is the community. I haven't met anyone in this game who is under 25yo. People playing this game are old(I guess MMORPGs in general have older communities, but I'm not sure).  I found this community very toxic, and that's really off-putting. 
This is still the MMORPG I enjoyed the most, and I played a lot of them. It's getting regular updates, and the game has become really welcoming to newer players with the season system. There are new classes every year, new events, and overall new stuff being added to the game up to this day.

However even after all that, the game is far from perfect especially on other areas. Here are some of main problems I've with the game.

- Questing: This one is my biggest problem with the game. The game quests are VERY JANKY and the animations in cutscenes are off-putting whenever it glitches out and it does it A LOT. I know this is not an easy thing to fix since there's so much quests in this game that needs to be fixed, but I hope that PA keeps improving this especially in future contents. The fact that new players are going to experience these janky quests firstly is the reason why many are going to be disappointed and may instantly stop playing.

- Grinding spots: Now that the game is getting more players, it's really hard to find a free grind spots. Whenever I go to for example at Elvia Orcs or Star's End (some popular grind spots), there's always players who comes crashing/requesting DFS after just few mins of me starting to grind there. This is annoying and it usually ends up me stop playing the game for rest of the day. On bright side there's 1h 05min daily private instances in Elvia Realms, which I really hope that it gets extended to 3h which would let me grind it peace. Tbh they just should bring daily timed privated instances to every grind spots outside of Elvia Realms.

- Channel hopping: On top of the previous mentioned problem of finding free grind spots, the channel hopping cooldown of 15 minutes is very annoying. That's basically wasting 15min of my time waiting to hop the channel that was previously taken into another channel and hope that the next one is free which is very unlikely. Removing this cooldown entirely or reducing it significantly would help.

On some bright note, let's talk about some things that really like about this game and feel where BDO truly shines at.

- Combat: This is pretty obvious as everyone is already aware how great the combat is in the game. All of classes in the game has excellent and high quality animations attached to their combat style with action-combat oriented controls which I find very fun and more engaging instead of traditional hot bar in MMOs (altho there's option/way to play it with hot bar if you wished to).

- Progression: Since this game is like a sandbox open-world game, you can play this game however you want and go where-ever you want to go. What's so great about it, is that you can have same end-goal as someone else, but getting to there can be very different from person to person. For example there's so many ways to reach your end-goal of 700 GS gear, you can enchant your gear till there, grind mobs or do life skill to earn money and then buy the gear from market instead or you could just work towards it slowly at your own phase by doing all of those that were previously mentioned combined. Also for new players, the progression has improved so much with Season Servers, where it's easier way to progress and by the end of it, you'll have a pretty good gear to start your journey with.

- Amount of content: I really appreciate that this game has so much contents and events and it continuously is still getting more by the quite frequent updates. Whether you're life skiller, PvE:er or PvP:er, this game has it all. There's also so many classes in the game (24+) that you can create and try out. There's so many ways to spend your time in this game. Even after all these years, I constantly find something new about this game.

- Visuals/Graphics: The game looks absolutely gorgeous. From it's weather effects to the outstanding plains and environment, the game has one of the best graphics in the whole MMO genre despite being almost a decade old game.

- Character customization: The game has one of the best character customization and I wouldn't be surprised if some spends their whole day in character creation screen.

In all I hope the game keeps improving and at least address the issues I had with the game. It's really cool that devs of the game interacts and engages with the community. I still very enjoy the game and will continue playing it as long as it keeps getting better and pump out contents by each update.",1601196251,1689765964,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

👍 The Combat system in this game is really fun.

👍 Life skill professions are also done nicely in Black Desert.

👍 A lot of gear equalized content, to some degree reducing the impact of pay to win.

What changes I would like to see:

 ⚠️ Need to increase inventory slots and weight granted by value pack by a margin!

 ⚠️ Need to make outfits un-meltable at blacksmith for cron stones upgrades (cosmetics should be cosmetic, cron stones prevent downgrade or destruction of gear or accessories respectively when used in enhancing/honing gear)

 ⚠️ Need to add a party finder for dungeons and add more dungeons/bosses.

I feel like the game is at a crossroads and can go either way at the moment. The game has a lot of item bloat so you'll nearly max out your inventory and all of the different city storages available within 80 hours of playing if you hoard items like a beginner, then what you can do is spend money to expand it, also the weight limitations will cause you to stop grinding every 30 minutes. As a player with a value pack and 4x weight expansion from loyalty store, when grinding polly forest I had to stop every 30 minutes due to weight, meaning I was wasting some of my time from the 1 hour XP scroll buffs I have consecutively used beforehand.

Now to the negatives, some of these are personal taste, some is just badly designed on purpose so you spend:

👎 DAMAGE NUMBERS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. This is to compensate for the bad class balancing, instead of throwing out 23+ classes, how about you focus on balance?

👎 Item bloat: One type of monsters can drop like 5 gray vendor items, 3 or 4 coursair training (something with horses idk), different type of enhancement materials, and you generally get your inventory filled up really quickly.

👎 Inflation: In the end game you are counting money in the millions and billions, either introduce gold as a character bound currency, worth X silver, to auto convert and make business as regular or find a way to make the big amounts count, spending 3 million silver in this game is like spending 50 copper in WoW.

👎 Weight limit: Serves no other purpose but to give incentive in buying additional weight capability. Why do gray vendorable items have 0.10 weight attached to it?

👎 Class identity: A great majority of classes are basically the same, it's AOE with different colors mostly inside a mid-range or close range melee category, only 3 classes can be even somewhat good at range: Witch, Wizzard and Archer, this is out of like 23+ classes meaning at least 20 classes and almost twice that of specializations are just different flavors of melee and midrange circular attacks.

👎 A lot of sub systems mixed into the convenience of the game making it confusing at the time to know what does what, requires a lot of youtube and google.

👎 Questing and the scenario of quests is usually so bad, that just listening to the NPCs/reading quests or watching cutscenes will make you feel your brain turning into mush, press and hold R, skip when you can.

👎 Fairy and Maid systems are not a good experience, the first one can auto consume potions but requires luck to get the correct tier of fairy and is a remnant of the pay to convenience, and the latter is required to access storage or auction market globally.",1689749001,1689749001,True,57,1,0.803959965705871582,1,True,False,False

When it first launched it was ahead of the times. Now its a laughing stock of an MMO.

Graphically it is stunning (character models) particularly the females , when the game inst suffering terrible pop ins, glitches and terrible line of sight problems. When it functions it is a very pretty game indeed.

This is easily the best CREATE A WAIFU simulator out there in the mmo space.

That is the only good thing about this game.

Everything else is garbage. The over bloated menu systems the terrible optimisation, 
The over complicated quest design, the terrible sub menu and trading system.

The whole game needs overhauling from the start to the attempted ""new version"" which is effectively a soft reboot of the game.  However why give players a choice to start there , just make players start there and build the game around it.

I was one of the first to actually BUY the game before it went F2P. The in game purchases are what you expect from mobile and F2P games, but when I bought the game it was not a F2P title.

I never got any recompense for that or any bonuses for having an OG account. 

The Combat and the combo system is why this game is still popular and it can be very fun if you find the right group of people or friends to run around in the pop in world to enjoy. However it does not last for long
and the grind for xp and boring quest design soon shines through.

Its a shame because this is easily one of the better looking games in the MMO market its just a shame aside from the beautiful females you can create and the fun combat system everything else is god tier awful.

I played this game quite a bit on my xbox as well and its even worse on there.
What a shame. 

Should have been better.

There is fun to be had, but its short lived, only play if you have friends to play this with. Otherwise it gets boring fast despite the awesome combat and female characters.

I really want this game to succeed and to enjoy it with some old friends from games that will go unmentioned, need to fix some of the issues particularly with Atoraxxion where you need 5 ppl to complete part of the story to actually run the dungeon -.-' this is after several fixes to bugs already going on within the dungeon itself partly with the puzzles, not enough explanation for beginners to BDO.  


previous edit: I'm going to give BDO another chance with the new content patch otw.  However, the server does need some optimization due to lag spikes that come out of nowhere it seems now, could be due to influx of players but, needs checked before the new content launches. 

edit: Overall the game is great, some quest's are kinda buggy and take a few extra minutes to solve, the special dungeon is somewhat buggy but it could just be me lol. Also, some people do not like the ""Rift Echos"" that is used to summon tiered phases of bosses in a specific location near velia, I think they're a great addition to the games' seasonal servers as I feel it helps new players further develop their skills with a new class they are trying out possible for the first time and further learn party etiquette and UI interface of such, drop rates need increased (or added in another way) for Echo's so players can feel accomplishment from earning extra materials for enhancement while enjoying group play. Enhancement this season (23'summer, June.) seems less successful even with 71~91% chance, even though you'll hear, ""It's not 100%"" it's still seems off for the success:loss ratio.

Heck play new world at this point its better and i even hate that game but i'd pick it over this trash. Hell i much rather spend a week in a room with the league community then talk one moment in this game. Oh and the gear it gives you is TET gear which most will tell you isnt ""good"" but when they first did it they might as well shit on everyone who got it themselves  beforehand. 

Ontop my point if your still reading by this point and not running to that clown award like your life depends on it. 

Point 

This game is the most simple grind you will ever do in a game and if thats what you are looking for then go for it but if you want something more fun i wouldnt say play this game i would say go somewhere else. Also if grinding is what you want heck even FF14 has a better grinding system and they dont hand out everything for there players. The company now only cares about money and nothing else honestly i wouldnt be shocked if the fanboys run to that clown award really thats all they know how to do. 

So if you really want to play this game go right ahead and if you enjoy it good for you, i also did at one point but that was when the game had a grind and was fun to get something now its a P2W mess like most games. Again if this is something your alright with then stay on the game no one is telling you you cant, all i am saying is please dont waste your time its not worth it.

For all the new players this game has a large learning curve and can be extremely overwhelming if you do not already have friends who are willing to give a helping hand.

It has just about everything you can think of, so it more than likely has something that you will enjoy doing. My advice though, if you decide to try it is as soon as you start playing the game find a good guild to join! There are people that will be more than happy to help you with anything you might have questions about. If you end up in a guild that does not have helpful people, then leave it and find another one.

- Character customisation is amazing[/b] (I'm talking from the perspective of the female characters, I have to admit I haven't made any male characters.) You also get about 15 days free customisation on already created characters if you're new to the game - just hit F4 in-game to be taken back to the customisation menu. Customisation differs slightly between classes, with some hairstyles/tattoos only being available to certain classes.

[b]- The combat system,[/b] this is definitely the best part for most people - currently I've only played extensively on the Corsair, but her combat is really beautiful. You can tell they've put a hell of a lot of thought into this aspect of the game, and it's really paid off. All classes have their own unique combat, including unique effects - for example, [spoiler]being pirate themed, the corsair has a lot of water splashing effects & will also activate a mermaid/siren appearance during some combat skills.[/spoiler]

[b]- Game has a horse taming system.[/b] In fact, this was my main reason for getting the game. The system is difficult to get used to, but again with some time spent googling, you get the hang of it. I've found the best method is [spoiler]4 sugar cubes + 30 second wait, I've never been kicked more than once doing that.[/spoiler]

[b]- All of your created characters will share your worker empire, mounts, and city/town storage.[/b] (They don't share skills, but this is why you should have a main character to focus on. Your main draw to creating alt characters will mainly be because they have separate energy levels - this is needed for hiring workers or unlocking new trade locations if you can't be asked to run all the way over to them.)

[b]- Residences.[/b] Along with being able to set up workshops, storage houses & worker lodging, you can also own up to 5 residences for personal use. These can be decorated with furniture from the pearl shop, or from furniture vendors, plus it's a place to keep your pets.

[b][u]Now on to the negatives:[/u]

- Lack of hand holding.[/b] The game has so many features, and explains nearly none of them. This does make the game difficult to get into, and really takes you out of the experience when you have to keep referring to google or the adventurers guide.

[b]- No fast travel system.[/b] Again, this is another draw to creating alt characters, as your character can be transported while you play on another character, but I just think this is odd. The developers have clearly acknowledged the long travel times by adding this feature, but surely a fast travel feature would have been far easier to put in place? Even if this is only available between cities, similar to World of Warcraft.

[b][u]Overall,[/u] the content in this game is the main draw point.[/b] It's like a mix between an RPG and an empire tycoon. (If you choose to work on the worker gathering and trading aspects of the game, that is.) My main issue would be the lack of hand holding in this game - it's great that they encourage players to figure things out for themselves, but you end up spending a hell of a lot of time on google trying to figure out how to do anything.

I hope that this review has been helpful, I personally love the game, and although I have a few issues with it I don't think they are big enough issues to put me off of trying to work around them. Thank you for reading.

[b][u]235 Hours Update: It's been a while since I first started this game and wrote that first review, so I figured I'd check in again from the perspective of a later-game player - my newly discovered pet peeves are below:[/u]

Horse Breeding -[/b] This is a feature I would have LOVED to use more, but with males only having x2 breeding chances and females only having x1 before you have to spend real money to reset them, I think this system very quickly becomes a huge hassle - of course you could always capture wild horses and breed them 1-2 times before needing to capture more horses to replace your breeders, but again this is a lot of work for even just low tier horse breeding.

[b]Dyes -[/b] A beautiful feature in BDO is being able to dye your clothing and also your horse's armour - you obtain these dyes either by a monthly subscription to a pallet that gives you access to all dyes, or you can play russian roulette with the random dyes to get something close to the colours you want, and have them permanently. [spoiler](There is of course a select few dyes that are on the players market, but these are very rarely stocked and will cost your life savings of in-game coin.)[/spoiler] [b]This system is absolutely horrific,[/b] I understand it must be quite the money maker from their end, but from a players point of view this is just a needlessly painful system.

[b]The story is... Meh.[/b] I admit this may just be my short attention span, but I find myself skipping the dialogue pretty much constantly before hitting the rare cutscene and going ""WOAH what's happening here???"" - more frequent cutscenes would have been brilliant, but maybe that's just me. I also acknowledge that takes way more time than just giving you a few text boxes.

[b][u]Now just to do things backwards from my original review, here's some things I've gained even more appreciation for since the start of this journey:[/u]

The in-game world really is gorgeous,[/b] I can't help but stare in amazement at so many of the places I ride by, and I have such an appreciation of getting to know the trails that I take often and starting to recognise the small features of the land as you make your way back home really is such a nice feeling. Even after all this time, I still don't feel like I've explored everywhere.

[b]Residences -[/b] I have such a love for games that give you a home and allow you to choose exactly where you'd like to call home - I think this feature is so cozy, with being able to come back to your pets and all your storage items, stopping by to craft and cook, stopping by the furniture vendors in Calpheon to bring a ridiculous amount of candles home - living in Britain currently where mortgages are becoming insanely expensive, having a place to call your own even just in a game really brings a lot of peace.

[b]Character customisation just keeps getting better -[/b] I don't mean to repeat everything that I already had an appreciation for, but honestly seeing your character evolve with you really is a nice feeling, I will admit I have spent far too much on cosmetic items (Dyes included, even though I still hate their system) it is really nice to have your own unique look, and to see everyone else's styles through their characters too.

[b][u]Overall, I think you can see where I stand on this game - [/u][/b] I very much treat this game as just a pretty cozy life sim game most of the time, and it stands as a solid game even if you only focus on those features. Whenever you're in the mood to quest and start fights, that option is open to you.

It really is such a diverse game, and I couldn't recommend it more for anyone with an interest in life sim games, rpg games, combat games, empire tycoon games - or even just a pretty game to take screenshots in.",1660823440,1689496927,True,32,0,0.768244922161102295,0,True,False,False

Some people call that pay to win, but its truly not.  There is so much grinding in this game, you have to work for it.  Spending $ just makes your time in game more efficient, it does not make you overpowered in anyway.  Its a beautiful game to play at 4k as well.  I highly recommend it, especially on sale.

EDIT

Came back like many others, a lot of good foundational updates and QOL updates that resolved my complaints.  This game used to be brutal to hit level 61, and then ten times as brutal to get mid 200s AP/DP... Now you get that in a couple casual weeks playing seasonally.  Lots of good content updates, new story lines, and ways to play the game at your own pace, with less reliance on spending irl.  I won't say that they don't make it worth it, they absolutely do, but its also a worthwhile purchase here and there, and if you're enjoying the game I am okay with that, especially with its cost of entry.  They have really shown some listening ears, and taken well to the players desires.  Hugely unexpected turn of events.",1498441828,1689480958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game feels like you are thrown in the middle of casino. So many flashing icons, daily, hourly ""click here"" where reward is something you don't know what is it good for. Combat, gathering, crafting? Sure we have those. No we won't spent time explaining how to do basic, because... look another flashy icon click it! Oh back to combat, just smash your keyboard randomly it will do the trick. I did not? Just smash more keys it will work. You care to know what are those icons or what effects the skills you use have? Forget it, animations are cool that's all you need to know.

For real now. Graphic is nice, combat looks cool and game probably has many options to keep players busy. I say probably because not many of the game mechanics are explained to you. There is some story line with narrated quests and it feels weird to be honest. Audio is out of sync or not playing at all unit you interact with NPC again. I have never seen so many graphical glitches related to texture collisions and lighting in MMO game ( This is first modern MMO I played in a while so it might be ""standard"" in these days ). HUD is in default filled with stuff I don't need or even worse find very annoying. I really don't care who failed enchanting their item and don't see any reason to pop up alert message with sound to let me know about it ( can be turned off in settings ). Instead I would like to know how to make font size bigger and letters looks crisp, since changing HUD size can make it hard to read. 

//Giving the game another chance. I can confirm previous statement, too much stuff very confusing. Because the season exp bonuses, you really don't spend much time in places where basics are explained by quests (gathering, cooking, etc.). At level ~60 there is next ""progress"" in combat style and I have no clue what is going on with this or what to choose and what I loose for it. This is the final point for me. I learned quite enough about professions but combat is just smashing keyboard... no idea how those combination works, with season equip mobs can't even scratch you so it does not matter.

Why should you play Black Desert Online you might ask yourself?

Black Desert is ultimately THE BEST Sandbox MMORPG out there.
Do what you want, enjoy what you want. If you don't like it then don't do it, in Black Desert Online you are froming your own path.

Since its first release things drastically changed, we swapped from Kakao Games to Pearl Abyss which has been the best thing that could've happen with this game. The old Cashshop Company Kakao Games is not involved with this Game anymore hence giving us the Cashshop we have today. Since the Game is under Pearl Abyss's roof completly and alone, you are getting free items. Do you ever need to purchase something from the Cash Shop? Yes you do, the Pearl Tent. 
Is it expensive? 50 Bucks and you decide if you grab it for that price or cheaper, you can get it for 15 Bucks too if you're buying it in sale combined with coupon and once its time that you kinda have to pick up the tent, you have sunken hundreds of hours into the game anyway.  So what are you getting for your  5 ( 55/20 bucks).
You get a great Sandbox MMORPG where you decide what you do. 
Are you a fan of grinding then go grind.
Do you want to lifeskill/Sail a Ship or just take screenshots? Go ahead. 
Whatever you want to do you probably going to find it here. 
Don't listen to the but its a job game of comments...
It can be, they decide it to make it a job. Show me a single MMORPG besides FFXIV where you can pepega clap everything in a day. 5 heads nowadays think a game needs to be done in a day or two. BDO is a marathon, if you decide to grind you decide to grind. You don't need to if you don't want. The Game has Seasons which will give you a headstart in this, but since Arena of Solare is out, enjoy your gear balanced pvp where you can jump in without any restrictions, where experienced players clap you anyway cause you are simply a bad player and they actually saw the potential of the game instead of complaining about having to grind in a MMORPG.

A ton of videos and people have been bragging about how good the experience is now for new players. I made a new account and logged in. 20+ minutes of unskippable cutscenes and p2w instantly thrown in my face. BUY THE BATTLE PASS WEEE day 1 get an outfit box you can sell on the market for 600+ million silver. So literally selling silver for $..... what a sick joke
Nothing has changed, don't be fooled by idiotic youtubers and fan bois trying who are paid to speak positively about the game, or who are trying to save this dying game....
____

I played this game when it launched originally in KR. 

It wasn't very enjoyable because of the lag, and the NA players stood no chance in PVP.

I quit the game 

One day saw that BDO had come to steam!

Alright finally time to play on NA servers!

I played a few hundred hours before quitting...

Finally I decided I would give BDO one last try

I made 5 characters within 4 weeks

a lvl 60- Shai for the event
a lvl 59- Archer 
a lvl 61- Mystic 
a lvl 60- Warrior
a lvl 61- Guardian 

Okay so here's what I've learned, and here is why Im quitting for good this time...

1. Questing will level you faster than grinding ever will. This is up until lvl 61 where after you hit 61 you get 100x less exp from questing than at lvl 60. So 1-61 is easy , everything else after that is the most cancerous grind you could imagine. Around .1 to .3% exp per hour of grinding depending on your gear etc.

2. There are way too many p2w things in this game. Anyone who says this game isn't p2w is delusional...

Here are all the p2w options that exist in the game

- You can buy more weight to make it so that your character can hold more items. This is important because the devs intentionally made potions weigh a fuck ton so you can barely keep any on you. 

- You can buy more inventory slots ... 

- You can buy more character slots - This is broken because you can make alts and position each one at different ""world bosses"" so when one spawns you can just change characters and boom no need to travel across the world...

- You can buy a Tent - The tent you can buy is 50 dollars and makes it so you have an additional storage and your own personal vendor. Vendor sells potions and you can sell trash loot to it which is huge since silver has no weight anymore. Finally an ""anvil"" that lets you repair without going back to town. The way the game was programmed your gear breaks after just an hour of grinding and you have to go repair it. You lose alot of time without a tent. Tent is 50$ and there is no ingame ""free"" equivalent to this. This is considered MANDATORY by all hardcore players...

- You can buy pets that auto loot for you. You cannot play this game without pets.. 
When you are doing ""rotations"" or farming in an area you need to be able to loot and move on. However manually looting requires you to walk over the exact loot drop, and press R , press R again. So stop and double tap R and lose minutes every rotation looting.
Pets are mandatory and not exactly cheap either. When you buy a pet from the pearl shop its a tier 1 pet. You can smash pets together to make higher tiers. Up to tier 5!
Some people have 5 maxed out tier pets which probably ran em a few hundred dollars per pet.

- You can pay to win @ enhancing
You can buy outfits from the pearl shop and then ""extract"" the cron stones out of them. You can then use the stones to protect your gear from degrading when you enhance.
You can also protect accessories from exploding when you fail. Not only can you do that, but you can directly sell these outfits on the market for like 200 mill silver. 

- The PVP in this game is 100% gear based
(Dont listen to any idiots that say its skill because its not. Better gear always wins)
Skill only factors in if you and your opponent have identical Gear Score.
Every class is pretty easy to learn, and after grinding for hundreds of hours you will easily master your ""combos""
However... if someone has a total of 300 AP they get a bonus of 200 AP.
The game grants you bonus stats for reaching certain thresholds.
(AP stands for Attack Power/Points and represents the base number that your skills use to multiply with the damage percentages to deal damage.)
Most new players have under 100 ap and it takes awhile to work up to 200.
It can take years to get to 250 ap and the people close to 300 will hit 300 before you ever will
Which means you will get fucked everywhere you go

- If someone pk's you, you will lose 1% exp. This is huge at higher levels and you can avoid this penalty if you pay for pearl shop items.

- There's a transaction maid and marketplace butler that let you access storage/marketplace from wherever you are. Normally you would have to go to town or to the correct npcs. This is huge P2W.

- You can buy more storage in every town with real money

- You can buy worker residence that you cant get any other way with real money 

______________________________________________

The p2w is one thing... but there's more 

For example the game tries to make you stay logged in and keep your computer on....

If you afk you can make money or get exp/skill point by afking etc

Some people will afk grind for months just to reach higher levels... how pathetic

In a time where everyone is trying to save money, BDO tries to make you keep your pc on...

There is also no fast travel so you spend a ton of time auto traveling from place to place... 

The amount of p2w in this game is unreal and if you play this game you will eventually feel forced to drop more and more and more money...

The devs made the game in this way to leech every bit of $ from their players while providing very minimal content

It gets worse though... the main selling point of this game is PVP and GuildVsGuild

However the PVP is super laggy/stuttery and not balanced at all..

Gear will trump everything of course but certain classes are massively stronger than the rest...

Not only that but people can RMT by selling guild payouts 

When a guild captures a node or city they make alot of silver that goes into the guild bank

The guild leader can issue ""payouts"" that take 40% of the total guild funds and send em to all the members

Well massive guilds bring in more silver by capturing cities for a week than some guilds make in over a year

The old guilds that have been around for a long time probably have trillions in guild funds 

If you haven't gotten the hint yet it means you will never compete with people that been playing for a very long time

This game needs ""seasons"" and ""wipes"" to stay competitive 

OR 

Gear needs to not be nearly as important in PVP, as it is now (where gear is the only thing that matters)

The game is grindy beyond imagination and you will have to make this MMO your fucking JOB to actually enjoy it

There are plenty of other games and soon to be released MMO'S that wont do this to you

Don't make the mistake that so many people made in this game sinking tens of thousands of hours( and money) and regretting it 

I want to add that I did enjoy the concept of the game and animations so much.

I wish I could love and enjoy this game but im not a SIMP

The choices the Devs made on this game killed it. Im sure there are plenty of SIMP's who will continue to play and support the game financially

The amount of Grind and P2W cannot justify the gameplay

Eventually everyone gets fucking sick and tired of rotating their cooldowns and the only part of the game left to enjoy is the PVP...and the fucking PVP is dominated purely by Gear Score.. 

Which can be achieved through p2w and most of the players who have been here since launch will just wipe the floor with you

A guy that started 1 year ago and is still grinding, will always surpass you

There are people who have been playing since launch.. good fucking luck m8

Keybinds don't save even after hitting ""Apply"" followed by ""Confirm"". Keep in mind this is an MMO, which means every time I boot the game I have to fully rebind all my keys. Haven't even been able to get through the tutorial due to this garbage because every time I boot up the game I spend 30 minutes rebinding keys.

There's a black spirit. If you play Genshin, imagine every bad thing people say about Paimon but this time it's true. The Black Spirit will pop up and try and tutorialize the game for you by telling you what to do. But guess what, both the Black  Spirit and the hotkey ""tips"" they give you cannot be removed during the tutorial (or at least I haven't seen how yet, you can't modify the UI in the tutorial) use the default keybinds, meaning if you've changed them the tips they give you are wrong.

Did I mention you can't alter the UI in the tutorial? Who the hell thought this was a good idea.

Game looks really bad and washed out even at max settings.

May get a refund, may just let it sit on my account. Doubt I'm actually going to play it though. To be clear to everyone though, as a veteran of WoW, GW2, EQ, all that ""quality of life"" content creators are bragging about doesn't mean jack when getting through the tutorial of the game is torture.",1689167499,1689167499,False,2,1,0.497461915016174316,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Amazing graphics, best out of any MMO by far
- Biggest Life skills system out of any MMO by a longshot (Only runescape I'd say is even compared, but barely)
- Full Deep Character customization (the amount of detail you can add to a character is insane)
- Friendly/Welcoming Player Base (Most friendly MMO Playerbase I've ever experienced, just welcoming people in general)
- Intermediate to hard and grindy Content that makes you feel accomplished when finally achieving your goal, especially if you go the F2P route. (F2P takes time, but it is possible and by 1000 hours or so, you could have a really high GS and nice empire built up if your smart about how you play in the beginning)
- World Content has things like Boss encounters with tons of active/ different types of servers defeating the boss at the same time, even sailing content or hunting. The sailing takes you on the seas with cannons and boats like an old Pirates of the Caribbean meet up. Many, many boats show up to fight the sea monster/ monsters. Theirs also content where a big Hunt party tracks a certain monsters around the world at a fast rate and the group or platoon to do the most damage in these events gets a special reward, along with the regular award. 
- There is tons of Daily Content you can do, one is known as rifts which reaps great rewards and is a nice way to get silver and more items to help your adventure. You can do it alone on regular servers or together with friends in Dark Rifts, but only for season servers. Also don't forget about daily professions quest because there are plenty of those + regular daily quest like any other MMO. Theres also team rifts you can do with friends, it's triggered when everybody adds the same amount of summons to the this floating daimond artifact, it's fun and can be a challenge too.
- Season characters - SEASON CHARACTERS are toons you can create that have higher XP gains and everything such as a leveler needs to level up fast. These characters play on specific servers and get many perks even free upgrade materials and chances to upgrade Gear in the future better. This character makes the Paying to Win function irrelevant because these characters XP can be copied, thus making another character the same level as your season character when your done with the season! This is more valuable then having a deep pocket 100%. SOO this character (if you level it up) is a free boost plus 1!! In BDO having more characters helps your overall family of characters, it increases daily rewards in almost all aspects, especially if they are leveled up to at least LVL 56. 
- Instance Content - BDO offers a plethora of instance content and a lot of it gets integrated with the game itself + your friends, nothing in BDO gets left behind. When you complete things like the Magnus or Antoraxxion you open up more instance content availability and also more convenience items to help you in your Journey.
- Beautiful Animations/ Remastered mode
- Great Central market with being able to buy things that you can buy with real money, with silver. So if you can earn the silver you can buy it, most things are reasonable in the market too, this actually builds the games economy while simultaneously building the player morale and incentive, its like a return.
- Best Combat in any MMO by far, more flashy, more effects (you can dimm the effects like I do) more moves, more options and key combos like a fighting game..(LOL  WUT!) 
- 26 Players Classes.....like WOWW need I say more....
- Worker/ Empire building - By far the best part about the game. The worker system involving Contribution points and energy is phenominal. You gain energy and Contribution through questing and discovery, one way is by defeating enemies, thus giving you the knowledge on that certain enemy you defeated. This increases energy. Things like touching a book on a wall in a library can give you knowledge, also increasing your energy. Quests from what I  can tell give you the most contribution. Overall this system incentivises exploration and travel, making the player discover more :)
- This ones going to be controversial, but I love the weapon upgrade system, it adds way more spice to upgrading gear than any other game. Thats because theres a chance it will fail and even downgrade the weapon, even degrade it making you have to pay big silver to repair. This is frustrating to some but this is also why the grind is rewarding when you do get that upgrade finally, like you earned it buddy GRATS for real! So that being said cash will not help you in this aspect unless you are literally filthy rich and have  10,000+ to spend or more. Thats very unreasonable too and honestly youd'd have to spend more than 10k to max a charcter. SOOO its hilarious that people say this game is P2W...its not at all unless you have 20k buddy, moving on. I'm guessing half of the people or more who play this game play it for free or at the least dont pay a a lot. The monthly pass is worth it, I'd say. Though its like a sub, it gives you certain benefits but I would stay away.
- Loyalty Points: You gain these for signing in once a day, you can use this currency for rewards to help you on your adventure.

Cons
- PearlShop can be very expensive and the prices can be predatory to players
- Pay for convienience is there (NOT PAY TO WIN)
- Pay real money for small amounts of materials and other items such as Pets, horse skins, apparel + more cosmetic is available (Not enough materials to make a true difference unless you sign in everyday. At that point you'd use the loyalty currency they have for signing in once a day)
- World chat can get annoying to look at, I prefer to shrink mine

I have 7000h+ and i think 5000h+ of this is afk time (there is a ton of afk things you can do to earn money, playing the actively will result in much faster gear progression, obviously....) For 10 euro/dollar, i recommend this game.

[b]Pvp 6/10:[/b]
Cons: Not balanced, doesnt require any skill, gear dependant, heavy d-sync, class carried, not interesting battleground, large scale pvp = lagfest
Pros: Non-target, cool animation, interesting combos, fast paced
Conclusion: Pvp is interesting if you have friends to fight against, and after you reach the minimum required gear to do it. Until then, dont even bother...
[b]Updated PvP ?/10:[/b]
2023. Still D-Sync-ed, more batllegrounds, not sure about anything else, but at high-end it's skill based, also Arena of Solare with capped gear which is nice

[b]Pve 6/10:[/b]
Cons: Repetitive, boring, no dungeons, no raids, basically an offline game
Pros: A big variation in grinding spots, till you reach endgame
[b]Updated PvE 8/10:[/b]
2023. Same as before, but now we have weekly dungeons and weekly solo boss ""rushes"" with leaderboards (if you are interedted, google ""BDO Boss Rush""), even more grind spots

[b]Lifeskills ?/10:[/b]
Never tried, wasnt interested, but there is a large variety of lifeskills you can do, like gathering, fishing, alchemy, cooking, sailing, etc.
[b]Updated Lifeskills ?/10:[/b]
2023. Still not doing lifeskills :) But heard there are some changes, also sniper hunting which is currently the best money/h in the game which is nice

[b]Graphics 9/10:[/b]
Best visuals i have ever seen in an MMORPG, can be glichy sometimes in certain areas...
[b]Updated Graphics 9/10:[/b]
2023. Remastered mode, there are some grapichal bugs here and there, but still beautiful.

[b]Gameplay 9/10 before it gets boring, after its a 6/10...[/b]
2023 Update: still standing beside this

This game is beautiful. I mean beautiful. Followed by Gameplay and Story this honestly is a nearly 10/10 perfect MMO. However the main flaw that messes it all up is the pay to win features.

I want to say, just try it. Play it till you start to feel like your grinding then stop. However there are a lot of people with addictive personality that need to stay away from this. Once you dip into your wallet with in game items, most people cant stop. 
You will also have to keep in mind. There is also no getting to the top of the leader boards in PVP, Collector items, or other in game goals with out that wallet being opened.

Developer seems to working to make game better, with some good freebees lately, and  adding new content and some new armor pieces.


Cons:  It""s a game that requires many hours to achieve success.  The armors and weapons are still somewhat limited and the upgrade system is still one of the worst if not the worst in gaming.  The RNG rates in this game are definitely not favorable to the player. Be prepared for all you hard work of gathering and grinding upgrade materiel quickly goes up in smoke at the push of one button.  I would equate the RNG system to gambling because everything is basically a random chance.  You will not be able to achieve much until you get a high gear score, which will take forever.  While I like the game, I find that I must step away at times to maintain that like.

I would recommend it to a new player looking for a MMO to play if you are into grinding and have the time to put into it. Be prepared to be frustrated and piss off.

I writing to inform you about this game.

See the is a player whose actually name is Buffy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcA86A0HdSg

Yes See this game is Good. Fun for the family and all that But this player Buffy who plays on both the Na and EU server will simply not allow anyone play

Here are the charactics of Buffy

1. She will walk around crying that the game is bad no enjowment
2. She will come across a good player and say eeeeeeeeeeeeeee
3. She will challenge the player to fight.
4. She will get her butt handed to her
5. She will now follow the player around everywhere.
6. Challeging the player to fight non stop
7. She will continue to get her butt handed to her
8. She will start to hack very badly
9. She will hack so badly that she will actually add new classes that are not avaible to the game
10. She will then challegne the player to a fight over and over again
11. Again she gets her butt handed to her
12. She and her rountine will then spam the forums complaining the the player she's harrassing is to powerfull
13. She will come out with nonsense arugment after trash asking non stop for the class to be nerfed
14. They will actually perform DDoS attacks on the directors server to force the director to nerf the class
15. Even if the director beats the attack they will continue to harass the director even traveling over to korea to harass him personally
16. They will follow him to events all around the world asking for the class to be nerfed
17. The director will look into this and he is so annoyed by what they have done he will say yeah fine nerf the class.
18. Buffy will challenge the player again and still get her butt handed to her
19. Buffy will repeat this nerf hack cycle until either the player quits or the class is nerfed so badly it can't function
20. if the player quits buffy will follow the player to the new game they are playing to challenge them to fight after fight.
21. Thiis is why the director agrees to make sure the player keeps what they are good at
22. Buffy has done this to mutiple games. In Black desert the whole game got nerfed because of buffy, her hack and her need to win
23. In some game a whole new game system had to be implentmented and loss of alot of money to player base just so buffy can be number 1
24. Buffy is actually a spastic.
25. Buffy cannot play to save her life
26. She honestly has to be number 1 because she know she's the worse player in the universe and if she thinks about her bad she is who knows what will happen

Parents. Be carefull how you let your child play this game.

If they are good at it.

You will certainly run into the Buff

And anything could happen tonite...

- there are some issues with collision detection: getting stuck on terrain, getting hit by area effects when I am well outside the visual effects
- some animations will lock you for a couple seconds
- frequent late rendering of 3D assets so that the game feels like it cant keep up with rendering
- some quests can be frustrating with incorrect markers or unclear instructions

I like the way you just go out, run your circles, make money by killing mobs all over again. Its a simple life. No need for partyfinders and shit. You wake up 3am, noone online? Doesnt matter, matter in fact even good for you as the grindingspots are less busy. Also the combat system is the most fluid of any MMO out there, even beating a lot of singleplayers, so yea thats probably one of BDOs biggest selling points.

Issue being the way the game is currently patched and new content released, is that most of the content has either a hard or softcap regarding your gear. Meaning that you grind your soul out of your body to not have noticeably benefits in most content, which is in my humble opinion pretty stupid in a korean grinder game. This results into the issue that you have almost no content for which you WOULD NEED the best gear in the game, making it meaningless to grind for unless you just wanna flex to the gearlets in Battlearena.

So when we just started about Battlearena, PvP, my most favourite part about the game. Beginning in year 2022, we had a big balance patch, which would make most classes pretty good in terms of PvE, making it fairly balanced to play whatever you like, without griefing your own time. BUT on the otherside overloading most of the classes with pure damage resulting in the PvP being a fiesta not compareable to anytime before. Its been like 1 1/2years by now and the Devs do little to nothing to bring PvP back in shape. 

So I am basically ending up in a grind game, in which PvE doesnt make sense after a certain point due to caps and PvP doesnt make any fun to play due to overloaded classes. I cannot recommend the game in its current state, unless you just need a big ass timesink to spend time minmaxing your gear with having in mind to not being able to use it in most scenarios.",1688379216,1688379216,False,2,0,0.529926180839538574,0,True,False,False

The two things that set Black Desert apart from the rest of the (imo) generic trash out there are:

- (Actual) realtime action combat (this is not FFXIV!), which feels responsive, flexible, and impactful (unlike every other MMO), and...

- Lifeskills, which are what really keep me playing. You can buy property, hire workers, chop down some trees, build a boat, sail the MASSIVE ocean, catch rare fish (or go diving!), fry them up (in a bunch of different ways!), and sell them on the market. All of these steps are supported by numerous interwoven systems that you are free to engage with, selectively exploit, or ignore entirely, depending on what you want to do.

If you've ever played an MMO and thought ""what if the fishing minigame was a fishing MEGAgame?"", this is where you belong.

I think I've spent more time gathering, cooking, farming, and messing around with economic systems than I have fighting things, and to be clear, I LOVE fighting things in this game (Maehwa and Corsair main, here). I just can't wait to sail more, upgrade my ship, and really get out there. There is so much to see and do!

And what a pleasure it is to SEE - the game is gorgeous. It is a joy to travel around and see the world, with all the different locations, enemies, armor and weapon designs, pets... Of special note is the ocean, with its sparkling waters and ebbing waves. Good stuff.

There are, of course, some negatives.

- UPDATE: There is now a fast travel system. I am conflicted, as I actually enjoyed my quiet travel time between cities. Now that I am able to just summon goods/items from wherever (though there are limits!), travel is far less of a thing, depending on your chosen activities.

- This is the elephant in the room: there is a cash shop, and while it's not P2W, there are certain things that you'd wish the game just... gave you (being able to call your horse from anywhere is one of them), rather than charging you for them. It's not a deal breaker for me, especially considering there is no subscription fee, and the base price is low, but it is very much present.

- Armor/weapon enhancement is done through a roulette system - some people will HATE this, but it hasn't impacted me negatively (yet) as there are clever ways around/through it. I also don't mind a gamble. YMMV.

- Dyes, on the other hand, suffer from an objectively terrible roulette system with no real alternative - buy the palette pack, engage with a pointless roulette and hope you get the right color/style, or... get used to default colors, I guess. This BADLY needs a rework.

- Sadly, you (currently) cannot dye ships, though you can dye wagons and mounts, along with pretty much everything else. I really, really hope the devs do more with ships in the future (likely?), and hopefully fix the dye system (unlikely).

- There are some economic balance issues related to harvesting and lifeskills in general. Certain prices and how profit scales likely needs to be adjusted/buffed. If you NEED to be the best and make the most money possible, and you want to do so solely via lifeskilling, this may annoy you. I simply don't care too much.

- Let me repair my Epheria Cog, or release an alternative. C'mon. I don't want a big, hulking vessel; let me enjoy my lil speedboat.

To summarize, if you're sick of garbage combat, unfulfilling lifeskills and economic systems, and P2W nonsense, Black Desert might be your jam.

EDIT: It has come to my attention that there are certain players who will criticize you for not doing things... optimally. I am not personally motivated by the ""make number go up"" brain worms, and am content to just cruise around and take in the sights while engaging in some crafting and management gameplay. It's fun. I enjoy it. I don't need the pressure. People will say I am playing the game ""wrong"", and that's okay. I am fine with that, and you should be, too.

Far too many MMOs are just click your numpad over and over until the enemy is defeated. I adore the combo system and the flashy animations and effects of the classes in game. 
But what about the game itself, Rune?
 BDO is definitely more of a solo MMO than a ""bring-all-your-friends-along-and-do-some-epic-raids"" MMO. Which some people prefer, to each their own. However, i do wish Pearl Abyss would add more quests or raids or long dungeons that i can do with my friends. Me and my friends wanted a MMO that we can progress through together, getting cool gear and getting stronger with each other but sadly BDO is not like that. It is more of a grindy, dont-think-too-much style MMO (Its also very grindy in the later levels), despite the cool combat system, which is a bit of a shame. A lot of my time is spent just doing fetch quests and talking to NPCs rather than fighting big bosses and entering massive boss areas. But overall the game is fun and the game is enjoyable, i just hope there is more multiplayer additions to the game in the future. I do still recommend this game for its stunning visuals, amazing character creator and its fluid, smooth combat system. This game is always on sale for a cheap price and it is worth getting it.

Pros:
- Always having content to do. From PVE to PVP to Life Skill to Bartering. There is always stuff to do, it all depends on what you enjoy.
- A lot of classes that each are different for your play style
- Events. This game has so many events that sometimes it feels a bit suspicious
- PVP. The PVP in this game it's pretty fun. (I am not going to get into this because it will be too much to write)
- PVE. You can play this game without the need to do PVP, and that it's a good thing for people that don't enjoy it.

Cons:
- Always having stuff to do.
- In game community. Some times reading the chat can give you a headache. But that doesn't mean that there are no good people there that you can have a normal conversation with.
- Sometimes you feel like you make no progress.
- Too much dialog sometimes for the quests. But that can also be a good thing.

I hope they add more male characters and possibly non human, it's good they added females to appease the fans who wants a waifu and have a sense of beauty to both female and male characters, but i could care less my hero looks like a K-pop model i want to be a rugged warrior who's been through hell and tells stories of legendary battles, reason i enjoy berserker. Again, not being a jerk or being someone displeasing to those type of groups its great they have these assets and go wild to make their fantasy avatar crush, good for them. Just simply appease the minority for a new project of classes for non humans for a change.

This tactic aims to inflate concurrent user numbers and create the illusion of a thriving player base. However, the game goes even further by incorporating a troubling element of gambling addiction through its item enhancement system, exploiting players' psychological vulnerabilities and keeping them engaged through addictive cycles.

By compelling players to remain logged in, even during periods of inactivity, Black Desert Online prioritises quantity over quality. The emphasis on inflated user numbers and superficial engagement metrics comes at the expense of the game's immersive and interactive nature. Instead of providing meaningful gameplay experiences, the game relies on manipulative tactics to entice players into addictive behaviour.

The item enhancement system in Black Desert Online is particularly concerning. It employs chance-based mechanics that closely resemble gambling, enticing players to invest considerable time, resources, and real-world money in pursuit of better gear or progress in the game. The addictive rush of anticipation and the constant desire for improvement replace genuine gameplay experiences, perpetuating a cycle that preys on players' addictive tendencies.

Prospective players should carefully consider the ethical implications of engaging with Black Desert Online's deceptive design. While the game may present a vibrant community, the underlying mechanics exploit psychological vulnerabilities and promote gambling addiction. It is crucial to evaluate personal gaming preferences and values before deciding whether to participate in a game that employs such manipulative tactics.",1522814034,1687775275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. I play since 2017, and have a decent amount of time invested ( 6000 hours ).
2. Speaking of invested, i started free2play and now i am at 7000$ spend, so i do know the cashshop very well.
3. I basically went through all ups and downs

First Chapter: Starting your Journey

Bdo has one, if not the best charakter creation in the Genre. Also it has now a ton of different classes and for the first playthrough it also doesn't really matter what class you pick. Just go with what you feel comfortable with. This is important if you want to have fun in the game, dont look at numbers, look at what you enjoy the most. Also take your time exploring, BDO has a great map to explore for you, dont rush and dont let anyone boost you. If you have friends who offer you to boost you so you can enjoy the ""endgame"", just decline, trust me, if you skip the ""bonding"" part, where you bond with the game and the enviroment, you will quit after a few hours.

Second Chapter: Deciding what Route to go

After you played the story and went through the the different Areas, maybe even reached lvl 60, its time for you to explore the different playstyles of BDO.
The First one would be grinding, where you will become a grinder to make your money. It basically consists of running around on the different grind spots in the game and kill mobs for hours on end. I personally also did that for about 5000 hours. Also this is the most common way to earn your money, as its the only reasonable way to inject money into the economy, as the mobs drop items you sell directly to NPC's. 

The Second playstyle would be Lifeskilling, here you make your money by everything else then grinding. For example by gathering meat or blood, these ""raw"" ingredients you then use for cooking or alchemy. These products can then be sold to the player market or later down the road a limited amount per reset to a npc. 

My advice would be to try both playstyles for a while before deciding, because once you decide you should solely focus on upgrading your gear in that field. Once you reached a certain point you CAN however start to build gear for the other playstyle. 

Third Chapter: Welcome to BDO / Cashshop

Congrats, now that you know what you want to do in the game its time for you to learn what to expect.
After the first 1000 hours you can nowadays expect to be done with the gear grind IF you decide to BUY all your gear instead of making it yourself. If you want to do it yourself, well then its an open end, you can invest 6000 hours like me and still dont have all the gear. This is also a good place to put the Cashshop. Yes there is pay2win in this game. You need a Value Pack ( basically a 15$ sub fee ) and there is the possibility to buy Cron Stones so that your gear doesnt downgrade when an enhancement failed, yes your gear can downgrade, thats the whole point of the gear system. BUT to fully maximize your account you need hundrets of thousands of dollars. So i wouldn't really say its that big of a problem. But be said there is a lot of convenient items you want to have, like maids so you dont have to leave your spot or a tent so you can repair outside of cities. If you want to truly enjoy BDO, expect to pay a few hundret bucks.

My advice, no matter how you want to play the game, be it safe or be it risky, see the game as a marathon instead of a sprint. Dont expect to be competetiv after 200 hours. You simply wont be. And thats where we come to the last Chapter.

Final Chapter: PvP

PvP is the one and only true endgame of BDO. Nowadays they capped some Nodes and Regions to fight for, so that even low gear players can ""enjoy"" the PvP aspect. But dont be fooled, you will most likely die all the time when you are new, veteran players just know the game and know the classes, so even if you have the same gear, they have the experience. Thats why i would reccommend to learn and master your class befor joining competetiv PvP.

Ah and there is also Forced open world pvp. Jup. You will die once a geared player wants your spot, get comfortable with it, thats how its always been, thats how it always will be. Thats the spirit of the Game.


I hope i could give a small summary on what to expect from the game so you can decide on your own if you want to give it a shot.",1562014609,1687427567,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the things that I disliked about this is that the chat window doesn't show up right off the bat. There's no way to interact with people until you hit level 10. Everything was so new that it had me lost and I kept wondering what to do or how to go about doing stuff. Thankfully, I had a few friends who taught me when I asked them questions. 

There's very little inventory space. I don't understand why I need to buy inventory space instead of just getting it normally. I got some boxes off twitch drops and I was worried if I would have enough inventory space to put it all in my bags? So I just left it in the mail alongside the daily stuff I get, in whatever void box storage it is. Instead of transferring it over. The game has so much stuff in it that just goes off the top of my head. With the mats and the reagents. Constant reminders in the bottom right. I guess, I'll figure it out eventually. 

Customization wise, I dislike how there's only fixed tattoos and there's nothing else possible. Wouldn't it be really cool if they let you add your own custom tattoos in it? Or let users add their own options?! Or just draw something.. Its got good customization but I feel like it could be a lot more than what it is. It feels limited for some reason, details wise. Because almost every face looks like its carved out of a mold. 

The ability to just go to the next quest guy automatically with a click is amazing. The skills and abilities are very fun to spam and use, its so much fun to beat monsters down! The graphics are fun, I love the world. The way that it looks. Although Tera's world is still my fav. this isn't bad at all. I suppose, overall I'd rate this as a 9/10 so far. The only thing other than everything that I listed is that; I dislike is that this game's mostly meant for pvp and there's no pve content like mythics and such. Additionally, no pure RP servers either and people can just hop servers like no tomorrow? But the new expansion seems to have some of that stuff with the tower monsters which I saw on yt. So I suppose, that's something. Its a pretty cool game overall and I'd definitely suggest people give it a shot. As long as you don't get bored of it, you will come to like it.

2) Let's say you are rich. You can buy your way to reach PEN (max enchant) easily. But the nature of the game is grindy af. Like, no matter how much $$$ you pour in this game, the grind never stops. It also becomes sort of a chore. I have over 250 hours in my first account (non-steam version). 

3) The skill-ceiling for this game is very high. Your success in PVP does not only rely on the rarity and enchantments of your gears. You also need fast hands to do some combos. I used to beat PEN geared players using TRI gears.

4) The only thing that I hate in this game. Their mechanic for enhancing gears. Without fail stacks, it will be forever to upgrade a gear to PEN. This fail stacking method makes me puke from dizziness. This made me quit until I decided to come back now.

- I recommend this game. So far, this is the best open world mmo that I played. The game's nature (the grind) removes the gap between rich and broke players.

so yea, there is alot of ""convenience"" you can pay for...never mind the 3 separate subscriptions, one being 30 days and the other two being 15 days, all of which are necessary for their own reasons (to be fair, you do get a lot of them for free just by playing throughout events of which there is barely ever a time that one isn't running, or just through logging in)
oh also, almost every cash shop item can be sold on the market place...some people might complain about that, because people with high disposable income can just skip any kind of grind and print money...but that also means that us lowly peasants can buy those cash shop items without paying real money for them, all you need is a bit of time spent grinding and some patience while waiting for your order to fill, since the order queue is rng based on which order gets filled first

the gear enhancement system is rough and will ruin a lot of people's experience, so i would not recommend enhancing gear yourself, but instead grinding the silver to then just buy the items off of the market place to save your sanity (the only time you ""have"" to enhance by yourself is on a season character, but the rates there are much more forgiving and very managable)

oh the grind...yea...the grind is basically the ""point"" of the game
you grind silver so you can afford better gear to grind better spots to make more silver to get better gear and the cycle continues, so i suggest trying some trial characters to see what classes you like, since you will be spending a lot of time playing them
ofcourse you're not limited to one character that you're ""stuck"" with, the max amount of slots you can have is 30 iirc and there is alot of variety in how all the classes play, so try em all and see what fits your style

lifeskills are basically an entirely different game, but they are a very nice change of pace if you're tired of grinding, atleast in my opinion

i haven't touched pvp, so there's nothing i can really add in that regard

my final advice is save yourself the headache of trying to figure out all of the games systems by yourself, unless you're a masochist, because there are plenty of helpful resources online and even class specific discord servers, if you wanna get more specific
but huge shoutout to impansy, jonlaw, biceptimus and evildousharm on youtube, great content covering pretty much everything in video form
if you're more of a reader, i'll suggest garmoth and grumpy green as general sites and bdolytics if you wanna go more in depth on lifeskilling
but besides that, play how you want...don't let anyone tell you what you should be doing, how you should be doing it or what class does x better than yours
it's a game, not a job, so who cares about the ""optimal"" strats, do whatever you enjoy the most and what won't sour the experience for you/burn you out

tl;dr:
yes, p2w exists, but is also avoidable since ""necessary"" items are given out for free regularly or can be bought for farmable currency on the in-game marketplace
for the love of god, save your sanity and DO NOT enhance your own gear, save up the silver to buy it off the marketplace
this game is about grinding...if you came here for anything else, you're in the wrong place
trial characters are your friend, try a bunch and see which classes you like most
play at your own pace and do whatever you wanna do whether that be grinding, lifeskilling or arena/large scale pvp

Heavy focus on slow burn solo grind up.  Not very much coordinated party PVE content.  The pay structure is very interesting.  No membership and you can totally game happily for free after paying the door charge and do most anything in the game.  I can't think of another title in here that will give you so many hours of enjoyment for your buck out of the gate.  Paying for stuff ends up being for two reasons: buying things you need to do the specific content you want to do most effectively and buying things to sell to other people for in game money (*cough* p2w....sorta).

Pros:
- The best combat system I have seen in a MMO
- A true sandbox, you can do whatever you want.
- Amazing craft system, gathering sources.
- You can choose how you want to make money such as crafting, gathering, farming, trading, fishing, training horse, enchantment or node(you can contract employees to work for you hahaha).
- Farming is not bad because the combat system is amazing.
- The game is 90% PVE you don't need to have a high lvl gear to enjoy the game, the game already going to give you really good gear.
- Very immersive, you will need your horse to go anywhere.
- You can have a massive ship!

Cons:
- Quest can be confusing, they can overwhelm you.
- Campaign and quest are not that good.
- Is a little bit of ""solo playing"", you don't need to have interactions with the other players, so parties are not something you are going to have, which makes the game a little bit alone sometimes.
- It takes time to understand everything from the game.


What is fake:
The cash shop will help you but is nothing insane, if you spent £50 you will have almost everything that must need. Come on, don't expect to have a game for £10 with this quality, any triple AAA game now is costing £60 so start to think this way, if you like the game support them.

Please take a look at the reviews, look how many reviews with +500 hours! if you left a bad review with +1000 hours you had ""rage quit"", nobody truly dislikes a game who has played +500 hours.

582660,140145958,76561198202197868,0,11,419,0,316,1686908400,"Black Desert Online is a game that's so shit, that it's only saving grace is its ability to basically play itself, so that I don't have to. 

It seems like every 5 seconds there's some awful cutscene, much of the early areas are populated by enemies that you can KO in a couple of hits for no exp, or enemies that you'll have to fight for several minutes on end, and not get enough exp to make up for the time you spent mauling them. These enemies will usually be within about 20 feet of each other, so you'll have no problem seeing what I mean. 

So the classes in this game... it's an MMORPG, and like most, it has classes. The classes can be cool, but they're gender locked. Want to be a brawler who summons clones and punches with fire? Too bad, you wanted to play as a woman, that means you're relegated to the less brutal but more water inclined punching class. Oh, you wanted to be a caster? I hope you like cc, because if you chose to play as a fem character, you don't get to be a big aoe burst class, you get to be a witch, who still does damage (though, less, and with a focus on cc), but for some reason there's a distinction between that and a wizard. 

Even when the game tries to include class counterparts for both sexes, you can't just play the same thing, and that's so wild lol. It takes more time, effort, and money to do that, than just working on rigging the animations to both sexes. There's no reason there can't be male pirates, there's no reason there can't be female sages. It's a counter-intuitive, archaic, unnecessary system that just makes you feel like the devs couldn't be bothered to make something and let people enjoy it. 

Speaking of gender locked classes, they're almost stereotypical, imo. All the m classes are these big, burly, fully clothed or geared characters, and all the f characters might as well be buck naked, chest exposed, with no pants or the tiniest miniskirt you've ever seen, always wearing stiletto heels, tons of exposed skin, gratuitous jiggle physics... you get the idea. I don't mind sexy outfits in games, and when there's the option, I certainly don't mind picking them up, sometimes... but when the game sets this expectation of you being, by default, super exposed eye candy who can't even just play the same classes as the m classes, it just feels really strange, and I'm not into it. 

I think it'd be really cool if both playable sexes could be whatever class tbh, not just f characters getting to be m classes, but m characters getting to be f classes. Just having that option would be cool. I'm a woman, and I like playing as women in games, too, but it just feels like this game sets up a really strange sort of stereotype right from the beginning, and if you don't believe me, check out the official class trailers on YouTube, you'll see the sort of thing I mean. 

As far as the rest of the game goes... there's a mandatory tutorial in the beginning that feels 1000x times longer than it actually is because it could have just been a skippable cutscene, but instead opted to be a series of poorly written, short, cutscenes with forced gameplay segments between them to try to make you pay attention to the shitty cutscenes. Once you get into the world, there's gonna be even more. If you don't enjoy the dialogue, get ready, there will be lots more. 

At least after the tutorial, some of it is able to be skipped.

Fun fact about the tutorial, btw, I literally couldn't alt f4 to close it. The developers are so hellbent on making you watch their cutscenes, that even using alt f4 to close the game will prompt a little message in the upper right hand corner of the screen, reminding you that you cannot skip cutscenes, even when you aren't watching one lol.

Speaking of dialogue, the game will ask what language you want characters to speak, but apparently the only dialogue setting that actually sticks is the subtitles, so at least the game is playable, but it would honestly be better if it wasn't lmao, it just sucks.

Thankfully, there's a keybind that's active by default (at least on keyboard) that just lets your character automatically move around and go from quest obj to quest obj, and lets you ignore the part where you actually have to figure out where you're going... not that it's overly difficult, but the more you play, the more you just go 'please, take the wheel, get me out of here, I'd rather play something else.' 

The game's UI is also pretty overwhelming, with ads coming up, lots of buttons, too many menus, and the menus themselves being overly cluttered, disorganized, and frankly, the only part of the game that actually feels like it should have had a tutorial. Ironically, it seems to be the only part of the game, as far as I can tell, that doesn't have one. 

The size of this game's world is pretty astounding. It's pretty big tbh, but there's nothing to do there. The big appeal of this game, as far as I can tell, is that it's designed to be like older MMOs, where there's big, open, areas... filled with enemies to farm kills from, but that's about it. There's really not much in the way of content diversity. You do the story, or you kill stuff in the open world. For how huge the world is, and how much of an emphasis the game's developers clearly put on combat, you would think that there'd be more types of content, but... nope, that's about it. You're either dealing with the story, or this. The game's big, and it's pretty, but there's nothing to really do unless you like this sort of thing (which I do, but I don't think it hurts to have some variety). In that sense, it's not unlike Guild Wars 2, but even GW2 has stuff going on in the world. 

For my fellow FFXIV players, it's basically meant to be going for the same style of gameplay/game that Eureka was going for, in Stormblood.

Small complaint on the character creation front, too, and this doesn't affect the rest of the game at all... but, for some reason, you can manually select a custom color for your hair, but not for your eyes. Like, you can get any color you want for your hair, but your eyes are given the choice between seemingly supernatural neon, pale brown, or dark blues/black. Really odd that you can't just pick more natural looking colors for your eyes, but your hair can be pretty much any absurd color that you probably won't end up choosing. 

Another nitpick would be that you don't have any in-game options for reporting toxicity or chat spamming. For some reason, a persistently online, social, experience doesn't really give you the ability to let a moderation team know when people are just being huge assholes in the chat. 

Overall, the game's pretty, but it's absolute shit imo. The level layouts in my experience so far have been pretty awful, enemies are either too easy or too difficult, while not rewarding enough exp for fighting pretty much anything beyond level 8 or 9, it seems like the devs really want to objectify and stereotype based on gender, so there's that, too, I guess? Not really a game I would recommend, and I honestly can't wait to uninstall it after I post this review. I just wish I could get my money back lol.

I would like to edit this review to add in, after the fact, that this game has no fast travel system. If you want to go anywhere that isn't right where your character is, you have to either manually walk there, or automate some kind of path and auto walk while you get up and do something else. 

Just to give an example of how big this game's world is, and what it's like to have no fast travel system of any kind, I decided to use the auto walk feature to get from one starting area to the next. This meant no combat, no stopping, no getting sidetracked, just going until I got to my destination. To get from one starting area to the next, it took about 30 minutes without any stopping, getting lost, drawing aggro and fighting, etc.

Was only willing to play this for the 3vs3 PVP with equalized gear because the combat system is one of the best. Well it turns out that to reach 60 you need to swipe your credit card because the enchant rate is so low that you can't even do it by simply purchasing Marketplace (auction house) items. All this in a ""Novice"" server where its supposed to be easier. 

After so many years there are still a lot of bugged quests that you can't even progress without watching youtube guides, which is complete bullshit. You receive a lot of materials you don't have any clue about without again, watching youtube videos. Basically you have to watch a video guide even for the interface because its not intuitive AT ALL. 

Pet system is completely missleading, no description of which pet combinations/skills are possible.
Mouting system is such a headache and with such little information I prefer walking around everywhere. 

I wanted to grind to 60 by killing mobs and after reading some online guides it turns out if you want to do it efficiently you need to build yourself a Camp, for which you need high level collection skills. Bro wtf, do I need to have a masters degree in order to play this? 

Steamcharts shows around 20k players, from which a big percentage of them has paid thousands of $ and the other part is F2P players that have played since the beginning. So if you want to throw money down the train play this. 

Open world pvp isn't worth it at all, you get 1 shot while trying to farm your way to 60... and you lose XP which you can only regain 100% of lost XP by... yeah you guessed it, using a PAID item from the pearl shop... disgusting. 

So at some point you will have to spend money on at least 1 of these topics:
- storage expansion, both warehouse and character inventory... Its complete bullshit not having SHARED PURCHASED inventory slots for ALL characters, it only works for the one you have now. 
- increase % on enchantment rate
- pet / mounts
- skins (which give you stats BTW)
- revival to avoid losing EXP

First things first, this game is an absolute blast! The world of Black Desert Online is like a breathtaking painting come to life. Seriously, the graphics are drool-worthy. Whether you're exploring the dense forests or trudging through the scorching deserts, the attention to detail is mind-blowing. And don't even get me started on the character customization! I swear, I spent more time designing my virtual alter ego than I did on my last haircut.

Now, let's talk about the combat. Oh boy, it's a wild ride! This ain't your typical point-and-click MMO combat, my friends. No sir, Black Desert Online offers a fast-paced and action-packed system that gets your heart pumping. You'll be dodging, slashing, and casting spells with such fluidity that it feels like you're in an epic martial arts movie. The combos you can pull off are straight-up satisfying, and decimating mobs of enemies never gets old.

But hey, let's not forget about the grind. Yes, the dreaded grind. Black Desert Online has a reputation for being a bit of a grindfest, and I can't deny it. If you're looking for instant gratification, this might not be your cup of tea. Leveling up and getting better gear requires some serious dedication and a truckload of patience. You'll find yourself running the same quests and killing the same monsters over and over again. It can feel like a never-ending loop at times, and it's not everyone's cup of tea.

Speaking of loops, let's talk about the learning curve. Brace yourself, my fellow newcomers, because Black Desert Online doesn't hold your hand. Nope, it throws you into the deep end of the pool and expects you to swim. The lack of proper tutorials and guidance can be frustrating, especially for MMO rookies like myself. Figuring out the intricate systems and mechanics can feel like deciphering hieroglyphics. I had to consult online guides and watch countless YouTube tutorials just to grasp the basics. It's a steep learning curve, my friends, so be prepared.

Despite these bumps in the road, Black Desert Online is a game I can't seem to put down. The breathtaking world, the exhilarating combat, and the endless possibilities keep me coming back for more. Yes, it has its flaws, and the grind can feel like a chore. But if you're willing to dive headfirst into an immersive and visually stunning MMO adventure, Black Desert Online will sweep you off your feet and take you on a wild ride.

Its enjoyable for both hardcore and committed players as well as casual and laid-back players. With options for pvp, pve, and lifeskilling, BDO offers many different options of play for everyone. The customization in the game is phenomenal, probably the best in any mmo I've played both new and old, with sliders for every choice and full customization for characters/classes. You'll never not have something to do. However, with all the good things in the game come not-so-good things. The grind to be relevant for pvp and guild wars is never-ending. Enhancing and drops/loot are completely rng based, with enhancing having low percentage success around 1% - 5% for the gear that makes you relevant with the breaking or degrading of certain equipment making the grind never-ending and expensive. For those interested in an engaging and interesting story, BDO has changed and retconned many things over the years overall making the story deeper and more interesting, however not better than its other mmo counterparts. The story quests are irrelevant to the overall gameplay and can easily be speedran and rushed to level characters.
Pros:
- Amazing customization 
- Many different class options with more coming each year
- Fun and diverse pvp and pve
- Diverse life skills and afk life skilling
- Beautiful environment/scenery as well as ability effects 
- Seasonal events, outfits, and areas
- Fun to use classes and abilities 
- Never-ending grind
- Decent Story
Cons:
-Pvp is locked by level which is easy to get however gear is important and it takes thousands of hours or insane luck to even get 1 piece of gear that would be considered decent for pvp.
- Everything is rng based from drops to enhancing
- Getting to lvl 60 is easy but everything after that take hours upon hours of endless grinding
- Not quite pay to win but very much pay for quality of life
- A lot of spots are highly contested by very high geared players and there isnt much option other than server swapping to be able to defeat mobs without threat of pvp
- Pvp is active everywhere aside from cities so once you are of level to pvp you either have to server swap or wait for people to leave.
-Once you get to a certain level and gear score you are limited on places to farm exp and money and will be there for hundreds or thousands of hours in hopes of a singular good drop.
- High chance of being caught in a cycle of grind, buy item, enhance item, break item while enhancing, lose mind, then repeat.
I have 11k hours in the game and have played periodically over the past 4 years and the game is more of a grind than any other mmo I have played. It's very easy to get burnt out once you finish main quests and have only gear score and level to worry about. However, the game looks great and can be fun when you get past the tryhard grind of it.

BDO Is a game you can pickup after leaving for a few months and get back into with the benefit of being gifted something for coming back and the additional benefit of picking up what you haven’t collected from the last time you logged in. If you want a well-paced MMORPG I whole heartedly encourage you to play this game. You won’t be disappointed if you like a bit of everything and don’t like being forced into a specific style of game play. You can play casually or competitively make friends and enemies become trader to the stars or just gain fame by posting selfies in the gallery. BDO is for want of a better word Awesome!
I can't give much more of an in depth review as the whole game is just too big and you need more space to give a justified review explaining everything. Best thing about the game is no loading times when travelling around the map. 

[h1]Characters[/h1]

There are a number of classes, some which are female only so at some point in the future we expect to eventually get their male counterpart which appears to be the MO of this game. You have a number of free character slots to begin with and with a little patience you can expand that to the maximum number of characters you have access to. Instead of youtubing what the most powerful class, I would recommend picking one you like the look of and working on levelling this. 
Some classes are easier to fight with than others as they have bind-able special skills which can be linked to create devastating attacks PVP or PVE.
The character creation tool of this game is about as good as the Sims one if not better. With the new graphical render engine the level of realism to the overall look of the characters is less plastic and more in line with the fantasy style. The attention to detail is pretty standard now but when this game originally dropped it was unprecedented. 

[h1]Anti Cheat[/h1]
This is a controversial part of the game and will be the deciding factor for most players as the service which is installed can be likened to a rootkit which will monitor your activities whilst the game is running so I’d advise not to log into any websites you wouldn’t mind any complete stranger logging into on your behalf because it’s NOT CRYSTAL CLEAR to what extent this anti cheat software is capable of but it will kill known tasks of software which can be used to inspect processes used for monitoring memory (which is the primary use of any cheat software but does not discriminate so you can’t run Microsoft process monitor (procmon)).
I don’t run Windows under an admin account and would never recommend any one else does or disable UAC for that matter. BDO insists that I do every time I run it to be able to use this anti cheat (which I don’t let it) You can quite simply run the black desert launcher with compatibility mode run as invoker enabled which will allow the game to run under the current account. This will limit the capabilities of the software.

[h1]Community[/h1]
I like this game a lot, ultimately the community makes the game live or die. There is a huge following but you can’t count the following on one set of servers alone. The servers are split between Console, Steam and non Steam versions of the same game so you won’t get an idea unless you tally up everything.  I’m not an ambassador to the game at all but I read and follow the general community and in some countries the BDO ethos is not nice or the local game chat has been likened to shear filth. I’m hoping that the new blood acquired from console players will bring a new lease of life to the game.

[h1]Servers[/h1]
In all the time I’ve played this game I’ve only once been unable to enter the game and the fix was to restart the computer to pick up a steam update. The game triumphs above any other MMORPG in that you only wait to load if you are jumping around the map from city to city. This has kind of been fixed now by the addition of the Magnus Questline. The Magnus allows fast travel between all the relams and you just need to jump into a well :)

Not including the Sea which can be navigated for free by hopping on board a trade ship bound for the other side of the map (~15 Mins travel time IRL) if you haven’t crafted your own boat and been sunk mid way through your voyage. So you never see a loading screen unless you are entering a dungeon or a PVP battle event.

[h1]Media/GFX[/h1]
The game has gone through a few enhancements over the years it’s been out for English speakers. The last one being the music which was remastered with a full orchestra soundtrack and these where brand new tracks not just re-hashed old ones which to be honest sounded like orchestral tracks to begin with. The graphics renderer had an overhaul too which added a new level of realism in the form of a physical based renderer. Don’t be put off by this game assuming it requires a beast of a machine as it is designed to run on just about any Windows machine which is no mean feat. In the time I’ve been playing there have been four additional characters released and four new areas (one under water) which still don’t open the whole map up from its fog of war look. 

[h1]Money[/h1] (not real)
The central market economy in BDO fluctuates like the wind depending on events which are running all the time. The market has been overhauled over the last year or so to rate control your purchasing. You will find acquiring wealth in the game quite simple once you master trade nodes and workers. You can quest which is good for levelling your current class and learning about the world you are playing in. You’ll learn how to level up your gear, which you won’t be able to do without the knowledge so you will need to quest. Some gear can be acquired through quests and levelled up through quests to the max. 

[h1]Gear and levelling [/h1]
You have three weapon traits, Primary offensive. Secondary Offensive/Defensive and the last weapon is for your Awakening skill which you have a quest path for at level 56. Some classes have a personal mount. Some have a support spirit (of sorts). Accessories like rings and necklaces can either be quested for or enhanced through world NPCs then there is armour which will buff different attacking aspects depending on the variants of armour you chose.
Levelling gear is done with similar items of gear or through the use of black stones. Different black stone varieties can be acquired through gathering, questing, PVE or purchased from the central market. Using your processing skills will allow you to craft lower grade black stones into higher grade Black stones for the enhancement of higher grade equipment or armour. It’s quicker to get the silver and buy the stones specifically for your enhancement runs.
Enhancements can be set to guarantee the enhancement of the equipment but at the cost of reducing the durability of said equipment (usually from %100 to %0 at higher grades). For accessories this is dangerous as you can quite easily lose a high levelled accessory to a failed enhancement. For accessories you can use cron stones which will not allow the accessory to be destroyed after a failed enhancement. For weapons and armour you will just lose durability and then need to either buy the same weapon or armour piece for a blacksmith/repair NPC to then recover the durability. 
Recently Stable owners have been given the ability to Repair equipment which is more for convenience as you would find yourself a long way between a central market NPC or blacksmith NPC.
Enhancements can be gambled on with the enhancement level you gain from a failed enhancement. There are so many youtube videos which explain the enhancement process. If that wasn’t enough equipment has three grades on top of the enhancement process, Green, Blue and Yellow (Yellow being the strongest grade).",1570981135,1686855754,True,1,0,0.475604772567749023,0,True,False,False

At first this game was great, ahead of its time compared to other popular MMOs on release, visually stunning and really made you feel immersed in the environment it provided. However, now its just a former husk of what it once was, vomiting out poorly made content in hopes of keeping its current player based entertained long enough for them to shove a shiny new cash shop item in your face for you to buy to ""enhance"" your experience.

I'll break this game down into each of its sub sections and my thoughts and experiences on it so far:

Combat: The holy grail and only reason its worth playing, but if you're just here for PVE then its boils down to a hack and slash item farming simulator with disappointing, laggy and underwhelming boss fights. The best description I can give it is ""It sounds way cooler than it really is."" If you're here for PVP, well then you're in for a treat, but only if you're willing to lower your graphics down to RuneScape levels of quality so that your FPS is high enough to register your damage and keep track of the 50 players on screen throwing flashy AOEs around (If you're brave enough to leave Player affects on). In 1v1 encounters it feels and plays like a fighting game, think Naruto Shippuden meets Streetfighter, assuming you're at the same Gear Score and Skill level as your opponent, else its just you trying to avoid an invulnerable Panzer tank firing nuclear missiles at you while it de-syncs towards you at the speed of light.

Story: Its horrid. So much so that I've lost count of how many times they've changed it to try to make it interesting. In the newer story content it feels like they're trying to do more than the game engine will allow and some interactions just feel off. The English Dub is awful and feels like you're watching a bad Kungfu movie from the 90s. Because someone at Pearl Abyss thought it would be a good idea to give ASIAN CHARACTERS FULL ON SOUTHERN AMERICAN ACCENTS FOR SOME STUPID REASON. Its not memorable at all and you'll most likely be skipping your way through it to get to the ""mid to late game"".

Progression: This right here is most likely going to be the reason you'll quit the game entirely. Be it Combat or LifeSkills, either way its slow, so slow that having something on the side to keep you from falling asleep while grinding is mandatory at this point. So I hope you still have a netflix sub and a series on your watch list to keep your brain functioning while you run around the same rotations for 1-6 hours over and over again, day after day. Sure the game does give new players a headstart with the season servers and basically free accessories, capotias, T8 horses and MULTIPLE BATTLE PASSES (yes this is a thing because money), but really it only gets your gear score high enough to START the ENTRY LEVEL end game grinds. Expect to be farming for 3-6 months (depending on your RNG and drop rates) before you can even consider taking on vet players. And don't even get me started on Upgrading Gear. Its like gambling, sitting at a slot machine hoping you can succeed with that >5% chance for enhancement, but if you're willing to spend real money on pearl shop costumes to convert them to cron stones you can just slam your face on the enhance button without having to worry about YOUR GEAR DOWNGRADING WHEN IT FAILS. This is one of the many ""Pay to Win"" features of this game and anyone who says this game isn't pay to win is smoking unnecessary amounts of copium.

Cash Shop: I'm not going to lie here, the costumes are dope. But EVERYTHING in the cash shop is overpriced. To a point were you could realistically find yourself wondering if you should really be buying this costume or instead spend the same amount on one of the new AAA games that got released. Its predatory. And there are so many ""pay for convenience"" items that are so beneficial that the game feels like you're at a disadvantage without them. They created problems and are selling the solutions. Ofc you could go full Free to Play but expect your progression to take longer than someone with an unfathomable amount of credit card debt.

Gameplay: In order to do anything the ""correct"" way without missing something, you'll need a guide. A guide for levelling, a guide for gear depending on which class you choose, a guide for crystal sets, a guide for best farming rotations, a guide for worker empire setups, a guide for QUESTING, a guide for crafting, a guide for cooking, a guide for pvp match-ups, a guide for log books, a guide for navigating through the desert...the list goes on and on. I've taken so many people through the new player experience and it feels like explaining an encyclopedia to a preschooler. And I know it might sound appealing to dumbasses who like to gatekeep games and topics that require textbooks to understand, but its just exhausting. Its a constant back and forth of ""How do I do this"" and ""Where do I find that"". 

Community: Drama, harassment, hate, crybabies, racists, sexism, discrimination, false accusations and any other ""isms"" you'd experience from a typical bronze league of legends match. PVP means conflict. And because its a ""PVP game"" tech support will refuse to help you because ""they can't interfere with pvp related issues"". Even if someone is constantly harassing you or making racist remarks they wont do anything about it. Its ""part of the game"". I've seen so many degenerates saying things that would put them on a watchlist if they said it in public. So brace for degeneracy. Not to mention the game is region locked so 90% of the time you're going to be interacting with someone who can't speak English and is using google translate to swear at you because you stole their rotation.

This game isn't a game. Its a job. If you're looking for something casual you're in the wrong place. And fully expect to have to replace your GPU or entire Gaming laptop at some point from having to leave this game running overnight for some activities. 

It's not worth it.

I would like to say that since 2017 I have about 500 hours total into the game (The game moved to steam at some point) and I only payed the base price which was around 10$ at the time. I have never spent any extra money in this game.

Story is really bad, but without spending any money you can easily make gear that will get you all around the world and experience combat which is really fun.

If that gets boring, life skills are cool, You can buy and customise houses and ships to sail the sea.

The combat really sets this game apart as it is by far the best in any MMO game I have ever played. Truly exciting and gets better the more you understand it.

The only thing I can say is the combat is pretty damn good. Only that you won't be doing too much of that.

I'm not gonna point out the same things as everyone else but I will give my two cents for one thing that really annoys me - the globalisation of your character progress. After returning from a really long hiatus I wanted to start fresh, but that's not a possibility. Once content is done it's done. Sure you can level characters individually but you won't get anything new out of it, like achievements or titles. Your mounts, pets, titles are all shared across characters. And that's extremely boring for someone who likes to have multiple characters in MMOs. I also get overwhelmed by notifications after logging in, stuff just gets thrown at you without much rhyme or reason. That and the dreadfully boring ""go from point a to point b"" quests aren't worth my time.

Since it was bought by the developer i noticed a shift in prices and rewards. a specific example; we were given a scroll (about 4 months back) that said you could send Exp and Combat Exp to another character... it never had on the scroll that it would [b]SWAPPED[/b] exp. I used the scroll and bricked my character(not sure how many others did so) when i asked for a reversal (i didn't even want the scroll back i just wanted the characters swapped back) i was told to kick rocks and wait for it come out on the shop (fair I technically fucked up).... which it is at a whooping 100 USD

considering how long I've played you could imagine why i wouldn't want to play anymore have getting told ""F"" you by the game 3 times... the game feels predatory for transactions now...sure i have alts, and they are all 60+ but i can't help but feel cheated, i mean why give a scroll that Exchanges exp? just seems dumb in practice, especially when everything else functions on combining instead of swapping (they sell life scrolls that allow you to send from one character to another)

I feel like a lot has just become cash grabs, for a dying mmo. Spare yourselves


Greetings Developer,
 
While you maintain your statement, as we discussed VIA email before, i maintain my statement. The scroll in question did not list that it ""swapped"" exp, merely that moved exp from one character to the next or ""transferred Combat EXP from current character to target character"". Even if it was an error on my part I asked to be able to purchase or just have another scroll to swap my character's back. Instead of maybe seeing my mistake or potentially yours i was told id have to wait and that i was now stuck that way. I do not see the point in you re-iterating this message, i had already mentioned that i had reached out to the help line and how unsatisfactory it was. this isn't a plea for something this is a warning to others.

Kind regards.

That response aside, there has been progress in the game since the dev's have bought it. there's been some great changes but its still pretty cash shop intensive. So read carefully when you use items you get for free and enjoy. on an interesting note i noticed they changed how the scrolls are named since i played... wonder what caused that.",1641848835,1685852682,False,1,0,0.507966279983520508,0,True,False,False

Want to be limited on everything you do?

Pros:
looks can be deceiving 
the crafting and harvesting system is one the best in mmo's
mounts include horses , wagons, boats!
very robust economy



cons:

So much is limited in this game
The following are limited :

inventory
life xp
skill xp
combat xp
weight
bank storage
beauty salon
barter points

so you have to buy convenience packs



OVERALL:

7/10 only thing good is the graphics, harvesting, and fishing 😂

Sure you can spend money to get things super fast, but you can just legit get everything without spending money. Unless of course you want one of those premium costumes (sometimes you can get them in events) or artisans. You can also craft some costumes too which is better than nothing honestly.

Side notes: 
If you are complaining about grinding to get 1 item or money how is it any different from doing 1 dungeon for hours to get 1 item? cough cough [strike]WOW[/strike] cough. Maybe this type of game is just not for you? I find it relaxing to just grind for few hours with occasional challenger to take my spot or ppl asking to go grind with them on harder spot.

(Also i have said it above that you need a lot of time do do anything but it doesn't mean you have to play 12h a day as ppl are saying in other reviews. With gear you get easily and for free at season you can get around 300kk-500kk money in 3h-4h grind. Are you so impatient that you want to be given BIS after playing 5h in mmorpg? Better go play minecraft and just spawn yourself some diamonds.)

As for toxic community ofc there is a toxic part of the community and there is the not so toxic part as in any other online game. If you are complaining about that have you ever played any other online game? CS? LOL? 
(Well if you did run into only toxic ppl and griefers that's just unlucky. I personally consider myself part of the not toxic community and i always try to help others. MMOs are better together.)

Also i have no idea what are ppl talking about having issues with language settings i have never had any problem with that and i recommended this game to 5 friend and as far as i know non had such issues smh. I do get very rarely some setting changed after patch but it's mostly things like fullscreen going windowed.",1685258196,1685258196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
PC optimization is fine for my end. (Things looks a lot prettier on ultra settings but it's too heavy for my pc ;v;) 
Graphic is not too bad.
The stories and missions are fine. 
Combat system not too bad. 
I also happen to like the freedom in character customization. 
It has some depth on managing a lot of things like skills, horses, trading, workers, raw materials production and etc.

Cons:
I feels like the enhancement for equipment is the only most important thing that needs to be grind and it's not easy. 
It can be frustrating sometimes.

Conclusion:
I am not sure about if you can actually top up some money to get ""pre-made"" enhanced equipment on the market, if it's available. If you can do that, that might actually be the only part that considered Pay-to-Win element. Overall, It's okay to play as a normal rpg game and also play it with your friends, without spending a dime like me.

This game is amazing and fun and will pull you right in. However, it takes a lot of time to really get results and there are a lot of in game purchases that help things go along. I played this game in November 2020 with over 850 hours at the time. I spent upwards of $500 dollars and had numerous characters, billions of dollars, a large collection of items, armor, gear, etc. I'd devoted heavily to the game despite not having much money IRL. I recently returned to this game and found I'd lost all of my account stuff as they had changed companies and deleted everything. I reported this to the customer service requesting some compensation for the loss as I'd been in the process of moving at the time of the transfer and was unaware of losing my account. The customer service basically informed me they wouldn't do anything to help and it was tough luck. I was extremely upset as they could have done something to assist me in restarting. Aside from this incident, the game itself is very fun with constant updates and an active GM staff. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in fast paced combination combat and in-depth life skills.

For the others that can buy things and spend on the game there is a ton of stuff to make your playtime better! When you buy things, it's easy to understand even for the less tech savvy people. 

The game has so many places to get answers to your questions regarding quests and things that are game related that makes it more enjoyable as well. 

The general chat is less desirable some hours but gets better as you play. If you don't want to read it you just pop another chat up and you don't see it. 

Customizing your character is out of this world in depth. I was astonished and amazed at how many things you have control over as far as your characters looks. If you don't know what you want, there is something for that too. There's a whole database of previously done character looks to choose from for each type. 

There is a ton of content for every level and play style. If you want to craft you can. If you want to fight things you can. If you want to tame horses you can. If you like farming stuff there's that too. There's something for everyone and every mood. You can also get and decorate your houses. You can have a house in every city. It's neat.

In the beginning, yea we had alot of toxicity and there was a bad community and alot of bugs. But they've smoothed so much out. There is a dedicated updates every week, new content, new classes alllllllll the time. Endless things to do. There is a dedicated community that keeps me coming back. I would say that over time this game has become one of the best mmorpgs to play. The ""pay to win"" aspect is heavily outweighed by the endless free items and gear given out regularly. The pay to win issue has been always relevant for the games growth... as any MMO. But they've been able to shift it in an angle that isn't directly affiliated with being better as compared to before. I will admit that when it was first released and within the first few years it definitely was considered more ""Pay to win"" but id say now, its not nearly as much and it makes sense. I mean if we wanna compare to things like Lost Ark; Atleast we dont have the ability to literally Buy gear score... just saying :) 

Above that, there is PVP, PVE content alike. I feel like this stuff hardly ever gets spoken about for some reason. But the PVE content is truly incredible. Its widespread and can have you going for a long time. To give some examples; Housing - You can do so much customisation with your own house that it would interest any UWU boy or girl to wanna decorate for hours on end. 

Taming/breeding- for those peeps out there that love training and horses and stuff

cooking- Literally endless recipes and like u could literally learn some stuff ofr ur own knowledge and kitchen because it does have some legit recipes just sayinggggggg

crafting/processing- i mean look this one up yourself, its pretty endless

Sailing or fishing- So yeah this is a whole category of its own btu this game got its own whole ass ocean and underwater exploration and fish u can fish and eat and also big sea monsters u can hunt , u can also get lost in teh sea and it can be scaryyy yup 

I didnt even name all of em because im not big on PVE in general but u can see this game somehow enticed me to enjoy PVE 

PVP- The pvp is pretty sick. There is no comparison to any game rn when it comes to the fast pase action combat. Idc what anyone says because ive played em alll okay. Bdo action combat is unmatched and it realy shows in PVP. 

anywayss, yeah there is some cons about this game and id say it would be time investment (LOL at almost 24k hours)but keep in mind most of its AFK so thats another thing to be aware. Think of old MMO where you would leave shop overnight and make money; instead u leave ur character to do processing or do fish and make money. And that's why u seen alot of hours.

Black Desert is a rather complex and involved game in some ways but overly simple with not much depth on the surface. As I once described to a friend, ""it doesn't have much depth, but a LOT of breadth.""

However, recently Pearl Abyss took over international publishing of their own game, removing Kakao Games, which has turned out to be a very good thing. It's taken a while to show, but Pearl Abyss is (albeit slowly) repairing and upgrading their game massively. My TL;DR take is, this is a great time to be a new or returning player to BDO, as (at the time of writing) there's a new area being released within a couple months and a lot of planned upgrades to the core game play, such as the entire original main story quest is supposed to receive actual voice acting and better cut scenes. There's already a sample of this out for the original initial area (Balenos). PA is constantly giving out cash shop items, at least 2 to 3 times more than Kakao ever did. Constant stream of events with actually decent items in them. Decent items in every Season's free rewards. Etc.

Now, to address the elephant in the Lily. Pay to Win. Black Desert has for some time, and still often faces, recurring accusations of pay to win. Now for the purposes of my own review, I am solely going to be dealing with this concept as ""paying for something not available to be acquired in game without a cash purchase and/or providing an advantage exclusively through cash purchase."" Recently in an argument in the new player group in game, someone brought up an example that when I thought it through, I thought was the PERFECT example despite the fact they used it to prove the opposite point.

Their example was that: If two players start the game at the same time but one pays cash while the other does not and that cash outlay provides an advantage, that's a problem. Well, actually. *Nerd glasses push.* Here's the problem with that assessment, people paying money into games often do so to compensate for lack of time, so a person paying money might say only play BDO actively for maybe 30 hours a week? Say, 3 hours a day during work days, 7 to 8 hours a day on their day off. This does not include afk times for horse training, fishing, etc. Now let's say the other guy is a hard core gamer with no life. He drops 80 hours active game play a week (again, not including afk timers, we'll just presume both have about equal afk times or neither afks because new and don't know that's a thing).

Now, following my example above and that working person with money has a near infinite bank pool of free cash to spend on the game, he will indeed pull a brief advantage with costume, underwear and tent buffs. Very likely, he'll also buy inventory space, weight limit space and possibly even bank space in a couple of cities. However, presuming they started at the beginning of a season, the gamer will quickly be done with his season before the other guy. He'll be learning about life skilling earlier, how to gain energy and contribution. How to use contribution to expand bank slots. How to do the Magnus quest to gain access to every bank in the game. How to acquire and use workers. Where the best spots are to grind for silver. That he can buy his own costumes off the Central Market. Which quest provides the free tent. That PA will give out undies eventually if he's patient. By end of Season, the gamer will likely have a rather large advantage over his ""p2w"" friend in the ways of knowledge and advancement in the game, not to mention acquiring and having spent his time grinding for the materials he'll need for enhancing his gear up.

""But Ashi, what about crons? You literally buy costumes for crons & you HAVE to have crons for enhancing your gear!!!!"" They can be bought from a vendor? Sure, it's cheaper if you put a buy order for costumes on the market to get those crons which by implication makes it ""p2w"" because someone has to buy those costumes to fill those orders. I have 3 costume boxes from give away's in my bank I haven't used yet & get literal thousands of crons from just PA give away's, without even going to bosses which literally everyone does. (World Bosses are known for giving out crons). So, why are you complaining about supporting a p2w model that even the whales don't really support much anymore? Go buy them from the vendor or wait for them from the game.

The biggest problem is that the average player in BDO wants to ""Rush to end game."" Well, end game started when you turned it on, more or less. Black Desert Online is a Marathon, not a race. There is no ""end of the game"" per se, not really. You can hit a point where progression is pointless, yes. But then new content will come out and change that goal post. Take your time, smell some Silver Azaleas along the way and have fun, it's just a game.",1683497841,1683497841,True,3,0,0.534336745738983154,0,True,False,False

As a fan of sandbox MMOs, I appreciate BDO's open-world approach to gameplay, offering a variety of in-game activities. However, the game's questing system leaves much to be desired, feeling rather dull compared to the rest of the game.

Having played other MMOs like Lineage 2, WoW, Aion, and GW2, I can say that BDO's graphics and performance are top-notch, although they require a powerful computer to experience fully. The game's community can be a mixed bag, with friendly and helpful guild members and Discord users, but in-game interactions are often marred by toxicity.

As a complex and deep game, BDO's learning curve can be quite steep, requiring dedication and motivation to master its mechanics and systems. However, once you get the hang of it, the class combos and skills make for an addictive gaming experience.

The developers' commitment to the game is evident through their weekly updates and the Global Labs test server. While BDO initially had a pay-to-win reputation, it has since evolved to require minimal cash shop investments. The tent is a prime example of a useful in-game purchase. However, the game's enchantment system can be frustratingly luck-based, and spending money on additional attempts may only lead to more frustration.

Overall, Black Desert Online offers an engaging and addictive sandbox MMO experience, with exceptional graphics, a variety of in-game activities, and consistent developer support. While the questing system and community interactions could use some improvement, BDO remains a rewarding game for those willing to invest the time and effort to learn its intricacies.",1683481314,1683481314,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Things that could be fixed

-Enhancing. This whole system in my opinion is made to be a frustrating as possible so you either PTW your enhancements with cron stones or gamble hundreds of hours away with no guarantee of success. There is no point playing a game that actively punishes you for trying to get better gear. People will say just buy your gear - someone still has to enhance it.

-PVP. Where to start. Open world pvp suck because if you are a new player you will get bullied anytime someone gets bored and wants your spot. If someone with better gear than you picks a fight you will lose every time. The pvp in this game would be amazing if you could actually experience it. The easy solution would be to make servers with gear equalized open worlds for people that actually want to fight other people.

-Grinding. I understand they don't want us to get done with this game quickly but holy shit is this game a time sink. you can see my hours at the time of posting this, I have 273 ap 355 dp. That is barely good enough to even start touching the world at large. Id be looking at probably another 3000 hours to get into anything close to end game gear. There are long games and then there are games that are a second job: this one is one of them.

I'll add that the actual variety of grind spots at most levels is unfortunately low. most spots are the same thing in a different landscape and its a shame.

-Life Skills. I'll keep this section short. If you are going to have life skills make them engaging and actually make the money comparable to running in a circle killing things. Nothing is worse than watching a bar tick down so you can watch another bar tick down (and so on and so forth)

-PTW. people call it ""pay for convenience"" you can call an apple an orange but it's still an apple. 
examples: Premium Tent, outfits for silver, outfits extraction (and buffs), character slots, character weight, energy potions, nader's band, maids, horn/flute, inventory slots, pets, fairies etc

TLDR. Don't play this game as a new player. The time investment to fun payoff is completely lopsided unless you are willing to give this game thousands of hours of your life",1662005204,1683437951,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Unlike any other MMO's they simply abandon their game without giving any update and take the players money.
You Absolutely can grind anything on this game without cashing out that much. I do rarely buy pearl shop items and i do buy only when its on sale.

Pros:
- there's a lot of things to do in the game (hunting, fishing, cooking, alchemy, gathering, horse training, bartering, sailing) they're a chill side thing to do in the game. Or it can become a main one for a lot of people as everyone likes different things)
- the character customization IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST out there (that was the main reason I played this game from the start, and now that I don't play the game anymore it's the only reason I still sometimes come back to it 😂 but only to customize characters)
- the graphics, the places, the whole world is absolutely gorgeous, clear, beautiful and huge! There's so much to explore and see!
- seasons are nice and help you get decent gear faster
 

Cons:
- there's some bosses and stuff you can do with your friends too (but tbh it's not a lot and it can get boring after a few times and become monotone
- It's very likely playing this game will become a chore and not something you enjoy but something you HAVE TO DO because you HAVE TO GO TO THE BOSS at this time or you CANNOT miss a node war with your guildies and blah blah blah. It's not a chill enjoyable game anymore once you get addicted and you're required to do things
- it's extremely grindy, which is not fun and people can be toxic - they will kill you at sight because they're having a bad and and pick a fight if they're bored. Grinding can take you literal hours from your day, doing the same thing over and over again. Imagine you're spinning between the mobs for 4 hours just to get some loot that you can sell for a bit of money.. If you think that's enough money to buy you the gear you need or the horse you need. You're absolutely wrong. 😂 Try repeating the grinding every single day for a month or more doing that for a few hours and maybe you get strong enough to not get one shot by most people in the game. 😂 Also the same goes for dropping a special loot. It's rare to drop something good or valuable.
-enhancing is an absolute nightmare I still sometimes wake up from a dream, getting ptsd from trying to enhance a necklace to TET or PEN and accidentally not clicking crons and the necklace is now gone. Time to spend a few billion just to get it back or replace it with some capotia one we got for free as a gift which has was less AP. 
- there's super cool dream horses, that cost ONLY 12 billion or you can try to make one. You probably will manage to get one after 32 attempts (that cost more than the 12 billion) but hey at least you didn't spend it all at once.. Right?!!! Oh and then there's even more special horses that you can get by breeding TWO dream horses! Yea good luck with that.
- a good thing is you can make a lot of friends in this game! You'll definitely make thrice as much enemies tho! Super fun!
-afk traveling outside a safe zone is dangerous there's some people that'll randomly kill you, or maybe they're your old enemies that will kill you for a reason that is also unknown.

Overall 
It's a super fun chore -I mean game. But the fact stays it is very beautiful! I recommend 😁 just don't get too addicted, unless you don't have life at all and want to live in bdo like most people do.",1683052569,1683052569,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I´ve played it since it came to Steam and have never spend this much time in a Video game. These hours are nearly all active hours and not really any afk time. I´ve met my wife through this game and have spend way to much money on it. 

If you are looking for a game you spend a lot of hours into, than this is the game for you. For an MMO the fighting is purely unique. Having tried WoW last week i have to say, everything besides Black Desert combat wise, bores me. It´s really overwhelming for beginners but keeps you entertained until you have spend at least 200 hours into it. After that time it becomes really ""grindy"" (which MMO dosen´t). The thing most players hate is the Luck-Based upgrading System. I don´t think it is that bad. You have a lot of fun and fond memories until you have to grind for a month just to see your progress disappear. 

I can recommend this game dearly, but you have to know when to stop and don´t spend any money on it. Now you will receive everything you need that you had to spend money on in the past years to play properly. So go on, try it. Its only 10 bucks (5 when on sale).

the awesome stuff about this game ends at the flashy combat. outside of that, the movement feels clunky, servers are unreliable, and the UI is garbage. This entire game feels like a PS3 game with good graphics. 

this is further exacerbated by the Magnus questline. A supposedly QOL quest that aims to make it easy for you to grind on two characters.

I can understand that those letters' look may appeal someone's sense of 'arcane' and such, but in my opinion they were a REALLY POOR CHOICE for a game having to do with a lot of magic, especially as they are notoriously considered to be an 'anti-magic' alphabet.
Knowing this, being the erudite scholar that I am, I decided to honour my knowledge and choose another class.
I still fail to understand why the Hebrew letters were so overly abused in these skins. Is there some meaning I'm missing?

I've given Black Desert Online a few chances over the years, but I still can't seem to enjoy it. It feels like a casino game and a place where only rich kids get to enjoy, which makes it feel elitist and uninviting.

[b] Pros [/b]

The combat system is one of the best since TERA shut down. It's the only reason I might consider coming back to the game.
Character creation and design are well thought out and enjoyable to play around with.
The game's visuals are impressive, with great graphics and skill effects.
There is a lot of depth in the game, with unique features such as sailing and mini-games that add to the overall experience. Crafting and gathering are also enjoyable.

[b] Cons [/b]

Gear Upgrade System: Downgrading and sometimes even losing the item you are trying to upgrade is the biggest problem for me. Yes you can use ""cron stones"" to not lose your item but it still has a high chance of downgrading. Which means you lose progress and I can't stand that. (Counter argument to this is to grind and buy the item that has been upgraded already, which I will come to that later on.)

Grinding and the RNG system can also be tedious. I am not a fan of solo grinding. It feels bland and boring. 
You are given scrolls and potions that increases drop chance but even with those items grinding feels unrewarding. The percentage must be super low that even popping all the consumes needed, the item you are looking for will not drop for hundred of hours. Which takes the fun out.

P2W: I don t understand how people think that this game is not p2w. 

The minute i joined and asked what I need literally everyone told me i needed to BUY campsite tent. After trying to grind for infinite potion pieces I have realized that they did not put any merchant NPC around so that you can not sell the trash items that you have to sell because of the weight (gets heavy pretty quickly). Silver may not have any weight anymore but this does not feel any different than before. Not just the weight, you can also repair in tent and even get buffs that gives you extra AP. 

People buy 35 costumes in a week and sell them in market to get in game currency. They can get 1 PEN item in 4 weeks with that. As I mentioned before, because of the gear upgrade system is so bad even players ignore and find a way to avoid the system.

This is the least of the problems but i really like holy trinity and believe that games with holy trinity have decent mechanics that makes the game really fun to play.",1682694860,1682694963,False,0,0,0.490275532007217407,3,True,False,False

The PvP system is a whole other can of worms. Like, seriously, high-level players just want to harass those who are lower-level? Where's the fun in that? And let's not forget about the bugs and glitches that make the game even more frustrating.

So Black Desert Online is an Open World game. Where you can choose from ALOT of different Classes. You can either be a mighty Warrior or a Magical Wizard or Witch or the other Classes that are there. It's you're choice on what you preferr.

Pro's :
- Graphic's are just beautiful!
- Epic Open-World where you just have to explore! 
- Beautiful environment.
- Alot of things to learn 
- A lot of Classes to choose from
- It got ""less"" p2w then it used to be after they changed contracts. You get alot of stuff free nowadays.

Con's :
- Based on RNG luck. (basically it's secretly a Gacha-Game on steroids)
- To really get started you do need some pearl item essentials (P2W Tent), either you can (no must) spend around 300 or 60 only. 
- No monthly subscriptions but having a Value pack, Kama blessing and Old Moon Book is kinda necessary to make ur life easier. They give very good buffs so yeh.. 
- Gender-lock classes
- U have to play to not miss out and stuff


If I will keep on playing?
I am these days very much on and off. Recently started playing it again

Is it worth the money?
Well however you look at it..

Would you recommend it to you're friends?
Yeah I would I guess

The game boasts breathtaking landscapes and detailed character models that create a rich and engaging world for players to explore.

One of the standout features of Black Desert Online is its deep and customizable character creation system. Players have an incredible level of control over the appearance of their avatar, with a vast array of options for customization that allow them to create truly unique characters. Additionally, the game's combat system is fast-paced and action-packed, requiring players to utilize a wide range of skills and strategies to succeed.

The game's storyline and lore are also well-developed, with a rich history and a cast of characters that add depth and intrigue to the game's world. The game's quests are engaging and varied, ranging from simple fetch quests to complex storylines that take players on epic journeys.

However, Black Desert Online does have a few drawbacks. The game can be quite grindy, requiring players to invest a significant amount of time and effort to progress through the game's various systems. Additionally, the game's monetization model can be a bit frustrating for some players, as many of the game's more powerful items and cosmetics are locked behind a paywall.

Overall, Black Desert Online is an excellent MMORPG that is well worth checking out for fans of the genre. Its gorgeous graphics, engaging storyline, and deep customization options make for an unforgettable gaming experience.

The quest markers often point you in the complete wrong direction due to bugs, and since fast travel isn't a thing you basically waste plenty of time running back and forth whether it's on foot or horse. It's SO slow. 

If an enemy can stun lock you 100x in a row, what's the point of even fighting it solo? Just have it kill you with a guarantee ohko that's a bit fair to dodge. Not some unseen attack and mechanic that locks you into place for 20 minutes while you burn through hp potions to hopefully escape. OR, give the player an invincibility i-frame window after a certain number of stun locks to AT LEAST attempt to regroup. The frustration from this alone is an instant dashboard and opening of any other game that doesn't punish you for getting hit by unseen bologne. Yes, bologne. 

Quest Markers being bugged is only mind-boggingly infuriating because there is no fast travel. If you accidentally run across the map due to this, you just wasted 30 minutes travelling. Other games, this takes you 10 seconds. This isn't even bad once or twice. The game is beautiful, the scenery is fantastic, but the slog of getting anywhere makes wanting to do this 5x awful, let alone 100x. 

Group-content... why doesn't it auto que you with another group when attempting the few dungeons the game offers? Or other solo players. Yes, the option appears to do it solo... but why does the option appear to do the ""group"" version if it doesn't matchmake you with others? Simple fix - grey it out or place a comment beneath saying (you must find a team yourself, this is not a matchmade activity) SIMPLE. 

Visuals are still top-notch though, only thing keeping me from uninstalling and never coming back tbh. Everything else is just tedious, and I love games that require grind. Just not wasted grind, that's just big poopy to me.",1681853107,1681853107,False,0,0,0.491967886686325073,0,True,False,False

Pros:
[list]
    [*]Great openworld content.
    [*]Many lifeskills to try. My favorite is horse training and sailing
    [*]Amazing skills animation, butter smooth combat.
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
    [*]P2W. Many dogshit systems that force you to spend money. Especially if you care about being competitive
    [*]Pvp is trash. Server desync is real, classes are not balanced at all.
    [*]Super RNG heavy.
    [*]PvE content is grinding mobs in circle for hours. No challenging content.

Outside of personal experiences with the community, it feels like:s

1. Gameplay and HUD are too complicated and the learning curve is just tedious, everything following that is just monotonous

2. The world is way too busy and overstimulating, and makes it difficult to get immersed as a new player

On start, I went to settings in the main menu. Somehow, altering the graphics  somehow changed the entire screen resolution of my computer, even after the game was closed. This lead to extensive fiddling with UI and resolution to get something that didn't put menus off of my screen. Unfortunately, these efforts were wasted, because the frame rate counter in the settings menu was only reading 60 fps because it was measuring the start screen alone, and did not reflect what I had when I started the game. 

Upon starting the game, you are immediately shoved into a heavily restricted tutorial that does not appear to allow you to access the settings menu- since the esc key just takes you back to character creation at that point. And unfortunately, I could not find any way to get back to the start screen and settings menu from the character creation/server pick menus (this might be an effect of the resolution/UI scale issue... which is a problem in and of itself)

I am sure this is a great game when you can get it to run. But this forces you to repeatedly shut down the entire program and restart the game for every attempt to try a graphics setting until you get something you can stomach through the tutorial. 

I also had issues since I had hoped to go directly into controller support, but I understand that is a ""me"" problem when it comes to PC games. The settings issues take far more precedence.",1681174947,1681174947,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

you'll enjoy your progression and the experience for a couple of months, you'll probably join a guild and their discord and get to be friends with some of the people you play ""with"".  that's about it.

the main selling point of this game is combat and graphics - the game can look great, but it's not feasible for combat, as your damage is tied to your fps (no, i'm not joking, yes the devs have tried fixing it and it actually broke the game, so they have no plans to change it).  additionally, due to the nature of mmos and each user being connected to a server, ping is certainly an issue. classes with a lot of protection combined with users with high ping equate to opponents being in protection for far longer, with gaps in it appearing far less frequently.  if you're curious to see this in action, for NA, find any Aussie sorc and enjoy. the combat can be enjoyable and rewarding, up to a specific gear point.  after which, there is minimal balancing, and the combos and skill rotations you've learned and mastered are useless, as it becomes a test to see who can get one-shot through protection first.

the grinds are boring and repetitive, even if you try changing up the class you grind on or the location you grind in.

the community is mixed - on one hand, they will scream about the most efficient grind possible, and then they will go right to the enhancement screen instead of simply buying the item off of the market by grinding an extra couple of hours.  in one breath they will tell you about why your current progression is bad but then they will give you the wrong advice on how to progress next.  most of the community is so focused on their own grind, any form of pvp is just an instant server swap or they'll bring their entire guild to fight one person.

the developers are awful - every single major event where they make announcements is filled, and i mean FILLED, with ""we've decided to delay/rework/cancel this upcoming content that we announced 2 years ago, sorry"". i'll give you an example - in 2020, they made a big deal about adding a tower-like dungeon that you could do cooperatively.  they said that they would have it with the next big region update, late that year.  fast forward to DECEMBER 2022 - they announced that while they were in the final playtesting of this dungeon, their play testers found it to be too difficult and SCRAPPED IT ENTIRELY.  Their most consistent updates are to, of course, the cash shop and to in-game items that make existing cash shop items sell better.  enhancing an end game item too hard and your market place preorders won't go through? no problem! pearl abyss has developed an entirely new item that you can enhance to have the same stats as the end game item! as with all expensive enhancing, the only way to protect your enhancement from downgrading is by using a rather rare resource, which is conveniently available en masse in the cash shop! don't even bother submitting feedback - there's a few discords and official channels where they allow players to make ""suggestions"" but if you're not korean, you will be ignored.  part of the reason the class balance is so bad on na, eu, mena, sa, ru, etc is because class balance is geared towards the korean playerbase and regional ping (tip: it's always low!).  why is berserker busted? because the devs keep buffing him in the hopes that korean players will use him despite the character being ""ugly"" (even though you can customize your character to a high degree). why is awakening mystic terrible? because the korean playerbase considers her to be very good (she is not).  they continue to add more and more classes to a game that they can't balance as is.

don't play this game.  please, take it from a player who's sunk 11,597 hours in over 5 years, along with $11,726.12 USD, into this game.  it was fun for a long time, but i can't say that anymore.  the game is not good.  it is not fun.

tl;dr - fun for season if you're new, repetitive after the first one. graphics cool, but don't matter because you won't be playing the game in them. community is dumb, but you'll find some cool people. devs are horrific, dumb, money hungry, and will not listen to your feedback.",1575188329,1681107744,False,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

While i am giving it a good review i sadly cannot recommend this game for those with a weak wallet.  This games pvp is all over the place with balance issues and at the end of the day thats what this game is trying to draw you to. the pvp. The life skill aspect is pretty decent and you can go that route but it has its own cons some of which others will just leave you in the dust.
---------------------------------------------
((Cons))
-Gear score can take years to even get to a point where a F2P casual player can be relevant.  Unless you are down to put in some hours daily.
- Upgrading system is very Korean and convoluted.( you will spend hours and days grinding at a chance to just blow your gear up and do it all over again)

-Very Pay for Convenience Heavy compared to other mmos

-Pvp is forced at some points. (not fun contesting a grinding spot they fail to hold, so they call on a few friends/clan and now youre 1v3 in a grind spot youre sick of and still...  defending it thinking about the money you could have made in the time you have to fight for this spot. 

-Not a lot of multiplayer content aside from pvp so you will be alone most of the time. assuming you dont have a grind buddy

-No dungeons

- You will need a guide for most things as the game is a complete confusing mess with menus and quest scattered all over, Confusing crafting and Upgrading menus. 

((Pros))
-Beautiful graphics.
-Best char creator to date
-community can be great.

I love coming back to this every so often and see what else is going on, never felt in any way that I was 'grinding'  to get where I needed to be or to craft with this game.

Thought I would update my review 20k or so hours later. What I said above is still 100% true; i just wanted to add more detail about a few controversial points that people always ask about: grind, pay2win, gambling. 

If you enjoy grinding, especially the kind of grinding you can pair with secondary distractions like 2nd monitor TV shows or music & discord, then this game is godlike, 10/10, fun long grind good combat good lifeskills good marketplace good long-term plans you get to invest & strategize and come out rich.  Put in the time and you'll get to the end. 

You can always pay2win too but be aware, pay2win in this game doesn't uniquely make you godlike, it just puts you on the level of the people who've been grinding for years. If you want to feel like an OP god via your credit card you should probably play another game that makes pay2win easier for you. Besides, most of the gameplay is either solo (so why pay to be more powerful?) or if it's PvP it's usually PvP in stat-capped contexts where extra gear either doesn't help or only in limited ways helps. So... yeah you can pay2win. It's just probably not what you think. That's why people still argue about this to this day, there's so many little ""if"" and ""but"" to this stuff; it's kinda complicated, lol. I'll say it again and again, you can pay2win in this game, people do pay2win in this game... but you don't *have* to. What you do with that knowledge is up to you; plenty of other games have NO pay2win, so if it's a dealbreaker, well, it is what it is.  

If you can't stand grinding and just want meaty novel experiences every moment you login, then just go play other games and save yourself the effort. This is a game where you'll log in and say ""oh boy! Time to kill trolls for the next 4 hours! And in another month of doing this, I can buy the sword that is 137 AP instead of 128 AP!"" See what I mean? Being able to tolerate or enjoy long repetitive grind is a prerequisite to finding any satisfaction in this game. If that's you, then welcome! If that's not you... well, i'm just saying it like it is. This game's a grind, buyer beware. 

If you are susceptible to gambling addiction, avoid this game. You don't HAVE to gamble, but if you are susceptible you WILL gamble. And if losing gambles is frustrating for you, well you will lose gambles and you will be frustrated. You will get impatient with saving up 150 billion silver to buy a new earring, and you will look at that enhancement menu and say ""4% chance I get it in one click, 96% chance it downgrades"" and if you get tempted, you click that and guess what? 96% chance it fails, just like it says. meanwhile, your lucky friend will take the chance and get it, easy. Jealous? It's a casino. Like my other points, if this kind of thing is a deabreaker, then stay away. It is what it is. 

Anyway, if the above info doesn't discourage you, the game's cool. It's got fun combat and the guild wars are cool. I certainly like it, maybe you will too.",1576130473,1680724232,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pro:
- lot's of diffrent and unique classes (Every year they add more classes)
- events (There is always some event going to keep you busy)
- Horses/ships (there are tiers of horses and ships in the game)
- big open map (you will spent a good amount of time exploring)
- community (most of the community is kind and helpfull to eachother)
- Lot of Pets (pets give you buffs and make your work somethimes eassier)

Contra:
- Gear (I find the amount of armors and weapons really low. You either do a season for season gear or you spend a huge amount of money to have some decent gear)
- Upgrading system (you upgrade your armor/weapons/etc from 1-15, after that it's in romen numbers 1 to 5. Once you hit the romen numbers the chances to succeed are really low. I find the jump too high)
-Trading: You can barely trade something in the game with your friends. Almost everything goes through the central market.

The uptrend in player numbers and clear increase in popularity is, in my opinion, a direct result of the positive changes made over the past two years to almost entirely overhaul the game from its old customer gouging practices that were enforced by their original and ever infamous publisher, Kakao Games (you may know them from their ruining ArcheAge fame). 

Pearl Abyss became their own publisher in 2021, and since then they have taken the game from strength to strength, making the game more and more new player friendly, and giving away so many once expensive and exclusive pets, maids and outfits, to the point that it has become genuinely hard to justify spending any money on the game these days even as an experienced player.

I started this game six years ago when it launched coming from archeage with a group of friends.  In that time i purchased virtually every upgrade one can for their account, character slots, weight limit upgrades, outfits, underwear, premium time.  First when it was under Daum games, then when Daum got bought by Kakao, and even when Kakao got bought by PA.

This game was my go to when no other titles held my interest, PA's decision to delete all characters that didn't transfer actually required more effort and labor than simply transferring everything.

Losing my chracters is forgivable, they can be replaced.  But the thousands of dollars of cosmetics, inventory upgrades. The hundreds of hours of collecting knowledge enough for over 300 energy and 300 node investment points, Grinding out S rank for the popular farming mobs, learning the conversation chains to collect gated knowledge from NPC's, Grinding out the materials for a merchant vessel, breeding high tier horses, etc....

Losing that investment not because the game was shut down, or because i did something that violated ToS and got banned, but simply because PA decided not to transfer all accounts... It leaves such a bad taste in my mouth I caution anyone against trusting that their characters in ANY PA TITLE will be there waiting for them should they decide to take a break from said title.

TL;DR: Thousands of dollars, hundreds if not thousands of hours, all gone for reasons that still defy explanation.  This game was a gem, despite all it's flaws, and PA ruined it for me and who knows how many other players.  Buyers Beware.

P.S. The real kicker is less than a year before the transfer when i was still actively playing i purchased BDO on steam in the hopes of moving my account from the independent launcher to the steam launcher and put in a ticket to request it only to be told, 'this is not possible'  I installed the game and ran the launcher overnight just to be able to leave this review.

1. Chat?? I try to play BDO with a friend and I don't always feel like using the mic, so the chat feature is nice. Except... we can't seem to see the chat box no matter how hard we try? I had one character I made who had the chat box from the start, then every character after didn't. It's weird and dumb.

2. The quests; again, I play this game with a friend... it'd be nice to have the same quests to work on.

So much stuff in this game.


Edit:
->After playing a LOT more of this game, I can say it's pretty darn good! 
It seems to have a lot more than other MMOs but the gameplay is like.. Completely different. 
There's no dungeons or really anything like that. 
There's this whole community store type of thing where you can sell and buy gear, food, and other random things.

[h1] Play style and Life skills [/h1]

->THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENT PLAY STYLES AND STUFF YOU CAN MAX OUT IS CRAZY! 

->They have a whole section for your strength and stuff like that, but there's a lot of skills you can level up called life skills. 
These include, 

Gathering
Processing
Cooking
Alchemy
Training
Fishing
Hunting
Trading
Farming
Sailing

->And these can all be lvl'd up a CRAZY AMOUNT. Increasing the skill level normally makes it a lot more worth doing that skill.
Like upgrading Gathering by collecting plants and stuff like that will make it so you get more of that item when gathering. It also makes it so it's faster to gather. 
Some items have level requirements. The life skill levels are a little difficult to understand at first, but basically they go; 
Beginner	        Lv 1 to 10
Apprentice	Lv 1 to 10
Skilled	        Lv 1 to 10
Professional	Lv 1 to 10
Artisan	        Lv 1 to 10
Master	        Lv 1 to 30
Guru	        Lv 1 to 20

[h1] Money Making [/h1]

->There's so many different ways to make money in this game. You can farm, craft potions and items, farm enemies, and even breed and tame horses. 
The horses have a level and skill system of their own. 

[h1] Character classes [/h1]


->There is also a decent amount of Characters who all have their own skill trees that INCLUDE their own 2nd Skill tree later on that you can decide if you'd like to upgrade to.
There's actually reason that you may want to make multiple characters.
Reasons being that;
1: They have these seasonal times every once and a while that makes it so you can create a SEASONAL character and get a punch of unique rewards, including enough EXP to get you to about lvl 50. 
2: To try they crazy amount of Characters abilities. The first Character I played was a Tamer. When I played the Tamer I didn't have to pretty much ever get off my Wolf thingy. The wolf summon thing you get after lvl 20 as a tamer is pretty much faster and stronger than any horse. It also has like this life steal and mana steal thing so I was able to pretty much never die and just kept fighting high level enemies and bosses.
3:Some Outfits and weapons you find can ONLY be equipped to certain Characters.

[h1] Some other stuff about it  [/h1]

->It's kinda strange but there's a good amount of boat stuff in this game too. There's a shit ton of Boats with their own customisations and even like a upgrade tree?
->You can higher crew members for your ship to make it easier to use and even send them on islands to get resources. 

->You can higher workers and buy building for them to work at in order to produce items, clothing, etc.

->There's even a lil bit of Choice missions. They don't seem to change all too much though. 


[h1] Character Customisation [/h1]

->THE CHARACTER CUSTOMISATION IS AMAZING! There's plenty you can change on your character ALTHOUGH, the default features of a character (I.E. Their gender and some other small things) are Character class locked (I.E. Tamer class can only be female). You can change your voice too. If you don't want to or can't make a good looking character, there's a community catalogue in the character creator that has some GREAT and LOVELY looking people. 

[h1] The Map [/h1]

->The map is pretty fucking big too! There's a decent sized water part of the map  ( you need a ship for that stuff. It's got islands that you can explore a little), A desert part of the map (You need a compass to tell where you are in the desert and also some holy water so you don't die of heat), and then just some land parts that look different and unique depending on where you're.



->A lot of the game and characters are voice acted.

[h1] Conclusion  [/h1]

->There's so much more of the game that I did not talk about, but I am too tired to talk about the bible amount of stuff in this game. If you love MMO's or like to grind stuff, this is the game for you.<-

It's a beautiful world, and the character generation is way more detailed than an MMO has any right to be.
The world is unique enough that I find it enjoyable.  Far too often Fantasy worlds dig up Tolkeins grave and root around in his pockets for loose change for their ideas.

It does feel like over the years, they've completely cut the introduction to the world.  I guess that's for longtime players who just want to rush through the content to get to endgame though.

The action combat is exceptionally smooth, when I first played it, it was way smoother than I had ever expected an MMO to be able to pull off.

The classes are now varied enough to give you a lot of different options for different playstyles.  I usually don't like class based fantasy games, as I find them far too restrictive, and prefer a looser character building system.  But it's decent enough.

The Bad (For me)

I don't care for the endgame.  I know I went in knowing there was open world PvP, but I'd prefer it if it was opt-in or opt-out like some of the older MMO's.  So I really only play during Season.

Life Skills take up way too much time.  Even though I have something like 1.5k hours in the game, a solid 50% of that has been AFK doing life skill stuff.

Neither Good Nor Bad

The crafting system is almost exactly what I want.  If it didn't cause damage to the base item, it would be damn near perfect.  It's simple, you're not constantly replacing equipment once you get close to endgame, you're just upgrading your stuff.  Great.  But the billions of silver it takes to get high end gear, and repair your gear from damage, and failstacking to save your good gear.  Kinda ruins it.

Imagine allowing a player in the game to run around intentionally robbing guild storages and cashing the items in for his own profit. A player has been doing that for years. Reports have been made, forums posts have been made and garnered traction, yet for some reason, this company refuses to do ANYTHING about it. The player in question can't even speak in game, as he has been chat banned for harassing women and calling people the N word. He goes into game related discord servers and posts screenshots of his pillaging and mocks people for it. What MORE do these people need to see before they act?

All this you can accomplish even for FREE easily.

There's too many tabs, too many currencies, the tooltips are like short stories and the dialogue is as thick as pea soup. The combat is actually pretty fun with lots of promise but it took WAY too much of a time investment to actually GET to any of it. 

Also, it behooves me to say that, while the character creator *is* impressive, it's not nearly as unlimited as it would lead you to believe. Each class is bound to a model (and yes, the classes are gender-locked, which isn't as huge of a problem as I would have thought at first blush, to be fair), and while you can change the model's hair (the hair tools are actually pretty rad) and apply tattoos and makeup, you can't change the face very much at all without completely distorting it to look inhuman (or just plain disgusting). Want to make a thick-jawed, broad-faced Shai? Not gonna happen. It's not nearly as robust and creative as the game would have you believe.

In general, this game is pretty neat if you can invest yourself into it and learn all the labyrinthine systems and lingo. The combat's fun and the world seems pretty neat.

So many MMOs have a ""transmog"" or ""glamour."" This game has been out for years and yet it seems like there is basically nothing. 
-I am gonna say it. The whole game looks really flashy and really cheap. As if there were a real Black Desert game out there that is good and this is just the bootleg version. 90% of the NPCs are about half a step up from Oblivion. Potato people everywhere.
-My bags were full of a bunch of shit that I didn't even understand before I knew it. Just to continue my quest line I had to find a way to store this plethora of unnecessary bullshit. Clutter. Just clutter. That's what your inventory is going to be full of in this game. Want more space? Pay real money. Otherwise it's like a mailbox crammed full of junk mail.
-Know what else is cluttered? Everything. Too many pets, too many AI prompts, abandoned mounts everywhere, too many useless NPCs, etc. It's ugly.

- - game keeps corrupting itself on the fly, if a weekly update doesn't already do it
- - for me game audio is unchangeably in korean ever since they brought in japanese 2 years ago. Support clueless.
- - objects spawn on you, trapping you, while riding too fast
- - bothering me with 2FA on every startup when playing over steam. Just why.
- close to zero group content. They even went as far as to patch party grinding zones out or nerf them into oblivion
- gear progression is horrendous once you hit soft cap
- refusal of dev to combine the 3 different subscription buffs

Took a couple breaks from this game because of the extremely difficult gear enhancing system (just like many other people). I give this game a 9/10, if enhancing armor, weapons, and accessories was a little easier (Pearl Abyss has done a few things to try to make it slightly easier to obtain full PEN gear) I would give it a 10/10. 

Personal Opinion: I don't think that gear should ever be downgraded if an enhancement fails. And accessories should NOT break! I would rather have a slightly lower enhancement chance and my gear not ever downgrade and accessories not disappear. Or make it so that you don't have to have a RIDICULOUS amount of Cron Stones to prevent gear from downgrading/disappearing when enhancement fails, or make Cron Stones MUCH CHEAPER. And fail stack should still INCREASE when I use Cron Stones, especially since you are required to use such a ridiculous amount.

Combat feels smooth and satisfying with the combo system. Tho I don't totally understand the ascention and other things that are also not well explained.

The game is severely pay2win and the cashshop seems predatory with different currencies and having to convert them. So you lose track of the initial cost.

It has a upgrading system that is rng based, upon failure you can even have a destroyed item if you are unlucky.

There is next to no group content.  No dungeons or engaging things to do with friends - other than explore the map.  The entire game loop is centered around 1-shotting groups of several monsters, collecting their trash drops, and selling them to a vendor.

After you have farmed by yourself for 15 hours and sold all your trash items to a vendor, you then spend your earned money on a RNG armor or weapon upgrade.  When the upgrade fails, because it more than likely has a 0.001% chance to succeed, the item is destroyed.

This is pretty much the whole gameplay loop for making money and progressing your character's power.  Grind for money via monsters or tradeskills --> Spend money on RNG item upgrade with a very low chance; you fail --> Repeat.

 the game is definitely P2W if you take the competitive route. however you can play at your own pace do whatever gets you some money (you'll find many fun ways other than grinding mobs) and you can avoid the P2W system. granted there are a few thing you might want to buy for some quality of life and convenience (tent, fairy upgrades etc..).
to help you make your mind up, the price tag of the game is actually about 60$ of in game items just so you can be free (sort of). if you can get over this, you can enjoy the game for many many manyy MANY hours without spending money and collecting all the free stuff you get showered with. you'll find every town, city, even grind spots filled with players so the player base is pretty healthy too. hope that helped :)",1678286911,1678287215,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Pay to win. If you don't pay, then grind and gamble for god knows how long to MAYBE keep up with those who do pay.
- Pay for any good cosmetic. You'll look insanely basic throughout unless you use real money.
- Basically a single player game. It really sucks that there's absolutely NO incentive to interact with players unless joining a guild. Even the text chat is mostly dead.
- Voice chat features don't work, so that dimension of interaction suffers compared to New World, for example.
- Hard to learn for new players - combat feels great but things like workers, enchanting, trade are hard to get into.
- Probably the dumbest housing system. You can get rewarded for having more decorations in your house, so players just turn houses into depressing factories and it sucks. Feels like a damn mobile game there

As for how I think the game could be fixed
- Ditch pay to win
- Have a more clear late game (As in a clear number or level to hit, like GW2. lacking a level cap in an mmo is bizarre)
- Breath life into the social aspects of the game. dungeons, more reliable chat options, and REAL multiplayer content
- Allow new players to reach the highest levels in a reasonable amount of time. Again, they can't really expect to enjoy pvp or guild content unless they grind an excessive amount or P2W. 
- Please ditch the pay to win
- Maybe add in more world events that can reward players with iconic, powerful gear.... So you don't have to enchant.

If the flaws with this game were fixed i'd easily pay a monthly sub for it. So frustrating to know the game probably won't change for the better cause you have whales paying six figures, when the company could just fix the game and justify a higher asking price (I feel like that's insanely obvious yet it hasn't happened yet so idk.) But I mean I got the game for a dollar on sale so if that says anything.

PS: 90% of playtime is AFK processing

This game has changed substantially over the years, although the play style is similar returning players will be jumping into an entirely new game. So longevity wise don't expect current gear to matter in another few years.
It's slightly buggy, I'd say average for MMO's but FAR worse compared to other for large MMO's
It's something you'll have running 24/7 on a PC pulling power so if that's not something you want in a game I'd say that's the biggest drawback - it seems like an easy feature to have to save electricity like some games (or just not having an AFK component like other's

it has been out for about 7 years now and definitely feels like a 7 year old game - although there are MANY event's to keep players engaged, progression is near impossible without playing seasonal characters. So second big negative is the time commitment to reach softcap is much larger than comparable MMO's

the story is decent, but there is A LOT of it, which could be good or bad depending on your playstyle

if you got this far and there isn't enough deterring you from playing chances are this is a must try RPG so...
NOW, for the positives:
1. arguably had the best graphics of any MMO game closer to release - still upholds some very impressive graphics compared to major MMO's like FF15 and ESO
2. quest pathing makes linear progression
3. One of the largest selection of non-mechanic bosses (low learning curve compared to most games)
4. complex and interesting mass PvP
5. interesting and extravagant outfits for fashion players",1678041602,1678041602,True,2,0,0.532062351703643799,0,True,False,False

There is a new intro sequence with cool animations for some bits however has no english voice acting (Where the rest of the game does) and very VERY stale animations for all the characters compared to the original intro sequence and quests.

All of the quests at the start are just running from person to person talking then killing 1 to 30 goblins/imps/weasels then running back to the marker. 

During the new 'season' i have been completely overwhelmed with items and packages which i just cant use, they are giving a level 15 character items you cant use until level 50something so it just takes up more and more of your inventory. This might work to get people to want to level up however for me it just annoyed me because you either do the quests which dont give alot of combat xp or you just grind and grind and grind enemies.

Played on and off since launch but uninstalled this year with no intention of reinstalling.

Progression is extremely slow and its very hard to get to the highest tiers of gear. Grinding is pretty fun and there is a large amount of open world things you can do. As someone who enjoys doing *everything* or most things a game has to offer this game is not for me.

It is quite literally impossible to participate in all aspects of this game within a reasonable time period. Skills are slow and time consuming. Open world activities are slow and time consuming. Training past level 62~ currently is incredibly slow. Lots of alternative characters to gear up so having more than 1 set of decent gear starts to get time consuming. Production/crafting is done while afk so you leave the game open all night to do things while you're afk.

This game requires full dedication to achieve any sort of end-game and I am tired of the RNG.

If you're casual and want to immerse yourself and play for a few hundred hours go ahead.

Some updates are getting good, but the whole ""always more damage, dashes, iframes"" is just boring.

Even the simple arena isn't fun anymore excepted if you find someone to play with that'll remove gear and so as you, without using HP pots.
What about the crafting etc.... you may ask ? Some updates are great, really, but they balance it around people who just abuse some mechanics (ie bartering, having multiple characters, locked at lvl 49 etc... using sailing coupon) so they nerf it in such a way that's it's only worth if you do it like that, and it's just not funny.

PROS:

Game is very fun. New season servers are a good boost for newer players. The game is very nice to look at. Graphics A+ for  an MMO. Costumes are pretty unique and look great. Grinding mobs is enjoyable for now, combat is amazing. Mount system is amazing. Life skilling is one of the best in mmo games. PvP is very fun and active but gear gap issue. Season servers try to break you in to the beginning of endgame with a minimum gear score. 

CONS:

P2W (debatable)
Grindy
Gear system , rng etc.
theres always a meta with classes

There are some bugs sure, but this is by far one of the most beautiful game worlds I've had the pleasure of spending time with.    I hope it lives for another decade.    There are some hardcore fast moving players in this game.  Returning players who can level and gear insanely fast.   

If you are a new player,  personally I recommend ignoring their pacing.   Take time to explore each class and play through the main quest line a few times.   Read the story,  stop and smell the roses.     If you're an older gamer and you can take some time to appreciate how far we've come with games you'll enjoy this.   

While I don't expect to be able to rank well, or compete with high level players,  I'm going to be spending some time here just enjoying it for what it is.     The combat is phenomenal,  the classes are built well,  the game world is just amazing.  

My goal is to eek out just enough of a presence to enjoy the different parts of the game without feeling like im grinding myself to dust.   

It's all about fun.

you can play it casually. progression isnt as cancer as 4 years ago 

the developers patch the game regularly 

but class balance is a complete joke . so if you are a competitive player you will get mad at either the lack of balance patches to classes or the random insane buffs to certain classes while others seem to be left behind

25 classes and 2 specs for each class so 50 different play styles. not all classes and specs are equal. but play what you enjoy. if you want to chase the meta play what ever the newest class released is at the time in which you want to play

the cash shop has some mandatory stuff in my opinion. but its a korean game so what did you expect
its less cancer than it was 4 years ago. but you will still spend money 

the combat is 1000 out of 10 
the system its self and the feel of classes is incredible i would compare it to playing a 3rd person fighting game more than a mmo. 

the better your pc is the better your experience is. the game has player animations tied to fps so if your a 60 fps gamer, your  skill connection speed and fluidity is much slower than some one playing at 144 fps there is a point of diminishing returns to this speed benefit from high fps but there is no hard cap. 

this means that while the game looks pretty on high graphics, everyone that pvps turns everything to potato mode for advantage.  so if you have a  lower end pc. you have to accept this fact. 

the games default optimization is very poor as it wants to eye candy you . googling a bdo optimization guide will make your experience a million times better. 

open world pvp is unlocked at level 50 
there is life skilling in the game as well and it is very in depth. 

there is seasonal ranked 3v3 called Arena of Solare
there is Team Death Match  game mode called Red battle field

there is Guild vs Guild battles called Node wars and Seige where players fight over open world objectives for territory

the twitch community is a good place to get integrated into the game
also joining the Class Discord Servers for what ever class you choose to play

there are 3 dungeons out right now with a 4th on the way as well. but if monster raiding is your main love in a mmo this game doesnt have much to offer you. Field Bosses arent worth it (unless they rework them in the future) and world bosses are damage sponges 

The Game is fun

Sadly this is not what i expected. Don't let the beautiful graphics and nice looking combat lure you into this. This is one of the most boring, unrewarding games i've ever played. First of all it's chaotic, soo many pop up notifications etc.. Enemy AI is horrible, you just walk by them and they don't react most of the time and even if they do it doesn't matter since there's no challenge at all.. Quests with no point at all, uninteresting story, horrible loot system and many more bad things. I didn't even care about the quest rewards from a short point onwards.. Also it sucks big time that you get armors and they don't show on your character. You can only change look by getting outfits, which of course the biggest majority is pay to get... Or grind until there's no tomorrow. I have better things to do or play instead of playing this game and i believe so do you. At least i only paid 10 euros to get it and not 60. So no complains there. BUT YEAH, my end point is I DO NOT recommend this game.

It feels almost like a hack and slash but there is tons of amazing combos and free flowing action that take it many lengths further to the realm of action games. And that it has plenty. Action and exploration. 

The customization options are huge and there are tons of character classes. You can tweak the colors of pretty much everything and unlock some really great and even iconic styles, but also buy some amazing albeit expensive costumes with real money if tempted, although you do not have to. 

If you were looking for loot, this is not the game that would excite you with trinkets although there is tons to unlock. You can use the same weapons you got in the beginning, and play all the way to level 60 with just one set that you can upgrade to the max. You can choose out of different styles/looks of armor and weapons. But you do not have to worry where to get them. They are sold cheaply at the store. Of course if you want the super fancy and maxed out items you need to work extra. But you do not need those until you are deep in the game past lvl 60 and what you can get from the store or unlock as gift from your quests look really great.  

This game will excite you with a vast and meaningfully interactive world that you master with every action. A complex network of people and short stories that unlock more options and everyday stories. A deeper element of crafting than other similar games, and even trade of products and produce between cities and investing on lands buying homes, livestock, creating workshops, hiring people, capturing your horse from the wilderness, etc etc. Even horses have tiers and trainable skills. 

It is amazing for explorers. Great distances and vast vibrant towns and cities to explore. Characters you can interact with and unlock dialogues and quests in every corner. Even in the middle of the road. Even in the middle of a forest. If you expect a streamlined and relatively streamlined experience like WoW... this is not it. It is open, and chaotic, and vast. Like a real world. 

Of course, due to all these options and possibilities it can be a very confusing game for a newcomer as there is no teleportation, especially when you start understanding how knowledge works and how it affects who you can talk to, what nodes are and how they work to facilitate crafting or trade, but here's the cool trick, 
A. you do not have to deal with all these things at once, 
and B. the game is designed to take some of the burden of complexity if you so choose, you can just click on a little icon and the game will take you automatically exactly where you need to be while you are sipping your favorite beverage. :P

The game is definitely worth playing and investing time on it. If you need something simple, just to beat some challenging bosses wear a series of shiny throwaway sets and get some fancy loot to brag for a few days to your friends, this is definitely NOT the game for you.  While it has plenty of intense action, and combat mastery with amazing combos for each and every class, it is a lot more than just that.",1676627583,1676627583,True,45,1,0.734115898609161377,0,True,False,False

This'll be a long review, but surprisingly not even that in depth because there's a lot going on in this game.  

Bdo is very much not a sprint, and absolutely a marathon. It's near impossible for someone to reach end game in a short amount of time, but there are plenty of things to do(lots of different life skilling mostly) to take up your time, and your progression never technically stops, which is good. The game does look amazing(although there are quite a bit of pop-ins), and even with newly released mmo's, I still think Bdo is the one with the best graphics with very flash and fluid combat.  

Now, having said that, Bdo(at least at the time I quit approximately 2 years ago) was a very grindy game in every respect. As someone who doesn't like to repeat the same content over and over again, this game quickly became a chore and I ended up life skilling more than killing mobs. Combat that initially seemed cool quickly became dull as you just repeated the same combos over and over again. The many characters may delay this boredom, but it is inevitable unless you like that sort of thing. Mobs pretty much exist to be killed. In higher tier areas, it can get challenging, but there isn't really a reason to be farming there if you can't even kill the mobs efficiently.

To bring 'new content' to the game, there were regular events. Unfortunately, events were mostly the same thing, just with minute differences. Do a few quests(fetch, kill, talk etc), kill mobs for special drops or quotas, login daily; rinse and repeat. It gets quite monotonous, but this is a typical aspect of mmo's so it's not really something to complain about. There's only so much they can do I suppose. The problem is that everything plays the same(Anyone who's sunk more than a few hours will understand). 

The story...exists. If your comprehension skills are over 9000 and you like convoluted messes. 

The end game doesn't exist. No raids or dungeons, so no pve end game unless you count grinding. World bosses are there, but you can start them immediately and get some free loot(I'm not even kidding).

Pvp...exists, but personally I don't think it's very fun(I have fought quite a few people but it's rly disjointed). 

Personally, sieges(Mass pvp) feel boring. It's just a mess that'll blind you in seconds and takes a long while to set up. 

The rng systems implemented are a pain in the ass(to put it lightly), as progression isn't guaranteed, and you may blow billions of silver(Which could take months to acquire) in minutes trying to upgrade ONE piece of gear! I won't even bother mentioning the failstacks you need to prepare as well(which is probably one of the worst parts of this game). This rng system also applies to other things like uptiering horses(which isn't that relevant but they look good and obviously go faster the higher tier you go). 

The cash shop is also something of concern(Which apparently got much worse after I quit). The value-pack and other time-limited boosts like the blessing of Kama feels like a must have if you're going long term. The value pack costed about $20 or so AUD at the time I played, and it gave you more inventory, storage, xp gain etc, which is a damn big difference once you experience it. Fortunately, I don't really have a problem with anything else in there, and these boosts are the only things that felt truly pay-to-win. The costumes were pretty close though. You can also buy outfits to sell in the marketplace for ingame silver, but it's not worth unless you got a lot of $$$ to spend. 

Luckily, both the rng system and cash shop can technically be avoided if you use the marketplace, but you'll need to have quite a bit of patience and a lot of silver. So yeah....whales will definitely have the advantage. I'm not saying it's impossible to have fun and develop to endgame if you're f2p, but it's a damn chore that could take more than a year. If you're aiming to have all the best gear for just one character and you're f2p, then good luck. I'll check back in 10 years. 

Overall, this was a pretty good game but severely limited by terrible systems that any normal person would be annoyed by. The gear upgrade system is quite literally gambling, there is no other way to describe it. The only things that really keep people coming back is the beautiful graphics, combat and something I can only describe as a cross between sunk cost fallacy and stockholm syndrome. I.e. You spent too long with this game, invested too much, became attached(although you don't really know why) and now you're being held hostage and can't leave. It'll take quite a bit of willpower to drop it if you make it past a certain point, unless you got as mad as I did with the shitty systems and found better games to enjoy.

Did I mention that you'll also probably be running this game all day long? Yeah...the electricity bills aren't good...

If you read this far, you must really care about my opinion, or just don't have anything better to do. Either way, I'll end this with a simple question and answer. Do I recommend this game? 

Yea...nah, not really. If you got time to waste, go for it. If you like grinding, play this. If you hate rng progression, steer clear. If you're already in way too deep like I was, I commend you but also pity you. If you have more hours than I have(which there are likely many people), please tell me why.",1630289254,1676424694,False,92,3,0.830252647399902344,0,True,False,False

Came back after a very long time, I wish there was a neutral opinion here since what I'm going to talk about are pretty much two completely different games. 

Seasonal is fun, well balanced, and progress is fast.  It feels very easy to reach max armor/weapons and in general just feels really good to play.  If this game was just the seasonal part this would be an easy recommend.

However there's the main game which suffers from horrible balance, buggy quests, buggy dungeons, most content seems to be geared to cater for late game players.  I was doing main story quests and got to Atoraxxian (I hope I spelled that right) and you cannot even queue for party members until you've cleared it once meaning you have to solo a party dungeon.  I just came back and know noone to drag along with me and tbh I was just enjoying doing my own thing with minimal interaction up till this point.  Bosses such as Karanda and Kutum have variants that seem to have extremely high gear reqs as well as even with full tet I tended to die fairly quickly even while doing mechanics.  Garmoth is still one of the most boring boss fights in the world which I was looking forward to being improved.  The plus side is life skilling in BDO is still good always has been.

TLDR: Personally I'd just play for seasonal/life skilling as most content in the actual game is catered to late game players.",1511144453,1676318702,False,1,0,0.477941185235977173,7,True,False,False

You can make several characters and they can work together to a degree (not in combat, obviously).  You have to actually play the combats out - like moving, attacking, performing crazy combos, etc.  Each class I've tried has been fun, though certainly some more capable as a solo than others.  The market place pushes for gear to be available to people even outside of a guild / team / gang / whatever.  I found the crafting to be enjoyable, as well as managing my workers and properties.  That's not end game either, you are crafting and possibly building your worker empire within the first couple of hours.  All optional of course, but in this game, in-game-money makes your character blitz through the fights...  which lessens the grind (or shifts it, depending on whether you watch your crafter work or minimize the game and get some sleep while they toil away).  I didn't upgrade my weapons - that system looked like a nightmare.  Just like in life - make your in-game-money however you like and buy the fruits of someone else's labor for the parts you don't like.  Then go stab something.

-The UI looks like it came out from a mobile game, probably one or even the worst i've ever seen; 
-The tutorial is inexistent;
-Progressing without paying feels like a waste of time (no paying means losing your social life alongside 4-5 years of time wasted, but if you pay maybe its gonna take like 2 years... maybe)
-forced pvp even tho its not that huge of a problem, just git gud i guess;
-the game feels like a mix of the most famous mmorpgs out there but making a mess out of it, everything feels pointless and unfinished like some mechanics that have been completely abandoned.

The only pro i give to this game is the combat and the character customization, one of the best i've ever seen... but other than that? the game feels like a big money grabbing machine that gives zero fuck about the community and keeps making pointless update with just more grind and more microtransactions.
Before buying and play this game ask yourself a question... do i have anything else to do in my life?

There is a lot to do although a bit more complicated then a lot of MMOs. 
I only play casually. No PVP so I can't speak on that aspect.
There are a lot of events and seasonal things to do. 
As far as cosmetics go there is a ton of stuff to buy in the pearl store. But you can get free stuff and outfits by doing events and seasonal stuff as well as logging in each day.

My rating is 9/10

With that being said...

2. This is the Most Expensive Game I personally have ever played, a single Costume is around $30 bucks per character.  Pets are about $10 each (you do need 5 of them and get some in game but the best ones are for $). Most items expire after 14 days, There is a Trap at every Turn from Premium, Classic, Standard Costumes with very little explanation Hint: Premium is the only way to get the Awakened stuff so more $ is needed. This whole game is a money Sink, Don't even think about playing unless you got at the least $100 bucks and we are not even adding in the highly needed Inventory Slots.. and again another Trap you have to also pay for the weight limit of your inventory to be raised or having the extra Inventory wont do you much good to begin with.

The combat is superb with actions that flow into each other, a hybrid between action based and targeting that still can be actively dodged by the player instead of based on a chance. Classes have lots of mobility and the abilities are easy to execute on their own with lots of different combinations possible that add complexity to the combos that you can do with them. Classes are easy to play, but hard to master. 

The world has a level of details and thought put into it that very few games can even match. The cities are unique and without repeated elements. Animations and abilities effects are one of kind for each one. The armor set details surpass those of any other game in the genre. The lore and voice acting in a lot of the quest lines is very immersing if that's what you are after. 

Professions or life skills as they are know in the game are very entertaining and a big part of the game, allowing each character to level all of them, with deep progression, usefulness and differences between them.

The downsides are that the game is heavily influence by Korean gaming philosophy with lots of chance and failure involved to progress beyond the novice level of the game, and with extreme temporary and costly convenience buffs that although occasionally obtainable through seasonal events, still make the experience very poor when playing the game without them. Classes are gender locked meaning that sometimes the class that you would play does not come in the gender you would like. Lastly, endgame content in PVE consists of killing the same world bosses that are little more than loot piñatas, killing packs of mobs in certain areas and pvp and life skills/professions. 

The challenge of the game is based on gearing up enough to get into more demanding mob areas and kill them faster, but there's barely any content in PVE that challenges your skill beyond the capacity to stick to grinding (killing mobs over and over)",1675123856,1675123856,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game's developer's have not done much to address the game's issues and update the game.

What I dislike about this game is that I spent 3 of my 4 hours trying to find a solution to why I can't advance in the Ancient Stone Chamber. Resorting to YouTube, I figured out that there was a cut scene event that never activated. Even upon completely quitting the game and relaunching didn't help (among other TS tactics). 
Unrelated to my main problem: I find it off putting that you can't completely customize your character and that they are locked into a class. For those that don't care about character creation, this would be fine. I personally enjoy spending time creating a character that'll I'll connect to another world with. That immersion doesn't exist for me in this game.

Assuming you can avoid glitches like the one I encountered, the game seems like it will be fun. 

I may edit my review after another run with a new character. 

Edit: Glitch didn't happen the second time around. After completing the tutorial quests and finally getting to explore, the game really takes shape and drops you into a vibrant world. Some things are confusing at first such as housing, storage, and what the bank is actually for. For those of you who decide to become a merchant, good luck to you. Like every game as of late, they really like to push their premium shop so just a heads up there.

At the time it was by far the most incredibly beautiful game out there. It still is among the best n terms of graphics. PA's game engine was brilliantly executed and is proprietary. The combat is engaging, complex, and stirring. Travel by means of mounts keeps the player engaged in the constantly changing environments of the the huge map. There is land and sea content that are basically two different worlds in terms of game play. Dungeons are finally in the game after some five years without them, though they tend to favor elite players. 
I've essentially moved on to FFXIV at this point and have tried to quit BDO many times. But I just can't.
For al of it's greatness, BDO is deeply flawed. These flaws are mainly connected with its gear system. It's among the worst I've ever experienced. It revolves around an RNG scenario that promises numerous falured to obtain the best gear. And those failures are almost always always costly. Ocean content is glitchy and can create some difficult scenarios when they occur. This is obviously a difficult area for PA to address, since there have been marginal improvements over time, but there is a fundamental issue with it's implementation that will require a huge revamping of it to fix. As for its story and lore, it is much better now, but fitting it feels like it was something they had to develop and there was no real creative drive behind it.
Life skills are pretty well developed but are average for a game this size.
Comparing this game to FFXIV, my current game, I'm finding the gear system to be far superior. When you clear the content, you get the gear. Period. FF is story driven and is a masterpiece of storytelling. Gathering and crafting are a deep and well thought out journey. 
All that aside, I highly recommend BDO to anyone who enjoys a great combat system, beautiful graphics, a somewhat supportive community (though a bit toxic on occasion), and determination to work through it's flaws (it's worth it, believe me).",1674825875,1674825875,True,2,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Do not take it seriously, by any cost do not even try to compete if you're unwilling to throw a lot of cash out the window for some pixels on the screen.

That being said -- good combat, good graphics, interesting classes (too many for no reason) -- however it does not feel like a literal MMO, it is quite short-sighted, feels very repetitive with the amount of grinding for specific, bland items; might as well call it a Power Level Simulator.
Also lacks a social aspect as far as I'm concerned.
That is my impression for having played for less than four hours, that's the most I was able to unfortunately, maybe others will find the aspects that I found to be negatives likable, but as far as I'm concerned, this is not for me, and I'd assume it's not for many others alike.",1674820463,1674820463,False,1,0,0.475582718849182129,0,True,False,False

It's mortal kombat style combat in an mmo - though you can also assign abilities to a quickbar, it's much more enjoyable (and versatile) to learn how to combine your combos. to deal the most damage in any given situation. That same style is also applied to spellcasters, and it's done very well. While there used to be much fewer classes, there is now a plethora that allows you to pick just about any combat style you can think of in a fantasy universe. The story is a lot clearer now than it was when Black Desert first came out, and most of it is even fairly enjoyable to listen to (the main questlines have voiced lines for the most part). There are also certain choices of quest paths that you want to take, so there is a little bit of that ""rp"" from the ""mmorpg"", something most mmo's now forgo entirely. It also allows you to do a plethora of non-combat things that go rather deep in complexity the more you play. The housing system allows you to specialize your houses for storage, and there are even services that allow you to move items between cities without having to go all the way back and forth yourself. It's a very well thought out game, but the in-game shop is about as predatory as they come. Nothing from it seems required, at least 10 hours in, and after browsing the premium shop for a bit, it seems it's mostly cosmetics and convenience. Just be careful that convenience doesn't find itself too convenient for you, or you might end up spending a whole lot of money - there are a lot of different resources you can purchase with real money. Also, a lot of things you do are tied to your ""family"" (sort of a Legacy system if you've played SWTOR), as opposed to your character, which makes the game very alt-friendly.

It didn't grip me back then, but with all the changes they've made since I decided to try it again and I can honestly say it feels like an entirely different game when you give it enough of a chance.

Unlike most other MMORPG's, the game has a lot more of a focus on professions (Life Skills) to the point where it comprises of the entire end-game content and feels more like another world in a sense. Because there's far too much to do, you're forced to specialise in certain areas (as opposed to completing everything a game offers, which would put most players off in this game as it can be very overwhelming) which makes it more of a ""Choose Your Own Adventure""; personally I think that gives it a lot of appeal. The new Maegu class is also very fun with great combat flow, though I'm sure other classes have similar perks to make them enjoyable.

- pay to win system as you can buy features that allow you to bypass grinds that may take you weeks if not months.
-RNG system when upgrading your gear, for ultimate level gear you need to pay real money unless u want to waste 1 year of playing non-stop.
-PVP system is just broken, look up fps dps.

pros: 
No pros, what ever pros they game may have had are made to a big 0 by the fact that the game effectively has always on PVP outside of cities(safe zones). 
Unless of course you want a manager simulator game where you just sit in cities to process materials and sell them.  Need to note that for all life skills you need gear that makes you one shot for other players.

For example (and this applies to all other professions): if you are fishing (and fishing takes a long time with boring and stupid mechanics) you can get killed by someone passing by firing a volley of cannons in on you. You would ask ""so you got killed what is so bad about it?"". Well, remember this game has no teleport so you either fork cash or time (loyalties) to buy revive potions, or you get teleported to the nearest town and you either swim or retrieve the ship (this destroys the items you stored in the ship). 
In addition when you die you also loose quite a few fish (when you fish for high qual to get the most money you lose about 30 mins minimum of fishing time IRL, sometimes even more). So by getting killed you not only have to repair and waste time retrieving your ship but also loot what you were farming for.

""Well you can be the ones that do the killing and get the stuff from the people you kill"" - Actually no, retarded PVP-ers actually get nothing from killing other players. Yes you heard me right, they get nothing but the mentally challenged pleasure of resetting someones progress while they get no reward for it. 

Game is just a idle simulator as most people just leave the game running in the background

Black Desert is my first MMORPG game. Originally I was going for New World but they have no server in Asia and I got an unplayable 300+ ping. Ok, fine, let's go for Black Desert. The reason why I didn't go for Black Desert in the first place was that I was skeptical with Korean game companies. I also don't like those cheesy Asian style 3D graphics like in those Chinese RPG games. I really prefer American style graphics.

So I got into the game, the graphics was better than I thought, great. Kept playing, felt good. UI, systems and items are certainly too complicated for a newbie but with explanations here and there, I could managed it. I continued with the main quest for 5 hours and then I got stuck at the ""Black Desert and Black Stones"" quest (around 1/3 in the Balenos line). Then I spent another 4-5 hours trying to figure out if I missed anything. Then I found a walkthrough video on YouTube and figured out I almost certainly encountered a bug. Seriously? Treat a 5-hour old MMORPG newbie with a main quest bug? If it is with a side quest, it would have been better but now the game is pretty much unplayable. Ya, old time folks can say I can still do a lot in the game but remember I am a newbie, there are so much I haven't learned and didn't know that finishing the main quest would benefit much. I have already submitted a bug report and would like to see how quick they will response.

I may change this review depending on how quick and well the developers respond.

==Update==
The support answered my question after around 2 days. They correctly identified that I did not talk to the right ""person"". After reviewing two more YouTube walkthroughs, I found out that I have to ""talk"" to the church instead of the priest. What the heck? The UI is confusing enough. At least change to action to ""listen"" instead of ""talk"". Okay fine, I update my review and change it to ""recommend"".

Neither interesting was the storyline which is being forced into your gameplay. The buttons for interactions are kinda random. You spam R and sometimes E or some other button. 
The game offers wide variety of classes... the bad thing about it is that they're ALL GENDER LOCKED and there is NO CUSTOMIZATION. The only thing you can configure is the muscles, height, width and a tattoo...
The only positive thing I can say about the game is the graphics quality, but the animations in cutscenes suck.

After 82 minutes I was so bored I stopped playing.
Wouldn't recommend even for free, this game is boring and lacks features other MMOs offer like customization (and fun gameplay? ). 2/10 (points only for graphics)
Go play Guild Wars 2 instead. (R.I.P. Tera - the old good paid version of course)",1673643968,1673643968,False,1,1,0.452144026756286621,1,True,False,False

The MMORPG is heavily developed with expansive content as well as user activity, with farming, sailing, horse training, all the usual gamut of tradeskills, PvE and PvP content available to all players.

As a Korean MMORPG, you may find advancement in the game is gated by a very significant requirement to grind... however that's par for the course for MMORPGs, I think anyone who decides to dedicate a lot of time to one knows exactly what they're getting into. 

One of the drawcards for the game is the proprietary game engine with a solid reputation for high quality visuals and performance, and Black Desert doesn't disappoint.  You get 4K graphics support and a wide array of customisations and tweaks to ensure the game will run comfortably on any gaming rig.

Given how many hours of gameplay you get for a relatively low entry price, as well as the lack of paygating for content, this isn't a bad investment.  I can't suggest anyone pays additional money for the additional boosts, microtransactions etc etc... but you don't need to.  You can get dozens, if not hundreds of hours for the basic game package.

[h3]Former Rank 1 Economy Many Servers, I'm Still ""POOR""[/h3]
[Read My Detailed Comments for Rankings, etc]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2012903253

• [u]In BDO[/u] to get TET (rank 19, Great) FULL Legendaries (Blues are Ok if you can pass Softcap) is around [u]30-60 billion silver[/u] just for COMBAT GEAR (not Professions, diversity; 
• Loggia Green is Ok if have Full TET for a start 
• To get 1 piece of PEN aka Max (Lvl 20 without Caphras): 20-100 billion silver per piece if don't want to enchant Yourself.

[h2] New Players, Returning Players and Godly Players [/h2]

• [u]Lvl 60-61 is soft cap[/u] (old format took weeks/months), now You can be in several hours with Quests using Chenga Tome.

[h3] BDO has Insane Graphics, Insane Combos, Can Customize Anything like in 3D software [/h3]

• Ultra Sexy Outits, Naked things , Insane Mounts in Combat with Drifting, Super Speed like Bullets, gear, sets for pets, mounts, etc...
• BDO has Rankings for Everything (integrated in game) 

[h3]I recommend this game but...[/h3]

•  [u]Any Game[/u] that Use Microtransactions as P2A or P2W is Legal Scam/Cheat/Exploit, RIP OFF.
•  I've invested + 2000$ so far as [u]Necessary Stupid[/u] and I don't regret it.
•  Outfits, Pets (pick up, extra % for professions/combat), additional space, weights, etc...

[h3]You can buy with game currency (Silver) things that cost Real $ (players buy for $ and sell as game currency).[/h3]

• [u]In December 2019, I got things worth of 400 $ (using Game Currency from Central Market):[/u] Value Packs, Kama Blessing, Seal of Combat with [u]under 3 billions silver[/u], 
• I have for at least 400 days in real time if I want to use them, or I can sell back for more prices in the future.

[h3][u]New Players[/u] can get things that cost real money aka Premium things. Same in [u]WoW[/u] for [u]WoW Tokens[/u], etc...[/h3]


•  [u]For Combat[/u], [b]In BDO You need to be like in Mortal Kombat, Killer Instinct, tons of combinations for Combos and when You grind for several hours or more per day, 
• Your Little Pinky does the Most Work when used to Combine with other Keys or Keybinds, at least thousands upon thousands per day when kill minimum 20-50k thousands/day if do more that 8h avg on Grind Spots.[/b]


[h3][u]This is Why[/u], BDO has Auto Path, Semi AFK or Auto AFK for Professions, including Combat, Auto Run/Movement.[/h3]
•  [u]Even with 1000% Extra Bonuses is Horrible[/u] (50% I agree) [b]to Progress after reach certain High End for Rankings (Mostly Guru Professions or Lvl 62 for Growth), but is Progress, is Very useful (including Myself) while minimize and do Multitasking: games and so on...[/b]

[h3][u]Failing[/u] is a Must in BDO in order for Faistacks[/h3]

•  I was and I'm Ultra Mad many times when losing billions upon billions (I can be Mad even when I win because I don't want those things and I need Failstacks)
• ...that is the way to be Godly like My DK in most of the things. No Fail, No Success!

[h3][u]Mostly[/u], I like High Grinding : Combat, Quests, Anything[/h3]

• [u]I like Heavy RNG , mostly in MMos,[/u]
• [u]RNG can be ""Fooled"" [/u], Learn Cumulative Math (e.g. You want something that has 0.008%, for 100%, You need 12500 tries, kills, etc...Same, if You get 10,000% for 0.008% is 80% drop, chance, depends. Of course, YOu can be Lucky and get 1st try something with 0.0001%)

[u]Without RNG[/u] there is No Element of Surprise,
[u]Without RNG[/u] won't be possible to do different things and All can be the same...So, No Ty!


[h3]To All that don't know:[/h3] 
Same can be for Skyforge as Default, for Vindictus is [-/]  as Default

[u]Hide UI[/u] (Ctrl + U, default Shortcut, You can move, change any directions with Arrows [default keys) and much more, including Special Effects, so You don't need to use all the time 3rd party).

[u]You can use Observer Mode[/u] (Lie Back to Fence/Wall Press R Default for that) from Air/Space as 3rd or 1st View, up or down to Ultra Pixel on All.

[h3]Overall things about BDO with the recent changes (Q3/Q4 2019)[/h3]

•  Is a Korean MMOs and You get Daily: Free things, Attendance Rewards, plus are Tons of Events Every Weekly Patch...sometimes can be Premium [u] [Dec'2019: Daily for 1-2 weeks,  around 200$ to All Players][/u]

Those are just bonuses, won't make You Godly...
...is like You want to Conquer Universe with Speed of Light when is Not Enough, You are a Snail..

•  Auto-Feature (Auto AFK a lot of things, Auto Run/Movement).
•  Graphics/Sounds: Ultra Quality...mostly if use Remastered Settings.
•  Most Advanced Character Creation in Video Games...If have patience, you can make yourself from IRL. 
•  Hire workers, invest in nodes (some similarities like Civilization on map investment).
•  Awesome fast combat system: combos, fight from mounts, climb areas like Prince of Persia. 
• Lvl 60-61 is soft cap (old format took weeks/months), now You can several hours with Quests. I'm almost lvl [u]65[/u]. Only a few % people got lvl 65 in last years.
•  You can Craft Highest Gear or buy from others, is insane money sink to do it...Highest is PEN...almost impossible, usually TRI or TET.
•  FailStack is very important, fail to get higher stack to enchant high gear or sell to others.
•  Breeding Pets (T1-T4, Max Lvl 10): have special abilities and more...You can Sell/Buy.
•  Catch/Breeding Horses ((T1-T9 horses , lvl 30 max), Higher Tier Horses can have: drift, super super speed, etc...You can Sell/Buy. 
•  Takes Eternity to rise professions at Guru, can be Guru 2, etc...
•  If join a Guild, you can do Wars vs other Guilds. Ranking system for Professions, Military, Guilds.
•  Beauty Gallery/Photo (Vote, Upload/Download Character Creation with a lot of Sections).
•  Much more, including sailing (WarShips too), swimming, etc...

[h3]I end[/h3]

All the time, You have something to do, BDO has WoW Elements, Diablo, Shooters, Subnautica, Sea of Pirates, etc...All things in 1

• [u]I play Mulitasking Games, including 4 MMOs:[/u] BDO, Vindictus, Skyforge, WoW, other games (including Steam P0rn Games [including I edit and post for Steam Community Hub, Twitter], I don't want to push, be competitive in everything).
• In All I'm Pretty High as Progression, but none as I'm in BDO as Currently My Top of Top as Focus...

I like to say this game costs $20 instead of being free ( you can get this game for free or for a dollar for half of the year ) as you will have to purchase a tent buff. However, if you spend $60 on the in-game cash shop currency during a 2x pearl deal which they usually have around ~4 times a year, you can cover everything you need for convenience. $60 for this game is very worth it. 

There's a massive amount of things to do in game. The core gameplay is grinding though one way or another. If you don't enjoy grinding you may not enjoy this game. However if you don't care too much about gear gains that won't really be an issue. It's a sandbox MMO so you're basically free to do whatever you want.

-----------------------------
Upon further Reflection
---------
The best explanation for BLACK DESERT ONLINE... The game designers sat down in a room and looked at every system in an MMO and asked the question ""How can we make that system as complex and rewarding as possible"". This is the most fulfilling MMO to play for sheer content and true dynamic system complexity. 
When the game dropped the story was terrible and you had the black spirit constantly yelling at you to complete the story, which you didn't want to play. So he never stopped yelling XD. Now he no longer talks outside of conversations you initiate and the story actually has some depth to it. 
New players need to remember this is not a Completion Based MMO. You don't rush the end game in BDO, because the end game is not obtainable (so don't spend real money on the in-game shop), there is a soft end game but this MMO is constantly moving and mainly focuses on Character and Family Building. 
The creators of this MMO are HUGE FAN'S of the Aincrad Arc in Sword Art Online. They wanted to develop a game that gives you access to 5 years worth of content immediately with each system qualifying as a separate game in its own right (PVP, Guild, Life Skilling, Worker Empire Building, Markets, Knowledge Seekers, Player Housing....etc).
I wish someone would have told me this when I started BDO because if you look at this game like other MMOs or RPGs here is what you get. 
The feeling of being overwhelmed because there is too much content ((where do I start, how can I possibly do everything) (especially if you are coming from MMOs or RPGs that path-follow)), the struggle with every system being too complex (why can’t I figure out how to PVP, LifeSkill, Player housing…etc (all I am doing is reading/watching walkthroughs), the fear of being left out (It takes too long to master PVP, LifeSkill, Player housing…etc (what if halfway to mastery my friends or I want to do something else (this game makes me think about my own real-life path, I am unsure). 
So, to enjoy this game take your time, don’t rush, and embrace the complexity of each system as you learn them. Much like taking steps along your real-life path from School to work and finally a family or empire, remember neither is built in a day.",1645073563,1673212379,True,1,0,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,False

But unlike many other contemporaries today it's not due to a reliance on being narrative-driven or anything (especially for a game known to have some of the worst questing), but it's that grinding mobs solo is more than sufficient in reward while having the convenience of being mostly independent, outside of using the marketplace.

The act of grinding mobs in itself isn't bad at all and the devs have made sure to make a lot more zones viable, but every other part of BDO is feeling a lot less relevant when a mid-game player can make 300-500m+ worth of silver easily without much risk of being PK'd if at all. Older systems in the game that were formerly more important in the past such as the worker system also matter a lot less. The developers can add in as many journals or questlines as they want but they are just temporary distractions.

To the game's credit, it has seen a [i]lot[/i] of good QoL tweaks and other changes in the past several years, and the 'need' for going AFK overnight is nowhere near as strong depending on what it is you're doing. But many older problems such as the notorious enhancement system, cash shop, and higher FPS = faster combos still exist however subdued or mitigated they might be, and the current direction of the game sees newer ones like the sheer bloat in class count and legacy systems becoming irrelevant as mentioned before.

I would probably give a neutral rating if it were possible but even during a season (which a new player should be doing) it's hard to sell someone on Black Desert already especially when arbitrary self-goals are all I've got to go off. Having an MMO where you actually have to get around the game world without fast travel (Magnus travel costs are not insignificant) on top of having interesting combat systems and some side activities with their own mechanics do all sound nice on paper, but the game is now much more of a mob grinder first (and trying out things in advance for DokeV second) than it used to be and what there is of an endgame is not worth the trouble.",1673101784,1673101784,False,13,2,0.628115534782409668,0,True,False,False

It takes a little time to get comfortable with the UI, but it really is a very flexible one.  Well, mostly.  Why do these developers hate ""walking"".  I play with controller, and overall it is really nicely done, except there is no walk.  Yea, I know you can toggle walk with emotes (at least last update, mine disappeared), but it is ridiculously done, you toggle walk on, your controller stick only controls direction, you never stop till you toggle off.  Come one.  Pearl Abyss can't develop controller stick support better than that?  Give us proper controller stick support which walks with slight movement and runs at greater movement, as 95% games out there.  Worried about effect on combat, then toggle it no walk in combat.  Geez.  I have to crouch to move more slowly, or draw my weapons to move a little slower.  It just makes the controller support look very sloppy.  But overall, I like what they have done with the D-pad, ring configuration, etc.  Nicely done except for WALK!

They'll tackle anything that's easy, they'll complete any passion project or content expansion that they can throw into the game whether or not it turns out polished enough, but they won't ever fix the big ticket items that can easily ruin the experience for you. All it takes for this game to lose all value is one psycho that decides it's their personal mission to not let you play normally anymore. So I can't recommend this game to any of my friends anymore because I know far too many other players have all met more than one random psycho that doesn't let them play the game normally.

It's not that the players don't report the issues, or that the staff don't see and acknowledge them as issues, or that they don't have the means to address the issues effectively within their own policies. They do try some of the time, but their solutions to community problems are often too little, too late, or temporary fixes that eventually break again and are then ignored indefinitely. Streamers get banned for using boosting pilot programs, but the majority of the siege community does it out of necessity to stay competitive against other players doing it. Those streamers come back a few months later and are welcomed back as free publicity.

Toxic players that are permanently chat banned for saying atrocious things to people are left to run amok disrupting general gameplay afterward, instead of getting service revoked at the next sign of trouble. Chat bans somehow actually make it more difficult for support to gather evidence for reports, despite those bans themselves being clear evidence of prior negative behavior. Targeted harassment is brushed off as random PKing because it is easier for support to find the first article that applies to a ticket that lets them reject it, rather than address user complaints from every possible angle and make a judgment call after thorough review. Any toxicity that players endure is considered the responsibility of the victims rather than the fault of perpetrators, and players get away with harassing or stalking people for months on end with no serious response beyond ""We'll look into it, but we can't say anything"" or ""this functional use of the system is possible, so it is technically not an exploit or disruption"".

Victims of harassment, stalking, one-sided PVP griefing, theft, impersonation, and other hateful conduct are forced to take avoidant measures until the last measure available is quitting the game entirely. The problem with their operational policy is that they have very explicit terms about the extent to which they can punish disruptive, toxic, and hateful players, down to the level of individual and permanent hardware and IP bans. Instead of taking action to correct course for the community, they waffle about any of those kinds of issues until the players asking for help will simply choose to quit the game instead of being ignored again. There are a few good eggs left working for the NA offices, but it's clear that when they try to help their player base they are brushed off by higher-ups in favor of pushing sales or hyping up temporary content or sticking to the intended release schedules.

The newly revamped crystal system was a perfect opportunity to address players' ongoing complaint that the PVE death crystal shattering is more often a punishment issued to victims of desync, server problems, or PVP griefing in PVE zones, than it is to players who bit off more than they could chew while they were grinding. Instead of snowballing the crystal slot and storage changes into a full crystal system overhaul and letting Positive Karma remove PVE crystal breakage outright under the new system, they half-assed it and gave you a bag for your crystals and some presets to switch them. PVP griefers now have the ability to unequip all of their crystals on the fly, stunlock you in a pile of endgame monsters, and let the monsters kill you so all of your crystals break as a PVE death punishment. Despite the cause being obviously tied to PVP, there is no lockout or protection system in place.

Mechanically, the quality of life has been steadily rising, a lot of bugs, exploits, and general inconveniences have been fixed. However, the NA community's quality of life has been completely destroyed by toxic players' behavior going unpunished. The karma systems are archaic despite naval karma being relatively new, and karma mostly serves to encourage good behavior by having no penalty rather than providing benefit. Negative karma can also randomly and excessively punish the occasional slip-up for players that are normally in positive standing. But there are die-hard perma-red griefers for whom the system is a minor inconvenience at best, and remains a reason that they choose to permanently take out their anger on the community at large at worst. Players have been asking for an update to the guild storage system for years due to a handful of thieves randomly dumping entire guild storage banks and destroying all of the other players' hard earned items in an instant.

The players responsible for various exploits have often been named and shamed, with dozens of reports, dozens of support tickets, dozens posts on the community feedback forums, the community is doing all that it can to insulate and protect itself from toxic behavior. But the developers choose not to update the system to prevent the abuse, choose to tell us that we're not doing enough to avoid the toxicity, and choose not to punish the perpetrators effectively, so the problems will never stop occurring. The same can be said for a dozen of the older systemic issues that have not been addressed, and will continue to be exploited by bad actors until the company chooses to remove those bad actors, in addition to updating the systems. The player base certainly has no more faith that the systems themselves will be revamped to a satisfactory degree, so it's up to the developers and support team to actually clean up the community if they want to retain their players.",1673019341,1673019963,False,90,15,0.751298308372497559,0,True,False,False

I will not buy anything in this game because it don't give me opportunity to play with sane people on server I want to play, there is other Ukrainian people lefting negative reviews because of you not giving them access to right region launcher.

I've spent some time with trash Korean MMOs and I understand that there's a culture/language barrier at play, but it just feels like a fever dream. Nothing makes sense or is explained properly. It's totally chaotic. The UI at the beginning makes you feel like you're going to have a fit. The stories are bizarre, disjointed and the english translations are so weird I can't tell if it's because the translation is wrong or if my mind just works differently from an asian mind. I can see the English words make grammatical sense (a decent amount of the time at least) but after hearing a couple of sentences I'm thinking, ""What the  hell was that?!"". It's like a scattering of random ideas. The animation is VERY asian and so is VERY over the top with ridiculous voice acting sighs and gasps to fill the space (I had to add Korean language with english subtitles because the english voice acting is even more cheap and jarring). If you like cheap manga then you'll love this, but fuck me, I'd like at least something rational, logical and sensible to give this game some grounding so I don't feel like I'm losing my mind. Never before have I played an MMO where I feel I'm pushing through to get to a point where I can understand and enjoy the game. Every other MMO I've played that journey is somewhat enjoyable, but with BDO I'm just intensely irritated with how bad the storyline, animation (cut scenes I mean, the combat animations are cool) and game design are.

Main Quests
Side Quests
Sailing Quests
Magnus Quests:
  Basically fuck the long-ass quests, if you can survive the early questing stages, the game is great

Pros:
Great graphics:
  Game looks beautiful if you have a high-end PC, as good as Lost Ark, if not better
Interesting Class diversity:
  Many classes with different specs/playstyles, with different PvP matchups and PvE capabilities, the game allows you to 
  switch classes often
Best grinder MMO:
  Compared to ""grinding"" in MapleStory, Lost Ark, WoW etc., BDO grinding is more interactive. Skill rotations, positioning, 
  pulling is more necessary than simply ""I press button, every mob goes boom"".

I won't go into enhancement and PvP because those topics are subjective. SEA Server is absolute dogshit and I'd like to sue the South East Asia Developers for giving us only 11 channels when EU has 20+ channels. Every other server is fine, and I'd recommend this if you're looking for the best ""non-raid, full grinder"" MMO currently.

Even if it wasnt a struggle to get this game to work right from the start, with abysmal configuration menu that completely FUBAR's your setup, dosent save it so you have to input in the same changes every time you load, and even alters your systems setup video information to add icing on that cake, I would rate this at less then ZERO. Some aspects of the setup menu you cant even save until you reach a certain level? What genius came up with that? 

The game is HIGHLY monetized and advertised to money grab you right out of the gate, they dont even have the decency to wait until end game to dig their hands right into your pockets. Ads for buffs and upgrades are all over your screen as soon as you finish the intro vid. 

The combat system is garbage IMHO, half of the skills you can add to a hotbar, the rest just float somewhere and you can only utilize them through hotkeys or combos. Remapping these is impossible so you cant even come up with a method other then the default to soften the agony of learning all of these ridiculous key shortcuts. -Note some of the actual KEYS in the shortcuts you can remap, however, you cannot change the sequence or shorten it to something you feel is less annoying. 

NPC interaction is laughable with over-animated NPC's waiving their arms around like they are swatting flies during conversations, and some dont even move their lips as they talk. Graphics are so-so nothing to really awe over and I would say average at best. 

The lore and storyline is drab and boring, painfully obvious that it was thrown in just so the devs can claim its there. 

Dont be fooled by the base cost of the game even if its only a dollar you will most likely feel ripped off after just a few hours of gameplay. The game was engineered to suck money out of your wallet and dosent offer much else. If you really want to grind mobs and thats your thing, your better off with a decent map clearing game like Diablo or POE.
