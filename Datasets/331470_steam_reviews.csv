But beyond that, this game could easily be priced at $5-10 and be worthwhile.  While the first hour or so made me want to beat my head against a wall for all the ""Woe is me, everyday is so hum drum."" blah blah that is the general setup to sooooo many of these stories, the actual writing and art and music were all rather good so I stuck with it.  Once I got past the tropey introductions of the different characters and got to the meat of the storyline for some of the girls is where I got to the point where I could say the game is worth $5-$10.

One of the things I appreciated was that the ""Bad"" end I got on the path with my first girl was still really fulfilling since it involved a conflict between two of the girls that I felt reflected the choices I had made rather accurately, and made me want to play again and try to figure out the deeper layers of the overall story.  Then there's the novelty of the Russian setting, which I know I haven't experienced before from this sort of game, so it was fun getting little tidbits about Soviet ice cream and having Borsch served for meals.

Sadly, it didn't do it for me. I only played 30 min before giving up. Anime breasts popping up everywhere triggered my anime-breast-sensitive epilepsy I think. Wish they put a warning.

Ok, the story is fairly immersive from the start, the graphics are beautiful and atmospheric, and the concept interesting, but the text needs to be edited to the point where it is cut down by at least half. That being said, if you persevere you can get into the flow (and eventully encounter big friendly anime breasts)

My understanding of this game's storyline is: 'man feels his life is hopeless but something surreal happens and he can now meet all these stereotypical women whose sole purpose is to change his life and maybe shag him'. 

Tear jerker.

After 20min, The poorly edited text is too draining, and my anime-breast-epilepsy too easily triggered; it is hard to keep my interest in the storyline, since the story line is 'how many hot girls can I fall in love with -and shag?'

It's a shame cause I don't mind sexual content in game, but the sexual content in Everlasting Summer feels sneaky and pointless. I read somewhere the game's explicit sexual content had to be removed to be on Steam, which probably messed with how the game should feel as a whole, and would explain why I was so confused and seizing while playing it. Maybe on a different platform this game would have been advertised as a ponographic or erotica game (with a good old 'all the interchangeable women who changed my life when they shagged me' story in it).

So, random anime girls whose sole, deep desire is to shag you, just because your sad self fell asleep on a bus? Yes.

Complex story about the meaning of life and love? Not sure, but I'm still seizing.

I know a lot of people got hooked on the story and alternative endings, and I respect that, I just know that's not going to be me. Looking forward to trying more visual novels, just not this one.",1485372626,1485372835,False,6,1,0.53338623046875,1,True,False,False

The protagonist is thoroughly unlikeable. He has no interests, no qualities other than awkwardness, and no desire to do...anything, really, other than posting on image boards and whining about how boring his life is. If that's supposed to make him relatable, I think I'm insulted.

The music and art are excellent, and the game captures the Soviet feel very well. That's about all it has going for it.",1485235098,1485235098,False,9,0,0.528919339179992676,0,True,False,False

Visual novels tend to not have the therapeutic effect I'm after. Indeed, I had my doubts about this game as soon as I read the disclaimer about suicide. Oh well, whatever, right!? Violence is often glorified these days... nothing out of the ordinary here, I thought.

On my first lap I got the 'Lena, bad end'. 
On my second lap I started aiming for the 'Lena, good end', but got distracted and stumbled upon 'Semyon, good end' instead. That cleared up a few things.

If you can look past the naive and suggestive graphics, the completely different -extreme - outcomes possible from seemingly innocent choices make this visual novel interesting. Whether it's actually good or not, I can't make up my mind. At least, the music and background art is good.

By recommending it to you, I hope that you and I will have this common experience to relate to if we happen to end up in the same mental ward or insane asylum.",1485039377,1485039415,True,5,1,0.519841313362121582,0,True,False,False
