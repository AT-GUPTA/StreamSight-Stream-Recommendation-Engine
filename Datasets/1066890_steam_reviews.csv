And it all comes down to the point, because people are jerks. And this game does not punish misbehaving (or not to a degree that prevents this bad actions). So they do it again and again, and again.
There is no point in trying to engage a race seriously, because after the 1st lap you have to pit or end the race somewhere in the wall.
If you like to play against AI or try to beat fastest times on tracks, this sim is absolutely awesome.

Recently, I have been driving with AC, there are really amazing tracks when compared to AMS2. It is weird that AC community can produce excellent road and circuit tracks (which look amazing, too), but Reiza can't seem to produce that same amount.

Pros:
+ VR GUI works good.
+ Interesting tracks and cars. 
+ RX is great
+ Feels great with Fanatec podium DD1. 
+ VR performance quite ok. 
+ Cars feel fantastic and handle very well. 
+ AI races have been amazing fun, works great.
+ Good variety of cars. 

Cons:
- There could be more tracks
- You can't mark your favorite cars and tracks, there are no ""Favourites"" lists

If you wonder whether you should get this (AMS2), Assetto Corsa (AC), or Assetto Corsa Competizione (ACC): get them all. You can get the base games dirt cheap. I actually like ACC best for what it offers: the perfect GT3 driving experience. However, AMS2 has so many great vehicle classes and tracks that you definitely need it. I love the new Le Mans Hypercar DLC.

Pros:
* Great selection of cars and tracks, you can drive almost everything!
* Good UI and menus.
* Very nice driving and physics. Feels a bit floaty to me, but this can be improved dramatically by changing camera settings.
* Developers regularly release great new content for very fair prices and deserve support!

Neutral:
* For multiplayer, obviously that subscription service is #1, but I'm not much of a multiplayer racer and it's way too expensive, so I am fine with this.

Bad (I have discovered nothing major yet):
* minor: The [i]floaty[/i] feeling maybe, but it's really not that bad and I got used to it pretty quickly. It may not even be noticeable for new players, most likely it's just the difference to ACC, my standard simulator.
* minor: It would be cool if it had single player challenges and achievements to unlock like AC (but ACC also does not have that).

I Have been playing this since Early access, It has had its ups and downs but tonight after driving the GTE's around the nurburgring I am blown away with how much this has improved.

The Positives:
Cars feel between good and amazing. 
Lots of different content so you can race a lot more than GT3's.
FFB is Good.
Graphics are very good,
UI is capable.
Has a rating system.
Rain simulation is great.
The weather changes are great
Time of day changes are amazing.
You can drive mods now!

The Negatives:
Online is still a fiddly...
Its not supported by LFM and it doesn't have as many online players as iRipoff but you can join a league and sort that out yourself and it wont cost you any money...  
Replays are limited.
Liveries are kind of -meh- but now you can upload custom ones which make the cars look great!

What I want in this game:

>Charade Circuit
>Reims-Gueux
>Montjuïc circuit

>Rouen-Les-Essarts
>Sepang International Circuit

>Lemans New

Cars:
>1950 F1
>Legendary touring cars from the 60s
>old lemans cars
>Britcar cars like the praga r1

Fixed
>More streetcars (Kinda)

Game:
>Snow on all tracks (recently played Project Cars 2, so maybe you guys could copy and tune the physics of that)
>AI learning
>Freecam for the hole map.
>Customizable camera positions. So you can make camera positions.
>In replay mode not switching from onboard camera, I want to precisly choose which onboard camera. 
>More realistic raindrops on windscreen, if it will be possible let it be an option to choose wether you want it to look good or not. So you can still get good fps for the ones with worse hardware. I would like to see the raindrops like in assetto corsa(modded).
>Crashed ai drivers be longer on the track (to be adjustable)
  
Fixed(Kind of)
>More realistic interior, texture wise
>Customizable Ai grid Skins and names and country etc. (Kinda)

What needs to be fixed from what i've played:
?>FUSA part 2, laguna seca 29th car driving in the gravel on start. (aggression 100, strength 100)
?>F1 Reiza cutting the first corner at Eau Rouge this way they bumb their car into the wall and slamming into the Tyres, This also happens when aggression is 75%. Not sure if this is with other cars.
>Replay buttons not reacting. only after a few seconds.
>If you disable your wipers and turn them off after a while, it only removes half of the raindrops, instead of all of them.
>If there is rain and you have your wipers slowly on, the rain will also be slowly on the windscreen and if you turn your wipers faster, the rain will also appear faster.
?>Formula Ultimate gen 2. If the back wing is missing from crash. The lights of the wing are still there, so the lights are floating in the air.
>Formula Ultimate gen 2. When crashing on new Spa. Tyres are off the car, but fisually still there when I crash.
?>Oval racing. Cars are sometimes hovering over the track.
  
Fixed
>Missing grass first corner on Montreal 1988
>If you crash and your tyre went flying off and you watch the replay and then go restart the race, you still miss your tyre visualy.

The multiplayer layout is intuitive and easy to navigate. I'm so pleased to see the ""old"" lobbies of multiplayer sim racing.

The graphics and cars are nice and I felt like I was FINALLY getting my money's worth out of this sim after being an early supporter and paying $99.99 + tax for what I thought was all future DLC.  Now when you look at the $99 package it states 2020-22. Well that's not what it said when I purchased it a few years ago.  It promised all future DLC and updates.  
Now that the sim is finally enjoyable to drive and they are starting to put out some actual DLC I want, they want me to pay $9.99 for a few cars and then ANOTHER $9.99 for one damn track?  I paid $99 early on to drive some crappy go carts and wierd car classes I had NO intrest in, simply because I believed in the vision Reiza was selling for this sim.  Now that they are gaining some attention they seem to have pivoted to the bait and switch business model and have started gouging their loyal customers that have been here from the beginning. Disgusting!  What's next, the pay for everything a la cart and a stupid monthly subscription like the pathetic i-racing?  Totally disappointed in this blatant gouging. Especially after being given the new stuff for a couple days and now having it taken back and held for ransom! Well I'm sorry to tell you reiza, those few cars and ONE track are not worth another $20!  I just CAN'T stomach the idea of paying $9.99 for ONE DAMN TRACK !!  Piss off!!!

UPDATE!!!!!!!!
As of 8/27/22, I decided to retry this game after a long hiatus and BOY what a difference!  I just drove the formula ultimate around the 2022 version of SPA and the track is an absolute MASTERPIECE!  The handling of the formula car is infinitely better to drive than the actual official F1 game from CM.  I did also drive many of the other cars and tracks and will have to say I am incredibly impressed with the work Rieza has done the improve this game since I last played it.  Well done and keep up the good work!  I totally recommend this game now.

Original review from 2021--
Utter GARBAGE!!!!!!! if you like spending ALL of your time screwing around with settings because the developer was too lazy to create a proper physics model and FFB, then this is the game for you! If you actually like racing and driving in a sim you best look elsewhere. literally have to mess with all FFB settings for each car you try to drive. I am NOT new to driving sims and know how to generally set a car up when it needs a tweak, but these models are just SOOOOOO far off it is not even remotely fun! Wait about another year until their beta test they are charging for is over. Then, you MIGHT have a tolerable sim.

Few things that stand out :
Very few online servers, found 8 yesterday (22 April) and only 1 today.

Physics, feel fine as far as i can determine. ( i am a compter racing veteran sinds the 80's.)
Graphics, fine. I run the game on high settings, not everything maxed out.
Sound, fine. Loved some of the outside view sound, really deep and realistic in my opinion.

I do hope there will be more servers available. There are already too many racing games out there, spreading the quite small community. I fear the worst for online play.


Edit 7th sept 2020:

Negatives:
It shares a lot of issues with project cars 2, check out my review on that one for more details.
Replay function sucks, to name a thing.
These things seriously irritate me and i wish their was a neutral recommendation button here.
The only reason i recommend it is because of the actual driving.


Edit 21 sept 2023:

Replay function still sucks bigtime.
Online serverlist has improved over the years, there is more to select from. 
I do admit i came back to this sim finding a lot of immersion, albeit offline because i like certain mods that no server seems to host.
For some reason i am able to ""create"" a setup in most cases. Why did i never understand this in simracing when i was really active, back in 2005?!?!?
It's not like power/coast settings, bumps, gear ratios and such have been recently added to racingsims.

Edit 7 jan 2024:
BAD: 
Still cannot race online with my own name instead of nickname. 
Replay function sucks still.
AI has serious issues still, even though it has been improved. Offline championship no feasible thing for me personally.
Sharing of setups still missing/problematic.

GOOD:
Immersion of actual personal driving is incredible.
Audio, some DLC is very much an eardrum massage in my opinion.

Automobilista 2 is my favorite simracing game. It has a wide vaiority of tracks and cars. From GT's to Formula cars and from old F1's to modern F1 2022 cars. It has all kinds of weather variations and enough room to do 24 hours and multi-class races. The online lobbies are good but could be better, ill talk more about that later. The game runs very smoothly on my PC, the best running sim game I have to be honest. If you liked Project CARS 2 you will like this. It's upgraded in everyway specificly physics.

[b]My Wishlist[/b]

While this game is great, there are still things I wish for this game.

I miss a competitive online lobby system. I would like a system similar to Gran Tourismo 7 where there are daily online races. Similar to the current daily time trails, but races instead where you get matched up with people with similar rating.

I also miss some cool tracks I would love to drive in this game.

1. Bahrain - It's a great track and not many sim titles actually have this track, I think this game could benefit by being one of the few games that has this popular track.

2. Yas Marina/Abu Dhabi - It's the same deal with Bahrain.

3. Circut of the Americas/Cota - To complete the USA track's togheter with Indianapolis Road Course.

I also miss one specific car class. A proper modern Touring Car Class. It would be great to complete multi-class combos such as the classic GT3 + GT4 + TC and just driving Touring Cars alone is great. I know about the TSI class which would almost be great if it wasn't because of the only 1 race livery per vehicle and rest being single color civilian skins.

I small thing I also would want is a way to set a custom grid such as you can do in rFactor 2. That you can pick a specific vehicle and livery manually because some of the classes right now are weird if you want to do multi-class. Such as P1, I don't feel like the non Ginetta car's feel like LMP1's so it would be great if you could pick specific cars for the AI in a race.

Quote from 1.5.5.0 ""Slightly increased the likelihood of AI making a mistake during braking when under pressureDisabled AI half-spin mistakes on corner exit"".
Too bad that the half-spin mistakes were disabled. It happens in real racing as everybody makes mistakes, and it can happen even to the best, so it would be great to leave it.


Beautiful graphics - Advanced physics - Fun game-play - Tons of tracks and cars

The game is suitable for beginners but also enjoyable for advanced drivers. Supports several modes from single race, championship, test day, multiplayer races, online events, public time trials. Really good AI that is fun to race against (of course it could be a bit improved). It would be nice and more fun for AI to make more mistakes (crashes) in lower tier races, as this is usually where more inexperienced drivers start. As of writing this review there is no official career mode (highly wanted), there is an excellent mod Racing Life.
Additionally, it would be nice to have some sort of ranking system.

-The physics are solid, the cars are fun to drive, though also a bit on the floaty side, and they're definitely forgiving.
-Graphics are good, including in VR. It helps that there's a day-night cycle and rain.
-Sounds are nothing impressive, but not bad either.
-Racing against the AI is better than in most other sims. They still have their questionable moments, but this is defintely one of this game's strong points.
-The car roster is decent. There's a bit of everything, but some classes are better off than others. If you like oldschool F1, 90s Indycar/CART (sequential era), 90s GT1, Brazilian racing and karting, you'll be quite happy. Other classes like DPi, LMP1-3, GTE, 90s DTM feel more lacking, and that's especially true if you like oldschool sportscar racing, where the game could benefit a lot from more cars.
-The track list is nice, but there are a few tracks missing like Sebring, Road Atlanta, Zolder and Fuji. Still a good selection though, and what's there is of high quality.
Do note that if you're playing this in early january, the Le Mans expansion with the LMDh and new GT3 cars is only temporarily free. You will have to buy it later. It is not included with any version you're purchasing here.

I have been playing the new Endurance Pack Pt1 for AMS2 all day today since it went live this morning, I Bought AMS2 early 2023. I am a pretty big ACC fan so I didn't really pay much attention to AMS2 at launch and when I first bought AMS2 it didn't feel to good so I kind of ignored it most of the year as you can see I have only put about 30 hours into it since I got It.

Well i can finally say that is about to change since version 1.5 AMS2 has become one of my favorite Sim Racing games both in and out of VR the visuals are beautiful the cars look amazing the track side detail is above and beyond a lot of the competition I highly recommend AMS2 The prices are fair and the content is really high quality. 

The Force Feedback is incredible I am currently using the 8NM Fanatec DD Pro with the Clubsport universal hub V2 and it feels great I also use the CAMMUS 5NM C5, 8NM LP8 & 15NM DDWB21 for AMS2 all these wheel bases feel great with it.

Good to see some recent cars and the Le Mans. I am changing my review to recommend but it's still not rF2 quality FFB. AI is improved. 
But it neither has good multiplayer nor can you save mid session in single player. So ""Endurance Pack"" is not actually going to make Endurance Races much popular.

Older Review - 

1.5 is little too hyped, the FFB sucks as before, just a lot of automatic counter-steer added, you still not feel the rubber like you do in rFactor2, it's the same plastic tyres. AI is slightly faster. It's not a game changer. This PhD project is going too long.

Reiza has been working hard to get updates out and while the game is still buggy and the physics is still wonky, I can't deny that these folk are passionate about their project. I also can't deny that it [b]REALLY[/b] delivers in some parts, especially on recreations of vintage layouts of tracks which is something not many other games do with official support.
Buy when discounted and you won't really regret it.

[h1]Physics[/h1]
I have never driven a real car fast, let alone a real race car with real race tyres on a real race track. However, I do believe I have a decent idea of how a car should drive when a game is said to be a simulator.
AMS2 to me falls in this weird halfway point, it's not an arcade game, but I also can't call it a simulator.

Slip angles are high no matter the tyres. You can just throw the car into a turn, be mildly careful with the throttle, mind the steering a bit, and you can take turns incredibly fast without much effort at all. I can see running 0 TC being the META since even at the lowest setting it cuts power way too early, but for some reason it underperforms at low speeds. The new LMDh cars seem to have this somewhat sorted though, so it's likely they'll keep working on this.

[u]It is incredibly fun mind you[/u], and the grip now isn't as high as it was with 1.5.0 so you can't abuse the tyres as much as before without being penalized, but it all still feels a bit too vague and floaty, almost like you're running pretty low tyre pressures. Another downside is that sometimes the car just turns its grip off and that can feel a bit frustrating, but once you can get the hang of that it is fun to push.

[h1]Cost[/h1]
The 2020-2022 season pass seems to finally have run its course, sadly.
The new Formula Hi-Tech and new classical tracks need to be purchased separately and there isn't a bundle or season pass that includes them either. The future of paying for content is being discussed with the community, but we still don't really know how it will be.

When it comes to tracks, if you don't buy the expansion packs, the base game doesn't have some of the more well known ones that most people will want to race on.

The car list situation is a bit better thankfully, but what can you do with those cars if you don't own the tracks you want to drive on? You really need both so try to get the season pass when you buy this game.

[u]It is not the most expensive racing game out there[/u], but I also don't feel like the current asking price of around $120 is that good. Especially now that we're likely going to see another season pass or, worse, the need to buy new stuff separately.
I honestly don't remember specifics, but I wouldn't be surprised if PCARS 2 had more content, for both cars and tracks, for considerably less. And that game also was less buggy and felt like a more complete and tested piece of software. It is likely that AMS2 will keep on getting more content as time goes though, so it's worth keeping a eye out for that.

[b]Online[/b] still has those weird bugs where lobbies can't be started and different people get different assists settings. Other than that it's okay I guess and it is fairly active.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I don't regret buying this game (I got it with a bfriday discount), and with 1.5 I have actually started to play it a fair bit more because the cars now have some semblance of contact with the road surface, but in a way that also raises more red flags... While 1.5.3 is nicer, I still feel like these fixes are coming a little too late.
It has cars and tracks you don't really see anywhere else (maybe in AC mods but the quality of those is a dice roll) and if you can look over the rough bits of this game it is an enjoyable experience.",1691909050,1704047694,True,0,0,0.493392080068588257,0,True,False,False

In AMS2, Cars are sometimes ghostet, or they drive in groups of 3-10 cars, what sounds exciting, but it's not like real racing. The AI is just not able to overtake and pull away.
I can't recommend this game. I know, they work on it, but problems of day one haven't been solvet now. Unstead they release many DLC's.

Some cars are absolutely amazing to drive (Formula HiTech); the AI is very good and can even overtake you around the outside and battle through multiple corners. VR is very good as well, and the multiplayer with AI and only the host having to own the tracks is awesome.

However, some cars, especially the newer F1 cars (around 2010 onwards), are so weird that I seriously doubt they are on the same tyre model (they apparently are). It makes no sense that a modern F1 car is as slidey as they are in here. I should never be able to just go full throttle from a standstill and drive in a straight line without even having my hands on the wheel. And that is really unfortunate because AMS1 really nailed those cars, in my opinion. GT cars are also too slidey but not as bad as the F1 cars.

The game is also suffering from a lot of the same issues as Project Cars, which is not that surprising considering they are on the same engine. Especially collisions and flips cause the engine to completely freak out and produce hilarious and unrealistic crashes. If the roof or side of the car touches the ground, prepare to go from 200 to 0 basically immediately. The UI is also in need of refinement. Why are the brake bias, TC change, etc. change messages presented as a list? I can never tell which message is the most recent one.

As it stands, I can only genuinely recommend AMS2 if you are either into obscure Brazilian racing series, low-powered cars, or older F1 cars. Most modern cars just handle way too strangely for me to recommend AMS2 over other sims.",1585995738,1703180574,False,8,2,0.460087805986404419,0,True,False,False

An excellent racing game with fantastic driving, a great ai, and custom championships. Plus it even works without internet. 
Can't think of anything negative to say. 

The longer version 
I played this game a few years ago and wasn't impressed, the driving wasn't great and neither was the ai. But I've got to say, it's improved significantly in both of those areas. This is becoming my favorite racing game and I've played nearly all of them. 

There is of course plenty of room to grow, like the racing life mod, I would love for that to be actually part of this game. And safety cars and an improved pit crew would be nice, and a racing engineer giving you updates and feedback would be awesome. 

As it is, the driving is great and I've driven quite a few classes now, it is challenging and realistic. 
The AI will race you and challenge you, it is great fun. If I wasn't a terrible driver, I'd feel like Schumacher out there haha. 
Custom championships are huge for me and this game nails it. 
I really don't have anything negative to say about this game. But if more of these little touches I mentioned earlier were added, this game would be over the top. 

I strongly recommend this game for any petrol head out there. 

To the devs 
I've got to say thanks for this gem of a racing game. Years ago I gave this game a thumbs down review, but thanks to your hard work and supporting this game, that is no longer the case.

To make things short.. THIS IS A RACING GAME and or SIMULATOR 

  After the latest major update, i decided to give it a shot and DAMN and YES!!!
started with stock car lol some boat, with a  big V8,  I noticed how much grip i have and how my wheel is easily able to translate ""relax son.. you're about to over steer"" and especially in under steer, It gives me that detail i need to correct the issue before I slam into an opponent or wall, Also in my experience as of now the AI on GT3 and GT4 are amazing, when it comes to Formula AI. I dont know if its because I'm not 100% confident or just the nature of the beast driving Formulas but, the AI are pretty aggressive lol but damn.. do i love it because i learn on how to start a 20 plus lap race and not try and go ham out of the dig.

  The force feedback in my opinion is the best out of the other games/ sim i own. Each car has its own different feel and especially felt  the difference when jumping from different Formula cars.
The racing is amazing.. and its a trip especially in VR which i'll get back to VR in a different paragraph.
The racing while on a monitor is trippy because it doesn't feel cinematic at all, it feels raw and what i mean by that is as your passing an opponents car and especially on a tight corner, you can see that your pulling away but at the same time you can see your opponent giving its all to stay beside you till the next corner and of course. If you did your part and have a solid line, your over take will feel amazing.

   Now this all changes as you start racing with faster vehicles like Formulas. at that point, its gonna start feeling like you want to take it easy because its super easy to make a mistake and watch the car just turn into confetti.
As for the physics, yes its a massive jump and i love it. I love it more then ACC 0.0 You can feel when your front tires are on full grip as long as you did your part with braking and steering in, 100% you will need to learn trail braking and once you learn it, you can experiment with different corners/ cars / speeds with harder braking and letting go, but for sure learn trail braking.
  As for VR. Ill start with saying that things have to get changed in the files of VR within the game, its only two values but unfortunately its seems like there's an issue with Devs in w.e racing game not knowing whats a good base value for the clearest picture.
  Once you set the two values, the VR is just amazing. overtaking and hard battling just throws me in a roller coaster mood lol
  Its a beautiful thing to be able to look towards the corner and threw the apex, or as your cornering and have an opponent attempt an over take as your just staring him down from the mirror or if they manage to get beside you. The VR is where its at on this Game/ sim but i really wish and hope the Devs look into this issue with VR sharpening and Bias values for the new guys that dont feel comfortable going in to change values. In all honesty =/ it should be ready to go as soon as we pop our head set on and the only things i can see us having the responsibility to change is our fidelity  depending on our systems spec.

  All in all as of now, and as long as the Devs keep it going on the corrections and content updates, this is the game/ sim to own if you want to have a beautiful racing experience and more importantly, if you're looking to understand and improve in sim racing, this is the one in my honest opinion.",1701811683,1701811683,True,12,1,0.612249255180358887,0,True,False,False

so after the latest big update where improvements to both the physics and ai were a major focus i reinstalled ams2 to give it a try - and boy i wasn't disappointed. the ai cars are now much more aware of human drivers and are very competitive and will take advantage of any small error without being reckless. when you race against ai that is your level they are now very difficult to pass. this makes the racing an absolute joy - without the annoyance of reckless idiot racers you get online

the physics have also improved and the cars i've tried are fantastic to drive. reiza have excelled themselves and after a year or more of not racing i now just can't stop. this is the racing sim i've always wanted and now finally have. i just can't recommend this sim highly enough particularly for those who are primarily interested in racing ai. it blows away every other sim i've tried in that regard",1701730913,1701730913,True,41,0,0.770926237106323242,0,True,False,False

So I haven't actually gotten to play it thanks to this, but I consider proper multi screen support an absolute requirement for any modern driving simulator. 
This has been requested for years as far as I can google. I'll update my review if they decide to support monitors better, i.e. just add an ability to add a negative offset like in iRacing.
(Also, the initial loading screen takes ages to clear).
If there's anything I've missed please let me know.

This game is huge and amazingly detailed, a true simulator that allows you to drive dozens of different cars in a variety of tracks, letting you customize your race all the way down to a historical date. And that's without any DLC.

The variety of cars and tracks is very good, as it lets you drive Formula cars, GT, go karts, old VW beetles.

On the down side, this is a ""sim"" more than a ""game"", and a bunch of the bells and whistles I'd expect from a racing game are missing. There's no winner's podium shot, no ""career"" mode or managing a team, no spilling Champagne while a voluptuous blonde hugs you, etc. But the physics and the responsive driving overcome any such shortcoming imo and there are no unlocks and no grinding, you get access to everything from the start.

Just got the complete edition during the recent sale after seeing a vid on YT by Dan DiMaggio Sim Racing, took a chance and I'm blown away at how much has been fixed/tweaked with the 1.5.3 update.

Performance is fantastic (getting 170 FPS), the cars actually move around naturally now, are more predictable/unique between classes and no more Madness engine axis issue. The FFB and AI improvements are the cherry on top!

I don't know how you did it on such a mediocre engine but you clearly have more passion and skill than Slightly Mad ever had. Ian Bell is a snake oil salesman, you people are legit.

Again, thanks for sticking with it, another sim racer to play is always welcome! 👍

And now it finally became what we all hoped it will be - one of the most advanced and versatile sims on the market. So why you should buy it (Reiza offer good discounts every major Steam sale so if the money is tight, just wait till the next Steam sale) and why it decrowned ACC in my personal list? 
[list]
    [*][b]Best weather system and seasons.[/b] Not only it has all possible weather presets from a sunny day to a thunderstorm, you can also set a historical weather from the last 40 years. The weather implementation is the best I’ve seen - it can rain over a part of the track while the other track will be completely dry, the changes in weather are seamless and feel very natural. Also every track comes with a pack of seasonal textures (except snow), the trees and grass change colours, deciduous trees loose their leaves in winter and so on. These details just add up so much to immersion.
    [*][b]Best real road implementation.[/b] AMS2 has a true dynamic real road: the rubber accumulates where the tires are loaded the most, the marbles outside the racing line are both visible and perceptible through the steering wheel. Dirt can be brought to the track and it affects the grip. When rain starts the rubbered line becomes slippery, then rubber gets washed away. And after the rain stops the racing line dries out first. Puddles are forming if the rain is strong enough, they then stay much longer on the track even if the sun dries out most of the track and you can get caught pretty badly on your slick tires. The possibilities of track conditions are pretty much endless. It is also worth mentioning that Reiza sorted out the puddles behaviour and they are not as deadly as in Project Cars.
    [*][b]Best Force Feedback.[/b] After the September update the FFB feels as good as it was in the AMS1. It’s fast, very responsive, you always know that the car is doing. AMS2 is the only sim where I can catch the slides using the FFB and I can feel the moment when the tires are having grip again (as it is IRL) and not just trying to guess the moment (it is like this in all other sims for me, I have non-DD Fanatec CSL Elite wheel).
    [*][b]Amazing AI.[/b] Reiza fixed the AI provided by the pCars engine, there’s no jerkiness in their behaviour, AI is predictable and competitive. AI cars don’t hesitate when there’s a gap, but still manage to keep it safe. They can attack you and each other or choose the defending line when they feel threatened. They make errors and every AI driver has their own behaviour and skills level, which makes racing against AI much more realistic and immersive. Of course it's not perfect, the performance in different conditions my vary, especially during changes from dry to wet and vice versa. But it’s still a very enjoyable experience to drive against AI, AMS2 probably has the best AI of all non subscription-based sims on the market. 
    [*][b]Physics are great.[/b] There's a lot of controversy about AMS2 physics. Many say it's same s pCars 2, and even though that was never completely true, in the first years the similarities were quite obvious. But after the patch 1.5.0 that came out in July '23 everything has changed - Reiza fixed the long term issue in tyre physics calculations in Madness engine which was the main reason for the floaty behaviour. And since the version 1.5.3 (came out in November 23) the debates are over. The cars behaviour is predictable, you can feel the weight distribution and the moment the tyres lose grip very well. You can still slide the cars and these slides are pretty controllable to some extent (as irl in fact), but that now costs you laptime and tyre live as it should. And that's just a hell lot of fun to search the car's limit in AMS2 because the game communicates very well on where the limit is.
    [*][b]Graphics are amazing and the engine is very well optimised.[/b] Even with a relatively old systems you can get great visual experience and won’t have to sacrifice graphics for performance a lot. I’ve heard the VR performance is the best (can’t confirm myself though). 
    [*][b]Great sounds.[/b] I don’t know what kind of sorcery Reiza have done with the Madness engine, but the sounds are just amazing and have nothing in common with the pCars. That’s just another league really. Still not on par with RRE and ACC though, but a very good effort overall. 
    [*][b]Damage modelling and mechanical failures.[/b] This is the most advanced sim in this regard really. You can set up damage from visual-only all the way up to the realistic levels when a slight contact with a wall can end up your race. If you abuse the car it can (and will) break. And a very nice addition is random failures you can turn on, there’s nothing more satisfying than seeing your rival having an engine failure in the end of the race. But beware, next time it can be your engine. xD Also tire flat-spotting implementation is the best on the market, you can literally ruin your tire in the first corner and suffer the lost of grip and feel vibrations through the FFB all race long, these vibrations will intensify when you load the flat-spotted tire more. As IRL, a flat-spotted tire will tend to lock up again and again making the situation even worse. Simply amazing!
    [*][b]Huge variety of cars.[/b] It has every single F1 era, slower Formula cars, a great amount of GT cars from the old GT1 to modern GT3, GT4 and GTE (all are amazing), prototypes, road legal cars, trucks, karts, rally cross cars and much more! 
    [*][b]Great amount of high quality tracks.[/b] Unlike the predecessor, AMS2 provides a big amount of A grade tracks (make sure you also purchase the Premium Track Pack DLC with the base game). The quality of the tracks is great. What differs Reiza from the other game devs is that they also provide a high quality renditions of the legacy layouts. So you can drive old timers on the tracks they belong to. 
[/list]
But of course not everything is so great, here’s the negatives:
[list]
    [*]Multiplayer is the biggest issue atm. The net code is actually pretty good, you can have some close battles without the risk of being punted by a ghost. But that’s pretty much all positive about it. The lobby browser is terrible, you cannot filter out full or inaccessible servers/lobbies. When you find a lobby to join, sometimes the game glitches and you cannot start the race. The assists like ABS or TC being randomly disallowed even though the server allows them. Hopefully Reiza will put a lot of efforts into multiplayer this year, this is the main reason the sim doesn’t get the attention it deserves.
    [*]Every big update requires you to reset setups, re-assign controls and change settings. At least it’s been like this in the past years. Not a big deal but is somewhat annoying. 
    [*]The quality of the content is inconsistent. The older base game content can be twitchy, some cars have FFB, physics or sound issues. But this stuff gets more and more rare as Reiza slowly iron these problems out.  
[/list]
That’s pretty much it. As a conclusion of this way-too-long-review I can say that AMS2 is a must-have for every racing fan. It’s already in a great shape and getting better and better with every update. At some point in the future (with no ETA though) the multiplayer issues will be addressed and a long awaited career mode will be added alongside with many fun DLCs (Le Mans! <3) which will make the game even more versatile and comprehensive.

Yes, it is basically Project Cars 2.5. Same engine, same structure (no career mode though), same underlying feel, same varied content from karts to trucks, from GTs to historic prototypes.
Where AMS2 stands head and shoulders above PC2 and the competition though, is the amount of tracks available, with historic layouts (and time-accurate spectators and cars on the sidelines) so you can actually immerse yourself in racing in a 1960s-1970s car.
Sounds are much better than a lot of competitors, and the handling is really nice, even on a controller. Which both is a far cry from what Project Cars 2 had to offer, unfortunately. What is similar though, is the easy setup and enjoyable multiclass racing. 
I just love multiclass racing with GTs and Prototypes. And there just aren't that many offline racing games that can deliver that experience, especially not with a smooth day-night cycle and dynamic weather. PC2 could and did scratch that itch for me, for several hundreds of hours, but I ironically never enjoyed the physics anywhere near as much as Assetto Corsa or Raceroom. But those games couldn't offer what I mentioned above, the quick and easy setup of endurance racing or just casual driving on the Nordschleife at night. 
AMS2 is THAT game though. And while I feel like it would be nice to have more licensed cars overall but especially in GT3 and the Prototypes, certainly some hybrids would be amazing with Le Mans (which I suspect WILL come in the near future), what is there now offers a large variety and potential for hundreds of hours of enjoyable racing.

OK this sim has improved quite a lot from my original thoughts below, I would say this game is very much worth getting if you want to setup races with AI and have a great time. The driving force feedback has improved substantially along with the tires and suspension. Its still not perfect but a big improvement none the less bringing it closer to rFactor2 but maybe with a slightly more slippery tire and very slow car rotation. But It will make you feel like a racing god so it achieves the main thing I look for in a sim, the enjoyment you get driving a race car. 

Old review below:

I keep reinstalling this game after hearing its improved multiple times including the latest build on the 10th of June 2023. Coming from years of driving Assetto Corsa 1 in leagues and a few years of ranked racing in iRacing with a full on sim rig with a high end direct drive Wheel I feel that I now ave some experience with other titles to compare. 
This Game its still very bad from a simulator point of view. The tire physics make no sense, the force feedback is mushy with harsh roar bumps and the cars floats all over the track like the cars have worn out rose joints and suspension. The car catalogue is a mess for driving quality. 
Also the servers are dead even when everyone saying this game is amazing. With so many sims that drive better like AC1, rFactor2, RaceRoom and even ACC, iRacing I cannot recommend this Title, this sim only offers nice graphics and if you like more single player arcade like driving games this might be for you.",1686370316,1701080549,True,0,0,0.530933380126953125,2,True,False,False

- You can set up multiplayer lobbies with friends without downloading separate software.
- Has a dedicated server option for multiplayer if you desire.
- You can race multiplayer with your friend + AI.
- You have dozens and dozens of tracks and cars to choose from.
- There's no monthly subscription.
- You can set weather by historical date or force your friends to drive in a thunderstorm.
- Adjustable force feedback per car as well as a good baseline configuration.
- Car radar to show if you're close to someone else.
- Adjustable HUD as well as UDP support (works great with Simhub).
- Some early modding support (Not AC level, but you can swap in cars and tracks).
- The graphics engine is the same as Project Cars 2, so although it's not peak graphics, it's also not a game engine from 2003.
- The physics are forgiving while being adjustable with traction control, stability control, and ABS.
- Cars that have onboard adjustments in real-life get them here (GT cars with TCS/ABS, F1 cars with DRS, etc).
- Base game has a lot of tracks and cars to begin with.
- 2020-2022 season pass is fantastic value with more tracks than I can honestly remember how to drive.

This game is a great place to spend time playing historical cars on historical  tracks, and has been actively developed for a long time.

Update, December 2022: Still recommend, but the game still has lots of issues. AI is terribly inconsistent and appear to be driving with different physics. The multiplayer is far from stable as well. Needs much more work.

Update, December 2021: The devs continue improving the game. The new content is usually pretty good, and their fair with their pricing and release strategy. We got plenty of new content. But the original content is still not great. The physics of the game still feel fun, but wrong in certain ways. Go buy it now, great game! The devs fixed most of the weird stuff. It's still a WIP, but it's worth every penny even now.

Update, December 2020: It has gotten better! Ffb has improved, and the new cars all feel great. Still unfinished and unpolished, but we're on the right track now. The driving itself feels pretty good now for most cars. The only thing we're missing now is some proper netcode and collision physics and this game will be great in multiplayer too.

AMS2 was generally better at launch than those venerable (ACC?, Venerable?) titles. Over the last two years it has improved with each release to the point where detractors have simply not played its most recent incarnation. It did not help Jimmy Broadbent reviewed it recently through the lens of his previous experience with the title.
So here is my review: The multiplayer needs a search tool and more stability is needed in joining multiplayer on servers with poor specifications, but where it counts, the racing, it is already up there with the best of the competition. AMS2 is no longer ""AMS ported to PC2"" simcade. In fact, the version of the Madness Engine (ME) they use is six-generations newer than that used by PC2, so any comparisons of that kind show the ignorance of many reviews. The ME physics has been replaced, the ME AI has been replaced, most of the UI has been replaced. Opinions should now be replaced, too.

Update: Make sure you look at the custom FFB profiles on the Reiza forum. Unlike other sims, AMS2 allows creation of ffb profiles exactly the way you want them,",1640596255,1700704025,True,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Impressed that Reiza studios continues to iterate on and improve this game more than 3.5 years after release, Codemasters take note!

I've played most of the sim and so-called 'simcade' racing games out there going way back (Codies TOCA 1997 anyone) using PC tech and peripherals that of course can't compete with what we have today. More recent games would include Assetto Corsa, iRacing, Project Cars 1 and 2, F122, GRID series, Forza series, Beam.NG, Dirt Rally 1 and 2.
For the games that support it, I play in VR with a 2DOF motion platform, rumble, wind fans and a mid-range wheel and pedals.
Of course, every racing game has strengths and weaknesses. Some focus on the graphics, or objectives and stuff to do, others on variety of tracks and customisation and others on the physics/ realism.
Yes, AMS2 has its limitations - track-based only, no story/campaign and effectively not moddable so of course that's why I play other racing games as well - sometimes you want the flashy presentation, the adventure of an open world or a bit of arcade fun with friends.
But IMHO AMS2 is the sim that provides the best driving experience overall for the enthusiast, no mean feat in such a competitive arena, especially when working with what I would imagine is a relatively tight budget when compared with the big players.

Well done Reiza, keep on keeping on!

They fight each other and have different strengths and sometimes clash!  Only downside is the vanilla tracks, not really a downside more of the only thing I can think of that lets it down slightly, that there isn't a great selection of decent ones without buying DLC.

Automobilista 2
Assetto Corsa
Project Cars 2
F1 2022
Project Cars 1
Assetto Corsa Competizione (this one is really bad in VR)

EDIT: A few hours later.....! I have now ordered the rest of the DLC and the tracks are great including the American packs.  I've now downloaded CrewChief (highly recommended for free) and also a free program called Racing Life which is a career path for the game with sponsors and finance for the solo player!  If I'm still playing this at 100 hours I will order a Race Sim Cockpit and direct drive wheel and loadcell pedals. I will edit this again to my feedback on what that's like too!

EDIT2 (69hrs): Now having a Fanatec CSL DD wheel base and load cell pedals paired with the McLaren GT3 wheel on top of a GT Omega sim rig, along with a Dayton Audio BST-2 transducer under the seat and 2x Dayton Audio TT25 transducers on the pedals going through a Nobsound Amp this sim IS utterly, incredibly amazing.

👍 Quite a lot of content, without having to unlock anything.
👍 Physics are very realistic and in depth, with a slight simcade feel.
👍 Very realistic audio.
👍 The AI isn't too bad.
👍 Weather Dynamics are very good.

Neutral:
- A lot of the premium circuits are DLC, which is understandable.

Cons:
👎 The game lacks purpose.  No career or anything to unlock of any kind.  It's almost as if this is just a sandbox template for Private Online Leagues to utilise.

Summary:
First hour of playing this, I went from thinking this was the best simcade ever, to getting bored at the lack of purpose.
👍 I highly recommend this Sim/Simcade if you're planning to join or start an online private league.",1700447851,1700447851,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have had the game since day one, have all the DLC and I have tried repeatedly to get into this game

Firstly visually the game is stunning but once you get passed that sadly it is downhill. 
Unlike AMS1 the modding is completely restricted to liveries and driver names. 
If using a hweel and pedals get used to losing your keybinds and having to calibrate everything over and over. 
Like GT3's? Like Moza or the Nord? Then the online community is for you. The only online races with a decent amount of players is usually a GT3 at one of those two tracks. Pick any other car or track and you might as well just race AI. There is barely anyone on at the peak times
And then the cars, they are rough to drive. I have 100's of hours in iracing and other simes combined and the car feels like it is on ice, oversteering and spinning when you even breathe on the throttle. you can dial some of this out in the settings but it makes little difference.
Then there is the slow progress rate the game is being updated, throw out random DLC for cash is fine but when fundamentally it takes 4 years for them to admit they have an issue with tyre models and still dont properly fix it then I have an issue. Yes it has ovals but the AI is janky at the best of times. AN a day 1 promise was that we would get a career mode, 4 years later no career mode and not even a peak at it. 

Frankly this game feels like more of a cash grab than viable competition to the likes of AC or iracing. other than visuals this game has nothing else in my opinion",1699807906,1699807906,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It also inherits good things like easily creating multiplayer lobbies, the social stuff, the driver ratings, and the best-looking graphics (by far) given by the Madness Engine (It`s obviously the real Project CARS 3 with a Brazilian touch).

Yup. If you're looking for an approachable, immersive, fun, yet legit sim to get started with, buy this right now. If you like open wheeled cars, buy this right now. If you like motorsports history, buy this right now. If you don't want to fiddle with mods or subscriptions, buy this right now. If you like racing against AI, buy this right now. 

I've dabbled in casual sim racing on console in the past, this is a completely new kind of fun. Solid visuals and great optimization. AMS2 outperforms, F1, modded AC and vanilla ACC on my system. Considering I haven't tried every sim I can't say whether the FFB is good or bad, but AMS2 FFB has been the most enjoyable for me. 

racecraft.online is cool when you happen upon an actual race, and if you don't it's still plenty of fun to practice against AI with their car/track combos and track your driver rating. It's just a website and works seamlessly with AMS2 online, I don't understand how but it's sweet.

Important note: I play with a controller, not a wheel. I also mostly play offline races against AI. Thus, my opinion is based on that.

- Raceroom is better for single player. It's my go to racing sim for offline play. AI is just as good as AMS2 and it feels 10x better on a controller. You also have licensed championships (DTM, ADAC GT Masters, WTCR). Graphics are subpar though.
- Assetto Corsa has more realistic graphics (with mods), more tracks/cars (with mods), feels better on a controller and it's 10x cheaper. AI is poor though.
- Assetto Corsa Competizione also feels better on a controller, has better graphics, good AI and licensed GT Series (sprint and endurance). It is limited to GT3 cars though.

In sum, unless you wan't to play at obscure Brazilian tracks/race series, there are better alternatives. For online play go for iRacing or ACC. For offline play choose Raceroom, ACC (GT3 only) or Assetto Corsa (poor AI though).

My opinion may change once I buy a wheel. I also don't care about VR. Both things may be good for this game...I can't say.

Handles great even with a gamepad, wheel is recommended. Less cars than the other big titles but they do focus on very specific categories and recreate them very well. A mid-range GPU like an RTX4070 will let you play at 4K/max details and enjoy the scenery, effects, time of day changes. 

This is mostly for pros, without tutorials, but as long as you practice, practice, then practice some more, you will start to win. Or dial down the AI difficulty, and once you're ready at higher difficulty jump into multiplayer. Do download the demo first to get a feel for it.

After the Forza Motorsport 8 fiasco, I'm going back to this.

Developed by Reiza Studios, Automobilista 2 targets the hearts and minds of hardcore racing enthusiasts, promising an immersive driving experience. After spending considerable time on the tracks, it's clear that while it has certain shortcomings, its strengths are noteworthy and deserve a detailed examination.

From the get-go, Automobilista 2 offers striking visuals. The game leverages the Madness engine, previously used in Project Cars 2, and it does so with finesse. Lighting effects, track details, car models — everything is crisp and contributes to a high level of realism. Weather changes and time-of-day transitions are seamless and affect not only the aesthetics but also track dynamics, significantly impacting the way you need to handle your vehicle.

Where Automobilista 2 shines brightest is in its physics model. The cars feel weighty and respond to the tracks authentically. Tire temperatures, wear, grip - the game calculates all these factors in real-time, delivering an unrivaled realistic experience. It demands precision and skill, rewarding players who take the time to understand not only the tracks but also the intricate mechanics of the cars.

Automobilista 2 hosts an impressive array of vehicles and tracks. The selection of cars ranges from go-karts to classic formulas, GTs, and various prototypes. Brazilian racing series are well-represented, paying homage to the developer's roots. Track selection is equally rich, featuring well-known locations alongside lesser-known gems. However, while the quantity is laudable, the depth of the racing categories can sometimes feel lacking, particularly for those used to the extensive customizations available in other leading simulators.

The sound design in Automobilista 2 is a bit of a mixed bag. The engines roar with a satisfying growl, and the environmental audio cues help immerse players in the racing environment. However, inconsistencies in sound quality between different vehicles and occasional audio glitches can momentarily hamper the experience.

One area where Automobilista 2 currently falls short, especially in comparison to its predecessor, is modding. The first installment benefitted immensely from user-generated content, but this sequel restricts modding capabilities. It's a decision likely made to streamline the experience and maintain quality, but the trade-off comes at the expense of community engagement and game longevity.

Automobilista 2 is a worthy successor in a lineage of underdog racing sims. Its devotion to realistic physics and diverse content makes it a must-play for simulation enthusiasts. However, casual players may be intimidated by its complexity, and the lack of extensive modding support is a missed opportunity. If you're willing to invest the time to master its intricacies, Automobilista 2 offers an exhilarating, authentic, and rewarding virtual racing experience that few other games can match.",1694138506,1697759713,True,4,2,0.553825438022613525,0,True,False,False

Best ''Racing'' Sandbox since original rFactor.

Better than the experience you get with iRacing, Better graphics than PC2.  Puts rF2 to shame. Lacks the Assetto Corsa community and it's a shame because AMS2 is better to race & play. Well supported for Mods, Skins and Add-ons (Several Sites offer Free Mods, just Google to find).

Ultimately when it comes down to feel, it resides in the user. Some people think AMS2 is the best, others think iRacing, I personally believe Assetto Corsa. To me, the cars in this game suffer the same fault as they do in PC2, which is they're easier to drive at the limit. Don't get me wrong, that's not to say AMS2 is an easier game, but I feel like it's easier to recover from a mistake than compared to AC. Certain corners feel a little quicker than they do in AC, and cars can be forcibly corrected with power a bit more than AC.

That being said, that's what I love about AMS2. Specifically with open wheelers, and man, what a selection! I've been yearning for a classic Formula game, so it's great to see some of these come back to life. You can just toss these cars at a corner and strafe just over the limit with some dabble of gas! Also, it's great to see some representation of Brazilian Motorsports considering Reiza Studios is based in Brazil, not something common in the space. It's a more complete package than Assetto Corsa (UI, gamemodes, etc.), although the DLC is a bit of a whiplash considering the $40 price tag (no Spa, Monza, or Silverstone in the base game?!?! Especially since the total DLC cost is $400!).

Reiza is a small studio and they do a lot for their size but the Madness engine, while pretty graphically, seems to be a big project for them to develop, no pun intended.

The breadth of content is amazing, and while the DLC costs may stack up a bit, I think it's overall very good value given how much effort has been put into the historic versions of tracks, and how much a similar gamut of content would cost in something like iRacing. The base cost is still very low and will give you plenty to figure out if you want to spend more on the game further down the line. 
This is automatically the best game on the market for single seaters & F1 with a huge range of historic cars on offer which pretty much all feel amazing to drive in their own way.
For me, the only area that is a bit lacking is the multiplayer; the playerbase is a bit thin and the netcode can be a bit questionable at times. The former of those issues has been almost resolved by RaceCraftOnline (google it, its a really excellent 3rd party system for scheduled races), however the netcode is something that I hope will be worked on and get better over time.
However if a singleplayer racing SIM is mostly what youre looking for, AMS2 is basically perfect and I can't recommend it enough!",1693576336,1693576336,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am no pro sim racer but here's my honest review on Automobilista 2. I have tried so many sims from iRacing, ACC, RF2 and a few more. Honestly this is by far the best for the following reasons:

Great graphics:
Considering my pc isn't new and using a AMD Radeon RX 580 (pretty old) , 16gb of ram, i7 processor, its still graphically amazing. Even using the Oculus Quest 2 it handles pretty good!

Simplicity:
Just jump straight into an A.I race or straight into a multiplayer online game from the main menu. Its seriously easy and other games have had me jumping through hoops to get into a race which annoys the crap out of me!

Force Feedback:
I use the Logitech G290 wheel and its by far the absolute best for force feedback compared to how other racing sims have felt with this wheel. Not a top notch wheel but works so well with this sim.

Bottom Line:
Your pc doesnt need to be top notch to play this, the overall game play is smooth and headache free. Buy now and thank me later. Happy Racing All",1693414758,1693414758,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

Post-1.5: might even be better than rFactor 2. It's close. AI race so much better, and the AI mods and skinpacks available on racedepartment make it elite. I've set up offline seasons for myself. I'm enjoying everything from historic touring cars up to modern formula cars. The American open wheel stuff is the best representation of it ever in a sim. Even as a totally vanilla experience without modding, probably the best title you could ever start with for sim racing, pick up and play all the way to mastery can be found here.

The graphics run very well, and look better than anything that feels this good. The weather effects arent driveclub or gt7 level but they far surpass rf2. And the wet driving is as intuitive as it is challenging.

The only thing that AMS2 is lacking is quality online support. It works, that's about it. I'd be lying if I said I've tried much, but that's not what I use AMS2 for.

I was looking for next best Sim Racing Video Game, after watching various YouTube videos etc... I gave AMS2 a try.

So I felt like it's all good, yes the game has issues, but they're also working on these issues, so be patient and things will be better...

Until few updates were released and no issues were addressed, no major bug fixes, just as buggy as ever, some bugs I learned since the game official release three years ago, all we got in these updates was new tracks, cars. It became clear then what Reiza's approach is...

Fixing bugs doesn't generate profits, it will make existing game owners happier but you already have them on board so don't worry about them, most will stick around, instead let's focus on new content to attract those who have yet switched to AMS2, because that approach will generate profits.

So probably a lot of us had high hopes for this game, and we really felt like it's just a matter of time and things will be fine tuned, but it became clear in the last two updates that Bug Fixing is not Reiza's priority, not even close.

Don't ignore the circuits or cars you've never heard of - they can be a lot of fun.

I've been playing this on and off for a while but it never really felt right enough to keep me interested for long periods. I'd drive something, think ""it's neat that the game has this"" or ""wow this track/weather/time-of-day combo is really pretty"" and then realize I'd rather just be driving a different sim. I'm happy to see what it's grown into. All the cars finally feel like cars, and like they are actually touching the road. GT3/4s are planted; they'll oversteer or understeer when it actually makes sense instead of losing grip far too often and seemingly at random, as one example. The force feedback is quite good too. There's still plenty of room for improvement in the physics and tires and a definite gap from the fidelity of iRacing, paid rF2 content or ACC, but it's now either solidly a sim or really good at faking it.

It also retains from Project Cars 2 the multiplayer custom lobbies, and ability to very easily set up public or private rooms, invite some friends, fill the grid with AI (or not) and get going. A very underrated feature in sims.

Driving feels good, and VR makes it feel like you are sitting in the cockpit.  There are some little issues here and there with the camera placement in VR, but that could just as easily be my VR gear's problem. 

For single player gamers, I recommend checking out Everlasting Apex's Patreon to get the Procedural Career app. You'll have to grab a free download of the Second Monitor app as well, and there are occasional issues getting race results to autosort, but overall it is worth looking into.

1.5.0.5 review

The game is now a shallow casual motorsports experience... Fun if you like to do 10 lappers against cars with different physics than you even though you should be driving the same car... 

Doesn't matter if that's online or offline because some people get the super grip version of the Madness engine... Where they can drive over puddles on slicks like they've got some kind of Mario Kart power up... And mash the throttle with plenty of lock on exiting corners with over 1000nm of torque from the engine...

There's so many bugs that the driving experience has to be great and it's just not anymore, when racing this can be fun because so many people can just pick it up and be competitive but for a sim racing like me who enjoys long races against the AI or against other players it's just lacking...

You can't have a believable or fun experience with other cars on track without something going wrong... Green lights and drying lines happen at different times online, and there's so many other game braking issues like rogue set ups randomly loading on your car causing it to drive bad or sit at the limiter...

I once said that bugs didn't matter, hotlapping in this sim was worth the hoops to jump through...

But now I cannot recommend the experience...

1.4.-1.48 review (Now outdated, funny how game development works)

That said what Reiza have done is refine the physics to the point where it just works and feels right. There's some give in the tyre model so you can control the car if you know what little tickles in the FFB, sound or motion platform.

The feel is now at the point where most cars can be driven easily but pushing for those extra seconds or tenths requires the skill to do so. The live road really feels alive with marbles and the effects of the weather leaving treacherous puddles in places where you'd expect them on the tracks.

This is basically what the investors of pCARS 1&2 wanted. A beautiful looking sim that is actually a sim.

The missing features be damned, with EA most likely ruining Codemasters name over the coming few F1 games this is where I plan on doing my F1 racing... So many era's of F1 to choose from and with a skinning community that turns the bland default skins into their real life counterparts. You can race against Senna and Mansell or Stewart and Hill or so many other choices including 2022 F1 cars which are a complex beasts to drive.

The classical content doesn't stop with F1, Sportscars, GT racing and Brasil's own stock car series' are faithfully represented in the former glory.

Then there's Trucks, Karts and the fun kit cars that have been added. Plus all of the support content from the BTCC.

The road to F1 starts at Karts, goes through formula fords, F3 and it's your choice from there as  to how you get to your F1 championship. Sure it's not an actual game mode, but the option to do ""a road to"" is there for F1,. Touring cars and WEC.",1593612773,1692346647,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Paired with custom liveries and custom championships, it's just pure fun. The AI does a decent job on my current skill level, even though it is really blind sometimes. But that's not too bad in comparison to other ""real"" sims. 

As I mostly drive open wheelers, I can only say something about them when it comes to the simulation: They're amazing. I especially love the cars from the 80s and 90s. There's a fantastic mod for current gen F1 cars as well and honestly, I might never buy a Codemasters F1 game again. 

The game comes with lots of tracks, if you get the (pricey) DLCs, you have even more tracks and most importantly, more historic layouts. Standouts: Nordschleife, Spa, Hockenheim, Imola. There are also plenty of lesser known tracks from Brazil and Argentina which is really cool. 

It's quite astonishing how far this game has come. To turn PC2 into a fully fledged sim is the crowning achievement for Reiza. I hope there'll be even more tracks in the future, there are still so many missing which is the biggest downside of AMS2 in comparison to AC and rFactor2.",1692122739,1692122739,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My main issue with the game as of the 1.5 update is the poor AI, which even after three years of release, and many updates, is still bad enough for me to not recommend you buy this game. I will explain why I think AI is so important for this sim in particular, and what I think is wrong with it. 

There are a lot of reasons why different people want a racing game or racing sim to fulfil one sort of ""role"" or another so to speak, especially if they have a few different games. These reasons can be a bit subjective person to person, but I think if we look at the strengths and weaknesses of the game we can more or less objectively determine what MOST people will want from the game, and I think that MOST people want AMS2 to be their ""racing offline with AI"" sim. 
Even after the improvements of update 1.5. it is fair to say that most people do not consider AMS2 to be the pinnacle of sim racing physics. The physics in my opinion are not a strength of the sim, and are now  best described as adequate, in other words they are good enough, and only now with 1.5 consistently so, to not prevent me from enjoying what I want from the game. I do not think that this will be fulfilling the ""ultimate realism sim"" role for most people. 
The online multiplayer is also not a strength of the sim, because it is next to dead, which may be not really the developers fault, but it is what it is: the online multiplayer player base is certainly not active enough for the game to fulfil the ""online multiplayer game"" role for most people. 
The real strengths of AMS2 in my opinion are the incredible immersive qualities like weather, time of day, track evolution etc. along with just great graphics and sounds. The accessibility of the game is another strength. Some of these strengths do apply to just driving around without AI to be sure, but if you were looking to fulfil a ""hotlapping game"" or just ""driving game"" role, I think that most people tend to favour better physics and adequate immersion instead of the other way around. Where the incredible immersion really shines brightest is with a full grid of cars, doing some evening into night race with variable weather and having to figure out pit strategy and all of that. Some of the experiences I have had in this game are next to none in terms of racing immersion, It really can be special, and I think its really these immersive racing experiences that most people are after. That's why AI is so important for this game: there's better pure sim hot lap games and better online games, and since you NEED racing opponents for racing immersion, it becomes absolutely important that the AI opponents aren't awful. 

The AI is awful though, at least most of the time. If you look at the forums there are lots of people complaining about two main problems, and most of them can explain it better than me but ill try. Firstly, the opponents are not at all consistent in difficulty, and this isn't remedied by just making them harder or easier track to track, because its not consistent through the lap itself. I mean that they are sometimes impossibly fast on straights, and then just park on apex of corners. Sometimes its the opposite, they seem to have impossible grip through rain, or around some corners. There's some sort of rubber banding effect where the game tries to correct for AI that's slow in spots by just cheating essentially, so you are running into the back of them through corners and then on straights they pass you back up. This is not drafting or different gearing or something, its mario kart level rubber banding. If you want to confirm this, try using one of the slower cars that have a limited top speed by gear ratios etc., the AI will not draft by you, they will approach with a 30 kmph advantage like they have magic DRS and fly by you even if you are doing top speed. It can be completely immersion breaking to be slamming into a car thats parked at the apex of an open throttle corner, only then to be totally helpless out of the gate of the next corner that heads into a straightaway. This alone is my biggest problem becuase the AI becomes moving barriers instead of racing opponents, even if you have similar lap times at the end of the day you aren't really racing them its just no fun. The other main problem that people mention is AI agression, it seems that the AI can't go a full length race without just torpedoing you at some point, and setting the aggression scale to low in my opinion often results in AI that is weirdly unwilling to pass you for the duration of the part of the race that you get to have until one of them torpedoes you anyways.  People will point to certain combinations that they say do work for racing with the AI, but having to go looking for quality within the huge quantity is disappointing to me, and I often find myself trying to make a car track combo work and being frustrated. 

To conclude this is a game that is SO CLOSE to delivering what the people want, and It just baffles me, as it has others, that the devs are pumping out more more more content with these updates, instead of working on the quality of the AI. They have been adding to the immersion and accessibility over the development to be fair, but what are all of the new tracks and cars really worth if the AI wont let me finish a race?  I hope that the AI is the number one focus now for the devs, because even if they brought it to adequate, as they did the physics, that's the last puzzle piece and the game will be a true gem. If they are successful, its hard to imagine what the legacy of a game that took 3 years to be good might be into the future, but I will still be happy.",1691915537,1691915537,False,4,0,0.498562991619110107,0,True,False,False

--- Update 2023-08-12
------------------------------

I still like it, but it suffers from Windows ""Crackling sound"" issue more than other titles. PC 2 and Dirt Rally 2.0 don't have it, ACC only in transitions of replay, RF 2 has it massively.
But after a loooooooooot of research, the root of this issue seems to be Windows...

Ok despite that, RX is fun and extremely good physics wise, but lacks in content and the AI is bad. Really bad.
But I guess, for hot-lapping RX is really nice. I nearly solely do dirt racing, so Rally or Rallycross.

Another thing that is reaaally annoying and currently a gamebreaker for me is the dirt sound. It is a stacked composition of one single dirt sound and sounds terrible. This needs to be addressed. It sounds like 20 instances of the same sound sample are spammed over each other. For 19€...this is a no go.

I guess I'll give it a try sometime soon again, when AI and the Dirt sound issue are fixed or I can't stand PC 2 anymore, since hot lapping was disabled a while ago due to EA take over. Thanks EA..Ok and then, there is Dirt Rally 2.0, but I know it inside out already :-D

Currently my recommendation: Do not buy the Adrenaline Pack PT1 until AI and the dirt sound issue are addressed. The sound crackling seems to be something some Windows users have to live with.

--- Original review:
---------------------------

It is definitely neither perfect, nor complete. But it is fun. I do like it overall more than other sims (despite Dirt..which is my favorite), because...

* Completely controllable with the wheel
* The UI is simple
* Nordschleife, Spa + Historicals
* Fun (though not 100% accurate simulated)
* The upcoming weather system (prediction for past 40 years including foliage change)

I am a casual sim racer, powering on sims (Dirt and AMS 2) like 2-3 times a week for about 30 minutes per session. Just hot lapping my favorite tracks. That's just it. For this kind of racers, it is just perfect :-)",1622713654,1691912896,False,0,0,0.505141377449035645,0,True,False,False

Pros:
I love the variety of tracks and car types.  You just won't get this much variety in any other sim.

The graphics and performance are as good as you can get on any sim.

Negatives:
The menu system and setup screens, well, basically the entire user interface is clunky and is in desperate need of a make-over.

I couldn't get my Occulus Quest 2 working very well.  It works. But has a lot of framerate issues and graphical anomalies.  However, I didn't spend really any time trying to tweak it in (I like things to just work).  I know the Quest 2 isn't exactly what you'd call a high end VR headset.  But it works very good in iRacing.  Either way, I know doing good quality VR is possible in AMS2.  There are tons of videos online.  I just don't know what all is involved in getting it like that.  Just something to consider if you are a VR user.

A huge range of cars and some of the best Formula cars in sim games with more being added all the time.

A warning for those of you considering buying the DLC, if you buy parts individually they don't get removed from the full price of the season pass, so if you buy a couple and then later decide to try and buy the full season pass, you will be spending more.

The one thing that strikes me the most from Automobilista 2, (AMS2) is that it just works. You can choose from many different motor sporting categories. Different racing periods. Select many different tracks. Select what time of day or night. Timed or lapped race. Rain or dry. Pit-stop rules for tyre changes or compulsory stops. Multi-class racing. Put all of that together, and it just works! 

Of the other tiles out there, yes they are good when modded, or may cost a significant amount to continually own. Now I have nothing against mods as they do enhance a stock simulator. But, when using mods, it can take time and effort for you to setup a mod just the way to want it. Many times in other modded titles, I've had racing disappointment where something goes wrong or the mod crashes. 

All of AMS2 content just works. Or course Reiza has face some challenges with bug issues, however what game or simulator doesn't have them? At least Reiza is always there, doing everything they can to ensure that AMS2 will be a quality product. Proof of this again is evident with the release of V1.5 which helps towards fixing some of the issues associated with tyres. 

Adding to this, Reiza still continues to release quality DLCs, bringing more and more to this simulator. Yes, we are now seeing mods for AMS2, but with the content Reiza has already provided, I'm not compelled to introduce 3rd party products which may interfere with a top quality sim that just works!

While I only have the base game, I'd say the amount of content here is quite good and offers a good variety of racing disciplines for the majority of enthusiasts as well as offering the type of content no other sim seems to be able to supply without relying on the community and mods.

If you're interested in Sim Racing, I would highly recommend Automobalista 2 (AMS2). It has a Demo (free of course!) and the base game is $45 (CAD) and offers a solid sim, though the DLC *feels* a little on the expensive side.

  There are some negatives though, but the only one I want to address is the A.I., which is worse than Assetto Corsa (incl. Content Manager + Custom Shaders Patch), which is currently my baseline for A.I. From what I've seen, the A.I. are fairly oblivious to the player, especially if you ""only"" have a 1/3rd of your car alongside during the braking zone and into the apex as they tend to just push you off the track,

  The A.I. don't seem to know how to deal with passing a slower class in Multi-Class racing, which is disappointing since it's so easy to setup a multi-class race. They seem to just not accelerate out of corners if the higher class is alongside the lower class, even when there's a huge performance gap. Next; the A.I. is very slow, primarily in high-commitment corners like T1 at Adelaide and a lot of corners at Imola, which is VERY exploitable,

Even after all that, I would still recommend AMS2 to anyone who's interested in Sim Racing.

All aspects of driving are great, there's a lot of different cars and tracks to choose from including some niche Brazilian tracks to get the break from usual track featured literally everywhere else. It also features the best VR experience right now for me, especially performance-wise.

However, this is all let down due to some minor bugs that you simply cannot miss. Cameras, placeholders, driver models clipping through the seat. Nothing is a deal breaker, but overall very annoying and taking away the joy from what should be a fun experience.

If you treat that as a final beta or late early access - it'd be something to ignore, however we're talking here about official release, so it cannot be dismissed anymore. Luckily Reiza have a good record of looking after their games after being released, so I'm sure eventually those things will get polished out, but as of 1.0.0.3 it needs pointing out. Still a good driving title nonetheless.

------ EDIT ------
Since my review was from a while ago and Reiza updated the game many times (v1.1.1.1) since it's time to provide some update on my review to reflect it.

Handling model was vastly improved, perhaps not 100% there yet, but clearly heading in the right direction. FFB is pretty good - other titles seems bland and tasteless after experiencing AMS2. Every time it brings the joy and happiness when playing. AI is also massively improved and fun to race against. 

With 2-3 cars and one track per month and development schedule targeting fixes and improvements it's clearly on the rise. Definitely worth having now and no longer a toxic love.

--- 1.3 Update ---
From a difficult love to a proper butterflies in my belly :D

It was a journey for sure, still unpolished in some places but wow - it feels amazing now. FFB is top notch, graphics are still great and content is growing and growing. Ranking system is up and there's little to not like AMS2. 

--- 1.5 Update ---
Well, while some things still have minor rough patches here and there, but oh my - the car feeling is just delicious. It feels meaty, cars are as predictable as can be. AI is fun, plenty of customisation options and even mods are there if somehow content from the game is not enough.

I love it, even if it lacks compared to Project Cars 2, which happens to be my favorite racing game prior to this, but I'm sure there will be a lot of content updates ahead of us!

Edit: So... Last I checked, there were not many DLCs. Now all the good tracks in my book are behind a pay wall. I'm not paying extra for tracks that Project Cars 2 has for free! 

This is one thing I hate nowadays about games, but yeah, I'm changing my rating from recommended to not, just because the DLCs are almost 10€ each.

Visually it's what future Sims will look like.  So I can't not recommend it. And some drivers love tail happy handling. Anyway below is what I originally posted and still think is fair comment, though it has continued to improve. 
I don't like to give a thumbs down and would prefer a thumbs neutral. There are some good points to this sim. It looks great, is properly optimised for VR and has a lot of variety and things you don't get in normal sims.
However, for me, I just can't get used to the lack of feeling between me the car and the track surface [edit - I found this can be improved a bit by moving the in car seat around, in particular, moving it forward. Though it may be a VR thing.]. Nor the completely over the top tail happy nature of most of the cars. On some cars, 1st and 2nd gear are a waste of time unless you enjoy spinning instantly  [edit - this has improved a lot.].
Now they do keep improving the physics, and you could spend time tweaking the force feedback and car set-up (I do), and maybe I'm just a really terrible driver; but I find the sim just too much hassle to be able to find a car/track/set-up combination that is enjoyable to drive  [edit - again this has got better]. I have other sims that I can jump into and get a feel for the car much quicker. My favourite is RF2, so that might help you understand my driving preferences.
So I'm giving up on this for now. I'll keep coming back in the hope it, or me, click and it becomes enjoyable but I've run out of patience for now.",1655562613,1688115507,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After looking closer and then searching my AMS2 game after launching I realized things were not right. So I ditched the MODs and uninstalled AMS2, to then reinstall it clean and see what loads.  And viola! it all loaded.  I decided I wanted to just take AMS2 for a test drive after reading and watching the vids from Reiza.  I was skeptical thinking it would be the same ole thing, car feeling like I'm driving with rain tyres or literally on oil on the road again.  So I took it for a test drive.   First I drove some GT3 and it was quite nice.  Seems like a bit of improvement.   I then test drove the Gen 1 ,2 & 3 USA 1995 and 98 Indy rides.
I was pretty blown away at the sims performance!   There is a difference. It didn't used to drive like this!   In the past there have been some improvements, but this is quite noticeable.  Then I took their new as they say fictional Indy for a test drive.   Now I might not really be too keen with the clear canopy with no halo...... and I might not like the thought of an actual fictional ordeal, ...and I might not be so delighted about it's overall design.  Now it doesn't look bad, but it looks ... well... pretty good.   So I took it for a ride.  And I was blown away!   I couldn't believe it!  The way the transmission revs and timing, RPM?! The fact I can hit the gas quick enough at a moments notice and it i'll rip the rear end out from under me, or if I do it right it i'll just fish tail a tad coming out from a hairpin turn to accelerate fast away from the other cars?!  I can literally feel everything!!  What fun!  Now I've always complained and told Reiza my 2 cents once that I felt that if they couldn't make a Dallara car then just make something and we can call it our own. 
Now I would have honestly liked a more Dallara looking ride , yes.... but...... However, The way it handles, the way it feels, the way the tyres feel the road, the way it revs!,  by far supersedes liveries, real driver names, and exact model.  What's the point of having an exact model if it doesn't drive like this!?   I have the Dallara IR18 iracing ride, I have rFacotor 2, I do like and respect KAOS's IR18 ride.   But I am really blown away by this.  
I really like Project Cars 2's DW-12 Indy.   ACC's new 1.9 update!   And now AMS2?!!   With all the contract issues and how they were unable to deliver us a IR18, they still came through in my opinion after driving this!  And not just in this car either but the whole sim to a point.  However though, this car has a feel like no other from my seat.  I'm using a Fanatec CS V2.5 rim, V3 Pedals with a GT-DD Pro wheel base.  TrackIRv5.

Drifting simulator...

The devs seem to think that anything other than an open wheeler can't 'Turn' around corners without sliding the ar3e end out everywhere, there's ZERO realism compared to real life when it comes to throttle/input torque, especially at slower speeds. 

High RPM? Over maximum torque output? Doesn't matter, it'll still spin the wheels like it has the torque of a planet, and tyres made of plastic.
Absolute crap.
But what would I know...

--------------------

[h1]EDIT: 8 Nov 2022[/h1]
Just had another go...

Caterham Academy: If anybody (Inc the developers) think a Caterham Academy (And most other RWD) will spin up a wheel while doing 60mph in 3rd gear when cornering then this 'Simulator' is never going to be anywhere near 'Realistic'. 

It's an absolute joke to think that people consider it anything like real life.

Have the developers or anybody who praises this 'Sim' ever driven a race prepared car with and without a slippy diff? You don't automatically spin up a wheel everywhere, at any speed, in any gear without a slippy diff FFS. It's like there's just zero consideration for the torque output VS RPM VS speed with no bogging down at all. 

The cars drive like they have the torque of a universe and a lot of people would get a shock if they drove the real life variants. 

This is one (Major) area where iRenting blows this 'Sim' out of the water.

It 'may' be worth still considering...namely because near EVERY update supposedly improves on physics with tyre/physics revisions, while somehow still having previously been lorded as being 'great'.
People need to stop accepting what 'great' is, make their minds up, speak their minds or...speak only from real life experience.

--------------------

[h1]Edit: 7th Jan 2023[/h1]
Revisiting after recent updates. Still crap.
Not just the MASSIVE amount of bugs, many of which have been there from day one (Three years ago at this point!)

But it's the physics...the physics are just so badly wrong. And I'm near convinced at this point that the actual tracks are playing a part in altering the 'Base' physics of cars, I do not mean handling/setup, that's very different. 

Don't get me started on the setups side though, especially the differentials. My God. Everything in the setups is WAY over exaggerated, in fact most of the default setups are without question driving more like a drift car setup. 

But you have to ignore the differential numbers in-game (Ramp angles AND preloads) those are realistic numbers, but they don't act anything like they would in real life. That's the problem.

To get anything like a base realism you have to loosen the locking of the diffs up far too much (High angles for less locking, low preload for lesser instantaneous and somewhat sustained effect), it makes most cars act more like you'd expect, but then the completely over the top spinning of a single wheel I mentioned earlier in the review catches you out, because no matter how much you feather the throttle...the torque maps are all absolute crap. AMS2 LOVES spinning wheels.

Please...
Take the McLaren MP4/6 around Imola 78. See how great it feels on throttle.
Now try it at Azure or Adelaide (There are others), is it suddenly spinning when you just look at the throttle pedal? And I mean similar speeds, similar corners, any speed.

Like you literally just tickle it and SPIN. And it can BE at any speed. THIRTY MPH and the car will pirouette full 180 like you've just stamped the throttle down and held it there for 1-2 seconds, and it keeps spinning/sliding for far too long after backing off throttle.


A race tyre does not act like this FFS. Even in the pits setting off or purposefully doing donuts, it's as though the track selection makes it feel like a different game.

And this is the problem with AMS2, the inconsistency. At some tracks, the physics (Base) feel 'OK', at other tracks they are far from OK, even having what I call 'Autobin' corners where there is an 'effect' baked into a corner no matter what you do. You can actually feel them. The car and its physics should react to the track, NOT the other way around.

--------------------

[h1]Edit: 9th Jan 2023[/h1]
Trying to run A.I races. Infuriating beyond belief.

First of all. Setting off, if you get any sign of wheel spin...You're done for, you may let off throttle thinking feather the spin off...But no. 

AMS2 keeps spinning the wheels. It's just an absolute joke. All the clowns blindly praising this in it's current form on the Reiza forums need to get in a race prepared car, or TBH ANY car for that matter...
It absolutely baffles me how people are accepting this as anything like realistic.

--------------------
[h1]Edit: 9th April 2023[/h1]

Still horrendously unrealistic slow speed physics and throttle input/torque mapping. 

Completely unrealistic. If you seriously think a Chevy Opala has that sort of torque input through third gear at 2-3k rpm OR (Importantly 6kRPM) then you're living in fantasy land.

There's ZERO bogging down/torque build up OR lack of torque through being over peak torque drop off. The telemetry even shows laughable torque stats. It will spin wheels in 3rd at 30mph, it will spin wheels in 3rd at 70mph. Modulating throttle or not.

There is ZERO ability to modulate the throttle, you can simply plant your foot and you'll hit 30mph in 1st, 50mph in 2nd..3rd etc all while spinning the wheels. 

Try and modulate the throttle to let the tyres incrementally grip up and what happens? The wheels will still spin like it has the torque of a planet and tyres made of plastic, while the ridiculous A.I pull away like jets, and you end up being much, much slower.

Surely anybody who's done any form of racing, or generally knows how to drive properly sees that this is completely unrealistic. This 'game' is just too little, too late. 

The so called 'Long term commitment' has just meant constant...and tiring updates to the physics and tyre models while throwing in content to keep the 'Gamers' happy. It's the most infuriating 'Sim' I've ever encountered.

At least with PC2, you knew what you got and it stayed that way. Some cars were great, some were terrible and that was that. AMS2 is just a constant mash of changes and yet it's still a million miles away from anything realistic.

It will need to be dialled in properly to get the most out of it, but it is very well worth doing as this is definitely a contender to be one of the best sim racing games available in terms of immersion and quality of game development.

I give it a thumbs down because the vr headset movement tracking for this game ruins immersion by using head movement to increase/decrease volume of the left/right channels when you move your head when using a VR headset. This may work when your default audio device is the actual vr headset, but it does not work when your default audio output is an external amplifier or surround sound speaker system. There seems to be no way of stopping the head movements from interfering with my surround sound setup.

TLDR below.

Get it on sale!

Def not worth full price. Don't get me wrong it's a decent racing sim. However coming from Assetto Corsa and Assetto Corsa Competizione (hereafter AC and ACC) and jumping back and forth between the 3 games I can categorically say that claims of this game having the greatest graphics or performance are sadly overstated. The best graphics is ACC, I give 10/10 running at 120hz capped solid ultra everything (upscaled from 1440p to 4K) on my system (monitor can run 165hz but my GPU is air cooled so I don't want fans at max all the time hence 120fps cap). Next is AC I give 9/10 (note: using content manager with CSP and Sol 2.1 fakeHDR) again 120fps solid. AMS2 is actually only almost as good as AC and I give 8/10, also max everything at 120fps. Good example is Nurburgring (Nordschliefe) where on AMS2 it is a bit blurry from DOF post processing but on AC it is sharp and clear and gorgeous (even if simulated)HDR. Also both AC and ACC sport much more detailed models for cars and tracks, and while AMS2 isn't devoid of trackside objects it just doesn't match up.
Content wise AMS2 is a bit lacking also with regard to vehicles not so much tracks, even tho I got season pass there are still many categories with only 1 vehicle in them (e.g. V8's where there is just a cheverolet and no other V8's! wtf?). ACC has almost as many cars and it is dedicated to GT3/4, AC even without mods has just got more but the fact you can add practically any car/track you like and generally for free kinda makes it the king still.
As for FFB it's comparable across all 3 titles, any differences are minor. Can't say I enjoyed driving any one more or less than the other.
I haven't tried multiplayer so can't comment on any difference there.

TLDR:
In Summary AMS2 is a solid sim that brings a few different tracks and genres of cars to the table, and if you are not savvy enough to take the time to set up content manager with CSP and SOL for AC then it brings a level of graphics comparable to AC without any setup hassles.
All in all however it is not worth the full price.",1590872441,1685184034,True,0,0,0.44214281439781189,0,True,False,True

Bought this game years ago, but never played it much and never gelled with it. It was very undercooked when it came out. 2+ years later, it's starting to really become a very nice sim. I have more fun in here than I do in iRacing, because that, I feel, is AMS2's strength--it puts the fun back into sim racing. I used to think that I disliked road racing...turns out, I like road racing in AMS2. I DON'T care for iRacing road tracks because the penalties are so punitive. Even spinning out when you don't touch anyone else is already 2x. Make a little too hard of contact with another racer (even if he hits you, and even if you both are able to continue on the racing line)? 4 more incident points. Before you know it, you are racing for safety rating, avoiding certain track/car combinations due to fear of losing SR, etc, and a guy feels up tight. 

AMS2 solves this problem. Sure, you can turn on track cutting penalties and all that, but it's not so rigid like iRacing. The premise of iRacing is that you will have a lot cleaner races since they have iRating and SR in place. While that CAN be true sometimes, I often find that there are still a good amount of races where it doesn't seem to help much, ESPECIALLY in the lower class road racing. There is a lot of chaos and carnage.

Anyway, I feel like AMS2 is getting better and better and it's made more a lot more adventurous since I'm free from safety rating constraints (but obviously I race clean because that's who I am).

Pros:
[list]
    [*]It has good AI compared to other sims playable offline. They are fighting back and do not bump you to crash like in Assetto Corsa Competizione. They do mistakes while racing against to you. Sometimes they crash and cause safety car. 
    [*]Content variety is amazing devs are updating the game frequently and new adding content.
    [*]Amazing VR implementation with this beautiful graphics. I actively playing it on VR and AMS2 has the best VR implementation on the market (even better than iRacing imo)

Cons:
[list]
    [*]Spray effect on rain is not that good. And mostly feels like it is traction loss only. After experiencing the rain on ACC (with puddle physics etc), AMS2 feel a bit less complete at racing on wet.
    [*]It would be perfect to have a decent career mode. It is just creating a championship and racing in a schedule at the moment. It would be great to start from f.e karting and climb to the F1.

Cost friendly compared to other titles in the genre, formidable AI (would love to see in depth AI customization akin to iracing) that fights you convincingly. Multiplayer works well enough but would love to see expanded functionality such as online championships and admin privileges (restart race, full course yellow trigger). Forcefeedback meets all expectations, with plenty of detail. Game looks gorgeous, best in class performance and graphics. UI gets the job done but serves little beyond that. 

Would like to see expanded accessibility options for players on non traditional hardware, including controllers. Settings are detailed but overwhelming and can be difficult to know how to dial in.

Simulation and tyre model are acceptable. As my goto for ""hop in and race"", the tyre model is convincing enough (for GT3's) but if you're coming from iracing you will have to suspend your belief as you save slides and survive missed braking points at times. If you are pursuing something more punishing, I would suggest taking a look at rfactor.

The main downside is that, even if it's good as I just said, it's believable and they fight yourself and each other pretty realistically, while also making mistakes sometimes, the AI is very inconsistent between car and track combos. You might set the AI difficulty at 90 in one race and have the opponents be competitive, while in the next one with the same cars you will obliterate them at the same difficulty level. You might have to spend hours practicing to find the best difficulty level for that specific track, and that's obviously annoying.
In certain parts of the track they also seem faster than they should normally be, while in others they are slower than you.

If they fix the AI inconsistencies and create a good career mode or system then there's no denying it's the best single player racing sim currently out there.",1682875135,1682875319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Very high praise indeed from me, because in my opinion nothing else has ever come close to the PCars 1 and 2 games for a truly superb racing experience (do not mention PCars 3 to me at all).

In comparison to PCars2 this game has dynamic real weather, developing track dynamics, new cars and tracks, new custom Championship mode, better wet tracks, better sounds, more advanced car handling and tyre simulation, and much improved AI driving. It retains the high standard of graphics that I loved from Project Cars 1 and 2 whilst removing the lethal puddles from PCars2 so wet tracks are great fun in this game. The only thing this game doesn't have is PCars' careers.

No longer just South American tracks either, this games features all the UK tracks in PCars and several others besides such as Spielberg. Some superb laser scanned European tracks are now available for purchase separately, and the game is presently nicely expanding into the USA as well with it's Racing USA expansion packs - which will include oval racing in future packs - hopefully also proper Nascar racing with associated stages, drafting mechanics, and rules.

The new Custom Championship mode is still in beta but when this is finished it will add an enormous amount of fun to the game, I've been waiting for one of these in a racing game for years. The fact you can pick your own races and rules and race against a set of drivers in several tied races sounds great. If they get this sorted I won't miss PCars' careers at all.

So glad to be able to play the UK PCars tracks and cars like Oulton Park, Snetterton, Donnington with the two Ginettas but with better lighting, weather, sounds and, most importantly, against a better rival AI. No more massive slowing down on Donnington's first corner, the AI in this game defend their positions and race well, and they don't keep hitting you from behind either!

In terms of improvements - I would love to be able to active pause the game so I can change pitstop strategy mid-race. I would love to see a save facility mid-race and mid-weekend session for full real time endurance races and to be able to leave and pick up race weekends. I would like a Clio Cup car added along with a couple of Ferraris and Lamborghinis. I would love to see some proper Le Mans Prototype cars added (there are similar cars in the game already) along with the Le Mans track. I would love to see Croft Circuit, Zandvoort, Fuji and Sugo tracks added. And please can we have less bumpy external views for the openwheel cars.

Issue - the main issue with this game is the AI. Although it is good in some respects in that it soemtimes acts human, makes mistakes, some drivers are better than others etc, it is also very predictable in that you can take over AI cars on the same corner of the track as they are always predictably slow on one or two corners. This makes the game a matter of waiting behind the AI then overtaking on that same corner every time. That ruins the experience of the game quite a bit after a while. And it happens with every car on every track.

Graphics advice - MSAA set on high is far faster for me than FXAA or SMAA + Supersampling, whilst looking of the same quality. Otherwise I have everything set on high except grass and shadows (medium). I am getting 50-60fps in the rain at night (100fps+ during day + dry) on a Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, GTX1060 card which I think is very reasonable and certainly it feels very smooth.",1623598428,1682162490,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I hope this sim gets the issues sorted out over the next few months as i feel this could become one of my top sims. Fingers Crossed. so far 7/10 since the patch, this sim has plenty of potential .

Still Ai needs work after second patch!  also brakes are still a issue in my eyes! Hitting the barriers at Monaco slow down feeling not great !  have told them on their forum so hopefully they will get this done. Still cant improve the review score yet

Graphics: 8/10, It's a very good looking Sim, I would say the only better looking sim would be Assetto Corsa Competizione.

VR Performance: 9/10, On my system, RTX3070 with Pico 4 it's the best performing VR sim experience I've had.

Multiplayer 8/10, with a group of people you know it can be hugely fun.

Realism 8/10, use custom force feedback files from race department makes a huge difference to the feel of the cars.

AI 6/10, This really needs work, some classes and tracks are great, others the AI are brain dead, be sure to play around with AI skill and aggression for each class of car and track.

Content 8/10, It has a wide selection of free content and all of the DLC is AAA quality, especially if you can get it when its discounted.

Single player 7/10, it has custom championships, time trials and single races, hopefully in the future Reiza will add a career mode, For now you can use and external app called racing life (on race department) to simulate a career.",1679871754,1679871754,True,1,0,0.534883737564086914,0,True,False,False

Problems are as follows

updates come out at random intervals, when they used to be monthly or bi monthly

game physics once where great, and the game had a great tire model, Reiza has gone and backpedaled all of that, and made the cars un driveable.

The Season Pass that many of us bought has yet to be completed, and it was supposed to be complete by the start of this year

The forums are full of brown nosers, and the only opinion you are allowed to have is that of said brown noser, if you have a differing opinion, then you get banned.

the only cars being added are open wheel, F1/ Indy type cars, so there isn't any fresh series represented.

the multiplayer, which used to be excellent, has slipped downhill fast, so you can't really have a good race anymore.

all new DLC releases come half baked, when they used to be complete, I mean, really, all new DLC is broken, and needs hotfixes just to be useable.

Admittedly I let this sit on my hard drive for over a year because I was so disappointed with the game at launch, even though I bought the full game/season pass. I loved AMS1, so my hopes were very high with this game. AMS2 had some of the same flaws as project cars with multiple vehicles having flawed physics at launch. It seems to be fixed now; however, this game still has some pretty wonky car setups as default, with almost all cars having positive toe out in the front. That causes cars to be very reactive just off center and causes some cars to wander. This could be very off putting for people who don't get into car setup or know why a car may be behaving a certain way. My first step in almost all vehicles is to remove this toe out. This game does a good job of relaying what the car and tires are doing and slides are a little easier to catch. I think this is actually a good thing because slides are often easier to catch in the real world with all the proprioceptive feedback you as a driver get from the momentum change as the slide is caught and being able to time your recovery steering and unwinding the wheel. Other games struggle to relay this properly and you end up pendulum swinging right off the course.

The game is gorgeous and I can run it pretty consistently at 60FPS on a midtier 2014 gaming PC (in 2023). Can't say that about pretty much any other racing game, and this includes weather effects. I don't know how they pull this off. Physics feel good, force feedback is a good mix of bumps/suspension feel, canned effects and tire feel. Probably only second to Assetto Corsa. I love the variety of cars in the game, although they've added tons of open wheel cars which for me is less interesting. Although, the vintage formula cars are all very cool and they behave like I'd expect, and prefer to be driven partially sliding through corners. Jumping into those cars I feel like I've teleported back to playing Grand Prix Legends. Not many sims get these cars right but Reiza has. Still, I much prefer the quirky assortment of touring cars. They have tons to choose from although I wouldn't mind a few rosters being fleshed out more (like the DTM class). I wish they'd bring in some of the older brazilian stock cars from the early 2000's which they had licensing agreements for in AMS1 and Game Stock Car. The track list is one of the best out there. One of the best parts about the track list is all the south american tracks not typically featured in US/Japanese/European racing titles.

I have mainly used iRacing for sim racing for 8 years now and wanted something I could play and not take so seriously. This sim isn't terrible, but I'm also not that impressed. I don't think it's worth full price. It has a more arcadey feel than Assetto Corsa and cars do feel too bouncy. The oversteer while using throttle feels over-exaggerated and cars are not as stable as they should be. Cars feel a little wild exiting corners and going onto straightaways. They should hook up and gain traction faster when applying less throttle. The car steps out a lot in places it shouldn't. The GT3 cars feel a little sloppy and just don't have the grip you'd expect. Understeer exiting corners feels generic, and feels like it's just punishing you for using throttle exiting a corner with no real reason. I did a lap with the Mercedes GT3 car on both here and iRacing in Austria and the difference was big, iRacing was far more predictable. Same conditions, weather, time, date and setups. I also noticed going over elevation changes was a brutal experience and often threw the car for a loop. You should feel the car fight back, but not completely break loose and fly off the track. It induces a strange amount of unnatural oversteer immediately. This was with warm brakes and tires as well. I had the most fun with the slower cars in the game. Karts are a cool addition and the game even has kart tracks. I had a blast racing AI in the rental karts, and they're a challenge to master. I also loved the base content cars, it included a lot of favorites such as the Mercedes C9, German touring cars, Formula Vee, and tons of open wheels. The graphics are pretty aesthetically pleasing and the game runs and looks smooth. AI puts up a decent fight and hasn't made any stupid moves on me yet. They do wreck together sometimes which adds a surprise and fun factor to your races. There is also a mechanical randomization feature that can cause you to have car issues during the race. Force feedback is peppy and the cars will tell you if they're getting sassy. Bumps and curbs are translated well to the wheel. Online racing seemed consistent, with fast servers and lots of people online. Overall I had fun playing it, and if you're looking for a sim to start on without having to break the bank, this may be a good choice for some. I would recommend Race Room over this game at its current state because of their similarities, and if you want a great GT3 experience, buy ACC.

It's easy to make the races easy or hard depending on who you are racing with. It's set up quite a bit like Project Cars 2, which makes perfect sense, since it shares the same game engine tech, but it's much improved. There are leagues with the discords, and the community is typically pretty good on race etiquette. I suspect that this is due to the general difficulty of a true sim racing game. There are assists, but you got to be pretty good on controller to hang here, so it takes a lot of patience to drive the grip and weight on this game. Very similar IMO<<< to Assetto Corsa Competizione.  iRacing, or any other would be realistic track racers. The major upside here over both those game, lots more choices in cars and tracks for your dollar as compared to iRacing, and ACC. But a very similar feel in how the car weight and tires cycles really matter in managing dynamic track conditions. and these folks keep tweaking and updating all the time. I believe they really care.

FFB is okay on my G27, the forces can sometimes be too strong or too weak imo but I might need to play with the settings more. Something like GR.5 that was in PC2 would be a nice addition and some of the other classes could use getting more cars and livery slots.

I feel there is a great sense of connection to the ground games like ACC don't get across, the tyres in AMS 2 feel like rubber, they feel like they are pliant and if you hit a curb when you return to the tarmac the tyres compress followed by the suspension and i just don't get that from ACC where the tyres feel very hard with no compression.

This game also has options, you can set up races in any way you want and the AI are competent if you want to go single player, the online structure struggles compared to many games though and i think the playerbase leans towards single player/hotlapping resulting in not many live servers packed with many players which is a shame.

i have had some bugs and issues resulting in some problems, i have had a couple of instances where racing online the game will freeze for a solid couple of seconds resulting in my crashing into a wall as it unfreezes, had this at least 4 times. no issue here with my pc (5800x 3d, RTX4090, 32gb ram). This is a serious issue and i don't know why it happens but only ever on this game, rare but annoying. My other issue being at time i feel like cars lack polish, maybe there will be dials not working or mirrors not reflecting and silly issues like that but as time has gone by Reiza have clearly improved and gone from strength to strength, the latest cars released are excellent models with the details working and looking as they should.

I really think this game does not get the love it deserves for a multitude of reasons, but if you love racing i dont think you can go wrong, looks fantastic (probably the best racer visually), drives pretty damn fantastic (wouldn't have said this 6 months ago), sounds fantastic, especially exterior (interiors too quiet, need some of that pop and bang inside, too muted). definitely can recommend today.",1672534197,1672534197,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Key reasons for me to consider this purchase :

1. This is something that many modern games lack which is the ability to host lobbies and play with your friends with little effort (and also has LAN support). This ensures longevity of the game beyond its development lifecycle
2. Well optimized to run on any supported system from 3-4 years back atleast
3. Maintains the same formula from AMS 1 with variety of vehicles and tracks but with additional features like weather, time and more.
4. Mod support is present albeit less than juggernauts like AC but the devs are committed to bring decent mod support in this game (Mentioned in December Dev Blog)
5. The game looks breathtaking for taking snaps if you are a fan of taking cinematic screenshots

Constant updates with improvements, bug fixes and new cars and tracks. Each DLC pack is well worth the asking price and offers tons of fun for hours on end. Lots of GT and Formula cars are present.

Of course, they're using Slightly Mad Studios' excellent Madness Engine, and have ironed out some bugs and irregularities that were present in the engine, making what was already the most advanced sim racing engine even better.

- Best Weather simulation w/ best in class water body simulation.
- Best real time track evolution (Nothing else comes even close on a technical level)
- Beautiful graphics and lighting.

Overall, very impressed with the sim and the updates they keep bringing to the table, some of the best races I've ever had right here.

Update: with the release of 1.4.x, AMS2 is in a better shape than before. Very enjoyable even though the online experience could be a hit or a miss sometimes. Still the online ranking system is good to have and the time trials are and were great especially when the F1 season was ongoing since reiza matched the tracks (with the ones available of course)

Now after the 1.4 update? Holy Cow. Color me extremely impressed. I've raced the GT4 cars extensively in ACC and they're very very well done. But the GT4 cars in AM2 are way way better like there's no comparison.

The FFB, the way the tires sit on the road, the connection with the track, the predictability on the driving all of it is phenomenal - everything just feels so grounded, responsive, and real.

The 1.4 update (I'm not sure specifically what it changed) really has made this a remarkable driving sim and in my opinion far more in-depth, at least from a driving realism perspective, than ACC at least for the GT4 cars. FFB, physics, tire wear and feel... it all feels so much better done and grounded.

In VR (HP Reverb G2 w/ a 2080 Super) AM is outstanding and far, far outshines ACC in my opinion which is a great accomplishment. 

Having said that it's not perfect... as I would like to see more customization when it comes to a 'race weekend' - different drivers, different teams, a more in-depth 'championship' mode, limits on tire sets stuff like that.

Physics and handling are great, especially with the latest update. And the VR performance is unmatched by any other title, which is a huge plus for me.

Three minor criticisms though:

1: Engineer is mostly silent and unhelpful. However, Crew Chief fully supports AMS2 and is free, easy to use, and is already a familiarity if you use it with AC, iRacing, or other titles. So, this is not a big deal. 

2: AI for fast open-seaters like the modern Formula Ultimate cars can be a little janky. On high difficulty, they are overly-aggressive and bump and block your car in ways that would earn a penalty or a black flag in an actual Formula 1 race. I like aggression and a challenge from my AI, but not at the sacrifice of clean and fair racing...

Even in qualifying, I had an AI opponent pass me in the braking zone and then swerve into my line and park it in front of me while I was trying to set a lap time, which brings em to my third criticism...

3: AI in fast, open-seaters seem to have an unnatural speed advantage on high difficulty settings. After trial and error, I've dialed in an optimal difficulty (for me at least) for Formula racing difficulty at 80-85 with low aggression in order to achieve clean and fair racing. 

With higher difficulty and aggression, they not only bump you off of track and swerve into your line in braking zones, they are simply just faster on straights and exiting corners. For example, during my trial and error with settings for Formula Ultimate 2nd Gen, I made a clean pass through a turn on an optimal line in Spa and got a clean and speedy exit only to still be passed by an AI opponent who went fully off track into the grass, wobbled on its exit when rejoining the track, and was in the marbles while it made its move on me (not in a DRS zone either).

I try to be critical of my own driving and not just ""blame the AI"" for my own shortcomings, but in scenarios like that, the AI is just simply unrealistically faster, but tweaking the difficulty as I mentioned above got it to a place where it feels natural and fun. 

Should note that AI in the other racing series in AMS2 feel a bit more natural when racing at higher difficulties and aggression, it's just with these high speed, high downforce cars that they seem to not know how to drive through corners and receive an unfair speed boost on exiting corners as compensation.

Those criticisms aside, this sim really is becoming my favorite. Great tracks, great cars, fantastic weather system, easy multiplayer (though not as populated as others, but it is growing), and fantastic VR support.",1666895592,1666895592,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Physics and FFB keep improving and are in line, if not better, than in other sims. Everything else though is severely lacking. If you want to hot lap or race in a league, it's great. For everything else, there is still a lot to be done. Online is pretty much barren. AI is easily the worst I've seen in a sim - inconsistent between tracks, super fast in some parts of the track & very slow in others - clearly does not follow the same physics as the player. More often than not, AI simply drives like you're not there and will bump you off the track. Despite great overall physics and pretty good FFB, single player is just not fun at this time since the AI drives so unnaturally. I hope the devs focus on AI and online for v1.5 instead of making more DLC content, even though I'm guessing that's what's keeping the lights on.

Edit: After doing some more AI races... the AI is absolutely trash-tier. All of the characteristics of crappy lazy AI are there. Unreal traction out of slow corners and too slow in fast corner (though can easily go through the kink from the inside line without lifting). Extremely exaggerated weight, so smallest bump will send you into the wall while the AI drives off like nothing happened. Hilarious too observe the AI ""race"" each though - just side bumping each other the whole race without either crashing due to ridiculous weight of their cars.

It has the best graphics of any sim, especially in VR and since the last update the physics are among the best. ACC probably edges it in this aspect but this restricts players to GT3 which is not everyone's cup of tea. The only negative I can think of offhand is being unable to save replays other than by completing online races.

The problem is that with every update of the game, the physics of the cars are tweaked. It makes it VERY DIFICULT to be consistant and learn to be a faster driver. Sometimes, after an update, i'm 2s faster than my previous hard earned personnal best without even trying. Sometimes, I get frustrated not being able to get anywhere close to my personal best. AT LEAST, The leaderbords should be reseted when a car or track is modified so it is fair for everybody who tries to beat the record.

It might be a good game for wheel users but for people like me whose only option is to play with controller AMS2 has basically the same issues that Project Cars 2 has: built-in controller filters that cannot be turned off and cause input lag. 

AMS2 looks good, even if you get only the base game there's a very good selection of cars & tracks, if you get season pass it adds a considerable number of additional cars & tracks. Don't listen to people who complain about South American content in AMS2, the game has a number of very interesting cars & tracks to drive. There's enough variety of cars & tracks in AMS2 that anyone interested in sim racing can find something interesting to drive.
AMS2 runs on the Madness Engine, the same engine used in the Project Cars games, and even though Reiza is working hard to get the best out of the engine there's still issues from PCars that found their way in AMS2. There's some issues with setups (setups not saving properly, having to constantly reset setups), a lot of cars slide way too much imo, and all the controller issues from Project Cars are still present in AMS2 (input lag, no way to disable controller filters and enable raw input and fine tune from there like I could do in AMS1, and controller vibration is almost non-existent). I run AMS2 with mostly high settings and often get micro stutter, my PC specs: i7 4790, 16GB RAM, GTX 1060 6GB, Windows 10 Pro; this micro stutter issue has been reported by many players in the official forums, many of them have PCs better than mine and have the same issue regardless of graphics settings.

I got AMS2 in June 2021, there have been significant changes in car handling since then. While update 1.3 was a step in the right direction the changes that occurred in the past few months seem like a step back for some of the cars I tested, some cars sliding way too much and some cars having issues with tyre overheating and losing grip. Quality and consistency of car handling can vary a lot from one car to another. Update 1.4 has just been released and apparently there's still some hotfixes coming to fix some things. In a little over 1 year I've noticed significant handling changes in different cars and I've lost count of how many times I had to reset my setups because of the updates that changed the handling of the cars. The constant need to reset setups over the past few months cause me to simply stop trying to work on creating custom setups and try to play the game using default setups. That plus the issues with input lag on controller make the game very frustrating to play for me. I have way more fun playing AMS1 than AMS2. AMS2 feels really random: one day a car feels ok, on the next day the same car at the same track with the same setup slides all over the place.

Out of the 220+hrs I have playing AMS2 I'd say over half of that time I spent testing the game, trying to figure out how to get controller to work properly, re-doing car setups after updates that require setup reset, re-learning how to drive cars after updates that changed car handling. I wish I had to spend less time testing things and I could spend more time actually playing and enjoying the game. Like I said previously AMS2 can behave really randomly at times, and this randomness seems to be related to the Madness engine since PCars2 had similar issues.

AI has received a lot of work over the past months but they can be really a hit or miss depending on car & track used. I've had some races where I had some really good battles with AI, but on some races AI is terrible, makes some weird unrealistic moves, and crashes into my car on every turn. The high number of car classes is good in the sense of giving players a variety of options to race but it also makes way more difficult for Reiza to have AI that works well in all car classes at all tracks.

The promised career mode isn't in the game yet, apparently it will be implemented some time in late 2023. There's custom race weekend with a lot of options for single class and multiclass races, dynamic weather (tyre behavior in the wet is still WIP), dynamic time of day, and rules and realism options. There's also custom championships with the same amount of options offered in single race mode, but there's some limitations on championship points system.

Apparently Reiza doesn't care much about controller users and they don't seem worried about implementing the improved controller support they promised back in 2020 anytime soon.
If you're a wheel player you'll probably like AMS2, it has good graphics, good selection of cars and tracks, and you can use custom FFB settings.
If you're a controller player and you liked to play PCarS2 with controller you'll probably like AMS2 as well.
If you're a controller player who uses precision steering, realistic assists, you didn't like PCars2 on controller, and you're expecting controller support in AMS2 to be as good as it was in AMS1 you'll be disappointed.

AMS2 looks good, there's a good number of interesting cars and tracks, I'd love to make this my main sim racing game but unfortunately the controller issues and input lag, and the randomness in handling in a number of the cars make the game very frustrating to play for me.

- the force feedback isn't great on my G923 and I can't properly feel beforehand what is happening to the car in some cases, so I can't anticipate a grip loss or something. I can only react to it.

- UPDATE: I'm having a really bad time trying to navigate the track and specially the car selection UI. The UI behaviour is inconsistent. To see car specs, sometimes I have to hover the car with the cursors, sometimes I have to give an additional click on the car category. Clicking on the car sometimes select it, sometimes show specs.

Could be the general feeling, lacking the refined and connected vibe of those ""better sims"" on the market or just ""let us squeeze as much money as possible with just throwing half baked content all over the place"" approach from the studio behind it.
And my first session with AMS2 did hit my prejudice so well I refunded it in less than 1 hour. Cars didn't drive the way they should, gazillion of cars in gazillion / 2 classes, tracks I have never heard of them before, tracks I had but with different names, unfriendly UX with way too much clicks to find and see anything, confusing DLCs that overlapped in content, promised stuff in some not well defined future ...  I just didn't see myself leaving comfort zone of other sims I was more used to.

I don't remember why I decided to give it another try, but damn I'm glad I did. First thing to address, cars did behave weird because the game didn't save my pedals calibration and break was on full power when I was barely touching it. I had to calibrate and save config twice, apparently it is some Madness engine stuff, at least according to internet. Same engine legacy weirdness is also major pain in the ass when you want to assign axis for ""non-standard"" DD wheel, such as Simucube (disable FF, try to hit rotation limit without any bumps and return back to center or something esoteric like that, from the memory). But it can be done, and it is worth doing it. Because if you pass that entry barrier you get an incredible game that is so much fun to drive, with unique physics feeling unrelated to those others slightly mad games, with constant updates from passionate devs, nice and fast graphics (think something like iRacing fast, but that doesn't look like it was made for laptop from 2005) and ton of content. OK, so Suzuka is called Kansai and Red bull ring is called Steven Spielberg , but you get all sort of not so well known South American tracks (Ibarra <3), different layouts, historical tracks and layouts ... And you can race them with 1300 hp trucks, or 6.8 liters Corollas without any electronics, or modern F1 bolids ...

It is not all rainbow and bunnies. It is still very much in active development, so some cars have a bit rough vibe to them. UX and that madness legacy bullshit could be sorted out. DLCs are still weird (so just get the ""give me all"" one). And online is not as strong as heavy hitters such as ACC and iRacing.

I have been playing this game for over two years now, and the review I wrote back in 2020 deserves a few adjustments. I am very happy by how this game moved along, but there are remaining issues one would hope had been ironed out by now, and new issues have appeared. 

Back when I wrote this review, I told people to buy this game. I still think you're making a good investment if you do, with a lot of vanilla content and generally fairly priced DLC. The driving behaviour is, in my opinion, top notch, especially because the cars behave like I personally would expect them to very often: Reiza Studios have given the game a big physics overhault recently that has truly put the sim on another level, fixing long-standing issues such as the bouncy nature of the cars and making some cars heavier and more grounded in terms of feel.

After countless, countless of physics changes, it seems like the game has finally arrived where it wants to be.

What still is true from the review I wrote: 

Selling Point #1: Reiza Studios are relentless. There are ambitious plans for the game, and they keep on working, keep on delivering (there's a caveat here though) and keep on improving the sim. Nearly every single month, there's an update to look forward to, and it's never a step back. This game is a journey to enjoy, one where the horizons generally tend to get brighter. 

Sometimes, it still feels like the workload is huge, and the game definitely has a long way to go still until it is a finished product - but there is fun to be had with what's on offer already, and there's fun to be had in seeing it evolve.

Selling point #2: Multiplayer. There are many bad things about the current multiplayer, but there's one perk I still think to be underrated:
No other sim except for Project CARS 2 can be picked up and played the way this can. You do not have to fiddle with setting up servers, you can simply set up your own lobby to your liking within a minute, and have great races with friends. 

Selling point #3: Obscure content. For many people, many weird Brazilian race cars that look like fantasy cars, and many Brazilian tracks that most never heard of, might be a turn-off. However. There are real gems in between. The Stock Cars are pretty exciting to drive, just as the small ARC Camaros make for brilliant cars to battle with. The Sprint Cars are basically rear-powered TCR-cars, which, for me, is an ideal compromise. 
And for the tracks ... if you have never driven on Guaporé, or Ibarra circuit, or on Cascavel, or on Curvelo - I'd say you've missed out on something. These don't sound quite as mythical as Nordschleife, or Spa-Francorchamps (both of which, incidentally, have come to this game for fair prices), but I assure you that doesn't stop them from being just as fun.

Selling point #4: VR-support. If you own a VR device, buying is basically a no-brainer, because there is no comparable performing sim for VR on the market.

Selling point #5: F1 cars. If you're an F1 fan, this has F1 cars from nearly every era you might think of. Most aren't licensed, but they still, at least to me, feel like proper representations of their respective area - and fitting skins can be found on RaceDepartment. Also, there are some interesting details in here - like the '97 McLaren, which had an additional brake pedal that is recreated in the sim.

Selling point #6: This is the biggest thing that changed from when I originally wrote this review. Selling point 6 was the communication of the developer, but that has completely turned on its head to the negative; we'll get to that.

Selling point #7: The AI are continually improved, continually enhanced, and they have gotten to a point where, if you manage to find a combination where they are roughly on your pace (which is by far not as hard as it used to be), they are very likely to provide a fun experience. They take mostly realistic lines, they will race you, and while it's sometimes noticeable that they have different physics, it doesn't detract from the overall satisfying experience that (now the physics are stable) will be enhanced even more.

Now we have tackled AMS2's strengths, it's time for the weaknesses. The game does have some, and I don't want to hide that it does. 

First of all, multiplayer has several long-standing issues, and the developer seems very unsure of how to tackle them, which has lead to a situation where nothing has been done to these issues for over a year. Lobbies with more than 20 people are very unstable and suffer from mass disconnects and synchronisation issues, there is an issue where, if the host is AFK, the lobby can not progress from qualifying and everyone's time gets wasted, and sometimes, lobbies will just fail randomly. It's a 4 in 5 chance that things will work out, but that still does mean some guaranteed frustration. Because of this and the lack of scheduled races, the multiplayer is still not very populated.

The next issue is AI consistency. When you managed to get them roughly to the speed you're at, you're going to have excellent races most of the time. However, you might have to fiddle a bit - the ARC Camaro AI on 100 difficulty is just a second slower than me, whereas I leave the Formula V10's in the dust by four seconds on the same difficulty. You can adjust difficulty from 70 to 120, but a bit of fiddling is required most of the time. There is solid grounds to hope that this will get better, but certainty is, sadly, not the strength of this sim.

This is maybe my biggest current gripe: Following this game and its updates is frustrating. The developer will continue to announce things that then get pushed back, sometimes indefinitely. Some paid DLC content is still not complete and every date it was supposed to come out has been missed by a country mile (there were historic versions planned that have been WIP for about two years now). The developer consistently tells his customers that he'll have something done by a certain date and consistently misses that date.

Whereas communication has been a strong part of AMS2, it is now maybe the weakest of them all, with self-imposed deadlines not met even concerning very basic and problem-free things like a simple forum post - more often than not, these delays also don't get announced (or they get announced ~1 minute before the deadline) and users are left wondering what's happened.

That regular frustration is something every user of this product must learn how to deal with, as there is no incentive to change this in order to deliver content quicker.

Finally, the game does not support modding. I'm not sure it makes a difference, though, because the track list is pretty impressive (~40 locations, and many of these have very different historical versions). 
The car list is as of yet a bit unbalanced (somewhat biased towards formula cars (25) and historic Brazilian touring cars (12)), but according to the development roadmap, that will have changed by December (when the aforementioned touring cars, GT3 cars and Group C/GT1 cars will have been added to the game).

For me, AMS2 has been the most worthwhile sim game I've purchased. 
Join now, and watch as a (not-anymore-so) ragged diamond is carefully carved to perfection.

Je to prakticky stejný problém jako u Project Cars. Auta se chovají celkem realisticky ale jen do chvíle než začnete auto tlačit na hranu nebo za hranu. Například když zatočíte kola v zatáčce adekvátně k přilnavosti tak je vše ok ale když v té samé chvíli v zatáčce zatočíte víc tak je přilnavost na přední nápravě stále stejná a na zadku máte pocit že se auto sklouzne.To samé když při zatáčení přecházíte z brzd na plyn - žádný přenos váhy v souvislosti na přilnavost pneumatik necítíte. To je úplně proti reálným fyzikálním zákonům. Starý engine prvního dílu automobilisty byl v tomto daleko reálnější. Proto tuhle hru jako simulátor nedoporučuji. 
Na nějaké to normální hraní by však hra byla dobrá, ne perfektní (chybí mi tu nějaká kampaň a systém bodování ve hře více hráčů) ale výběr aut a tratí je skvělý. Grafika není špatná, pár detailů bych udělal jinak ale není to nic co by kazilo herní zážitek.

Recent updates brings some cars almost to perfection. Having casual fun with older Formulas, or taking some slow, old cars around Autodromo Yahuarcocha in changing conditions is brilliant way of spending my time lately. I'm even happy that I didn't rush and buy F1 22, instead I'm thinking of spending that money on extra content for AMS2. I'm really glad I gave this title another chance. What really melts my brain is that I run now a custom championship in Ginettas G55 on UK tracks, and when you start in march, trees are bald, there are no leaves, colors are more gloomy, but come may, everything starts to get more vibrant and colorful - season changes really gives this game a unique look.
Of course, game is not without its issues - for me, a singlist, the AI, but this is a problem for all sims out there - they are OK in general, racing clean, make mistakes on their own sometimes, but on some tracks they get much slower than on the others. 
For me AMS2 reached the top to stand alongside ACC as my favourite sim, next is F1 2021 (for career mode mainly), and then... nothing (I didn't play iR in a few years, so no comment on that title). AC is great with mods, but starts to feel dated and I don't have more time for it, and rF2 has only ffb to offer in my opinion - and also looks dated. RaceRoom has irritating AI, so not my speed.
Summing up, if you're looking for great a-v experience fueled by pretty good handling and tyre models, this game is for you. If you're more a carrer person, go for ACC or F1 2020-21. And if name of your game is online competition, iRacing or RaceRoom should be your cup of tea. HAVE FUN OUT THERE! :)

Over 50 tracks and 150+ variations now….I am a huge (pre-Netflix lol) F1 fan and naturally have played the F1 licensed games despite the lack of simulation.  With the new F1 2022 cars in this game, make a custom championship (up to 25 races) all over the world.  You can still have about half of the actual F1 tracks, but man oh man… this is insanely fun.  The single player campaign is not out yet, but you can make your own content with the custom championships.  If you like endurance racing, put the endurance tracks you like, make a season championship.  If you like GT3, make your own season… older F1 generations also with like 10+ historic tracks which you never see in any game… the custom championships is where the fun is if your not playing online.  The AI are awesome to fight… they rarely drive all in a straight line.  They will fight you, they will drive off track, make mistakes, spin out.  For F1 there are so many amazing NON F1 tracks all over the world in this game its awesome to explore them.  Fighting wheel to wheel… this game is the F1 2022 game we deserve.

I don't want to be a racing sim snob, so no technical jargon here. Simply put, the audio is outstanding, the physics are top notch. and the racing 'feel' is 10/10. it just feels 'right', and fun. There are plenty of options to make it the kind of game you want. Everything from hardcore sim to a driving assisted more approachable experience.

I've seen accolades for the A.I. and after several A.I. races I have to agree, they are pretty good. Not perfect, but definitely will rank among the best in that department.

The visuals are where they should be in 2022, and there's plenty of options there as well. Racing sims are famously easy on framerate, so even lesser PC's should be able to manage 60 fps with the right settings.

There are a lot of tracks and cars in the base game, but most of the famous tracks & cars are going to be DLC. Reiza is a Brazillian company, and their sims have a heavy Brazillian racing influence, so you'll see a lot of that country's cars and tracks in the default selection. 

If you are wondering, yes, Reiza does put their sims on a solid discount during sales. Also, if you own AMS 1, be sure to check the store page for a 'Complete Your Collection' discount. I snagged the base game for just $18 (!).

The game is impossibly hard to drive on just a controller. The only cars I'm actually able to drive somewhat confidently are GT3 cars.

I wish there was flashbacks as well for when you feel like doing a casual race.

The tracks are pretty solid that come with the base game but AMS2's Nurburgring is a must buy, whether you get the premium track packs or not. AMS2 also has a great range of cars to drive such as GT4, GT3, Formula cars of many generations, Cup cars, Stock Cars, Copa trucks, P1 and the list goes on for the base game.

Came back to AMS2 after the release of F1 2022 just to see the difference in VR. Found out they have a gen 2 car, there is an F1 2022 skin mod and driver names. Plus tried some VR tweaks to AMS2 with VR performance kit and the openvr performance upgrade.

This game is hands down the best F1 2022 driving experience. VR looks amazing, the gen 2 car is so much fun to drive.

Essentially containing a number of sets to play with that you can take the training wheels off of whenever YOU want to. 

On top of an engine that looks fantastic. It handles great on multiple screens cranked up to 11 or in VR cranked up there as well on decent spec hardware while still allowing users who cannot break the bank to enjoy a great looking title too.

What I've noted over the years I was watching the game was this: A similar release to other older titles where the bare bones was in the game (except the bones here was many structurally recognisable cars with basic physics attached). Once these bones were in people would flock to Reiza's forums and tell them about whatever issues there are. Reiza then focused in on each category, getting it just right while still releasing new content. 

It's now in a position where the game feels great on pretty much any discipline you take it into. They still need to pull up a few things but the base game and its DLC are far beyond what they started with. 

The only improvements I wish to 'hear' next is in the sound department. While I don't expect RaceRoom levels of finesse I would like the sounds to actually mimic the cars they are based on rather than still having that base model sound. I'm not an expert in this field but having bounced between multiple titles there is definitely a difference there. 

Visual improvements I'd be glad to have are related more to the little details such as tyres matching selections and more race features added such as seeing safety cars drive out.Not a must at the moment though as their focus appears to be in the right places and I don't want to pull them from the important things (physics, race car detail and some other disciplines).

Great immersion: Runs well in VR at high settings on a 3090 until you have a large grid and have some CPU intensive cross overs during day/night transitions or adverse weather changes.

That said, I find myself enjoying it less these days when compared to even Vanilla AC content BEFORE mods. 

Multiplayer racing can be hit or miss -- usually it's hit with too wide a ping gap between drivers to enforce any kind of clean racing. Better experiences had in ACC despite it's lack of breadth or variety, or Race Room Experience.
Single Player AI is OK -- nothing special or noteworthy other than they can be brutally fast in certain conditions -- a problem way back no doubt inherited from the PC2 days.

Overall it is a casual sim IMO: You can adjust AI difficulty if you don't want to bother with going crazy on car setup; head to time trial mode, grab a world record setup available from top 10 page, and tweak it if necessary.

I'm loving the P3 class and the Brazilian Stock cars atm.  While it has a lot of the classic tracks you expect to see, the Brazilian tracks is a nice bit of unique content (as far as I can tell).  The open wheel racing is fun as well.  The GT4 cars feel good, but that and GT3 I think I still leave to ACC given it's more specialized and more variety in those classes. What is here though is good.  

This sim has just hit the sweet spot for me personally as of late though.  Highly recommend the DLC as well.  You can get away without it if strapped for cash, but it is excellent content.  If you pick it up a bit over time and during sales it's not too much of a shock.  Base game has plenty you can enjoy if you don't want to commit to all that at once.  I just recently picked up the Racin USA DLC and I'm glad I did.  Premium Track pack is a no-brainer if you love those tracks.",1655184776,1655184776,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While most of the cars are not officially licensed,  DO NOT LET THAT STOP YOU FROM GETTING THIS GAME.

The ""sprint car"" (think small v8 supercar with rigid suspension) is also a blast to use.  I honestly cant praise this game enough, and with the recent announcements, it can only get better from here.

EDIT After 84 more hours played and 1 year: 

My initial review spoke about a lack of licensed content. This had actually started to be corrected right after my posting. in the 2 years since i originally wrote this they have added Mercedes, BMW, Mclaren, VW, Cadillac, Porsche, Chevrolet, Mini, Lotus, ETC.  They have also added popular series like GT3/GT4. the GTE cars are, imo, the best out of any sim.

You remember Project CARS 2, which was released in 2017 by a company who later backstabbed their fanbase in 2020 with an abomination of a sequel known as Project CARS 3? (cough cough, SlightlyMad Studios) Like pCARS 2, AMS2 is also using SMStudio's Madness Engine. pCARS 2 was such an enjoyable game and although I still find myself coming back to it from time to time, [u] it pales horribly in comparison to Reiza's second installment that is this game.[/u] Either because of cars feeling like I'm driving them on ice, stupidly unrealistic kerbing behaviour which, when you go over them, makes your car spin 180 degrees, or horribly inaccurate track models, you name it. Therefore, a love-and-hate relationship between me and that game emerged. Things take a [b] huge [/b] turn for the better with AMS2 though, here's why:

Let's talk about the development team behind AMS2 - They're trying their absolute hardest to make this project more than a game, they're trying to make AMS2 something everyone can enjoy. Despite the game being more than two years old, Reiza are still releasing updates for this title. At the time of writing this review, the latest update came sixteen days ago and they're showing no signs of stopping.

Content-wise, there are much more cars and tracks for you to try out than what this game's predecessor got in its hands. Although much of the content is from AMS1, they're licensed this time around. The amount of content is so high that whether you're an F1 fan, CART enthusiast, GT racing freak, IMSA lover, V8 Supercars enjoyer and whatever you wanna name, you're almost guaranteed to have an enjoyable race no matter what happens, the reason for this is linked to my third clause.

I can't help but talk about the AI - my God am I having the best time racing against the AI of AMS2 when I'm feeling down. In my case, I set the AI skill to 90% and AI aggression to 70%. They're very clean, competitive and racing against them is highly rewarding. This sim should be your choice if you're looking to develop your racecraft.

And now comes the miscellaneous stuff. AMS2 has mod support but only for skins. This might come as a disappointment for the fans of the original Automobilista but fear not, mod creators are finding ways to even create car mods for this game. Like its predecessor, this game is also perfectly playable with an XInput controller.

My conclusion then, if you're looking to start your simracing career, AMS and AMS2 should pretty much be your go-tos. Realistic physics, diverse content, being able to play this game with ease as a controller player, compelling AI - that straight up is a nine out of ten from me. There's still a long way to go for this game to become the ultimate simulator but as I said before, the devs are working day and night to fix the ongoing issues. Oh and the graphics-to-performance ratio is pretty satisfying as well. Thank you for reading.",1653335467,1653427171,True,39,1,0.791507899761199951,0,True,False,False

Games like GRID and F1 franchise were just becoming way to arcadey and frankly a bit of a joke to play. A problem i found with a lot of sims is that they are just sims, AMS2 does just enough of a job for me to cross over into a ""game"" and not just a ""sim"". It looks and sounds amazing, the menus are easy to enough to navigate about to get you racing quickly in a championship or whatever you want. There is a lot of DLC, but at least its actually content and not a skinpack or a helmet pattern. Speaking of skins, all the mods in the world available on Racedepartment as well as custom AI setting if you want to recreate your favourite year in F1 or Indycar. If you're a fan of historical series in general then this is a must especially for 90s cars.

Car selection 2 (a lot of cars but not a single category standout)

Raceroom was for a bit after their FFB update last year but AMS2 took to the lead with consistent improvements and great new content. AMS2 is ""the best"" for driving feel, VR, graphics, weather, variety, load time and overall environment. The weather and time of day models create just mind blowing experiences. There are a lot of unique cars and tracks along with most of the standards you see every where else but they also have historic versions of locations - Red Bull Ring (Speilberg), Monza, Kyalami, Hockemheim ring, and more available. The 10 best sim racing experiences I have had have been in AMS2, most of them on historic versions of the tracks with period correct cars with a car correct shifting (manual, sequential, paddle) - BMW M1 Pro car on historic RBR/Speilberg and '74 Porsche 911 RSR on Kyalami are brilliant. Open wheels span eras too including a generic 2022 F1, 90's Indycar, historic F1, and go karts. The variety is astounding and I'm no where near trying all the cars and tracks yet. 
Is it perfect? Nope, but Reiza continues to improve it and communicates with the community on a regular basis. Multiplayer is the main weakness and admittedly I only race online with a club not in the public servers, and even then we have some issues. Setting up my DD wheel was also a challenge and seems it's still a problem. It doesn't detect it correctly but I'm so glad I kept trying. Search online about the issue and you'll find the solution. I'm not sure what I did specifically to get it to work, sorry. The replay interface could be better too by adding more playback and camera options.
Wrap up: for pure driving fun and immersion, this is my go to sim. If you're looking for competitive online public racing, look at iRacing (which is a lot more $$$$ and doesn't feel and look nearly as good imo) as they have the best system with the most users for online. If you only want to race GT3 and online, look at ACC. If you want to race online in the best looking and driving sim, find a group to race with that focuses on AMS2. I rarely touch ACC, AC, and iRacing, and only play Raceroom for league series now.

Edit: For FFB, I use a custom FFB file that can be found on the Reiza forums. I've heard the default+ FFB is similar and built in to AMS2 so I'd suggest trying that out first.",1651778852,1652641299,True,8,0,0.613729894161224365,0,True,False,False

Now however things are different.. Dates are missed all the time, so much they've given up on giving dates as releases are always missed with excuses as to why..
Reiza Studios also bans people on every social media platform if they have any real critiques about the game, regardless of how much positive things you've said in the past, or how much positive influence you've had on the game...
The game has huge potential..but Devs now lack the drive they used to have, massive bugs are ignored for literal years, not wanted content is added over actually fixing game breaking bugs...
Should you buy it?.....only if your happy with being dissapointed that the promised scheduled online racing still hasnt dropped, after the MP ranked ""beta"" was released in december last year...
only if your hhappy to have cars constantly change and usually stay handling like crap because the devs only listen to reiza backers on the forum, of whom say everything is perfect regardless of the truth...
wait 2 years, then buy it... hopefully by then they'll have actualy finished the season pass content, because at the rate they are going, it'll take that long...

By far the best racing sim on the market.  its the most fun, prettiest, best ffb you'll get.  with every update the team manages to address as much as possible the community asks for which is excellent.

Handling: 10/10 feels realistic, i want to say more about handling but idk what to say lol
Accessibility: 10/10 with other games like rf2, its hard to get it feel right with my wheel, but in ams2 its just a few clicks and a few minutes of testing and away you go!
Physics: 6/10 crash physics aren't great, cars bounce around easy but when it works, it works okay. but i'm sure they'll update it in a few years or so.
Weather: 9/10 its like rf2, rain is really realistic and other weather affects work.
Price: 3/10 the base game price is fine but for a good experience its better with the dlc's, which i got the season pass including all dlc for 177 australian dollars! not entirely worth that much its probably worth around 60 bucks.
Tracks: 10/10 they've recreated the tracks faithfully to the real thing, especially the historic tracks.
Mods: 8/10 This is a new game but people have already made so many mods, most are skins which are amazing but there aren't many tracks or cars. hopefully one day they might implement the steam workshop like rf2 did, but mods now are pretty good.
Cars: 10/10 there are just so many cars, im blown away!
Final score: 8/10 buy it if you have money to spend and a wheel to use!

However, Reiza studios have put an insane amount of work into this game and - as of this moment - it has become by far my favorite racing sim.

Here's a list of the things I really like:
[list]
    [*]Best VR support I've ever dealt with, on par or better than iRacing. It is extremely easy to hop into VR or switch back to normal monitors and you don't have to spend hours messing with settings (although there's a bunch to play with if you wish)
    [*]Really good FFB, this is probably largely a preference thing but I think you can really feel the cars through the wheel, especially with their most recent tire and differential update.
    [*]Multiplayer WITH AI - This is seriously the best part of this game. If you have a group of friends and still want a full grid you can totally do it. Plus ovals are coming soon! Full grid oval, yes please!
    [*]The weather simulation is next level. We're talking wet spots, differing weather on different parts of the track, dry lines starting to appear as the weather improves, lightning, wind. It's all there.
    [*]Finally, there's a huge selection of cars and tracks especially if you pick up the DLCs. And if you don't, you just need to find a friend that does - you can race together on DLC tracks even if only one of you owns it.
[/list]

Some things I find annoying:
[list]
    [*]The AI is fun but still acts weird at times. Especially if there are multiple classes, they'll randomly get stuck behind traffic for no reason and then suddenly swerve to pass and smash into you. Sometimes the same difficulty settings will be turtle slow on one track and insanely fast on another. Little things like that - although this too has improved a ton.
    [*]Not a hugely active multiplayer scene or very good ranked multiplayer support. If you don't have a group of friends or a community you're a part of already, then you may have trouble finding random races or you'll need to seek out a group to experience that side of the game.
    [*]Physics feel a bit funny on some cars. The latest tire/diff update hasn't rolled out to every car as of yet, and you can really feel a massive difference.
[/list]

Overall, I'd highly recommend this game for anyone who either loves to race against AI, and/or has a group of friends to play with. Or anyone who just loves sim racing in general. However, this game is not an iRacing replacement.

Being a fan of Reiza's previous sims, I bought into AMS 2 the day it released into Early Access a couple of years ago. At that time it was very rough, missing basic features, and was full of issues, as you'd expect from an EA product. However, I was confident that Reiza would get it all sorted for the full release.

A few months later my faith in Reiza took it's first hit. They announced the end of the EA period, despite the fact that the sim was [i]nowhere near[/i] what anyone would consider to be a decent state, let alone finished. They claimed it was always the plan, as AMS 2 was intended to be an ""ongoing project"". But if that was the case, then why bother with EA in first place? Or why not keep the EA tag (and the lower price point) until the ""project"" is complete? But no, the release went ahead, and the price went up. Not ideal.

Soon after this, my faith in Reiza took it's second hit. They announced the first paid DLCs. Paid DLCs for a sim that was still missing basic functionality and was still brimming with bugs in both it's base features and it's existing content. Paid DLCs for what was basically an alpha product that was still some way off of the beta stage. There was even a ""season pass"" costing as much as the base sim, so that you could get your hands on all the latest broken content for one flat price. Unbelievable.

Over the ensuing months my faith in Reiza fell away to nothing in a series of hits, thanks to their patches. Each one clearly had a lot of time and effort put into it, judging by the extensive change logs. However, each one was also thrown out the door without any internal testing of any kind whatsoever. Either that, or Reiza simply don't care about quality. Most patches introduced as many issues as they claimed to fix, and much of the new content they brought with them was deeply flawed, some of it to the point of being unusable. Pathetic.

This policy of using the game's community, people paying full price for what they believe to be a complete product, as a bunch of alpha-testers was completely unacceptable in my view. It was at this point, after a year of defending the sim from it's naysayers in the sim-racing community, that I finally turned my back on Reiza and AMS 2. The naysayers were right, and I was wrong.

A year later, making it two years since the initial release, I decided to revisit AMS 2 to see what progress had been made, if any. Surely by this time it would be a somewhat passable sim, wouldn't it?

[b][i]Nope.[/i][/b]

Within minutes of firing up the sim I was confronted with old issues that have existed since day one, have been reported by numerous people (including myself), and yet have been ignored entirely by Reiza. Some of the missing core features are now in, but most are unfinished and require further development. The clunky interface and HUD which was supposed to be getting an overhaul a year ago is still the same as it was when I quit twelve months ago. Many classes still lack even the most basic racing liveries, something the community could fix themselves within a month if only AMS 2 was moddable. Also, by reading the change logs of the last few patches, it is clear that Reiza are still struggling with the absolute basics of the sim itself two years after ""release"", and after at least two more in internal development beforehand.

What about the actual driving, you ask? You could potentially forgive at least some of the above if the fundamentals allowed you to see the huge potential the sim has beneath it's rough exterior. But they don't.

Driving in this sim is entirely uninspiring and just not much fun at all, quite frankly. For me personally, the graphics seem too bright and saturated, giving the sim a slightly cartoony look. The car's engine fires up and you're greeted with a hollow, badly sampled noise that sounds like it came from a ""sim"" on the Atari ST in the 90s. The force feedback feels dead and completely uninformative on a T300, leaving you guessing on what the car is doing beneath you. Many of the cars themselves feel strangely unresponsive, and almost like they are rotating on a central pivot rather than on their tyres. As for the AI, after two years of tweaking and patching, it is still by far the worst I have come across in a modern sim. It's laughable watching them trying to drive on their own, as after lap two of a practice session all of a track's corner markers will have been destroyed by the incompetent AI on their outlap. In traffic during a race, it's either a procession or a demolition derby, and you can forget about going door to door if you want to make it out of the next corner alive.

In all, there are just a few classes which appear to have seen more work from Reiza, and do provide at least some enjoyment. The Caterhams are the stand-out class of the sim, the Mini Challenge can be fun online, and the 80's F1 cars can be an interesting challenge. But everything else is either forgettable, or just plain rubbish.

For me, AMS 2 has shown Reiza in their true colours. Their previous sims were created on the back of a very well known, very well documented simulation engine that had already produced many great sims. They were able to easily tweak it to their own needs, making the bulk of the work content creation and general polishing. This time around they've gone for an engine that few are familiar with. Customising it to their own requirements, while simultaneously creating quality content and polishing the sim, has proved to be far too much for their limited abilities. Put simply, Reiza have bitten off far more than they can chew.

[b]TLDR;[/b] Automobilista 2 has been supported by (some of) the sim-racing community due to the previous reputation of it's developer, and not on it's own merit. After many years in development, two of them in the public domain and eighteen months after exiting Early Access, the sim is barely a beta product and nowhere near complete in any way. With Reiza's slipshod working practices, reliance on customers as testers, and general lack of apparent ability, I don't see this changing anytime soon. If it ever is ""complete"", it'll be around the time that everyone else is releasing the next generation of racing simulations, leaving this one out of date and in the dust... even more so than it already is.

Overall, there are far, far better alternatives out there for racing sim fans, and they all provide a better driving experience than AMS 2 for the same... if not less... money. Do yourself a favour and buy one of them instead.",1651230849,1651230849,False,8,4,0.522881805896759033,0,True,False,False

Excellent graphics and smooth performance. It will run on last gen cards at near max settings. Menu and UI are a bit dated but manageable. Mapping controls is tricky if not buggy. Ultimately you will be able to set your controls  correctly if you are patient and restart enough times. Sound is immersive and adaptability to use weather system & seasons is a must have.  Variety of interesting car classes will keep you hooked, however most cars have limited licensing and in-house liveries are ugly. Physics modeling are generally good and appear realistic, but it's not among the best. Cars are predictable and all tend to understeer in a strange way. Most cars are balanced in a way that you can exceed limitations with minor penalties. I don't know if this is normal, but not how other sims behave. FFB generally is detailed and enjoyable, but not nearly as good as ACC / AC / RF2.  Still quite a fun ride, and would highly recommend.

To direct drive wheelbase users...
For some reason FFB can sometimes have severe unexpected spikes and if you use a DD wheel at high torque settings this game that can seriously harm your fingers or wrists. From my experience, there is hardly any safety measures to prevent maximum force applied at the wrong moment. No, this is not a plus and it's not really immersive, it's the opposite. It's somewhat scary since the oscillations and huge FFB spikes /differences with terrain / crashes /  impact / etc. will force you to down rate your % FFB at the source (FFB driver) and thereby greatly reduces overall experience. For what it's worth, in every other title I can use 100% FFB with high torque as long as the GAIN setting in game is managed correctly (around 35-40% for DD1). AMS2 is the exception. Coming from a Logitech G923>  Fanatec CSW2.5> Fanatec DD1, all have been fun on this game, but use caution on the DD wheel bases until developer decides to set resources aside to fix these problems.",1650085232,1650085232,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After every patch people have problems with they controllers, physic feels little better than a year ago but nothing special.

Some rf2 mods drive and feel 100x times better than AMS 2 original content (like Group-C)

For me and this is my own opinion AMS 2 is not worth the cash. Stay with AMS 1 or go for rf2.

So after the new Update nothing really changed, FFB is still crap, the old content still bad, the new content is only shiny crap.

REIZA is changing from a very good SIM Developer to the type of Motorsport Games or worst.......

Hahahaha I see REIZA DEv's don't like critics, now I have a perma ban on Steam Automobilista 2 Community Forum .... but I still will post my opinion till you fix the problems : I still will say that Automobilista 2 FFB is crap like Project Cars 2 and REIZA is drifting in the direction like MotorSport Games ..... money grabbing for contents  :)

Hope you will go back the roots of AMS1 .......

As a racing game there is fun to be had here there is a great selection of cars and circuits  to race on and options are variable. The FFB with a wheel is good, but not great, and varies with car. It can be really good at times but the damping feel is not complete and it doesn't always tell you what you feel it should. I get more noise about the track surface but less about the cars back end. Many cars in this game seem quite scrubby and never seem to find a level of confident grip you'd expect. 

But by far biggest issue with this game is the same as I had before, which is that a lot of the glitches and UI issues there are in this game are all the issues that existed in Project CARS 2, which this game shares the engine of. Much are small blips that will get ironed out, but the fact so much still exists in a game which claims to be in a finished state, is very disappointing. The whole UI really needs reworking. Everything from the menu selections and the menus themselves, to the in game HUD and ICM menu during the race needs an overhaul. 

That being said, I do find it gives me a fun experience with certain vehicles and it is easy to pick up a and play. If like me you own an HMD, then the VR here is great and just works. For that alone it's probably a great way to have fun. As for online, there are better options and it's easy to create a lobby to just drop in and out with friends. Just don't try complex races or you'll be frustrated at trying to manage them. 

So it's difficult not to recommend, but only if you either, own a VR headset or are willing to stick with it for the long term. The developer is very committed, seem to be working so hard to improve things and are clearly so passionate about the task at hand that you cannot help but feel they will succeed. But it's a tall order. The game need to shed its PC 2 ghost that haunts it, and gain its true Reiza soul before it will be something people take seriously alongside the best racing sims.

NOTE: So i am just adding a note to reflect the extra time I have had with the game. There have been many improvements to the game, extra stuff (cars an circuits), as ever and FFB, physics and interface changes. The online mode has gotten a bit better from what I hear, but haven't delved into that myself. All I can say is again, that it's not as good as it could be. Much of my gripes are with how the user interface works, setups, plus the In-Car Menu (which is at least simpler and tidier now) is still stuck in a silly place for my Super Ultrawide, and a few graphical options here and there. But there is a great selection of cars, tracks (old and historic) and it will keep getting better. For pick up and play racing, for many people this will be worth a look... and there's a demo!

They are constantly adding cars and tracks and are always active with updates and they continue to respond very well to their user base.

I feel that not only is this my most enjoyable Sim title to race with but I can confidently assume that it also will be for the future going forward!

I also feel that It is the best Sim for VR play.  Not only for its ease in spitting out the visuals (relatively speaking) but also, for its integrity, as their isn't a sim racing title that can run as stable on VR as AMS2 can.

The Good: 
This game is basically a sandbox full of cars and tracks to do whatever you please. Brazilian Stock Cars at Daytona? Sure. Formula Trucks racing with 125cc go-karts? Absolutely. This game is one of few racing titles that offers so much freedom to setup custom races however you want. 
Graphics and audio come together fantastically to provide a very immersive experience... when the game works.

The bad:
Unfortunately, what would be one of the most immersive racing sims falls just short. Audio would be perfection, if it weren't for the lack of a voiced spotter or race engineer. You can turn on subtitles for the spotter, but you can't hear them.
Despite a huge variety of car classes to choose from, some classes feel phoned in and incomplete between some cars being generic to some lacking a damage model, despite the game having one of the best visual damage models.
AI can easily break your immersion thanks to being equipped with ARCA brakes and sometimes inexplicably forgetting you're beside them despite initially giving you room and door checking you hard enough to send you into the barrier.
Car handling/physics are hit or miss. Generally, the handling feels like the Need for Speed: Shift games, feeling a bit twitchy and bouncy (everyone compares this to Project Cars, but I've never played that series so-.) Some cars feel good, like the Brazilian Stock Cars. Unfortunately, GT3 cars and a few other classes feel almost out of control at all times. They just feel wrong and I absolutely do not recommend this game if you're looking to race mainly GT3's, stick to ACC for that.
Bugs? Plenty. Body panels I've had fly off my car sometimes reappear a lap later despite still having the same aero damage according to the HUD. I've seen cars fall halfway through the ground. Sometimes heavy collisions break the physics. Liveries/textures not loading on cars at all. Trackside replay camera mode getting stuck on one camera, giving you a great view of just the track infield. The bugs really hammer home the Early Access feel.

One more note, while there's a solid variety of cars and tracks, they're mostly Brazilian tracks and cars, so you'll have to purchase DLC for courses like Daytona or Nurburgring or if you want GT3 and GTE cars. Another reason to purchase this game while on sale.

In summary, there's certainly fun to be had here and there's a lot of potential here, just don't expect the most polished experience.",1648924068,1648924068,True,8,2,0.600389540195465088,0,True,False,False

I still don't agree with it's price but they have actually built something special here. It has all clicked for me now, the physics, the looks, the FFB, it is all top notch. 

UPDATE 3/22: Revisiting the game after a bunch of updates and I'm definitely a bit more impressed this time. The default + steering is a big upgrade and feels great to me. All the custom wheel configs are horrible IMO, stay away from those. My original conclusion stands though, this game is nowhere near worth it's price. The full game with all available content is worth $40 tops IMO. Still a no buy from me. 

This game ranges from pretty to good to absolutely terrible depending on the car track combo. 

It doesn't look it great in VR and the optimization isn't very good either. The cars sound pretty heartless to me as well, at least in the cockpit and the interior and exterior model leaves a bit to be desired. 

All in all, it's okay. If I could go back in time, I would have given up on tweaking it before the two hour refund window ended. $130 for what I got is just absolutely bananas. I feel robbed.

Physic: Compared to Pcars2 this game has some mind blowing realistic F1 Cars and im pretty sure there are other nice cars with really good physics, but i also saw in just 2 hours atleast 4 other cars where the physic really feels weak and as bad designed as in Pcars2 and some cars even weaker, reiza really need to look into it, there is some night and day difference in relations to physics/cars.

Graphics: The wet weather system feels like a additional improvement above Pcars2, in pcars2 there is a bullet time cloud when the cars driving on the wet track, but in AMS2 the effect is not this generic and looks alot more believable.

The whole track looks also a little bid sharper/cleaner in AMS2 in VR but i also saw some blurry spotts here and there, but still no big deal... i think most people won't see them.

On the other side, all in all i still think Pcars2 looks nicer atleast on some tracks details and road textures (but its depends on the track) and holy crap this 2D (Sprites) TREE's in AMS2 are a BIG DOWNGRADE in VR. A total immersion killer, when the Tree's are closer to the Track like in Bathurst, the closer you pass them, the faster they turn into your direction, it feels like you spectated by all this Tree's. Lord of the Rings incoming ;). THIS IS A TOTAL IMMERSION KILLER, 2 years is this game out and there is no option to disable this crap and why is no one talking about it? WTF going on with this community? Reiza, give us the option to reduce the turning/movement speed from the Tree's or even complet disable it. Pcars2 has 3D Tree's and it looks so much better there, atleast when you pass them.

Performance: Even with this reduced Details in AMS2 (playing with identical graphicsettings) and after playing 2 hours Pcars2 and 2hours AMS2 right after each other.
The performance is almost identical and on some maps the performance is even weaker in AMS2! After 2 years i expect more from this game and when i look at pcars1 ""(and yes im talking about pcars1 specially with the same madness engine) yes 1-2 effects better improved in pcars2 it this takes (GPU) fps away but its no big difference, atleast when im only looking at the visuals, the physics (CPU demanding) is much better in pcars2 even so in AMS2 this could also reduce FPS. All in all compared to pcars1 the same Engine (today) has much weaker fps performance for my 5k Resolution VR Device, im talking atleast about 30% weaker performance when im changing from pcars1 to pcars2 (tested on the same Map with the same Graphic settings and in Time Trial) and maybe additional 5-10% weaker performance when playing AMS2.

FFB: I only used Default+ on AMS2 and it feels okayish but compared to my custom FFB files from Jack Spade the FFB feels much better in Pcars2. But its not a fair statement till im also tested the rFuktor custom FFB files, im already downloaded version 5.0.1.3 but i will edit my review when i had the time to look into it.

I hope Reiza will improve AMS2 over time, but at this stage... if i had to decide which game i had to play, i would choose pcars2 above AMS2 right now, because there are RX Roadcars/tracks in pcars2 (lucky that this content is also on the road map from Reiza) and pcars2 don't has this strange Tree's that destroys my immersion and this is a really big deal in a few Maps.

I will change my Review when Reiza improve AMS2, i still don't regret buying the full package, but only because i still want to support the development and there are no other good VR Racing Sim Titels.

12/03/2022 EDIT: Just bought this again after not enjoying it last time. The cars I tried today felt a lot better, and the tracks are really nice.

Im sure ill be keeping it this time, no refund.

Graphics are great, runs amazingly well compared to something like RF2. And a massive selection of really cool cars. 

Changing my review to a Thumbs Up, Just hope they keep plugging away and making more improvements.

I'm gonna leave the old review below.

OG REVIEW

I drove AMS1 for years, GSCE before that. Loved it. AMS2 is not those titles, or anywhere near them at this point in time.

This is the first title i have ever refunded.

The FFB isnt great, its not terrible either, its just there kind of. But the braking feels all kinds of wrong. I never felt like i was truly in control of the car. I tried about a dozen cars, maybe 2 of those felt ok, the rest felt terrible compared to other racing sims.

ill maybe pick this up again in the future, but ill be doing a ton more research before i do.

Its just not ready, needs so much more work.

these guys where lauded as physics geniuses for their previous titles, im now wondering how much of their genius was really the underlying engine they build their games on. Because with this engine, its really disappointing",1609704207,1647045225,True,0,0,0.527445971965789795,2,True,False,False

I played F1 2020 & 2021 alot over the year, and had fun with the game. Wanted VR which those games dont have. Searched for newer racing sims, and found this.

The first time you drive in an F3 Dallara car with a headset, wheel, and pedals... you'll be hooked.  I often have guest try out the setup, and they are all blown away.  Running older 1080 Ti and Windows Mixed Reality Acer unit.

Force feedback is better than F1 2020/21. Obviously subjective, this seems more configurable. All of the time spent in the game has been in open wheel, so can speak for non formula cars.

-Great visuals
-Great optimization (from my unprofessional experience)
-A must for VR racers. AUTO HEADSET POSITION RESET IS AWESOME WHEN SHOWING GUESTS!!!! Icons on the screen can be selected from holding head still.  
-Ran physics are awesome
-Play the Dayton track in a formula car for guests, and watch them lean in the bank.
-Easy rig setup.
-Alot of content.

Reiza are continuously working on it, publishing updates on a very frequent basis, often a couple of times each month. 

It has an excellent and diverse selection of tracks and vehicles. Significant improvements to the physics mean more and more of the vehicles feel great to drive although some are still underwhelming. The FFB is superb and incredibly detailed - it really feels like rubber on tarmac more than any other sim, particularly using the custom FFB files available on their forum. Cars sounds are generally good, some are very good.

The beautiful visuals, with full day-night cycle and dynamic weather, are enhanced with seasonal variations in foliage and atmosphere (in winter, the bare trees, sun low in the sky, light mist on the ground, frost on the distant hills, etc, all really adds mood). 

You can create your own customised championships with whatever cars and tracks you want. 

Online is solid and it's easy to set up your own race or join another.

The AI, on the other hand, is disappointing. They run on a simplified physics model and unfortunately, it really doesn't work. They virtually never make mistakes, they rarely overtake one another and have an obvious advantage in any collisions with your car - ie. on most occasions they remain glued to the track whilst your car pings off into a spin. One of the biggest problems is with RWD cars that require a delicate touch on the throttle. Whilst you're  struggling to keep your car in a straight line when powering out of a corner, the AI  can just floor it and remain in a perfect straight line 100% of the time. They never get out of shape, even in the most tail happy of cars and it just doesn't look right. It also means in some cars, you're left for dead every corner. Reducing the AI difficulty doesn't work because it just makes them stupidly slow on corner entry whilst retaining their physics defying speed out of corners, making the racing very uneven and unsatisfying and ultimately pointless.

It's now possible to customise each AI driver (names, liveries and driver abilities), which helps a bit and they are OK to race against in some of the easier to drive classes (eg. the GTs) but  you can never really escape the feeling that it's just you racing against a bunch of bots on rails.

I really appreciate your work on this game, and it has so much potential, so please keep it up!

Here's the next update of my review:

AMS 2 gets better with every update, but there are still things IMO, that are still missing and that are getting more and more frustrating with every update that does not fix or adresses them.
The content of this game grows larger and larger, which is totally fine, but i'm starting to get a feeling, that Reiza is starting to loose sight of their goal / their Vision. I fully understand, how hard and expensive it is, with all this work and licenses and that things need time to get done and fixed, but the content, that has come out lately, is getting a bit... wild. For example, We have really popular racing classes like GT3, GT4, GTE, Gr C1 and so on. That as such is great, but it falls a bit flat, because the classes are not really filled up with enough different cars, to make races feel like anything real or give that sensation to see different cars fighting each other, like in (yeah i know, most don't like to hear it) Pcars 2, where you could choose from a good variety of GT3 or GT4 cars, so there was something for everyone and was (or is) fun, such as to race with a Porsche 911 R against an Audi R8 LMS 24h head to head on the Nordschleife, with an Acura NSX hard on your rear wings. You could create so many fun combinations, that worked surprisingly well (if you could accept the Ai and their quirks) in Pcars2, like GT3 / GT4 / TC classes, or even Gr C1 / LMP900 / GT1 and so on.
The liverys where also very believable and made well enough, even if it was a fictional livery made by SMS, but in AMS 2, the liveries, apart from the few real ones, are looking... well, a bit simple, or even unbelievable. I know, that's my personal taste, and it is okay that not everybody does care about that as much as i do, but in Pcars2, the liveries where more immersive and gave players a greater selection of liveries, which even made One-Make Races a possibility, which was great.
And that's what is kind of missing in AMS 2. The game has these great classes implemented and they certainly could help raise the popularity of this game, but since they were brought into AMS2, they're left aside in various stages of completion. There are so many things, that are still missing or are still not working right. On some cars, the internal lights on the steering wheels or even the lights on buttons and other instruments in the cockpit are not working, so you're racing in a complete dark cockpit through the night. In other cars or even the same cars, there is no indicator if the headlights are turned on, or not. Please Reiza, finish the existing classes up as good as possible, fix them. Sure, i'd absolutely agree with you, if you would release something like a GT DLC in the future, but only if the contents are in an acceptable quality. But it's not only the GT classes, that are having this problem. The Group C1 also has the same issue (yes i know the Nissan R89 is coming, which is cool), but you could make this class a piece of gold, if it would contain cars like the Jaguar XJR-9 (or 11), the popular Mazda 787B with it's screaming rotary engine or even the absolute beast, the Peugeot 905. Imagine these cars battling it out again on the legendary Le Mans Circuit.
But Group A is suffering from a severe lack of cars, too. Back then, there where some really cool cars in this class. But since months, it's only Merc against BMW. This is what i mean. If you wanna implement a new class, then please, take your time, fill it up to make it a fun class. Or release it as a DLC. But not like these half baked ideas of classes, just to say ""we have class XYZ in the game already"".
I don't wanna put custom liverys of other cars/manufacturers onto them, like putting the Audi V8 livery on the Merc as a substitute. I wanna race with or against the real Audi or the Ford Sierra. So please, focus on these classes.
The Tracks and circuits so far are pretty awesome, especially the fact, that Reiza is bringing some really legendary layouts back to life.
Only two points are remaining though. The biggest is, that some tracks, especially at night, are feeling kind of lifeless. In Pcars2 (yeah i know, beating a dead horse here), when you stood in your pit box, you could hear sounds of mechanics working, tools beeing dropped, tires beeing changed and see the fans on the grand stands, some of them waving flags, you could hear them cheer and even clapping their hands. You can see marshals and crew members standing on the pit stands or pit wall, talking into their radio sets, or talking to others directly. And when you where racing on the track, you had spectators, marshals, firemen, vehicles and other details along the track and on most circuits, tricky parts or corners would be lit up by spotlights from the trackside. When you came along the pits, grandstands or the start-/ finishline, everything was realisticly lit up, you could see the flashes of spectators taking photos etc. These little details where accumulating into an immerive atmosphere, that can really make you feel like racing in a great event that matters.
And maybe, Reiza, you'll take some inspiration from the good old Grand Prix 4, which featured really cool pit crew / pit stop animations for it's time.

So, as i've said already - AMS 2 has a lot of great potential. But potential of a product alone isn't enough. You need to work on it, polish it. I know that you're working hard on this title, but please Reiza:

Concentrate on the existing content, fill it up, structure it. In the last months, it starts to feel like you've lost the direction or any plan and AMS 2 is growing in a pretty wild way, without any concept or vision, with cars and classes popping up here and there and content is getting dribbled in with various qualities and quantities. Yeah, open wheel cars are fun, but i think AMS2 has enough already of them, you don't need to bring every single year of F1 to us.
Don't get distracted, work on AMS2 as it is now, polish it and then you can add some more contents via DLC's or otherwise. But only, if the quality and passion for making this stuff is there, otherwise, don't bother.",1619790810,1644843273,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

VR support is amazing, the force feedback on my G29 is really good, and I've set up AMS2 to show helmet view and have dialled up the settings for camera shake and G-force movement. The sense of speed when you're going all out, with all the camera wobbles and shakes, is much more immersive than I've seen with other sims and racing games. The AI is pretty good too (better than AC in my experience).

This is probably going to be my go-to sim racer from now on. Not sure about realism as I've never raced an actual F1 car before :) but compared to AC it feels less skittish - AC makes me feel like I'm driving on ice sometimes. It's just a lot of fun without feeling very arcade-y.

I picked up some great mods, and I'm hoping the mod community will blossom for AMS2.

[Edit: updated after 50 hours ...

I have to update this review. This sim is spectacular now, I think. The cars all handle differently but believably so. The multiplayer is alive at all hours, thanks to the South Americans who come online when the Europeans have gone to bed. The VR is simply fantastic - with all the menus working as they should, unlike any of the other sims, and maintaining excellent graphics without tanking my framerate. Great work and a must buy for any sim racer.]

[Edit: updated after 130 hours ...

This is now my favourite sim. The multiplayer lobbies are always busy, with 10-20 car grids regularly. Nice variety of cars/tracks too, and you can set your own up very easily if you fancy something different. The handling feels spot on to me, as does the improved FFB.

unfortunatly the handling is very floaty and its awkward to make any real connection to the car your driving.
the AI difficulty,even on the lowest setting is to aggressive and too competitive,any new comer just be aware of this as it does not do a good job of holding your hand.
graphics are about the same as AC,nothing new really that you wont have already done in the likes of AC or even project cars for that matter. 
unless you are one of these sim youtube streamers with lots of time on your hands to learn the handling,stay well away from this title.my 11 hours on it says everything.

just to add further after winning races or atleast top 3.there nothing as a reward no podium,nothing to be rewarded with.just the cool down lap and the straight to the next race,its not enough to merit a win.

The graphics are excellent, the physics engine too, with a clear accent in the feeling of weight transfer from back to front when the car brakes or accelerates, with severe, very appreciable consequences on the playability. Wonderful the tyre simulation and deforming. I have not played versions before 1.3, having bought the game after the major update, but the driving feel is fantastic. The sound is some rarely heard, top notch as for ACC, especially I love the sound produced by the tyres friction with asphalt, it is very interactive and gives incredible informations about the terrain if you play with headphones. As for the force feedback, the default and default+ are a bit insufficient, but using a custom one (there are ones also on the official forum) and copying it in the game document folder gives enormous enhanchments.
Always for the Force Feedback, a thing I must report, is a bug with my old wheel, starting a race (practice, qualify or race) often the FFB is not active (only gain, no effects), and to activate it one must hit alt-tab / alt-tab for a few times until it resets, risking to go hitting the walls or other cars in the game, especially in multiplayer where one can't pause the game. I would suggest to insert in the key binding an entry for FFB reset, as occours for RFactor 2. I shall report this bug in the game forums with more details on my config. 
Another wonderful thing of this game are the built in-car visuals, very accurate and very realistic the oscillations and head bobbing, more than that of ACC, which I think it needs improvement in this only sector.
The key bindings in generale are more ordinate, memorizable  and less complicated than that of ACC. Finally, playing with an XBox controller is very easy to configure and pretty accurate in game performance compared to other sims, optimal vibration/ffb too.
Two Thumbs Up.

EDIT: another great thing of this game is if you do not find in multiplayer a lobby that meets  your expectations, you can simply create one and host a session! I just created an Interlagos 1976 session with varialble weather and after 5 minutes 3 or 4 peoples joined freely (no need for invitation!) and we played together in few minutes.

However, Reiza has implemented it WAY better. There is a lot to love about this game, and there are several draw backs.

Pros:
- Easily the best looking sim on the market. Day, night, and weather transitions are second to none.
- You get a lot of content not seen on other games.
- The force feedback feels really good

Neutral:
- In my opinion, the physics are not 100% there yet. It still has some quirky issues, much like PC2. 
- In addition to the prior point, some cars feel very refined and some do not. You can tell which cars are newer.
- Cars seem to be bouncer than they should be.
- The AI are SOOOOO much better than it was at release. They AI are fun in most situations. But there are a few scenarios where if you put the AI in a certain car on a certain track, in a certain condition, they are either ungodly fast or ungodly slow. I like the do races with weather transitions and sometimes they are just so bad or good it takes the fun out of it. Generally, AI in the dry is good.

Cons:
- There is generally nobody online. And if there is, they are racing GT3, in which case I will just go play ACC.

Acting almost like a stand-alone expansion to Project CARS 2, the game makes use of the Madness Engine while focusing heavily on racing series based in South America. Much of the car and track list will be completely unfamiliar territory to all but the most dedicated of sim racers, which may be off-putting. The content selection is rounded out with a mix of unlicensed Formula One machinery and whatever other past & present licenses Reiza could get their hands on, but it's all stuff you've seen before in other sims, and a suspicious amount of Reiza's pricey DLC plan features asset flips that were very obviously given to them from Slightly Mad Studios. In short, they are re-selling you content you've likely already paid for in another sim on the same engine that wasn't released all that long ago.

Running on the same engine that powers Project CARS 2, very little has actually been changed from the Slightly Mad Studios title - warts and all. There was hope that Reiza's live service approach would polish some of the issues that popped up in pCars 2, but that obviously didn't happen. AI are wildly inconsistent, some tracks have outright broken lighting, and small GUI quirks such as menu options missing names or not detecting the mouse when you scroll over it are just some of the weird problems you'll run into. In online races I've discovered AI bots populating the server were floating off the ground and missing wheels, which is a bug that for any other game would go viral on YouTube.

I'd like to say that this is all tolerable thanks to the game's fundamentally sound driving physics, but it's really no better than Project CARS 2. Some cars such as the Cadillac Daytona Prototype are really good, others such as the GX390 kart have terrible default setups and just don't drive anywhere near what they're supposed to.

The end product is a niche title I can only recommend to the most hardcore of sim racers, and even they don't seem to be all that excited about the game as online is typically a ghost town.",1641550478,1641550478,False,14,5,0.500445783138275146,0,True,False,False

Lift off and it turns in, then back on the pedal and it sounds amazing. The driving experience in ACC str8 up feels dead in comparison.

I didn't have to configure anything, it just worked right out of the box with no tweaking to my G29 wheel needed. I can get into a practice session or a full race straight away against AI (not really interested in Multiplayer as I'm still a newbie driver). There was actually a good main menu here unlike AC.

The game looks great and is optimized REALLY well. It seems very polished, and sounds breathtaking. The engine sounds going from this to Forza Horizon 4 made me go WTF. It's like hearing a gun sound irl vs firing a BB Gun, that's how big the difference was, though I still enjoy FH4 very much for its casual bliss-ness and its high production values.

Coming from Project Cars 2 and having avoided the disappointing Project Cars 3, this game feels exactly like what the former titles should have been. The sounds, input, and physics are so much better. -With much more detail in each category. This game is also way better optimized and has much less glitches than PC2.

My wish is for more international maps (as this dev focused much more on Brazilian tracks). My friends and I got this for F1 (Formula Ultimate in this), and ideally I wish there were more maps such as Baku, Marina Bay, Shanghai, Istanbul Park, Barcelona etc. As well as a way we can have a tournament with a set amount of tracks and points.

buyer, make no mistake. this absolutely is an EARLY ACCESS game, and one you're being repeatedly charged for.

now don't get me wrong, whatever works here, works fabulously. the performance is fantastic, vr is superb, and the quick-fire all-inclusive racing is just stupidly good.

it shares engine with project cars 2 and where project cars 2 feels a bit inconsistent in quality, this game ranges from beating it left-handedly to downright fubar-level trash.

the ai is hit or miss, and in a full-on amateur-hour way. it is e.g. not unusual that with random weather, they pit on the opening lap. come on, geoff crammond's f1gp had this down.

the car models are even worse. where some are near damn immaculate, majority of the metalmoro prototype cockpits are a catastrophic mess. there are some strange 'polygonal artifacts' in vr in many of other cockpits. the puma gt4 looks even worse than the metalmoros and drives like a bus. the classic mini understeers at 1/100th throttle (i drive one of those irl btw). the latest cadillac prototype's behaviour is utterly bizzare too, and that is paid dlc afaik. there are also inaccuracies and/or typos in the cars' stats screens.

what's good here is very very good and a ton of fun for hours on end. but the ever-present reminder that you are playing an early access title (and paid and pre-paid a ton of money for it too!) almost manages to ruin it completely.",1640778806,1640778806,False,4,2,0.489874720573425293,0,True,False,False

Would I recommend it....

On the plus side:
Graphics are nice
THE best weather & night cycle around
Car and track selection are good
Regular updates

Negatives:
AI are murderous bastards
Cars do NOT handle right - despite what many people will say - it is still a simcade
UI is a bit inconsistent 
Still quite a lot of bugs
You will probably need a custom FFB file to make the wheel feel correct.

So - no not recommended - but I hope to keep visiting it every now and again and I hope they get it all sorted out, because if they do it will be one hell of a sim.

[EDITED REVIEW, 26-DEC-2021]

OK, since the 1.3 update the cars feel soo much better, it actually feels connected to the road.

That, with a decent custom FFB file (currently rocking rFuktor 5.0.4), it is excellent. 

There's still some work to do, the graphics need some tone adjustment to be less cartoony, the AI needs work, and the tyres probably need sorting out.

BUT, I look forward to turning it on now, and Reiza seem completely dedicated to getting it working correctly.

I jut have to change my review from not recommended to recommended.

AMS2 uses Project Cars' Madness engine, which allows for significantly improved visuals when compared to AMS1. AMS2 looks beautiful, with the improved lighting and effects really bringing each car to life. The physics are not quite to AMS1 standards yet, but Reiza has been steadily improving them in game updates, and the cars already feel fantastic regardless. Speaking of updates, Reiza is very generous with them. While some content is provided in paid DLC form, Reiza routinely includes fully-featured cars and tracks in updates, completely free for all users. Seeing them expand the car and track selection for free while other sims require you to spend hundreds of dollars to get all of their content is a very nice change, especially when considering the already impressive car selection.

The car and track selection is somewhat unusual for racing sims, which is part of why I like it. It's all well and good to drive a Ferrari around Nurburgring for the 400th time, but AMS2 focuses heavily on lesser-known cars and tracks. It still does have Nurburgring (of course) but the car and track selection heavily favors Brazilian series, which is an endearing change for someone used to games with a laser-focus on American and European racing. AMS2 also has some lesser-known vehicles from other parts of the world, such as the Aussie Racing Car series, driving Camaro silhouettes on a motorcycle-engined chassis.

All in all, AMS2 is a very well-rounded sim which will bring some much-needed variety to any simracing enthusiast's library. If you're getting tired of the same old races in the same old cars, give AMS2 a try. Its unique car and track selection and excellent post-release support make it a great choice.",1640361986,1640361986,True,2,0,0.537899553775787354,0,True,False,False

My last purchase was AMS2 after following the YT channel of Herr Löblich. My interests lie in having fun but with a more simulation like approach. So I emphasize on GFX, SFX and FFB rather the best tyre modell or the best pit stop strategy. And here AMS2 wins in many categories or goes equal with my two favourites, ACC and R3E. GFX is outstanding, coming from PCars2s engine, with sharp images and color fidelity. The sound is also on par, but it is a little bit too clean for my taste - ACC and R3E have a more dirty feeling with more details (i.e. stones in the chassis or structure movement etc). Where AMS2 is unbeatable at the moment is the FFB (after V1.3 update there is a lot of additional details in the wheel) and the seasonal atmosphere on the track. Nothing compares to a spring race on the Nordschleife in the dawn with blossoms on the bushes or a cold winter track with leafless trees.

The list of content coming in 2022 for the season pass is incredible. Classic Nurburgring? No other developer would even consider that. The latest changes include things people have been asking about for years with the Madness Engine and Reiza is doing a great job of implementing them.

The default content has lots of hidden gems that you might not have experienced yet in other sims. The circuit in Ecuador is great (as are plenty of the Brazilian tracks), take the M1 Procar there around sunset.

The season pass is the way to go though. The 90's layouts of Monza and Spa are fantastic. Not to mention CART, which turned out to be better than anyone imagined. Who cares that they never raced on the Nurburgring irl, take them on the Nordschliefe!

Fixes to limited slip diff and tires in 1.3 made a huge difference to the simulation. For me weight transfer effects are now enough to match my expectation based on other sims and real life (spirited street driving, hooning in the snow and karting) experience. On top of that you get unprecedented very interesting number of cars, tracks, plus FFB and tire physics that give you the best impression of real life dynamysm of a car

A great set of cars, unmatched FFB, great VR perfomance even on older systems, but core physics problem.
Not going into details, car feel is better than in any existing racing title. But lack of longitudinal weight transfer effects that should be present when trailbraking, lift off or applying throttle make driving considerably differ from other sims and, as far as I can judge, from real life.

Reiza have been great with the development of this game being very transparent with people playing the game and constantly improving the game. The force feedback (and the game isnt awful on a controller meaning it is much more accessible for your noob friends)  is amazing giving lots of information, the physics (while not perfect by any means) are very fun and immersive to drive and there is a range of cars (from f1 cars to copa montanas) and tracks (from bathurst to the nordshlife).
As well as this one very big overlooked benefit to this game is the multiplayer (with friends if you try anything else expect gt3 cars at spa with around 12 people in it).

One note, I've never played the original AMS, so I won't make any comparisons to it. I have however, played well over 100 hours of Project Cars 2, and it was one of the sims responsible for getting me into sim racing. It was realistic enough to be a challenge, with enough options to make it a light and fun experience. 

This is the true spiritual successor to PCars2. It takes everything from that game, including the Madness Engine, and dials it in a couple extra notches. Especially the FFB, which was the major weakpoint of PCars2. In this there seems to be a lot more detail, and I don't find myself wondering what the cars are doing anywhere near as much. 

It's obviously a different game from PCars2 in a lot of ways though. For one, there are no rallycross cars or courses (although there is some offroad/dirt content planned for some point in the future). This isn't a huge deal as there is still a ton of variety and fun to be had.

Long story short, I wholeheartedly recommend this sim. It has a fantastic amount of features and polish as a standalone sim, the physics and ffb feel great, etc. And on top of that, if you were as disappointed with PCars3 as I was, this is the sim you want to play. It's got almost everything PCars2 has, and it builds on most of them to make the ultimate, accessible sim racing experience.",1638639840,1638639840,True,25,0,0.695412874221801758,0,True,False,False

-
They have now added 1990's era Indycars and several new USA tracks!! 
If you buy this game now, you will end up removing all of your other racing sims..
It's THAT GOOD!  
-_ I just wanted to add that lol.

Following is my original review from Summer of 2021

You MUST try this game. I cannot overstate this.. I'm starting with that, because I really think (if you came here to check it out), you won't be disappointed. You have nothing to lose. Give it a 2 hour try. You won't return it.
I know that there are many opinions about this game. I've heard about low numbers in multiplayer, the game is still in development, etc.. Sure, Reiza is still updating and improving this game. Bugs still exist.. fine.. 
But.. if you enjoy racing simulators, are tired of having to mod the heck out of AC just to get it to look like there is weather, if you want more than the same F1 20xx year after year, if you want a racing simulator that has just about every type of vehicle, from all different racing era's (1960s to modern), you owe it to yourself to give this a try.
The variety of race vehicles is mind boggling. And every vehicle has its own sound, its own feel. Try a kart similar to what you will find at your local kart racing track.. the sound of the 2 cycle engine, the incredibly frustrating time delay to get it up to speed, it is all very realistic.. 
Cars:
The Formula 1 cars, from the 1960s era, into the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and modern ... it is crazy.. These are NOT just vehicles painted to look like they belong in a particular era. They sound and feel like you are in a real Formula 1 car from that era. Each one is unique, from the impossible to control 60s lightweight cars, to the whining engines of the 70s, to the turbos of the 80s, and into the modern cars.. each era, and each car, has its own feel and sound. They did not copy / paste these.
The GT series cars.. I can't even begin to describe how good these are.. if you're into modern GT racing, you have everything, GT3, GT4, GTE, ... take the Corvette out for a spin.. you will not believe the sound... 
I have never driven a real race car, only sims.. but the feeling of one of these when turning a corner, pushing the limit of slip... it just feels right, 
The ""alternative"" cars... there is so much here.. just so much.. from the 1970s era stock cars such as Opala, Chevette, .. just really cool cars that were raced in real life on local tracks in Brazil and South America. This is a world those of us in North America and the rest of the world seem to have missed.. it is a very dedicated racing community down there.. and AMS2 represents it well.
The tracks.. every track is .. simply better than what you will see in any other sim.. there are many historical tracks, which (based on the scenery) really make you FEEL like you are back in time.. no safer barriers, sometimes no walls lol.. everything along the track looks like the era you are in... 
The weather... you MUST try this game if not only for the weather. Real weather updates, or make your own. The way the weather progresses, the way the water on the track affects your car, how this all looks... no way to describe it.. try it... 
There is no way to describe, the sun setting in the west, when the rain stops, and the track is still partially wet, but the glimmer and reflection on the small patches of water on the tracks.. and as day turns from day to late afternoon... the shadows... darker in some spots... sun on the horizon.. simply beautiful.
The AI..
In my opinion, the AI is some of the best out there. They will fight you for position, not just go to sleep, but will race you fair. If you have a position going into a turn, they will typically back off.. but they will continue to push you.. again.. again.. they don't just give up.. so you will have your hands full for an entire race.
You can pit and let your teammate take over.. he/she will drive until you want them to come back in. 
So.. I saved the bad parts for the end, but these should not prevent you from trying this game!
Multiplayer: Still a lower player count. You can find, at any time, about 25 to 50 players online.. perhaps 1 or 2 races which have 10 players.. these numbers are increasing weekly. (I am an offline player so I don't care about these things).
Championship bugs. They offer a custom championship mode for offline players like me. It still has bugs (refueling not allowed, points not assigned correctly), but Reiza has been phenomenal in there diligence to fix issues, so there is no doubt in my mind that these will be fixed.
If you want a game that you don't have to do ANY mods to make it work, give this a try.",1623629696,1638581050,True,38,1,0.726386427879333496,0,True,False,False

I use the word feel in particular because obviously we as sim racers do not get that seat of the pants feel of being in a real car so we look for the closest possible thing to the real thing. I have been a member of iracing for going on 10 years now but I will admit the physics of that game just don't live up to the level of handling of this or even other sims on the market. If one day the online of automobilista could match the level of online on iracing, at least in terms of numbers of players and how it's formatted, I think you would have the perfect sim in automobilista 2.

It now has excellent FFB and car feel, a very large selection of content and it just works - unlike others such as AC which requires headset on and off and constant tweaking and updating. 

Maybe not all things to all people - I use it for casual, impromtu sessions and short on time fun, but still have iRacing for more serious online competition when I can devote a few focused hours a week to practice and racing.

There is a good selection of often overlooked tracks from the southern hemisphere often passed over in northern hemisphere sourced titles.  The UI is decent, very easy to manage. The game was designed to work well with the G29 wheel, so you don't need to break the bank to enjoy it.

The BAD: Game is not fully implemented yet, some of the features and driving models are of an inconsistent or poor quality, including the FFB which on some cars feels relatively numb.  Not all of the tracks behave with the same fidelity.  And the AI often appears to either be cheating or ignoring the physics that players use.  The game won't recognize my shifter, and TrackIR is a pita to get working. 

The UGLY:  This part is apparently subjective, but I only bought it to drive the lotus 49 car (formula vintage gen 1/2), which (with the exception of a couple tracks) handles like it has wheels made of frozen dog crap skating on an ice rink.  Unplayable understeer doesn't even begin to describe it.  You have to intentionally unsettle the car to attempt to ""oversteer"" it to make sharp corners even at the slowest speeds on maps like Curvelo, which means a whole lot of sliding around, missed apexes and getting your ass handed to you by the AI which seems to be operating according to different physics.  That you have to intentionally unsettle the car in order to make basic turns seems fake af, in addition to creating some very bad driving habits.  Apparently some people are saying this is ""realistic"" but if it is, it seems exaggerated to say the least.  Pretty much every other top ranked realistic racing sim out there does the lotus 49 better than this game.  Such a disappointment as I love this car in every other sim out there.  Again this is just subjective, if you don't care about the lotus 49, then this probably won't bother you unless your favorite car is similarly affected by what I am assuming is a bad tire model.  Thankfully, the Formula Classic cars have no such issues and that is my 2nd favorite car so the game wasn't a total bust.

UPDATE (11-17-20):  The Lotus 49 has been patched, and after testing it out for several hours I have come to the admittedly shocked conclusion that AMS2 has gone from the worst model of the Lotus 49 to the BEST model of the Lotus 49 in sim racing.  The over and under steer has been dialed in to give a very responsive drive, the Force Feedback is simply outstanding making me completely aware of everything that is happening, and the grip of the tires now feels like a earlier less-grippy version of the very grippy Lotus 79, instead of the previous ice skating version.   You can now easily corner at the edge of the envelope and know exactly where that is.   I would go so far as to say that this is the best physics model to date in any racing sim.  The only slight criticisms I can say is that you need to dial in the steering ratios by artificially curtailing your total wheel rotation so that it matches the in game rotation of whatever car you're driving, and also trail-breaking doesn't seem to be completely necessary as it is in iRacing, but that might be down to iRacing now having a generally more floaty and less forgiving tire model (which many real life racers say is unrealistic).

UPDATE: (6/20/21)  They Lotus 49C is busted again with the latest updates.  Making even the most basic turn requires torquing the engine at high RPMs to rotate the car, or slamming on the brakes and making the turn at a crawl.  It's as bad as it was at release.  Massive understeer!  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the game in it's current state atm.  Hopefully this will change, as the game is getting regular updates.

UPDATE: (11/29/21): quite the roller coaster, but the latest patch seems to have fixed some core issues with the physics model across the board.  A couple cars still have some issues, or so I hear, but all of my favorites including the lotus 49C are working very well again.  I can do subtle lift off over steer, and I can throw the wheel into the turns and use the acceleration and brakes to balance the wheel traction FINALLY.  I really hope it stays fixed this time cause it's running great now, it's beautiful to look at, and has one of the best physics models out there atm.",1589501487,1638248300,True,0,0,0.670535385608673096,0,True,False,False

Also, like Project Cars 2 (again same engine), best VR experience I've found for racing.

What's more is the custom championship feature which allows you to set up whatever selection of tracks you want and set specific conditions for each track allowing for very accurate classic race recreations.

1.) The developers are amazing. Even though it is a small studio as compared to some other big ones out there, but these guys know how to get things done. These guys actually listen to the community. New content and features are still being added for free, a year later since the release.

2.) Initially, the physics was a little bit off, but after 10-12 revisions (with the monthly updates), it has improved to an extent where driving these cars just feels natural. I am not exaggerating but I've genuinely never felt such a close connection with the car in a simulator, and I've played almost every commercial level sim out there. I know what the wheels are doing exactly at a given moment, I can predict some things even before they happen. I can sense when the car runs hot, I can feel the cold tyres struggling to grip, I can feel the rear tyres struggle as soon as I put the throttle down. It is amazing!

3.) The sounds are in a league of their own. The engines sounds never get boring. You can hear the grass and marbles hitting the chassis. Stress the car hard enough and at times you can feel the chassis flex. It is really immersive.

4.) Decent amount of vehicles to choose from. Personally, I enjoy having quality over quantity and this is one of the reasons why I never could get into PC2. In AMS2, you don't have as many cars as you did in PC2, but whatever we have in here, screams quality. No two cars sound the same, no 2 cars behave the same, ever car has its own quirks.

5.) The tracks in AMS2 (particuarly the ones being sold as the DLC) are straight up beautiful. The scenery looks way too realistic, and just like in PC2, it changes depending upon the season. There are several different historical layouts to choose from and each of those layouts have been recreated very faithfully (with appropriate billboards/sponsors/poster). With Live Track 3.0, tracks evolve in real time as you progress through time, and it works far better here than it ever did in PC2.

6.) Madness Engine is running at its best in AMS2. It runs super smooth, on my GTX960M, which I am very grateful for! It looks amazing, probably the best looking sim out there (at times even better than PC2). Features like Real Weather and Historical Weather are game changers and I don't think that I'll look at any other sim in the same way as I do AMS2 because of these 2 features in particular.

7.) The AI is some of the best that I've seen yet in a racing sim, definitely up there with F1 2020 and ACC. It is a challenge to set it up right, because you'd have to play with the numbers a lot initially but once you get it down, it is a blast!

To sum it up, AMS2 takes all the good stuff that PC2 had (Live Track, Madness Engine, Weather Effects) and pairs it all with superior physics, quality content, and impressive new features.

even tho, in mean time i Played AMS1, so it feels like AMS1 is far more superior in physics and better AI in my opinion. but Reiza still learning ""Madnes engine"" it is new for Reiza to get things right and learn how it all works, but i am glad Reiza keeping to improve the game of AMS2. for all we know, AMS2 might get the physics again as we love from AMS1, i keep that in a slightly hope. 

but AMS2 will grow more and more as much more they keep updating it. i recomend the sim with half prize not full prize. because it is still unfinished game and still growing. but that is up to you to decide to buy full or half price when sales are here.

I was playing it with an XBOX ONE S controller and had to enable automated driving and braking assist to make it playable. Don't know what's up but the cars like to slip and slide. I will update my review after testing it with my VR headset and MOMO Force wheel. 

The graphics are really nice but I need to really test things out first. I'll recommend it based on initial presentation but I have yet to really take it for a spin.

############ UPDATE ############ 

It's a night and day difference playing with a MOMO Force wheel and the HP Reverb G2! The cars look great inside and out. The vehicles are extremely responsive at the slightest touch of the wheel. I highly recommend this title if you have a similar setup, playing with a handheld controller simply won't cut it.

You get the sense of speed and immersion in VR. There simply is no better way to play. I like this as much as Project Cars 1 & 2 and maybe a bit more.

TLDR: I thoroughly enjoyed lapping the Nordschleife for the last 30 minutes after struggling for hours to get my Wheel and Pedals to work properly.  The felt elevation changes and the FFB are a pleasant experience.  


UPDATED REVIEW:
I have been iRacing for a few years and never considered branching out to other platforms but after seeing reviews of respected YouTube SIM racers I decided to pick up the big 5: (Race Room, RFactor2, Assetto Corsa, ACC, and Automobilista 2).  The drive to pickup AMS2 was largely due to the Nordschleife.  I must say what an awesome experience.  I'm definitely going to put laps on other circuits now that I've felt the FFB and while it took me a while to dial everything in to my liking, I can see myself getting lost for hours. Consider this my First Impressions based on the Porsche GT3 R and Nordschleife:

PROS:
- Weather is by far the best I've seen in ANY game/SIM.  Just incredible!
- Default setup for Porsche GT3 R handles great, very forgiving and doesn't feel as easy to lose control like other SIMs.
- Sounds are not bad at all, Engine, Car suspension, brakes and tires come through nicely
- Huge Sale right now!!  Get it while it's hot
- A fair amount of tracks and cars with base game
- Car to Track ratio feels great (Size of car compared to track width). 
- Gorgeous Track, graphics are as good as ACC in my opinion on my system. 
     i7@4.25 GHz
    32GB DDR4 @ 32000 mHz
    3080 Super 8GB
    Triples: Dell - S2721HGF 27"" Gaming - LED Curved Monitor


CONS: 
- Hardware issue from the start, and from googleing looks like I'm not alone with AMS2 having issues recognizing Hardware.  Glad I pushed through and got it resolved though!
- For people super serious about car handling, this feels much more forgiving and somewhat ""SIMcadey"", but for me I'm not personally put off by it.  
- Multiplayer for public sessions seems to be hit or miss and that's also from research prior to buying.  Leagues however are great for AMS2 and I will be on the lookout for one that works with my schedule (hopefully)
- AI is not the best compared to other SIM Racing titles. It's there, but it or miss.


ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Score: 2/10 .... Unplayable. 
Absolutely a waste of money at the moment. I own every major racing SIM title and this is the ONLY one that does not recognize my hardware correctly.  I've spent the last 4 hours on forums, reddit, and unofficial AMB2 Discord with ZER0 luck.  iRacing, RF2, ACC, AC, RR, etc. all work just fine with my wheel and pedals.  (thrustmaster TS with Ferrari F1 Rim and Fanatec CS3.0 Pedals).  


RESOLUTION to my Hardware Issue:
Here's what seemed to resolve my issue:
1) Make sure AMS2 is Closed
2) Delete the  default.controllersettings.v1.03.sav
3) Restart System
4) When logging back in, make sure no addons like Crew Chief, iFlag, Trading Paints, SIM Dashboard or SimHub are running. 
5) Start AMS2
6) Leaving the Preselected Thrustmaster Base and Separate Pedal profile worked for me
7) Assign buttons how you prefer
8) Calibrate Steering and Pedals",1635563156,1635568405,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Good tire model that really relies on a good setup rather than aiming to hit a certain pressure, good handling characteristics that rely on your ability to set up the car, great tuning options, lots of tracks, lots of cars. It handles well, and the rFuktor FFB addon is mandatory and fantastic. Probably the best feel I've gotten from any race sim.

I messed around with AMS2 when it first came out, and it felt uncomplete to me, kind of like it was missing a lot of stuff. I fiddled around with various cars at various tracks, particularly the BMW Procar at Suzuka. But it felt off, and I simply waited for the updates to settle down a bit. Then 1.2 came out recently so I got back into it. Imagine my surprise when I spent the next 6 hours fiddling around with the Procar and the 2020 Brazil Stock Car and had an absolute blast. The tweaking of parameters is so much more intuitive and responsive than in other games, and can make an awful beast turn into a docile and fast race car. I've had a lot of fun so far and I think the game is finally in a state to recommend.

The game is very setup-dependent. You NEED to tweak the cars a bit in order to get them just right and fun to drive. But it doesn't take long! Maybe 30 minutes of practice at most. There's a great series by Steelcast/Steelreserve on Youtube and it's also linked in the Guides section on Steam. Highly recommend that too.

The devs have... not exactly grand plans for the sim? They're keeping things out to a reasonable 1-2 year time frame and seeing what works. It's still changed greatly since I got the game in the post-1.x era. I still love taking a BMW Procar and chucking it around Suzuka, or throwing a Chevy Chevette around Monaco, or seeing how some awful go-kart does around the Nurburgring. It's a lot of fun, and that's what we're missing from sim-racing these days. It's about fun.

And if it isn't fun, why bother?

Great game and sim. Heartily recommend especially since it's come such a long way in the last year. Support small devs!",1624073514,1635196964,True,14,1,0.651057422161102295,4,True,False,False

When it came out of 'early access' it was still very much NOT ready for release. So many game-breaking bugs, incomplete basic interface and gameplay elements, very patchy car models, etc, the list of issues for a full release game was just inexcusable.
The developers have continued work on it. They have tweaked, adjusted and put more effort in to the main interface menu & added content regularly. Some of the more annoying issues are still present, with multiplayer lobbies being very buggy and failing to work at all sometimes, the same issues were in PC2 so may be a fundamental issue with the engine which would not be an easy fix if even possible.
If you like single-player racing against bots it is now at a stage where it is decent and enjoyable. If you like online races in public lobbies, then it is still very hard to find a decent race lobby that has actual people in it and that does not require the additional DLC tracks which are overpriced.
Expect to spend a great deal of time trying to get an enjoyable online race completed.
** update following recent patches Oct 21: The car handling and tyre model seem a lot better now, it is possible to recover loss of traction without automatically spearing off into the barriers, it is no longer a irreversible situation & feels a lot more natural. 
AI is even more savage, depending on the track they will often just brutally punt you from the rear in the braking zone and spin you out, or violently swerve back into your path right at the start of the braking zone. On some tracks they behave far more realistically and provide a decent race.
I would recommend VR users to try this, it looks great and performs really well and nothing beats a mixed class VR race around somewhere like Spa, with the light beams breaking through the trees and haze around the track.",1609610773,1635096020,False,2,0,0.502923786640167236,0,True,False,False

This has been a great shame as the content looks to be some of the best in sim racing.
While little effort has been make from Reiza to make gamepad better continual improvements to the physics have improved the overall experience. 

Most recently an improvement to throttle response on all cars has fixed the worst aspect of driving on gamepad. Previously even with traction control on it was impossible to exit the corners without flailing around widly. I use the triggers for brake and throttle so maybe right stick users were already ok with putting the power down. But since this update I now have enough control to just lean on the TC a bit while exiting. Any small steering inputs no longer send the car off circuit. I can finally enjoy AMS2 content and its great.

I will still add the disclaimer that this isn't the best gamepad support out there but if you're able to be careful with your inputs the game is worth looking at now.

It is the best and most fun Single player racing experience.  
Its more really good fun sim than ultra hardcore end, probably what Project Cars 3 should of been similar too not what it ended up being, as AMS2 uses same engine.

I have been modding rfactor2 and AC for years to try and get it to do some of the things AMS2 does right out of the box.

rFactor 2 has a great wet/dry line weather system. But it looks awful jagged lines box puddles etc. AMS2 does this alot better and it looks phenomenal. They are adding dynamic weather and historic weather data, but right now you can still set a historic date and random weather and it will be relevant to the time/date 

What impressed me the most was set a date in March and the trees at Hockenheim are all bear and winter,  where are lush green in the summer.

Its the little things in AMS2 that really works, and you can tell alot of effort - its made by Sim Racers, for Sim Racers. 

The AI is the best ive ever seen in any game / sim.   Although the new AI on iRacing comes close/ 

The Historic tracks are by far the best coupled with everything else, the weather etc 

Sure i can mod 1988 F1 cars / WEC into rfactor2 and run a championship.   But its third party mods, some tracks are rfactor 1 imports DX9 so dont look great.     

Where as AMS 2 it has all this historic content out of hte box, including layouts such as Spa 1993,  Hockenheim 1988, Montreal 1988, Interlagos 1986, Nordschleife.


Multiplayer i think is options, but other sims you will find races much more easier

Really impressed with what it can do with minimal effort.    

Missing ability to change AI driver names,  but you can mod in car for recreating the correct 88 grid etc just have to put up with Claudio Lopez instead of Ayrton Senna 

8/10   - Still improving all the time and its in early days.  But so impressed i had to come here to write a review about it.

The most fun and easy to use right out of the box single player SIM experience on PC currently.  Needs more of a multiplayer following but i think has a bright future.

As an example I've probably just had my best experience in sim racing - an autumn GT3 race at Virginia Raceway in a McLaren 720S with three random weather slots - it started in monsoon conditions with almost zero visibility and low grip, then the skies cleared and the sun came out and I had a drying track with evolving lines, it looked and felt absolutely incredible with the golden hour light and autumn colours. The realistic foliage and light effects add something no other sim can do out of the box - I have a fairly modest graphics card (GTX 1060 6GB) and the game ran this scenario smoothly. The AI was also hard but fair to race against on this occasion (100% difficulty and 60% aggression) and I can't recommend trying that experience enough. 

I've also done a comparison of the Mercedes GT3 car in this and RaceRoom (ADAC GT Masters 2020 version) 
 at Bathurst, there isn't that much difference in the handling (RRRE has better force feedback) and I managed to set a laptime within 1/10 sec of each other, just quicker in AMS2. You couldn't ask for much more. 

The Brazilian stock cars and Brazilian circuits are also a lot of fun in this sim and again look incredible. 

The thing I really want to see improve is the racecraft of the AI, it's getting there but sometimes there are some weird jinks by AI cars and I'd like to see them defend their positions. It can feel like they don't recognise you're there at times but otherwise this game has made great progress and I can now recommend it.",1631475398,1631475398,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can have fun with this, it can be very immersive, but if you dont own it yet, (or are one of those people who loved PC2 and like obscure racing content) youre probrably better off buying Assetto Corsa. 

- Has the same issues that PC2 had (imo). Cars feel floaty, understeer until they snap into oversteer under braking.
I have to significantly lower my brake sensitivity + lower the braking pressure in every setup, to have somewhat of a reliable and understandable behaviour. Considering the Game resets every setting every patch, this is almost as tiresome to set up as rFactor with similar bad UI. 
- Online is an almost non-existent public lobby b*llshit, so no alternative to ACC or iRacing.
- Offline content is promising, but very unfinished overall. AI is hit and miss.
- I dont quite understand the way they sell this. The basecontent is recycled from the (excellent) first game, just in a very mediocre engine. The ""season pass"" with the big price tag is mostly content that already exists in other sims, just in an not ideal engine. Considering the wide range of content, everything just feels ""okay"", since there isnt really focus on specific things. The GTE's are quite fun, apart from the horrendous revlimiter sound that plagues a lot of cars. but thats just another, unfinished part of this game.

A game with a new ""more sim"" core, with the yet best graphic engine around. They just removed all Project CARS 2 car physics, trashed them, and made those cars drive, handle and move just like rFactor 2. You feel the car weight and inertia now. The steering wheel and force feedback finally work helping the driver to understand what is happening in the game.

But, even with the SMS' Madness Engine, this is not Project CARS 2 Unlimited, or Sport or Competition: This is the next chapter in Automobilista.

The game is still under ""heavy"" development. Things are placed here and there mostly like bookmarks. The GT3 is far away from complete, and most of the car models, are imported from PCARS2 meaning they look old, incomplete and fake.

As in, you want to run races or a custom championship. If you just want to hotlap by yourself, then you only need the original Assetto Corsa. 

The AI is actually fairly decent, and that makes it the best opponent AI on the market (sadly). You can fine-tune their speed and their aggression precisely. You will have to dial them in per car/track. (80 AI will smoke you with vintage F1 cars, but perhaps in GT3 cars, you will win with the AI even at 95, for example)

Current system:

CPU: 3700X
GPU: 5700XT

I run with a field size of 20.

Using a Valve Index. 

Settings on medium to maintain 90 fps on most races. It looks fantastic. Visuals are clear and sharp. The weather & day/night cycle are also industry leading. Don't be fooled into thinking Assetto Corsa accomplishes the same thing with a shader mod - it doesn't. AMS2 will have actual puddles/pools of water forming on the track - and you will feel each and every one of them.  Sounds are only average - ACC does that better.

I only started playing since 1.2.2.0 (very recently) and have put a lot of hours in (as you can see). I can't speak to the physics before this patch, but I promise you this is a hardcore simulator. I've seen videos of people complaining about physics issues such as lift-off oversteer being non-existent, strange rear differential behavior, cars not turning, etc.

I have raced about 80% of the vehicles in the AMS2 so far now and I cannot report any of these issues. In fact I could point to a car that exhibit lift-off oversteer (Ginetta G55 Supercup), cars that have most types of rear-differential you could think of (locked, open, LSD, just not a torque vectoring that I've found). They all behave correctly.  The cars respond to tuning as you would expect them to in real life (unlike rFactor2). Cars do not get sucked into the inside curb unrealistically like it's some sort of magic black-hole (such as in Assetto Corsa). Cars don't suddenly slip out from under you in a slow uncontrollable passenger slide without warning (like iRacing or ice-racing as some like to call it).  

Setups are easy to find and share within the game itself, you can check the leader-boards and pull in a car setup directly. You might be surprised to find a lot of world-records in the game are set by default setups.This should tell you something - try to change-up your driving style before messing with the car setup (beyond basic aero/fuel/tire adjustments - we are talking suspension geometry here).


Anyway, for the money, even not on sale ($120? $140? something like that) as an *overall* package, especially considering its wide display of vehicles/tracks, it is the best on the market. On sale it is a steal.

I knew it would have some issues being an Early Access title but it was much worse than I had anticipated. I refused to post the review until v1.0 because I had faith Reiza would impress us eventually and while I can confidently say this game is NOT as good as its predecessor as of v1.0, I was indeed impressed with how much they improved it in such a short time. Plus a lot of developers enter Early Access and stay far longer than scheduled but Reiza only deviated a small bit and kept true to their word.

Returning to what I previously said, it is NOT as good as AMS1 and will not be my go-to racing sim however, I will come back and check out the progress in about 6-12 months. It just isn't the overall ""total package"" that AMS1 is but to be fair, AMS1 is a culmination of their entire library of rFactor1 engine games.

The problems: Content...im my opinion you are getting less content than the predecessor at the onset of v1.0. A few cars were added but a LOT of cars like Petrobras de Marcas and the Porsches are gone. The Caterhams and the F-trucks have less to choose from. There are several new Formula cars and prototypes so at least they are trying and they have already stated missing cars will eventually be added in time. The part that frustrates me is that a lot of the tracks I paid for in the first game are gone and will be DLC AGAIN. I will have to buy tracks twice...granted they are having to re-build them from the ground up in a new engine so I understand why they are doing it, but it still hurts.

The audio, which is crucial in a sim... I like the attention to detail such as the turbo spooling up in turbo cars and the brakes in the F-trucks etc. However, the actual audio quality sounds way too low and I don't mean volume low. I can only describe the engines and tire noises as ""crackly."" It sounds like I'm on a low quality bitrate but there isn't an option to increase it. Some cars are worse than others but they should at least be better than the older game and I don't believe they are.

Lastly, you have to run the game in ""VR"" mode to get TrackIR to work and it's too ""floaty."" I am not a fan of the Madness engine and I blame it on that. I don't have this problem in other sims, just this and those dumb PCars games. I think this engine is all about the pretty visuals which mean literally nothing to me...so if it isn't obvious already, I was in the GT2 camp back when GT3 came out on PS2 and nothing has changed.

As for positives, there was a horrible oversteer problem almost every car had when this first came out and that appears to be gone. The game ""feels"" a lot better than the first stages of Early Access. Not just while driving but even navigating the menus. I really like the potential...that is the main positive. This game isn't a lottery pick but it is definitely a first round pick with loads of development potential.

I can't wait to see how the game is shaping up in the future, see you in 6-12 months!

Automobilista 2 is a valid, well made, serious simulation. I'm not sure how it stacks up to rFactor 1 or 2, iRacing, or Asseto Corsa. But hear me out.

I just took one of those Michael Fassbender, Prototype cars around Nordschliefe (worth the money for the DLC, 100%) and it was probably the most singularly enjoyable simulation experience in a vehcile that I've had so far. The car controls are phenomenal. People say it's based off of PC2 but that really misleads you into thinking that it's going to be a simcade, or frankly just kind of crap like that game.

If you're on the fence, and you're already a sim racer who has spent money on a wheel and whatnot, honestly don't even think twice. But the game, buy the Nordschleife, put it on 30X time mode and just enjoy it.

I've been simracing for a couple of years now but the last two years i've taken a break from it. I used to play a lot of AC and PC2.

After 20 hours I can say I am over the moon of how amazing this sim is and the potential moving forward is immense.

The force feedback on my G29 with the custom FFB files are so good, I can literally feel everything the car is doing and I can't even imagine how a DD would feel like. Compared to AC the FFB is much more alive but much better than the one from PC2.
Physics wise I think it's really good

The content is just so good. Sure there are some tracks like Monza, Le mans etc that you would like but with all the Brazilian tracks, all the historic tracks ( I love them!) and all the different cars I'm just having a blast.

The UI is slick! Very easy and user friendly, AC and Raceroom makes me feel like i'm using and old tech demo from the 90s.

pros
- runs well (atleast single screen
- imo very nice sound effects  and its loud (sometimes to much)
-easy to set up 
- track and car options are broad and intresting
- ai is very decent in racecraft in human vs ai or ai vs ai (and godlike if you have seen where it started)
- single player is not deep but not hollow 
- its one package (if you bought the bundle otherwise the dlc  is a seperate discusion)
- very good support from the developers
- default setups are really usible 
- pleasure to drive the game
- setting up the car is easier than in most sims imo 
- custimazible race lengths and dates
- weather system that is really fun for a short 24 hour race (so setup with time progression  to the max and thus a entire 24 hour race in 24 min)

cons
- when you dont own the bundles  it can be expensive for what you get and depends on you want and can get 
- things very rarely can feel weird or out of line  with reality or atleast to more realislitic sims out there (i will get to it) 
- (this might be cuz i have a low buget wheel t80) but the limit  i hard to notice, hear or (well not in my case but i have had a tmx with force feedback) feel the limit which ofthen leaves you wondering if you overpushed the car  or that its setup or even the game what is quit unfortuned (tip if in doubt with a car 15 min practice 5 lap race can help you atleast fix what hopefully is setup wise
- sometimes clunky with ui and menus

con\pro\neutral 
- the realism is a troubled topic imo yes it isnt really in alot of moment being able to catch slides and the amount of grip it really depends on your personal opinion if you wants this product 

i would say get it if your massivly single player like me but otherwise reconsider  i hope it helps someone

AMS2 offers a great variety of cars and tracks. There are tracks I never heard of before but are great choices for racing. The cars are categorized in classes and within one class the performance is balanced. The cars often do not have the official livery but thats not a big issue for me. Important is that they make fun to drive and this is the case.

The thing I like a lot about AMS2 is that you can just choose the car and drive it. Its still not easy to master a car but you can drive out of the pits and learn the car. You do not have to struggle with the setup, if you don't want to. Just take enough fuel with you, set the tire choice to automatic and go racing. This is a great thing compared to e.g. ACC, were I need to have the correct setup for the track and watch for the tire pressures to have a competitive car.

There is a big discussion going on in the sim racing community about what game on the market simulates the cars the best. In my opinion the simulation in AMS2 feels great and I'm having fun with it. I'm not a racing driver so I don't know the real deal. But at the end of the day I want to have a good race after learning a car and have fun while fighting for positions and AMS2 delivers this.

The AI drivers are good and competitive if set correctly. They are fast, they attack you, they attack each other, they do mistakes, they sometimes crash by themselves, you can drive side by side through corners with them. It is very good!
But you have to try the skill and aggression setting of the AI according to each track and class to get the most out of it. A great thing is that you can drive with the AI in multiplayer! I often setup a multiplayer lobby for my friends and me and let the rest of the field be filled up with AI. This way you do not have multiplayer races with only 5 people on the track. Also if someone is a bit slower than his friends or makes a mistake, he can still fight for positions with the AI.
""Quick join human only multiplayer"" is currently scarce. Outside of leagues there is not much going on. If you start a server others will join and depending on the drivers you will have a wreckfest or a good race. The usual stuff like in other sim racing games but you have to start the server yourself. It is not just there to join.

The weather and time system is great and looks very good. You can set the starting time, time multipliers, set slots of weather which will distribute the chosen weathers over the race. You can also set the weather to the historic weather data of the chosen day or use the current weather according to live data. Currently they also implement seasonal differences for the tracks according to the set date.

Performance wise the game runs and looks great. It is not as ressource demanding as e.g. ACC, has a clear image like AC and rFactor2 and runs stable with changing weather and time. It was a good choice to use the engine base of Project Cars 2.

From it's initial release on Steam to now, Automobilista 2 has quietly updated it's way from feeling incomplete and missing something to one of the better sim racing titles on the market.  From the sim racing newbie just trying to get his feet wet, to the hardened veteran on some of the higher end equipment, AMS2 is extremely easy to set up, hop on the track, and feel the rush of some of the best sim racing has to offer in seconds.

Graphically, as most people may already be aware, AMS2 uses the Project Cars Madness engine.  This is a great thing because not only is it extremely well optimized, both in VR and on a single or triple screen setup, its visuals also happen to be fantastic.  If you are new to sim racing, this is a pretty rare combination.  Heck, this is the holy grail combination when it comes to graphics in [b]most[/b] PC games, let alone racing ones.  Did I mention all environmental factors can be tweaked?  Day or night, rain or shine, any date on the calendar, race conditions are extremely customizable.  Visually, its ahead of the competition, and could even be considered top tier, given the age of some of it's competitors (I'm looking at you rFactor 2.)  ACC may have it beat on a flat screen, but it doesn't have AMS2's level of optimization.

I can't speak for the way this game feels much while trying to play with a controller, but with a wheel (both on a g29 and a t300,) the force feedback is pretty solid.  As time has progressed it's only felt better to me as they've continuously updated things.  Bumps in the road, hitting the apex of a turn, barely touching a kerb while tracking out, all feels really great and immersive.  The game really gives you a solid idea of what your car is doing on the road.  It doesn't punish you mercilessly for over driving the car, like say iRacing can. 
 Physics for the most part feel believable and realistic.  And as I stated earlier, updates have only improved things over time in the physic department too.

Sound wise it's more or less run of the mill.  It's not anything to write home about, but I also wouldn't consider it bad.  It's adequate and immersive enough.  People thinking this game is a Project Cars 2 clone would be mistaken, it's definitely better sound wise.

Even though this game isn't moddable when it comes to cars and tracks, it's still got more than plenty to offer.  It has a very wide variety of tracks and cars.  Most of the hits are included here.  Some may not like that a nice chunk of the content leans towards Brazilian racing, but I think there's plenty here to enjoy even if you took out that content.  Why you would want to do that?  I don't know.  Bottom line is you won't get bored trying different tracks and cars in this title.

As with most sim racing titles, the AI has it's strengths and weaknesses.  I think the AI has improved but its very track and car dependent.  Like most titles, you can tweak their aggression and skill levels.  They will absolutely give you an aggressive, competitive race, though sometimes they can feel a bit on rails.  I think the best thing about the AI is that they can be added to online races.  Have a few friends but don't want to do a race with just 3 people?  Fill out the field with the appropriate level AI and you will have a hassle free, co-op online race on your hands.  This is something that's lacking in most sim racing titles on the market so this is a big plus.  I wish more games would let you do this.

Overall, and I know there's more detail I could go into here, AMS2 is a fantastic title that I can see myself sinking tons of hours into now that it's received continuous updates.  Is it worth the price tag?  Absolutely.  No sim racing game is perfect, but this title is slowly making progress in that direction.

I did have an issue not being able to get the game started but with the help of a friendly gamer and the quick actions of Reiza, this has now been resolved. For the time being. 

However, I still do not recommend this title due to, in my opinion, the horrible feel this game has with regards to it's physics model. I tried a few vehicles and they all felt, quite frankly, horrendous. If anyone has experienced the air hockey tables from amusement arcades will understand what this game feels like to play. Whilst no one who has devoted many hours to sim racing, expects a plug'n'play experience, neither do they expect Ice Road Truckers. 
Now, comparing one sim to another isn't always necessarily fair in some respects, this time however I believe is. Especially when you consider that the comparison is between two titles that were developed by the same studio. Yes, AMS2 is far superior in looks, and so on, because of the Madness engine that did PCars1 & 2 so well but looks are not everything. People still happily play GTR2 from days when my hair still had colour and didn't sprout from my ears. So what happened? That is indeed a good question but not one that I have an answer for. Does using the Madness engine prevent Reiza from emulating the fine FFB & physics from the og AMS? Maybe, maybe not? What I can say is that PCars, whether you believe it to be true sim or simcade, was for a few years arguably the most enjoyed sim on the market along with AC. Today, the best out there, for me has to be ACC but this has limited content. For content junkies you may still prefer PCars2. Otherwise it's between the more expansive titles of iRacing (subscription) or R3E. Never tried the former so can't comment on gameplay but R3E I have and it does feel substantially different to ACC. Probably in part, and not withstanding it's from a seperate developer, due to it's age but still good nonetheless and is being dragged kicking and screaming into the 2020's with new ffb and physics bit by bit.

I will keep an eye on AMS2 because I feel not doing so would be doing it an injustice. Reiza studios are a good group and their original was so good & quirky with it's content, truck racing anyone? So, fingers crossed for the future of AMS2.",1625757317,1626657973,False,0,0,0.490506350994110107,3,True,False,False

Over the months it improved bit by bit and currently it is starting to get rather nice. It is a small (ish) company that has to decide what to focus on in what time period. sometimes there is a content addition (free of payed) that has some nice items and sometimes it is a game improvement. It is getting better and better but it isn't there yet, at the moment it's better than a simcade but it isn't a hardcore Sim yet. Content wise there is a lot of choice in cars and tracks. Cons: Some cars classes have a nice collection but also some classes only have 1 or 2 cars. Sometimes a game upgrade forces you to reset your setups, it means that work is being done on the game (which is a good thing) but it's bloody annoying. AI is getting better and better but sometimes really hate you and kill you.....
Summary: is it a bad thing it isn't a hardcore Sim? I don't think so.

It is also impossible to figure out how to turn off the cockpit ""shaking"" like you can with other titles, or even turn off the steering wheel so I can use the electronics I purchased on my own instead of this ""video game.

- AI's behavior is quite good most of the time

Cons:
- Not enough cars within a given class (only 4 GT3 cars for example)
- The handling may vary from very enjoyable to undrivable (driving karts is just a nightmare)
- Sometimes AI cars push you off track in straight line (they don't ram you but get stuck behind you and push you because they are faster). Also their behavior can be irritating on fast tracks (Hockenheim historic for example).
- The developers don't provide a detailed long term road map (you just know that there will be more US tracks in the future DLCs but you don't know which one precisely). Choosing between buying individual tracks or packs can be a difficult decision. When in doubt I just don't buy anything until I see the actual content of the pack.

The game is still in early access and it shows. Some basic things are missing but you can still have fun.

Pro: - unique car/track roster - VR - Quick/casual multiplayer - Graphics - realtime weather/time

Con: Physics and FFB are not that good at the moment. Some cars have an overkill of oversteer. Slides are easy to catch though. AI needs a lot of work too. My biggest gripe is the VR. It still has those awfulll jaggies everywhere and i'm running at 1.3 supersampled. It just looks bad.

Im going to return to this game in a year or two. I still recommend because at that price its a good investment and i want to support race-sims as much as i can. It will get better. But right now, AC with mods is still where it's at for me....


Revised review:

With custom FFB you are able to enjoy this game. Physics-wise however it will never be simulator (Reiza admittedly gave up on serious physics tweaks). 

Can't recommend this because it still has soooo many problems and online is dead. Worst culprit is that you have to delete your save game in order to make the game work proper after an update. I almost broke my T300 wheell because of this!

All fun aside, the reality is AMS2 has really flourished in recent months.

The graphics? They're so good you can easily convince your friends it's real life. Nothing I've ever seen on my monitor or in my VR headset has looked this flippin' good. I come from iRacing, so obviously I'm not picky about this. However, the visual fidelity shocks me everytime I get into AMS2. It's really, really, really beautiful.
 
    I drive in VR and compared to the other sims I've ran AMS2 is the absolute best. Optimization is very good, not running into FPS inconsistencies. Does everything in VR better than any other, so this is the sim you want if you are looking for the best VR driving experience sim-racing has to offer. I use a Oculus Rift CV1, and I've got so much pixel density I can run- I've got it set to 150% with all the graphics maxed out. This is the only sim I can do that in! I think even RF2 could take notes on how well AMS2 does with VR. 

   In terms of simulating, it does it very well. It's came a long way, and there's a lot of options in the menus you can alter to suit your preference of realism and immersion. I can't say or not if it's the best simulator strictly speaking, but I don't see a problem with it. I don't see any issues with the simulation aspect, it's good! Running a Fanatec CS 2.5 wheel base and clubsport v3 loadcell pedals I am happy with the FFB performance and it suits me well. 

    Another thing about the simulation aspect of it- It's the very best simulator for driving in the rain or in wet conditions. You're not following the dry line but slower. Instead, you're doing what you can to avoid putting the wrong wheel in that puddle of water because you'll regret it. That's not to say you're certainly dead if you do hit a puddle, the car will behave in a manner that is consistent with what you'd expect IRL. No other simulator does rain and wet conditions like AMS2 does. They really did phenomenal with it. 

   Another very, very good thing about this sim is they are always updating it. You can look at their update activity and they are aggressively updating the game. If I were to guess, it's because they want to be the best sim out there. At this rate, they might be. I believe in them. AMS2 has came such a long way since it was released and right now they've got an extremely well put together motorsport simulator in a 60$ package. 

   They are really fun with these updates sometimes too. Not all the DLC costs anything. Some updates they like to surprise us with new cars and tracks, and they're good too! Last I heard they announced they're including a 1987 911 with one of their regular updates soon. I am VERY much looking forward to driving it through the Nordschleife when it drops! 

 Multiplayer? Ehh, I wouldn't count on their being too much activity searching for a random server and jumping in. If you really want to compete against other people you'll need to look for a League. I think with more people realizing AMS2 rocks now we'll have more multiplayer activity to jump right into but it's worth mentioning this. 

 AI on the other hand, is done very well in AMS2 and when you race them you're using or learning racecraft. It's good, best I've seen. They did a good job with the AI. 

  My favorite feature in AMS2? The Leaderboards. I've lost so much time chasing world records, and I couldn't love this feature more. It's good fun, and really scratches that itch for me. I'm a Nordschleife addict so go figure lol. 

  So yeah, I recommend you buy AMS2. 

  Get AMS2, you won't regret it. 


Also, Reiza, if you REALLY like my review, how about putting a Ruf in one of those updates? I'd just love to drive a Yellowbird through Nords <3

Then I found Assetto Corsa and had a blast playing it after getting a hold of an Audi which was much easier to control. I moved on to ACC and finally got the hang of it, so the other day I found Automobilista 2 and decided to give it a shot while it's on sale.

At first I had the same reaction I had with PC2 (and for obvious reasons). The first few hours was nothing but frustration after I couldn't get past the first tight turn on any track at a decent speed without losing the back end. Then the 2nd tight turn, then one lap, then an entire race. Finally I had slowly built my way up to being able to stay on the road. How?

I took the time to learn how to properly setup the car and tame it. The default setups were mostly a recipe for disaster for an inexperienced sim driver like myself. But most importantly, I stopped just expecting the game to adapt to how poorly I drove (full throttle arcade racing style) and started learning how to race in a simulation engine.

Once I humbled myself enough to do those two things, the game became very enjoyable and now I'm having a blast battling it out with aggressive AI and have even managed to get in the top 20 on a time trial, which I never would have thought possible a week ago.

Automobilista 2 is (to me) more difficult to master than Assetto Corsa, and perhaps even ACC (which I think provides better default car setups). I don't know if that means it's more realistic or just different than the AC franchise since I've never driven an actual race car, but it's pretty satisfying to finally get the driving down.

I still get frustrated at times, but it's at myself now and not the game. At times I tend to still press the gas a bit much or hammer the brake in the wrong place and lose control of the car, but I now realize it's on me to learn the car and the track and manage my speed and braking better.

The graphics are great, the sounds are pretty good (I prefer AC's in car sounds, but I haven't tried that many cars yet), but what stands out to me so far is the AI. The AI in Automobilista 2 (in my early usage) seems to be more competent and realistic feeling. At times it's almost like I'm driving against other humans due to it's aggressiveness. It's a very challenging game and I like that because it means I will end up playing it for a long time.

[i](A copy and paste from an forum I wrote thread  on Formula-Retro driveability for AMS 2)[/i]

I've been watching this thread ""with some interest as classic and vintage cars are my bread and butter in sims (which is why I don't own ACC as I'll prob never drive those cars)

(A little about me, for perspective)
Only recently got AMS2 after watching and waiting for improvements I knew it needed. I''m not new to car sims in general and have a number of them, incl AMS1) but I'm a bit more of a casual than most in these forums I would guess. (I'd rate my car setup knowledge a 6/10 for sim guy, not IRL car engineer, it would be lower)

[b]My personal thoughts:[/b]
The retro cars (and many other cars in AMS 2 I've tried) seem to suffer from often non optimal default setups). This is not idea for new guys and those not very familiar with tuning a car. I've driven the BT44 the most and , this car for example is not great with stock settings IMHO.
I still prefer the RF2 driving experience for these type of cars (esp the F1 retro cars). They are just more fun to drive.

[b]Indirectly related thoughs (this impacts mainly car setup)[/b]
The other main thing lacking in AMS2 is information. This is more important to ppl using AMS2 for 1st time. ie missing tool tips, or incorrect wording(or unclear that's clearly a copy and port from something else at times. Other sims that have been around longer do this better, even some of the older ones with old retro UI's have even done this better.
For example RF2 which is known for its dated interface (its improved) does a better job of conveying info to the user and has better default car settings IMHO. AMS 2 is going to suffer player base because of this IMHO (def needs work here for 1st time buyers). I don't think it would take a lot to get this right for a professional technical writer.

[u]If you are not going to include a manual with your product[/u] , make the UI crystal clear and easy to understand what each thing means (this forum(and the net) is full of people confused on UI settings and what they specifically do in AMS2).

[b]My wish('s) for AMS 2:[/b]
1)Improve the newer player experience by more tool tips (and clearer wording)
2)Improve some of the default car setup's.
3)Fix some of the track camera positions, most ppl want to see the car not the trees and other things blocking the view.
4)Improvements to moving the camera around in replays. Its a huge waste of such a good looking game when u have to fight the camera to watch your car.
4)I'd love to be able to save any replay not just a whole race, (sometimes u want to capture ""that thing"" and u can't), I see no reason u can't save these.
(maybe cars should bounce off side walls, currently its like a Wiley coyote cartoon where he hits the wall and slides down it)


[b]On car setup in game[/b]
I think once you get to car setup , you need to do your own homework outside the sim. The what/how or it's too much extra work for developers for info that could be explained better outside the sim.

What is more important is the user interface makes it easy to understand the setting you are changing (it's clearly defined, as dif sims use dif terms and units etc). And the base setup is not giving very poor results 'out of the box'. They just needs tweaking for the different tracks and conditions.

There are settings open to interpretation (or experimentation) trying to understand how it's being used by the game , (not just car setup settings) but what it actually specifically altering (some of the wording in AMS tool tips that do exist could be more clearly explained, (think novice, not engineer).

Project cars 2 does this quite well where everything explains what it is and does, prob as good as any sim around (same madness engine). It's a strong point of this sim (I'm just comparing the user interface and information provided, not car physics/handling, FFB etc (even if it also has more configuration then AMS) There is a night a day difference between AMS2 and a lot of sims in the one aspect.

I find myself frustrated with AMS 2 because it feels like an incomplete product , that's not polished to the same level of completeness (driving physics , ffb aside) when u compare it side by side with something like PC2 we where have the opposite issue, polished but very flat to drive and less sim like.

 I guess I wanted to see RF2 in a PC2 graphics engine, and it fails both aspects in current state, and its even more noticeable in the retros IMHO. 
(graphics and sounds are good to very good, thats not a problem)

[b]Is it worth a buy?[/b]
 yes , IF u really love car sims and you have experience with sims and setup. (as a pure novice there are better options IMHO for you)

It is still very much in development at present from DLC which cover future content well into 2022 that is clear , I consider it very much an unfinished product in its present state, and it has had a lot of work done and since (lots of improvements) release 12 months go , so lets see how it looks in 2 years from now.

Graphically - this sim looks and feel fantastic. On ultra, it runs buttery smooth. Even in VR I can max out the graphics and while not buttery smooth at all times on ultra, there is no problem getting lost in the immersion.

I don't use VR too much though, I prefer triples - and on triples it runs buttery smooth at all times.

I think this title is a huge bonus to the current available sim racing games for PC & its easy user interface is magic & easy to use ... DD wheel manufactures should embrace this title as it will be a real winner in bridging casual racer to hardcore sim aficianado - hopefully driving down hardware prices for the common racer so they can upgrade.

This review will be written from a veteran Sim-racer's perspective, and is meant to be a critique on how the game is today, and how it compares to launch and other games in the genre.

For the basics here with AMS 2, we have to look at the Madness Engine first of all. The Madness Engine was made by the creators of the Project Cars series and was an engine designed for games to bridge the gap for the typical Gran Turismo or Forza Motorsport enjoyer to a more serious simulator experience. As a result of this, Reiza studios has bitten off perhaps more than it can chew. The engine is the backbone of a racing game, simulator or arcade, and when the engine is simply not proven to be an accurate model of realistic physics, you end up with what AMS 2 is: a giant game of catch-up from launch. I want to be clear, Reiza studios are very good at what they do. Looking at where the game is now versus where it was on launch is night and day, but even still, the game is far away from their objective of making a racing simulator in the Madness Engine.

So why is the game not a simulator after all this work by Reiza? Why is it not very realistic? Well, it's the same problem that Project Cars 1 and 2 had, and it's completely related to the physics engine and how everything is simulated in the car. The cars don't feel and drive like real racecars. They just don't. They are extremely bouncy, and exhibit weird behaviors when it comes to oversteer. The cars feel detached from the road somehow, like the simulator is simulating what it thinks the car should do instead of what the car is doing on the surface of the track if that makes any sense. With some precise tuning, you can tune out a lot of this strange behavior admittedly, but the amount of work on the user to make the car feel like a car instead of some abstract car-like thing is a bit much.

With the critique of the physics out of the way, there are actually some good things I can report on when it comes to the simulator side of things. The tracks are actually well made and seem very accurate for the most part. Some of the cars really gel and drive well even with the aforementioned physics issues, and whether or not they are accurate to their real counterpart, I can't say, but they are blasts to drive. Graphically, the game looks impeccable. The weather and day/night cycles are beautiful and showcase exactly why a developer would want to go through the effort of trying to turn the Madness Engine into a simulator. The graphical fidelty is simply unmatched, and the VR performance is great. These are all very good things going in favor for Reiza and AMS 2.

AMS 2 I feel also suffers from content bloat. There are so many different cars and tracks, and while this sounds great on paper, you quickly notice that between the different cars there seems to be a difference in feel and handling. Some cars handle in what seems to be the best the Madness Engine can offer, and others feel like driving a car straight out of Gran Turismo 3. This was a complaint I had about Project Cars 2, and when you look deeper into the game, you notice that there's a lot of similarities here. Where the first Automobilista succeeded, the second seems to have forgotten all those lessons. AMS 1 was really unique because it focused on tracks and cars that weren't run-of-the-mill by industry standards. It was Brazilian series and tracks, and while there is a lot of those in the game, it's clear that Reiza wanted to try and do what everyone else is doing, but better.

The game really feels like it has landed itself right next to Project Cars 2 in a lot of ways; too wide of a scope, and not realistic enough, yet wants to be seen as a simulator. On a graph with PC 2, I'd say AMS 2 is ever so slightly more towards a simulator than PC 2. Diehard fans of this game will absolutely hate me saying this, but I have quite a lot of experience in both games, and if you blindfolded me, hid the UI, and had me drive a car that was in both games, I'd have a hard time telling them apart. I can willingly admit that even though I despise PC 2. With that said, the lows of AMS 2 aren't the same lows of PC 2, and the highs are quite a bit higher, and it is a superior product. 

This game almost makes PC 2 completely obsolete, which if Reiza took that as a benchmark, they at least are passing there.

Compared to other games in the genre on the market, I find it hard to recommend AMS 2. If you are wanting a good single-player sim-esque experience, I'd strongly recommend F1 2020. If you want a very good looking and sounding competitive online racing sim with a narrow focus, I'd recommend Assetto Corsa: Competizione. If you want the complete package in terms of accuracy and multiplayer racing, iRacing is the gold standard. And lastly, if you want a simulator with a wide breadth of content spanning many series and tracks with online and offline support, there is always RFactor 2 or Assetto Corsa, both of which do what AMS 2 wants to do.

At this point in time, I think AMS 2 is a fun game with some potential, and is definitely one I will be personally keeping my eye on because I really want this game to succeed. I want the Madness Engine to be able to deliver accurate driving cars and to be beautiful and have the best of all worlds. I guess that is what we all want, but sometimes what we want is just a dream that is not possible in reality.

Unfortunately AMS 2 gets a C- for me right now, and I'd say unless you really have a desire for Day/Night cycles in VR out of the box, stay away but keep your interest piqued. If Reiza nails this thing, it will be truly spectacular.",1625027575,1625027575,False,152,14,0.67384105920791626,0,True,False,False

The physics in this game is a hit and miss scenario. With some cars such as the GT3 cars feeling pretty good in alot of areas there is still the feeling that the car isnt actually attached to the road, and gives off a sense that the car is floating around all over the place. Other things include in some mid speed corners the tyres just lose all grip and makes the car go in a straight line with unrealistic understeer. The opposite problem appears in Mid & rear Engine cars throughout the whole game as for the turning physics, Lift off over steer does not seem to exist, Even after cranking the diff in settings lifting off just makes the cars under steer. But while the GT3 cars in this game still feel good, other sims execute them far better. Reason why I am using the GT3 cars as an example so much is that it is the most popular form of sim racing. So while they are good in this game, there is literally no reason to return to this game for the GT3 as they are (In comparison to other sims) Mediocre at best.

Other issues in this game include the UI, at times it's really neat and laid out spot on, and then other times it completely throws that on its head, like in the post race menu you have all the options for the game neatly laid out on the right hand side, but then you look for Exit game, ITS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SCREEN and doesn't look like a selectable option. Why is that there, why is it not just under all the other options. It's a silly thing to be annoyed about i know but when its something so simple that has been messed up that bad it really stands out.

Grass physics in this game are some of the worst I've ever felt. It is literally comparable to driving on ice, and I've played IRacing. Its such a fundamental part of the racing that honestly good grass physics are needed. because yes you should lose time from doing a mistake onto the grass, but having your race completely destroyed by simply driving a tiny piece onto the grass is unacceptable.

Non of the Formula cars or karts feel good or sound good. Its very hard to find one good feature about them. Very very poor attempt. The Karts especially, I use a Fanatec DD1 and for some reason the game doesn't adjust the linearity automatically, You need to adjust it for EVERY CAR in your Wheel settings separate from the game. With the karts physics it has the weird turning aspect where the car has very little grip, so you keep turning and turning, but when you reach maximum lock the grip decides oh im a kart now and turbo charges it almost so you over grip. Its very very bad.

Graphics in this game however are spot on and its no surprise coming from the madness engine. Every detail in the game looks fantastic, cannot fault the sim in any way for that.

Weather aspects  also an excellent part of the game too. no other game has a weather system like it and some of the visuals and weather slots you can create are honestly breathtaking.

I Have alot more to say but long text reviews are boring.

I do not recommend this sim. Its Flaws far out weigh the positives. If you want a sim that does all of this stuff and way better then play Assetto Corsa with all the MODS. Yes mods can be a pain if youre just starting but once you get used to it, it is a joyful experience.",1624874237,1624874237,False,14,4,0.607003986835479736,0,True,False,False

I didn't know until after I bought it that it's based on the Project Cars 2 engine. That's not a problem as such, I like Project Cars 2. But a lot of it is a LOT like Project Cars 2.

At first, it felt like a mod for PC2. When you're not driving, the UI compared with PC2 ranges between ""the same"" and ""tweaked"". But the tweaks seem to be for the better overall, and the whole package feels tighter than PC2.

Driving, on the other hand, feels a lot different. I'm not sure yet if it's better or worse, but it's different. The FFB on my Thrustmaster TS-XW also feels different, but definitely for the better. But I still like PC2 also. Drifting feels much better. Also, the audio seems to be better overall. I'm not thinking of the engine noise as much as everything else.

Project Cars 2 is more polished. Also, I frown on the business model for this sim, like how some pretty major tracks are missing (so far), and a few standards are paid DLC. This game is great, and I recommend it if you like PC2, or games of that ilk, but I suggest you do like me and buy it on sale. The base game was only $20 on sale. I also bought the track pack on sale, and it's good. I'll wait on the rest of the DLC until it too goes on sale, to soften the financial blow. My eyes narrow at a $100 season pass.

And one more thing: the UX design. O M G! Have the author of the menu ever heard about it?? It's unbelievably terrible, confusing, chaotic and bugged. It has the exact same bug when assigning gamepad controls as Project Cars 2 had (which made me refund back then) - it absolutely randomly sais it detected multiple inputs and therefore the assignment failed. If you repeat the same assignment for a while, like 5 - 20 times, it eventually registers it, but man, thats just mad.

The only reason I have not refunded yet is that I'm waiting for the Air Link to finally officially roll out to my Quest 2 device, so I can try without the Virtual Desktop.

It's important to remember this is an Early Access title, and Reiza is a very well respected developer who has already made lot's of hotfixes and updates in the month it has been out.

FFB: Better than AC. Probably closest/on par with ACC in terms of information through the wheel, however I feel like this is more natural everrrrr so slightly. Really pleasant to feel how the tyres are loading up, as it is translated well.

Graphics: Being on Slightly Mad engine it looks gorgeous and runs very smoothly at all times of day, with the possibility to improve the graphics over time as the engine improves. I haven't noticed any performance drop in rain or with multiple cars .(GTX980Ti 2015)

Weather: It has tons of weather options, times of day, and the option for changeable weather, or random dynamic weather. It all looks excellent, even in VR. It basically looks like AC with SOL but better.

Physics: Not quite there in terms of the tyre model of some cars, but the majority are good, and some of the more popular series feel sublime. However, Reiza are constantly working and improving their cars. They've shown with series like the Stock Car V8 and the current version of Formula V10 that they can *nail* the tyre model and handling aspect, I have no doubt that it will get up to that same objective standard in all other series too. For instance, the V8 Formula Car feels slightly weird at the edge of grip. Some collisions cause weird effects to happen, such as slowing the car drastically upon brushing a barrier. Which again, is fixable.

Tracks: Personally, I love a lot of the Brazilian tracks. Ibarra, Guapore, Curvelo, Interlagos etc, all feel amazing to drive. Oulton park is a very nice circuit where most corners are mid/high speed, as is Donington. I hope to see more of the generic ones everyone loves also though, such as Spa. I feel it will attract a massive amount of new players in the future. But i'm sure things like that are on the roadmap

AI: Haven't tested it.

My recommendation is this: Try Stock Car V8 at Donington, run 20-30 laps. The car warms up very nicely and convincingly after one and a half laps, uncovering its true potential. The tyre fall off feels convincing and lovely too. The Formula V10 at Interlagos is another one to try. Those combinations have won me over entirely. The slip angle on the Formula V10 feels spot on

I started with AC and PC2. I still play a ton of AC and bounce between ACC, AC, rFactor 2, AMS, and now AMS2. As a sim racer, I honestly think most people should own this game, it will only improve and it has all the core elements ready to go. Once fully realised, it will be a fantastic sim.


As of June 2021 the game feels even better than before. Some cars are still not quite as fleshed out, the modern Formula cars vary in quality, but overall most cars feel absolutely superb and respond in a way what my idea of ""Realistic"" would be. DLC is coming thick and fast and they're still consistent and committed to updates, it's absolutely an incredible game.

Let me be the devils advocate. We all suffer cognitive biases in on moment on another. I think the reason why some famous sim-racers talks down this sim, is just because they are not used to its physics engine or how the sim really works. They are, however, used to their older sims where they played 10000 hours and spent good money on it. 

That impression that they pass on their youtube videos is that they start the game and,  play a 15 minutes race here and there and says that the game is bad and that is purpose should be questioned, hinting that maybe it should not exist. 

I think that is unfair. 

Look at the GT going to the Olympics. Although it is nice to have sim-racing as a sport there, the reality is that GT is a bit shortsighted in terms of user base, specially in times where you can not find a ps4/5 for sale.

Anyhow, the GT physics, as far as I know, is far less robust than any other sim, possible less complex than project car 1/2. 

But its complexity is not the point, see?  the point is that it is competitive, well structured and requires training and dedication to master it. 

Same applies to AMS2. Although its improvements are deployed fast, its physics engine is not perfect. But it is competitive and has a physics that is close enough to allow drivers to understand and predict grip-levels, weight-distributions ... , even if they aren't 100% realistic. 

Either because of lack of resources or lack of data, each sim will have its own limitations. 

What I consider wrong is people that got used to limitations and imperfections of  Sim A and Sim B, telling everyone that AMS 2 Sim is not good because it has limitations and imperfections. 

Look at Daniel Ricciardo at formula 1. No one can deny his talent, but adaptation takes time. And sometimes can be extremely painful and slow for some people, even when they put the effort and is even more difficult if they don't  put any effort what so ever.

It is known that the time it takes a driver to adapt to a new car, also tells how good he is. It is true that once he is adapted, he can be the next champion, but the longer he takes the worse for him.

So in away, unless it is clearly a arcade game, which this isn't, people should face ""changing sims"" as changing cars in Formula 1. Won't be easy, will take time, it is different and might be like learning to drive again (Daniel Ricciardo words).

So forget about the haters, they are just upset that they have to pay subscription and top of the subscription they have to buy ""different"" cars that sometimes shares the same aero-balance distribution, although they might have completely different aerodynamics in real life. 

Or maybe they got good driving crap ""community content"" that is completely not realistic, that had absolutely no access to real data what so ever.

We won't convince people that don't to think.


My advice for you that read all of this is to buy to game, it is very good. 
Good physics!
Best engine sound in all sims!
Good variety of circuits!
Good variety of cars!
Steam ""join game"" button actually works!
Easy to create online server session!
Global leader board for all cars and tracks combinations!

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Follow on to AMS1 with much of the content from the original and a lot of new additions with more well-known tracks and cars. The game now uses the Madness engine from Project Cars 2 which brings the series a leap forward in graphics, VR and weather. The driving feel is different from AMS1, I'll go into more on that below.

The game has seen unrelenting updates since launch, almost every two weeks. This has left users dizzy as the game kept changing and iterating, but it shows Reiza's commitment to this project. Updates in early 2021 have refined the driving feel and started to combat the doubts on how some cars handle on track.

Giving this a cautious recommendation because I do enjoy some parts of this game, but am not fully convinced it iabout its driving experience across the car roster, and it is still has too many bugs and issues nearly a year after 1.0.

[h1]Positive[/h1]
[b]Graphics[/b] - new game engine looks good and runs pretty well without too much tweaking.

[b]VR support[/b] - runs very well and looks good again with minimal tweaking.

[b]Time trial with ghosts[/b] - this mode is fun and racing the ghosts is a nice offline multiplayer game mode.

[b]New content[/b] - more big name tracks and cars like Nordschleife, Spa, GT3. A good move to widen the appeal with more well-known content.

[b]Driving feel better than Project Cars 2[/b] - some improvement to driving feel and FFB over PC2, but still not state of the art.

[h1]Negative[/h1]
[b]Driving feel not totally satisying[/b] - mixed feelings about how this game drives.  It can feel good in some cars (Formula ultimate, Formula Vee) but I'm not convinced across the car roster (GT4). Some cars feel lumpy and heavy to handle, the driving feel is not smooth or accurate. Fun to drive, but doubts remain.

[b]Bugs and issues[/b] - still often come across issues in this game even long after 1.0. UI navigation errors, audio glitches, cars not fitting in the pit lane, freezes in multiplayer. The game is playable, but you have to tolerate a lot of minor issues.

[b]That season pass[/b] - The 2 year season pass with its big price tag was divisive. If you (will) like all the content it's fair value in the end, but it's a big gamble or even a turn off to ask users to buy 2 years of updates up front when you haven't even specified that car/track content in detail. Maybe a rollout of 4 DLC packs would have cut this content into better digestible items for customers.

[b]Low player numbers[/b] - Small online player base so not much choice in online multiplayer, unless you join some online communities who organize races.

Here are the downsides of the game:
- Suspensions are too soft, they are too bouncy especially with the Dpi cars (which you expect them to be planted and less bouncy).
-Lots of on power oversteer (which can be corrected easily) but really unrealistic.
-The car physics are different on each car some cars drive good the others don't.
- Tyre model is not great especially in the latest gen F1 cars. When you lock up then try correct the slide you are always going to spin no matter how hard you try to catch it. 

Positives:
-New weather system is great.
-For the first time in all sim racing games when it rains the line differs from the normal racing line like in real life. You will see the effect of wet line especially in wet-dry transitions.
-AI is good
-Lots of tracks.
-Devs are bringing good content with every update.

With every update they are upgrading the physics. So all in all If you liked Project Cars you will like this game too but don't expect such a sim experience.

I've been playing ACC, AC, and though their physics seem more realistic, for a guy like me who is only playing with a G29 (for now), it hits the sweet spot of fun to realism. For example, trying to catch slides with a G29 in ACC is quite challenging but AM2 is a little more forgiving. The curbs in AM2 also feel more realistic through FFB on the G29. I'm not playing the game feeling like one little slip is going to ruin the race. I can finally catch a slide or slip with a lot more feeling than I can with ACC. Also, I feel like I can more effectively transfer the weight of the car using the pedals than I can in other racing titles.

It's not supposed to be a tit for tat comparison of course, I'm sure there are some of you who have the same games and same wheel and hopefully find it helpful. Until I can upgrade to a DD system for ACC (which I'll still keep playing because its addictive), it's looking like AM2 is going to get a lot of use on my system.

My G29 settings are 100 gain, 50% road surface(?), and 5% minimum FFB. I don't think dampening is very high at all. I'm reviewing playing in VR (Oculus CV1) on a 3070 with Fanatec Elite LC pedals.",1623817273,1623817760,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(A quick note. This is NOT PC2 just slightly changed and reskinned. AMS 2 is completely different except for a few UI things.)

Pros:

-Best FFB hands down. It just feels right in every single way!
-Best VR experience. It's just flawless and never stutters or skips.
-Best graphics. The sky! The sky when transitioning between day and night is unlike any other sim.
-Racing with friends. This is THE EASIEST game to setup a multiplayer room for you & your friends.
-UI. The UI is intuitive and easy to understand.
-Free content constantly added.
-Frequent updates (Debatable whether a pro or con)

Cons:

-The AI. JFC the AI are dumb. They will run right through you causing you to crash, hold you up, block you like crazy, etc. No other AI infuriates me as much as the AMS 2 AI. The AI makes me crash 10x more than any other sim I own. As a note, I play at 106 Skill and 50 Aggression atm.
-Still a lot of little annoying bugs that can ruin the experience at times.
-Still lacking customization, but that's a moot point.
-Some of the content you may want in a sim simply isn't here because its more Brazilian focused. There's a big BUT here though because new content that most other sims have is constantly being added (Look at GT3, GTE, and DPi to name a few)

Those are the pros and cons that I can come up with atm. Would I recommend this game? Yes! I recommend this sim to every single person that is into sim racing. Just buy it and see what I mean.

-Ability to easily set up private servers without port forwarding.
-handling/FFB is very good. Some complain of the lack of lift off oversteer, but I feel that this concept in other sims is over exaggerated.  This happens near the limit of adhesion in real life. In my opinion AMS2 MORE accurately portrays this concept when you are nearer to the limit of  adhesion.  At the end of the day this comes down to personal preference, and I really like.
-Great variety of tracks (my favorite being VIR), including mainstream favorites added in as dlc.  

Negatives:
- AI are much better than before but still ruin your race from time to time.
-Need more people to join in on the fun.  - This problem is mitigated because of the ease of setting up a private server with bots to fill out the field.  (This right here is what keeps me from turning on the other sims)

After a few hours on the track with AI, i would have to agree, though with one strong difference. 

AB2 is much more forgiving than what a true racing sim should be. The menu and options give a strong ACC vibe, the feedback and handling being much closer to PC2, but far more forgiving than either. A step off the track in any modern sim will spell disaster, but often times, even in the rain, a lead foot will often be forgiven and spins can mostly be corrected with reasonable effort. I have also found the game forgives SUPER late braking and will pretty much allow you to flatline into a curve at the last minute, stomp the brake, and gently roll out in a fairly unrealistic way. 

That being said, its a beautiful game with a fresh take, nice feel while driving at the limit, tons of options and regular updates, and worth the buy if you want something of a lighter hearted racing experience without going full arcade.

I'm racing in real life for over 14 years. And never have I experienced a sim that comes so incredibly close to the real thing than AMS2. For example: the rain conditions. SPOT ON! I've raced a lot in the wet. And I love it. When I drove in AMS2 for the first time in the rain. I was blown away how realistic this is.

After some time I started in some leagues. I've found great friends from everywhere in the world that are really great guys to race with. And of course at some point I created my own league. So yesterday was the release of the Racin' USA pack. What we got is revolutionary for simracing! We have 42 years of weather data from every day on every track. If I want to drive in rainy Hockenheim 2019, sure, nothing is going to stop me. I can even use the weather from Imola 1988 for example. That. Is. Mind. Blowing!

Now onto the physics. Many people don't liked them before the update. But they'll gonna like it now. You feel like you are really there in the sim. In the car and on the track.
The Youtubers that don't even have a go casually in AMS2 are so wrong. 

And now after the update a lot of online lobbys are there that are full with drivers. I've hosted multiple servers today and I had on each server max 28 drivers. AMS2 is a new Standart in sim racing. This is the future. This sim is done by a incredibly small team with a very limited budget. But look what it's become. It's become the best sim there ever was.

It's not there yet, not at all, but it has a lot going for it. First, it's gorgeous. It's literally the best-looking sim racing title I've ever played. 

Second, the physics, while not to everybody's taste, are a unique interpretation of reality. I'm not a real race car driver, so I can't comment on the realism, but some of these cars are an absolute joy to drive. 

There are still (June 2021) some major issues with this game, such as the bare bones multiplayer experience with no rankings, as well as just a general severe lack of polish (setups are a pain, pit stops are wonky, AI is inconsistent from track to track, the UI could use some major customisation, the number of liveries on some cars is very low and can't be expanded by creating more, some classes are a bit wonky to the neophyte (for example, unless you're a hardcore F1 historian, good luck parsing through the Formula Classic, which has the G1M1, G1M2, G2M1, G2M2, G2M3, G3M1, G3M2, G3M3... and then you have to figure out what's classic and what's retro (Retro G1 and Retro G2), or is it Formula Vintage (G1 or G2?) and how either of these differ from a vintage Formula V10 G1, Formula V10 G2, or Formula V12) - and telling the Formula Reiza and the Formula Ultimate apart is another can of worms). I know licensing is a thing, but it could just have been so much cleaner by just using years instead, calling cars ""Formula 1993 V12"" or what have you, rather than trying to figure out what the difference between the   Formula Classic G3M1 and the Formula V12 is. It's just not obvious.

The TL;DR: It's an incredibly raw game, to be sure, but it has amazing potential, and the sky's the limit for this title. I'm getting in on the ground floor, and I love it. If you want a more polished experience, perhaps wait a bit. It hasn't surpassed Assetto Corsa, the gold standard of sim racing, but it does offer superior graphics and far superior multiplayer settings.

AMS was my favourite sim racer by far, and I believe was the best handling racing game I have ever played, but it ran like garbage on my machine and the newer it got the worse it ran. 

So I just spotted AMS 2 out and I thought I would buy it 100% expecting the need to refund it because I wouldn't be able to get it to run. Well how wrong was I. It runs very well on medium settings on my 1060 3gb, more FPS than I ever got on AMS, so optimisation is spot on and it looks much much better. 

In terms of the game. Much of it feels familiar, the race options, the cars, the tracks, the menus, the car setup options. However, everything feels nicer, not perfect or even great but better, nice. The only noted missing class that I would like to see back was the Touring Cars (or maybe I missed them) I liked the Touring Cars in AMS, was always fun championships. The handling model is very very good again, maybe not quite as good as AMS but very close. You can tell they are from the same studio in terms of handling even though they are on different engines. I would say this is a close 2nd to AMS in terms of car handling and something I was really worried about when I heard they were moving to the Project Cars physics engine. Reiza have definitely done a great job here and being so early in the games life it shows great potential for the future.

I will add to the review as I play it more. Great great start though.

Additions

After a bit of a roller coaster with some of the early 2021 updates making the game and the cars very different and hard to get familiar with the April update has made a wonderful difference to the game.

The games has always been good to drive but some quirks here and there would come up with AI and cars in certain situations but the April release has largely resolved those. Car handling is consistent and very much how you would expect from a race car. The differences between cars even in the same categories is really nicely pronounced now. 

The GT3, Porsche Cup, GT1 and F1 Gen 3 cars are just stunning to drive and race with. I have really been getting stuck into setups and how to get the most out of the cars and the changes made to the car setup really impact the car exactly as I would expect. Everything from the LSD to the camber just makes the car work or not it is really well done.
The older F1 cars are great and bring back nostalgia of the Geoff Crammond Microprose F1 titles from the 90s and 00s. The sounds, the immersion, the racing... unbeatable!!!",1599167847,1621768487,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

AMS2 upon release has been my go to sim ever since. i do dabble with the other ones as there are some great other sims out there. but AMS2 keeps me coming back. What initially got me excited about this game was the inclusion of VR, and to be fair this is a highlight for me with AMS2. i use an Oculus Rift S and it runs brilliantly on my evga rtx 2080. I have the game on ultra settings in 1440. Looks amazing on the screen and in VR.
The FFB is being continuously worked upon and its starting to feel very nice. 

The UI can stick a little some times when going through the options so I hope this can be worked on and no doubt Reiza will tackle any if all issues that are within the game.  Given that they said this game would get 7 years development only proves what a fantastic company they are and committed to making their Sim as great as it can be.

The car list is impressive and there are some amazing ones to drive, The P3 Roco being one of my fav cars in the game, In VR racing online, well its one hell of a rush to be fair, the game for me would be worth it just for this car alone.
We have Gt3 and 4 cars, Caterham, F1 cars both modern and vintage, also Karts and even trucks to name a few.
So there is something in there for everyone no doubt, with more cars being added in updates and DLC down the road. i for one am very excited on the news of the Corvette Cr 8 coming to the game along with some new American tracks being added.
On the list of tracks we have many to drive on. It's great to see the Brazilian tracks in there as it offers something different from the usual tracks that are found in sims, but we also have the tracks we all know and love in there as well such as Oultan park, Donington, Brands Hatch and the Nordschleife which is incredible.

The one thing that i personally would love to see in the game would be a car editor for the liveries, would be really amazing to have the chance to make our own in the game and have more personalised cars as not all of us can edit cars in or have access to  photoshop.

Something else that would be great would be to have perhaps along with the default set ups for the cars, to have a loose or stable set up similar to what was done in PC2, for those of us that find it hard to be a racing driver and engineer in one.
The car set up screen are done well but for myself i don't have much understanding on car set ups so I am at the mercy of the default setups that are on offer. But don't get me wrong, the default set ups are really good and a great place to start for each car.

I hope also that we get more historic tracks down the road as there are some amazing old circuits out there to possible go for but other than that, these are just the hopes and dreams of one old sim racer :)   we can always want more, such is the nature of the beast. But so far what Reiza have done with AMS2 is amazing and i for one am here to stay for no where else gives me a racing rush as high as the one i get here in VR. I have managed a few world records  mostly at the Nordshleife in F1 cars and the sense of achievement you get considering there are some insanely good Aliens on there on the leaderboards is awesome. getting a 1st here and there was a great feeling. I love the Time trial mode but hope full replays get added at some point for this mode as it would be nice to be able to save a good hotlap  for the scrap book :)

Anyway thats my view on it. Its a work in progress folks, but the work is great so very much worth a purchase, and it goes on sale here and there so take that opportunity if it does and get this game. I very much recommend it if you are after a game that is a challenge to learn and not an easy pick up and play.

All the best

Physics wise.. well i cant really comment too deep into this but if you comparing it to other sims. its respectable. It still feels like project cars physics but it improving so much since its release. now i think it quite good. is not as bumpy anymore tho some of the cars can be a bit twitchy but id say most of the car now is pretty good. maybe you can compare this to the regular assetto corsa, i recommend you to download the custom force feedback it improve the feel of force feedback tho some force feedback files can be bad so choose wisely and do your research for the best experience.

I would consider this the real Project Cars 3 in way, just without the proper career mode - which was the saving grace of that franchise - and limited weather options compared to the second game. Basically Reiza made a good racing game in the Madness Engine which SMS was not able to do but they had to sacrifice some things in order to produce a more consistent experience. The end result, if far from perfect, is still miles better than what pC1 or pC2 could provide.
As for what is the main pull of the game, it is hard to tell. If you want competitive multiplayer you should go for iRacing or R3. If you want an advanced physics engine with some great content then rFactor 2 is the real deal. If you are into GT3/GT4 and want good physics in a well-balanced package with good multiplayer options you should get AC Competizione. And if you want unlimited amount of content/mods then the original Assetto Corsa is better than anything you will likely find in the next few years - just get Content Manager and the Shaders Patch for upgraded everything. Also, if unprecedented simulation is your jam you should check out Beam.NG. As for AMS 2 you can race on exotic tracks with alternative cars to the well-known ones. More famous tracks and cars are also being introduced so the sim becomes something of a mix of everything in the end.

Fantastic game. bugs have been squashed for the most part. no more controller rebind issues that happened in the past. the driving models have gotten much better. looks great on older hardware (gtx 1080) even in VR (Quest2). new content and cars have been great to drive.

Dec 2020:

the game itself is great once you work past all the bugs and issues that are pretty critical. no custom grid options, bad host/lobby UI (changing class/cars/needing a race restart requires a full lobby remake in multiplayer - super annoying for organized groups). frequently i have to reassign the binds to my fanatec v3 pedals to get the load cell to work correctly. MDF buttons also will stop working and need to be rebound (even though they show the bound key in the settings).

The good:
Graphically it's quite stunning and runs pretty well, though I suspect the 1080 may need an upgrade to fully take advantage of the G2.
Good selection of tracks
Good selection of racing and non race cars

The not so good: (not bad, just perhaps needing another look over)
Some of the AI is a bit err interesting(?) Goiania for example, turn one will always see an AI car dive from the right side of the track to the left - god have mercy on your soul if you're somewhere in between lol.
After one such race I pulled into the pits and the AI was essentially pinballing themselves through pit lane trying to get in their garage - I spent probably 10 mins sitting, watching, dying of laughter during one of these instances.

After having played Assetto Corsa for hundreds of hours I was keen to try out a different sim. And I have to say, this game has some really good aspects, but also some flawed ones. First of all, it has a great selection of ""unknown"" tracks (most in Brazil) which are refreshing to see. The car models and engine sounds are great, and the graphics look very impressive too! However when I tried the Nordschleife (DLC) it felt a little bit off. They say the track was laser scanned and is as accurate as possible, but it feels vastly different from Assetto corsa. Almost as if the track is a smaller scale version of itself. Yet the lap times driven seem to match those driven in Assetto (in a GT3 car). The physics feel pretty close to Project Cars 2, which in my opinion are pretty horrible, so I really didn't like that, and was hoping for something more realistic. The force feedback on my wheel (Logitech G25) was pretty lacking aswell, not being able to feel any limits whatsoever. You simply can not tell when a car is losing grip, so it's quite hard to drive on the edge, as you literally have to guess where the limit is. 

Overall it's a nice game, but it simply isn't the right game for me. I'd say if you are a fan of PC2 and are looking for a ""sequel"", this might be the game you're looking for. But if you mainly play Assetto Corsa (or competitzione) you should skip out on this one, as you'll probably be disappointed.

TL:DR - still needs some polish, that hovercraft feeling is till there. AI is junk. Potential, but not even close to AMS1.

Madness engine is great for visual clarity, game is beautiful. That's expected. Weather is solid. The issue is the feedback and tires. It just feels so spacey.. with iRacing, ACC and AC feeling much more connected to the ground, and will have a better idea what the tires are doing.

AMS2 you'll hear the slide, before you feel a slide. The oversteer is quite touchy.

I started out with stormy weather, because I wanted to see it.  The weather system is very cool.  Right out of the box you get a large array of choices for cars to practice with, liveries, tracks and customisations.  What I learned quickly was that in rainy weather, like heavy storms, it's super slippery and hard to steer.  That's fun for a bit, but you'll get very easily turned around.  

I don't see that as a bad thing.  Dry weather has different effect, so weather isn't just a pretty thing.  The graphics were turned all the way up and I was getting over 100 fps at 2k on a moderate system I built.  I tweaked the steering sensitivity and braking.  There are TONS of settings to tweak, both for the game itself and for gameplay.  It appears to have various controller types supported and can do VR.

I'll have to practice some and get into the game a bit before passing a final judgement, as initial perspective is usually not enough.  However, I feel this one has promise.  I have a lot of racing games.  My all-time favorite racing games were Blur (arcade action) and Shift 2 (more realistic).  I'm not a racing sim fanatic, so I don't care if it's super ultra-realistic driving, but this one seems to give you a good bit of control over your experience.  Right now, if I had to guess, I would put this somewhere towards the top, but we'll see.

Is it stable?  Yes.  Are there bugs?  Perhaps.  I did find one where I purposefully drove off the track into a few cars and it tossed me below the world.  Other than that it shows a lot of promise.

While I think they left early access far too early, from a financial standpoint it makes sense with Reiza being such a small developer. Each month for over a year we've gotten great updates, a consistency I haven't seen with any other game I've played. The ffb feels great, the weather is great, the optimization is great, car and track selection is great. Running triples on a 1060 6gb, no other sim I've played can come close to the fidelity and consistent 60fps. Every time I play another sim and come back to this I breathe a sigh of relief at how much better it runs. The lack of an online rating system, online championship mode and telemetry are my only gripes with the current build, but the former at least has been in the works for some time and will arrive sooner or later, not sure about the following two but given how many things on my wishlist they've already added over the last year I assume these features will come.

The effort put into this game is promising. However, there are still alot of bugs (very much the same as in Project Cars 2). 

Graphics: 9/10
- A small improvement compared to PC2
- Off-track items like trees are 2D.
- Great VR experience.
- The Madness engine is absolutely beautiful!

Gameplay 7/10
- The FFB is great. It feels quite realistic and very responsive. Better than PC2 and  AC. 
- The HUD looks very much like PC2. Great visibility and overall view. 
- Most of the cars are wobbly though. Especially heavier cars wiggle all over the place. No idea what this is about. 
- Overall, the cars feel great though.

Multiplayer 6/10
- Well, there arent alot of people playing the game...
- Additionally it is very much the same as the PC2 Multiplayer. Reiza has not fixed anything yet. But it is not much that needs to be done.

Content 6/10
- There are not that many non-brazilian cars
- DLCs are a little expensive
- There are a ton of brazilian cars. 
- Obviously more people need to buy the game so that they can implement more european and american cars. That the season-pass costs 90€ shows how much they plan to implement... Still a long way to go though.

Potential 11/10
If Reiza continues developing the game it will certainly be one of the best if not the best SIM available by the end of 2021! If you buy the game it certainly helps Reiza to achieve this. The effort they put into the game is phenomenal and inspiring!


Conclusion 39/50 (7.8/10)
The game needs some further development to be a great SIM. It will probably be good in Summer 2021 and top notch by the end of 2021.

Yes there are still some issues that are indeed frustrating, depending on the track and car selection there is still a little bit of that infamous bouncing, not to mention some downforce cars are sliding when they really shouldnt be, however that seems to be getting better and better with each patch. 

(please look into improving the Porsche Group C car, though, feels nothing like the untamed beast it actually is). then there is the AI... which in anything but an F1 car will do the most idiotic things (in my experience) unless you have their skill and aggression levels cranked way up, and in my case, far past my own skill level. which yes, does force me to drive better, and that is great, however aside from murdering you, they also have that infamous ""AI grip"" through certain corners, which is especially noticeable in the Turbo V6 F1 cars. 
which no amount of fiddling with setup, for me, brings me anywhere near them in certain situations. 
do take that with a grain of salt though as I have to perfect my input settings, but, yeah, a little frustrating lol.
is the fact that there is paid dlc sucky? kinda, I only have Spa and the Nurburgring however, they are indeed some of the best versions of each track I have ever played, and, in the case of Spa, AMS2's version is better than the F1 rendition and that is hella impressive. 


AMS2 is still a work in progress, it is a little expensive IMO and definitely has its issues, despite all that it is indeed worth the money, by no means am I a fanboi nor am I going to ignore its flaws, even with its flaws this is my favourite racing game. there are endless hours of enjoyment to be found in just tuning and hot lapping cars, competing for best times on leader boards, etc. even the gokarts are a blast (and yes I have lapped the shifter cart around spa until it blew up and no, I have not brought any kart to the Nurburgring as of justt yet), there is something here for everyone it would seem. unless Ovals are your love, there are some cool stock cars, but, not really any oval/tri-oval tracks on the roster as of rn.

Compared to ACC the ACC needs a CERN power PC to look as good as AMS2 looks with only decent PC specs. 
Ffb feel much better on my T300rs on AMS2. In ACC the limit of grip is a vague zone, you need to guess it while in AMS you feel the limit and you can keep the car on the limit. 
Compared to AC, AC feels dated and looks dated without modding. Tire model is also dated in AC and you cannot change it with any modding.
Compared to pcars2 the ffb in AMS2 is completely new, rewritten from scratch -as with all the car physics in game- light years better than pcars2, probably better that anything SMS could do. Sounds are also much better than  pcars2, there are no more generic engine sounds and are constantly being improved. The only thing pcars2 has over the AMS2 is more popular content.
Content of AMS2 isbased on Imperio endurance championship of Brazil so cars and tracks are less popular but the game also has popular content like GT3/GT4, F1 cars from 60s to our days and tracks built using LIDAR data or laser scanned data like : Imola, Red Bull Ring, Suzuka, Oulton park, Brands Hatch, Snetterton, Nordshchleife, Spa, Hockenheim.

É algo bem próximo do que deveria ser o Project Cars 2, mas com uma pitada de automobilismo brasileiro. O nome ""Automobilista 2"" é perfeito porque representa exatamente o que esse jogo é: uma evolução sincera e autêntica do querido Automobilista 1. As maiores qualidades deste novo título são: 

1) Gráficos são muito melhores e mais atuais, sem exigir muito mais do equipamento;
2) ""Force feedback"" mantendo a mesma qualidade e primor do Automobilista 1, que pra mim tem um dos melhores ""force feedback"" do mercado. Aliás, na minha opinião, o único jogo com ""force feedback"" no mesmo nível do Automobilista (1 e 2) é o Acetto Corsa Competizione (ACC);
3) AI's (ou bots) estão entre os melhores do mercado, só perdendo para os AI's do ACC;
4) O Automobilista 2 é o melhor jogo do mercado para quem curte automobilismo brasileiro, já que você pode correr com vários carros brasileiros não só atuais como também tradicionais, tais como Fusca, Chevette, Passat e até os StockCar (atuais, Opalas e Ômegas), isso sem falar dos protótipos, caminhões e diversos outros carros nacionais;
5) Ainda falanda do automobilismo brasileiro, no AMS2 você pode correr em várias pistas nacionais, tais como Interlagos, Goiânia, Curvelo, Brasília e até a saudosa Jacarepaguá, isso só pra citar alguns.

Importante dizer que o Automobilista 2 não se restringe a pistas e carros brasileiros, já que há pistas e carros internacionais também. No AMS2 há carros de GT (1, 3, 4, 5), Grupo C, Caminhões, Cateham, vários protótipos, Karts e carros de Fórmula atuais e do passado. Há também pistas tais como Imola, Adelaide e até Bathrust (Mount Panorama) inclusive, diversas pistas de kart e isso não é tudo.

Infelizmente o AMS2 também tem defeitos e para mim o pior defeito é que o jogo parece que falta um acabamento final nos detalhes, o que obviamente pode ser justificado por se tratar de um jogo relativamente novo e em desenvolvimento. Mas alguns detalhes parece que mereciam um tratamento mais cuidadoso. O Ômega StockCar é um exemplo disso. Se você conhece um Ômega StockCar de verdade você percebe que no AMS2 ele não está bem representado. Mas, como disse, confio que isso são coisas que ao longo do desenvolvimento do jogo, serão corrigidas.

O que importa é que, pelo menos para mim, trata-se de um jogo excelente, com muitas qualidades sendo que algumas são exclusivas deste título e por isso, trata-se de um jogo obrigatório para quem curte Automobilismo Virtual e principalmente para quem curte e valoriza o automobilismo nacional.

Been a ""simracer"" since back in 1998 when Papyrus brought us GPL and Nascar Racing series. Collin McRae Rally, Rally Trophy. Then onto LFS, GTR (and GTR2), iRacing, Assetto Corsa. And Dirt Rally series. RaceRoom. Assetto Corsa Competizione. WRC9 is a blast. I never got into rFactor. Most simracers seek what are supposed to be as close to real life handling and realism as you can get. I was sceptical to Project Cars 2 for a long time and the critics claimed it wasn't a sim, I then finally got a copy of it years later and clocked 227hrs as of now. I wasn't suppose to like it as much as I did, but I think it has pros and quirks that more distinguished sim racing titles don't. As does Automobilista 2.

The developers seems to be active and that was a big reason I got a copy of AMS2. But then it also has resemblance of Project Cars 2 sharing mechanics/engine, meaning the immersion and experience is the best you can get. So I thought, if you got the racing focus aspect going on here, it must be good. I'm just at 17hrs driving this ""sim"", but again if I want immersion doing a 1hr race at 1991 Spa, with Group C cars, mixed classes, going from sunset into darkness, from dry to rain, with AI that are not very predictable and has a varying degree of pace. If I want to pretend to be driving old 80's and 90's cars which is my soft spot, on historical tracks. I can build it with mods within Assetto Corsa, or I can get Automobilista 2 and have it packaged in one product.

When it comes to handling, maybe the choice of game engine has some limitations in itself, till you find out how to make use of it. For example some cars have this odd thing that when you are understeering, just steering more seems to point you back into the apex. And I drove a Caterham at Brands Hatch, going over of the hills it seemed to diff really tough through one rear wheel, which sent me straight into the armco. In other sims, you can adjust your input through the throttle pedal or drive it like that. It didn't seem ideal. I also have this issue when pushing Formula cars (like retro 90's gen 2) on exit of a corner, if the rear wheels break traction due to bumping off the grass or gravel, it will turn me a perfect 90 degree sideways instantly. Then again, I never driven a 90's Formula car, so I wouldn't know how it feels pushing it to the limit at the exit of a corner. What AMS2 does good is feeling of weight, how it transfer in a corner and sense of traction to the track. Again, when you are on the track. Online lobby GUI is bad with a lot of waiting time that cannot be adjusted. It's simple. And servers that looks open not in ""Race"" can't be accessed sometimes. Maybe due to lack of response or refresh rate. The races with decent grids are fun and tight, sometimes remind me of the huge public LFS (Live For Speed) races in 1 make XF GTi cars. The AI is good and competitive. I read that a more complete Career Mode will be released in the second half of 2021, which is something that is important to me. That will keep me involved in the sim making me show up. There are some singe player/offline championships you can choose of as of now, but they are limited and not very captivating. Just a bunch of races. Not a ladder as such or advancements/goals to reach. In the end, for me, AMS2 packages more stuff that are important to me for my experience, than more distinguished sim racing titles. I can forgive AMS2 for it's small and odd gimmicks.

This is easily my go to sim racer now. The car handling and FFB is close to spot on and gives an authentic and 'expected' feel. A lot of sims seem to have this 'hardcore' physics model that people like but is so far removed from the reality of driving a race car and the signs a car presents to you that it takes dedicated time and effort to learn the model. For me the point of a sim is to feel like it does in a car and that should not require re-learning, you should be able to pickup and go with the skills you have and when you make a mistake your response should be ""damn, I know I pushed to hard there"", not ""urgh, sims"".

Your experience will vary greatly per car per track. There are some cars that feel right and others that don't even feel like a car. Expect a few PC2 quirks to carry over. As a general opinion, cars feel floaty, have very strange understeer and oversteer, and are quite bouncy. The GT3 car pack in particular feels very foreign. To add to that, there is currently a game-breaking bug that leaves me unable to play, although it appears to be a very isolated issue. Nevertheless, I've not received any help for it

Having said all that, the tracks are pretty good, the graphical optimisation is good, AI isn't terrible, not to mention AI is supported in multiplayer, meaning you can grab a friend or two and fill the rest of the grid with AI and have a decent race. FFB is great, but I still feel it's missing something. It's almost there. Almost.

So can I recommend this? It really depends on what you're looking for, but for the full asking price? Hard pass. 50% off however is a pretty sweet deal, even if it doesn't include DLC.

1066890,87201259,76561198118218946,0,12,2505,0,838,1640408445,"The Game looks good the Graphics are Fine, The FFB is really good and you can easily catch slides very similar to AMS 1, the downside is that the tracks are very bumpy that sometimes on the straights if you are using cars that are pretty low like Formula Cars there is chance of you just randomly hitting a smalll track bump on the straights that will send you flying off to the shadow realm similar to aquaplaning, the Curbs are just as Deadly as Project Cars 2 which means even the smallest curbs that you don't think will do anything will send you spinning around such as the Acque Minerale at Imola 1988 not such a bad thing as it teaches you how to be more accurate but if your driving style is mounting the curbs and pushing track limits you will need to adjust your driving style. Car Physics is a little messy although it's consistent with slight variations between car to car which means you will eventually adjust to it, The cars are very slidy and would rotate under light braking pressure and under hard braking hairpins if you were to lock up the brakes the car just spins around instead of just going straight and not being able to turn in which is weird. if you don't have assists on which i leave off you will need to be cautious of those things i suggest changing your brake sensitivity to something low like 40-50. If you don't know how to balance, tune the car settings properly in accordance to the track you are going to be racing in and like to just jump in and race you will have a very frustrating time. The Default settings for the cars are equivalent of Loose in Project Cars 2 it's just not as uncontrollable. Lastly the AI is okay it has some work to do but i believe Reiza can make up for it, they are still raceable and sometimes you will even see them race each other which is cool. However sometimes there are the odd moments where they brake too early into a breaking zone and as a result you rear end them or it just opens up the inside for you to take, they group up huddled together all at the same speed, they never avoid crashes so you have to be really sure and committted to taking the inside line if you need because chances are they are going to t bone you if you hesitate, Don't turn up the Aggressiveness too high because they will literally run you off the road and it will turn into a Forza Multiplayer Match. I run my AI Opponent Settings at 90% Difficulty and 25% Aggressiveness just enough for them to be raceable in my opinion. Likewise to conclude i think this game has alot of potential. It is still very similar to Project Cars 2 in many aspects but with the map variety it offers and the cars It's a good purchase.

Edit (3/2/21)
I uninstalled the game because the AI is terriible they do the outmost stupidest things like slowing down on fast corners, literally ramming you off the track and they seem like they literally have unlimited grip and im not even kidding... I never knew i could get so mad at one game until i played this. No yellow flag for the AI, no safety cars just complete utter bullshittery. This game is a joke in its current state right now. It's not even worth it for the multiplayer experience because it literally offers none PC2 has more players in multiplayer than this game...  I am hopeful that Reiza will address these issues in the next coming patches then ill give it a try again but in its current state right now i don't think this game is worth it.",1613961284,1614722425,False,2,0,0.514914989471435547,0,True,False,False

They keep improving it, they keep adding cars and tracks and the Sauber C9 on the Nordschleife is my dream come true, although the standard setup is a bit bouncy. AI keeps getting better aswell, and I haven't had the game crash in a while. I tried a bit of multiplayer, not too many people, but I've had several nice and clean races with competitive drivers. There are a couple of divebombers and I am looking forward to the multiplayer ranking system. 

Would like to see DLSS implemented for VR, my 3080 is in reprojection most of the time. Still, it's okay for now. 

The rest of my review still stands:

I have hundreds of hours in each Assetto Corsa, Race07, older GT and Forza titles. Owned iRacing, rFactor 2 and Project Cars 2. The driving here felt ""right"" very quickly. I can anticipate what cars will do and can post pretty consistent times without things feeling too easy.

Bought this in summer sale when the ""final"" version was already out. Had crashes every 10 minutes, steering wheel angle did not match with most cars, game lost focus and I needed to Alt-Tab back in, but after taking a short break, I came back today and found most of my issues fixed (and the wheel angle issue could be resolved by turning my Fanatec CSR Elite's angle to ""off"" in the on-device menu).

So the positives: 

- Best VR menu I ever saw in a racing game. I do not need keyboard and mouse nearby, it feels polished and works well.
- Great FFB (still a little buggy, today I was karting and all of a sudden the steering pulled right and wouldn't want to go straight until reloading)
- Good performance and decent graphics, especially in VR. AC looks bad in comparison, even with mods.
- Awesome Time Attack / Hotlap mode with integrated leaderboard and the ability to load everybody's ghost and setup. I do a lot of time attack and the way this is implemented  is pretty much perfect. If you bin it and need to restart, you are immediately back 2-3 corners before the finishing line and at speed and can try again very quickly.
- AI seems livable so far, have not done many races but I felt the AI noticed me and reacted accordingly. But Reiza are still working on it.
- Setups stay on the car: I hated having to reload the setup everytime in AC, this feels more like the cars belong to you and you live with them.
- Sound is generally okay. The 4-stroke rental karts sound horrible, but everything else was decent so far.
- Regular updates: They add content, fix bugs, seem to listen to the community, I hope they keep it up. This game could easily live for 4-5 years if they do it right.

Negative:

- Not a huge load of content, but a great variety and something for everyone. I am excited for Nordschleife, that's the track I generally spend most of my simracing time on. Once this is available, I probably won't go back to Assetto Corsa, maybe to visit one of the many mod tracks.
- Hardly any road cars. I like putting road cars on a track like Nordschleife and see how they handle. Road cars have lower, but generally wider limits than race cars and it's nice to squeeze performance from them.
- This will get expensive really quick. The base game is fairly priced for what it has, but if they put out content for the next 2-3 years, you might end up paying hundreds more, even if you get the season passes. DLC prices are too high in my opinion. At least there are no monthly fees, you own what you paid for.
- Still some bugs to iron out.

For me, this is the next step after Assetto Corsa that rFactor 2, Project Cars 2 and iRacing weren't. I could not get into those games for various reasons. Excited to see what this game can do a year from now.",1596480881,1614548784,True,16,0,0.644171535968780518,1,True,False,False

Personally I only really drive the Porsche GT3 and AMG GT3 and they are both very good.  The Porsche GT3 is amazing and the sound of it is probably the best sounding car in any sim.  The sound really adds to the immersion when you use this car.

Graphics:  Amazing looking game.  The post processing and shaders in this game are the best.  The sunset and sunrise is perfect and I love the shadows, etc.  The rain and thunderstorms are probably the best in any sim racing game.  For overall graphics, I will still give the edge to ACC because the textures are higher quality in ACC, but this game looks incredible.

Physics and FF:  The force feedback is very good in this game.  Currently at the time of review I have a G29 and Fanatec V3 pedals and I love the force feedback as with this hardware combo, its right there with RFactor 2.  The physics are excellent.  You don't feel quite as connected to the track as you do in RF2 or ACC but still very good.  One tip if you are having issues with oversteer in corner entry and/or exit is the rear differential preload.  At least for the GT3 cars, set this to around 330 and it will make a huge difference.  The differential settings are huge in this game.  Another tip if you like the Porsche GT3 is to put the springs as soft as they will go and put the dampers as high as they will go.  This will take care of any bouncing effect you have.  

AI:  The AI has come so far in this game and is very good now.  In qualifying, the times between cars is so small which then makes for some very tight racing.  Currently I turn the AI aggressiveness up to 90 as it seems to help with their awareness.  

UI:  The user interface is so good, if not the best.  Its right up there with ACC.  A huge benefit this has over ACC for car adjustments, they have a description for every adjustment you can make.  ACC doesn't have this so it makes it hard to remember or know what to adjust to get your car driving the way you want.  With AMS 2 they provide great descriptions so you know what adjustments will do to the car.  

Sound:  It can be a bit of a hit or miss but the guy (AC Fan/SHR Modding) that made so many great sound mods for Assetto Corsa does the sound for this game.  He is learning a new engine but cars like the Porsche GT3 are the best you will find for in cockpit sound.  Cars like the AMG GT3 have some good sounds, but still need some work.  When you find a car he really spent some time on, the sound is amazing.  I expect he will keep tweaking and sounds will get better and better.

Updates:  They are constantly updating this game and adding content which is great.  They seem like very passionate developers.

Content:  Hard to find a game with more developer content.  There are so many cars and tracks just with the base game!!!  You get your moneys worth and definitely a cheaper game to own that say RF2.  

Currently how I would rank the sims if I had to:
1.)  ACC  (IF you are a GT3 only guy and can only buy one game, get this)
2.)  AMS 2 (Really does everything well)
3.)  RFactor 2 (The tire model and physics are so good, but even the new UI is so off pace with ACC and AMS 2 and the load times are terrible!!)
4.)  Assetto Corsa (Can't beat the combo of the price and thanks to the modders the game can look great and basically any car and track can be yours.  Custom Shaders Mod, Content Manager, and SOL are a must)
5.)  RaceRoom:  Graphics are behind all of these games.  Some people love the sound but in cockpit is to synthasized for me.  The UI is pretty good, the force feedback is good, the physics aren't as good as the other titles to me, and it can get expensive having to buy individual tracks and cars.  The DTM cars are my favorite in this title. 

All these games are great but this is how I would rank them.",1612972201,1612972201,True,8,0,0.614558637142181396,1,True,False,False

After having about 35 hours with the game, all I can say is that I love, love, love AMS2!  Great variety of tracks from the classic ones like Spa to some relatively unknown but highly challenging ones like Ibarra, Ecucador.  Nice combination of both tin top and open-wheeled cars.  The combo of the track and car variety keeps the sim fresh--with something like ACC, if you get tired of GT3, well, you're done with the sim.  With AMS2, switch to a different car and try some different tracks!

Graphics are excellent and surprisingly don't seem to tax my system that much (i.e. my fans aren't screaming like they do in the F1 game).  That's where this game stands far, far above Raceoom.

The AI opponents are a lot of fun to race.  They ""try"" hard and will race you clean if you race them clean--i.e. they don't inexplicably run into you but they will keep pressing you if they are trying to pass.

I haven't tried any multi-player yet so I can't comment on that.

Every time i come back to this game i hope they have fixed these issues, but nup, added a ton more content and do NOTHING about the glitches. Real shame, i had very high hopes when i played the early access. 

Absolutely NO IDEA why they added GT3 cars to this, ACC is cheaper and does GT3 cars PERFECTLY, this does not, it is basically PC2 with a bunch of different tracks and different handling. I can only assume they expected that might give the game the kick in the arse it needed to get some players around. 

Some cars drive very well, some do not. I would hope it can all only get better, because it really can't get any worse.

Implementation of the Project Cars 2 online lobby setup was a god send for multiplayer racing fun, it works ok IF you have it set up correctly... Racing is mostly a total mess of rammers and people who dont care though. At the end of the day, hardly anyone plays it anyway, so i guess do as you like. 

The graphics and VR are dated and fake looking, theyre about the same as PC2. Great 4 years ago i guess, but certainly nothing to rave about now. Certainly no ACC, and even rF2's newer content really blows this away for graphics now. The VR will actually go to sleep if you don't move your head enough, and i had that occur during a qualifying session. 

Basically any other sim or racing game is better than this. rF2 has just as much content but costs a lot less and is significantly better. ACC is better in every single way except total content. 

I can't possibly recommend this game, and i can only assume the others that are have probably paid a fortune for the season pass and really want it to be improved. So do i, but i can't see it being the case any time soon.

The handling is mostly great, but there is some variability, especially in the GT4 (for me at least). The GT1 class is fantastic, and the GT3 class is very good.

For my setup, the FFB/handling combination is the best, beating out ACC, AC, RRE, RF2 (although those others are all great sims also). RF2 used to be on top for me, but AMS2 has nudged it out of top spot.I have a T300RS wheel and CS Elite pedals with LC.

The graphics are the best in class. I run all the sims at max at a res. of 3440 x 1440 and AMS2 is best hands down (esp. at sunrise).

Reiza regularly updates the game and go deep with them (physics, AI lately). 

The AI makes for good racing. I can't say what the online MP is like because that is not my thing.

Sims seem to be a matter of personal taste to a large extent, so your mileage may vary. To me, this one was well worth the price.",1612151389,1612151389,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Having been too and driven around a few of the U.K tracks, I am very impressed.  The choice of cars at the moment is slightly limited but the cars they have are fantastic each with different physics and a unique feel.   Each sim brings something different, this brings a whole world of immersion. I would not hesitate to recommend to those who love cars and driving, honestly don't wait.

VR : I run a Quest 2  at 1.3 @ 90 hertz , and I would say with the correct setting which if requested I will send. 
Is really spectacular probably the best in my opinion, and in the open wheeler's is just something else. the sense of speed in this sim is just perfect, PCars and other feel slow..... !

That impressed with the game, bought  the Nuburging Track Pack and a friend did the same, we were again totally blown away by the level of detail, driving following each other round lap after lap, honestly felt like we were on track day. 

Multiplayer - There are limited players, but you will never fail to find a race, and the level of racing is good with some great races had, you can create you own, with AI or Without, Vary the Weather, Force Setting if you wish. People always join and within 20 min have a full server. 

This really is WORTH a BUY..

How wrong was I.
Having read about many of the improvements over the first few months I bought the game again and it is now everything I hoped it would be.
The developers continue to push out updates to improve the car roster, handling, AI and tracks at an impressive rate - they clearly have a vision for this game and it is working.
Also, the online racing has generally clean races because most players are clearly enthusiasts.

Just 2 things I would like to see moving forwards:
1. More flexibility with modding to also include the steam workshop so mods are easier to find and install.
2. A bigger online community (although Reiza are seeing to this simply by improving the game so much).

If you are unsure about this game because of early reviews or tried it early on and refunded, now is the time to take the plunge and benefit from an amazing team of passionate developers.

Actually I thought this game was just a flavour of project cars 2 but with less cars and tracks. and since I alrady owned PC2, I ignored AMS2 till now. But it´s so much more than PC2. graphics are far nicer and I get about 20% more FPS than I do on PC2! I can finally run ultra @ 4K with my 3060 TI with 60-90 FPS. Driving is much more challenging than PC2, especially in the rain.

Pros:
- Looks and runs better than PC2 and ACC (ACC also looks great, but performance is worse).
- Funky car and track selection that you won´t find anywhere else on account of the developers being Brazilian. For example, I was delighted to find the classic VW Passat we had as I was a kid! So fun to drive too!
- Known cars and tracks being added (GT3, GT4, GT1) 
- Still being developed and improved
- Proper sim? idk,I also like PC2, I´d say this is a mix between PC2 and ACC.
- Great AI that isn´t sluggish in lap 1 like every other sim! They behave like humans,including making mistakes and batteling you and eachother for positions. Expect light contact now and then, but nothing crazy.
- AI can be added to private lobbies with friends for a fun session! just like PC2.
- Rain effects are awesome and the tracks are dynamic.
- Price is very competitve, and is a steal when on sale.
- Each car class is very different and challenging.
- Great in VR due to the better graphics and performance compared to PC2.
- It´s what I was hoping PC3 would be if SMS didn´t become completely mad.

Cons:
- Less cars to choose from compared to AC or PC2, though way more than ACC.
- Not too many people playing it online, and no one plays the more funky cars (good that we have the decent AI)
- Still being developed so things are changing and there are bugs, but the studio is very active.
- Some tracks are paid DLC (Spa, Nordschleife..etc), But I think that´s fair since they also add lots of content for free with each update.

I've really enjoyed this sim since early access.  It was a solid racer, with a few issues. 
After all of the additional development, this is now an amazing racing sim!

With all the recent updates and DLC it is now, in my opinion, head an shoulders above most other sims.  
I also race in Raceroom, Project cars 2, Assetto Corsa and love them all.  I have to add that Assetto corsa competezione is awesome, but not great in VR, and Rfactor 2 feels fantastic, but I have too many issues with it to go into here.  

This game just races well, both online and single player.  It feels amazing, looks superb in VR and has great content.  

This is my go to racer to showcase VR/sim racing to people, and never fails to impress.

Once you're sitting in a 90's open wheeler with that amazing engine sound flying up Eau Rouge flat out, wind blasting you, you'll love it i'm sure.

With the current roadmap and ongoing updates and improvements, it can only get better and better.

I avoided it until now based on other reviews because I thought it might not be the type of realistic sim I enjoy but took a chance while it was on special. Now I know for sure.

Although less than 2 hours is not a lot of time to get familiar with a driving sim I am sure I want to refund it and I do feel like I have spent enough time to be sure it's not the game for me.

I initially had problems setting it up and had to restart multiple times before it recognised my pedals. Later on FFB stopped working while I was playing so perhaps it's a bit buggy also.

VR works well and I liked that my bass shaker produced some effects just from the game without 3rd party software needed. FFB on my direct drive wheel is meh, not terrible but also not great.

This is typical if you are the type that doesn't cheat with a mod that does an auto-setup alongside an auto-drive mod to troll games, which does happen. But this isn't what bothers me.

What bothers me is why are the lobbies so bare of people? The reason is because the game is 'Track-centric', which means it focuses on the race track and nothing more. Sure the game looks nice, even from the advertisements, but the mechanics are what is screwed up. Everything has to run flawlessly for a perfect race, or at the very least be pre-planned.


A few more things;

I can't search for a race based on the car I want to drive that I spent time setting up. The safest way you can do this is setting up your own race, which gets barely any notice.

Also, if you create a set-up for your car that you want to use on every track, like the default settings that are in the game paired with every vehicle at the click of a button that you have to change, you can't. You can't LOAD a car set-up from another track. You are left with redoing your car set-up on every single track you enter, OR you are left with using the default settings which have to be changed. What horsesh!t.


There are of course bugs. Lots of them related to improper track and car placement after a car/player chooses to retire from a race, becomes damaged, or has a weak connection. This means the game doesn't take into account the negatives of a race. It only looks at the positives of a race and doesn't have a default way to correct the negatives, which every game should have built-in. 

For example, if you understeer a corner, spin-out, damage your vehicle, and decide to concede the race by pressing the ESC key and selecting 'Return to Pit Box', BUT someone already has done this, your car will be placed within the same Pit Box and then launched in to the sky eating up resources and creating latency on the server. Only one person at a time can enter the Pit Box in this fashion. Also, by design each track only has one pit box which is the default location of the spawn point of the cars for each race. Obviously there should be as many spawn points for all cars in a particular race and not just one. This is a known (and recorded) bug and it is not corrected...probably because idiots love making Youtube videos about it and getting views/clicks. 

Finally I would like to say, the game isn't broken. It's flawed, and the flaws I have noticed are listed above. It's made for casual players that are good at the game, who are expected to play for 30 minutes a week and that's it and not notice these flaws. It's not made for people who choose to play on a regular basis and push the game to it's limit, like one would do on a race track in real life. 

This game is a simulation, but very borderline on not being one based on the amount of issues I have listed as of December 30 2020, and these are only what I have listed. There are others such as crashing to desktop, and even a BSOD which happened on my very first online race with one other player, which is not a great thing while hosting with such a small community online playing. Also, a real simulation should not force a player to perform mundane tasks on every track and play absolutely perfectly on every track for the software of the game to operate correctly.

As of right now, unless you are desperate for a game with mediocre damage mechanics that are not really accurate alongside really poorly made crowd animations, go ahead and buy it. But I advise against it. Since purchase, I spent the majority of my time waiting in the multiplayer lobby looking for the race I want to race, or hosting the race I want to race, as opposed to racing in what is being raced at that time..which isn't right. So for myself, as of right now I do not recommend it because the reasons to not own are mounting each day. Unless there is a 2021 patch in the future I am unsure I am going to return.


Also one more thing that needs mentioning... This 'Simulation' doesn't recognize fuel as being a weight in the car. I can put 60L of fuel in the car without it affecting performance. That's ridiculous and makes the game look like a joke. Believe it or not I actually put 5L of fuel in the car and the car performed slower. These are problems that need addressing before people purchase this game.",1609383941,1609445743,False,17,3,0.540034234523773193,0,True,False,False

This game is getting better for sure with regular updates, although my early access price doesn't seem such a bargain when I don't think it has ever been full price and is now regularly on sale.

I got VR for Christmas and this has completely changed my view (no pun intended) of this game.  It is so immersive in VR and the sense of realism is amazing.  It's taken a long while, but I think I love this game now.

This is how the game should have been released when it came out of early access, and not the incomplete mess that was put out.

Original review:

Graphics are very nice and it seems to be well optimised.  That's as far as my praise goes at the moment.  I really want to like this game, but I don't.

At the moment the game is unfinished and broken in places despite v1 being out.  It is not a full release.  I bought early access expecting a full game upon release.  There is no championship - well there is, but you can't change the settings for it, the first race is an hour, and then you can't save your progress so if you quit after the first event to do something else, you can't go back and continue (surely this is the number one basic requirement?).  If you did a race or hotlap before starting then you start the championship in that car (F1 car against stock cars?).  There is no car sound in the in car view.  If you restart a hotlap it defaults to a certain camera angle and you have to change to the one you want every time.  There is no ranking system online so you race against idiots like Racetech who crash you out of races before either getting kicked or quitting themselves because they're just not good enough to race clean.  Online the cars glitch like crazy (I have a low ping so it shouldn't be my fault).  There is a lack of real world cars.  For a game that prides itself on physics, I find it odd that the cars are made up, and in that case, so are the physics.  People rave about the force feedback, but I don't think it is as good as RaceRoom or rFactor2.  In you find the right part at the edge of the map, you fall off it and keep falling forever. The car sounds are rubbish.  There are numerous other glitches.

[b]Gamepad[/b]: I read a review which said how good it is on the gamepad, really? No matter how I tweaked it, it felt horrible & twitchy. Now I know all those Direct Drive jockeys will scoff at it but sometimes you just want to chill on the couch and drive some laps - you can't on this.

[b]Force feedback[/b]: Everyone raving over this, I haven't driven a lot but its barely there. Granted I have an absolutely ancient wheel but AC / ACC / PCars / Dirt etc all use it fine. 

[b]Content[/b]: There's not a lot here but this is a sim and the dev's are putting more effort into tyre wear than any kind of single player campaign. But it would be nice if someone did remember the single player base and have some sort of progression system.

[b]VR[/b]: It does feel good in VR (Rift S). I get a nice sense of speed from the surroundings but its not enough to tae me away from AC / ACC to be honest.

Also, the sound is great too: you won't hear so much noise coming from the engine, the crashes, the gear shifting, etc. in any other game making AMS2 a very immersive driving experience.
If you enable all the assists and select the most newbie opponents, the game still feels more challenging and harder then Project Cars 2 with the same same settings.

But as a sim racing player its not a good game. Its got more flaws then good from what I think the game should be. 
             Lets start of with the good. Its using the unreal engine is why people say its a copy of project cars, due to the graphic. Simple mechanics on how to play the game. When booting up the game I was able to start a race and wasn't lost in the option it has. 
             Lets start of now with the negative. This game really didn't play like a sim racer It played like an arcade style racing game. Let me tell you why, First of I just heard during this time of writing this review, There were updates just released for the A.I. When I booted up the game I was really going to hope for some good A.I. racing, But the A.I. is trash to race against. Yes its nice to have aggressive A.I. but this is too aggressive where the races just look so fake and, It starts to look like the cars are there to bump you on the road to spin out. Second is this is the first time I have played a sim racing where the car I love the EVO is a front wheel drive. I am no car guy but, I know all other racing games they are all wheel drives base on the real car. Another is what makes this a bad game is slipping tires even if your going not to fast and apply your breaking the rear breaks just want to fish tail just like a drifting car would. I have near seen that in other sims making the car feel so floaty and light, So if A.I. bumps you, you will spin out and be in last place again. Button press is so late. From switching from going forward to going backward to back up your car. Also this is the first time they introduce cars that love to go on two wheels. What the hell were the programmers thinking. Another part I really don't like is the amount of cars in the game. I think roughly there is only around 25 cars. They have different categories for cars but each categories hold about 1 or 2 cars in a category are you kidding me seriously. 
               Please never ever compare this to project cars. That game is a good sim game and had alot of options and cars and weather elements and, Importantly the cars felt heavy and react like real cars. Project car is not a perfect game but, compared to this game its like your comparing University graduate programers compared to high school drop out programmers its really that bad you can see the differences in knowledge of programming and, how much the Project people knew about cars. If you see this game on full price give this game a pass. There are better sim racers out there. But if your curious on how trashy this game is and, just want to buy this game for kicks and giggles..wait for the game to go on sale. 
                This game isn't worth its price full and hope this isnt something that the programmers will abandon, due to the failure of the game. I give this right now of a score of 6/10",1609089918,1609089918,False,5,1,0.493598759174346924,1,True,False,False

For me I don't hate or have any real negative towards any sim racing game because none of them are actually ""realistic"" in the sense that most of the feedback has to be sent through FFB via the Wheel which in the real world a lot of feedback is given to the driver through other parts of the car and not just the wheel.

Each sim basically has its own interpretation of what is ""realistic"" and AMS2 is no different, for me I have felt most comfortable with iRacing in terms of the overall physics and FFB but my only problem with iRacing is I have become less of a competitive sim racer and someone that just wants to have a fun sim racing game to play against AI.

Now I primarily play in VR and so the overall experience from launching the game to the menu to actually racing, for me in VR, has to be good. Now as said with iRacing, I am not competitive so I have now stopped playing that. Assetto Corsa doesn't fully support VR in the sense that only the driving part is in VR and so I disregard that. PC1/PC2 are now quite old and the track versions plus the dated cars have made me not be that interested in them anymore. Race 07 is very old at this point and doesn't support VR.

So now we move onto ACC and rF2, which AMS2 is constantly compared to. Now both sims I have enjoyed but the problem with both is they are not well optimised for VR and for me VR is the only way I play sim racing, if both games were more optimised or at the very least ACC had graphical settings that when lowered didn't make the game look terrible, then I would honestly be playing those two sims instead of AMS2 but because of the problems with running in VR in terms of performance is why I primarily play AMS2.

AMS2 for me as someone who plays only in VR, is great! The game runs very smoothly in VR while retaining a good amount of detail and beauty to the world around you while driving. The game also does a great job of variety in both cars and tracks, I spent the other day racing the Cayman GT4 and then moved onto the Mercedes-Benz 190E DTM and then moved onto the Ginetta G58 P1 car. 

The physics and FFB are pretty darn good, I would say in terms of overall feel it is on par with iRacing. To me ACC has a more heavy FFB and rF2 seems to be much smoother with its FFB while focusing a bit more on the detail. Overall I find AMS2 very good in this area, it is one of the main reasons (aside from VR) that I moved to AMS2 as I was able to get to grips and get comfortable with the physics/FFB.

For me AMS2 isn't the best with physics/FFB, it isn't the best for just GT3 or GT4 or Formula, it isn't the best if you to race others online and it isn't the best for track selection. But what AMS2 does is be good to great at each of these to create an overall great sim racing game.

Personally if I didn't play in VR, I would probably be playing ACC or rF2 but because I play solely in VR and because of the sheer variety of cars/tracks I can choose from and the fairly challenging AI, I highly recommend AMS2 and the Reiza are always good at supporting their games and delivering new content.

One final thing I want to address is the Season Pass, now the £79.99 price is steep but if you look into what we are getting I would say it is worth it. I mean so far we have 3 new highly detailed tracks, these are $14.95 in iRacing ($44.85) and we are also due another new track with Spa plus upcoming 90's GT1 cars. On top of all that there are still further expansions, tracks and cars they have said will be coming over 2021 that are included in the Season Pass. So I would say that the price is steep but overall it is worth it in my opinion.

At the end of the day, having a large selection of sim racing games is great! The best thing as a sim racer to do is not be a fan boy or be elitist, pick the sim that you feel is comfortable for you and the one that gives you the fun + enjoyment that you are after and for me that is AMS2.",1608757239,1608757239,True,51,0,0.812883853912353516,0,True,False,False

This game is a worthy addition to any sim racer's library; I'd recommend it as a sort of change-of-pace sim to turn to when you're feeling bored of the same old same old that other sims offer. There's a lot of unusual tracks and cars to enjoy, and you'd really be doing yourself a disservice if you avoided trying out all the excellent Brazilian series featured in this game that you simply can't drive elsewhere.

THE GOOD:

- To get one thing out of the way, i am not familiar with the force feedback of this game because i do not own a full wheel setup, but even with a controller, this game allows you to have alot more confidence in comparison to project cars 2. Every car feels unique, with their own rate of tire degradation and vehicle characteristics. I would go so far as to say this is one of my favourite racing games of recent years! A particular highlight would have to be the BMW M1 pro-car, which sounds very, very close to its real life counterpart and drives like a wild animal; an animal you can learn to tame and master. The prototypes, particularly the Metalmoro AJR P1, is my personal favourite just because you can never say no to a high down-force prototype am i right?

- The variety of content within this game is honestly very diverse; i have never seen so many variations of open wheel cars so if open wheel is your thing, then go HAM!

- THE GRAPHICS! Now don't get me wrong, I would always take vehicle sounds and physics over a pretty game any day but... Considering that the Madness Engine somehow produces some of the best looking graphics for a racing game, this is no exception. As well as this, it doesn't tank your frame rate whenever you have a full grid of cars with interchanging weather so fear not if you don't have a NASA super computer as your gaming rig!

THE BAD:

- This is slightly unfair as the game is still a WIP, but the damage model for certain cars, such as the formula V12 and the classic formula cars is inconsistent (bodywork not coming off, wheels not detaching when hit)

Iv put a lot of time in to AC and started to feel like i was reaching the limit of what i could learn from it, but with AMS2 my driving has come along so far in just a few days. 

The driving feels amazing, there's a lot of depth to the force feedback, and tracks feel great too with lots of definition. the setup options are nicely done and more detailed compared to AC, but it all feels similar to PC2 in terms of menus etc. Driving wise, id say its a lot closer to RF2 and ACC. 

I like how in open wheel cars you can see the tyres deforming around bends and over bumps. watching replays you get a good sense for how to work with the car and what to tune to help you tweak your setup. and for those that are a bit apprehensive about touching setups, there are well written descriptions for all your setup options which is nice, but i think there is also a way to view other peoples setups and load them within the setup options (haven't tried it).

Its great feeling when the car come alive as it warms up and you get a genuine sense of it being your car and wanting to look after it. having to manage your brakes and engine temps is nice, it makes the longer races more interesting, especially with mechanical faults enabled, and pit stops are pretty well done too.

The only criticism i have for AMS2 is that the online isn't very populated at the moment, and i cant understand why for such a great sim! the collisions are a little strange at the moment, but to be fair the level of drivers online (for the most part) means that generally the racing is very gentlemanly so collisions are fairly rare from experience.

Sure, there are some niggles here and there, but considering its state of development and continued support from the devs, I'm sure the game could come round to being the best all-round sim for this generation, truly, it could go down as one of the great sims of history. get buying! help it get the recognition it deserves!

I had issues with using my logitech G29 not picking up the clutch pedal properly and the steering feeling really light with no force feedback. I go a refund on the game as it clearly wasnt in a playable state.

I bought this game on Black Friday as I saw it was getting constant updates, so why not give it another go. 

Set it up and noticed at first it was not recognising my G29 wheel. I unplugged the wheel and tried again. Went into wheel setup it says turn the wheel to full lock. Then hold the wheel 90 degrees to the left and your wheel will work perfectly. 

Went to load a car and went to drive a track and it was literally holding butter using the wheel  with no feel and force feedback and the steering angle was off. Changed the settings which made no difference. I then realised it was the wheel calibration system itself which is clearly left over from Project Cars 2 game. 

Respect to Reiza for introducing updates to this all the time, but when you have to make a game based off the Project cars engine which is not a racing sim your going to have major issues. Reiza should have started with their own base like in AMS1 which is a fantastic game. 

If your in the market for a good racing sim stay away and buy Assetto Corsa or Rfactor 2 or even the original AMS1.

It improved a lot over the past couple of months and Riza is banging out update after update , bringing new tracks and cars and adjusting physics and AI. Here's a list of highly subjective pros / cons:

Pros
+ one of the best force feedback systems. With my G920 you really get an idea of what the car is doing and when tires load up and eventually loose grip. On bumpier tracks I even get a good impression of the roads surface despite my low level wheel. I just love it!

+ Doesn't require a top of the line graphics card to run nicely in VR. I'm running it with a Rift (old) and a GTX1060 without any bigger drops in frame rates and yet beautiful graphics

+  Car physics: Can't really say much about that, since I've never driven an actual race car but to me it feels immersive and belivable enough although there are some cars in the game where the physics are just way off

+ You'll find a couple of race tracks you wouldn't find anywhere else. There are some really good tracks in South America bringing lots of fun and a challenging experience

+ Plenty of F1 cars from vintage 60's to late 2000's. Especially the early 90's cars are pleasure to drive and I enjoy every lap sitting in one of these highpowered cars. Something I couldn't find anywhere else

Cons:
- Speaking of tracks I still miss some of the classics. Spa will come with a DLC later, but I would love to see Monza or Le Mans :)

- Some of the cars that where in the game early on are just not enjoyable. They behave weirdly and are just unpleasant to drive. Guess it's up to you to figure out the ones you like.

- Sometimes the AI doesn't seem to be aware that you are racing close wheel to wheel. I had incidents were cars in front are breaking totally unpredictable. And after a few laps following a car you can easily find out where they would loose the time and go incredibly slow. However I have to say that the AI system improved a lot over the last releases!

- Multiplayer is currently not really existent. Just a few lobbys with a couple of drivers. I also miss a couple of features that makes other sims (AC) so enjoyable to play online. You currently can't join a running race and won't be able to start over from the pits if you mess up your car during the start of the race.

I mostly play RRRE, ACC, RF2, AC, some PC2, and AMS2.
AMS2 is one of my top 3 favorites (my other 2 favs are RRRE and ACC).

What I like about AMS2: 
[list]
[*]It's got a lot of content (cars and tracks).
[*]It's got a lot of great South American tracks not normally found in another games.
[*]It's got a lot of nice European tracks too (Donington Park, Oulton Park, Hockenheim, Silverstone, etc).
[*]The devs keep working on it, improving it, and adding content to it.
[*]The DLC is reasonably priced. For example: cheaper than RF2.
[*]The FFB feels good and I didn't have to spend much/any time tweaking it; it felt good right out of the box.
[*]Good performance (for example: tracks load a lot quicker than RF2).
[*]Looks good.

My main game is ACC. ACC offers great graphics, good physics and many events - be it sprint races or long distance races.

But after nearly 2 hours in this game I have to say that FBB is more precise and accurate than in ACC.
The steering wheel gives you much more feedback.

All in all the game is a very well done package and is constantly updated. With a few small changes the sim can become very successful. The vehicle selection is already really great.

Graphics = Ok but really dated looking with oversaturated colours making it look almost cartoon like.
FFB = i really like the force feedback here, even with my humble belt driven wheel i can feel exactly what the car is doing (something acc lacks a touch) and you can catch slides, which is just as well given the comedy physics at times.
Physics = All over the place really, some cars feel really good where others feel like there are dinner trays under the rear wheels, i hate the brakes, on most cars they lock up far too easily (you may fair better than me here with load cell pedals idk) some cars just don't feel as finished as others.
The absolute worst is the collisions, you either stick to the other car or one of you goes flying in the air like a kite, had a race recently where i got punted upside down, the game would not let me reset the car because ""i was too close to other cars"" wtf?
Track selection is good, with some brazilian tracks you might not find on other sims.
No driver licence so no real penalty for driving like a dick.
Multiplayer is completely dead, your lucky to find a lobby with more than 5 players.

Overall i couldn't bring myself to recommend this game when there are far superior sim racers out there, i had high hopes as the game certainly has potential but as it has been out of beta for so long and they are selling paid dlc's now its clear that this is as good as its going to get, its clear rieza cant fix the buggy pc2 engine.",1603311075,1605463628,False,5,0,0.518279731273651123,0,True,False,False

Reason- Devs update regularly and address issues. All of those listed below have been addressed in the latest update and the FFB, AI and overall presentation is such that I for one look forward to the ongoing development of this title with much increased optimism.

FFB- was notchy and didnt tell me much of what the vehicle was doing. Now is incredibly tactile, especially under braking. Possible the best Ive ever experienced out of AC, ACC, PC2 with Jack Spades custom files. Truly feels wonderful. (G920)

Technically, it runs and looks great. The engine succeeds here, good job
Content wise, a nice selection of cars and tracks not usually represented in other sims; bonus!
How that content is monetized; no problem, they have to keep the ship sailing...

Now where does it fall short?

Is the racing as fun and engaging as its competitors in the genre?; No I wouldn't say so, ai is a work in progress. Also, I have no idea when the car is 'on the limit' which is the whole point here...
Does the car's attitude translate well to the wheel? Not for me, it needs alot of work when stacking up to RF2 and even Assetto Corsa. Very little information regarding where the car's grip level is and what the rear end is doing. That for me is forcefeedback's biggest virtue and this title leaves me guessing far too much. It's all suspension travel, which feels odd in a GT3 car when comparing to how other sims handle this force
Is there a compelling reason to keep playing day after day? No, not for me at this time, as I enjoy a career simulation as well...
So I check in from time to time, and test out new updates and content. My expectations are tempered because it's a work in progress. I'm giving it a thumbs up for the effort they've clearly put in so far and where I believe it's heading

- Car behavior is not bad, inconsistent across car models. Some feel ""great"" and some others are deceiving and not really natural even if we can clearly feel the road connection. Breaking in general feels a bit weird, too soft, would benefit some more resolution.
- Good number of cars to choose from. But no popular licensed brands (ex: Road cars, Supercars, GT series etc.). Besides Ginetta, looks like all cars are brazilian related brands and some of those look like toys.
- AI is kind of good depending on situation, with some strange behavior. Seems to have some PC2ish influence (can't tell for old AMS, never played)
- Graphics: 3/5 (looks nice, but ""unpolished"")
- Sound: 2/5 (road effects and stereo separation effects feel ""unpolished"", crashes sound awful)

I only race in VR mode and This the part where AMS2 really shines. It's so immersive and driving at Interlagos during sunset and sunrise and it even gives me goosebumbs, it's just beautiful. But it's such a shame that this sim has no career mode and ranked multiplayer. I play mostly in ACC because of this. Downside of ACC is the worse VR capability but the game is so much more engaging. Also the car handling of AMS2 is more forgiving for my driving style so after playing AMS2 for a while makes me more careless resulting in more mistakes in ACC after switching to this title. 

When AMS2 gets a career mode and a ranked mulitiplayer option I would fire it up more often. This sim has so much potential, I hope they will make it more engaging, I'm sure it will be a huge success!

If you're into hardcore sim racing games, it doesn't offer much that the likes of rFactor 2 and Assetto Corsa can't do better with the help of mods. But what it does do is create an out-of-the-box racing experience that blows both of those ageing sim racing juggernauts out of the water. If you like tinkering and installing countless mods, those two games will serve you better. But if you can't be bothered with all that finicky crap, and having to navigate an atrocious UI in the process, AMS 2 will delight you much more. It has so many little quality-of-life improvements over other sims that it's hard for me not to be irritated when I play one of those more established titles again. It's also super easy to set up a custom online game for you and your friends right from within the game. There is a dedicated server tool as well, should you want to configure a standalone server.

It's still in active development, and as such, it still has many bugs. But it also has a lot of heart. If you have experienced Reiza's previous games, you know what they're capable of. So far, I've been very impressed with every new piece of content they released for free, and I finally decided that it's time to buy the Premium Track Pack so I can race on Hockenheim, Silverstone, and the newly-released Nürburgring GP track.

The F1 cars are all fantastic, with the Formula V12 and Formula V10 Gen. 2 being my favourites. The BMW Procar is another standout car. And now it has its first batch of GT3 and GT4 cars, allowing you to stage your own World Endurance Championship. It's quite spectacular to set up a race with accelerated time scale to simulate racing through the night, and to then load up the grid with LMP1, LMP2, GT3, and GT4 cars.

Even though it came out as a full release a few months ago already, it's clear it should have stayed in early access for much longer. The game is simply not feature complete still. Things that are still missing:

1) Career mode.
2) Custom championships (you can do a championship, but only one out of three pre-made ones)
3) No ranking or safety rating in the multiplayer (or lack of any structured multiplayer)

So at the moment you are forced to either do single races against AI, or race in random public lobbies. And honestly I can't decide which is worse. 

AI is some of the worst I've seen in any sim. First of all they are completely inconsistent in regards to their skill, depending on the track / car combo. There are some combos where I have to put them as low as 70-80 to match their pace, whereas with other tracks / cars I can crank them up to 120 (maximum) and I will still be 2-3 seconds a lap faster than them. In short - have fun spending a ton of time trying to find the proper AI level to match you. Moreover their speed can vary greatly depending whether it's practice / quali / race. I had races where I was barely able to match AI speed in quali, only to be a second a lap faster than them in the race. 

But let's say you finally manage to find the proper AI level to race them. Great? Nope! No at all. The AI is absolutely hopeless when it comes to racing you. They are unable to make proper defending / attacking moves. Often they just completely disregard your presence and will happily ram you off the road. 

So, AI is unusable, so let's try MP shall we? Find one of the barely populated servers and then pray that the session will actually work... here are the things that may go wrong before you manage to get into a race:

1) you may join the lobby but it won't let you join the actual session (the join button is stuck at 'waiting')
2) you join the practice / quali, but the host decides to leave / forgets to advance to the next session
3) the host may still be there, but the game will decide to break and won't allow the host to advance the session unless they leave their own server

I often had to spend 15-30 minutes jumping from server to server to finally get any sort of race going...

Any experienced simmer knows how the racing is in random public lobbies, however. People of questionable skill, and manners, rammers and all the people lagging, oh god, the lag is just terrible. Cars are jumping all over the road, sometimes driving sideways. 

Of course, there are things that are good about this game. There is a great variety of content, both cars and tracks. A lot of stuff you won't be able to experience in other sims. I especially liked the classic formula cars and tracks. Many of them drive, sound and feel great. FFB is OK on my CSL Elite. I don't really have any problems with the driving part of the sim. Graphically it also looks pretty good. 

But every time I fire up AMS2 I just find myself wondering, what the hell am I supposed to do in this game? All these great cars and tracks, but no actual game! AI racing is terrible, public lobbies are usually just as bad. All you are left with is hot lapping I guess. If you are fine with just trying out different cars on different tracks, racing against the clock, you may find it fun. But if you want to RACE, then don't buy this.",1604254804,1604254804,False,73,5,0.674217939376831055,9,True,False,False

GT3/GT4/GT5 cars are in as of Halloween 2020 along with an updated tire model and FFB update with a new damper slider. You can now feel a difference in the bounce of the car through the stiffness(or softness) of the suspension. Feel it hit the bump stops. I'm on a G29 playing in VR. 

This is a good looking and smooth playing game siding heavily on the side of simulation. It may not be at the pinnacle of the modern masters but this is still well above AC and even RF2(in dx11 mode) in terms of jankiness on my system at least, specs coming below.

Plenty of cars and tracks here to get to know. There is an emphasis on South American tracks and cars but the variety is top shelf for out of the box. The DLC track roster is getting better every update by the looks of it, I'm still getting into this but the AI is only second to rFactor 2 in my opinion. I enjoy endurance racing so I'll set up 30-50 lap races with some tunes and get my race on. AMS2's AI will defend their line and attack yours pretty cleanly if you give them room and the aggression slider isn't set to 666. I have 156hrs in RF2(Best AI), and 174hs in AC(worst AI). 

Graphics are great with my 3200G/RX570-4GB/16GB@2600/860evo in VR(Acer WMR). This isn't a console port so you have full advanced graphics and control mapping ability. FFB setup is straight forward unlike the PC series dumpster fire of a settings menu. I've been running and drawing a 15 car grid and it feels smooth compared to the ten max with rf2/ac(and needing to limit only being able to see 4 cars at one time with those two games respectively with my setup).

The soundscape is top notch as well. Lumpy V8s or Screamy V12 to I4s sound authentic with some amazing downshift backfires that don't sound like an add-on effect. Very nice directional sound to hear cars around you. Did I mention the mirrors in VR? Sorry, it really is a step up in realism that the mirrors don't look like a classic camera screen that doesn't do shit. Side mirror, the center mirror, even the other side mirror all behave like they should when you move your head forward/back/side/side. Sorry to harp on, it really is a wild feature you have to see for yourself.  

So definitely get this on sale but it's still worth the regular price for the amount and quality of the content and the graphics quality of the game overall. Especially if you are a VR player. If you are a new racer AMS2 does have all the standard helper assists along with LIVE on-track racing lines that update the red braking zones depending on your speed! AC's painted on static ""driving lines"" always looked like crap and bugged me to no end trying to learn a new track as a beginner. 

A few ending notes. There is no official mod support. But that also means you don't have to sift through years of old broken or half finished mods ripped from other games using a standard copy/pasted car config. Looking at you for that rf2 >_>... there are mods but you need to decompress your game files and do that no playing online dance. Not sure of the uncompressed size if you wanted to do all that I thought you should know its an option and maybe have have second instance installed for online if you really have to do both but with no DLC the folder is 37.5GB on my drive. 

You can force the AI to do a mandatory pit stop plus you can set up multi-class races. Hard to find those features eh. Full Day and Night cycles with a speed multiplier is nice if you want to race into the night from the late afternoon in a 10 lap race. There's cycling rainy weather options too. :)

Reiza has proven since AMS2's EA launch in April that they are committed to developing the sim further and further for a while to come, and it shows in the massive progress that's been made. I can't make a comparison to AMS2's Madness-engined cousin Project CARS 2, but compared to Assetto Corsa and rFactor 2 (the two other staples of my sim collection), the force feedback and handling model are great. VR performance is excellent; I can easily achieve 90fps with my system even with a high number of AI along with excellent loading times while more than looking the part, while rF2 will sometimes bring my system down to asynchronous 45fps. This is a great departure from the abomination in this regard that is Assetto Corsa Competizione. Moreover, the VR user experience is great. None of Assetto Corsa's mix between monitor and headset with none of rF2's rough edges.

 I believe that the sim is well worth buying into at its current price, though I'm a bit hesistant to commit $80-90 to the 2020-2021 DLC pack before we have more concrete details.

Initial experience is still a little confusing, with a somewhat dense (and semi-duplicated) class structure seemingly still remaining from the Beta and the carryover of no warnings whether a lobby will be playable when you're in the main browser, or if they're in the four minute session changeover zone (no explanation for which is offered in-game). 

But, as soon as you get on track, none of it matters! Game physics are exceptional and a great selection of content I, and many of my friends, had no idea existed, much less had had opportunity to drive in a game. Very easy to lose hours just playing ten minute races in unlikely combinations and having the best time of your life. Default setups are also very good in almost all car/track combinations, meaning that only minor tweaks are needed to suit a style, rather than comprehensive overhalls that have been needed in some games!

I won't talk about the content in the game currently as the content (outside of lack of mod support, which is itself an issue) but the main issue is the physics. It is clear that this game engine is built for controllers as steering with a wheel is odd to say the least, steering input doesn't matter until a certain amount is reached and then the cars suddenly start to turn, problem is they then turn too much and it leads to one of the worst experiences i've had in any racing game with steering wheel support i've ever driven. That says something when Codemasters are around and making racing games but at least you can drive those cars.

As to be expected the game looks good, with fantastic wet weather, night and lighting effects but unfortunately the game is just a polished turd in terms of driveability and enjoyment with a wheel, perhaps it is different for those with controllers and it's not bad a ""sim"" but AMS2 from a driving stand point is a massive, massive let down from AMS1.",1603441304,1603441304,False,3,0,0.475174814462661743,0,True,False,False

Automobilista 2 could be the successor to Project Cars 2 we've hoped to get, and that's not far off since they use the Madness Engine and lots of other resources from Slightlymad Studios (RIP).
The car classes lean heavily towards Brazilian competitions given the developer's origin, but it ads a refreshing variety to the game. Reiza's interpretations go further via (mostly) unlicenced F1 cars, V8's from down under, and much more.
Overall, I'm enjoying the game a lot, but there is one critical fault that makes many classes for me basically unplayable: The brakes. I've tweaked my controller according to recommended settings and still, braking not even that hard results in many cars completely losing the rear end and sending you off track. This is especially frustrating with the Super V8's if you want to set a quick lap in the Australian tracks. It's maddening and I hope that Reiza can address this as soon as possible.

The best way I can describe this game is basically RF2 with current gen graphics and a Brazilian Motorsports skin. 

FFB - The FFB is excellent!..easily a close 2nd to RF2. Tyre FFB is very similar to RF2 once you get your wheel setup properly. I would say that overall it's only slightly less detailed than RF2, but once your settings are dialed in, it feels wonderful and very connected. You can pretty easily tell where the limit is and as long as your technique is good, it's relatively easy to control (depending on the car). A lot of the cars in the game do not have power steering IRL and AMS2 does a superb job in providing FFB that simulates cars w/o power steering. 

Physics - Again, very close to RF2. There are some cars which do still need some work (some of the Copa cars imo), but I'd say 80% of the cars are feeling pretty competent as of this review. One thing that stands out in this game is how much grip the tires provide when driving with good technique...if your technique is good, the car has insanely realistic grip, but if your technique is poor, it's going to be a bit less forgiving than AC or ACC. 

Graphics - Overall it is a very great game from a visual standpoint. The color palette used is very tame and tries to simulate real life as truly as possible. It is not as graphically flashy as ACC nor is it graphically superior in any way, but it's very honest and realistic. Imo, it kind of reminds me of GTR2 but with current gen graphics.

Virtual Reality - I had to add this in here because I think this is where the game truly shines! Nobody really talks about AMS2 and it's beyond stellar VR quality and that's a real shame, so I'll do it justice by talking about it myself. AMS2 is by FAR the BEST VR racing experience that can be had at this time, without a doubt! AC (modded) is pretty close and perhaps a little more graphically flashy, but AMS2 in VR borders on feeling like real life more than any other sim I've raced in VR. The AA in the game does a really solid job in cleaning up the pixels (ACC -- looking at you...) while still being very crisp and clear. The interior of the cars are amazing and the clarity of all the details inside are amazing. Additionally even other opponent cars look great. I could go on and on about how amazing it is, but if I had to sell this game to someone, I'd wager the VR experience would be enough to make most sim racers buy it, it's just THAT good!

The selection of cars and tracks is reasonable so far, but nowhere near the amount in AMS1 yet.
I'm not particularly a fan of sims that hide the best tracks behind DLC paywalls though - Hockenheim, Nurburgring, Silverstone etc) but what can you do ?

The graphics and shaders look alot more modern than the original too.

I still slightly prefer Project Cars 1, but that's probably because i've put alot more hours into that, and i'm certainly in the minority there.

Should you buy AMS 2 if you already own AMS 1? Today, this is an absolute yes!

Also, the multiplayer aspect of this title is getting better all the time. 

What sets AMS 2 completely apart for me personally is that the FFB is in another league to any other title available on the market, but there is a caveat here.

Apparently these cars actually exist but many look like fantasy cars. There are (from the top of my head) 6 karts, 8 open wheels, a couple of caterhams and some seventies style stock cars. The remaining few are g3/gt4 like, some drive like shit, some are proper, but selecting a car is usually a gamble.
  And while I appreciate all these new Brazillian tracks, a few familiar tracks such as Monza or Spa are dearly missed. Until the DLC comes out ofcourse.

If you enjoy sim racing, I highly recommend considering it, as it's an excellent title, with a great feel to it, even with budget hardware (I'm using a G29 wheel). As a result, I uninstalled 2 other racing games, as this easily surpasses those (in my opinion).

The driving and physics feel better then Project Cars 2 and a bit more realistic. The force feedback I would say feels a bit better as well. It sits for me, in terms of it's overall experience between Project Cars 2 and Assetto Corsa.

The graphics and Audio
The graphics look pretty damn good. Especially it's weather patterns and time cycles. The cars are a bit of a mixed bag. Some look extremely well done while others look super generic and low quality. The tracks however all look pretty well done. This game so far in my opinion is one of the better running and looking. Seeing the windswept rain pelt your car and face and get kicked up by cars is really exhilarating. The audio sounds a bit poorly mixed. Some sounds are fair to good like the engines. Tyre grip and impacts sound pretty low quality. Overall though it looks and sounds fairly good. It runs very well whether on a monitor or in VR.

Controls/FFB/Physics
I feel like these elements are also a bit all over the spectrum. Some cars felt great and spot on to how they feel in other sims like their P1-P4 class LMP style cars or the older Formula cars. Lots of the other car physics felt a bit all over the spectrum though. None however felt bad. The physics in general felt better, though very similar to Project Cars. Just with a much greater emphasis on realism bringing the engine closer to a true simulator like Assetto Corsa. The force feedback on my G29 felt better than Project Cars. I am excited to try the Fanatec CSW here when i get it. Being on the G29 there are not a whole lot of details to begin with. What is there though felt ok and I was able to quickly correct for over steer in a stock car and felt the bumps in the road and some of the car impacts. The rumble strips are pretty weak though. Everything does feel a little dull though. The Tyre grip is the most pronounced and that is the most important part. The G29 has a horrible brake in general but I was always able to set it well in most games to avoid the aggressive curve at the end of the travel but in this game it felt really bad and very inconsistent. It has a set of presets for button layouts and for a variety of wheels; but when I clicked on one for the G29 it didn't actually apply any of the buttons and I ended up just setting them myself.

AI
The AI in this game is pretty awful in some ways and pretty good in others. Sometimes it rails me right of the road in the middle of a slow turn. Other times it is sitting right next to you through a set of tight corners as you battle for the next position. It is also something that is rather inconsistent. At a certain point of difficulty the AI becomes a bit too difficult to keep up with. This is something I have only started to experience as I continue to progress and seen in some of the single races. I set the AI to 90 and it carries way more traction and grip through turns then I think you as the player can actually maintain at the same speed. My setups were getting me pretty good times. Not record breaking but not bad either. I was able to keep consistent lap times with good grip and high speeds but at a certain point I just wasn't able to keep up. I have noticed a few sim youtubers comment on this and I can say now for sure that it is definitely a thing. 

Online
It's mostly dead for me here in the US. There are maybe a few lobbies going at any given time. Never full, mostly just one or two players. I can't really say what its like other then the people I did play with the few times I could were much friendlier, better and cleaner drivers then I have ever experienced in an open lobby on a racing game.

DLC
It's expensive, but it is adding a lot to the game. Having a fair few tracks and a fair amount of cars in each of its releases for the price is better then one car or one track for the same price. I would rather spend the $130 US i did for the game and it's season pass (obviously I did,) then pay for subscriptions or a $60 plus $15-30 for individual cars and tracks any day. While the whole game isn't cheap, it is certainly a better deal then most of these games. It's a monetization system that i am ok with.

I think with more time and effort this game could be fantastic. It is as other have said a niche game within a niche genre. It's focus on Brazilian cars and tracks makes it an outlier. The tracks are unfamiliar and cars a little different. What's here though feels good. It runs and looks amazing in VR. It for me fits right where I want it. Its right in between being just a typical simcade like Project Cars and being an actual sim like Assetto Corsa and ACC. I like that it has a better variety of cars compared to the F1 games and ACC, and I like that it's more of a sim than Project Cars or Forza and the like. I really have enjoyed this game so far and I hope people will start playing it more. It's a genuinely fun experience and is a great VR experience. I think it's a good place to start a venture into sim racing. It has more realism than other games like PC, F1, Forza, Gran Turismo; But it's also a bit easier to get into as a sim than ACC and iRacing and the like. Its a good game and despite some of the bad like the AI or some of car physics not feeling quite that great I still think this game is worth it.

AI is behaving better after latest hotfixes but there is still room for improvement. Main problem is inconsistent speed between qualifying and race.

Brazilian Stock Cars are an absolute blast to drive and possibly the most fun I've ever had in a racing title. Throwing them around tracks such as Interlagos, Bathurst, Imola.. pure bliss. These are the main beef here with official liveries and all the tracks in the calendar. Most are completely new to me which adds to the value. You can race Spa and Monza in pretty much any other game.

There is a championship mode but unfortunately you can't customize it or create your own. I'm pretty sure this was on the list of upcoming features and something I feel is an obvious setback at the moment. While the racing itself is fun, there aren't enough game modes to support it.

Online works fine but is unfortunately quite dead. I hope it gets more crowded. 

If you are looking for a great racing simulator with unique content, this is 100% a buy. Reiza really knew what they were doing when choosing the Madness engine.

+ FFB is very good
+ Brazilian Stock Car series is awesome
+ Official brazilian racing series such as endurance prototypes, sprintrace, stock car

+ Daylight performance is very good, runs well with older computers too

I'd say this sim is worth a buy if you exclusively want to try brazilian cars and tracks at better quality than assetto corsa mods in offline mode. Other than that is is not a recommended from me. 
These days, good physics is not enough for simulator to become successful. Currently ams2 for multiplayer is almost dead, the only way to race multiplayer with more than 2-3 opponents is SRS (sim racing system), they are hosting scheduled races but even then there are usually ~10 opponents on track per race. 
I know reiza is very small studio but the season pass is absolutely nuts, 90€ for unconfirmed content... Thats a price for AAA fully fledged game with all the content and that ""gold edition"" or whatnot...
 Interestingly in steam it got very positive review score but if you check how many there are concurrent players, its 220 on 24-hour peak, thats really really small population. 
For example raceroom experience has around 820 players, assetto corsa 1 - 5000, assetto corsa competezione - 3700... Lets compare this to assetto corsa competezione release, when it launched at alpha state version 0.1 with only 1 track and 1 car it already had 300 players on average and it progressively, with some fluctuation, got more and more players. 
In my opinion ams2 had to stick strictly with brazilian content while improving other things more like multiplayer or that god awful championship mode or AI. Now they are committed on releasing new content at that insane price while they have many things improving on the base game itself. 
I really hope we will see similar trajectory of ACC for AMS2, as i love hardcore simulators but in all honestly i cannot see this simulator to be groundbreaking or extremely successful in its unique perspective  like acc is.

Now for ffb, its kinda okay on my t150 wheel, recently racing gineta at donington i found it decent but having strange ruberband effect and because of that im constantly guessing what is the limit of this ginetta, it feels that its constantly sliding throughout the corners when you try to push it on the limit.

graphics and performance: No complaints about either of them, i manage to run this game on lowest settings at 11520x2160 resolution(triple 4k resolution) at around ~40fps which is very nice considering i have gtx 1070 at the moment, for full specs check my profile.

I will follow ams2 closely and im gladly willing to change/update this review to thumbs up if updates will make it this sim worth a buy. Currently as i said if you are interested exclusivelly in brasilian content, racing hotlaps or with AI(even though it needs loads of polishing) its decent buy, but i feel this needs a lot, i mean A LOT of work before its worth checking out for most sim racing fans.",1595526038,1595526136,False,89,10,0.671687006950378418,6,True,False,False

- FFB and physics are fantastic with custom FFB. Miles ahead of PC2, especially FFB. But you have to use custom ffb, look up in reiza forum. Out of the box ffb is decent but lifeless.

- VR support performance is similar to PC2, it is the same engine. Again like in PC2 you need custom sharpening in xml. Google it, easy to find and takes a couple seconds.
- Interior is optimized for non-VR. Terrible interior design for most cars, sequential cars often do not even have gear... It is EA, so it is acceptable. Cars were ported probably from AMS1

Edit at 1.0.3: I accepted the issues in early access. The release version is very unfinished, the cars are mostly fast ports without any quality in mind. 

They want you to pay full price for terrible everything except tracks, physics ffb. Most cars are worse than most free mods.

The Championship is a basic vs AI mode that gets old pretty fast and you really have no reason to play it after completing it a couple of times. Aside from that you can create a custom vs AI race. Aaaaaand... thats about it for the AI side of things.

You have a Time Trial mode where you just well, set a lap time for others to beat. Straight forward.
And then you have Test Day. This is where i spend most of my time as a beginner learning the tracks. Its practise mode with a fancier name. 

I havent touched multiplayer much outside of trying it a couple of times. As far as i can tell its also very basic. There is no safety rating at the moment so you can end up having your race ruined by trolls. There is also no entry barrier to races due to there being no rating system so you could have complete beginners in your race who might be slamming into you. Its literally just basic lobbies that anyone can join. Not much there.

If you are a sim racing veteran you would probably play AMS2 pretty sparingly because it wouldnt take much time for you to get the cars and tracks down and there being very little content in terms of modes and most importantly, multiplayer being in the basic state that its in. 

So why am i recommending this sim?
Im recommending this sim on the grounds that it might end up being really good once there is more content added and multiplayer being heavily expanded upon with safety ratings, rankings etc.
If you are a beginner like me and you are interested in sim racing then this is a great one to pick up since its new and will only get better as time goes.

I find the fwd handling especially interesting compared to assetto corsa, you can actually lift off oversteer them.

Avid Iracer in vr, triples and most recently super ultrawide solo....oval/dirt oval and love the game. It is great.

Then I played ACC which the feel of game blew my mind and made me rethink Iracing was king. But ACC needs space shuttle to run it but man it is top notch.

Then I got Automobilista 2......this is the best racing experience I have ever had in vr and in terms of balance and feel. The on/off throttle performance is untouchable in this game. And the steering /ffb is right up there with ACC. I have never played a game in VR that felt so amazingly balanced and all around fun and like I was in control of car 100%. Iracing is too twitchy and at times gives the feeling you are driving against some penalizing physics code vs gas/brake/wheel. Automobo feels like a true to life game where your throttle, brake and steering inputs makes you the driver and not some bs code. Dont get me wrong I love Iracing and no one does oval/dirt oval like iracing. 

5 thumbs straight up for this game. I have yet to get online and have not run any races that required pit stops and have not messed with any setups yet. This is how I feel after 3-4 hours of pure fun racing.

The VR mode has a nicely-polished menu system, and unlike Assetto Corsa, this game actually recognizes your steering wheel and applies correct settings to it.

Driving the car they feel very inconsistent throughout the content both cars and tracks. Some feel ok and others need a lot of work. Also with the audio as some cars sound ok to good and others sound like when you put a pot plant card on the spokes of your pushbike. 
Menu system layout seems ok but I find myself constantly pressing the wrong menu selection and going back and forth a few times.
I have read and viewed quite a few positive mentions of the force feedback but I have to disagree. In many cars the FFB is either way to high and heavy and in others virtually non existent. I have tried to adjust the settings to find that sweet spot but any moderate adjustment seems to foul it up even worse, if a car feels too heavy then it becomes too light and so on.
The graphics are definitely an improvement over PCars2 but still not up scratch and other titles such as Assetto Corsa, ACC and iRacing are better.
Also whats the go with purchasing the Season pass if you purchased the early access version? Do I really need to spend another $125 when $135 buys the base version with the season pass? Im not sure I am understanding this correctly..

Is it a subjective impression that is based on career system, graphics, driving experience and physics and implementation of the online mode. The announcement of Project Cars 3 without pit stop, tire wear and focus and a changed career system shocked me to say the least. Reason enough to give Automobilista 2 a chance.

I was not disappointed. The game is based on the same graphic engine that was used for PC2. Despite a few old, it is  still a real eye-catcher. The driving physics has benn copied, also very good. Assuming a certain affinity for cars and car racing far from the mainstream, this is just as fun as PC2. Sometimes even more. Why? Precisely because the cars are different and can therefore be driven differently, the racing series are different. And my experiences on the online servers have been very positive so far. Good, clean races, so far no crashkids  .... It feels like the VR implementation is better. My HP Reverb keeps having tracking problems with PC2. not yet with AM2.

What I don't like is the career system. That is simply better with PC2. I also don't like the penalty system in both games. A mandatory braking in the online race just because you were briefly in the gravel bed is not so tingling.

A lot of hype in recent times has led me to this program. I was under the influence that the feedback physics were of the best in sim racing. This however, is entirely untrue. There is no feel from curbs, only barely in corners when the suspension and tires reach peak load/bind. Tracks are not representative of their real life counterparts. I've been on four tracks that are featured in this game in real life and have noticed that a number of sections are not accurate. Vehicle/track sounds (engine, gearbox, grass, tires, etc.) all have no transition between them, leading to a very binary quality. Also having a binary feel are the gearboxes. Every H pattern vehicle feels like it has a sequential, and vice versa. This is not what I expected from Reiza, given the amount of time that has been implemented into making this program.

That was the general consensus when they let us know that Automobilista 2 would be sporting the Madness Engine, from the Project C.A.R.S franchise. It was expected that they’d go for the new IsiMotor engine from rFactor 2, which is considered by many as the most accurate simulator out there in terms of raw physics, aerodynamics, ambient simulation (how the climate interferes with the track and car and so on). Yet they went with a rather questionable option, derived from Need for Speed Shift, a simcade at best, which also defines the pCARS franchise. Could it be that Reiza wanted to broaden their public and adopt an arcadey approach? Or maybe they would try and build a solid simulator out of it? After 30 hours of tinkering with all the content and under different weather conditions, I can safely say it’s the latter. And it doesn’t surprise me one bit.

To understand why it’s not a surprise to me, we need to go back in time, before  the likes of Assetto Corsa and even Automobilista for that matter: 2013. That was when the then crowdfunded Project Cars had its first public builds to supporters. It was - back then - a full blown simulator, eventually dumbed down to fit the arcade agenda and sell more copies. SMS wanted money, and the simracing niche wouldn’t be able to splash enough cash. By catering to a wider audience, they could get a lot more copies sold, thus making a lot more money. Reiza, on the other hand, could care less about the money. They know very well that the mainstream public would rather watch paint dry than buy a game that features obscure brazilian racing series. If it doesn’t have Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Porsches, world renowned tracks, they don’t even bat an eye. And even so, Automobilista 2 is a thing. Which proves, once and for all, that it’s a love testament rather than a wannabe blockbuster.  And what a love testament it is! By embracing the rather different and unique brazilian categories and tracks, Reiza brings something “new”* to the table. It’s all about the love for motorsports. 

With amazing visuals, informative FFB, realistic tyre deformation physics and above the average sounds, Automobilista 2 made its way into the absolute pinnacle of racing simulation. Reiza did an amazing job with the rF1 engine* (Automobilista 1) and made sure to do it again with MADNESS. Despite being labeled as a bootleg pCars by many (wrongly, of course), it has nothing in common with the previous other than the graphics engine and a few UI elements which are eventually going to be replaced. It drives and sounds completely different. If anything, Automobilista 2 is the Project CARS that people wanted to see in 2013/2014. The simulator that didn’t happen to see the light of the day. Reiza could care less about millions of copies sold and pleasing the mainstream market with dumbed down physics. The community was desperate for a proper next-gen sim - VR compatible - and they duly delivered. A sim from racing lovers to racing lovers.

Therefore, you should be wondering why haven’t you bought it yet rather than if you should buy it. It’s absolute madness.",1593888742,1593888742,True,140,7,0.89434283971786499,22,True,False,False

As far as sims go, I've played them all, dating back to the old Geoff Crammond and Papyrus games, through Live for Speed, to the current: AMS, Assetto Corsa (+ ACC), iRacing (though I don't own it for financial/commitment reasons), Project Cars 2, Raceroom and rFactor 2.

So where does Automobilista 2 (AMS2) sit within this sphere?

Well let me say this, it's my favourite of the bunch to drive in. Especially in VR, the combination of the solid visuals and performance from the Madness engine, to the outstanding force feedback and general handling and feel of the vehicles, I don't think I've ever had such a detailed experience from a racing game. Just getting in and driving a car (particular highlights for me being the Ultima GTR and the V8 Supercar) is a thrilling experience and the closest I've come in a game to feeling like I'm really driving a race car. Without VR, it's still excellent, though I think VR adds more to AMS2 than other similar games as it really enhances the feedback you get as a driver. It performs significantly better than Project Cars 2 using the same hardware.

That doesn't mean it's the best all round game, though. The AI is still lacking, particularly at race starts, and often feels like you're playing alone. It's not Gran Turismo bad, but Project Cars 2 and especially it's prequel AMS do the job much better.
The content also isn't as exciting. Whilst there's a selection of UK MSV tracks, and international circuits such as Adelaide, Bathurst and Interlagos, a lot of the circuits will be unrecognisable to the European and North American markets as they're focused on Brazilian or more broadly South American series. There's no GT3 cars and currently a limited pool of recognised cars available, alongside some imitations.

With that unfamiliar content does come a fresh new challenge though - getting up to speed with new cars and circuits, particularly when you find gems like Ibarra (Autódromo Internacional José Tobar) from Ecuador - can be great fun. There's also lots of pipeline content planned too, from Porsches to Spa. And if the developer fulfils their promise of regular updates as delivered in early access, it's in safe hands.

If you're somebody who wants a packed career mode or the ability to pick your favourite car and track immediately, this isn't the game for you. But for those like me who enjoy the sandbox experience and thrill of driving, AMS2 will offer you an unrivalled experience.",1593696366,1593696516,True,2,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

A fantastic sim with a wide variety of different cars and tracks, and a focus on the driving experience. Consistently high quality in all areas and a long term future development roadmap makes this a great sim to add to your collection. If you've got a wheel (or VR rig), you can't go wrong with this. 

The Brazil and South American content is pretty unique, and with contemporary and historical content from around the world there is sure to be something that clicks with you. I started sim racing back in '98 with GPL, and though I've dabbled with others nothing since has given me the same delight until I tried AMS1. AMS2 is shaping up to be my next go to sim. It is that good.

Edit: I've noticed some day one complaints in the forums so want to clarify, this is not the driving game for everyone. Simulators are long life games which people tend to stick with year over year as they get extended, tweaked and refined by the dev and community. They are such complex games that they tend to have flaws and rough edges that get overlooked by enthusiasts as refinement and growth improves them over that lifecycle. If you don't have the have the time and temperament for that AMS2 is not your driving game... yet.

The foundation they have made here has been highly focused on a good ffb wheel driving experience, and barring differences in personal taste they have pretty much nailed it for release. Nice to have stuff for more casual racers though such as championships etc are still rudimentary, and the realism is probably too high for it to be comfortable to drive with a gamepad. 

So if you want a sim you will likely not be disappointed, but if you want a casual racing game, maybe not so much.",1593594276,1593645129,True,11,0,0.615481257438659668,0,True,False,False

I would love to see the AI defend their position against the player and race more aggressively against other AI drivers. 

Automobilista 2 is an awesome game for people looking for a variety of open wheel vehicles, including vintage open wheel, and a handful of stock, performance cars, and of course karts. 

This is the first great racing sim I've played with no particular glaring issue, which every other game on the market seems to have. That being said, I hope Reiza continues to improve on their work, specifically the AI, and adds more cars - of course, after a well deserved vacation.

I can honestly say that the driving feel has changed immensely (on most cars) since I first got this in EA. It seems like every other week there is a significant improvement in some area, usually physics/FFB or AI. They release weekly updates (at least) with a smattering of small patches and fixes released whenever they are ready. This is how Early Access should work.

I usually boot it up and do some laps after each major build changes something, so I can't say that I've tested every car or track...

Nothing is perfect yet, but the cars that work well are BRILLIANT to drive. AI still needs work (but what sim's AI doesn't?), brake pedal could be better, and VR performance isn't quite as good for me as it was in PCars 2 (although this can heavily vary from PC to PC and others don't seem to have this problem).

Even though i was well aware it was very Early Access, I wasn't impressed with what was made available on Day 1.

They have really worked on the car physics / handling to make them more driveable. Some of the cars are simply amazing now. My Personal fav is the F1 V10.

The driving physics strike a very very nice balance between realistic, and fun.
Especially the tires, and how you can play with the broad line between grip and no grip, just as it should be.
You're not thrown off a cliff for losing grip, instead you can regain traction and 'catch' cars around turns.

All of the content, the tracks, the cars, it's all polished and well done.
I haven't raced on a track that felt bad, and I haven't touched a car that felt bad either. They all feel great.
The cars seem to be all done with love, and not thrown in for extra content, and much of the tracks have several layouts, including multiple Historic and Karting layouts as well.

The only issues I can think of, is the AI is still a bit off (but you can easily see how good it will become), and [b]compared[/b] to other sims, there's not [i]as[/i] much content (Still highly polished though.)

The AI is a lot better but it's still not perfect - some track and car combs work well but on others, there is some really strange AI behaviour. I've been mainly racing online and it's been great fun. 

There's a good community of the Reiza forums so if you pick this us, I'd suggest heading there for advise on getting things set up perfectly.

At the moment, I'd recommend this for anyone who wants a really fun driving experience and people who want to race online. If you want to do single player races against AI, I'd wait until it's improved a bit more.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Original Review (after 5 hours)** It's improving every week - I haven't played a huge amount because I prefer offline races and the AI are still a bit dodgy on lots of tracks but I've seen enough improvement week on week to be pretty sure this game will be incredible once it leaves Early Access. 

If you want a polished, complete sim, wait until it's finished. If you want to go along for the ride and enjoy seeing this game progress each week, get it now.

TL;DR; If you like sim racing then you should by this. 

If the lack of GT3 cars or a Ferrari is a deal breaker for you then maybe this isn't the game for you. AMS2 is for drivers not for car enthusiasts.

This is the best sim for giving you the right feedback and physics for driving a car on the limit. It's the best because those aspects of the sim are up with the greats (LFS, RF2, AMS1) and in addition the graphics, immersion and experience are far better than those. You can argue the finer details of the feedback and physics, but frankly I don't care because I'm having too much fun balancing Caterhams through Druids :) 

Ok, now just to answer that question that is for some reason still being asked. No! This is not Project Cars 2 with a different logo! Project Cars out-of-the-box force feedback is like putting a rumble controller in jelly and holding it with mittens. It's nothing, it's crap. Yes with some tweaking you can get it usable. But that is all, just usable. The force feedback in AMS2 puts you in detailed control of the car at it's limits. You should not be comparing AMS2 with the sim-cade that is Project Cars 2. If you are you do not drive on the limits.

The game is still in early access which means there are a few incomplete features that everyone is crossing their fingers that Reiza get right.

Multiplayer, currently very basic. If they build a Sim Racing System clone this would be amazing.
AI, huge improvements recently. AI racing is fun but a little predictable.
Content, there are still some cars and tracks which still need work. 80% are complete.

Reiza have a great track record at continual development of their products so I would get in on this early and enjoy it all the way. What are you waiting for? GT3 cars? :P",1586022719,1589824863,True,3,1,0.534388899803161621,1,True,False,True

The game runs perfectly on my 5700 XT at 1440p and looks great doing it too. I was worried that given the use of the same engine as in PCARS2 it would drive more like that game than Automobilista 1. For the most part, that fear has been taken care of after my time driving AMS2. 

The tracks look amazing and the cars, for the most part, drive well. There are some cars that are obviously further along in development than others, and as a result there is some inconsistency in the way they feel. For instance, the Stock Cars feel fantastic, if a little loose on the stock setup. However the front wheel drive classic cars feel like an absolute mess and are not any fun at the moment. The Formula cars are hit or miss, but for the most part are quite convincing and fun. It's comforting to see the dev team put so much effort into each update though, and I am confident that most of the problems will be solved by the release of V. 1.0. Overall, if you're looking for some niche content done incredibly well on a promising platform, then get AMS2 now.

It's hard to put your finger on what it is exactly, and maybe the physics model is flattering to my crappy skill level, but either way this game makes me interested in circuit racing again.

It's still in early access so things could change, and right now there are some rough edges (no championship mode, some cars modelled better than others, occasional crashes) but it's already so much fun that wherever it goes from here I don't regret the purchase.

Lots of fun driving on South American tracks that I have never learned before, too. Enough international favourites are there to give you a reference point though (Virginia International Raceway, Montreal, Monaco, Oulton Park, Donington, Brands Hatch, Suzuka, Austria's A1-ring, etc.)

Also, when I heard it was based on the Project Cars 2 engine I was sceptical. I never played PC2 but I was a backer on PC1 and then very disappointed with how the game turned out. Physics never felt good at all to me. But this game is a revelation. Buy it, do laps at Oulton Park in a P3 car until 1 hour and 50 minutes have passed, and then refund it if you don't love it.

Tell you why, and being deadly serious here. Driving quickly on the edge is absolutely part of my DNA.. My late Ad had it, My brother has it, bit too much for my liking, though I think the issue may well be down to the time it takes my chin from pulling back to applying throttle.

So first things first... No, this is Not a PC2 asset flip. don't even listen to those guys. as a person that have AMS2 and PC2 (on PS4), i can say with all leters that the Physics model of AMS2 is completely, COMPLETELY different form PC2. i didn't have any dificulty piloting even the formula cars on PC2... here? i had to relearn what i knew about them, because boy oh boy they bit me in the ass...

So... let's dive into it:
Graphics: i think this is a Non issue... most if not all racing games looks beautifull to the eyes already, but this one really got the expectatives on the roof. they are Beautiful, and best of all, less demanding than AMS1... how did they manage to do this magic is beyond me, because using my RTX2070 it run on max on AMS1, but i could fry an egg on top of it, on AMS2 tho... it runs as cool as a freezer. the videocard doesn't even sweat.

Content:
yes yes, i know, it is lacking compared to PC2... but it is a beta. there is weekly updates and there will be a massive Season pass for the game. but Reiza games are Notoriously moddable, so i don't think that it will be long untill someone finds a way to put custom tracks and assets into the game. but, honestly, i still want Caruaru added before the Season pass arrives, please Reiza... DEW IT.

Story Mode:
it is here that the game has its sins, because unlike PC2, it hasn't any story or carreer mode... Yet... tbh, i miss that aspect of PC2, of being able of create a pilot and ascend into the various racing cathegories... it felt like i was a motosport driver tbh... when i performed good, the team congratulated me, when i performed bad, the team scolded me... and this aspect, altough not essential, is a very nice part of PC2, that Reiza IS capable of implementing in the future. they just need to want to do it.

Sound Design and Physics Engine:
Vastly Superior... when the tyres started to degrade on my race with the F-Extreme 2019, i really felt it, my times started to fall, and i knew it was the hour to pit.  Reiza is Notorious for making a Physics Engine that is simply one of the best, if not the best of the market. and i talk from personal experience. i just miss my engineer from PC2... come on... i want the guy incentivating me, telling me to not give up, to chase that position, to go for it... it IS part of the life of a pilot. and PC2 on this aspect delivered... Reiza gotta implement this on their game too... please... 

The Bugs of the Beta:
as always there is bugs here and there and things missing... DRS for example is not yet implemented on Interlagos (where i raced 1 of my 4 hours of experience up to this point), and the flag system needs a LOT more improvements to be on par if not better than PC2... i mean... seriously, i was taken out of a race because a backrunner did not recieve a blue flag to make way for me... sending me to the sand box... it is frustrating when happens... but hey, it is still a beta... also... the F-extreme cars were vibrating more than jello... and it feels weird viewing it from outside... WTF

Music:
Lacking... there is only one track on the menu as of yet. we need more music there, preferibly something catchy like the Spa theme PC2 has... i dunno if they'll manage to top PC2 in regards to this topic, because the music of that game is Sublime... but they can get close, if they contract a good musicist to it.

Final Veredict: 8/10
it is fun at this stage... and i not gonna lie that this got me much more hooked than PC2. but it Needs improvements, badly... especially in those small nuances PC2 had... i know Reiza is perfectly capable of delivering, because they delivered in AMS1 and is delivering on the key points here... it could score a 9 if its season pass wasn't so salty on my pocket... seriously... 300 Reais Reiza? i know that our country is in crisis and that the licensing is expensive as all hell, but guys... come on... and you shouldn't supress content that was already in PC2 like hockenheim and silverstone, unless there is licensing issues here (please comment bellow if this is the case). and BRING BACK CARUARU!",1588717915,1588718534,True,1,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,True

It features plenty of Brazilian cars/tracks which is no surprise considering Reiza are a Brazilian dev team, some of which I've never seen in a sim before which is a nice. Me personally I'd like to see a few more licensed cars and tracks that aren't in South America but those will eventually come in updates and in future DLC.

Speaking of PCARS2, because they both run on the MADNESS engine there's still a few too many similarities between the two titles than i'd like including some bugs, glitches and the handling characteristics of the cars that plenty of people including myself didn't like back then and still don't today but I can only hope that most of that can be sorted in upcoming updates.

At the time of writing this, there are issues with multiplayer primarily with netcode that the devs acknowledge and are working to fix. They are planning to release a ranked multiplayer system which has become a must for all sims.

All in all, if you are a fan of PCARS2 then I'd definitely recommend this. If you've never played AMS1, the PCARS games or even a racing game/sim before, don't be afraid to try it while it's still discounted.

I practice with rFactor2, and race with AC.
This sim is thankfully not akin to Project Cars.  It feels like Automobilista.
To keep it simple, somewhere in between the big 3, and rightfully.
FFB is very good, while I would consider AMS1's to be fantastic.  Very close, and detailed, but not quite as, ehhhh....rugged.  Something.  It does NOT, however fulfill any worries about the madness engine.  With a T500, it feels like a hardcore sim.

Graphics are great, and seems to run well.  On triples, and still tweaking with a 980.
Sound is good, however in 2020, just average.  Enjoyable, nothing groundbreaking.
Menus are PC2 menus in a nutshell.
Weather is wonderful, live track dynamics are great.

Any worries about the game engine itself went away with the first drive.  It's an early review, with just about 2 hrs in game.  It's familiarity instantly filled me with a comfort for how this game will turn out.

My big worry, however is this game's true life and user base.  With this content, and don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining at all, I fear that the user base will remain small.  This needs to pull out some bigger name content.  The game's core is heading in a great direction.  It's solid, strong physics are noticeable quickly.   But then....you kinda want to feel this game (and engine)'s advanced physics......with a Ferraria F40.  Or maybe the GTTC 1960's era cars.  And that's the draw that can keep this game from breathing fresh air.  Without modding support, the remedy is crushed.  And so we are left with a really good, hardcore simulator, with great content, that is unfamiliar.  Personally for me that's okay, the good physics and pretty good multiplayer racing or decent AI racing still is worth it.  But I'm not sure it'll be worth it for everyone.  I'll still recommend it.

I have spent 10 hours fine tuning my force feedback profile on AC and with the newest update to the force feedback I am now getting better feedback out of the stock profile on Automoblista 2 then I have in any other sim to date. I am able to feel every small bump on brands hatch in VR it feels like I am there.

You are able to push the cars all the way to the edge of traction without the sudden snap oversteer you would get in project cars 2.

Now onto the AI in this game, it will give you a real workout while the computer still seems human. Load up a full grid of Karts and they will dive bomb you going into corners just to fly off the track, the ai will hit cones and spin out. You heard me no silly single file progression it realy feels like every ai driver had there own set of skills. It actually feels like you are racing a full grid of humans.

Now onto the VR performance, I am able to run the game on a mix of low and medium settings while pulling a solid 90 fps at a frametime of 9-11ms with super sampling disabled.

I love all the newest racing sims cos they're shiny and nice. I have no criticism with any FFB in my games cos I'm not really that discerning; I just kind of tweak the settings a little, put in a bit of trial and error and then just kind of adapt and go for it. I usually just hop between the games doing endless hot-laps.

If you're this sort of gamer then, of course, AMS 2 should be in your library along with AC, ACC, DR1+2, F1 2017/8/9, PC2 and RRRE. (The hardcore / more serious can head on over to RF2 and iRacing.) The game ran flawlessly straight out of the box while recognising my Logitech G29. I didn't have to change a single setting for anything - very important for getting those casual gamers on board. There is a very slight but noticeable downgrade in graphics from PC2, meaning the game runs buttery smooth on high settings on my system - marvellous! As far as FFB, well, for someone who doesn't notice it, I really DID notice it here - and for all the good reasons. It feels just great! Once they get the time-trials up and running that will be the icing on this delicious cake! 

I had minor issues with the absence of mini-maps for some tracks; most track length measurements being incorrect; no personal best times being displayed anywhere and the green split time being too small and hard to read on a dark blue background... but these are all known issues and are being taken care of.  

My main and only real gripe is the fact that on the V8 (maybe on some others too I'm not sure) a whopping great windscreen wiper was protruding in a perpendicular manner right slap bang in the middle of the windscreen - looking very ugly into the bargain and obscuring my view in a very obnoxious way. Unfortunately, the developers haven't implemented wiper movement yet and no key binding applications will budge it! So why they simply couldn't just have the offending item resting at the bottom of the windscreen - to allow a clear view - is a mystery that may never be solved in this lifetime.

Anyway, it's a great game! Go buy it while it's 40% off and if you have reservations cos it's early access - just be patient and install the thing on the 1.0 release and hey presto - you have the full and complete game already purchased at the bargain price!!

Im not a seasoned Vet So I cant tell you or run down to you everything I fell like this games does right or wrong.
What I can say id that I fell like in this early stage its lacking in vehicles for sure, And im pretty sure its lacking in circuits as well. The game is not a gpu heater like ACC So that is a feature I like about it. Its not a heavy load on my rig. The graphics are pretty good looking I cannot complain there. I fell like it all comes together on the track when you are racing.
I do not regret purchasing this game and look forward to more content coming to this game for sure. More vehicles more circuits game modes etc. it seem to work well with both my CSL ELITE WHEELBASE+ and LC Pedals As well as my CSWV2.5 and V3 Pedals. You may have to tinker around for a sec to get things to work but thats with most games.
My overall opinion is that if your on the fence about getting this game I would say go ahead and get it. Dont expect it to be so great of a game right off the bat no. Expect it to get better over time because I really do feel that this is whats going to happen. Reiza wants to make sure they dont put things in here that they cant take out.

People who write reviews on this vary between those that say it feels just like Project Cars, and those that say it's nothing like Project Cars.  From my perspective the cars do drive exactly like Project Cars.  Let's break that down; cars oversteer easily, but catching the car in an oversteer situation is far too easy.  They tend to oversteer like a 500kg weight is attached to the back of the car and the feeling is very linear, irrespective of which car you choose.  I drove a formula 3 car around Interlagos, starting on slick tyres.  Half way through the race it started to rain and because I'd accelerated weather up, the track was totally wet.  Yet despite this I was able to push the car into corners at unrealistic speeds, boot the throttle and control the oversteer easily.  I'm no Senna and there's no way I should have even finished a lap, let alone finish 1st.  I don't know if the game simulates getting tyres dirty, but there is no visible indicator that this has happened.

As many mention, locking the brakes is far too easy.  This could be improved with caliberating the controls, but in my mind the game detected my G29 - why should I have to mess around with this?

AI is poor on the first lap - you can pass 3/4 of the field in the first two corners.  This shouldn't be Mario Kart.  It does improve after that but opponents still twitch around when you drive next to them, just like Project Cars 1 does.

Sound is pretty poor with repetitive droning sounds that are really distracting.

Graphically the game is okay (settings on high/ultra).  Much of the track scenery is very basic, so grass and trees aren't detailed.  The game looks the part during sunrise, sunset and when raining, but that's all thanks to the engine.  Attention to detail on the cars themselves is a mixed bag.  Quite often the driver's legs will be cutting through the seat, the hand won't shift gears remotely in the correct place.  Suspension components don't move with the wheel.  I know this is early access, but many of the modded cars in AC have better attention to detail.

This review has been quite harsh I think.  There are moments when the game can be fun, but not as an accurate (or approaching accurate) simulation.  It's obviously early access so it can undergo improvements.  But as it stands, the game isn't getting the basics right.  I've seen games try and improve but if the foundations aren't right in the first place there is only so much that can be done.  I haven't mentioned content, but for what it's worth the car selection isn't anything to write home about.  Tracks are okay but I'm unfamiliar with many of them.  I think asking > £90 for DLC when the game is in its current state is particularly audacious.

TLDR; Project Cars 1 did what this does and did it five odd years ago.  Other games currently do a lot better job.  It's early access, things could change.  I can't recommend it as it is right now.",1587252608,1587252608,False,29,13,0.492603152990341187,4,True,False,True

I tested the ARC Camaro and compared both lap after lap.
The FFB is a bit more mushy in AMS2 with both same FFB settings (100% gain, 40% low force boost, Thrustmaster T500).
But more important you cannot get the ARC Camaro to slide under braking! If you turn your wheel before braking, its super grippy under braking and just brakes in a straight line. Not so in AMS1 where you can do a small controlled slide with steering before braking (dont know the correct english term, sorry) I mean who tested this? Is that meant to be this way? 
I watched some real ARC onboards and the AMS1 versions seems to be more true to that impression. Its more lively and you can easily slide it. Drifting in AMS2 with ARC Camaro is not possible with that Version and fixed setup. I did not change the setup in the AMS1 version either.

If you love AMS1 you should wait, if you like PC2, you will love this.
I am a bit dissapointed. I think AMS1 has the best feeling.

Performance is very nice, a few bugs here and there (massive drag if you slide on a wall, KI absolutely useless even in 0.8.3.2 patch, sad because AMS1 KI is one of the best, steering sensitivity not changeable)

I will wait for sure but this is not what I hoped it will be from the FFB and Physics.  FFB feels slower than AMS1s FFB (maybe not 360hz?) and physics a mix between PC2 and Rfactor2. I heared somewhere that they use the rfactor2 tire modell. not the best in my opinion. mushy.",1587244306,1587244306,True,1,2,0.501915693283081055,0,True,False,True

This is just fun. The force feed back and handling inform well and cut you enough slack to experiment without you killing yourself. This is what my years of real racing were like. When on a tight budget you would turn up in the morning, practice and qualify all in a 15-20 minute session and then race in the afternoon. By the time the race was over you were really getting the hang of it and wanted another go but it was over at that track for another year. You rarely crashed without taking a silly gamble. Automobilista 2 kind of felt like that to me. Gritty enough that you could have fun by pushing too hard without being over punished, then learn and improve on the next lap. 

Now to declare my bias, I am otherwise I'm a frustrated rFactor2.. VR fan (brilliant when it all comes together....try Historic F3 at Aintree as the rubber builds up)...have a go, die, have a go, die, play with graphics settings, live a bit longer.... die....the game just punishes you away for another try after the next month's update (Note to any developers: we are already being punished by having our brains cooked in the headset and headphones so give us a break and at least make the menus usable out of the headset as Automobilista 2 / PC2 does). 

Assetto Corsa Competitione is pretty good but the VR isn't there yet and it is just tin tops and I'm one of the very odd ones out that cannot get into Assetto Corsa even with so many mods and tools because the FFB/Handling/VR don't do it for me (just a personal thing I guess). 

So I went back and tried Project Cars 2 which has some fantastic looking cars....Ferarri 412 Coda Lunga (thought the world had forgotten this beauty), but the FFB/Handling is now more exposed by what Reiza has done and I quit pretty quickly. 

So early access review 85% and there is more to come (e.g. better graphics on the cars). rF2 just slipped into P2 (and it belongs in P1)

P1: Automobilista 2
P2: rF2
P3: ACC

Lot of cars have great handling and sound.
High quality and detailed tracks. Some of them are very rare in simracing games.
Graphics wise the sim looks stunning. (Thanks Madness Engine & PC2! 😋)

Kerb handling is 10/10.
Ok controller support.
VR.

Take it from someone who wasted a lot of hours trying to look and love beyond the glorious graphics, weather system and VR play of Project Cars 2. AMS2 is definitely not PC2 or PC3 as some people describe it. For a start (and here is my only negative) at this early stage of AMS2, if you are playing on a monitor setup, then to my eye the game looks better in PC2. If I had to try and explain it, the colours and contrast just don't seem right to my eyes? Don't get me wrong, the game looks great in AMS2 but its just that PC2 set the bar so high. But the weather system and VR experience in AMS2 show no signs of compromise and are excellent. Best of all is the driving experience. Even still using my Logitech G27, the FFB and reaction of the many cars  and track combinations I have tried is brilliant. Yeah it took some tweaking of the FFB settings on my part to get it how I like it but guidance from Reiza themselves plus the game forum and discussion sites were and are always on hand to help.  Unlike PC2 and Ian Bell & co, the Reiza team are hard at work implementing the improvements they had planned and responding to our feedback. Already they have started as promised updating the game. The last update as I write, v0.8.2.0 incorporated a number of tweaks and fixes including further improvements to the FFB and AI. I will confess I hate or rather find GT3 cars boring as hell. I prefer all other car types. BUt if you are fed up with F1 type cars that simply go round in circles on the spot whatever you do in PC2 then head over to AMS2 to see how they should behave when driven correctly.

Handling on all cars is comical and stinks of Project Cars 2. Some cars refuse to move when wheel is on full lock, then just drive straight on when you give them enough power. The handling is just too arcade and easy. Its just not exciting and not even close to being realistic. Madness engine at its finest. For me physics are where Reiza need to pend their time. 

Performance in the rain is worse than any other game i own. Horrific. 
Dry tyres are faster than wet tyres when its raining. 
FFB. Nothing good worth mentioning. 

Graphics are ok, nothing special.

Brake-feel needs to be tuned further. As of this moment it appears more difficult to find the braking threshold, even on HE Ultimate pedals, as compared to other sims such as rFactor 2, AC and ACC.

Works great with Simucube 1 direct drive wheel also, though the force feedback tuning is a bit different from other sims.

Using triples, works reasonably well at the moment. I found though that I had to edit the config-file in the Documents-folder to tune it to my liking.

I am confident that these small issues will be adressed though.

With a bit of tweaking of the FFB out of the box 80% of the cars actually feel very good to drive. I had a feeling Reiza would get to work pretty quickly but WOW! definitely worth a buy!

AI, still needs work. Slow in corners and rapid in straight lines and the F1 cars could feel a bit better but this will all come I'm sure of it. Would love to be able to run this over 1080 resolution ultra wide but we'll see if that's possible (My rig is over recommended in all areas)


Currently it's a no from me. Better FFB than Project cars 2 but has a lot of the same elements that make PC2 & 1 Unenjoyable to drive like the locking wheels with a third break pedal pressure and screeching tire sounds, it also feels like you need to saw the wheel somewhat. On the upside you can feel when you start to lose grip at the front. Present state 50% the cars feel slightly better than average and the other 50% I wouldn't go back to. Reiza are great though and I'm hoping this gets a lot of work. Haven't tried VR yet. Graphics are pretty nice and can run it mostly maxed out ultra wide 1080 with a 1080ti. Could be optimised a little better but I'm sure they will fix that. I just feel largely underwhelmed at this stage with how it is. When the modding community get their hands on this later on with official skins etc I think it'll be a pretty decent game.

This game is been compared to PC2 since everyone is referencing that -The game works better (higher settings) graphics wise but its not very clear. SS does not seem to do anything. The only way to get it clear is use the sharpening tool in the folders (same place as PC2) i find .6-1.3 the best but does cause some extra shimmer higher you go. On some tracks things kinda look like they are on top of each other (clouds and lines on road) Tress move as you pass them weirdly . Graphics are better as far as say trees and clouds (despite looking like they we slapped over the pc2 clouds) but not much better.  It feels like im looking at a clone of pc2 someone tried to make better. Also noticed it has that same , not as immersive feel, as PC2. Several racing sims you feel like you are in that environment and objects feel big. This and PC2 not so much. Even with max graphics it still looks just ok. When turning at times it has that same annoying micro stutter assetto corsa has (yes turned down graphics to rule that out) Everyone is asking is it like pc2 wit regards to handling , in a way i think its better physics wise right out the box. It doesnt take long to enjoy driving. Would i recommend this in the future? Maybe as it feels like they need more finishing touches. Would i recommend it now ? still maybe. I went between PC1,PC2,AC,lfs, RE3 and Rfactor2 and this and PC2 are worst in terms of graphics for vr. Shadows dance hard so turn them off or deal.

Its still in early access so it's by no means complete. In my opinion it's not up to scratch to AMS1, however it much better i think than PC2. The cars do feel more connected to the track.
Sounds are very good and even as it stands would rival any race sim on the market today. I havent purchased the DLC season packs as they are i feel a little on the expensive side.
The forum is a great place to give feedback and highlighting and bugs so this is not the place for fault logging, all in all simply put, if you like AMS and Sim Racing, then this is worth £25 of anyone's money.

That's why I love iracing, great visuals in VR and triples and my gtx1070 can handle it easily. This sim in VR is beautiful with fanastic performance, possibly overtaking iracing as the best simracing VR experience.
A fear I had from some reviews on here and comments on forums and youtube was that the physics and handling of the cars wasn't as great as AMS1 but I think the majority of cars are great and the FFB for me is great and was pretty much plug and play with my Fanatec CSWv2, I hardly had to fiddle with the setting's at all.
I do admit that the Formula Classic feels very planted under initial throttle application which is different from AMS1 and is probably not quite right, but I took the Dallara F3 out at Oulton Park and it felt exactly like it did in AMS1 and was very tricky to drive and I was getting corner exit oversteer coming out of the 2nd chicane just like i used to in the first game.
The F3,P3,P4 and the Caterhams all feel absolutely fantastic and are orders of magnitude better than PCars 2 content.
The car sounds are also superb and a huge improvement on Pcars.
The AI need some work, they seem to swerve across the track when driving in a straight line but they all do it at the same point on different tracks so it's probably just a bug.

So even though it's very early days for AMS2 I'm very confident that this is going to be a fantastic sim. 
There are certainly things that need working on but nothing too major and if we can't trust Reiza to get it right then who can we trust?
If you loved the driving experience and feel of AMS1 then I think you will love this sim, plus you have weather and VR now aswell. But if you are the sort of person who likes their driving games to have all the best licenses and a fleshed out career mode then this probably isn't for you, but then again neither was AMS1, but even so at this reduced Early Access price it is an absolute bargain no matter your preferences.",1585859271,1585934323,True,4,0,0.507343113422393799,0,True,False,True

It took me 2 hours just to get comfortable with the handling, setting up the wheel, setting up the FOV and barely STARTED with tuning and that's just in 1 car.

What that 2 hours did tell me was this will take a LOT of time and EFFORT to master and that's not including setting the basics I mentioned above....

This isn't REALLY for casual gaming... Unless you have LOADS of experience in Sim racers (I don't) patience will be the watchword, you CAN'T expect to jump in and excel, that MIGHT leave a lot of people frustrated but even the short time I've been messing about in just 1 car has shown the effort and time required will be well worth it.

This is a challenging game but ultimately extremely rewarding if you're willing to put in the effort, Personally I most often play arcade games but having played PCars 1, 2 & Assetto Corsa, I had a better idea what to expect and entered KNOWING I would be all over the place to start with...

This is EARLY ACCESS so DON'T expect everything to be perfect, many parts are missing, several cars don't even have stats yet, it's still in beta and will be for quite a while yet so a LOT of polish is required before it can even be considered to be anything more than that.

There are allot of different pros and cons to this game as it is released in early access. I'm no pro simracer and I've only been playing ACC, AC, PC2 and the F1 Codemaster games to compare. So this is just my opinion and I could be wrong. Also I acknowledge this is early access.

Cons:
- Some cars could use more grip, sometimes it feels like you cant lean on the tyres.
- Sense of speed is just off with the cars, I'm doing 120kmph in AMS 2, where in other sims or arcade games it feels like I would be doing 80kmph or even less. It also feels like the higher the speed you reach, the bigger the difference in speed from the actual sense of speed you'd find in other racing games. So 60kmph in game feels like 40kmph, but then as you ramp it up 200kmph feels like 130kmph.
- There is a great variety of different racing car types, but that said very limited amount of cars you can actually drive at the end of the day. 
- Some of the cars also have very low down force and some overly high and it is very difficult to judge compared to other racing games. (Formula cars)
- The tracks don't feel fleshed out, but that is to be expected of and early access game.
- The cockpit camera and the player body that is in the car comes in contact with your camera and would be nice if they could just disable the player from being seen in cockpit cam.
- Could use more camera settings, like the ability to control the pitch of the camera and also the ability tho adjust other camera modes height and or horizontal distance.
-Some cockpit car sounds feel very monotone inside the car, where outside they sound amazing, also the sounds seem a bit delayed for track sound effects.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Pros:
- The game feels new and fresh and the car variety is awesome
- New interesting tracks that I've never driven before and its cool of them going for a different taste of track variety.
- Most of the cars feel highly detailed inside for those that are finished.
- The car sounds are great for most cars.
- Force feedback is good.
- Graphics looks good.
- Some cars feel really nice to drive even with some tweaking needed.

I really hope they can turn this game around. Listen to the community and make a game everyone can be proud of. We really need someone to set an example of how racing games can be made. I'm looking at you PC2....

Pros- 
Great graphics
Vr is implemented well
Simhub works with it
Good ffb
Nice physics
Easy to setup multiplayer lobbies

Physics:
The physics model feels like a step forward from Project CARS 2 (this game uses the Madness Engine). Overall most of the cars are amazing, but there are a few as of writing this (April 2nd 2020) that are still bad. The F1 cars from all the different eras are my personal favorites. You'll find amazing representations of F1 cars from the 60's through till the modern 2019 cars and they all are amazing to drive (especially in VR). The Copa Classics are another highlight as these low power, low grip beauties allow for some good ""grass roots"" racing action. 

Tracks:
You'll find classics such as Monaco (Azure Circuit lifted straight from Project CARS 2), Spielberg, Interlagos, Montreal, Suzuka (it's renamed for licensing reasons), Oulton Park, Donington Park, Snetterton, etc. There are a few rarities like Jerez and Adelaide, but most of the tracklist skews to Brazilian tracks (Reiza Studios home country). There are plenty of good tracks, but it feels incomplete. Hopefully we'll see more content in this regard soon. For the price during early access, there still some great tracks. 

Multiplayer:
This currently feels like a massive step backwards. One of Project CARS 2's strengths was it's online community. It may have not been as competitive as iRacing, but you could easily find a lobby in a few minutes. The format is relatively similar, but there are bugs and bad UI & HUD decisions plaguing the game at the moment. There is no rating system, no way to track stats, no way to save replays, no way to tell how many laps a race is during any other session than the race, no way to spectate other cars (in VR at least), no way to adjust trackside cameras, etc. This aspect of the game needs the most work. 

VR:
Using the Madness Engine was an excellent choice for VR. Project CARS 2 was already great for VR users, and this is no different. Performance relative to settings is a little better, though I find this game doesn't look quite as good as Pcars 2 did on higher settings.

I don't see that as a bad thing as they have greatly improved the the main aspect I disliked about PC2, that being the handling. The improvement to the tyres and force feedback are night and day and the amount of cars and tracks included makes this an absolute bargain.

They have kept all the best parts of the Madness engine that PC2 uses like the VR, dynamic weather and time of day. The VR works very well and even on my old i5 4690k / GTX 970 system I'm able to get a stable 90fps in test day mode.

There are things missing and the UI needs some improvement, but there is a reason why this is in Early Access and even things not being perfect, you still can have a great time.

It is hard for me to tell if the FFB is better than ACC, but I can definitively feel the car losing grip, reacting to the terrain and overall I am pretty happy.

I saw a lot of people complaining about an issue with the breaks, which I didn't experience, but the first thing I did was to calibrate it before starting, so maybe that is something that everyone should do...

Project Cars 2 has a pretty bad AA, in my opinion, AMS2 is looking better and with super-sampling it is barely noticiable. I am having a hard time to decide if it looks better than ACC, they do well in different aspects.

Good:- 

- Its not PC2, it just has its good Graphics which are good!
- VR is good
- Lower Tier Cars are really fun to drive
- Good variety that not many other racing games give
- Loads oif tracks (and their different lay outs)
- Cars handling is believable and good. 
- some Tracks i have not seen or seen a lot of on any sim. 

Meh:- 

- Multiplayer seems a bit off
- I hate it when games only provide half a class (in this instance LMP1, 2, 3, 4 and the formulas)
- Cant do time trials. 
- The AI

Bad:-

- FFB, needs work. its playable just not good. 
- Braking, I get that if i stamp the brakes the tires can lock up but this shouldnt be the case in faster cars at higher speeds (Mainly LMP1, 2 and the fast formulas). Though i do understand it in cars like the stock cars. 
- Using your steering wheel to navigate the menu in VR is clunky. 

In Conclusion:- 

Its not PC2, dont worry! the Lower tier/track day style racing is something other sims dont offer a lot at where i feel AM2 will be king of. There are some issues that i feel need fixing but i think with the financial support of the purchase we may get a similar experience to ACC where there game started off garbage and become (to me) one of our favourite racing sims.

So this sim feels amazing and to be honest I don't think I will ever go back to rf2 or iRacing(iRenting) after experiencing this masterpiece. I will do some drifting in AC just because of the many mods and servers I enjoy but that's all. Now some bad stuff but first let me say that FFB is the best of all sims available so is graphics (same as PC2 but colours are tuned so it looks more real) maps that were available in PC2 are not imported to this title, they are made by Reiza, even the small assets like buildings, tirewalls etc. So going to the bad stuff... oh and tire flex model and handling is just amazing!! (and so is VR experience and performance) ok, ok.
I was not a huge fun of AMS 1 so you can be sure I am not a Reiza psycho fan, however I do remember FFB and loads of different content was there indeed (BRING THE SUPER TRUCKS!) 
(SO) 
- Some bits of UI is missing, for example: how much time is left for a session before we go on a server, chat is not available in the lobby or pits, you have to ""be in the car"" to start talking to other people on the server.
- No damage model yet - just mechanical and in my opinion it should be much more hardcore, as this is a hardcore sim from hardcore simracers FOR hardcore simracers for gods sake. Oh and windshield in race cars does not shatter like this irl but that's to do with all other sim titles.
- rev limiter sound is not there yet so without looking at the gauges it's hard to tell in certain cars.
- Collisions with other cars are not perfect ( I crashed 3 players in 1 race (Sprint cars)  by following them too close but visually I still had some gap between).
- Spotter is not yet available so it feels a bit empty while racing because of that ( yes I did enable it in the settings ) but then in Beta 5 or 6 I did hear spotters in the game when watching other people on YT so it might be just me.
- official MOD support would be great as this sim has potential for another 10 years and as a modder I am happy to invest my time in creating maps and cars for this title however I know it will make the servers look more empty (or players spread out on many servers you need content to join and that's what made rf2 dead for me even if it was a great sim).

Overall - this is a must have for a sim racing fan, however there is still some stuff to take care of by Reiza, and by looking at their speed in releasing new patches and updates I believe they will fix everything in no time.",1585814200,1585814219,True,1,0,0,2,True,False,True

The game isn't perfect, and is still in early access - so bear that in mind that you are buying an unfinished game right now - but at a generous discount. The AI can produce some fun racing, but lack a lot of situational awareness and I'd advise turning the brake sensitivity down in your setting as it is easy to lock them. As for a good starting point - P3 and Stock Car series are real highlights, in addition to the Formula V10, Copa Truck and the FIAT Unos.

It is not Project CARS 2.5, and that's clear to see from the first time you slide a car - it is easily catchable, as opposed to the SMS model of just spinning you. The handling is so much more intuitive than Project CARS 2, which is not to be unexpected due to the quality of Reiza's previous work. That being said, it does come with some of Project CARS 2's best features - such as a brilliant weather system in addition to an easily setup 4 class Multi-class racing system.

The content will not appeal on paper to everyone, but that is part of the fun - you can race GT3's at Spa in any number of sims, but only here can you race a FIAT Uno around an Ecuadorian Track. The less recognisable content is Reiza's biggest strength, even if the headline grabbing Formula One style cars are also excellent. 

This isn't the sim a lot of people want it to be, and that's okay if it isn't what you want it to be - however at the current price with more updates on the way, its difficult not to recommend it. In addition, if you are not a fan of the Madness engine, Automobilista 1 is still an excellent sim on an older engine.

This game is a work in progress, we're lucky to even have It realised now as it is underdeveloped for early access. (I say that because people assume early access means = fully completed). 

Unfortunately, this is why developers choose to delay releases, because of morons harping on about how great iRacing or some other sim is when compared to an early beta game like AMS2 which literally several car's physics are being reworked as we speak.

For crying out loud, some reviewers complain there's no ""Porsche or Ferrari!"". This is a small time development team. Where do you expect they have the money for those types of licensing? Clearly these people have never heard of mods or DLCs. And if people would do some research, you'd see Reiza has been affected by COVID-19 lockdowns and still have the passion to work on AMS2 and release it as is. Reiza studios as a whole is a very passionate company, you can see that evidence reflected in the DLC collaboration they did with RF2 and all the AMS1 DLC.

Anyways, as for the game, I'm happy to say that the iconic AMS1 handling/FFB has made its way to AMS2. If you're not familiar, AMS1 has some of the best handling of any sim out there. 

AMS2 promises just that and now with stunning visuals from the Project Cars 2 engine. Overall it's decent. It hasn't blown me away, but I've thoroughly enjoyed several cars like the AJR. It's important to note, several car physics are in the works now too. 

My only complaint about the game is that the sound is kind of underwhelming and not that immersive. It lacks content too, I would like to see more international content in the future that is free to entice users to buy it. But I understand that's not entirely possible with the situation around the world and the dev team size.

If there's one thing I hope for just like AMS1 is full on modding support. The only way I see AMS2 being a real competitor is having some workshop modding capabilities. The sooner people can get iconic race tracks modded over, the better. (FYI, Project Cars 2 has car mods, there's also several modding teams who've made cars for PC2 recently as testing grounds for AMS2).

And to those eager to be negative about this sim: no is forcing you to buy, It's funny most of them own rFactor 2 and it's DLC content which is severely overpriced compared to other sims.

If you want to buy it, look at SimRacing604 or SimRacingCorner on youtube, buy it, play it, make your choice and keep it or refund it. Simple.

If you liked project cars and wanted better handling, you'll like this. If you liked AMS1, you'll like this. If you're a general sim degenerate, you'll probably like this.

I've been ""sim racing"" for about a year now. I know some people want to compare this to PC2 because of the engine, but I can't comment on that. I've never touched PC2.

Played on a Thrustmaster T300 RS.

FFB - Not bad. Better than ACC slightly IMO. Curbs felt pretty good, but depends on the car.
Tire Model - Not bad. Better than iRacing. I prefer the ACC tire model.
Graphics - They are ok, but I feel like in 2020 we could be striving for more than this. ACC looks significantly better in every way and runs perfectly fine for me. This game is on par with iRacing in terms of graphics. Maybe a hair better because of the lighting.
Car variety - For me, it feels lacking. The variety of cars not only feels low, but the vast majority of them just aren't very interesting. There are some Formula cars, but most are vintage. 
Wheel Support - So I had no issues at all setting up my T300 RS. Everything worked out of the box. I did calibrate my setup prior to racing, but that was it.
Content - Not much. There is a ""Championship"" mode, which just didn't interest me. There's of course multiplayer, which is limited to a simple server browser. There's a single race mode where you can practice or customize whatever race parameters you want.
Tracklist - There's actually a good amount of tracks for an Early Access title. I'll be honest, most of them I've never heard of, but there are a few classics in the bunch. Not much to complain about here, other than I'd have liked to have seen more popular tracks added.
Multiplayer - Nothing special here. There's a server list and you can choose what you want to join. As of yesterday, there weren't many players online in the US, so I only saw about 15 servers up and most were limited on drivers. I ran 2 races and it was just messy as you would expect day 1 on any racing sim. Damage doesn't appear to come into play at all. I was hit and thrown into a wall multiple times in these races and didn't suffer any damage related issues. i imagine this is probably going to allow very filthy racing and something to watch moving forward.

Overall, I'd give the game 6/10 right now. It's definitely a sim, no question. Not everything feels great and I only enjoyed about 3-4 cars out of the bunch. Most of the cars weren't at all interesting to me. The online is ok. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who is already playing iRacing and/or ACC and enjoying it.

Sad but true, this is not what I am looking for in 2020.

Feels like Reiza is more like a authorized modder with official factory support, relying entirely on the underling engine framework -> PC2.

At least we know now, rFactor engine was the magic knife and Reiza was able to use it to produce a very special sim.

Correction -> I have to to statement in order to post this review. So I will not recommend it as I see it rather positioned as a more on the hardcore side racing simulator (and I can't check that tickbox).

Is it a hardcore Sim? No, it is not, it is more a racing game with a good fun factor. The cars are quite easy to handle (which is kind of weird when it comes to fast open wheelers). The heritage of PCars2 physics is still there. Along with this it still has some weird jolting, strangely heavy weight on the wheel in turns (not with every car though), far too easy catching of cars in oversteer situations, e.g. F3 feels like I drive a street sportscar with winter tyres on a summer day. At least they got mostly rid off the self realignment of cars out of spin situations in Pcars2 (that was absolutely ridiculous and a testimony that that one was an arcade racer in the end).

Feedback of track/surface: Nothing near what ACC or iRacing offers in that department.

Is the car roster any good? No, it is a joke for a non-Brazilian. The only cars you could actually be interested in, are the Caterham and the F3, with most other cars I can only shrug my shoulders. If you do not care about specific brands and real (race)-cars, no problem. Maybe with additional content that gets better.

FFB settings: If you hate to configure the hell out of the wheel settings to get proper feedback, this is not the title - it allows (like PCars2) individual configs. For me this is just a poor attempt to cover up for bad physics simulation. If the physics are good you do not have to do anything except setting the gain to have proper FFB - no dampening, no friction, no spring, no additional artificial effects! The problem with this is: development of physics is extremely complex, needs top specialists and the according budget. If you have a constant stream of revenues like iRacing you can do a lot of things but it shows when it comes to complex tyre physics or damage model. I wish that kind of development would be shared more along the different companies.

VR/Motion platform support: Works well ""out-of-the-box"", definitely a plus for AMS2! For triple screen setup I had to do some config alterations, but worked fine as well. (tested with Vive Pro, Dofreality P3)

Oh, and a last thing: Do not believe Youtubers, praising this as an hardcore racing simulation. It is not. But: It makes a lot of fun casually - and for a lot of players, that is good enough.

I was a big fan of both AMS1 and PC2 and this really brings together a lot of those. There's some headroom to go before full release but this game just oozes potential right now.

The AI are a tad odd but can still be enjoyable to race against. They sort of form a train but with time I'm sure they will become more lifelike. Headlights don't work and neither do wipers it seems. Other than these small issues I have been absolutely loving it since I bought it.

The cars feel great, especially once I got the force feedback to my liking. I use an Accuforce V2 and set the ffb gain to 65 and turned low force down to zero. I didn't mess with anything else other than getting rid of any pedal deadzones that were there by default. The cars slide beautifully which is generally how I know I'm going to like a Sim. The tracks are also a nice mix of unique circuits and ones you probably know. Curvello is my current favorite track and if I have to pick a favorite car so far it would be the p4 mcr. 

Graphically the game is quite pretty. It looks a lot like project cars 2 but I feel like something about it does look different despite using the same engine. I tested the sim both on a single screen and in my Oculus rift cv1. In VR it is really beautiful and I have most graphics settings on high and supersampling in game set to 1.5.

In it's current state I am enjoying it immensely. With that said I can't recommend it if you are looking for a complete title, wait until it is out of early access for that.",1585724477,1585724477,True,3,0,0.518348574638366699,0,True,False,True

1066890,66311309,76561198022300896,363,7,2857,0,42,1694083389,"AMS 2 is a bit of a mixed bag right now.

The quality of the experience depends heavily on which car you drive. Some feel like a great step in the right direction, and others feel completely unpredictable, even unfair in how they respond. The main stock cars, the modern F1, and the Formula V10 are all some of the better drives in the game.

That said, no car truly outshines the previous game, and the game certainly still feels in development. While AMS 2 is leagues ahead of Project CARS, sprinkles of that game remain. The worst offender, in my opinion, is under braking. The brakes lack nuance, and often feel too powerful, with any touch of 100% brake power likely to cause a lock-up no matter how brief. Cars also seem skittish in the middle of the corners still, and a slight adjustment is likely to cause a spin despite feeling well within the limits of the car.

But when AMS 2 is good, it's fantastic. Reiza have created a very strong foundation, and if they can keep improving, AMS 2 has the potential to be one of the best of all-time. Graphics are an obvious improvement, but I have also found the AI to be leaps ahead of the gMotor 2 AI in the previous game. They are very reactive to the player, but not as much to give up positions without a fight. They also make very human-like errors, which helps the race feel more alive than ever. 

So who is it for? AMS 2 is not a replacement of the first game yet. If you are looking for the next step, a full-featured masterpiece, certainly don't discredit this game - but it's not quite for you yet. If, however, you are an enthusiast, someone who's willing to put up with some lackluster experiences in order to follow the game closely - this sim will make some impressive first strides. 

Think of this game not in terms of how much you will spend for it, but rather, how much time you will invest. 

Not recommended for those who want a completed masterpiece, but easily suggested to any who want to see it grow.
