After having played i can give an honest review

cons
Esc doesn't get you out of menus
Some characters are so op and broken you will see nothing but those characters run around and destroy the entire map
Graphics are ugly as hell
EA monetization strategy
a personal preference but they literally didn't add one Character I like from the manga other than Toga who they locked

Pros

- It is way too hard to unlock all the characters. This doesn´t make any sense in this type of game. 
- You can complete missions and get no reward because the developers didnt think of that and  if you complete your missions, you wont get any rewards if you already collected your daily ones. But you still keep getting new missions, completely brainless concept. 
- People can leave your game anytime and wont get punished at all. And then there you are stuck in a game where you are playing alone or as two against full squads and have no chance of winning whereas the guy that has left your game is queuing further without any punishment or so. 
- The interface is probably made for console only because it is not smooth at all. There is no way to use chat in game because it takes you aaaaggeees to write the simplest message. A lot of normal words are blocked and you cant even post a message with it - for example :""how new are you to the game"" - this sentence is flagged for some reason and cant be used. Insane. 
- You cannot leave a party if you are not a party leader. If you wanna leave, you need to close the game and reopen it. Imagine that. It is probably one of the worst designed interfaces I have ever seen in a game. 
- There are a lot of other lame things about the game and it is annoying that everything is so expensive and here for milking money from people - the audacity for asking so much while the game being in this beta state is crazy. And yes, I have spent about 70€ for nothing. So do not make the same mistake. 

Other than that - the game can be fun and I would like to see it succeed tbh. I absolutely love the concept and the style of it, but it needs further development.",1696600086,1707868665,False,0,0,0.495049476623535156,0,True,False,False

The fact that this game as a PvE mode is phenomenal, I can play a game I enjoy without the anxiety of playing against other players, I  can have my friends join with me for a few relaxing games, which is great. The characters are fun to play, it's the world of MHA which is fantastic, even if there is only one map, making it easily memorizable as to where everything is. There is a horrible glitch that if you only play with 1 other friend instead of 2,  the party will disband after every game  and you have to uninvite/reinvite them again every time. I am hoping this bug is fixed soon. Luckily, you can still level your battle pass/season pass through PvE as well, so you can at least enjoy some of the rewards. 

The cons of the PvE mode are pretty blatant right out of the gate - you cannot progress on ANY achievements or unlocking things through them.  No badges, no nothing. I understand that this might be for those that want to cheat and just grind out PvE games to rank further in PvP, but it's heavily unfair to those that just want to enjoy the PvE content.

The roll system is a total nightmare. You don't get ""pity"" rolls as you would find in Genshin where even if you roll individual rolls, you can eventually work your way up to a 2+ star, you can only seem to get the promised loot like this doing 10 rolls at once.  Which is hard, considering it costs 100 tickets to do so. This is also extremely difficult to achieve when doing PvE mode. Every new roll banner, you LOSE your exchange roll points, which the first week I found this out, I  was 180/200 to buying a character, imagine my agony in thinking I could keep these points to purchase a character on the banner I was working on or the next one. This reset is detrimental because it's lost currency and it feels like there is no reason in trying to obtain these points, unless you spend actual money for an overflow of them to buy what you want. Which, let's be honest, the prices for this game's pay-to-win are ridiculous for a gacha game.

I am heavily neutral about this game, I would neither recommend it nor not recommend it (even if steam is forcing me to choose this option), it depends on what you're looking for. It might be good from a PvP stance, I wouldn't know, but as a PvE player, it's there but lacking. I would like to be able to work on achievements and keep my points, as it's frustrating not feeling like I can progress anywhere, which makes the game stale after a while. I am sure the Dev team doesn't particularly care about the PvE section, and it shows, but I hope eventually they change a few things around  to make this game as great as I am sure it could be. It has potential, it can be fun when actually playing, but the surrounding aspects listed above make it difficult to want to stick around.

EDIT: It's come to the point where it's pay to win. You spend all hard earned tickets and get  items for characters you don't own and the rest are easy picks from other banners which are converted into essentially useless currency while rolling on special banners. Pity points are still taken away, making this game feel even more like a grind and less of a fun game to enjoy. I've been watching a lot of the community continue to ask for items/ranking/issues to be fixed that simply are not being met/addressed by the devs and instead they continue to present us with things we don't necessarily care about. Fortnite has the same style and at least you can get the characters and emotes you want for a fraction of the cost, along with more than just one map and playstyle.",1700598321,1704146430,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've watched the anime, binged it, cried tears over Deku's ambition and passionate drive to become a hero and finally I've played My Hero Rumble after excitedly waiting for it in earnest. I feel like I can now review this game.

This game unfortunately, does not share the ""PLUS ULTRA!!!"" energy that Deku and All-Might has. In layman's terms, this game needs more work. Let me tell you why; most characters are locked and you need to ""roll"" some sort of lottery game to unlock them. You can use these locked characters if you didn't unlock them but only for a limited time, like for three games. That's not the main problem either. The problem are the ABILITIES!!!

Hero abilities NEED BALANCING!!!! There are so many moments when I had full health and some shields, and then in 2-3 seconds, it would explode immediately because of a random Bakugo right clicking me. Another time when I was fighting an Uraraka player, and when they used their spin move, my full health and shields went so low so fast, I couldn't even say my grandma's name in time. Hero ""roles"" are so messed up, it doesn't make sense. Support heroes are often very weak unless they are backed by their team, and ""rapid"" heroes are SO FAST, IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP WITH THESE HEROES!

ONE MORE THING! ESCAPE! Escaping is a huge deal in battle royals, and this game YOU CANNOT ESCAPE AT ALL! Every hero as the same speed and since there is no ""stamina"", people can just follow anyone who is out of place and they will die. You can hide in a bush but there is often not a lot of places to hide, and since these bushes are made out of paper, anyone can run or walk through them with little difficulty and see you in the bush in 2-3 seconds flat. 

THE GAME NEEDS BALANCING, OR MARK MY WORDS IT WILL DIE!",1696630770,1696667179,False,5,0,0.522286176681518555,0,True,False,False

Theres a lot of people saying the game is pay to win but they only say that cause they don't understand or play the game enough. To clear things up the game is very much f2p friendly if not one of the most f2p games i have ever played. For starters if all event are the same you can get around 7k premium currency per event and we are given around 3 events per season. To put this into scale the battle pass is only 4.8k of that currency and a ten pull is 12k for the gacha. But at the same time just from logging in daily and completing all your missions on top of doing everything possible from the events you can easily get around 100 pulls as a  f2p a month. I have read about people complaining in regards to the gacha because some characters can only be obtained from the gacha and the pity is 200 pulls but what they don't know is that after the gacha is over you can unlock those characters with hero tickets which are easy to get as you only need hero souls for them and you get those from dup gacha summons. Overall the game is very friendly towards its  f2p players not to mention nothing is locked behind a pay wall and if you do want to use the gacha characters when they are brand new in the gacha you can use trial tokens up to 3 per day to play any character in game. Finally as for the complaints on leveling, after the xp buff and joining and agency you can expect about 1 level every 3 games and for those complaining about lack of maps they plan on adding more soon and not to mention they are currently working on cross-platform.",1696610016,1696610016,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,True,False

The people complaining about Gacha mechanics often think about the Genshin situation where a character than leaves the banner is not available anymore WHICH IS NOT THE CASE HERE. When the characters leave the banner they will be available with FREE Character Tickets. They have confirmed this on Twitter as well. Also they give you 5 Characters through the Free License system (battle pass but a permanent version). There is a regular battle pass of course thank you fortnite but still they are actively working and balancing a fun game. Some characters are stronger than others but in general most everyone is fun and you don't have to engage with Ranked if you don't want to. I personally have only purchased the $30 Pack and with playing the game I have all the characters except All Might (currently Account level 48 as of writing this) which you get with the License. 

Costume gacha is mostly what gacha is going to end up being because you will naturally obtain the characters. Also currently a bunch of recolors and the skins aren't fantastic but you can also purchase some of them with Hero Souls (duplicate currency) and some with Gold 

I give it a 8/10 it's not gonna be an e-sport anytime soon. But fun is what we play games for.
