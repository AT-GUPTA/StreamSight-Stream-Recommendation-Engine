Sadly, Steam apparently doesn't refund games that don't work. I suggest staying away from this game until the issue is fixed.

---

Since I couldn't get a refund and I did enjoy the game, I decided to keep playing it. I can mitigate the problem by quitting and reloading frequently. It seems more likely to actually save when I do, and when it doesn't, I don't lose as much progress. It's not a great work around but it does make the game playable. It still needs to be fixed, though.

Also, the developer replied to my comment and told me I could choose which save to reload from the menu, but that unfortunately doesn't help since the problem is caused by the game not saving. There's nothing for me to load.

Having played a fair amount of it in early access and starting a fresh save now it has officially released, I would want to say that it is definitely worth your time and attention.

I want to start with what are probably the strongest features of Entropy Effect, namely it’s combat and progression structures (both meta-progression and character progression in a run). Combat in this game has a very high potential skill ceiling and I think that comes from the fact that this is a spin-off title made with some of the assets of the Blazblue fighting game. As such, the characters you can select have a wide variety of moves that can lead to impressive combos, with higher level tactics like jump-cancelling allowing some truly outrageous strings of attacks. The characters all feel and look unique, and while you might certainly jive more with some over others, all of them are totally viable.

Combined with this, you have a progression in the forms of your Tactics, which provide buffs to your standard suite of skills and Potentials, which unlock entirely new moves for your character and can build synergies between them. While the variety of these synergies are not as broad or varied as other rogue-lites, adding them into an already extremely full kit means piloting the game itself is a joy. 

Meta-progression has taken cues from Hades by implementing what is essentially the Heat mechanic. You can take Entropy challenges to raise your difficulty levels, which at certain breakpoints provide additional benefits (additional shop refreshes, starting currency, etc) and refresh the “boss kill” count for your characters, as much like Hades, you only get a resource for killing a boss the first time with each character. These resources are spent to unlock passive bonuses that apply to a run, which have to be equipped and upgraded through a levelling process. It is all very intuitive and understandable and actually gives far stronger reason to play multiple characters and push the difficulty ever higher.

The setting is, as veterans of Blazblue in particular and anime in general will probably guess, cryptic and esoteric. The game does, however, do a good job of guiding you through with objectives to complete in each run which moves the general plot forward.

As a smaller point, but worth mentioning, the music is very good and has some great synthwave and electronic tracks, particular mention goes out to the Research Base theme and both NAN boss fight themes. NAN-01 in particular goes super hard, which is appropriate considering what an [i]absolute bitch[/i] that fight is.

After a handful more runs and hours into the new release, along with the continued updates almost daily from the developer, I feel this game is on it's way to being something special again. While I still feel like the combat feels a little stiffer and not as fluid like it felt in EA, to someone coming into it fresh -- it handles just fine. I feel I was a little too harsh on the changes and am having a decent time now. I'll own up to it being the ""change is bad"" mentality.

The devs seem to really care about the project, despite whatever is going on over there behind the scenes with layoffs and stuff. I look forward to more characters and updates, if they come. Give the game a shot, it is in a better state now. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1.0 Review Update)

After giving the new update a try, I have to say that am pretty disappointed. I'm not sure who the devs were listening to concerning features that players did/did not want, but whomever they listened to was wrong. My main issues right now are:


★ The selection of Rest/Event/Sortito/Etc stages in between maps feels off. Not going to that interim stage to pick them feels like a weird change. That was more fluid before, even if a bit redundant. (This is more of a personal gripe.)
★ The Potential system now feels unrewarding and not fun. Like an illusion of choice of now gutted baseline abilities.
★ The new Mind Potential setup feels like a very weak version of what was before.
★ The most egregious of all -- the combat. Combat is no longer fast and fluid like it was previously. It is now VERY clunky. Like, huh?? Maybe it's something they can iron out and was a mistake in the update, but it feels real bad now. 

It's like they ""fixed"" problems that weren't there and ended up just breaking them all instead. Some changes are weird and I could look past them, but the one I cannot is the combat. It just doesn't feel fun. It's hard to explain to those who have not played previously. It is just clunkier now.

In my opinion, the game was at it's best back in August/September 2023. The more updates they rolled out over time; the less I wanted to play. This update being the worst so far. I will watch out for updates and amend this review again, if changes are reverted/made. This game WAS very good and I hope the devs listen to the community and fix what wasn't broken before, but now is. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Early  Access Review)

I wanted to wait until I gave this game enough time to make a review, but I knew from the start how I'd rate it.

A little over 40hrs in with all achievements completed (something I rarely do), I can confidently say -- this game rules! I am not a huge roguelike person. I think I've played maybe like two or three total. I am not even a Blazblue person. I only recently picked up my first BB game (Centralfiction) on sale about a month before trying this out. The marriage between the two here though is something special.

I see a lot of complaints from BB fans that this isn't a ""true BB game"" and I can see how that's disappointing to them, but I think that is selling this game real short. It's fun. The game is REAL fun! Like you remember when games used to just be fun and replaying them over and over was never really boring? That's how I felt/feel playing this.. and it's not even out of Early Access.

The visuals speak for themselves, so I don't feel I need to explain how great and crisp they are. The story is kinda hit or miss. I'm interested, but not really the selling point for me. The gameplay, though.. each character feels so fluid and right. Each one feels distinct enough to impact your choice. I enjoy the different systems in the game (Evotype, Tactics, Potentials, Entropy/Corruption) and each run feels different enough and enjoyable to mix and match abilities to see what I can accomplish with my given choices for said run. 

There are some faults, for sure. Some of the bosses/enemies are either super easy or tough as nails. I don't consider myself a reflex god or anything, but I feel like the difficulty is fine, albeit on a weird curve. Definitely inconsistent and something I'd like to see more balanced throughout the different modes. I do hope to see more changes and tweaks as the development continues. I am hopeful of future content/updates; especially to try out new characters/maps/bosses... anything! I want more!

This game is really, really good. Not perfect, but really good. The artwork is beautiful and the OST is an absolute bop, but there is the occasional bug and quirky grammatical error from time to time, but nothing too major.

Positives:
The combat in this game is incredibly in-depth, and it WILL make you feel like an absolute bad ass, on top of that, all the animations are really well made, they all look super cool, elegant, brutal, or whatever it is trying to convey, and the sheer power of the attacks is inflicted well not only in the visuals but also in the sound effects, which further sells this bad ass feeling. 
Each of the (currently) 10 characters in the roster are wildly different from each other, and they are all super fun to play, so much so that I genuinely can't decide on who is the most fun. 
There are so many different layers to the systems of this game, you can have up to 6 buffs at the start of a run that give you things like extra heals or more damage after a special move. Some of these buffs are kinda niece, but others are really helpful (such as the extra heals). There are loads of little bonuses you can get during a run, those being Tactics and Buffs. Tactics are big buffs that add new things to any character, such as spawning a bunch of icicles that shoot themselves at nearby enemies. There are a ton of different elements that Tactics can be, and there are Tactics that combine buffs from 2 elements (think the duo boons from Hades). Buffs are just some handy little bonuses, like gaining extra money if you clear a room without taking damage. There are also Potentials, which provide significant change to your characters moveset, revamping current attacks and/or adding new attacks, or sometimes they will buff your mobility options. 
Speaking of mobility, the movement in this game is really smooth, and it just feels right. You have 2 jumps and an airdash that you can use in any order, and if you jump during a dash, the momentum carries over into your jump, allowing for crazy combos that bring the enemies from one side of the room to the other. 
The difficulty is very customizable, it starts really easy, but you can add many different things to ramp up the difficulty.
I still have more that I could say, but I'd just be rambling even more than I am already.

Negatives:
Most of the negatives in this game are minor, but they are there. 
The translations that were made from Chinese to English aren't the greatest at times, and so certain ability descriptions may not be super clear, and the dialogue from NPC's can sound a little goofy at times. Depending on how you feel about these tiny little errors, this could be a positive, personally I don't really care.
There are some minor bugs from time to time, such as attacks not functioning as intended (this rarely happens), lag spikes (that might just be my PC tho), and one time the game didn't bring me to the character select and froze, don't know what that was about.
The story is definitely good, don't get me wrong. But the whole BlazBlue part of the game has nothing to do with the story. The game does say that it is it's own world with it's own story, but it really is just that. It is it's own unique game, and it just so happens that you can play as some of the BlazBlue characters (if you wanted to get really nit picky about it, you could argue that you technically don't play as them, as you are a cute little robot thing doing a simulation).
Besides these, there aren't really any negatives (to me, at least)

Overall, if you have ~$20 and want a good time, I would highly suggest giving this game a try, as it will most likely give you hours of enjoyment

Also, they are adding more modes for you to play with your friends, right now there is a PvPvE mode, but they are gonna add multiplayer to the PvE mode, and I think a designatied PvP mode as well, but don't count on that last one as I don't entirely remember.",1708412822,1708412822,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

However the core roguelike mechanics are a bit underwhelming: exploration is almost non existing and you always play the same biomes with only two different bosses in each phase. Every run feels pretty much the same with just a bit of customization and personal preference instead of randomness and adaptation.

The difficulty system is a bit weird with custom modifiers but its only incentive is to grind a currency that losess its purpose very quickly.

I see other reviews complaining that this is not a Blazblue game and if you bought it without figuring what was in store for you on your own, the game doesn't deserve a negative review because you couldn't be bothered to look at it first. If you are just whining it isn't Blazblue and leave a negative review, that is stupid. I really feel like this is the typical Final Fantasy complaining about how they changed the formula and the ""true fans"" couldn't accept that they wanted to branch out and try new things, or did literally anything differently. Go and play the games you are so obsessed with if that is the case and stop leaving negative reviews on games like this where developers did a good job.

Now for the gameplay.
A fun rogue-lite with a number of characters and combos to make. The effects you can make through the tactics and potentials feel good while not being too complex if you don't want it to be. With modifiers to change the difficulty if you want, it can get rough pretty fast. Bosses get much easier with practice but getting better with characters and their strengths still feels fun after many runs. I love how different the characters are too.

But now? Nowadays, this game is genuinely one of more preferred rougelikes to go back to. You can see the Devs take inspiration from other rouge likes such as Hades, and implementing mechanics and making them work in this game. 

A lot of optimization was done as well,  it lags a lot less and the UI has been greatly improved. Levels load much faster and the characters feel much more unique and fleshed out. Even the story was fleshed out, and the voice actors all did great jobs (both the blazblue characters and the cast involved in the story).

If the game was a 5/10 on release and easily forgettable, now it is a 7 or 8 out of 10, maybe even bordering on a 9 (though that's a stretch). Highly recommend buying it if you want to experience a satisfying gameplay and visual experience for a dozen hours or two

Entropy Effect is fantastic, it has some incredibly fun characters that all feel super unique! The items you can collect during a run also feel very good and can make for some fun builds and combinations with certain characters.

The biggest warning I have for this game is that if you are looking for a story that has anything to do with Blazblue, this just is not it, the story alone is good and would not say its bad... but this game has nothing to do with Blazblue other then the characters. (Still though it feels awesome to be playing as Blazblue characters!)

There is sadly no Co-Op PVE however PVP is in this game but it's super slow and delayed and not balanced well and while it feels like it has a lot of potential, it's just not in a state right now where its any real good, but the developers have said that they will be adding a Co-Op PVE mode somewhere down the line in the future and focusing more on PVE so its safe to say that the PVP just should not be considered when buying this game.

The interesting part of the depth of the combat is that each run builds you into it as you unlock potentials which can change your play style from run to run in ways that do not seem obvious at first. The mixing and matching of different runs provides a ton of variety with dynamic customization options. It's super smart how it's done! Trust.
My only complaint is that some unlocks seem to be locked behind an extraction mode that is not for me. Played it once, and decided i would likely never do it again, which is somewhat frustrating since that is the part that allows some co-op. However, I don't know that it would be worth the annoyance I feel playing this mode.

I feel like the game is a bit unbalanced; spaces 1-4 are very easy, but then Space Omega is very difficult. I can easily clear 1-4 in under 4 minutes, but always time out in Space Omega (even with ignoring all the monsters). The time limit is frustrating for a procedurally generated stage. In addition to Susanoo being much harder than every other boss, this makes completing a run very difficult. Susanoo has poor visual clarity compared to the other bosses with rectangle hitbox indicators. The game also doesn't explain the tactics system very well; what is ascension vs upgrading? Dodging also doesn't feel rewarding because I can dodge the initial attack, but then get hit by another in end-lag. The time system is also never explained, I was left wondering why I was taking so much tick damage.

Other than trying all the prototypes and different builds, I don't really see much replayability now. I don't feel incentivized to max out entropy, to upgrade mind crystals, or to try different builds. Just due to Space Omega, I feel like mobility builds (extra dash, more aerial attacks, more i-frames) are extremely favorable.

On a more positive note, I absolutely adore the visuals of this game. From the brilliant base design to subtle lighting engine to the flashy and cohesive kits of each prototype, this is a great game for anyone who loves anime-esque stylized graphics. The combat also feels very fluid and is satisfying when you can clear waves without taking any hits. I think the world needs more platforming action games and this game is a great reason why.

  - You like the visual style. You get what you see on the store page, and it's consistent and high quality throughout the game. It's sidescrolling Hades with Japanese animated fighting game style.
  - You thought Hades was a bit too hard to get into. The baseline difficulty of BBEE is much easier than Hades, but you unlock a lot of difficulty tweaks pretty early on in the game. BBEE is also very generous in giving the player tools, skills, buffs, and heals compared to Hades.
  - You find bad translations charming more than distracting. It's not the worst I've ever seen but it feels like google translate did most of the work. I feel bad for the voice actors forced to read the awkward and often silly voicelines, but ultimately thought of it as a cute quirk than a true flaw of the game.

I'd say theme and style are the biggest reasons to buy this game because that's really what it does best. In terms of mechanics and gameplay there are just a lot of games out there that do it better.

I was able to beat the final boss on my fifteenth run, but I would say the game's baseline difficulty is equivalent to an easy mode and you'll need to turn on the Entropy system (difficulty options) to play it at a more serious difficulty. Someone skilled with combat systems like this one could probably beat it sight unseen on their third or fifth run.

I actually found the skill system to be more interesting than Hades, maybe just as a result of having a lot more interplay between different trees and synergies between character skillsets and acquired skills. The other side of that is that once you find a couple of strong combos you can pretty easily build a god run to steamroll through the game. The Legacy systems lets you pick and keep up to four skills from previous runs to start as many new runs as you like with.

The game does a good job of rewarding you for learning enemy attack patterns and is very generous with iframes so if you're locked in you will feel invincible. The downside is that the game is extremely visually busy, which means that even though enemies give you three different telegraphs sometimes you'll still miss the warning and take a hit if you can't see through the visual effects soup covering your screen.

The character design is exactly what it looks like. A smattering of fighting game-style Anime characters fitting some common character tropes. One thing I appreciated was that female characters are modestly dressed (for a video game) and well voiced so it doesn't look or sound like you're playing a hentai when play as a female character.

Overall the game has a clear idea of what it wants to be and what's important to it, and I definitely feel a sense of care and quality put into by the developers. It falls short here and there, and it's not going to win game of the year, but if you like what you see you are very likely to get more of it and the experience will be overall worth your time.

I deliberately waited for 1.0 and I'm glad I did.  The gameplay loop is pretty fun, and advancing your character is pretty cool too.  Though I was way more interested in the potential upgrades over tactics upgrades.  And being able to carry over certain tactics from one character to the next is a super cool idea too.  The actual combat is the biggest draw though.  The vast majority of characters feel real fun to fight with.  I feel like the combat is closest to Dead Cells, but even more evolved.  A lot of the tools that characters had in Calamity Trigger are present, but the execution of those things have been reduced down to command normals, as fighting terms go.  You don't get complex combo routes, but you are allowed enough expression for it not to feel bad.

I will say that I didn't really feel much of a reason to keep doing runs after completing the story.  I mean, there's the mind challenges, but once I got to the red ""advanced"" challenges, it got a bit too annoying to have to do an ENTIRE run just for another attempt at one boss.  Also, from the achievement side, some of them are just too annoying or time consuming to attempt.  Also, the two soritio achievements are bugged.  I probably got both 3 times each over my time with the game, and it still never popped, which is a bit disappointing.

I'm not a stranger to rogue-likes and other tangential off-shoots. I am however new to BlazBlue IP, from the stand point of owning or playing any of the titles. I'm aware of them, I have just never played them.

This game has sparked an interest in the franchise and for the game itself, I find it thoroughly enjoyable in all aspects. Above all, the gameplay is very fun, potentials for each character feel and look great and adds a lot of replay value, both fun and cool factor. Tactics add some fun combos and I have many more of the duo's yet to unlock. I like the ability to specifically target a build that you might want to try, create, and keep. The gameplay is also very smooth. I've played on both my mouse & keyboard, and also controller. Controller feels more natural, but m&kb also work just as well.

The graphics are crisp. The OST is enjoyable and fits with the theme of the game & it's levels.

I'm looking forward to the co-op, any new characters and updates in general that they plan on adding. This is a really solid game and seems like there's more room for expansion to make it even better.

If this doesn't deter you I wholeheartedly recommend picking this game up if you're into roguelikes with tons of character featuring wildly different movesets, as there's currently 10 (as of writing this review). In terms of difficulty, this one's on the easier side (even on hard mode, which merely reduces the amount of healing and revives you start with), but the game does offer you the Heat-mechanic from Hades (picking differing modifiers which increase difficulties for more rewards).",1708046333,1708046333,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game however offers something different, yes it does give you boost but I don't feel all that balance breaking if you don't understand the mechanics. 

The best feature of this game lies in the character customization. The character build options are near endless:

[b]There are 14 potentials[/b] per character and you only get to about 4-5 of them per full run and it changes how the character plays; basic attack, dash, aerial skill and combination of those four abilities changes how you can play the same character differently each playthrough.

At this point of the build there are about [b]200+ traits[/b] across 8 different elements, support and dual element to pick per level up to modify the above mentioned abilities your character. Fire for example can either have homing fire bolts at intervals, or ring of fire every few seconds or whenever you use a skill or burn on basic attack of dash through your enemies. 

Finally, there's a [b]legacy system[/b] where you can use your previous run character, to augment your character with their powers and one trait they picked up from their runs. 

I never played the fighting game franchise so I don't know how much of the lore is related to this game at all and the lorelovers would the franchise would say this is just fan baiting and offers nothing to the storyline of the game world itself. I can't say much about this and since this is still in its early access when I wrote this, I look forward to what they will do to the plot itself.

--- FR Review ---

The game is completely different now and I still recommend it for the updates they have done! 

1. Scaling Difficulty - now instead of you dealing with the level of entropy her stages, you can set them up at the very start to set up what kind of effects you would get throughout the stages. I am currently trying to beat Entropy 100 and it's unforgiving game while at lower entropy you feel like godlike at times when you get the right tactics and potentials.
2. Responsive and slightly forgiving than the EA - Newer characters are far more responsive and fluid than the earlier characters (Es Jin and Taokaka) they game also feel they've relaxed a bit more on the dodge reactions to reward you for dodging attacks. 
3. more tactics - they added lot more advanced tactics for you to test with what kind of build you can make and they are adding more so I am looking forward to them.

Cons:
- Severely lacking a compelling storyline.
- Terrible explanations of mechanics and upgrades.
- Confusing UI and Menu
- Poor wording and descriptions of abilities and buffs
- Extra features that are pointless without a larger playerbase (online PvPvE)
- Kind of boring/uninspiring upgrades (Lightning, Fire etc... very basic) and no story as to where these bonuses come from.
- No real story driver to get ton he final boss (see Hades)

Pros:
- Insanely amazing combat
- Stunning visuals and art style
- Top Tier movement
- Really cool Evotype mechanic
- Cool abilities
- Cool characters
- Good voice acting
- Decent enemy variety
- Fun boss fights
- Challenging
- Great customization

Summary: If BlazBlue added a storyline here, and a goal (even if superfluous) as to why you need to upgrade/reach the end boss, cleaned up the descriptions of upgrades, added explanations for all of the different mechanics in a codex (eg. What is a Killstreak?), and was a bit more creative in regards to the upgrades (maybe they come from certain legendary Evotypes, or BlazBlue characters or robots who try to help you along the way etc), I think the game would be a lot more popular. As it stands it's purely a game for Roguelite enthusiasts who like pressing buttons (like myself), but adding more story elements would draw a much larger audience and get much more engagement.",1708007521,1708007521,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Extremely fluid controls, feels just like an extension of the BlazBlue universe should. Not only have they translated the fighting styles, of some prolific characters from throughout the series, into fitting the format of a rogue-like game, it also has a very compelling story-line/progression system that rewards your growing mastery of characters by letting you save perks from past runs to start on subsequent attempts; overall familiar mechanics for anyone returning or who is familiar with the genre make it a very reasonably priced and engaging Rogue-like with great looking graphics and cut-scenes, as to be expected from the series!",1706941148,1707947285,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The update resulted in the loss of my saved data and all my progress. The updated version now has english voice acting, which is nice, but i'm getting a feeling that the story might not be substantive. The update changed many mechanics and ui elements in a way that makes user experience less intuitive, while also removing the entropy mechanic resulting in less satisfying game play. This results in the game feeling clunkier than its previous version due to the more menus and npcs that take up time between what used to be a highly rewarding and engaging game play loop. With the removal of entropy the risk / reward element of BlazBlue Entropy Effect (BBEE) is muted resulting in a more bland game play experience. 

I'm going to keep playing for a bit, hopefully things improve as I progress. I would previously have rated BBEE around a 8-10/10, it was quick to jump into, intuitive, and had a polished style with the entropy mechanic to make it stand out. 

After the recent update... its mid... 4-6/10 solid game, combat and style are still great, but the game isn't as interesting without entropy, it feels clunkier, and the increased amount of time spent in combat when going for something like a Potential upgrade feels less fun as it removes a break from the combat loop. The change to the Potential selector is a great example of how the ui got clunkier, I would have prefer Potential rooms to have not change, though I would have included a button that would let you go more into detail.

The game is still fun, but I kinda feel like I was baited and had the product switched on me, I would prefer to play the older version.

Status update 14Feb2024: Although I enjoyed the early access features greatly, the 1.0 release does make the player more control over the difficult, I appreciate this greatly even if I enjoyed the chaos of the early access entropy management.

While there is some meta-progression upon death, I think thats the area that is weakest for this game so far.   Overall, awesome game, highly recommend.

EDIT:  Updating my review after version 1.0 was released.  Really sucked to have everything you got reset, but I can live with that.  I also don't really mind the changes to the potentials/synergies/traits.  I think the most unfortunate change was to the combat, which is what changes my review to a negative one.  Not sure what they did between now and EA, but the combat feels a lot worse than what it was.  Hits don't feel as satisfying anymore, and the feedback isn't there anymore.  I also don't think the bosses and difficulty are scaled properly anymore because every boss is easy (even on the first run), with a massive ramp up in difficulty for the final battle.  Before, each boss was its own obstacle to overcome and you could tell you were becoming better at the game the further you got.  

If they can get the combat back to what it was, I will change back to positive review.  Still a fun game, but now just too easy and not as satisfying to keep you playing long term.

EDIT 2:  Changing my review back to positive after some patches and changes made.  The gameplay is still fluid and they went back and gave earned rewards to EA users which helped a ton.  No longer feels like I'm starting over, and the gameplay is still fluid.  Combat is still not as good as it was in EA, but after taking a break and coming back, it still is one of the better combat roguelites out there.",1692639985,1707874012,True,0,0,0.525040388107299805,0,True,False,True

Much like many others, I'm also not particularly fond of the changes. The game was more enjoyable before and now you guys have made it convoluted for absolutely no reason at all.

None of us, not a single SOUL, asked for these changes. How are you going to release a statement leading up to the 1.0 release, talking about how you're proud of your team and thankful to all the players helping you reach 'Overwhelmingly Positive', then turn around and do this? THIS is how you repay us for supporting you during Early Access?

Look, we were fine with you guys telling us ""your save data is getting erased"", even if it was a tough pill to swallow, but enough is enough. You've gone too far. Revert the game back to its previous form. I guarantee you the reviews will go back up to Overwhelmingly Positive and people will begin praising it once more.

During Early Access days, I encouraged a lot of my friends to pick up the game and some of them actually did, and ended up enjoying it. Now that the 1.0 update has dropped, I'll be telling people to avoid it from now on, at least until you fix it, 91Act. You had a solid game in your hands already.

We didn't need the ""mind crystals"", we didn't need the ""slots"" for silly modules/parts or whatever the hell this is. And we SURE as hell didn't need you to remove the HP Mixture upgrade. I was fine with the base HP you had for each character. I don't care about increasing my HP over 100%+. I want my multiple HP Mixtures back.

I also shouldn't have to worry about getting screwed out of a Potential because you guys decided to give us DUPLICATES during a run. I finished a stage earlier and every last one of the Potentials were the same except for the effect on them, leaving me NO room for variation with my build.

Again, NOBODY asked for this. I liked being able to decide if I wanted X, Y, or Z when it popped up. I NEVER had to worry about getting a duplicate Potential with a different effect on it before.

As of writing this on January 31st, 2024, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game. If 91Act actually decides to backpedal and listens to the community's feedback (like they said they would), and reverts the changes made with 1.0, then I'll change my review. Until then though, I would advise any new player to avoid this game for now and spend your money elsewhere.

EDIT as of 2/13/2023:

Fortunately, after a couple of weeks now, it looks like 91Act is turning things around and has decided to listen to the community's feedback regarding version 1.0. Every patch they've been pushing out has been adjusting and tweaking things to make it feel better. I decided to try it again tonight and the game plays better (Jin felt weak in 1.0, but they fixed that), the quality of life features are improving, and they added back additional HP mixtures like we were used to in Early Access days.

They recently announced another new character is on the way and they're also preparing additional QoL features, a co-op for PvE mode/mind training, a boss rush mode, and additional content in the future. Unfortunately, shortly after reading this announcement, I also read that 91Act was forced to layoff employees, so I hope this doesn't have an impact on the development of the game, but we'll see what happens.

The Good Stuff.
This game can have no story and I would still love it. It's that good. Not to say anything bad about the story, but the combat is really where this game is at for me. I've only tried 7 out of the 10 characters currently available, but all of them feel very unique.

The combat of this game is very fluid. The combination of abilities (ICE SUPREMACY) and combos when you character unlocks additional moves is just amazing. The weight of the action is well done. Characters that are agile feel agile and can zoom around while characters like Hakumen feel heavy and strong. It is very enjoyable. Dragging enemies from left to right, blasting them, freezing them, and just whaling on them feels very good on this game. Every character needs Jin's Time Stasis. Hahaha.

There's also the Legacy Tactics you can create. I really like this system. You have to grind a fair bit to get the 4 ""tactics"" or the elemental modifiers you want to start with to make the run consistent. That's a really good option for a roguelike. You have the option to make some stuff consistent because the combat of this game is so good.

My highest is Entropy 70 and even if the game gets harder, there are perks in exchange for the difficulty like making the run more consistent with additional ""potential"" or ability refreshes. I have not enabled the debuff though, but if you want to run it you either equip the perk that removes 3 debuffs when you rest or no hit an elite enemy to remove said debuffs. That or spend points at the shop to have it removed.

For higher Entropy though I would not be reducing the potential selection because at that point you're just battling with RNG and there's no point because the potentials make or break the run at higher difficulties because of the increased hp and time limit.

The Bad Stuff.
The bosses are not equal in terms of the time constraint. There are bosses with phases where you cannot hit them and they waste time. Those are annoying because there's a difficulty modifier that at the highest sets the time limit per Stage/Map to 4 minutes. You have bosses like Sweeper and NAN FIRE BIT that have these phases where you cannot hit them.

Oh and the most difficult boss of this game is not even the final boss at the highest difficulty with the third phase and all the other moves. It's Floating Mind. This boss also has three phases, but the third phase is just broken. There's 8 lasers spinning around the map that can destroy the platforms your character is stepping on so if you are using a melee character, they better have good aerial attacks. Also a time waster because the lasers melt your hp and the two starfish looking boss spins around for a long long time.

I guess it is part of the RNG, but the starting stage has two possible bosses and one you can defeat in 20 seconds or lower and the other has a 10+ second invulnerable phase. The one with an invulnerable phase also has an attack you cannot really just ignore because if do not avoid it a certain way, most of the floor will get burned.

Anyway, the time limit is the only reason why this is a bit annoying, but if there's no such thing I would be fine even if certain bosses have invulnerable phases. Still do not like Floating Mind though.

I have no complaints with the normal stages. It's fun and catch you off guard at times, but nothing really annoying or broken.",1707774953,1707774953,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I should mention that I haven't tried the multiplayer at all, so I cannot comment on that part of the game.

In any case, the change in genre does mean a simplified fighting system (they thankfully didn't go the Guilty Gear Isuka route), so the attack set and combo capability are a bit more limited compared to mainline BlazBlue, but that's a sacrifice well worth making for getting the characters to fit into a new genre, and they still feel like pretty good representations of the characters from the fighting games.

Aside from the characters being relatively faithful to their fighting game coutnerparts, the most unique part of this game is probably the evotype legacy system (though other games may have a similar system). After each run, you get a character evotype saved. At the beginning of each run, you can pick up to two evotypes to add to your abilities. Evotypes have a couple of abilities that are default to them, and at the end of each run you can pick up to two (depending on your score) elemental abilities that you acquired during the run to add to that evotype. This means you can create builds, of a sort, in a meta-progression fashion, where you play characters and pick abilities to try to create different legacy ability sets to start runs with.

It's notable that one of the default legacy abilities on each evotype are active abilities with their own buttons. So Hakumen, for example, gives you a block-counterattack ability, and λ-11  gives you a summon of what's essentially a blade turret. You cannot pick an evotype of a character you're using, so you can't pick a Hakumen evotype if you're playing as Hakumen. You also can't double up on a single character's evotype, so you can't run double Hakumen for double counters.

Anyway, aside from that, it's a mostly standard roguelite action platformer in structure. It does have the weird quirk of being room-based up until the last zone, in which it opens a metroidvania-like map. Normally rooms award you for clearing them, but the last area structure entirely changes that, since there's no rooms to clear to get awards from (aside from bosses). That said, it does have two optional bosses, which do reward you for beating them, and there's a shop that has items that you can buy multiple times for upgrades (that increase in price each purchase).

The game also has allows you to increase difficulty by picking modifiers from the game lobby, as you progress more and more with more modifiers applied, more modifiers are unlocked. You can do stuff like add time limits, increase enemy damage, increase enemy HP, increase trap damage, obfuscate rewards, reduce reward options, add new boss patterns/attacks, and so on. This is on top of the fact that there's a normal and hard mode (not sure of the difference, aside from that normal gives you more health items and a respawn at the start of each run).

Anyway, if you wanted an anime fighter turned into an action platformer, you should give this game a look. It does what it sets out to do excellently.

5/10 at best.
Let me try to sum it up.
This game suffers firstly from having extremely lack of 'impact' feeling on hits, or I could simply just say the combat is not fun. Combat/gameplay feels paperthin at best when hitting through mobs (I would say smashing through but that would imply theres a good feeling to it, or some form of impact when you beat through enemies.) 
The bar for roguelites must be set pretty low at this point if people are heralding it this high. When the highlight of the literal dopamine rush of the game you're playing is coming from the selection of a new perk or tactic or potential, whatever you wanna call them in this and how they are categorized, thats a problem. The main point of this game is that it has BlazBlue characters as your playable cast, right? Sounds great on paper. It doesn't translate that well when you know BlazBlue made extensive use of its 4 button combat in the fighters, leading you to probably be confused if you picked it up hoping to play a fun singleplayer blazblue roguelite. The upgrades for finding the rest of your character's moveset during a run are few and far in between, likely for balance because they are what allow you to actually have a bit more fun and control with your character, as you should have from the beginning. Characters that don't translate well at all from that like Kokonoe leave much to be desired in gameplay, outside of the already lackluster feeling of 'hitting' something. I use the word hitting lightly because it honestly feels like paper being pressed against sand. 

Let's talk about enemies.
Poor placement combined with random armored enemies with very bad 'tells' for when they are about to do their armored big attack suck. The boss patterns and their tells are awful. Some of the bosses like the 'Tree Guardian' make me wonder how long this game was even playtested or who thought 'yeah, this is fun, right?' It makes little sense and alot of the gameplay design feels counter-intuitive. 

Music:
What about it? Throw on your own, listening to a random ambient video of nature on youtube while playing is more exciting. I understand that roguelites are meant to be a bit more atmospheric in nature for soundtrack because the game is meant to be played in a long term, with short bursts being your runs, no matter how long they last. I've heard birdchirps out of my window more exciting then this game's OST.

Story:
don't bother. the premise makes sense and it gets a thumbsup in that department, they made up a story that was decently fitting enough to have you 'selecting' to play as the characters. it works but at the end of the day none of it matters and leaves nothing to pull you in. it would have been more exciting if a blazblue character was worked into the story somehow and you were trying to stop them or their timeline or what have you, but I'll spare you further exposition in this department.

Its BlazBlue characters slapped over an honestly mostly mediocre engine. It feels like dust in the wind when you hit things unless you are completely pummeling through a giant amount of enemies with an entire character's kit unlocked. Alot of them don't translate well from the original fighting game series if you are familiar with it, like how Jin's 'skill' in this is his projectile super, but Mai's 'skill' is just her Drive. I understand its for balancing purpose but even when you get their unlocked moves in a run it just feels like it should have been there from the start, along with something that feels satisfying to hit enemies. You don't send them flying. There is no feeling of impact. Hitting enemies feels no different then just swinging your normals, only difference is they have a health bar.

For as much as I love BlazBlue, roguelites, 2D action, I do not recommend this game. Its boring. Spend your 25 USD elsewhere. The online is a broken joke not to mention. I don't even know how they snuck the tag Metroidvania on this game.

A really cool part of the game is the characters - 10 unique playstyles with vibrant personalities. People are complaining about the story, I find it fine, also it's not connected to the previous BlazBlue games, so for a newcomer, I didn't feel excuded(maybe it's a bad thing for BlazBlue fans?).

 Someone chimes in: "" should we maybe start working on the level and world design?""

Pros:
Mechanics-wise, very good. It's the game 'Blade Assault' wanted to be. Build variety is very nice, with characters who completed/failed runs becoming future buffs your next run can employ. The ""mind challenge"" system is really interesting, with the game saving your previously played characters, with their whole build, for ""challenge runs"". This is very refreshing, and gives this action-roguelike a ""deckbuilding"" aspect I've yet to see in others like it.  

Cons:
The Blazblue licensing really irks me here. As a GG/BB fan, the characters are so obviously tacked on top of something completely not meant for them it hurts. Their general personality, themes and mechanics are spot-on and translated very well to a side-scroller, but the game's overall ""neon aesthetic"" mixed with BlazBlue kills it for me. 

I can never let go of the fact that if the BB roster weren't in this game, [i] not a thing would change [/i]. And I mean not a single thing. Mechanics would be the same, artstyle would be the same, the game would still be good. BB fans who expect the story to be meaningful, beware: it isn't, just play your favorite BB character and be happy they are here with their whole animations, supers and overall theme very well adapted.

TLDR: Fun as fuck, fast-paced, straightforward approach to RLs, but BlazBlue lore has no place here, making the BB characters feel ""out-of-place"". I also think the game's original story could be presented in a much better way. I've lost so many story beats bc I blasted my way through a few runs and did ""too well"", making it so I had to watch like 8 or 10 cutscenes and ""audio-calls"" back-to-back. I found it very disengaging. Maybe if a little bit more of Blazblue aesthetics and lore got put into the game, I'd call it perfect.",1707669246,1707669246,True,1,0,0.514285683631896973,0,True,False,False

----------------------------------------------------
This is a very strange premise for a game. You don't play as actual BlazBlue characters, but you do mind training and use BlazBlue  characters as some sort of memory/shell/figment. Apparently, it's also tied to the BlazBlue lore somehow, but I can't even understand the basic BlazBlue plot despite playing it for over a decade.

In gameplay terms, this is a Dead Cells-y roguelike where you pick a character and buff them throughout the run. If you're familiar with BlazBlue, this will feel like some crazy joy ride because you have things like Hakumen doing a Yukikaze and slashing 5 times in quick succession while enhanced with super armor.

It is also very slick and stylish. It has a sort of cyber aesthetic going, but not ""neon"" and more just ""we really like hexagons and diamonds"" cyberpunk.

All in all, I like it. It's just weird, but not bad weird, more ""I don't understand what they were going for and why this is BlazBlue-related, but I dig it.""",1707401873,1707657304,True,6,0,0.591858029365539551,0,True,False,False

- The combat is juicy, responsive and has enough ""oomph"" to keep you entertained
- The variety of playable characters is good and they are distinct enough to play
- The upgrade and combo system leaves nothing to be desired and so far (14hours) all runs felt fresh and unique
- Combining different ""elements"" e.g. fire+umbra, or lightning+Blade gives another nice touch and i still havent found all different combinations there are
LONG TERM:
I finished the ""story"" with 14 hours played, it took me 21 runs, each run between 10-35 minutes. There is a challenge mode where you face bosses from the game and after each one you manage to bet, the next one gets stronger. You pick a character that you have played during one of your runs, which lets you ""relive"" your experience: OP chars that you got to build during one run are not lost and are thus brought back from the dead so to speak ;). I will probably hit the 20h mark in this game and its very good bang for bucks with the high level of polished visuals.
In between runs you can:
-  purchase upgrades (you can socket 6-upgradable passive utility effects and upgrade %-max HP)
- watch short, surprisingly well-made story cinematics
- talk to some NPCs
- set a difficulty level similar to HEAT from Hades, but in BlazBlue you also get positive perks from increasing difficulty, new rooms will appear, attack patterns from bosses will change completly, you get more potions or Upgrade variants to choose from (the downside is of course higher than the upside, but this adds a long-term touch to the game and i just scratched the surface with entropy-level 10 of 45)

When I randomly saw this game (had no idea it was in production) which had the tag ""BlazBlue"" which happens to be one of my favorite fighting games, it was a no brainer for me. Bias aside, ill tell you dear reader, why this isnt just a fan service game, but an actual competent rogue game.

Firstly, the character diversity alone, should be a draw for some, even if you are unfamiliar with the cast.

The devs differentiated the characters and loaded the hell out of them with move sets, which you acquire through obtaining ""Potential""
This is a huge reason why the game is so fun imo, it allows you to feel the power increase at you choice, it is very satisfying at times to recieve a specific potential that just sets your build off.
Secondly to supplement that, they have ""traits"" which further adds to the complexity.

I love complex choices and deep gameplay. For me, this game delivers HUGE on that. 

This game is fluid, every character feels super unique and once you learn them, the traits do as well.

Also, the starting screen where you just sit there and the music is playing, is fucking amazing. I literally just left it on last night when i was just hanging because of the blue light ambience and the music.

For me personally, this game is close to perfect. Its not just an awesome BlazBlue game.. its a phenomenal roguelike.

생각보다 재밌게 즐기고 있어서 간단하게 후기 남김

- 24년 2월 공식 출시 이후 기준 

- 이제 일본어 음성 지원해서 재밌게 하는중

- 기본적으로 영어는 읽을줄 알아야 제대로 플레이 할 수 있는데 
개인적으로 어차피 옵션 제한 켜두고 하면 막상 읽을거리도 없어서 언어장벽이 겜하는데 지장이 클지는 모르겠음
**생각해보니 스킬 해금하고 설명 읽을라면 필요하긴함.. *

솔직히 택틱은 안읽어도 대충 이미지 + 레어도 보고 뽑아도 문제없고
어차피 게임 난이도 옵션에서 선택 제한 켜놓으면 스킬, 택틱 선택지 다 제한되고 하나로 고정이라

초반 퀘스트 다 깨서 캐릭터 전부 해금하고나면 
걍 캐릭터 돌려가며 스테이지 반복하는거라 스토리도 뭐 없고

전체적으로 캐릭터 스킬도 화려하고 타격감도 좋고 원작 스킬 구현도 잘 돼있음

게임은 로그라이크처럼 캐릭터 기본 셋으로 시작해서 포텐셜, 택틱 카드 수집으로 스킬, 보조 스킬을 강화해나가는 방식임

캐릭터 종류도 많고 개성이 달라서 같은 스테이지를 돌아도 생각보다 재밌음

개인적으로 택틱은 전설급으로 강화해도 체감이 안돼서 모르겠음
차라리 포텐셜만 최대한 뽑아서 스킬 늘리는게 체감이 가장 잘 됨

난이도는 노말, 하드 있고 

인게임 옵션으로 이것저것 제한하거나 적 체력, 피격 뎀지 보스 강화 등, 설정할 수 있는데 
강화켜두면 보스들 스킬이 무난하게 회피 가능한 것에서 난이도가 올라감

게임을 진행하면 캐릭터 기록이 남고 그 캐릭터 기록을 통해 이후 2개까지 보조 스킬을 설정할 수 있음
패드 기준 LT RT
대부분 깡 공격기지만 
하쿠멘처럼 카운터, Es처럼 회피시 반격 기믹, 진의 CC기 등 제공하는 스킬도 차이가 있어서 소소하게 재밌음

캐릭 밸런스는 취향차이도 있고, 장단점, 개성이 확실해서 전체적으로 잘 잡힌것 같음 

코코노에 같이 정말 재미도 인기도 없지만 또 보스전은 기가막히게 잘 날먹한다던가

지상전은 별로였는데 공중전을 날먹한다거나

개인적으로

적폐 1위 하쿠멘 + 카운터로 모든 보스전 날먹 가능하고

범용 플레이는 Es가 제일 무난한 것 같음


노데미지, 킬카운트, 스피드런 같은거에 비례하는 버프가 많은데 1대 맞으면 킬 카운터 날라감..


3? 4스? 벛꽃 스테이지에서 텔포하다 버그걸리면 가끔 무한 낙사하는데 재접해도 안사라짐..

멀티플레이어는 핑이 너무 높은건지 조작감이 너무 구리고 뭐하는 건지 설명도 너무 부실함
PVP 요소가 그렇듯이 슈아로 떡칠하거나 카운터 챔을 해야지 정신 이롭게 겜이 가능함
그리고 상호작용키가 다른키랑 겹치면 (예) 공격이 우선으로 나가서 상호작용을 못함 _ _)

블블 캐릭이지만 중국 제작사고 좀 긴가민가 했는데

생각보다 재밌고 2만원의 값어치는 충분히 하는 것 같음",1707554808,1707554808,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In short, it's still a great roguelike, and the 1.0 update has not only fixed the issues I initially had, but also overhauled how the game works in great ways.

Entropy Effect is a roguelike with a heavy focus on platform-fighter style combo-heavy combat. Upgrades are geared toward giving you new moves and passive abilities that increase your combo and damage potential. It's a fun way of turning a fighting game IP into an action platformer with roguelike elements.

During early access, progressing in runs would reward you with AP points, which you then spend on a selection of upgrades that increase your overall versatility for future runs. 1.0 maintains a similar structure, but now, instead of purchasing flat upgrades, you spend those points to level up your overall level, which increases your health, gives you special benefits, and unlocks slots for a new ""Implant"" system. Every time you defeat a boss during a run, you gain a crystal, and when you gain five of these, you can combine them to unlock a perk of your choice. There's a healthy variety of these perks, ranging from revives that allow you to avoid death, increased damage and resistance, and more. You can equip up to 6 of these perks once you level your character up high enough. These perks can also be ascended up to two times to further increase their effectiveness. While this system does decrease your overall effectiveness compared to EA, since you no longer have all of these upgrades applied at once like you did before, it offers far more customization to how you choose to approach your playstyle, and offers an incentive to continue grinding runs for AP so that you can further upgrade your implants.

1.0 also offers a more robust difficulty system. During EA, you only had access to two preset difficulties, with nothing else allowing for a greater challenge apart from intentionally allowing your Entropy level to rise and give you debuffs. 1.0 takes a page from Hades' difficulty by allowing you to customize the challenge at your leisure - as you complete runs and collect boss crystals, you'll be able to increase a variety of different modifiers, such as enemy/boss damage and health, adding a time limit to encourage fast playthroughs, changing the behavior of bosses, among many others, all with the benefit of earning higher rewards. I'm still fairly early into the game, so I have yet to see the full potential of this system, but it is already a massive improvement from the previous difficulty system, as it allows me to fully control the challenge and let me play at my own pace.

HP Mixtures were greatly improved since EA. My initial complaint was that the input to activate a mixture was so easy to press by complete accident, and the animation for said mixture could not be interrupted, so it was easy to accidentally waste them. They did nullify this problem by later allowing you to interrupt the animation, but it was still an annoyance with the button input. Now in 1.0, while you can no longer cancel the mixture (at least to my knowledge), activating it is done with a combination input, meaning that it's impossible to do so by accident anymore. A far better change imho.

Bosses are also improved. The bosses overall haven't changed from EA, but 1.0 does introduce a brand new boss for world 4, so now all of the worlds have two boss variations each, and the existing bosses have been improved, including certain bosses that I initially had issue with due to a lack of proper cues for attacks.

Character selection is still great, including the brand new characters introduced since the start of EA. They all feel great to play (Taokaka probably being my favorite because of how fast she is). That said, I really hope that more characters are added - the devs have said that they intend to update the game further, and I hope that includes the roster, because there is still a lot of potential on that front.

Overall, I'm very glad I gave this game a chance despite not being into BlazBlue - and thankfully you don't really need to understand the lore of that IP to jump into this game, as you only get that representation in the character roster and not the overall story.

When I first bought it, I tried it out and refunded it because it didn't quite grab me in the way I wanted it too. I wanted explosive fighting that kept me engaged, I wanted to try out a bunch of characters until I found one that fit my play style and master them, but what I got at first was a slower game where I ran through levels constantly feeling like I was losing until i'd get one particular potential and get out of control. Every time I saw this game on sale though, I yearned to play it again, so after I saw it on sale at the end of Jan I gave in and tried it. The combat and game play felt smooth, it finally clicked for me properly, the music slapped in those clutch fights, and there was a somewhat engaging story through the Phenomena you could find by completing runs. Overall I have a few main points: 1. The runs felt too easy for me most of the way through, even with added Entropy effects. 2. The story felt lacklustre to me and I found myself often getting bored of the slow (often deliberately dismissive) dialogue and skipping bits of it by the end. 3.

Characters expand their abilities with upgrades offered for repeating randomly generated levels with randomly chosen upgrade rewards that reset at the end of a run.

Metroidvania games only offer permanent upgrades as far as I can tell, and reward exploration and uses expanded abilities to further exploration.  This game has no real exploration to speak of, and randomly uncovering events that progress the story without any obvious choices to be made does feel very BlazBlue from my very limited experience with the setting.

I never played the Early Access version, so I don't really know how it used to be, but it seemed to me that lots of things feel off about this game (at least now).

I wanted to update this review, though, because issues with the gameplay feeling aren't really the core problem with this game. It's true that some characters are far less fluid feeling than others (don't accidentally choose the wrong unlock to start with). I also have some issues with the dodging and jumping. But the real problem with this game is that this is one of those overly distilled type of experiences. It's like a representation of game, or a rough draft of a game, rather than a fully fleshed-out experience.

What I mean by that is that combat against simple AI in tiny square environments is all there is. There is no exploration to speak of. Except for the very last environment (where they made a halfhearted attempt at level design), there's nothing but square room after square room to just fight in. You get your rewards (health, powerups, etc) in what is essentially a menu between the rooms. Fight 10-15 trivial minion guys in a box, get a reward. Fight 10-15 more minion guys in a box, get another reward. After every 5 or so boxes you get through, you get to fight a fairly straight-forward boss so you can advance to the next environment, which itself feels substantially similar to all the rest.

And this makes sense in-game because you're not really the character who's fighting in any real place. The character you're really controlling is an adorable little robot living in Robot Town who's been tasked with playing a fighting simulator over and over again (for reasons that nobody ever sufficiently explains). Those flashy, highly animated BlazBlue characters aren't who you are. You're a little robot who's playing a BlazBlue videogame.

So, of course you don't do anything but fight. You're in a simple combat simulator. Of course you never happen upon a new character in the world or see an interesting event while you're walking around as your fighter. You're not really in a place. Of course your rewards come prescribed to you between fighting rooms. It's a game. Of course, of course, of course. The simulator game that your little robot is playing is just a simple, one-dimensional fighting experience designed to train his little robot mind.

Unfortunately, the simple, one-dimensional simulator game that your little robot is playing is also the game that you're playing and is the only part of the Entropy Effect that we as players are really meant to enjoy. Walking around as the cute little robot in the ""real"" over-world isn't at all fun and is featured in zero of the marketing for this title for good reason.

If all you want to do is feel ultra-powerful by dominating a few handfuls of simple guys with an overwhelming array of moves compared to what the enemy can do, then I guess this might be okay for you. There's a fair amount to like about this game in terms of polish, animation, character art, character design, and yes... even the fluidity of the mechanics (most of the time). But for me, I'd really like there to be far more game to the games that I play. I feel like Entropy Effect is a video-game outline made real, with nothing but the bare necessities. What it has is alright, but it just doesn't have a lot.",1707216633,1707373676,False,3,1,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,False

Turns out mixing fighting game mechanics and crazy roguelite builds leads to THE most fun combat I have ever experienced from this genre. Every character has their own ways to break the game, but they all require skill and practice to master. It looks great too, and even runs well on my lousy laptop. Combat is definitely the best part of the game.

The roguelite elements are shamelessly swiped from Hades, and I'm alright with that. You have upgrades you can get with the rewards from your runs, and multiple difficulty modifiers to make the game harder, but increase the rewards. It does its job.

People dislike the story here because it doesn't have anything to do with Blazblue (on the surface), but after thinking about it, I think it's alright on its own terms. The choices you make during the story actually do matter, along with how many Phenomenon (secrets) you find. Annoyingly, when you complete the story, the ending is locked in on that save file, and you have to start a new game if you want a different one. For me personally, finding different endings isn't enough to justify starting the whole game over. Story is probably the weakest part of the game. (although my ending had a pretty awesome final boss/twist).

Gameplay
Pretty fun Rogue-like with some unique quirks, built off the skeleton of a fighting series the character movesets feel very strong, and the procedural mechanics are a mix of Dead Cells and Hades

Graphics
While the Blazblue sprites still look good enough it leaves me wanting the 3D models those are based off of, art direction is a solid Japanese neon sci-fi style, and the particles look good, if sometimes a bit too flashy to the point of hiding information

Sound
Sadly the characters you're playing as don't have an english dub, soundtrack is fine and sound effects range from somewhat annoying to really good, voice lines still hit as hard as they usually do on SP skills, English voice cast does their jobs pretty well.

Performance
My graphics card is a NVidia 1060, and I'm running an 11th gen i5, and even with these outdated specs, outside of a few specific rooms that don't even have combat, I almost never see framerate dips. No crashes yet either, so pretty good on that front.

Lore
So far I've seen pretty much nothing Blazblue related in the actual meat of this game's lore, however the achievements imply that the devs do know at least some of the story of Blazblue, so I could be wrong about it being disconnected, but 8 hours in and there's no mention of what's going on with the Susano'o unit or anything like that.

Now, is the game better than dead cells?

In terms of gameplay and ""skill"" expresion? ABSOLUTELY, as the game is build as a ""fighting"" game on its core, making it probably one of the cleanest games in terms of movement and player control that I have ever played.

Now, in terms of content? Not really. Although the gameplay is extremely fun, the visuals are excellent, and the overall feel of the game is brilliant. It lacks in the content department, as instead of having ""lots"" of content, it goes the Hades route of having the same 4 areas + final area, with 2 bosses for each of the areas, which then can be made harder with modifiers.

The introduction of fighting combos as upgrades makes the ramping of power on a run feel exciting and rewarding. The games inherit difficulty provides a survival of the fittest environment which allows the technical and unique combat system to flourish.

I never played the early access after hearing some problems about it, but after deciding to just buy the full release I found it crazy fun. Each character is ported over faithfully from BlazBlue Centralfiction, keeping most of their moves and having new upgrades or variations to them that you can get each run. The artstyle and animation is a beautiful mix of pixel and drawn, using lighting and bloom to make elements really pop in the environment. Gameplay is fun and fluid, and difficulty usually feels like its close to a good level, sometimes being a bit too hard or too easy. Bosses are fun and have interesting movesets, but sometimes feel a bit bland in presentation (generic fat zombie, robot, desert snake). One thing I REALLY appreciate about ""entropy"", the system used to make runs harder, is that every modifier is selectable rather than forced on to you. So instead of the devs adding artificial difficulty by making enemies damage sponges at higher levels, you can just raise other modifiers like traps doing more damage, less choices in shops etc.

in the future, I hope we see:
more characters (I would love to see Bullet and Tager as they are my mains in BlazBlue, and Arakune and Susanoo could be unlocked after beating them), more synergy between different tactic elements (e.g, fire and ice doing frostburn damage, lightning and toxin doing nuclear?) and more environments and bosses. :)",1707277630,1707277630,True,1,0,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

The technique

Very satifiying, though the artistic might not be for everyone (if i'm being picky). OSt is great and other sound are pretty much directly from BB franchise.
The game itself isn't very demanding in ressources so it might even run on a potatoe PC.


The good

honestly, this is a good rogue game. You progress, you have your initial load of capacities per characters, some improvement are directly linked to the characters, some are generic. 
Of course, you have a progress system that allow you to have permanent buff that you buy with some point you collect as you progress.
Little addition, when you finish a game (win or lose), you can select two abilities that will stick to an archetype recorded. When you begin a new run, you can select this archetype gaining the 2 abilities you retain + one active and one passive from the character itself.

The fact that it's Blazblue franchise and characters that you play is just cherry on top and it's a blast to use your favourite character IG.


The bad

As for every games with multiple characters, balance is a thing.
Overall it's not too bad with 1-2 characters clearly ahead of the others and so far 1 that I genuinly think he is off-balance, but I still 2 characters to play with.
The most of them though, are feeling good to play with and got no uber-advantage or things that draw them back.


In conclusion, it's a solid game that worth it's price if you like the genre or BB franchise or you might wait for a bit of a price drop if you don't. But still very enoyable.",1707229900,1707229900,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a rogue like platformer fighting game ish(?), as of writing this there is 5 stages and 10 characters. There's also tactics (elements) for your attack, dodge, skill etc. and ofc with combine tactics as well. Each characters have different move set however you can get Potentials levels where you unlock more move sets for them. Which unlock more attack, dash, jump, skills combo that you can hit your enemy with. All characters have different play style for sure, same could be said for the Potential that you selected for them. As for end game, similar to Hades difficult setting that you can turn on which one in particular gives bosses new move set and well make the game harder ofc. Perks that you can unlocked that help your runs, or one of the cool system that you can merge your old run to help your new run as well, however there is a difficulty setting that disable that completely if you so desire.  To enable higher difficult I dont know if you have to beat the game or not since I couldnt find it for a while. It is a platform right before you get boosted to the selected characters, right bellow the small panel. Contents wise you probably can get this game done within 20 hours if you're are familiar with this style of game. As for the PVPVE mode I played a few, it seem like an extraction PVPVE, currently the server are too laggy for it be any decent or at least in my experience.

However, the progression of this game lacks that ""one more run"" sensation that makes for a successful roguelike. It's stuck between being an action game and a roguelike, but without the tight level design and enemy encounters that make action games enjoyable, and without the crazy randomness and sense of intrigue that can be found in the best rougelikes.

There's no sense of exploration in any of the stages apart from the final stage, which resembles a typical Dead Cells level in its presentation. The remainder of a run will consist of clearing out corridors filled with enemies, and after killing them all (or surviving for several seconds) you'll grab an upgrade and move on. After two runs I grew tired of the formula. The stage progression is so narcoleptic that I couldn't bear to play any longer.

What kills me is that the developers were so close to making a great game, because the final stage gives you the freedom to explore and carve your way through a decent map, with upgrades and optional bosses tucked in the corners.

With that comparison, it has the same positives and negatives that comes with Hades. The great thing about it is the combat, gameplay and build diversity. The combat feels smooth, and choosing tactics and potentials can change your playstyle for every character, giving you reasons to play the same character again. 

However, they copied the story mechanics and difficulty from Hades, which I really dislike. The difficulty system is the same as the pact of punishment, where you choose modifiers to make your run more difficult, and earn additional rewards for each point of difficulty. I believe this was the worst part of Hades and the worst part of this game too. It is a lazy way to artificially make the game harder and just makes the player grind easier difficulties to get all the rewards, making runs boring since you are not incentivized to challenge yourself at your highest difficulty. Second, the story is gated behind certain objectives which are laughably easy, making it possible to finish the story in as little as 10 runs. But the ending you get is more decided by how many runs you complete. This makes it possible to finish the story before you are ready, resulting in a bad end before you even know what is going on.

Likewise the skill trees look intimidating, but they're really just letting you see the full range of possibilities for your build including the Hades style 'duo boons' in-game, without needing an external wiki to plan on the fly.

[strike] I think the complaint about this game's use of the Blazblue characters is valid for people who are attached to the series, and if you're one of those people, I don't think anything anyone is going to say will change your mind.

For everyone else, however, there's some really solid stuff here. The long and short of it is that this is a roguelite action-platformer that focuses on fast and fluid combat, encourages experimentation, and leaves plenty of room for player expression with its Potential system and diverse roster of characters. Nothing I've played feels quite like it.

There's already a good amount of content here for $20, with more on the way as the game proceeds through Early Access, and since its release earlier this month there have already been multiple patches to fix bugs, add features, and address some complaints.

If this game piques your interest, I think it's very much worth your time and your money, even in its current state. If this keeps up, I can see it having a very bright future, and I'm going to be eagerly anticipating each new content update. [/strike]


[h1] POST-LAUNCH EDIT: [/h1]


The fact that this game has dropped to Mostly Positive at the time of writing has me wondering if people actually played the Early Access version at all. This is far from the first time systems have been revamped between then and now, though it's definitely the most extensive amount of changes in one patch, and I don't think it's nearly as bad as people are making it out to be.

I put 78 hours into the EA version and another 20 in the release version and I still believe that this game is as good as it was before 1.0. It's just that a lot has changed, EA players need to relearn the systems, and the devs need time to tweak some numbers here and there in what is effectively a brand new cycle, which they've done before in previous cycles after a major patch, and already *have* done for this one via multiple hotfixes in the couple days after release.

The core gameplay is still incredible and in most ways has been made even better. The higher amount of Potentials per run does make it harder to get the ones you want, but it also made some characters much more fun to play and allows you to build more of a ""moveset"" for your character than before. The changes to inputs (i.e the input for Inferno Divider being Up+Attack instead of Attack->Jump) and the lower reluctance to take Triple Jump/Dash also contribute to this and make combat flow a lot better.

Difficulty is less one-note (Easy->Normal->Hard) and more a ""choose your own"" style that you see in games like Hades, where you apply negative modifiers to yourself per run. That said, the game can be pretty brutal at a baseline before you unlock and level your permanent upgrades. This was significantly harder on release, but the aforementioned hotfixes have made this process much easier, not only by adding a bunch more buffs to slot in, but also making AP easier to gain, letting you buy specific Mind Crystals instead of rolling for a random one, and decreasing their materials' cost in the AP shop.

This lets you get over the hurdle of being given no ""second chance"" and only one HP Mixture at the start of a run, whereas in EA with full upgrades you would have 1 and 5 respectively. One can use their resources to slot in defensive abilities and stay alive longer or allow more mistakes, or go full glass cannon and make your character deal more damage. The new system introduces some planning into your run before it even starts, rather than the permanent upgrades from EA which only served to make the game easier across the board as you progressed.

This is also the hardest incarnation of the final boss yet, but I think it's the one that best matches the character and properly serves as the test at the end of a run. The additions to the advanced version of it are also awesome and very welcome, as even on Hard mode in EA it rarely posed a challenge towards the end of my playtime. I'm still dying to it on a regular basis.",1693270039,1707100519,True,22,0,0.722829520702362061,0,True,False,True

The game is still quite fun and for the price enough content-wise. Combos are satisfying and the loop is still fun but feels more simplified than early access. In terms of the good, it seems devs listened and fixed the perk system somewhat, and they gave Early Access players their currency back to quickly unlock things (although I did not mind the reset myself). I decided to put in the hours to see if 1.0 changed anything and the gradual changes the devs are making post release have been positive. It just feels easier now even with specific heat variables on, maybe some numbers got overtuned and will be patched to give more difficulty. However, i think for the price you get a unique and addicting anime 2d roguelike, just be prepared to beat it fast once you get a hang of the powers and controls. 

I will switch to recommending this game now that the perk system is not gacha. I lament the loss of the original entropy effect difficulty system though. However, I believe older builds are available and the old save files are still there. To address what I mean, previously the game used to have 3 distinct difficulties and a mechanic of entropy which was a percent value that grew as you explored and would give temporary buffs and debuffs throughout the run based on the percentage. It was unique in terms of balancing out the risk/reward of a run, and was generally more tough experience/progression. now it is replaced with a heat system similar to hades where you tune the difficulty for more rewards (used to unlock perks). This does add replayability but I found the new difficulties even with heat to be a bit too easy. I pass almost every run now but used to have more runs end on the old hard mode. For some, this is a good thing, but again this is a personal issue. I still think you will get your money's worth from this game and theres a lot of characters to try and different combo builds to try that it is really good to boot up just to see enemies explode and to fight the bosses.",1703790160,1707084505,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is a roguelite 2D sides scrolling battle game. You are mostly going to be going into the ""mind training sessions"" and playing the characters of your choice. ALL of the characters are unique in how they play, some are much more aggressive then others and some more passive. There is a learning curve and the more you play the better you will get. You can say that for just about any game, but it really does exist here and it is a game that's very fair in how this is done which is saying a lot, because many games simply aren't balanced, this one is (that even includes being able to actually react to what the bosses/enemies are doing).

As for what you'll be collecting (what makes it a roguelite) you'll be going from room to room clearing out enemies, getting your reward if there is one and selecting your option, then getting different options to pick from at the end of the room for your next choice. It's simple, straightfoward, and it tells you what you're selecting (unless you choose the modifier that hides it lol). The modifiers are either going to be boosting your combos/specials or adding extra effects to your characters and sometimes even new attacks. I can definitely say when the game started to become too easy I started turning on said modifiers and it made it A LOT more fun.

Also, don't worry about struggling at first, you're gonna struggle but it's a learning process. Once you get it, the game will get A LOT easier as you progress. Also choose your difficulty options wisely as you don't want a strict time limit with the enemies having 90% more health that also applies to the bosses btw 😂 Overall the game is a blast and most of the characters are fun to play.

Never played any of the series so far and that's not a problem to following the story.  The game loop is really fun, controls are tight, it all looks great.  I'm playing on hard and it's not really a problem.  I'm getting some jitters in places, but not during combat so that's fine.  The legacy system is awesome (absorbing powers from previous runs with different characters).

Back to the story...so there's loads to do outside of the main game loop, the narrative is really well done, solid voice acting, had a few animated conversations with my other half about what I *think* is going on...  Some of the best roguelike/roguelites I've played have stuff to keep you busy between runs should you wish (like the sushi restaurant and gambling in the fishpeople village that Dave the Diver had), this game totally has that in the form of meaningful interactions with people (well...robots) in the main base area.

The fast paced action split into clear short stages mixed in with (in game not monetary) gambling mechanics is pretty fun in a Warioware/ Shutshimi way.  Going to make it very clear there is no monetisation in this game outside of DLCs. You pay and you get a game.  Exactly how it should be!

Now with 1.0 out I can say that this is the best rogue lite out there, even if there's hate, or controversy behind this game, you can enjoy it for what it's worth. Yes it is falsely using the Blazblue name because they have the rights for it, yes it has nothing to do with it. But does that matter in the grand scheme of things? not to me at least. I get to play my favourite characters like Ki Kiske from Blazblue. But in all seriousness the one complaint I have with this release is the upgrade system that's across everyone, it was way better in EA, but besides that. I don't really mind anything else, the combat was drastically improved, the core gameplay got better, there's neat eastereggs if you complete the challenge with 100 entropy, and neat stuff like that.

I Played EA and unlike what many people are saying about the 1.0 release I feel that the game has only improved.

For those who don't like 1.0 Your data wasn't lost revert to the EA beta by right clicking game in steam, properties>Betas>Beta participation>early access

-story aspects are rather interesting as I have come to expect from BlazBlue Games.
 
-I play mostly on the steam deck I have not noticed any of the so called 1.0 clunky controls. 1.0 did change some of the key controls used for attacks / combos.  Because of muscle memory this is kinda a pain at first for old players however the new setup does give you better control of your character.

-Mind system, Pick 6 buffs from a list you've unlocked adding to build diversity, personally I think atk, def, and utility, mind crystals buffs should have had their own equip slots to force diversity, as they are now many will never/rarely be used in favor of DMG-up ones.

- 10 total characters which play and feel drastically different. 

- multiple unlockable moves/attacks/character buffs during a run, each with sub upgrades (some have hidden upgrades too!)

- there are 6 different elements which can be used to augments basic attacks, skill/moves, movement, add summons, or add effects to legacy skills.

- These augments can also be combined  with each other by climbing the associate skill tree (there are ~3 skill trees per element)

- Legacy systems -  after a run is over, that character is saved to your Legacy, alongside up to two of the aforementioned tactics/augments of your choosing. That last part is important because you slot two Legacy characters into your character at the start a run. This allows you to utilize the saved augments without climbing the associated tree\ and utilize each characters' unique Legacy Skill (basically an extra attack move on cooldown).

-Legacy characters can also be used (one time only) in a boss ladder mode. I won't get into it but I thought it was a very cool idea.

Até ai temos um rouguelike competente, POREM, existe um sistema onde toda vez que voce termina uma run(Ganhando ou Não) o personagem fica ""Salvo"", onde voce pode usar ele em outros modos(Challenges e Extration online) e AINDA MAIS, quando se vai começar uma nova run, voce pode escolher 2 desses personagens para serem ""implementados"" na sua nova run, onde voce ganha uma habilidade e passiva fixa de cada um deles E 2 habilidades elementais que voce escolheu salvar na ultima run(Dependendo do quão longe voce foi, o numero pode ser menor dessa habilidades elementais), permitindo fazer combos logo de começo e ficar ainda mais forte.

There are quite few characters to play and if you are familiar with blazblue universe you will know who they are. I was a fun of this universe from the anime back in the day, also its my first time playing a blazblue game and so far im having a blast.
So far the game for me is worth the money spent and im hoping the devs to create more content or possibly add more characters or lore to it.

I played for 5h straight instead of going to sleep. If DMC were a 2D side-scroller and had a baby with Have A Nice Death / Dead Cells it would have been this game.
I saw the game back before EA launched and didn't buy it afterward because reasons, idk how different 1.0 is compare to pre-launch but I'm having so much fun with this amazing combat system, fully voice acted, both ENG and JAP sounds great, the art style is beautiful, animations are so smooth, the game doesn't feel cheap, it doesn't even feel like an Indie game.
I'm not sure how much contents there are but in order to mastered all characters should take awhile, totally worth it.

Editt: I finished the story, didn't think there would be an ending so early, the last fight was awesome and there are multiple endings ? You can make a new save file and still keep all the progresses.

Edittt: 
The game borrows a lot of systems from other roguelites:
.Boons (room rewards) and Keepsafes (mind crystals) systems from Hades, some even have the same effect like increase spawn chance of certain types of room.
But they did not just borrowed the system, they improved it. After each run the game will let you pick 2 random upgrades that you chose and save it to aid you in future runs. When picking character you can choose 2 more characters from your previous runs and gain their Skill, Passive, 2 Upgrades that you picked before. This system is simply amazing as it let you carry over some small upgrades to future runs, reducing the RNG needed for selecting the right upgrades that you want and create some synergizes between characters
.Heat system (Entropy) from Hades, again some has the exact same effect like upgrade stage bosses moveset
.Little story progress after each run like Hades but on a way way smaller scale
.Choosing next rooms UI from Have A Nice Death
This isn't a bad thing as they are well implemented, Have A Nice Death could have been better if it copied BBEE combat, both games are fairly similar but HAND combat isn't good enough to overshadow its flaws.

Gameplay is similar to Have A Nice Death, there are 4 stages, 3 out of 4 stages each will have 8 rooms, you kill all the enemies in a room to progress. The last stage is like Dead Cells, one slightly bigger random generated room with 2 upgrades, 2 Elites and the final boss. Normal enemies pose no threat at all, you should be able to kill them before they can even breath, bosses don't have a lot of attacks but with Entropy they are pretty crazy, almost like bullet-hell. The only thing I don't like is that they have so many delay attacks like Morgot in Elden Ring, there are some flashing warning but they are usually too early instead of flashing just before the enemy about to attack like in Dead Cells.

I can't stress enough how good and flashy the combat is, the last time I had this much fun was doing All S Vergil in DMC5, this game is like a roguelike DMC, you start with only basic attacks and keep unlocking more moves through out stages, by the time you reached the final boss you should have a good amount of attacks to do some crazy combos. Not only you will unlocking more moves, you will also adding elemental effects to every of your abilities (i.e Cold Attack, Lighting Dash, etc.) like the god boons from Hades. You can stun bosses after doing enough damage or the boss HP reach a certain % I'm not sure, but you can stun them just like in DMC5. In fact the game even has a character that is blue, use katana, require precise timing to enhance his attacks, has his own version of Judgement Cut and Judgement Cut End. 9/10 best action-roguelite ever.",1706831477,1706918253,True,4,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

I didn't like all the changes at first, namely losing my save data, but I appreciate the devs for trying to make it up to EA players and clearly being very receptive to feedback. At least making the EA version still playable as a beta with the old save data and the compensation they have provided and will be providing does make up for the loss of progress (I only had played 4-5 hours so I didn't lose a ton). If you didn't get this in EA this is all moot and irrelevant, and it doesn't change my recommendation, but other devs should take note of this as it's great customer service and really listening to your buyers and players.

I got this at the end of Early Access updates so I probably won't edit this when the full version comes...this is a BlazBlue game but instead of being a fighting game it's a weird mix of platformer and interactive story. You're a robit trying to figure out some weird plot in a mind training system and you do ""training"" which are side-scrolling action stages using a handful of popular BlazBlue characters (there were 10 available when I started playing but will be at least 11 in the full version)..
Since the characters are smaller than normal there isn't as much detail graphically but they still look good and the action is very fluid with nice backgrounds. The sounds are kinda mixed because the only voice options are limited English but otherwise only Chinese, but they promise English & Japanese will be available in the full version. You need a good controller to play this because you'll use practically every button for moving and attacking, but on-screen guides (although small) are helpful. The gameplay is a branching series of side-scrolling stages at first, sometimes with shops & lottery-style events mixed in, plus an occasional boss battle, then if you survive long enough it's on to the much-longer and bigger final stage, beat that and you ""win"", then back to repetitive dialogue and interacting with different things. It does save your progress and unlocks and you can select some records before beginning a run, and the randomization of stages offer plenty of replay value. I'm not a big fan of the characters available just because some of my favorites are currently missing (no Tager is big for me, and also no ""Boobie Lady"" Litchi. At least Taokaka is coming in full release)
It's different from other BlazBlue games but in a good way. If you like action/platformer games and one or more of your favorite characters is here, give it a try.

It makes the game significantly harder than the normal playthrough, but in the bad way. I understand that the dev use Hades difficultty scalers as the base, and some of the modifiers are very good, such as remove inherited tactics or increase shop items price, but overall the difficulty scale is too high, the punishment is too harsh and the reward for increase entropy point can not make up to the insane RNG of the game is on high entropy points, especially when you get max entropy on remove tactic options or remove potential options.

To me, prevent player from getting stuff during the run is not a good way to actually make the game harder, because player with good skill but bad RNG will easily give up the run on high entropy point when they face the first boss because of the lack of damage they are. Instead the dev should think about the entropy system like dead cell: provide player a good amouts of initial items so that even player with bad skill can almost reach omega space most of the time. Then if you increase the entropy point, you remove some of the initial items until the point that the dev it is hard enough. 

Also to make up the difficulty, black market should be available from the beginning; entropy system should add some kinds of challenge-reward-punishment entropy modifier, and adjust the time limits modifier slightly to make it more enjoyable such as make the time limit scales with the entropy points so that the more entropy point you have, the longer time limit is.

[b]Version 1.0 Release[/b] 

With the game being out of early access the new content or the number of changes in design are immense. This much change on the game design from ground to top is actually a very risky action, and it's surprising that developers made these changes right after EA. As a result, the situation puts the game in a strange position. I would like to love each aspect of the version 1.0 but there are some ideas that definitely didn't work for me. The rule breaking builds are lesser common for the game after the changes. One of the main reasons for this the meta upgrades are out of the picture and they decided to put these upgrades behind difficulty points. Each time you increase attack of enemies, increase their health, etc. the game gives you some buffs. Most of these buffs were buyable with in-game currency during EA as meta game upgrades. This design change doesn't make any sense. First and most importantly, the reason people get upgrades for the runs is to make the game easier for them. As a result, this kind of design choice definitely conflicts in every way within its purpose. It would be much wiser to have these upgrades as a buyable option to make the runs easier. Also, that way the difficulty changes might be a way to upgrade the currency gathering rates for players. On the other hand, they give us some kind of a rune upgrades for the game. The design of this basically is you have five slots which one is open at the beginning. You can get a level up for these slots at levels  such as 25 and 35, etc. Furthermore you can get levels for the runes up to three times as well. This design seems alright at first glance. But you realise the immense grind it needs is a bit much to be honest. First of all, each level up increases the cost by 25 and it becomes astronomical later levels. Also in between levels that you can get new slot only gives small amount of health to the player. As a result the process feels tedious. Another new feature the game has which may not be an issue for some is the intense inclusion of missions in game. In my EA review I did mention I didn't give any attention to the story and it didn't take anything from me. This new inclusion feels like it gives more limitations to the players. Yet the opening of the game also provides a better understanding for the gameplay and world design, and you start to collect new characters much faster with mission-based structure. Another mention worthy inclusion is the multiplayer mode, but I don't have any intention of testing this mode, until they add local multiplayer. I just glanced this area and saw there a currency type, which I don't know if it's an in-game currency or purchasable.

The overall gameplay seems improved. There are some visual improvements on the game. The in-game character upgrade system is much simpler and better than EA. Also new character Taokaka is pretty fun to play. There also some UI design changes as well. I actually liked most of these changes and find most of them more user friendly. One issue I had with them is Potential Upgrade selection menu is being shown diagonally. It made the scene more complex than early version because there is only three options available and the way it’s presented is confusing. Even tough, categorising the upgrades was pretty neat to see. In the end the game still has its core and awesome gameplay, and lets the players have a good time. I also believe the developers will make future developments to the title to improve the game in each section.

[b]Early Access[/b] 

Blazblue: Entropy Effect is side-scrolling rogue-lite game with little platforming elements. It uses characters from the Blazblue series. Which are known by some but most importantly, they have visually appealing, distinct anime style. But the game doesn’t only depend on the characters that are bellowed by its core niche players of the fighting series. It provides very diverse gameplay styles with these characters, and combines it with spectacularly smooth gameplay. The game has a starting area which a meta story involves around. The story didn’t able to catch my attention that much, because I didn’t expect it to have any and skipped most of the dialogue. So, I don’t have much to say about. 

The game has stages to clear. Each room are randomly encountered. Some of these rooms have enemies to defeat, some traps and platforming elements in them. You can also encounter some random events, on some rooms like exchange room to get some upgrades or heal yourself. This mechanic is reminiscent of Hades level design in a way.

The game starts blunt during its first few rounds. But later you start to learn the enemies’ movements, and start to master your character and their possibilities. That process makes the game more of a joyful ride. Characters have their movement and animations from the fighting games they belong. Each character has their own move-set with weaknesses and advantages they bring. For example, one character is slow on attacks the dodge doesn’t pass through other characters, but his damage is very high, the dodge damages the enemy, and have parry skill that can block almost all of the attacks. Another one has a bit more range, but much less damage output, yet can recover some of its health after taking damage and much more mobile than most of the characters. Another cool gimmick is you can upgrade or change the move-set of each character during runs with potentials, you will encounter in the game. Potentials can be gotten via defeating bosses or in random encountered rooms. Most of these potentials are exclusive to their respected character. That makes me want to praise the effort, creators put into the game. On top of these there also mods that are called Tactics. Tactics provides your attack, skills and dodge another damage or defence potential. Tactics has some similarities with God Boons in Hades. Another mechanic that I need to talk is each run you get a score with a character you played, and you can choose this character as a legacy character to provide you some unique passives and skills.

There are few other things that I want to mention before finishing the review. On the last stage you get into a map which has output that is similar to Dead Cells. The map has teleportation points to shorten the paths you discovered and rooms that opens to bosses you haven’t encountered during your run, includes the final boss of the game. This map gave me nostalgia about Dead Cells and I appreciated this little homage for one of the games they inspired. Another thing is the playable characters aren’t only characters that are taken from the series. Some of them (2 for the time) are used as boss as well. This idea gave me mixed feelings. One the characters they used for to be boss were canonically bad or natural characters, so it made sense to use them as a boss stage. Yet it removed the possibility to play as them and discover, develop strategies with these characters.

As in the Early Access state there are 10 playable characters, yet each have pretty solid number of potentials to vary their gameplay on their own. You can see how many possible ways you can play out each run with the given mechanics. In addition, I believe there’s so much room for it to develop, and increase its already blooming variety. Finally, I can easily recommend the game pure on the enjoyment it provided in its core gameplay mechanics even though it’s slow start and not so interesting story.",1704634753,1706889025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not just for the content and gameplay available currently, but for what could possibly come in the future. It's not the hardest, nor does it need to be. It's an adequate amount of challenge, skill, strategy, and reflex testing all in one rogue-like style platformer. I love it.

Gameplay is solid- Attack, skill, legacy skills, and dodge. simple mechanics per character you use and makes for excellent possibilities throughout the game.

Environment designs are nice- vivid color palettes give you a nice ambient and clear feeling of your surroundings, along with the enemies that spawn in on each tileset.

Bosses are fun- having faced each boss a dozen times or so with each character, i can say there's a good chance the next ones will be just as fun (after adjustments and patches), though i didn't care too much about the most recent patch (just put it in hard mode and i'll be alright) but it's no big deal.

plot- so apparently this exists, but you don't have to care if you don't want. I like that, gameplay first and story second. This is my subjective take.

Hopes for the future- I wanna see at least six or seven more characters from the BlazBlue universe (Bullet, Makoto, Litchi, Taokaka, etc) and even see them as potential bosses in game. 

a Randomizer mode to be unlocked upon completing normal mode, or maybe an arcade mode (more on this later)

expanding the tilesets by another three or four, and make the maps more random than in a consecutive order. 

Achievements that unlock other materials (artwork, music, skins (oh right))

The skin shop (which i assume is what that is), instead of the conventional method or using different colors, actual skins to unlock in game (whether by AP and/or by accomplishing certain tasks). Like Ragna shirtless or Noel as a clown (Random stuff, don't mind me lol)

Also, and i'm not sure how this would work, but maybe some characters from Guilty Gear being added to the roster, just for fun. I'd love to see Sol or Venom, but i'm not holding my breath there.


Anywho, 9/10, good game, grab it now. It's a good Rogue-like. Hope to see more like this.

I did however put in 19 hours of the EA and really liked how the game played put really hoped that some things were more streamlined. The game did a fresh reset but after 8hrs I am mostly back to where I was in the game from before as the entropy system no longer exists.

The main game play loop has drastically improved as it is much easier to pick and choose which tactics you want. Thank God they got rid off the entropy system because having a shit ton of debuffs when you're near stage omega on hard difficulty was a nightmare, getting tele-hunters was the worse shit. Now buffs and debuffs last practically forever but it is really easy to get rid of debuffs. Majority of the exchange and events have debuff removers and most of the debuffs are not that bad.

Game play is smoother than ever and they buffed Noel by giving her down + J as part of base kit, makes her aerial combat flow much better. All potentials from the characters I have played (Ragna, Jin, Noel, Mai, Es, Hakuman, Kokonoe and No.11) looks mostly from EA but possibly there is slight tweaks to all of their potentials. Since there is no patch notes I am not certain but I am sure that blood kain on Ragna was the most dumbest idea I have ever seen because the health drain on Ragna was so immense and you barely got any health gain from it. Now it's not really a problem picking up blood kain first potential doesn't straight kill you, good change. 

The difference from EA to 1.0 really are just the systems and the system changes are all for the better. The game play has not changed much and for people that miss the ""slow down time"" when you dodge a skill, pick up Jin or Es evo type as first or secondary. The two of them apply the ""slow down time"", but if you're a gamer you don't really need it just dodge and go back to combo gaming.

TLDR; Good game, as good as the EA, I hope the devs don't listen too much people about the game play because Noel actually does dmg and has the sauce pls don't nerf her.",1706885588,1706885588,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Besides that it's.. fine?
Beautiful presentation but the combat & gameplay loop isn't super compelling (the non-boss AI are just punching bags).
Feels like it's missing some kind of per-room performance rating system like Devil May Cry.

Content-wise though... it's severely lacking. I have beat the game on hard mode with almost every single character multiple times and seen pretty much all there is to see already, save for what little they'll be adding at launch.
There's a lot better roguelikes for this price or cheaper with significantly better replayability.
I was fully expecting a lot more to be added here since most of the assets are borrowed from Blazblue anyways, so it'd take them significantly less work to add to the game.
Unless the full release adds several new characters and stages, you won't get much more mileage out of it than me.

(EDIT): Now that the game has finally exited early access I can confidently say that everything in my review still stands true, if anything the game is even worse now.
Several systems like the meta progression, run variety and UI have been absolutely downgraded in the release update. All stuff that was working decently fine before, yet they chose the full release for all these massive changes that are now too late to revert given it's now out of early access.

[b]Pros[/b]: This game so far leaves a good impression on me. I've only played (and beat a run) as No.11 so far, but the combos are flashy. There's room to play around with combos as you unlock Potentials, which is basically equivalent to the character specific moveset you might see from BlazBlue itself. 

The game drops you in right away, and instead of a super long tutorial pausing the action, you get to play and feel things out yourself in a beginner stage. It's refreshing because outside of that, the game doesn't hold your hand and that's a good thing. 

The story seems intriguing so far. It's mysterious enough to want to know more, so I'm hoping for a compelling story.

[b]Cons[/b]: I mentioned combos before, and I'm kind on the fence if this is a true issue, or just comes with the territory. Basically, normal enemies and boss battles require to different strategies (expected), but it's a bit dissonant. For instance, most enemies have openings and flinch, so you can plan how to use your combo even with multiple enemies. Sometimes, enemies near the edge of the screen attack, and you need to keep your awareness so as not to get hit.

Now with bosses, especially character ones, you're almost forced to throw out all your combo conditioning in favor of survival. In games like these, I feel like enemies should ""train"" the player for the big mechanical boss fight, so you apply what you learned. Most of the boss fight though is spent doing the first 3rd of your moveset, then dodging as the boss does a huge AoE or screen-wide attack. Standing on the ground I noticed was the worst place to be, as a lot of attacks can be dodged just by being aerial. Winning comes down to chipping the boss rather than ""fighting"" directly in a sense, and the damage you actually do is highly reliant on your Tactics rather than your Potentials, because bosses don't flinch (until near the end of their health bar). This means some Potential features don't end up meaning much unless they're straight up additional damage increases. This is the biggest shame so far, but maybe that feeling will change as I play other characters.

[b]Hopes[/b]: I heard talk in the EA version that dodging at the right time produced a ""slow-mo"" effect that allowed you to attack a slowed down enemy, like Bayonetta's ""Witch-time"" for example. While there is a slow-mo effect for perfect dodges, it doesn't really give you anything from it other than looking cool in the current version. I'd love to see some kind of reward for pulling it off so that fighting bosses felt more strategic rather than slamming the dodge button half the time.

Alternatively, a pattern-opening system that requires you to dodge or block that leaves the opponent open to a full combo if done in time. That way, you can learn when you can attack and when you can't rather than just sneaking in attacks here and there without much intention.

Other than that, I'm hoping for an expanded roster at some point. I'd love to play my girl Makoto. Overall, would recommend if you like games with a challenge.",1706861383,1706861427,True,4,0,0.535398244857788086,0,True,False,False

The full release unfortunately seems to have just straight up made the game worse, although it's possible it's some kind of overarching bug. Characters control much worse, slower and less responsive. Even the loading is slower, the main menu is slower, just everything is slower in 1.0. They still have the previous EA build in the beta branch (which more devs should do) so it's easy for me to hop back and forth and test it out and it's just night and day.

It's also more grindy now, and they removed a ton of systems that were in the EA version like corruption + buffs, combos seem to be broken or gone, and the new ""coop"" thing isn't really what anyone thinks of when they think coop. Other QoL things were worsened:

*Maximum camera zoom distance is much closer now, which makes bosses more of a pain since they can often attack from off screen now. Also despite showing less the game just runs at worse fps as mentioned before

*The end of room upgrade choice thing is one step forward one step back. The old way was very easy to read, now it is harder and the way it scrolls is kind of strange too

*The selection for rooms to visit at the end of a room is very jumpy when using a controller now, and it's way too easy to accidentally select the wrong room unless you wait a full second after every direction input. It used to work fine.

*I have no idea if the balance is better or not, so much of the rest of the game has changed it's hard to compare. Despite making it farther in my first 1.0 run than any of my EA runs, the control felt way worse, so maybe it's just easier now flat out. It didn't really feel like I was in that much control, especially after getting used to the feeling of combat in EA

They did issue a patch in just a couple of days to give players the ability to import their meta resources from the EA file, but the option is not appearing for me. Presumably they'll fix that. All the other issues remains to be seen.

I know some people are enjoying the 1.0 which is fine, but I'd recommend checking out the EA beta branch and comparing, and try to convince me the 1.0 is not worse mechanically in every aspect. Even traversal in the hub is slower now.

The tutorial and translations seem somewhat improved but also some of the complex systems were removed so it could just be because it's a more straightforward roguelike thing now.",1706859530,1706859530,False,7,0,0.508555710315704346,0,True,False,False

I love how they literally remade UI and some systems almost from scratch several times during EA, and it's new UI again. That shows a lot of dedication, work and love put in this game.

I also really like the fact that you can now save 2 skills acquired during run in your evotypes instead of 1.

The 1.0 update completely altered every core aspect of the game. Between the end of December update and the end of January update a lot of the game's core systems were completely changed and a massive grind has been put in place

The first red flag is that EA saves were no longer valid. We'd have to sit on an EA version of the game to use them. The game changed so much in such a short space of time that I don't even believe we were playing an early version of the game. We were testing features that would be used in a completely different way.

Second is the massively increased grind for the in-game currency. Previously you could choose to unlock specific upgrades on a per-tier basis, now you pay to increase a level with slots unlocking at specific values. You get nothing in-between and you can no longer use the in-game currency to unlock said upgrades. It's the most basic grind setup you can create.

After the backlash and negative reviews from those who took part in Early Access, the devs created a method of bringing progress from EA into the game... But it's nowhere near the same value. All the currency we spent got refunded but all the unlocks and evotypes were lost. For example I was refunded a total of 22,000 currency. It's not enough for one of the skins and it doesn't make a dent in the level increasing. Furthermore, the level increases only unlock slots, not the abilities we lost from those slots. Now they need a different resource to be unlocked so even with the 22,000 refunded I cannot get back the stuff I spent hours unlocking. I've been scammed.

Lastly, Steam doesn't let you refund a game after 2 hours of play, so guess how many hours I've played because of early access? We can't even get a refund after being scammed. The devs of BlazBlu knew what they were doing with the save compatibility and creating a new resource for unlocking the buffs we lost.

I want to begin by congratulating the devs on their release. They have been extremely active on Twitter/X and have been following feedback closely, actively trying to improve the game: just a day after the 1.0 release of the game, they have already implemented a system to get some of your EA access progress into the 1.0+ game. Even during the EA period, the devs seemed committed to making this game the best they could, and I enjoy having bought the game during the EA period as that has allowed me to see the game's progress over time.
(I still remember the initial Entropy system which only gave Negative Corruption at an alarmingly fast rate, thankfully, they changed it.)

Not a Blazblue fan (I played a bit of Blazblue Cross Tag Battle but I didn't enjoy the game's handling of DLC and monetization), but I enjoy getting to play as somewhat familiar fighting game characters. It's obvious that they have been adapted quite a bit, but you can still see the fighting games roots showing through the different inputs for certain potentials.
Having an option or maybe a side-mode allowing people to do actual fighting games inputs faithful to the characters' original games (quarter circles, etc.) would be quite nice, but it's not necessary.

Not sure how I feel about what everyone else has been talking about since the release: I do agree that the old potential selection system allowed for more freedom in how it was presented, but I believe the new system is less confusing and makes it easier to create a coherent build for your character. As for how the combat feels, I feel like Ragna feels slower than I remember but Es still feels the same as far as I remember, so it might just be balancing and getting used to it.
(Appreciate the fact that we can select who we unlock first, I don't like Hibiki much compared to all the others characters the game has to offer.)

Speaking of, I'll have to see if Hakumen still destroys the games with the Triple Dash + Blink build as he did in the EA. I remember that build making Hard Mode a complete joke. Hoping to see more characters, we'll see if they're paid DLC or not, and how much they will cost. Overall, the initial selection as of 1.0 is solid, and the characters are distinct enough gameplaywise that they don't overlap.

Difficulty-wise, the game seems to have gotten a touch harder, but I don't dislike it, as at some point during the EA selecting Potentials granted extra Skill / Attack damage; making it so that by Zone 3/4 most enemies got one-shot with ease by most characters.

I'll have to play the 1.0 release more to give a broader review, but so far, I like it, and as someone that has played since the very beginning of the EA, I'm very happy with how the game has turned out so far.",1706823244,1706823464,True,5,0,0.577366411685943604,0,True,False,False

Original review:

The controls are tight, and the Blazblue characters play differently from each other, and are pretty faithful to their original fighting game incarnations in ""spirit"". This game overall has potential, but in its current early access state it suffers from barebones content and several bad design issues.

1. During a run you collect 2 types of powers, character specific powers (potential), and general powers (tactics). Potentials seem to make or break your build, but usually the tactics seem meaningless in their effects unless the stars align and you happen to acquire an amazing synergy combo. Another problem is each potential also buffs either basic attacks or skills (resource costing attacks), and it feels like unless you don't go all-in on one category of buffs, your damage output suffers severely, which heavily limits the amount of viable combinations and builds, forcing you to give up on some of the cool/fun ones in terms of how they play. Characters like Kokonoe and Hakumen also lack an invincible roll by default, which is fine in theory to add to character differentiation, but in practice an invincible roll is such an important fundamental mechanic in a ""Dead Cells"" inspired combat system that you may always end up taking the potentials that give them invincible rolls.

2. Lack of difficulty balancing. Currently there is the normal difficulty, and once you beat that you unlock the hard difficulty. The normal difficulty, which is the way most people will experience the game most of the time, has terrible balancing issues. More specifically, almost all of the run is mindlessly easy (i.e. boring), while the final boss is a massive difficulty spike. Currently it feels like a chore to play half an hour for a single 3 minute attempt against the last boss. The journey TO the final boss needs to be satisfying as well, and the final boss needs to be balanced to allow more builds and combinations to be viable against it. For comparison, in Dead Cells you got rewarded for getting to the final boss with more health potions, because each extra healing made a huge difference in that battle. Currently in BBEE, you easily get to the final boss in perfect condition, but it doesn't seem to matter anyway because you can get combo'ed from high health all the way to death without an opportunity to use those health potions you stocked on. The jump from normal to hard difficulty also seems a bit to too excessive, and could use some intermediary difficulties in between.

3. Lack of variety in stages and bosses. It seems each specific character only gets to experience specific 1st and 2nd stages and bosses, for no apparent reason, and the 3rd and 4th stages/bosses are always the same)

4. Very slow transitions between rooms. Why does my character need to cross from one side to the other, and also wait for slow animations to finish? Why does the rest room effect so long to finish and let me leave? Why does the potential acquisition animation take so long? Why does the Sortito room roulette spin for what feels like forever before stopping on the reward? All of these needlessly long pauses in the action add to the game feeling like a chore to play.

5. Last but not least, the big eye monster boss is terribly designed. It spawns one or two small enemies to kill, then forces you to wait 10 seconds, rinse repeat. For a boss in a rougelite that you should be encountering countless times, this battle is simply unacceptable.

The developers seem to be working very hard and are taking player feedback, so I hope they address all the issues I have mentioned and turn this game into something great, at which point I will happily update my review.",1693836230,1706805038,True,0,0,0.76328200101852417,2,True,False,True

[h2]I have never played or watched Blazblue[/h2]
In other words, rather than comparing the game to other games in the series, my review is based solely on the game itself. Other reviewers have mentioned how stiff and lifeless the Evotypes and Prototype units are, and I agree with them. However, this is a metroidvania roguelike, not Fire Emblem with some mystery surrounding humanity, thus I don't see any problem with it. It is a bit senseless to say it isn't fun, because it is for what is currently available.

The gameplay moves smoothly, and the controls are excellent. The diversity of each character distinguishes them from one another. Hakumen is strong and tanky yet moves slowly, while others achieve success in their own unique ways. There are actually 200 different play styles available to you, whether they simply alter the way your skills and
fundamental attacks work or provide you with an ultimate and other options. It's enough to avoid feeling monotonous. 

Personally, I think what makes the game a bit boring and uninteresting are the game stages itself, since they will repeat them often rather than being completely randomised or procedural generation. The game play is eye candy visually, and I like it with the SFX and combo effects. It also offers you incentive to continue pushing forward with how the evo / protos work in tandem with the story progression. If you fail to complete the challenges with a built from the Mind Training, you'll be off to try again with another build entirely since you only get one shot per character. I can definitely see how it could be annoying. It is, but I found it to be not so bad. 

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
I have never played or seen Blazblue before playing this game. The presentation of the game alone has me thinking about checking out the series whenever I get some free time. The asking price is within an acceptable and reasonable range for the content given. Except for the lack of English / Japanese narration, I have no complaints about this game, which is a mix of ripped Japanese voices from Blazblue and rather annoying Chinese narration. Which is something I absolutely despise as Chinese voices aren't the best in terms of anime/video games.

Edit:

Full release is better than Early Access, so much more content and overall and great experience. However, I do wish there was a bit more diversity in level design as it does feel scarce, though this may be due to the fact that I have played 14 hours. Also the PvPvE game mode ping is just way to high for the server they have currently at least for NA players.

Keep in mind this battle royale is so bad that after a single game, most players aren't even interested in trying again. It's that lackluster and buggy. It takes anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes to find a match and that was at prime-time BEFORE people even got a taste for how absolutely trashy it was.

So that's two promises broken, the other being that they wouldn't raise the price of the game, which they did, to counter steam's winter sale last year.

Then there's the lackluster roster of characters. 10 characters, all of which have been in the games files since EA began. They're already talking about charging for more content while the game is still super unfinished feeling and barebones.

Is the combat fun? Sure. The potential system is a neat idea.

The items/upgrades are so bland though, and they all effectively do the same things with different visual effects.

""Hit an enemy to set them on fire to do damage over time.""

""Hit an enemy to poison them to do damage over time.""

""Hit an enemy to summon a shadow that hits the enemy again, doing extra damage.""

""Hit an enemy to drop a light spear on enemies, doing extra damage.""

""Hit an enemy to drop a lightning strike on them, doing extra damage.""

It's all VERY similar upgrades and that makes it feel less ""roguelike"" and more ""Choose your costume"" so to speak.

The upgrades that do stand out often do so because they're simply the best in slot out of a very similar lineup of upgrades, not because they do different things or encourage you to play in different ways.",1698074306,1706779854,False,0,0,0.336438924074172974,0,True,False,True

What was released is much better and more convenient than what was before. System of potentials, synergy, enhancement with crystals... Everything has become better. The menu for choosing where to go after a cleared room has become especially better.

The fact that people say that there are fewer synergies is that they probably either don’t read or don’t know how to play the game. On the contrary, there are more synergies and they have become easier to find thanks to the new menu for selecting potentials.

- They have changed up meta progression (stuff that aids in further runs). Originally, you would grind the currency (AP), go to someone, and you could purchase various buffs, such as better chance of tactics (attacks that would inflict damage upon doing a certain action), more base HP, or more health potions to be used in a run. This has been removed and opted towards a more... ""hades"" esque approach but in a wrong way. Instead, you must give over the same currency to level up small portions of your HP, till you reach a certain ""level"" where you can implant a buff, like those prior, but to seven or eight. The problem is to implant the buff, you must consume five of a new resource that you 'occasionally' get from killing a boss or higher difficulties, and even then the one you craft will be a random buff out of the selections you do not have,. So you might get something good, or useless. Then you must sacrifice more AP to boost the shard. Overall it comes off as super tedious and just there to consume time and runs. You *can* buy more the resource to craft the shards, but even one takes an insane amount of AP to purchase.

-Potential, in this game are buffs in a run that allows access to more moves and more skills, but have been changed since Early Access (EA). Not incredibly much has changed but they have removed synergies. Synergies used to be made when two compatible potential's were selected and they would enhance one another. Such as a set of potentials for Ragna that gave life-drain effects on basic attacks as well as a damage buff but costed HP to use and another potential that reduced HP usage would combo together and greatly decrease HP-drain on swing alongside greater life drain effects. This all has been removed and is disappointing to say the least. There are some hidden synergies still in the game, but not as nearly as prolific or sought after as they once were. Potentials are more easily found now, but don't quite offer as much impact.

- Runs. Runs are more different than in the EA. To start with, there used to be an training gauge that would fill as you killed enemies and cleared rooms. As it reached 100%, you would be rewarded with a choice from any three tactics, as stated prior, a buff that give something if it's condition was met (attack, dash, etc) or give a flat buff. You could gain more of it by going into harder rooms, or buying it from the exchange shop, but this has been removed and instead you are given a list of different elemental rooms, you go into the rooms and complete it to get the tactic, however there are harder rooms that give a chance of better buffs while normal rooms often come with common buffs. Onto another removed system, the Corruption System. As you would go to each room, you would get higher and higher corruption, which could be lowered via resting. Upon getting above 100%, you ran the chance of getting a buff and a debuff, the chance being the total corruption minus 100%. So 120%-100, 20% to get the buff and debuff. Some really helped, some really hurt. It made decisions to risk the corruption for a good buff and a negligible debuff or having to clear to make sure not to get hit with a horrible debuff. This has been entirely removed. There are however more variety of rooms so I enjoy that, more parkour and challenges are nice. Some enemies got new stronger attacks and feel better to fight. Damage seems a lot lower however.

-The final section. Spoilers ahead. So the final section; Omega Space is a zone similar to Deadcells or Rogue Legacy style of mapping. Originally, when spawning in, you'd have the chance to get two rewards, one for killing enemies, the other for getting there in under 25 minutes. This has been removed and instead just a simple free HP pot is there instead. The shop has been changed as well offering everything to be purchasable there, tactics, hp, buffs, debuff removals, potentials, etc. The biggest changes however come from that they removed the original boss rush. So you would navigate the level till you find the final boss room... however, you could opt instead of going for him, but instead fight four bosses to gain a buff that would inflict a weakness onto the final boss, such as less HP, easier to stun, etc. But, now there are only two bosses, each just offering a generic potential and doesn't feel as nearly as rewarding.

There are some other complaints that I have, stuff that isn't confirmed or just not to my taste. (I miss the old UI, I find it cleaner). Attacks don't feel quite as impactful, and it might be because they are banking on people getting the 30% basic damage/skill damage buffs, I believe Dual-Tactics are no longer a thing (Tactic's of different elements could allow for picking a new tactic that utilized the two) but I haven't checked. It just feels like a downgrade to the Early Access and hope that game implements some of their loss systems back.",1706763171,1706763171,False,3,1,0.49227491021156311,0,True,False,False

After you've gotten far enough in the main quest, you unlock a mode where you go straight to the boss fights, but that mode is hampered by A: The damage you deal to those bosses is severely reduced based on the level of the character you take to the fight, and B: You can only use the character you bring to that fight *once*, since it's based on the data of the run you played in the main mode. Which also means if you only really like the boss fight portion of the game, you can't stay in these challenges very long before you're forced back to the default mode to get powerful characters for the challenge again.

I only unlocked Hakumen, Taokaka, and Kokonoe. The only other characters I'd really be interested in are Makoto Nanaya, Raechel Alucard, Valkenhein, Platinum the Trinity, or Jubei, none of which are in this game at all. And to be clear, the BlazBlue portion of this game is very arbitrary. It has effectively no bearing on the story told via the quests, and you could easily imagine the playable characters being swapped out with literally any other franchise with absolutely no change on the story.

There's also a multiplayer mode. I tried it once, it had +1 second input lag before my character responded to what I was doing so I immediately left that mode and never went back.

All in all I don't really like *playing* this game as it is very much. The parts I enjoy most are kind of relegated to a bonus feature at the moment.

The game is really pretty, though; I really like the animations, the dramatic dynamic lighting, and the character designs of BlazBlue (which have always had quite a bit of appeal).",1706748496,1706748496,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 Early Access portion:

After spending a couple hours it starts to make sense but im telling you the UI/UX experience is one of the worst I've experienced. The polish on graphics is wonderful...but explanations are so incredibly wordy it's a headache getting into the min/maxing aspect of roguelites. They dont explain almost anything in regards to upgrades or in-game currency that well & anything spoken is a one-time thing, no logs no nothing. if you miss something, you just miss it. 

There's so much help this game needs. With that said, the core experience once you get past the beyond-obtuse design is something special if not a little incomplete. This should definitely be one of the games fg devs pay attention to if this turns out right on release. They just need to fix up some stuff for better onboarding and maybe this could start a new trend.

[h3]TL;DR Some new upgrades that are pretty decent, some overhauls to gameplay, mechanics and UI. However, the slower combat changes, might piss a lot of people off. But I like it.[/h3]

Disclaimer:
I won't be playing online mode. Not my jam.

People are pissed that the game wiped their progress. Here's the thing, 1.0 is different from EA. It makes sense. Salty? Maybe. But they did announce it.

For anyone that played this during EA, will definitely feel a shift in gameplay. There are mixed feelings, but personally, I love the direction it went into.

Here are some of the things I noticed that have changed:
[list]
[*]Combat is slower
[*]User interface was reworked
[*]Mind upgrade mechanics were changed
[*]You can choose the skill/potential element you want to build towards
[*](De)/Buffs are permanent
[*]Each neutral room now give stat boosts
[*]Fights are still fair
[*]Difficulty is now modded to your liking
[/list]

[h3]The controversy[/h3]
So let's address the elephant in the room. Combat is slower. Yes it is. If you were riding high on the speed of the EA, this will feel crippling. I don't feel like it's the end of the world. I actually like it, it's more methodical and precise. This applies to enemies as well. It feels like you're more in control of your character as opposed to mashing buttons to get the most damage out.

[h3]Some quick thoughts[/h3]
I haven't delved deep enough into the Mind Upgrade mechanics, from my initial thoughts, it does elongate the game. Not a bad thing, but curious how many unlocks I can get into it. It has a gacha skill mechanic and I'm just going to push this under the rug until I put more time to give a fuller view on it.

Choosing elemental skills/potentials actually opens up the game to more builds. As opposed to choosing whatever the game spits at you.

Buffs and debuffs are now ""permanent"". They are no longer bound to how many rooms you entered. You can have debuffs removed at the exchange shop. I prefer this method so much more. I really hated the old mechanic handled de/buffs. It helps tailor you build even further.

Training/Neutral rooms now give bonuses to stats. Increasing your max HP/MP. Rewards for AP and so on. Not much feedback for this.

Fights are still fair. No seriously. I've only had three runs, and each of them, I got all the way to Susanoo. Obviously I'm not decked out with the best upgrades from reaching endgame content in the EA, but I found it to be fair.

So now, difficulty is no longer a ""select hard mode"". You can now customise it to your liking, unlocking more upgrades/plot points as you scale it. Think of Hades' inferno difficulty. Pretty much the same thing.

There's a training room. Kinda cool. But, it's a bit iffay.

[h3]Complaints?[/h3]
Just a few.

1. The user interface. It's been reworked. It looks better, but it feels very cookie cutter now. It's also scaled to take up the whole screen. I especially don't like it at the skill selection. I prefer the smaller 3 card selection. It felt more dynamic.

2. So remember there's now a training room. It's only featured when selecting skills. You have to select the Trial test option. They give you a training room with one passive-ish enemy. It helps you get an idea of the skill before selecting it. It works, but also, it's only during a run. I'm not the biggest fan as to where it is.

3. The store page artwork. Maybe it's just me, but it kinda feels AI generated. The original artwork was way better. That's all.


[h2]Early Access Review[/h2]

I once played Blazblue, many blue moons ago. I am just awful at fighting games. This game gives me some form of chance to admire the spectacle the series brings. 

As the game is in Early Access, I can confidently say, it's a great game already. I love rogue-like games but not many gel with me. This and Dead Cells seem to be the exception for the 2d-sidescrolling genre. 

2-hours may not seem like much, but thoroughly enjoying it. The UX might need some work, but it does seem to come from a Chinese developer. They may not get UX and UI 100% right with Western audience, but I find it suitable for now.

I'm playing this on mouse and keyboard and have had no issues with input lags or other issues. Might need some initial key rebindings, all in all, any deaths I have had so far were clearly of me panicking and timing things wrong. Can't wait to see what else the devs bring to the table.

[i]Generally, I review games through user experience, interface and gameplay. Don't really review a game for its graphics. Beautiful game, just not on my priority list.[/i]",1700675385,1706733534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

New between-run upgrade systems actually allow you to make a build instead of just purchasing the cheapest upgrades after every run, and the inheritance/potential system changes made them much easier to understand. And combos are mostly improved gamefeel-wise, i have no idea where people got the idea that inputs became clunky, that's just lies.

BlazBlue Entropy Effect is sexy. It sings and dances the second you get your hands on the controller. This roguelite owes much of its beauty to the animations and models it borrows from the fighting series it's spinning off from, but they fit Entropy Effect like a glove. Each fighter moves around the screen with personality, and each strike connects with a satisfying thunk and a dazzling display of spell effects.

This presentation and feel-level polish is where the game is at its best. It introduces some unique spins to the roguelite formula by turning your successful runs into flavors that sprinkle themselves on top of future ones; but samey build options prevent it from being a satisfying long term play.

The result is a stylish Blazblue spinoff that’s worth playing, even if not for as long as this genre label usually is.

https://youtu.be/qwikQgJL4dY

Entropy Effect’s style is more than just the inheritances it gets from BlazBlue proper. Sure, they’re a huge part of it: each of the nine (soon to be ten) characters has a full suite of striking dashes, swings and sprints. The gun and bomb wielding Kokonoe hops on her scooter whenever she wants to dash, and the ice samurai Jin may have a traditional looking one to start, but he can be upgraded into riding a shard of his favorite element that deals damage on the way in.

Everything looks, feels, and sounds fantastic, and reinforces the unique personalities of each member of the roster.

But elements that have been built around these fighter assets are no slouch: environments, enemies and even level transitions are stylish. The way that the health recovering and malady draining “rest” areas visually deplete your entropy (the games’ accumulating negative stat), is both a great touch and one of the many small ways that the game prides itself on being sleek and cool.

There’s a cyberpunk style that starts in the grim cityscapes you’d expect but eventually touches some more forested and rural backdrops too. If you’re here as a BlazBlue fan first and a roguelite connoisseur second then it’s worth playing for that alone: it’s well produced anime action in a simple rogue package.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3146037377

When it comes to the inverse scenario, approaching BlazBlue despite its franchise and not because of it, you start to bump up against some awkward build pathing and run structure.

The combat itself is great. You start with a spammable light and heavy, and a cooldown based skill. It’s a simple jumping off point that you’ll add to as you progress through the run. Additional combos, attack modifiers, and sometimes entirely new moves accessed via directional input are on the table; coupled with character agnostic passive boosts that you’ll be picking between every room or two.

These passive boosts are the lions share of the build selection, and end up hamstringing their own creativity by tying every choice to an element.

So many of the boosts reinforce damage of a particular element, so if you double down on fire passives everywhere then you’ll get multiplicative benefits when a “fire damage go up” option finds its way to your screen.

That’s only a slight oversimplification: sometimes the element you have won’t be among the three options presented, but I always found my most successful builds being the ones that adopted this philosophy. There’s little reason not to.

This gets exacerbated by Entropy Effects meta progression. There is a traditional currency-based shop that lets you purchase permanent stat bonuses, but the real cross-run power comes from legacy. Every run, successful or otherwise, gets added to an in-game hall of fame that lets you select two of those legacy runs to accent your new run.

You adopt an active skill from each of those runs’ characters, and a passive of your choice: which will usually be a powerful late game one.

These aren’t just small boons you start with but oftimes run defining powers. Pick two legacies that prioritized the same element, continue to prioritize that same element in your new attempt, and you have runs where you can be extremely powerful but also on autopilot; where your build is decided before the first enemy has even fallen, which kills a lot of the excitement.

There’s still enjoyment to be gleaned out of this system. It gives an invisible purpose to each attempt, allowing you to collect successful runs like they’re pokemon cards. These legacies are also the core of Blazblues non-rogue challenge modes, that stick a powerful boss or enemy horde in front of you and ask whether or not your build can handle it, which is a powerful incentive.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3146038125

But maybe most damning is every run’s insistence to end on a bloated final act. So many of the game's philosophies of speed, style, and quick transitions from encounter to encounter are dropped in act 5. Every run doesn’t escalate to just a final boss, but an entire final world complete with a format shift from menu selected battles to metroid-like mazes. It’s like a roguelite within a roguelite, exhibiting exploration, killing enemies, and finding mini-bosses within a continuous labyrinth.

Each mini-boss slain will nerf the final boss, but the time spent here is often fatiguing and just a little boring. Your build is usually complete by then and the debuffs the kills apply to the final boss are static, resulting in few decisions to be made. It often feels like you’re just pantomiming through this section, and it doesn’t help the illusion that the minibosses are all the same guys you fight on the main trip anyway.

It could have been cool as a novelty challenge you elect into for some runs, but as a mandatory run ender it’s a little too long, a little too decisionless, and a little too dull—especially compared to the four acts that precede it.

Dull, too, is the cross-run narrative that links everything together. It makes the decision to follow a talking computer in a cyberworld with equally personified computer friends. It tries to create some intrigue with your runs being monitored by big brother, but it fails to overcome the core problem that is not following the actual BlazBlue cast. It’s quaint and well presented, but doesn’t meaningfully attach itself to the reason you’re here, and it’s hard not to find yourself quickly skimming through it at best after a few hours. 

It’s weird how much I like BlazBlue Entropy Effect despite its pitfalls. It’s a game whose recommendation will be tied heavily to which itches you’re looking to scratch. As a roguelite, its legacy system does create some interesting meta progression incentives, but their powerful boosts end up cannibalizing a lot of the build crafting. The runs themselves are a bit too long to be the snacky arcade thrills the gameplay is, and the narrative is superfluous fluff.

But the satisfaction in the hitting-of-dudes and the way you look while doing it and the pretty levels you do it in really were enough for me, at least for ~10 hours. The enjoyment is frontloaded but it IS there. BlazBlue Entropy Effect may not be diverse or snappy enough to warrant permanent hard drive space, but you’d be missing out if you didn’t flirt with it just a little bit.

Now, us early access players lost our save data, which can feel kind of bad. The game has changed an unimaginable, inexplicable amount since the past version, so I understand the loss even if it hurts.

The removal of tactics XP and corruption buildup are a replacement of a cool but weird and complicated system with a very understandable one. The replacement of potential combinations with potentials that say their exact benefits on them when you pick them is a huge win.

Characters no longer have legacy effects that are as powerful as before, but instead allow you to inherit more tactics. This means that now you have less incentive to just always inherit from lambda for free healing.

Hard difficulty has been replaced with Hades' Pacts of Punishment/Heat system. This is awesome.

Because Mind Upgrades have been changed entirely you have less universal buffs, which means that things (especially early on) are a lot harder. I actually think this form of progression is more fun, though.

The last boss in the final early access build was trivialized, and the trivializing mechanics are now gone. This is rough, but a good change overall.

All in all, I think these changes are the right move, even if they are a shock to us as existing players.

EARLY ACCESS: I've completed most of what is currently available in this game at this time. I have only managed to beat the final boss on Normal once, because all of the bosses get new moves and become a significant challenge on Hard, while heals become less plentiful.

I beat all of the currently available tournament rounds. I love that system, where each run gets you one chance with the character you had when you failed or won.

Every character is incredibly fun, with a very different playstyle and moveset. The upgrade variety is also very large, with many combination talents to find and try. The gameplay is smooth and skillful, and while it allows you to spam silly moves, to do so risks losing control and getting you damaged. Overall, I have no complaints there.

I have no idea what the future holds for this game, but the state it's in right now is incredibly fun, and I'm looking forward to whatever comes next.",1694928786,1706717959,True,10,0,0.643920302391052246,0,True,False,True

as a fan of blazblue i appreciate new content, even if not by mori himself — this is one thing i like about the game, that the story does not toy with the existing story of blazblue. the gameplay has been fun since EA, although it has been a little hard for me to adjust to the new functions and such of the official release, e.g. some of the potentials being renamed as i have seen so far with Lambda and Ragna.
unlike EA, the official release is far more generous with prototype analyzer’s, which i am grateful for as i find hibiki rather boring to play as in this game (sorry hibiki fans). i was pretty happy to be able to unlock a character of my choice immediately after the tutorial, followed by two others in under an hour of playing.

as for my wishes for the future of entropy effect, i am hoping the roster expands further. i think mostly everyone is wondering whether Naoto will be added, considering he IS the games icon lol.
i would like to see more boss characters from the blazblue games, such as Takemikazuchi, Nu, or maybe even Nine.
a lot of people have also said this, but blazblue music would be cool too!!

overall the game is pretty fun if you’re a  fan of any of the characters in the roster.

Sadly I'll have to revoke that now that I got to see what 1.0 did to the game.

Starting with the positives:
I like that we get to choose what kind of upgrade or space to get next, mainly focused on the Tactics.
It was kinda inconsistent and punishing to have to fill up a bar or get lucky with an Event or Sortitio space to get a Tactic.
Now you're guarenteed one if you chose one for your next Space.


Now onto the bad:

Combos and feel clunky and slow.

Permanent Mind Upgrades like more HP Mixtures, higher chance for rarer Tactics or recovering up to 50% HP after a Boss Kill are not present anymore, instead we got this silly Mind Crystal function that are basically just what the ""Generic"" Tactics were in EA like ""Giant Killer"".

Corruption is gone. Negative and positive de/buffs seem to be permanent now. (?)

Can't confirm for other characters but Jin definitely got nerfed.
Why something in a Rougelike needs to be nerfed, unless its uber broken, I don't get.

And my biggest gripe with 1.0: The new Potential system

There was absolutely nothing wrong with the EA Potential system.
It wasnt hard to understand at all, all you had to do is press Start to look at the Potentials and what Potentials synergize with each other, not to mention that you had the little diamonds at the bottom of the Potential cards to show you how many Potentials are in this synergy.

I hope they revert alot of stuff here.

Here are some of the things I think they should've kept in 1.0 release.
- This is probably the biggest thing for me but I much prefer the old potential system and the potential synergies that brought to each build. It was really cool to see how each potential synergized with one another but now its just kinda boring because the potentials don't really affect one another.
- Previously in EA, when you time a dodge at the right moment to evade an enemy's attack, time would slow down slightly for you to whale on them. This was a universal ability and rewarded the player for skillful play. Now theres no more of that and the reward system of the combat definitely degraded. This ability alone made me wanna play other characters even if they were not my playing style since the combat has these micro-rewards laced into them.
- I enjoyed the previous feature where we could use points to permanently upgrade the characters from a shop. The mind upgrade is a common idea in rogue-likes, it empowers the players to fill the gaps of lack of skill and allow them to live longer in the run. This allows players to improve and get better at the game, eventually facing harder and harder challenges the game has to offer.
- Like some of the other comments have said, the combos feel quite off compared to EA. I am not quite sure what it is but it just doesn't land as smoothly as before. I noticed this when I was playing Ragna and I picked up the potential to bring enemies into the air. When I tried to use it, it feels like you have to be in kissing distance to the enemy to launch them into the air, otherwise you don't hit them at all. Maybe the hit box has been tweaked or something but early access definitely had smoother combos.

Now I will talk about some of the things I liked:
- I like how the room progression in the game is more fighting and less down-time. Each time I make a choice to go the the next room, as long as its not shops or events, I am fighting enemies to get the rewards.
- The ability to preview potentials in a virtual combat room is awesome. This is an excellent addition and one I really wanted to see in the early access. Allowing players to know what they are getting themselves into is a great design.
- I like how it is very clear what type of tactics I will be given, much easier to focus on a specific type of build than random tactics.

To tell the truth, I was very very in love with the game because it was something truly special in Early Access. However, it does feel like the magic is somehow not here anymore. I think if the core combat and potential system is reverted to the way it is, many players will flock back to the game and show love. I am giving it a negative for now but if the state of the game improves then I will be sure to transition my negative reviews to a positive one. Thank you for creating this game and I hope to see improvement and good designs.",1706691701,1706691701,False,361,10,0.738819539546966553,22,True,False,False

The variety is the biggest selling point of any rogue-lite and this one has it in spades with several characters to choose from and unlock as you make progress, the ability to take part of the pickups and skills your last character had before they died into a new character(as long as it's not the same character) is really unique and interesting.

Full recommend so far, I intend to play a lot more and as EA continues I might re-write this if something comes up.

Edit after 1.0 release: The game feels way different than it was before but in a good way.
The systems all work together better, the combat feels slower but at the same time more precise. The potential and upgrade system is a lot more aimed so you can control your builds better. I kinda miss the corruption system but the new way it's implemented honestly works better and affords you the ability to control it and be rewarded for it.

Overall, still love this, it's way better and all the changes feel good. Can't wait to unlock Taokaka and I hope more of the original cast is added as the game goes on.

Now I want it normalized for any 2D anime fighter. Entropy characters have surprising depth with their builds among some very intense boss battles. Making the builds feel like I'm piecing together the characters' actual kit from the fighting games but utilized in a very interesting way to where I can still do all sorts of flourishing combos on weaker enemies and finish them off with abilities that are similar to Astral Finishes.

It feels amazing to play and I think this is the main force that will drive you on to keep playing run after run the way the excitement of a new build might in other roguelikes. It's definitely not a 2d fighter by any means but its clear that the gameplay draws huge inspiration from the genre, and I'd say it's as close to a 10 in terms of pure combat feel as any roguelike i've played.

The visual design is also great, the lighting and effects really stand out and I think the environment design rocks. The enemies are a little uninspired, and as others have said they repeat a lot within their areas too. I hope this is something that changes as the game is added to, or I would consider this as a problem with the game. For early access standards I think it's fine to prioritise the characters and gameplay though. 

I think the only real issue I have with the game is that the roguelike elements themselves are pretty lacking. Not only are they sparse to begin with but they're all presented in a really uninspired way, literally just selecting tabs from a menu UI for all of the various types of room and upgrades you can get. I'd like to see this improved upon, bc as a roguelike I do think its a little lame to leave such a core part of the experience this underdeveloped.

As said earlier though, I think the combat goes so hard it's honestly worth playing just for that. The feeling of gradually unlocking what feels like a fighting game character's moveset over time makes them play so much more naturally for someone who loves fighting games but is bad at grasping the depth of a moveset right away. Building them up to focus on the moves that you have fun with is just a great experience and makes different runs play so differently from each other. 

Overall, a really incredibly strong start to the game imo, and I can only hope this momentum is kept up as it moves into full release and beyond.",1705544699,1705544760,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

The combat feels smooth and the controls are very responsive. I have to applaud the developers for making each character feel so unique to the point where you feel almost like you're playing a different game jumping between said characters after a run. 

Combining the tactics system (Which is what you would expect from roguelikes), with the potential system, which grants your character a new move to add to their kit during a run feels absolutely amazing and adds a much needed amount of depth since potentials on each character synergies with one another, opening up more ways to play. The bosses can be challenging, especially when first starting the game, but you feel yourself progressing, especially in your own skills the more you play.

There are not many characters right know but for a game that looks like a mix of Megaman with Devil May Cry with a lot of rouguelike mechanics there's more than enough to make you keep playing over and over. The game focuses on combat with some basic platforming in some advanced scenarios.

One thing that really shines is the big amount of skills you can find. Since it's a rouguelike you will need to pray for the RNG gods to get a lot of skills or a specific skill set you desire in a single run (I think they are called Talents) since there are a lot of ways that help you to unlock them in a run. These talents are passive skills or elemental effects that trigger under certain conditions like on specific moves you perform or on the press of some button.

There are other types of skills (called Potential) that are fixed for each character (kinda like a signature move or a special move set from a fighting game). [spoiler] These you earn from each boss you defeat and in some special rooms (I try to never skip these). [/spoiler] You may never unlock the same set of potential's in two full runs so choose wisely (I recommend trying each one at least once so you can know better each character). [spoiler] There are some Potentials that increase your jumps or dashes if you don`t like the other options (you choose one between 3 random options for each unlock) [/spoiler]

I didn't expected for a good story so I had no expectations and got a nice surprise when I found the story is not that bad. The story is a little confusing in the first hours but gets a little better as you play.

So much so it prompted me to buy another blazblue game just to see who might make it into this game. 

First and foremost the art and animation is top notch, it’s so over the top but still readable and with the way mechanics work in the game it’s very easy to get a grasp on after a few runs. 

With that I’d say make a careful look at everyone as when the game starts you can pick one character and are locked in until you get another chip for another, I almost put the game down as I picked the slowest character thinking I was really hamstringing myself, but not the case at all. Every member is just very distinct. 

Unlocks can be somewhat cumbersome as you have to navigate this citadel Esq area to unlock different bits of story and it’s hindered by a loading screen or two but otherwise the rest of the game is incredibly frenetic and energetic that it’s a nice reprieve. 

One highlight here is you know when you are in a roguelike and on a super super good run but you either finish or die and you get some takeaway but primarily you just lost the majority of the run? Well here all your runs good or not are logged on a board and you can fuse two of those runs into your new one. Taking the main ability and some of the buffs from each and adding them to a third character. This system is great. It also gives a “damn I remember that one” feeling and you can bring it with you, you can also use those specific builds in a ticketed arena mode for more unlocks. 

Simply put this game is a gem I play a ton of things from all genres and it’s often hard for something to really catch me but this has done it in spades. 

I love this game, I think you will too. 

Oh I also did try it with a fighting stick and you absolutely could play it this way I’m just not nearly proficient enough in a stick to do so",1704359465,1704359465,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The combat is dynamic and fun, they manage to translate alot of the character's moveset from the fighting game setting over to an action combat setting. Alot of characters are hard as balls to play though, the newest character Jin Kisaragi has one of the highest skill ceiling i've ever seen in a rogue-like combat but the rewards are immense, if you're lucky you can set your skill up so that basically every single rotation of your skill begins AND ends with iframe so you can chunk 1/3 of a boss health. My main is Hakumen, a slower, more methodical, samurai-esque beserker with a counter move and some grapple moves too. 

The biggest downside to the game is the lack of variety in runs compared to it's competitors, so far i've only manage to clear the game 5 times but it slowly felt like i've seen anything it has to offer, the only difference between each run is the character i use. There's also not alot of customization aspect to the game overall, your base is basically the same throughout the entire playtime, you unlock at most 2 - 3 things here or there but the layout and overall aesthetic doesn't change so it sometimes feel like you're not making any progress. 

Your character starts off weak at the start of every run and you need to get ""potentials"" to unlock combos and moves for your character making them stronger, i'd argue this is the only thing that can make or break your run since a faulty build or unlucky RNG basically just makes your character feels very tacky to play and hampers the dynamic of combat immensely. However, you are rewarded immensely if you manage to get a decent spread of potentials and your character will feel like a god at the end of every run. Other than that any other upgrades feels insignificant or just a slight bonus to help you out and have overall no influence on the outcome of the run at all. 

With that being said, it is an early access game and while there's not alot of variety, it is a decent roguelike and the combat is very fun. I'd recommended it however do pick it up on sale as i think at full retail it's a bit of a big ask (especially with the price increase leading to full release). 

TLDR: Fast pace roguelike, huge character pool, fun and dynamic combat. Gameplay lacks variety compared to games of the same genre and overall progression can do with a small touch-up. Grab it when it's on sale, full price is big ask.",1704279214,1704279214,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I just tried my first ""Mental Challenge"" and got beat down lol. I keep feeling like I'm missing something though. I'm not sure how to get other characters to be able to switch around through each training scenario, and I had to figure out the difference between each selection at the end of each round. Other than taking several stabs in the dark, I have enjoyed the game. 

I don't remember my characters name, but I chose the woman with the spear and the responsiveness during combat has been pretty good. You do have to be committed to your button presses though. If you just spam a bunch of inputs, your character is going to do whatever gets pressed first and you can't interrupt it. The bosses, er end of training bosses have been unique. None of them have repeated so far and each one required me to use all tactics I had learned up to that point. 

This is not a game where you can sit still lol. You have to keep track of what enemies have popped up and what their modes of attack are so you can hopefully dodge correctly, or stop one of them from casting, although I don't know if it would be ""casting"" exactly since they are robots lol.

I have spent a lot of time going through the levels and the environments and it really is such a pretty game. It plays absolutely incredibly with a controller and feels most natural (at least for me) and would definitely suggest that to anyone else looking to pick up the game.  That being said, I wanted to talk about what I think the game does well and what it lacks in.

Firstly, I'd say the enemy varieties are awesome and feel fresh every time you finish a stage and go to the next section.; The bosses are static and have no randomness so it isnt a true roguelike like something like Hades or something, but it has the same mechanics that you are able to choose different paths when you finish an area. You have a set amount of areas that you can go to per stage, i.e 1-8 would be the boss level, and going to a shop or resting or getting into a fight encounter all raises the increment by one level. 

That goes to say that the randomness of the game is all baked into the abilities you get when you upgrade your tactician level. The stages are all set so you will always start in the first area, then go to the second etc. so in terms of scenery it gets old after you've play about 20/30 hours. 

There currently isnt much in terms of an end game apart from potentially finishing up the current portion of their story right this second, but as its an early access I havent been paying too much attention to it so I cant really say too much in that regard and have been waiting for the full release to really give my opinion on the direction its going, but it doesnt seem too bad honestly. Just very generic so far.

the meat and what got me hooked on the game was the fluidity of the game. Everything feels fantastic, you can cancel out of almost any attack with a dash and it allows you to chain enemies for long times when you get ""potential"" to change up your moveset. It isnt like a traditional fighting game where you have every single move set unlocked from the get go, but you expand your array of moves by getting the Potential I mentioned earlier and choosing between three upgrades that increase either your skill damage, airborne damage, or your basic ground damage. each character is unique enough that they feel very different with each of their focuses. If you choose a skill build on one character (Noelle for example) you'll be firing lasers and over exhausting your mp to be able to spam your skills but have to wait longer for it to recharge in the meantime, but on another character like Mai for example, you'll be spamming tornado's and have insane aoe coverage.

For final thoughts I genuinely think that if you dont care about this not being an actual fighting game, but more an arcade game where you have slight differences and just want to play for the gameplay, you will enjoy yourself to the fullest. If you prefer more story and dialogue and look for something to chase at the end of the game, you'll be disappointed in the current state of the game.

Not what i expected from a blazblue game, but god damn it's like they made this game for me, a roguelite where i can play 30min at a time and have fun with the BB characters, count me in!

The game play loop is fun, fast pace and easy to understand, potentials make the combos and ability's so much more inciting, and having a incentive to play more then one character is really good for replay-ability.

This is not a game meant to push forward the IP in a whole new arc or direction. It's not meant to be a follow up for the storyline or give us information on anything within the world of Blazblue (At least not that I've seen so far). Do not expect this game to be the thing that FINALLY gives you the blazblue follow-up you've dreamed of. 

Instead, this game is a sick side-scroller hack-and-slash where you get to see some of the characters do REALLY cool stuff that would be ridiculous in the confines of a fighting game. You'll love this game if you:
A. Like seeing nutty combos and abilities that lay waste to tons of enemies while still being a fair challenge
B. Love the genre of side-scrolling hack-and-slash even if you have no idea what in the world a ""Blazblue"" is.

The game is fast paced and has randomized elements that encourage replayability. Despite being in Early Access, the game has quite a lot of content and diversity with its characters that you choose to start your run with. Choosing a character isn't just a matter of ""a different flavour of sword,"" but feature a different playstyle that do the fighting game counterparts justice. Roguelike and Roguelite elements have been attempted in many different games, but I really feel that this game does it right, to the point that I'd even compare it to Vampire Survivors. It's exciting to see all of the different things you can unlock in a run as you go through and gain an idea of what build you prefer to aim for. 

The potential negative is that there is a somewhat present storyline going on that seems to have nothing to do with the IP. Which, on one hand, is good in my eyes since the original creator is no longer with the company and the story is at a place where I'd be happy if it remained there. But on the other...I just have no idea or attachment to what's happening. In the middle of this action game with familiar characters is a strange 'Wall-E meets Cyberpunk mystery' plot that just keeps going. It wants you to 'figure it out' even if the player has no intention or desire to. It's not bad, it just feels like the game is forcing you to play something completely different for a little while after a few runs, where you're just dying to get back into the real game.

I also hope some bosses get tweaked like the tree guy, or some of the negative effects from a mechanic called ""Entropy"" are made SLIGHTLY less annoying. It's fine to have a consequence built in for people who are progressing without taking Entropy into consideration, but I think the game should still feel fun to play even if a person does have a high entropy level.

Finally, the names for all the mechanics are REALLY confusing at first. I thought blazblue liked to throw you in with new proper nouns, but this game throws you into a deep fryer and won't let you out until you learn the name of at least three of its uniquely named mechanics. There is a tutorial, but it seems to fail at teaching you just what these terms actually mean. (EDIT: This has been amended since this review)

The gameplay feels pretty good, all characters feel unique.
Storywise it has nothing to do with BlazBlue for some reason. At least after 10 h of play.
Though it borrows A LOT from games like Hades and Dead Cells, it has some unique features too.
You can play a fast paced roguelike as your waifu so that's a plus.
The artstyle is awesome.

I'm excited to see what new features will be added to the game in future updates.

Since the release and reception of HADES and the renascence it left in its wake, many games have tried to enter the roguelike/metroidvania arena in hopes of following in its perfectly-placed footsteps.  Sadly... most have failed to give us more than poorly-made, half-baked, near-clones that were rushed to market.  Still... several of them were able to show promise with interesting gameplay mechanics or systems that let us imagine how great the game could be.  In fact, a few of those games even managed to give us a somewhat satisfying story to lean into.  That being said, I've played a lot of them... and THIS GAME is the first one that has been able to rekindle that excitement I felt on my first run through HADES.  That, in my opinion, is a remarkable thing.

Graphics 10/10
Artistically, Blazblue Entropy Effect is brilliant.  I'm a very tough anime critic... and there is absolutely NOTHING wrong here. 
 They NAILED it.  100%.  They've always done a great job with the art in their fighting games and I knew that going into this one.  Be that as it may, I was absolutely caught off guard and blown away when I jumped in for the first time on Ultra Settings.  If I'm being completely honest, there is probably more drool on my monitor than I care to admit because of this game.  From the lighting effects to stage design... the character models to the attack effects.  It's visually breathtaking.

Gameplay 9/10
The gameplay is outstanding. Each character has their own animations and they all jump/attack/dodge far better than most games in the genre.  In my experience, transitioning from a 2D fighter to a platformer (historically) doesn't go well when it comes to mobility... but this game is definitely an exception.  As I played, I was getting BIG arcade vibes and kept instinctively feeling my pocket for extra quarters whenever I died. LoL.  Truly, the only thing missing for me... wall jumps.  That's something I would for sure love to see them add.

Story & Dialog 7/10
I won't get too much into the storyline (so as not to spoil anything).  Although, I will say that the dialog was playful and often comical (at least to me) which contrasted well with the cold, digital setting.  I wouldn't say anything was Emmy worthy, but it definitely worked and kept me from fast forwarding.

Overall *9/10
The game is in early access and even though there are a few things I'd like to see slightly altered or added... I can't see anything ""wrong"" with the game.  I will definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to play something new and challenging.

I'm currently playing this with a Mayflash F500 V2 on my PC and also on my Steam Deck.  Runs perfect on both.",1702289568,1702289568,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First off, one major gripe I have is that there's no procedural generation. Every time you boot up the simulation, the same maps in the same order greet you. It gets repetitive, quick. 

Second, as others have said, difficulty scaling. For example, play Es, save credits to but a potential, and if you get the potential that gives all of your basics a crest, you win the game. The final boss is a joke with the correct Es setup. 

Third, tactics. Tactics feel really dull. They're very passive, so it's not super awesome to get a potential you're looking for, and some of the tactics (like burn, cold, whatever) barely even contribute to you're DPS. The balancing for tactics is pretty bad too. Like, most cold tactics are absolutely not worth it because the 10 stacks of cold thing that the devs stole from Hades is awful in this game. Oh yeah, this game borrows a lot from Hades. Play both and you'll see what I mean. I found myself saying ""that's literally just [insert boon name from hades]"" pretty frequently. I'm not too experienced in rogue likes to know if the devs borrow from other games, but for sure Hades. (not an inherently bad thing just saying).

Fourth, the Blazblue integration feels really weird. I heard from someone else that the blazblue characters were added last minute, which i didnt fact check. It sure feels like it though, with the overworld having absolutely nothing to do with blazblue. I'm also just not in the know about blazblue, so.

idk. It's fun, but if you're considering buying it, just wait until it fully releases. (if you really want to buy it just buy it. Know what to expect, though)",1701838991,1701838991,False,26,1,0.346042275428771973,0,True,False,True

First, it has zero relationship with the actual Blazblue universe. It’s just some of their characters dropped at random in a cyberpunk-ish VR world with robots.

The visuals and animations are superb, but I have no idea how much isn’t straight up BB fighting game assets. I think i’ve seen some of the enemies somewhere before too. In any case, the same is stylish in its presentation and it’s pure eye candy.

The combat is great too, characters start pretty shallow but once you unlock a few potential 5 min into a run, things start to take shape a lot more. By the end, it’s pretty damn flashy.

The evotype system, where you can use the saved “characters” of your previous runs to boost your future ones is a great idea and it incentivises playing with every character. I hope to see a system like this in other games, it’s awesome. The tactics are your run of the mill roguelike powerups but they have good synergy and are quite powerful, even if they don’t change much how you play.

My big issues with the game are these:
- low low low variety. At the moment, there are 5 levels, they are always the same, same enemies, same rooms in different orders, same music, same everything. It gets old very fast. Over time, there needs to be more levels branching out so every run won’t be “cyber city -> lab -> ruins -> japanese cyber city -> mini VR dead cells” . If not, more room types/challenges and enemy type for each of those would really help alleviate everything feeling samey. I had the same issue with Gunfire Reborn where it’s always the same levels in the same order. For something you replay over and over, variety is key. The characters really do the heavy lifting here, no doubt about it.

- the story is uh… there. The constant interrupting when moving around the base is irritating. A button to skip the dialogue entirely would be very nice. Mashing “A” for 20 seconds (and then another 20 seconds moment later because some robot friend calls you on your way out) is a friction point. No one is playing this for the story.

- as mentionned earlier. The Blazblue characters feel so incredibly out of place. They have no purpose in this world. They feel slapped into another game. I think the game would’ve been better had there been original characters… that being said, this quality of spritework and and animation is not something that can reasonably be expected for a small dev team so I’m not really putting too much weight on that. It IS a bit jarring though.

If you like stuff like Dead cells, Astral ascent, etc, this is a really fun game. The positive side of using already done BB assets make it much easier to have a wide roster of characters. Those that are there are all great and play 100% differently from each other. I can recommend it and i hope it improves over time!",1701299068,1701299068,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

From what I understand, the only connection to BlazBlue universe is just using their characters as ""puppets"" that you run around with, but that doesn't stop the actual game from being: 
Very responsive, your character does exactly what you want and expect 
Satisfying, as there's just enough hitstop on big attacks that you can feel the ""oomph"" for them
It also translated the fighting game feeling incredibly well - especially the ""goddamit I whiffed my defence/parry/dodge, now I'm gonna eat shit"" part. 

There is a very interesting system of meta-progression, where not only do you get to unlock some direct power (i.e. more health, better chances at higher rarity buffs etc), but you also get to use a part of your previous runs on other characters!

You are looking at the skeleton of a deep, thoughtful roguelite with the skin of Blazblue draped loosely over its frame, which is also concealing some vestigial narrative elements and a clashing art style. Luckily its mechanically sound joints hold the beast together through its fun gameplay loop.

[h3]What's Working?[/h3]
- Fun, frantic, and challenging combat.
- Mechanically distinct characters that evoke their host game.
- Tons of systems to play with and combine. Passives, unlockable moves, and synergies.

[h3]What's Clashing?[/h3]
- Main plot is dull and often harangues you between runs.
- Nothing outside the playable characters (and some bosses, sometimes) evokes Blazblue.
- Poorly explains its systems.

[h3]Recommend To:[/h3]
- Anyone who felt Dead Cells played it too safe with the Castlevania crossover.
- Anyone whose knowledge of Blazblue lore begins and ends with ""The Wheel of Fate is Turning.""
- Action game fans who measure a game's mechanical density by how much smoke their rig generates.
- Roguelite fans with bizzare pizza topping preferences.

[h3]Alternatively Suggest:[/h3]
[b]- Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night:[/b] A slower paced, more traditional metroidvania with tons of expression via different weapons, spell shards and even hairdos. It's even got a few roguelike randomizer toggles if that's your bag. Doesn't clash with itself as much, but only because BB:EE sets such a low bar.

[b]- Indivisible:[/b] Maybe you wanted something with fighting game elements that isn't a fighting game? Gorgeous art direction paired with a unique, input driven RPG combat system. If you need a convoluted story to go with it, just look into the history of the developer!

[b]- Teppen (Mobile):[/b] Maybe it's the fighting game branding you wanted, but not the whole ""get bodied in a fighting game"" experience. Now instead you can get bodied in a realtime dueling card game! But hey, at least you'll be Ryu, Akuma or Morrigan while it's happening. Sorry, forgot I'm talking to a potential Blazblue fan. At least you'll be Morrigan while it's happening.

BB:EE is great to play, boring to read, eager to tell me everything other than how to play it and works best if you don't think too hard about the BB part of the title. A muddy game gets a muddy recommendation from me. Best enjoyed by people seeking that roguelite action bliss above all else, as the richness of its systems playground smooths out a lot of its other jagged edges.

I also reviewed those other games that caught your eye during a freak sale or an adventurous jaunt through Steams' discovery queue. [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43226863/]Check out my Curator Page for more[/url]",1701135137,1701150509,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You start out with one button per effect - jump, skill, attack, dash. As you progress you gain ""Potential"": these unlock completely new moves and upgrades to existing abilities, changing their functionality significantly. This is unironically [b]the most impressive upgrade style I've seen in any roguelite[/b]. 

For example: 
My default attack is multiple chained attack button presses - 3 hits, maybe 4.
Through Potential I unlock the ability to launch the enemy into the air by pressing jump after any ground attack. Now my combo is (naturally) 3 hits + one to get airborne + 2 hits for my aerial attack.
Later on I upgrade a juggling aerial move that triggers when I push down + attack while midair. Now my combo is 3 ground hits, + 1 launcher + 1 aerial attack + 3 juggle attacks with a wicked cool downward strike finisher. 
My input for all this has been: X X X A X hold down while hitting X X X. It's [i]just that simple.[/i] I'm practically button mashing but each input has a different effect that combines with others into an elaborate system that would unironically be at home in an actual fighting game.

By the time I have reached the end of the game I have learned, step by step, to execute elaborate combos in under 30 minutes. They're simple to execute but complex in usefulness and it's outright [i]amazing[/i] how well all this is pulled off.

BlazBlue is a fighting game series that (at least to me) is known for trying to make complex combos and fighting game stuff more accessible to casual scrubs like me. BlazBlue Entropy Effect is a shockingly effective extension of that philosophy wrapped up into a comfortable roguelite package. It's fun, engaging, and makes you feel awesome not just by giving you an OP set of abilities (though those totally exist too) but by training you to be a competent fighter with lots of tools in your belt by the end.

It unironically may be the best roguelite game I've ever seen and it's still in early access. 
My only complaint, honestly, is that you get too few Potentials and that the storyline is a bit sparse - but honestly you're probably not playing roguelites for gripping storytelling and the gameplay is just [i]so satisfying.[/i]

Its difficult at early, but after unlock permanent perks. You got more HP and better chance for high skill/tactic. It become easier. But the Hard Difficulty is just too much, some debuff gave Damage DOT for the whole Boss scene. So its almost impossible to score higher than 1,500 BP.

Combat is the highlight here as you'd expect from a fighting game turned roguelike. The evolution of your character during a run is addicting and it feels good to experiment with everything. Really well done and hard to stop playing once you're in a rhythm.

-Very interesting and unique characters offering a variety of game play styles.
-Many viable builds and synergies for each character and each run.
-Fluid game play and vibe.
-Unique progression system with saving a completed or dead characters build can increase the power for your new characters run or used in certain challenges.

Negatives
-Wish there was more randomised and larger variety of biomes.
-Many of the skills don't really tell you what they do and how they function exactly. You'll need to actually try it yourself, even if it can diminish the potential power of a characters during that run.

The combat, in particular, stands out, with the ability to unlock potentials during runs, providing skill unlocks for diverse combos akin to a fighting game.

For this being fresh out of alpha its more polished than any Bethesda game that's come out and ridiculously fun. Some characters take more time to get used to that others, Kokonoe looks broken but has a high skill curve, the same for NU-13 which is ironic compared to her usage in the fighting games.

Looking at the previous reviews, it seems a lot of negative ones came from fans of the series who are frustrated that time isnt being spent making a new fighting game. 

BlazBlue Entropy Effect came out of nowhere this August. I hadn't seen any marketing or lead-up to the Early Access release, so when it dropped, I was pleasantly surprised to see an established franchise picking up on the gameplay loop of the 2018 Neowitz release, Blade Assault. Blade Assault, while somewhat thin on content after the 20 hr mark, never got the love it deserved or really hit the mainstream. The beat-em-up side-scrolling gameplay mixed with an impressively varied moveset for four different characters blended quite well with the rogue-lite loop of rise and grind. Like many Neowitz titles, Blade Assault presented an excellent spin on the roguelite genre, but simply didnt have a large enough dev team or budget to take their great ideas all the way home. 

For those who have played Blade Assault, booting up BlazBlue Entropy Effect (BBEE) will be a bit of deja vu as they both follow identical control schemes and gameplay loops. Within the first few minutes of your first run, you will be introduced to the biggest upgrade from Blade Assault with the ""Potentials"" that are selected from special events or winning boss fights. BBEE has the typically roguelite ""level up and choose between three upgrades"" mechanic during a run which was the main way of mixing up runs in Blade Assault. However, the addition of Potentials [b] significantly [/b] ups the ante by allowing you to choose from entirely new move sets activated in combat through similar mechanics to a fighting game. Full runs of the current game mode allow for up to 5 or 6 Potential selections throughout, and by the end bosses, you have an absolutely WILD number of combat options. 

The inclusion of Potentials clearly takes inspiration from the fighting genre and adding these types of combat tactics into a roguelite sidescroller is honestly genius to the point where I am shocked nobody has attempted it before. Each character can have such wildly different builds in each run that I would have been happy with 2 or 3 characters to choose from at this point in Early Access. But no, there are SEVEN (I think...) character choices at this early stage in development, all of them with various branching gameplay styles as you gain Potentials. Variety is always the make-or-break element of an action-roguelite, and BBEE makes it VERY easy to sink 3 or 4 hours into each sitting.

Alongside the superb gameplay variety are an interesting set of environments that change from standard beat-em-up scrollers to a full metrodvania map on the final stage. I would love to see BBEE expand on this metroidvania element and add in more options for the path that gets taken on each run, but considering the game has only been in EA for 3 months, I am confident that this extremely talented dev team will expand upon the ideas that currently exist. 

Technically, the game looks very nice and has a good set of tunes bumping as you demolish hordes of interesting and varied enemy types. It runs extremely well on my computer (which isnt saying much with a 4070ti), but more importantly, has run like butter on Steam Deck since it first came out. I dont have a ton of time to game throughout the day, so 5-10 minute sessions on my Steam Deck are sometimes all I get to enjoy, and BBEE has been open on that baby for the last two months. Its a shame since I have so many other great games. This one is just... better.

There is plenty more that I could say about the interesting arena combat mode and legacy tactics between runs, but I feel like people should just buy the game. Seriously, if you have any interest at all in having fun, this should be a no-brainer. Even the story, while not center stage at all, took me off guard by actually making me laugh a couple times. 

BBEE is still very early in development, but already brings to the table more content, creativity, and plain old fun than most other fully-launched titles in the genre. Comparing it to Blade Assault shows why building spin-off games from existing IP can be so successful. With the universe, characters, enemies, and complex combat mechanics already established, the developers can focus more effort on making the actual gameplay as fun and varied as possible. The criticisms I have are so massively outweighed by the good that I dont even feel the need to mention them.

This game is only going to get better. Jump on the bandwagon so that once this game blows up, you can say you were there first. Right now its an EASY 4.5/5 and without a doubt will be a 5/5 game at its 1.0 launch. Also, its 20 bucks.

What’s Great:
Combat Mechanics: Reminiscent of classic fighting games, offering intuitive controls and a diverse character roster, each with a unique set of moves.
Visuals: Strikes a nostalgic chord with its 2D arcade-style graphics, boasting impressive detail and a powerful aesthetic.

Possible Improvement:
Roguelite Elements: The game could benefit from more distinctiveness in this area. My perspective on this may be a bit subjective, as I haven't explored many Roguelite games beyond Hades and Dead Cells. I envision a system where players can customize character movesets, adding depth and strategy to gameplay.

Looking Forward:
PvP Mode: The addition of PvP combat, both in duels and team-based formats, would be a fantastic expansion. Always excited to fight other players. 

In all, BlazBlue Entropy Effect is a solid game with room to grow. Its blend of traditional fighting mechanics with innovative roguelike features makes it a standout title. Here's hoping for continuous improvement.

[b] This game has a really fun concept that I would really like to see explored more, however, I believe that competitors are able to provide a more fulfilling experience at a similar price. [/b] 

Let me start off by saying that I have never heard of BlazBlue before this game. I was hoping that this game would have more variety in its combos, however, the game is not balanced in a way that allows for much build variety. The game is balanced in a way that almost requires the player to level up the same string or attack if they are looking to succeed. I found this frustrating because it made the game very repetitive.

I also had issue with the difficulty spike between regular gameplay and the bosses. Throughout my playtime I have fought two bosses and noticed that I could practically walk through the regular enemies, whereas the bosses became a massive struggle. This difficulty spike shatters expectations and can lead to player frustration. This ties into the limited build variety because this is where the player is almost required to focus on leveling a specific string in hopes of beating the difficulty spike. I hope that in the future there will be more focus on enemy variety and increasing the difficulty throughout levels, as the gameplay feels very repetitive and unsatisfying in its current form.

As far as I can tell, the BlazBlue IP has nothing to do with this game beyond playing as characters from the franchise, which leads me to believe that it is within the realm of possibility that the devs could be charging for the IP rather than the gameplay experience, however, their support of the game and response to any of the criticisms will be the deciding factor here.

I really do want to see this game succeed, and I will happily update my review if my experience is different once I unlock more characters, spend more time in the game, or if my issues are resolved. At this moment I find the game hard to recommend purchasing for $20 when a game like Dead Cells or even the recent Risk of Rain Returns offer a significantly more enjoyable experience for a similar price range. 

I plan on continuing to explore more of the depth of this game and continuing to watch its development, however, I cannot recommend the game in its current state.",1699719767,1699719767,False,3,0,0.465798020362854004,1,True,False,True

The item/perk system of the game is ok, nothing extraordinary, but good.

Code wise there must be some sort of memory leak as I'm get lag every screen, hope to see that addressed in the future.

As well as some actual complaints I hope they update. I'll start with my personal ones. And I'll throw in some things I really like about the game. (Btw I do love this game)

Personal Thoughts:
Mostly just design wise, the enemies are honestly really basic. For me, I know Blazblue for their amazing character designs, stage designs, and more. But some of these enemies look boring to the eyes. I know it's not really in the world of Blazblue but c'mon. Speaking about that (nice transition amirite?) I think this game actually would be a pretty good way to string in some other fighting games as well (like Blazblue Tag) but I highly doubt it. I wish they add more characters though. And I hope they allow the alt color schemes into the game.

Actual Thoughts/Complaints:
Although I like how throughout the game you get more moves by potential theres some moves I wish could be unlocked by skill tree for each character instead of getting them through potentials. This way when you start the level instead of having fight boss fights for (arguably) small moves that should've been in their move set by start you'd already have them in your arsenal. Someone had mentioned this game feels like if you replace the game with any another character it wouldn't be any different since no one ever mentions anything about the characters or even interact with them. They don't do anything for the story but thats not something 91Act could change. but I do hope they allow skill trees for the characters.

The story is still being made so I won't be touching on that subject until the full release only will be covering gameplay. So far by the time of this review we have 8 characters each with unique mechanics and perks.  

During a run we you go through 4 stages with a total of I believe 5-6 different stages. Enemies seem to mostly be stage exclusive as a run goes on your entropy builds up. Entropy when you begin to get high amounts of it will give both positive and negative effects that will impact your run. Similar to Hades as you go on through runs you get currency that allows you to buy permanent upgrades that can help out in future runs such as increased health, more health potions and increase chance getting rarer quality tactics to name a few of the upgrades 

 Tactics are universal perks that players get most commonly through combat helping with damage as well as providing some utility as the run goes on.  Potentials are gained most commonly by beating the bosses at the end of each stage potentials are character based and help each character differently.  Getting multiple potentials with synergy can open up new moves and playstyles.

I have a lot of thoughts on the game as it stands right now. I'm open to edits. Your power creep is rather satisfying. Figuring out what pathways for level ups is quite satisfying. Some of the elements are fairly weak right now. I would like to see more ways to apply some debuffs more quickly. The story is actually really good. I can't wait to see further updates to it because I believe I've exhausted all the story bits so far. The mystery kept me coming back for more. The gameplay is just as chaotic, tight, and controlled as Hades in a different plane of play, to me. I cannot think of a higher compliment I can give to a Roguelite, period. The characters really stick true to their Fight Game counterparts. The current lack of Jin, Hazama, and Taokaka must be addressed. I love how all of them feel quite a bit different from one another. That just makes me feel all sorts of good. There's a lot of love in this game.

Having said that, I do have some gripes/constructive criticisms. The game cuts off dialogue.... A LOT. Like, most of the time, it's right at the end of dialogue. However, your lady friend's calls can overlap on each other and end one call abruptly to start another one. This can lead to some REALLY confusing moments and really break the flow of the story. I do think they will smooth a lot of this out with further updates, but I would like to note it is present as of the Es update. Kokonoe and Hakumen really need some form of damage reduction or armor on their dashes without Potentials. It makes some hard mode bosses more annoying than they really need to be. You can't break the formula like that without some weird consequences. The Desert Serpant boss is a really good example. His Dust Devils are a hell of an annoying impedance with those two whilst all the other cast can fight him a little more fairly. It's an unnecessary gimp for other less useful for this game mechanics. Some of the cast's air to air is kinda bad. Maybe we could rework the Sakura City boss with a few more ground based attacks along the way because she can turn into a bit of a slog for a few in the cast. I will say her hard mode version is a bit better, but the same problem exists. That boss can sometimes slow down a run in a game where everything else is so fast paced and fluid. Smace Omega could use an aesthetic rework, imo. All the other back drops are really cool, but for a final area, it lacks the feel. I had a thought you could maybe have glitch into the final boss area as you run through cause that is a HELL of a cool area. Bro, this is just a personal, for real. Let us choose our colors.... Blazblue has some of the best color customization in the entire FGC. Bring it into the game.  

Overall, I'm so very glad I bought this game. Gripes aside, what is here can be considered a full satisfying game. I have no doubt further updates will make this game a regular come backer for me that probably has a permanent spot on the install list. Well done. Keep going.

Edit 1: Hakumen's dash is actually just fine. I spent some time bullying a few runs with him the past few nights. I still think it's weak at base, but Potential builds around it can become very insane, very quickly.",1696242301,1696504962,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

It's got solid combat, with the soul of a fighting game inside a roguelike. The bad? It's obviously a bit unfinished atm and it's really hard to say how good this'll be down the line as I have no idea how much content they plan on adding. 

For comparison's sake, Dead Cells is probably my favorite title in this genre and it blows Entropy outta the water in most ways: content, replay value, customization, etc. However, this game is quite unique compared to everything else, so I have high hopes for it. I've had a rock-solid experience considering this is a EA title, with the worst problems just being occasional slow downs as the frame rate'll dip. I'll caveat that with the fact that I played this mostly on my Steam Deck however so a normal rig should do just fine?

To close this out, the world, characters and combat are top notch imo and it was really cool being able to experience that outside of a traditional fighting game, as I suck at those.

I'm hard to please on this aspect and it does give a good variety of things you can do without roadblocking the player aside from unlocking characters.

Quick Review: Medium speed rogue combat similar to DFO and Blade Assault. Story is (as far as I've played) not related to combat, however still is interesting. Unlocks and upgrades are helpful/makes things easier over time but don't feel like crutches or feel required to finish a run. And the more things you do the more variety you can choose from.



If you like or never heard of BlazBlue this game is still good equally I find.
However you may or may not like that combat isn't fighting game controls but simplified a bit.

I'm doing a non-biased review here as I have played BlazBlue before but I can recommend this to anyone who likes side scrolling combat games.

Basically you do a side scroll beat em up with some minor platforming. As much as I've played so far: It feels good and not too much on the platforming to take away from the combat. 20XX did this and I did not like that part of it. Combat is not too slow, it's a little on the fast side but NOT turbo hyperdrive, so it hits a perfect spot for me.

Two main types of rewards from doing combat.
You have tactics generic-ish boons that any character can use (99% sure). You get these by doing combat or buying EXP.
And Potentials which are character specific unlocks that add more moves and combos to your arsenal. These are rare and are obtained from room choices or gotten as a level boss kill.

Tactics ones are like you'd fine in other rogue games. When this happens -> this effect happens. You can stack this and there are combos or double effect ones or such. I'm probably getting part of this wrong as I am unsure what counted as a double effect one. The one NPC said I had unlocked all of them but I wasn't sure if I have ever seen one...? Either way they're pretty basic and easy to understand except for maybe one or two.

Potentials are more character specific moves from the games. On top of that they provide a passive bonus as well, so you can choose based on the move or the bonus. They also have combos with other moves which add even more effects. This is what really tickles my combat variety bone. As when I'm deciding on a potential to take I'm weighing the pros and cons of each part of it rather than just picking the combo one instantly. They can extremely change combat styles or add new attacks.

Lastly there's another thing called entropy and corruption. This is basically the curse system of Curse of the Dead Gods. After every some room choices you get entropy which builds up and you get a chance of getting a Boon AND a Curse. You can lower this if you don't want them by resting or stopping by a shop to buy an entropy lowering item.
The boons and curses are random to what gets connected with what, unlike curse of dead gods.  So you might have a realy good boon or a really bad curse. Luckily, and unluckily, these only last for a few combats or rooms. There is a more heavy version called ""Critical"" when entropy goes over 200, but it is a bit confusing how they put it so I've just avoided it cause it just sounds bad.

The characters all play uniquely. There's a good mix of range and melee attacks with them.
I like this: Combat is simplified, it's similar to a fighting game but without intricate fighting game inputs: You get buttons for ""Basic attack"" ""Skill Attack"" ""Jump"" ""Dodge"" two shared skill buttons from other characters called Legacy Attacks, and a heal potion button. So potentials explain decently how to activate the potentials you unlock. Down +Basic Attack for instance. Skill Attack into Dodge or jump. There are no fireball, dragon punch, or half circle things (*yet, this may change*).
And let's go onto one last thing. 
Each run you do after you've unlocked a second character (and third) you can bring the abilities of two other characters, this is called ""Legacy"", I just mentioned it. You also get a couple of traits too... based on how you play (read on to understand)

Each run you do you get a rating. I'm assuming without reading all of the discussion or such that this is based on how many things you've unlocked, how far you have gone and the other people you brought with you at the start. I am making an educated guess at this because I've beaten 2-3 bosses before and gotten 250-300 rating, and times when I just kill one level boss and bring other people and get 350+

TLDR: The better you do on each character, it saves a record of and you get to combine peoples attacks and some of their equipment on previous runs. It really helps to mix up the combat style of the game.

Okay so.... wow I've actually said a lot of good things about this. There are a few cons I need to bring up.
- A couple of the attacks I'm sometimes confused if they're enemy attacks or my own, like Kokonoe's sky laser bears a resemblance to one  of the bosses lasers. Most of the attacks I can tell but sometimes it gets lost in the carnage and I can get hit.
- It's a little hard to understand a couple things. Like ""Potentials"" can be explained by  saying in game ""This unlocks character moves"". As when I first saw ""Potential"" come up as a room choice I just picked it cause I was curious what it was.
Entropy should be explained as ""causes good and bad things to happen"" and 'if it builds up too much something really bad could happen""
- At the point I am in this, the story feels like it has extremely no connection to the combat. Outside of combat you are a little robot. And in combat you are playing one of the BlazBlue characters. I have read that this is a non-canon story or such but I haven't done enough research. The story is okay. I'm not complaining, I'm just saying that ""what is the connection between the story and combat?"" Why are we specifically BlazBlue characters in combat? Maybe this gets explained at release.
~ I mentioned above that combat controls are simplified and you don't have to do fighting game style motions to do them. Personally I think this is fine, some people might not like it. So this is your mileage may vary.
~ Some rooms are so small it is extremely hard to dodge AOE explosions. This is not fully a con as I love variety. But it feels like it could chill out on the AOE explosions in the smaller ones by a little bit.
- I would like some explanation on how SP, MP and cooldowns go. Maybe labeling skillis that only recharge based on combat or such would be helpful.
- For everyone, some better clarification is needed on some skills that are at the same time, or in sequence. This can be cleared up if the devs put in ""Down + Attack"" and ""Jump"" -> ""Dash"" -> ""Attack""  for sequential things.
- Character unlocks feel weird. They're given through collection quests or doing a specific ""challenge"" after a certain story sequence. I personally would suggest that you can pick from more than one character at the start, then unlock the others. (Side note: I actually was surprised it's not Ragna, considering he's a staple character of BlazBlue, this part isn't a complaint)
-""challenges"" are odd because you have to  use a failed/(or finished?) run to fight a boss or enemies. They don't feel like challenges just like ""fight the boss"". Maybe that's okay?
** Devs: You all promise not to add things locked behind ""You have 1 HP good luck!"" and I'll be happy **

That's really about it. 
On the Blazblue side, I have only basic knowledge as I haven't played it in a long time. But I did find a few of the things tickled the fanservice bone to the things I know. But it wasn't enough to overpower the combat or make it so I wasn't interested in the regular game story.

That said the game does need a LOT of work before it's full release. The combat is tight and really fun but if this was a full game there is just too much lacking for it to be able to last.

Difficulty: The base difficulty is honestly a little too easy. Outside of the final boss the game is a cake walk. When you unlock hard difficulty it makes things a little better for boss fights but the normal areas are still just breezed through. For reference, other then a few enemies, I never really worry about what kind of attack pattern the enemy has or who they are since they are rag dolls before the character's combos. There has never been a time, even on Hard mode, when I've ever felt like it's justified not to take Extensive training EVER! I would like the feeling of clawing my way through the sections. Slowly learning how to approach each area until I've overcome it and can make it to the next stage.

Voice lines: currently very repetitive. There are maybe 2 lines for each attack. It makes using some attacks very old very fast.

Numbers: It would be great to have some form of hard numbers listed when approaching both skills for characters and for how much experience you stand to get from a stage. One character's skill says they sacrifice health to use the skill then heal some back. How much is healed? I know it varies based on current health and how many enemies are hit but I'd like to know that somewhere.

Rest Areas: The idea of the rest area and entropy balance is cool and I like it. The issue is sometimes you will be at 30% entropy and not see a rest area tell you are at 230% and have a whole slew of negative modifiers. I like the negative modifiers when I choose to push it but often, on hard mode, I get them just because of bad luck. Secondly the animation for healing should be part of the entropy drop animation. You start running after the drop and just wait at the wall for the healing animation to start. It's not a huge deal but it is annoying.

Practice area: The game DESPERATELY needs a practice area. Some combos are tricky to pull off and don't activate if they don't hit an enemy. There is no way to come to grips with them outside of combat. Combat isn't super stressful but it's annoying to have to worry about wasted hits when trying out the combo your potential unlocked. Plus with the mind trials if you don't remember the upgrades you had going back and trying to remember the play style needed in the middle of the fight is awkward.

Tactics: the tactics feel interesting and fun for the most part. My main issue is most are hard to tell they are doing anything in the heat of the moment. Additionally, when I'm doing a cold build, or a fire build, or whatever build I feel no difference in the approach taken when fighting. They are just something nice that increases damage. I would love to see some changes so it really FEELS different depending on the tactics you get/take.

Same feeling biomes: Each area never really feels any different other then background images. The art is pretty but navigation is identical for each of them other then the final area. The game desperately needs something to change the feeling of play when in each area. It would also be interesting to have either some choice in which you go to and what upgrades are there, or, more changes in what you gain the further into the run you go.

Echos: Using the previous runs upgrades and their skills in your next run is a great idea and mostly works. There should be a limit on how many times each echo can be taken though. When you max out the ones you can have most of the time it just feels like I'm randomly removing them since there are so many and I usually only have 1 or 2 that I use since the saved tactic was a good one. There needs to be a way they either run out of uses or they are automatically overwritten if say you do more then 3 runs with the same character so you don't spam the same ones over and over again.

That's about it for now. Again, the game is fun. The combat feels cool, I love the potentials (I still wish we could reroll them occasionally). It's just held back by the bare bones nature of it's early access. I'm excited to see what changes they make moving forward.",1695394257,1695394257,True,5,0,0.58024752140045166,0,True,False,True

Dude these bosses absolute suck! why are half of the fodder enemies harder than them? only the last boss is even kinda hard. The butterfly girl and Floating mind are just sitting around waiting for their long ass attack to finish, before you can finally punish. and we will get to the tentacle guy, oh i got some shit to say about that.

Floating mind has a 20 second attack where you just stand under a platform, scratching your dick, waiting for ALMOST HALF A MINUTE just to hit it a few times, and after it lets you hit it, it heals some. So its TRULY just a test of patients. if i wanted that i would watch paint dry.
But that isnt even the worst boss. 

The worst boss is this dumb little purple tentacle monster that just floats off screen and summons one or 2 minions at a time.......... EVERY ""Survive for 45 seconds"" MISSION IS 1,000,000x HARDER THAN THAT! AND THOSE ARE PRETTY EASY! i cant even be bothered to look up its name because frankly. it is THE WORST, MOST BORING, LAZY, UNINSPIRED BOSS I HAVE EVER SEEN! and ima terminally online no life gamer, my steam library has hundreds of games on it. and im not exaggerating when i say, that is the worst boss in ANY video game ive ever played. Vampire survivors has more interactive bosses than that stain on this game!

While the other bosses are ok, they do feel really easy in all honesty. I will say, the last boss is pretty cool! dont wanna spoil much but he is actually challenging. He does however have one really bull shit move in phase two where he INSTANTLY just does a big burst of damage in a massive 360 around him (and i mean over half the screen btw). That one move makes the boss feel pretty cheap, i think my second attempt on him, thats what i died too and i almost just uninstalled the game. the boss was so cool but then just had to throw a gimmick at me. A pretty shitty and lame one at that. 

Strait up, remove that attack, just completely remove the tentacle guy and the floating mind bosses. (dont even bother reworking them, just throw that shit in the trash where it belongs lol) and you may have rouge-lite of the next couple years right here!

As the game is, for me 7/10

Luckily you have a chance to run into a better boss when you would encounter the tentacle guy, and its stage one, so if you get the stage he comes with, you can just restart. BUT YOU NEED TO KILL THE FLOATING MIND IN EVERY RUN! and that shit got old half way thru my first attempt at him. almost wanna say 6/10 because hes that boring and tedious. he does give a whole new meaning to ""mind training"" tho.

Using as a cute little robo avatar you'll meet other people, there is also some kind of an anomaly in the system known as Phenomenon Fragments.

The combat in this game is very solid, a roguelike / roguelite with currently 8 Characters, every character have their own playstyle and potential synergies, 8 tactics or elemental to choose from (fire, frost, lighting, etc) 3 different mode easy, normal, hard. In Hard mode bosses will have more mechanics while also adding new boss. when you finished / die with character you can inherit their synergies / skills depending on their rank to other characters. Also there is Challenge mode some sort of boss fight only.

The only downside to me is the Floating Mind boss, 3rd phase the boss started to clone itself spamming laser and blue energy all over the arena while we wait under the bridge and it can heal too when it stopped spamming, pretty much wait and attack type of strategy and not to mention it can be a long fight, playing multiple run and it started to get annoying the other bosses however are pretty much solid and fun to fight(The Eye boss need more faster when changing mechanic however).

 Overwhelming replayability in a good way.  Most enjoyable roguelike/roguelite I've tried and the metroidvania elements are a nice touch.  Also, the game knows when to stop, well paced and good length/difficulty balance.

Feedback for improvements:
-Ranged characters can't hit the enemy right on top of them which feels bad
-A complete metroidvania would probably be a great addition/sequel
-A little more explanation of game mechanics since they are pretty complex. (still do not know what the numbers are on the entropy buff/debuff icons)
-Some skills REALLY interfere with gameplay.  Dash into jump is a necessary mechanic for evading but once it becomes a skill it really hampers gameplay, as well as basic attack into jump.  The skills themselves are awesome, but not being able to distinguish between a jump and an attack will get you hit a lot making it preferable not to get those skills.  A simple fix might be double tapping jump to cancel the skill and jump immediately.  Or having to hold DASH or Basic Attack while pressing jump to use the skills, rather than releasing and pressing jump which would just allow for regular jumps.
-Something seems to change the timing for the telegraphs when fighting enemies and bosses.  This might be intentional, but, for me, it was a bit frustrating and forced me to react to actual swings and movement rather than react to the telegraph.  That leads to a lot of just running really far away which is not as fun.

Let's dive right into the exceptional aspects of this game. First and foremost, the character design and particle effects are absolutely stellar. Every character, enemy, and creature you encounter is a testament to the developers' creativity and attention to detail. The way they move, interact, and even battle is a visual delight, making the game a true feast for the eyes.

Speaking of visuals, the art and graphics in this game are unquestionably top-notch. The level of detail and craftsmanship on display is a testament to the dedication of the development team. The world they've created is a breathtaking canvas of colors and atmospheres that never cease to amaze. Every screen is a masterpiece, and it's evident that a lot of heart and soul went into crafting this captivating universe.

Now, let's shift gears and talk about the gameplay. This game, despite my initial reservations about 2D scrollers, has managed to keep me hooked from start to finish. It excels in delivering a seamless and engaging experience. The controls are precise and intuitive, making it a breeze to navigate the beautifully designed world. It's a game that feels tailor-made to be a joy to play.

However, what truly sets this game apart is its laser focus on visuals. While it may not delve deep into secrets, challenges, or puzzles, it doesn't need to. The visual spectacle and character design are enough to keep players mesmerized and motivated to progress through the game. It's a bold approach that pays off exceptionally well.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who appreciates stunning character design and jaw-dropping particle effects. While it may not cater to fans of intricate secrets, challenges, or puzzles, it excels in what it sets out to do: provide a visually stunning and highly enjoyable gaming experience. My rating for this game remains a resounding 10/10, a testament to its mastery in the realm of visual artistry and character design.

This isn't really a BlazBlue game. It is a different universe with Blazblue characters being the playable characters.

The Blazblue characters, as far as I have seen, have no real development in the story.

For a game in early access, there's a generous roster to pick from like Ragna, Hakumen, Mai, ^No. 11, Kokonoe, Noel, and Hibiki. All of the characters have a different play-style(past just spamming skills and attacks) and varying health pools. Hibiki specializes in swift movements with his blink and glaive skill. Hakumen specializes in a more defensive role especially backed by his skill that blocks damage from the front and counters with a strong hit. Ragna uses his speed and attack power to make hasty and agile hits and skill is lacking in my opinion. His skill relies too heavily on his health. He uses his health to hurt enemies and in return gets less than what he lost initially. Combined with the smallest health pool in the game makes him the weakest character in the game so far. His skill makes him almost not worth the prototype token (Explained Later). Kokonoe uses barrages of missiles and debris to harm multiple enemies and blows things up. Noel uses her specialized guns in a closer approach. Dealing good damage. ^No. 11 uses her body(?) to fire low damage, but fast hitting blades that, when added up, deals pretty decent damage as well as being able to heal some health back from the damage she takes. Mai uses a spear she can throw and create a damaging gale that spins around her to keep enemies away. All of the characters have (mostly) great sets of skills and abilities. Each characters style can be added onto with ""potential"" which is just character exclusive skills that will add extra effects and damage. Some potentials are universal like having 3 dashes or 3 jumps, but each one allows you to do more damage in a certain way (More basic attack damage, skill damage, airborne damage, and dash attack). Every run through is a chance to improve on the last attempt made. Having multiple characters allows players to use Evotypes which can be used to turn the tables some. Allowing the player to have 2 skills that they can use from one character each (1 skill/1 character for a total of 2 skills). Each of these skills do not change when using a different character. They are static, but nonetheless helpful. However in picking any two characters, you can also get abilities that will help you. Like ^No. 11 allows the player to use her ability of healing back some of the damage taken. As you play you will be able to earn these characters from AMCs (ACE Mind Challenge). The main game is played through what's called mind training. Letting the player go through the game normally. As the player goes on and fails time and time again they will develop stronger Evotypes. Evotypes will have more abilities the higher you score with them. So far the highest rating I've been able to get is 1035 which is done by getting close to the end of the runs or completing a run. The first few runs will likely be around 200 or if you get a good run, possibly shy of 300. The game will soon open up AMCs which is a strengthened boss battle. The Evotypes you create from your runs will be able to be used there and will only be able to be used once, and if you die, you have to use a new Evotype. Evotypes are compiled ranking of a play through and higher score means more abilities with each type, although you cannot improve one, you can develop more, although the abilities you get with them, again do not change for other characters. If you manage to complete the AMC you are rewarded with AP (money) and a protoype token. There are three rounds so far in AMC each with a test that comes before the main challenge. These are a sort of benchmark and allows the player to progress in the story that feels a bit lacking right now, and show how much stronger your characters are getting. For your first prototype token spent, I would not recommend Ragna unless you want a challenge. If you're new to this game I would recommend Hakumen as he has the largest health pool of all the characters and has great attack damage. All in all though this game is good and decently priced knowing there will be more content and fixes in future.

This is where some of my issues come up with the game. (There will be no spoilers)

The story isn't bad and is mildly interesting, but it has no connection to the IP it is supposed to be a apart of. You merely play the characters from Blazblue. Its okay for now, but with how little of the story there is, there's not much to know about it or why Blazblue is connected. Another problem is localization. The translation is mostly good, having few errors in English, but with 95% of the voice overs being Chinese. The only thing that isn't in Chinese are the character's voice lines (Battle chatter that is also in Japanese) and when the game boots up or announces a new evotype. There are however subtitles, but only if its the dialogue in the story. It's fine, but in my opinion makes the story less interesting to follow. Similar to how some people can't watch Anime in Dubbed. 

The game play is very smooth although there are some issues with responsiveness for the controls, I have had a few times (maybe 5 times) where I have taken unnecessary hits because I couldn't dash at despite having an open window to.
 The Sortitio is a great way to take a chance, but the 'better luck next time reward' leaves you completely empty handed, while that is its purpose and its fine being in the game, I feel as I though I get it far too often, on one of my runs, I got four in a single run, which can make or break in some cases given how good the rewards can be, but none of the tiles have any entropy (random debuffing/chaos system) reducing effects. 
Ragna is good on paper and has some good potentials and abilities with a great playstyle, but I feel like his ability to become as good as some of the characters is his lack of return on investment. With how little damage his AoE skill deals, I don't feel like the loss of health is justified. Most often you won't get back the health you spent if at all. Although, it can be minorly countered with ^No. 11's health returning ability. Even with this, Ragna will have the shortest runs and will likely die more quickly, especially with his healthpool not even breaking 2000 when the HP stat is maxed out. Most hits to the player will deal about 70 at the lowest to 600 at the most and that's without debuffs. With the exhaustion debuff, which increases all damage to the player by 50%, Ragna is just barely 3 shot by the strongest of attacks. I feel like Ragna got the short end of the stick and from the other games I do actually like Ragna, so it upsets me with how much I feel like he got the short end of the stick.

(9/1/23) This is an additional edit and alteration. 

As of writing this, there is a bug that currently doesn't let me finish my run after dying/failing. I have just finished a run with a newly released character that shown in the trailer, but is now playable. I just finished my run and the game won't return me to the ACE center. Instead a large blank wall appears not reacting to my character, with the evotype announced and there's no button to interact with (F) it, or its just not working. I tried continued to the right of the screen and after a few seconds, it takes me to a black area, no lights or anything, and the robot you play as outside of the simulations just falls endlessly. The only fix I have for this is to quit out the game completely as the pause menu WILL NOT appear after your run.",1692569835,1693576716,True,1,0,0.508518993854522705,2,True,False,True

The thing people should know is the game is not set in the BlazBlue universe but rather a completely different world an scenario for example when you start the game you play a floating robot that goes through some dialogue with other beings in the hub world. When most of the dialogue is over you move to the right of the screen to enter in the simulation turning into and using the powers / abilities of the BlazBlue fighters in a roguelike action game.

Which is to say, only by the thinnest of technicalities. Perhaps there's some connection hidden deep within the incredibly cryptic plot, but to be two hours in and not have any acknowledgment that the Blazblue setting even exists is... concerning, to say the least. Perhaps there's a connection somewhere deep in the cryptic storyline these devs are weaving. Perhaps 91Act just licensed the IP for some easy sprites and some brand recognition. I'd like to believe the former, but considering the lack of any reference to the source and that you start with Hibiki over long-time series staple Ragna, I'm not particularly confident in that assessment.

That being said, on every other account? This game is a masterpiece. Visuals are utterly gorgeous, blending 3D models and beautiful pixel art into a seamless display of science-fantasy beauty. Combat is more frantic Dead Cells hack-and-slash than deliberate combo-based fighter at first glance, but the Potential system expands your moveset exponentially with each one you find, quickly turning simple bread-and-butter combos into more complex, winding strings as you find moves that link into each other and enhance the parts to make a whole. A steady influx of powerful Tactics and devilish Corruptions keeps the gameplay constantly fresh and pushes you to seek out more of what there is to offer. And the plot, while a distressingly far cry from what I expected, has enough barbs in me that I suspect I'm going to be spending a lot of time digging for those Phenomena Fragments.

If you're here for the BlazBlue, maybe wait a bit and see if 91Act actually puts the IP to good use. If you're just here for the action, though, this is an [i]easy[/i] recommendation.",1693375268,1693375268,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First off, the game just looks very good. I never imagined this neon look would work for BlazBlue, and I was surprised at how well this actually fits the characters. While the graphics are above average compared to other games in the genre, the special effects are sometimes a bit too much to look at. With its usage of bloom, screen shake and bright neon colors, it's sometimes hard to keep track of your character, and if you're sensitive to this stuff, this might be a deal breaker for you. Some of these effects like the bloom can be disabled, but more accessibility options would be nice in future updates.
I personally don't think it's that much of an issue, but I know it might be for other people.

The story so far is slow and cryptic, and is only loosely connected to the BlazBlue universe as far as I can tell for now. But since it is not finished yet, we'll have to wait and see where the story takes us next. Unfortunately the BlazBlue characters don't actually take part in the story, so if you were looking forward to seeing these characters interact with each other, you'll be disappointed. Right now the gameplay is definitely the star of the show, and what a star it is!

True to BlazBlue, all the playable characters feel very different from each other and have their own unique playstyles. While the Tactics dubbed upgrades are not all that impressive, the Potential upgrades really make this game feel special. These unlock special moves, which you can string together with your other attacks to form stylish combos.
Compared to fighting games, the commands for these move are much simpler, but getting to grips with what you can do with which character at every given moment takes practice. Luckily, the controls are very responsive and merely moving around feels great. Pulling off combos feels awesome and stringing all these moves together with your mobility creates a really nice flow.

All in all the game is really fun in its current state and I'm already hyped for future updates. Although its only loosely connected to the main series, just seeing the BlazBlue IP being put to good use already means a lot to me and I hope this won't be the last time we hear of this franchise.

The counter character and the characters with iframe dashes are by far the most viable, in my opinion, which makes the game a little unbalanced.

But as its own game I enjoy it, it's a solid action-y roguelike and if you like those or want something else to play BB chars in I think it's reasonable. The only caveat in my experience aside from being EA itself is that sometimes I'll get performance issues on my PC that make things run less smooth than it feels like they should.

It's still playable though and at least worth consideration. I would argue if you're into roguelikes, or just want something with at least a little bit of blazblue, I'd pick it up when you have money to spare and aren't busy with other games. It's very much worth the price at $20, stands among its peers in regards to fast combat roguelikes and is a solid game worth keeping an eye on.

You play as a robot playing a combat simulation using fighting game characters from some franchise...its not that important to the game. The combat combos and different character's movesets make each run fun and pretty different. You play the roguelike mode so that you can use the builds you made there to challenge a boss mode and earn rewards and unlock new characters. The boss fights can be pretty tough, especially before you get some unlocks. A fun rogue thats smooth and fluid and has decent meta progression. I look forward to seeing how they move the game forward. It is definitely early access and has some optimization issues and can stutter sometimes, but I've never had it stutter during the combat mode, just when moving around the base hub.

Edit: Last fight before the omega stage, especially on the advanced mode is just simply not fun. In my experience Sortitio rooms become pointless on the advanced difficulty as well because the potential of ""Better luck next time"" or a negative effect seem much more likely than anything positive, so almost any other room becomes a better option than risking the corruption for either nothing or a very damaging negative. So far i see no incentive to play on the advanced mode because it only adds things that take away from the fun. the problem i find with most games these days is a lack of understanding that difficulty and challenge are not the same thing.",1692776691,1692997106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Rather than pitting them against a single adversary, they engage with multiple foes in a roguelite fashion. However, a significant drawback is that these roguelite elements are confined to small rooms where combat against enemies takes place, followed by the selection of buffs. The exploratory aspect found in games like Dead Cells is lacking, with the exception of a single area providing a Metroidvania-inspired map.

The narrative fails to stand out, as it veers away from the BlazBlue universe. Instead, the storyline revolves around Ace, a robot who receives communication from Stan, a hacking robot. Personally, neither of these characters resonates with me, leading me to often skip through the dialogue. In the role of Ace, one engages in simulations that enable the player to assume the roles of a limited set of BlazBlue characters. Though the character roster is currently modest, it is expected to expand considerably in time, a trend commonly seen in early access games.

Overall, while some might view it as a mere attempt to capitalize on the franchise, I believe it serves as a promising beginning for those seeking the opportunity to embody their cherished BlazBlue characters within a roguelike framework.",1692927762,1692927762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

None of which quite compare to BB:EE. 
So, from someone who entered this game knowing full well what to expect, here are the pros and cons!

Pros:
Movement is tight.
Combat is fluid and rewarding.
The corruption system is well implemented.
The graphics are... Out of this world, as far as the genre is concerned.
Boss fights are challenging, and ""souls-like"" in their patterns. (Save for 1 boss, I'll mention later).
Enemies are highly akin to Dead Cells in their functionality, which is praise in my book.
The character selection provides a sense of ""progression"", which I'll explain further later.
Characters are quick to unlock. (Approx. 2 - 4 hours to get them all. At time of writing, Es is currently unavailable.)
Characters are extremely diverse in how they play, and each have their own unique move sets that you can unlock during runs, called ""potentials"".
God it feels good to play.

Cons:
Small selection of enemies, each stage having about 2 - 5 variations.
Small selection of stages. Currently there are 4 - 5 stages as of writing.
Some balancing issues, some characters feel stronger than others to a degree that makes them feel bad to play.
These characters are Hibiki and Mei. Without a particular setup, they're very underwhelming.

How the game plays:
Every run starts out with you as a robot, that can move around a small hubworld.
The world is mostly unable to be interacted with, outside of ""story"" progression. (I skipped all dialogue and cut scenes.)
The story has nothing to do with BlazBlue lore, as denoted by the last statement in the games description.
Heading to the right, takes you straight to the character select screen.

After selecting a character, you'll be able to select 2 assists, which provide you with one of their skills each. These assists will also provide their 2 passive bonuses, as well as one of the traits you unlocked on their runs. This can range from small insignificant bonuses, to outright making the character overpowered. (Please note, these bonuses are given at the end of any run you complete with a score of 800+. The granted bonuses are random from the list that you acquired throughout your run.)

You'll then be thrown into one of the starting 2 stages. The end of each stage leads to  a boss.
After completing each ""level"" within the stages, you'll be granted access to a selection room.
Training (combat), Potential, Exchange, Rest, ""Random"", and a harder difficulty of training are offered.

Potentials unlock character skills. These expand character movesets, and are unique to each character.
Random can vary between -10 HP, to things like +130 money, or unlocking a new potential.
Exchange brings up a shop, with varying outcomes you can spend your funds on. Reduced corruption, new trait, etc.
Rest will remove negative modifiers, acquired from built up corruption. (50% - 100% corruption reduction, as well as removing 0-3 negative effects)

Corruption is a mechanic that forces your hand in some situations.
At the start of every stage, you gain corruption. This is shown in the upper right hand corner. After 100%, you start to get negatives. Every %>100 will give you that %'s chance of obtaining a negative effect. (120% = 20% chance.) These all provide a challenge, and randomly change what they will be after every stage. After 200% corruption, your time per level deteriorates. 200% - 300% = 1 - 100% time reduction. Normally the timer will not play a factor, however after 200% you'll definitely start to notice it.

The potential corruptions offered, as well as the % chance is displayed prior to entering a new area. (This allows you to determine if you wanna rest, or keep pushing your luck. You may not get to rest next stop.)
Perfectly Implemented IMO.

Once you reach the end, you get to fight one of the bosses. Of which's names, I cannot remember for the life of me.
Floating Eye, Sand Serpent, Arakune, Robot...boi?, Elevator woman, Double Robots, and Susanoo are all decently made boss fights, with varying mechanics across them.
Then there's the butterfly woman. Man, I could write a whole review on how much I hate this fight. But it's mandatory after stage 3. Take it or leave it, it will certainly test your patience in hard mode.
If you picked Hakumen, you best pray you took the ""Invulnerable while dashing"" potential. Unlike with other characters, his is the only one that does damage, and is vulnerable.

After you've completed the run, win or lose, you will get a score. Their are breakpoints for character unlocks. If you don't reach a certain point score on the run, you will not receive passives or a trait buff from the character you completed with.

In traditional rogue like fashion, rinse-and-repeat.


TLDR:
The game is fluid. The mechanics are challenging. The characters are familiar. Their movesets are all varied. The runs are highly customizable. I bought this game when there were no reviews, on a whim because I saw blazblue. I read it was a rogue like. I was not disappointed.

Hades, Wizards of Legend, Rogue's Legacy, Dead Cells among a slew of other rogue likes; could not hold a candle to this game.
Because the combat here is good. The combos exist. The combos feel good to execute.

The game.
Is.
Fun.

That being said this game is just fucking sick. Plays like those youtube fan-made animations of taking random game sprites and making them fight but also making it work. Rougelike elements are also a nice blend of choices that vary from what kind of new moves you want, completely new effects to add to moves, or passive buffs. It's a bit awkward to control with some characters later since you get so many moves and there is only 2 attack buttons, so the game really makes you work them with different inputs and combinations with other buttons that aren't for attacking. It leaves the movesets just a little bloated especially with characters like Noel, who has attacks that happen after you jump or dodge meaning if you are in the middle of attacking and you want to actually dodge, you might just fly into a projectile or attack and get your shit clocked.
Game is still in early access so these are subject to change but I swear to fucking god if this game doesn't add Valkenhayn R. Hellsing, Yuuki Terumi, Litchi and Azrael I will wreak havoc.

Combat feels super fluid and every character still feels unique from both mainline BB and each other, while still retaining a surprising amount of identity from Blazblue. The evotype system is also really fun and interesting, and I appreciate the entropy system giving you the option to ramp up the challenge of each run in real time.

I think my only gripes with the game so far really just come down to 1.) the lack of explanation on how certain systems work 2.) some odd translation issues that make certain points in the story a bit difficult to follow in English, but that's honestly a non-issue in the grand scheme of things.

With how polished most of the core gameplay feels for an early access title, I'm excited to see how the team expands on what is already a SUPER solid concept! :-)

Do some research before you impulse buy!!![/b]

with that out of the way, on release, this game is really good, and honestly stands out from the rest of my library. it's a *REALLY* fun time with some pretty prevalent issues, but overall, problems like those are to be expected with a EA release. The game blew my expectations out of the water, If it catches your eye I really do think you should give it a try.

The general gameplay loop is very well made. It's a mix of dead cells and hades, but does it extremely well.
this game's combat is probably one of my favorite combat systems, It just flows so well with itself with all the moves you can use, especially once you get a few more with a few potentials. when runs hit that point, it really does feel like my favorite combat system ever, honestly. being able to string together so many moves into combos, and being able to wail on a knocked down enemy is extremely satisfying and engaging. Each character is nice and unique. even those that aren't in base moveset, their unique upgrades really make them significantly different from each other the further you get in a run. (I've tried them all except kokonoe, but ragna's my favorite, he is absolutely insane)

This game is also visually stunning. The work on the environments, enemies, and especially the lighting are extremely well done, making the game overall extremely nice to look at! the character sprites are ripped from central fiction, but their particles, attack effects, and lighting have made them still blend in.

But some issues do exist. in my current playtime, I can see some balance issues. my runs are usually very easy until the very end, where I hit a difficulty wall. haven't even gotten to the final boss yet, the one right before it kills me every time, even with max hp refills. the bosses are really big difficulty spikes in runs. Regular combat encounters aren't that difficult for me, and don't give that many rewards, so I end up eventually skipping them when possible once I've done a couple in the area. the combat system keeps them engaging, though!

given the game could fix these issues throughout early access, i'm optimistic that this game could become a *really, really good roguelike.* it's really fun beat em' up combat that gets more engaging the further I get in a run. even with it's couple of difficulty issues, If the gameplay looks enjoyable to you, this game will probably be worth your time.

You can pretty much ignore this game's vague plot unfortunately, but the gameplay is responsive and solid. This game is an action rougelike where the way you fight enemies from the start of your run compared to the end is vastly different due to the new movesets you unlock along the way. Took me about 12 hours to beat the game on advance/hard mode with every character.

Overall game is solid if you're a fan of the genre, I might recommend other games if you're not really looking for another rougelike due to having played all the other ones.

 I beated Susanoo a few times on normal mode and touched a little bit advanced training mode. This game is good and i think i'm getting more addicted the more i play it. This is early acess so there is some problems, bugs and lack of some content, but there is enough content to enjoy game and roguelike part of it. Every character and their playstyles (potential upgrades) feels unique. Every character have unique pace, playstyles (Skill upgades), strengths, weaknesses and even some bullshit blazing. I like how game incetivise you play more and on a different characters with legacy upgrades. Legacy upgrades and evotypes is cool mechanic and i hope we see more playable content with it, like bossrush on evo type or more legacy ungrades and etc. Potentials (skill upgrade system in a run) is a good mechanic and make every run feel unique, potentials even have synnergies and your attacks may differ because you've got different potential in a run.

 But yeah this cool and all, but there is ofcourse some minuses. First is tactics, it's a good mechanic, but sometimes it feels like it's doing nothing, but problem is not in damage, problem is how most of tactics feels when you bring them, because most of the time you take your tactic from level up and say ""ok another grey ice tactic"", and it kinda sucks that something that can make your run much easier and make some builds much better feels like nothing most of the time. I hope in a future we get quality over quantity in tactics, because some tactics are really fun like dagger tactics. Second is some survival rooms, i can't strees enough how cancerous some survival rooms, not only you get spamed by enemies and with enemies, they also get fat shields so you couldn't kill some of them fast enough. Sometimes it's even impossible to avoid any damage and you lose 30% of your HP in a little bullet/attack-hell room, so i hope in a future you will get rewarded with some HP after survival room. And third, i think it's just an early access problem, but there is lack of important explanation, like potential synergies and where you can look at them, because its a very low chance that you press ""esc"" and character details to see what is potential synergies and you can't see legacy tactics in combat UI, you get these tactics but you can only see them in charcter details and your evo type that you use for ""ace mind challenge"" can get HP mixtures for boss battle depending on how many mixtures was at moment of death.

I know it's obvious to see from the screenshots on the store page, but this is a different kind of game, and one that has no connection to Blazblue outside of the characters just existing in this world. The characters exist only as a move sets to use in something that I would describe as similar to Dead Cells.

But with that in mind, this is an incredibly pleasant surprise, there is not a TON of content on offer at the moment as it's still in Early Access but what is there is really polished and I genuinely hope more gets added over time because it's a lot of fun to take these characters and ""break them free"" of the confines of a 1 on 1 fighting game stage, and letting them take part in platforming combat.

The combat is not as in depth as Blazblue (or even BBTag), everything is full of auto-combos and singular button combinations to do flashy moves, and while that would be awful for a fighting game, it actually lends itself really well for a platformer similar to Dead Cells.

Highly recommend because while it's not Blazblue, it's still a very pleasant surprise of a game.

Believe the company that did this game has done previous mobile BB spinoffs in China too so they know their BB pretty well and it shows in the way characters move and play as well as how nutty some of the upgrade combos can get. Some cute trophy references too. For an early release game it has a LOT of polish and they are putting out updates for things like fixes and other additions rather fast (with audio for Eng and JP coming soon apparently, Eng already has system voices compared to a few days ago when it was all Chinese audio). Looking forward to having more stuff and characters added as well as hopefully even more ways to play with the characters we already have.

Hoping my boy Hazama becomes playable eventually but even if not I'll still be playing this a long long time.

If no, then it would be dishonoring an old franchise that I'm fond of, and lazily rehashing old assets to spare a few bucks.
Well, I'm sure as you can imagine looking at my recommendation, I honestly enjoy the mechanics and fundamentals of the game. The combat is kinetic and satisfying, the rougelite system makes for fun run-building, and the way the runs pay off by making for easier bossfight challenges later is a cool way to make repeated playthroughs feel worth it. The BlazBlue characters making a comeback, their actual record-setting visual assets getting some more love, and integrating the fighting-style mechanics into platformer gameplay is just all just gravy on top.",1692479710,1692479710,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Short version:

Pros
- Hack 'n slash roguelike
- Blazblue characters
- Has great visual style
- Has Kokonoe
- Not stupid expensive 
- Easy to learn, hard to master

Cons: 
- Tree of Origin
- Sakura City
- Shield generator enemies
- Combo strings work in mysterious ways
- Sortitio rates and rewards
- Exchange costs and options
- Traps that deal absurd amount of damage
- Hitboxes are pretty bad

Despite being somewhat lackluster in a current state, I strongly recommend this game. Huge fan of Blazblue games and lore. An easy buy. Not much content from what is there at the moment, but more characters and stages are to be added later. Also please add Nine. If I can recommend this game in a current state, then it only gets better from there, I'm sure.

The long read is beyond this point, you've been warned.

It is a recommend from me but with a huge IF. Also, for the people who keep yapping about ""this isn't Blazblue"", the game deviates from the usual fighting game genre because both developer and publisher are completely different. Also, the plot of mainline game doesn't bother you, but a plot involving dubious organizations and simulated copies of Blazblue characters inside of said game somehow makes this ""not Blazblue"". Yeah, right.
This game certainly lacks polish. 
Some characters are more certainly more viable than others. Visually it is stunning, but when playing some characters, the feedback from their hits is pretty lackluster. 
Odd complaint for a roguelike game, but it relies on the roguelike system too much while most of the characters just can't sustain themselves properly. Make viable builds much more accessible, I'm begging you, because in order to have a viable build you have to get lucky on the stage progression, otherwise you get Tree of Origin and on most characters you can just bid farewell to your run once that is the case. Characters NEED TO BE BUFFED. I want to play and feel like I'm making the world revolve around me, like I am doing damage to things. I want to have base character sustainable enough for the gameplay loop to be fun and not default to just the safer choices. Sure, you can build something viable out of every character technically, and then die on the same stage as you complete your build, or just play Hakumen. That is what I did and that is how I got the successful runs on both normal and advanced modes, beating advanced mode final boss on 142 HP and having no heals left. But I want to play EVERY character and not having it feel like I'm trying to cut a tree down with a potato peeler, because maybe I'm a stupid guy, I don't know, but I feel like Hakumen is the only character who can clear this game solely because him and Ragna are the most sustainable ones (although Ragna is much more risk-reward).
It is very clear that the game gatekeeps you from progression, and while as far as first impressions go the game seems very fun, but then you reach Sakura City for the first, second, third, tenth, twentieth time... and then if you're lucky enough, you die to Elite Sample in chapter 4.
The game takes inspiration from Dead Cells in a lot of ways, and most of them are good inspirations, but paired up with this game's lack of quality of life results in a frustrating combination rather than a commendable one overall. Where Dead Cells combat and controls are tight and snappy, Blazblue tells you ""once you're in a middle of a move, you have to commit"". Doesn't sound like much, or does it? Inability to cancel out your moves at any given moment leads to 99% of frustrating moments I had with this game. Sure, I played arguably one of the slowest characters, Hakumen, but he is invincible during dash only if you take a certain upgrade (I don't know why just not have the i-frame dash be the default since every character has different move and dash speed), so without this upgrade you can't dodge out of a projectile even if you dash, and if you can tell me to just make the perfect move in every situation, tell me that I could've just jumped out of the way, I couldn't because I have to commit to one of the slowest movesets, and dash works much more instant because I imagine that is what the devs had in mind when it comes to dash usage. 
Where Dead Cells let you heal after each stage, Blazblue only gives you as many mixtures as you can get in the permanent upgrades. Arguably you can tell me that one can obtain them in the gambling lobby or exchange lobby, but those sources are unreliable, because in the first one you will simply more than likely get something else if not the infamous ""Better luck next time"" trait. Or how about a whopping 10% heal? Ah yes, thanks, now I can probably survive a single extra hit if I'm playing Hakumen and if I am playing anyone else, then it doesn't do me any favors to get ~150 HP when a boss attack can average from 200-300, and that's considering single hit attack. Sure' regular enemies do less, although Sakura City enemies that throw chasing projectiles do hit you for exactly 150 HP.  Point is, no HP mixture refill, no proper life-steal unless Ragna, no sustain. I want the game to be fun, not to sweat buckets and tryhard. 
Combos are a bit of a mixed bag. I understand for down + skill or heavy attack to be a thing, but never a down + light attack combination. It is easy, but inconvenient in heat of the combat. I honestly just forget I even got that as an upgrade. Why not just have combo potential for light attack combos be an extension of basic combo or replacement of your basic combo with a longer string instead of having to keep in your mind that you have to hold down for a different set of moves? Makes it much easier to perform and the reliability of it is extended for that exact reason. It is a more viable replacement that a player will keep in mind due to how effective it is compared to the base string, because I have not (for the most part) used the down-light extensions whenever I chose to get them, simply forgetting those exist. Yes, I'm a casual, a low-skill player or whatever, I think I am pretty stupid. But there is a difference to when complexity through progression feels artificial and when it comes to you with time. In all of my time with the current content I cleared the game using only Hakumen base combo string, i-frame dash upgrade, Hotaru (jump amidst basic combo string for upward kick), his basic signature parry stance and legacy skills. Pretty sure I have the down-light extension in my successful runs, but I swear I just didn't care to keep it in my head. Hence why I think extended strings of light attacks as a replacement or mix of light-heavy serving as extended combos would suit this game's combat much better. If you need to keep down-light, reserve it for a sweep move with potential upside of it being able to knock down enemies that have no armor status. 
As for the games visuals, I have only praise for it. Even if not unique, it is beyond decent for what is there when it comes to visual side of things. Also, the way your character reflects off of lights in different areas makes for some sick-looking moments. Animations for the attacks are very well done, just wish the sounds and the impact of attacks felt a bit more telegraphed. 
Also, once more, hitboxes are bad and the game doesn't need the stupid traps and clunky attempt at platforming. I repeat ONCE AGAIN. Dead Cells has it because it is a tight and very responsive game when it comes to controls and player agency at all times Just because Dead Cells has it, doesn't mean that you should do it. If you want to do it, work on the damn game enough so that it would feel just a good to move around in it. Otherwise you're just kneecapping this game once more.

Still, concluding with a recommendation and hope that the game will find its footing soon enough, because the current state doesn't do complete justice to what the game has in store.",1692439932,1692439932,True,1,0,0.466498434543609619,0,True,False,True

Also with the overconfident marketing claims about this being the ""pinnacle of roguelite action games"", i feel like it couldn't be much farther from the truth.

First of all the story and setting. I love roguelikes and usually these kind of games at least try to justify the gameplay loop with a fitting story. Here your main character is just this little robot running these simulations on anime girl fighters from blazblue series. That's the story. Great. I don't know if it develops any further but c'mon that's the lamest possible way to start off a game.

While the game is visually gorgeous on some ares, the world feels shallow. Also for a game based off a fighting game series, the first character you get to play hardly feels like a fighting game character. You have one basic attack and one ability. All the roguelike level up/power ups are just passives or improvements for said attack and ability. I did a couple runs and they all felt exactly the same. When you buy a roguelike game, you want to feel like every run is a little different and exciting, right? Even if you prefer a similar playstyle every time, thats the hook, right? There is none of that in here. I guess that feeling would change as you unlock new characters, but with a progression system as poor as what i experienced in my short time with this game, why even bother.

It is definitively not a BlazBlue game period and I think it's pretty important people understand that, because if you ask me the devs are misleading the consumer on purpose about it; as someone who loves BlazBlue, I gotta say someone has to be honest about it. This is a roguelike whose plot is about a sad little robot piloting a BlazBlue character in a VR sim to unlock story bits in an entirely original setting and lore. I would call this the most glorified asset flip in history, but the fact is, it's good.

The people that made this could've been completely dispassionate about ripping sprites and assets to create something that felt random and completely disconnected from the source those assets were taken from- however that is not the case. These guys clearly like BlazBlue, and know a little about it. If you're like me and feel an attachment to BlazBlue then rest assured that the design of the gameplay is conscious of the characters' origin. For example Ragna DOES drain life with his attacks, Hakumen CAN chain special moves together, and Lambda DOES steal moves from Nu. 

The combat is fluid, not without flaws, but it feels good to play. The roguelike elements tied to elemental effects and the like are boring and same-y, and frankly the game would be better without them; buuuut the other half of the upgrades are unlocking more of the character's actual moveset, and this is where the fun is. Similar to a game like Vampire Survivors, when you get moves X, and Y, they will synergize and also unlock move Z for you. Example: unlocking Ragna's Inferno Divider, plus the followups to Hell's Fang and Nightmare Edge will also add the Inferno Divider follow ups to your moveset. There are a LOT of these combinations on offer here, more than you are expecting, I promise you. 

The devs also invented a ton of their own moves for the characters with clever and good-looking use of spritework, and these are great in context. Some of it is not faithful to the character's origin (Noel does not actually shoot bullets, and Kokonoe doesn't spam missiles) but again, in context for a 2D PvE game, it's all good stuff, and fits well enough. Props to the devs for including accurate names of moves with what I'd call 90% accuracy, the references are mostly on point. Again, they could've done a lot worse at this if they didn't actually care. I believe that they do.

Music and aesthetic are where I don't think they cared at all to make a BlazBlue game. None of it is bad, but it is just straight up not BlazBlue and frankly as a fan it is a little offensive. Low-fi electronic beats is the most not-BlazBlue thing you could put in your game that has BlazBlue in the title. Big mistake. 

What I want out of this game is more modes, and especially a free training mode that'll let me fight dummies and do combos with the skill builds I want to play for fun. A lot of time by the time I get my fun build completed my character is so strong that I one shot enemies and don't even get to use the fun stuff. Ragna's my favorite character in fiction so I'm not here to ask for anyone else. I hope your favorite gets added.

Maybe have a tumber tick down above your characters head or on the UI itself? Anything is better than what it is now

The only other aspect I can immediately criticize right now, is that it can do a better job visually communicate when you're low on health, maybe do what Marvels Spider-Man did, where the outline of the screen is red, and the UI glitches (extra fitting when you consider this is a digital simulation in ACE's system)

Over all though, just play this game.

There are many upgrades in the game that let you juggle and combo enemies and all the character movesets are very smiliar or inspired by their Blazblue counterparts.
Yeah the story is weird and confusing, but so is Blazblue's

Apart from that the game is an insanely satisfying and fun roguelike. It's very fast and feels good to control and is fairly challenging as well.

[u] This review concerns the Early Access version of Blazblue Entropy Effect [/u]

Published by arcystemworks and developed by the indie Chinese studio 91Act, Blazblue Entropy Effect is a fundamentally different game from what the license has offered so far. Here you will have the opportunity to play several characters from the franchise in a roguelite with a dystopian scenario and detached from the blazblue universe.

[b] What can we learn from this first experience? A polished, nervous and addictive gameplay. [/b]

Take control of one Blazblue character and unlock moves, make your own build, call on the other characters you have played, persevere, try again...
The level design is great, the game is beautiful, the music is not composed by Daisuke Ishiwatari some might be upset by that but in this game they decided to go for a different tone and they succeeded in it. Although the story is detached from the blazblue universe it is charming. 
The absence of Japanese and English dubbing is quite disturbing and I can only wish that this will be added in the future although I appreciate enjoying a game dubbed in Chinese but I understand that it does not necessarily please.

It is through this modest review that I dare to hope that more people will be interested in this game which clearly deserves it. For my part I will encourage the developers as well as arcsystem on their way, won over, by this title

The biggest game changing mechanic from my point of view has to be the potentials for each character.

Potentials are so far the best part about the game and elevates the gameplay of each character in a unique way. Not only does it allow characters access to more moves that can change and add to their moveset, they can have synergy with one another to provide additional benefits(such as adding invincibility in Mai's dash attack). It has become the most fun part of the game for me to discover what I like as I try to get high scores with characters, and then bring them to the Kirby style Colosseum after I finish/lose my run.

THE GOOD

My past experience with rogue-lites include Dead Cells; and I am VERY fond of that game. Dead Cells looks amazing visually, is very smooth in every aspect including gameplay and music, and I love everything about it.

Blazblue Entropy Effect scratches that itch of having something different but not too far off the mold of Dead Cells. You play as the characters from Blazblue, and as you move on, you unlock more and more of their moves as well as generic buffs and abilities like Spinning Blades and Summons.

The gameplay loop is pretty good; I feel frustrated when I die, but you know you'll come back stronger the next time as in any rogue-lite. Consistent, and I enjoy how I can combine the abilities of other characters I have unlocked with my main character that I'm playing as. The SFX are great, I enjoy beating up small mobs and bosses are fun-frustrating. They did NOT screw up the gameplay-loop and I enjoy it very much. This ALONE is a very good reason to buy the game.

The Graphics are very much deserving of it's own segment. The shadows, lighting, and everything for this game are gorgeous. Despite using Blazblue's sprites, they payed a lot of attention to detail on the lighting aspects and making them look STUNNING. Hakumen's Armor and Ragna's Clothes shine in the night, and I feel so cool when playing as them.

Now, scratch for a few things, there are SOME problems. Despite my volume being at 10%, Blazblue Entropy Effect absolutely KILLS my ears everytime I die, seemingly ignoring the fact I changed the volume settings. This occurs during two random times; when I die, and when I face off against that giant eye monster in the abyss and it's roar. This gets a pass though, cause this game is still in Early Access. Fix it for the main release, and were good.

Also, this might be the nature of the game, but I wish there was a run-button. There's a dash-button but it's moreso there for dodging and cancelling your attacks. Hakumen is INCREDIBLY slow and can only walk with his little shimmy. I'm aware that Hakumen himself lacks a run-sprite in the Blazblue games, but the developers did very well in making all the characters have these neat new functions and effects not present in the main games. Make Hakumen a shining-shadow as he runs, I dunno. Give it to everyone. This is moreso a nitpick though, and does not effect my rating on the game.

-

THE BAD

Now for the actual problems. Blazblue Entropy Effect... is a rogue-lite claiming itself as a Blazblue game, while not having anything to do with Blazblue. The characters you play as; they are certainly the characters from the games, and they DO have fitting moves besides maybe Hibiki with his shuriken skill. But that is the full extent of where Blazblue is included, as far as I know.

I am 3.5 Hrs into the game, and I am introduced to all this jargon about ACE and the company your Avatar seemingly works for. You get more of these weird memories as you progress, while also interacting above in the overworld with some random bots about a lot of random things. I am not understating when I say ""random"", you help a person because they're sad, and you don't know why. You won't KNOW why, until like 3 or 4 talks later. You do not feel anymore invested in the meanwhile; you're basically being railroaded because EVERYONE is mysterious and you don't figure anything out. I am still in the dark about why I should be so suspicious of ACE, the game my Avatar is playing, and who to trust between the giant floating white particle thing in my basement, my walky talky partner friend, or this random maybe-probably-insane man I met upon the surface telling me everything I know is a lie. The game's plot isn't actually that confusing... but moreso frustrating. Blazblue's plot is already that, but at least the jargon is accompanied by characters I love.

And that in itself is another problem. Besides the characters being in this ""game"" your avatar plays, they serve no other purpose to this game. I should re-illustrate: I am 3.5 Hrs into a Blazblue Game, and there is no Blazblue.

People play Fighting Games for a variety of reasons. Plots are very confusing, and might not be the first thing you mention. But Entropy Effect is devoid of both the characters in soul and in plot. They do not interact with each other, they don't make any quirky one liners at the bosses. They do not play a role in the main story. They do not do anything besides be your way of kicking butt.

...Again, this is the same in fighting games, if you're solely playing for the gameplay. But Blazblue's cast is CHOCK full of personality just by existing. Ragna against Terumi by their intro alone reeks of story. Their inclusion in this rogue-lite is bland and tasteless besides the mechanics.

Blazblue Entropy Effect honestly seems like a game that could stand on it's own, but last minute, got forced to include Blazblue Characters. Everything in it could function fine without them, including the Arakune Boss. I feel a little ripped off that I would get to see Ragna again after so long, after years of no Blazblue AT ALL, but he doesn't even say anything besides his generic fighting grunts when running through the game. The Blazblue characters are NOT in the spotlight despite what this game is telling you.

TLDR & OVERALL

Rant aside, this game is still very much good. The gameplay loop is great, the graphics are DROP DEAD GORGEOUS for a rogue-lite of this calliber, and I love the shading behind it too. SFX and Music is nice, and I enjoy it a lot. It's very good, and very satisfying to run through. However, when deciding to get this game, please do note that you're playing a game that's a Rogue-lite with Blazblue Characters, not a Blazblue Rogue-Lite. I will likely still play this game, but not as much as I would have wanted if the game actually revolved around the characters of Blazblue.

I recommend this for players looking for a good rogue-lite, and are interested due to either the characters of Blazblue being playable, the unique aesthetic of the game, or for it's great graphics. These aspects do not disappoint, and are gorgeous.

I do not recommend this game for Blazblue fans looking for more Blazblue content, or anything consisting of story, lore, or character development for the Blazblue World. If you, however, are still looking for a Rogue-lite, I can still safely recommend this game for you as long as you're not looking for anything deeper than the characters just being there. It is still very much a fun game!",1692257773,1692257773,False,11,3,0.508080422878265381,1,True,False,True

It’s similar to Dead Cells but with more fluid and combo heavy gameplay. If you’re a fan of rouge-lites and metroidvanias give it a shot, it’s worth the price point.

Alright so let's get one thing straight since I see so many people bring it up, aside from the playable characters this game has nothing to do with Blazblue and that's fine because it was never advertised as such.

With that out of the way let's get on with the pros and cons:

Pros:
- Gameplay is super fun and fluid and varies a lot between characters
- The buffs you can get within runs are unique and fun to use
- Characters all look and feel great and they have a lot of their iconic moves implemented into their skill sets
- Progression is really good and there are plenty of permanent unlocks to make future runs easier
- Difficulty doesn't feel too hard but it isn't very easy either. I'd say it's fairly challenging at least as you're progressing. It does have some annoying levels that can have some cheap-ish enemy placement but that doesn't happen too often from my experience.

Cons:
- Story, so obviously it has nothing to do with Blazblue as I pointed out earlier which is disappointing for fans of the franchise (myself included) but I wouldn’t count it as a con if the story was good, it isn’t. It’s not that the story is necessarily bad, it's just nothing really happens (at least as of now, the game is still in early access) but it’s pretty short at least and you don’t have to pay much attention if any at all since it’s not the main focus of the game.",1692158834,1692247483,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The next day i get home from work i played it. After playing it a little THIS GAME IS FUCKING AMAZING AND I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.  Fantastic Combos, Reminds me of playing Dead Cell's or One step From Eden, and A TON OF ACHIEVEMENT'S. 

My only hope is that this game gains more content and character's (i recommend other modes for ex. Score Attack and Survival cause with the Mind challenges and the sandbox-level progression? Those modes could work. all in all love the game Rating it 100/100. Keep up the fantastic work and i hope this opens a new bridge for Blazblue.

Despite that it's a damn great looking game and runs great (it also has a mobile release go figure) along with fluid gameplay and multiple characters with their own gimmicks.

MP and SP resources aren't entirely clear as you have too look at the (tiny) skill icons to see if you have enough to use that specific skill. You acquire a character's skill moveset over the course of a run and they're either directional or hold inputs on the same button as the basic skill so you can't really bind them to separate buttons.

Two other things that weren't initially clear: 

- Heavy attacks exist and can be used by holding the basic attack button or otherwise is used at the end of a combo.
- Entropy is a number that builds up as you go through rooms. Unless you get rid of it through using one of the 10 levels in a zone to Rest then you have a %chance to corrupt and get a negative mod. For why this exists I'm not sure but I saw a few permanent upgrades that activate if you are corrupted. Perhaps it can change?

Cool thing in this game is that your previous run's characters are saved in a catalogue that you can take up to two with you and you'll now have the ability to use one of the two characters' skills which both have a shared cooldown. There's up to three other benefits per character you can get but they need to have a high enough run score.

There's a challenge mode which grants tokens to unlock new characters if you beat them. You need to build up a strong catalogue character in order to beat each mission and you only get one chance per saved character before they become unusable.


Gripes:
- Blazblue game but the characters have reused JP voicelines but the robot characters all speak Chinese. I can't stand hearing the language but either way a Blazblue game should have JP dubbing.

- Dashing out of an attack only cancels the endlag I believe but I wish I could cancel out of an attack earlier as I find myself locked in at times.

- Character sprites and portraits are reused from the fighting games but honestly I don't mind this.

- (Dualshock controller) Game has O to confirm and X to cancel by default (both apply to menus). The interact key is also on O but if you bind it to X your character does a jump before the game moves on. Please fix this, I binded it back to O in the meantime.

- Shader/Storage Drive stuttering. I have the game installed on an HDD and during some boots the game has unbearable couple second long pauses at times and it's hard not to feel annoyed. I'll be running through the gate that takes me to the next room and my character will still be running at the gate despite me reaching it.

- Some boss attacks can be unclear and untelegraphed at times so I'm more reliant on memorizing what poses do what attacks more than using reaction. 
* Key examples are the Serpent's sand pillars which track underneath you and barely have a tell.
* Fat guy in the first zone has multiple aoe attacks and enrages that sometimes do damage and other moves that don't despite them looking like they should. 
* Arakune's dash attack can start offscreen and goes from edge to edge of the arena. The only tell is the sound effect.",1692245455,1692245737,True,3,0,0.537091970443725586,0,True,False,True

My hope is that this person tries to do something new yet tie it back into Mori's lore, or maybe later they can get mori to step in to be the supervisor of the story and just write it himself in collaboration with this new writer sort of like FGO did where in the beginning of the game, the story did not have Nasu writing it, but then brought him over. I think what could happen as well too if the game is received positively in the long run, is to then have a team that does more original sprite works possibly for blazblue characters within the lore that have not yet been introduced to the game series or appeared in blazblue's other attempted mobile game that flopped: Dark War.


In terms of gameplay, at first it just felt what i expected. An action 2D rogue like game. The levels get pretty intense as you go on, with the furthest ahead i have gotten being with Mai Natsume...funnily enough she's the easiest character in this game as well like in Central fiction. As for people wondering where Terumi is, as i've seen people complain over, i can imagine he will make it in soon as a DLC character or...maybe they'll implement a Gacha system? Because first and foremost, this game is suppose to be a mobile game, with this just being an early access version of it, and many blazblue fans have been very disappointed and desperate for years in wanting a new blazblue game since central fiction. With Dark War disappointing many fans as it was nothing more but a bare bones FGO clone with admittedly very good thought out lore and concepts at play...but this game, it feels unique. This is the game where i honestly think Mori could make a comeback to reintroduce the series to the public with, and Possibly even bringing back the C series (the fighting games).


Rambling and getting off topic aside, The gameplay is fantastic, The story only leaving me with questions, mixed with both uncertainty and hope for what this could mean for the future of Blazblue, Should Mori take an interest in returning to ArcSys to direct the story direction. It has potential. Maybe this will end up becoming a blazblue universe of it's own similar to how Naoto has his.

I'm not a big die hard fan of the BlazBlue series...but I like them, and I have played them. I am big on 1-on-1 fighters, and BlazBlue is what I would rate as good.

Yes, like others said, this had BlazBlue tacked on to it to sell it, and it isn't really connected, so be warned if you care about that.

But man this combat can be intense. Its a good heavy combo action/platformer/fighter game. Its super fun and has a good challenge to it. You will be taking massive damage, but still feel like you are kicking serious butt too. I usually gauge a purchase off of how much time I think I can squeeze out of it to get my money's worth. The first play is usually just a few mins to get my feet wet....but this was pretty hard to put down. So I am confident I can put a couple hours at least into it over time.

Now, seriously pay attention to how I described this game in the last paragraph. Granted, I am still just starting out, but this doesn't feel Metroidvania to me. So far it just has been ""clear a room -> then reap the rewards"". I feel 0 exploration. But then again..I haven't gotten far, so maybe this changes. However, it is worth mentioning because this can disappoint players who think they will hop into a Symphony of the Night style game instantly. This has not been it so far...

But if you have the money, and are ok right now with early access...I really do recommend giving this a go. Just know what you are getting into: the BlazBlue Metriodvania game...that is not BlazBlue...and not Metriodvania.

Pros
-7 Different characters at launch, it helps make each run feel different
-One of the best progression systems I've seen for this kind of game
-It saves the score of a previous run to attach it to a character for your next run, the better you do the more passives this buff gives.
-It lets you reuse character from previous runs in a boss gauntlet sort of thing, keeping all items and abilities from that run.
-smooth combat and quite a few different combos for each character.
-price point is fair, they could add nothing more to this and it would still be worth the price.
-grinding higher scores feels satisfying, since it gives more stats for your next run

Cons
-It released within a few weeks of Baldur's Gate

alright well played for like 3 hours...there is potential here, the combat is surprisingly fun, the moves although recycled from CF are satisfying, the use of potentials to add new moves isn't as invasive as most roguelite and the sense of progressions is there even early on all that being said. i am not a blazblue fan, i have friends that are and that's why i know the characters, designs and basics and i did play BBtag and CF. but, i am playing this because of the combat and the waifus. 
every character plays different which is a plus althou you do have global moves, you can use 2 legacy move on a character from another which basically means you can put a dead spike on mai for example the potential for a good game is there.

if you are a blablue fan, you won't find any story regarding blazblue, the most you get is some random chibi robots talking about random stuff go up and down from your lab where you do the roguelite part of the game, and the challanges where you unlock new characters it is a true BLAZBLUEBALLS feeling if you are okay with that. you will find a game with a fun combat and good presentation",1692173584,1692202671,True,3,0,0.525716066360473633,0,True,False,True

First off, the elephant in the room: this is not a BlazBlue game.  I went in expecting and excited for some kind of action spinoff, but what I think has happened here is an unrelated game integrated the license late in development in the hopes of attracting more attention with a familiar IP.  What you get when you buy this game is an admissibly fun action roguelike, but it is not set in the world of BlazBlue, you don't even actually play the characters, you play some sort of cute floating robot that can pilot simulations of these characters - I think, it's not entirely clear.  
Point being, there is no meaningful connection to the series whose name is in the title; no narrative connection, no setting connection, even the BlazBlue characters only exist in this game as a vehicle for gameplay, they have no interaction with the game's actual premise or story.  They're functionally skins, considering they only vaguely resemble how they play in the mainline games.

Additionally, the game is not narrated in English as the trailers might lead you to believe.  The bulk of the game is narrated in Chinese with English subtitles, but what's really strange is that the character lines spoken by the BlazBlue characters are in Japanese, presumably they've just taken art and audio assets given to them by arc system works and stitched them into the game wholesale.

Is the game fun?  Yeah, it's a fun action roguelike, and I'm not going to return it because I think it's entertaining, but I also feel pretty badly misled by its store page.  I feel like the game itself has probably suffered for this weird license inclusion as well, considering the language mismatch, and the fact that the art style of the BlazBlue characters notably does not match the art style of the world they're placed in or the enemies they're fighting.
Entropy Effect isn't a cash grab, like some are suggesting, it's quite polished and it plays really well, but it [i]is[/i] some kind of bizarre frankensteinian fusion between the Entropy Effect the developers were originally making, and the BlazBlue license.

If I were to describe the story, it's like if Stray was way less interesting, but at least you still technically get to play a cat (Hi, Kokonoe). For some reason you go into a simulation where you play as Blazblue characters, and it feels very tacked on. While they put a lot of time and effort into fleshing out the characters kits for a side scrolling platformer beat 'em up style action game, I really hope the story and setting does a full 180 and sees a total rewrite/overhaul to make it an actual extension of Blazblue canon, and the new additions feel rather uninspired and disconnected.

But you might not like it if you just want to mash and have a get out of jail free iframe dodge at any time. There are plenty of other fantastic games for that.

(note: the dodge [i]is[/i] invincible, you just can't normally use it if you've committed to an attack already. You know. Like in BlazBlue.)

While it may be true that the BlazBlue characters were a later addition slotted into an existing framework, it's simply inaccurate that it was a lazy paste-in of existing assets given to them by ArcSys. There has [i]clearly[/i] been a lot of thought put into which characters would be used in the game, and how their kits would translate into this style of play. Your starting actions are fairly simple and limited, but they grow over the course of a run, growing your moveset to give you more fun and interesting options. Some characters, like Noel, even have a pretty free-form base kit, allowing you to fly all over the stage with Chain Revolver.

I'm really enjoying seeing how the devs have expanded on the source material.

It's fair enough if the game isn't what you wanted or what you thought it was based on the marketing, but the game is genuinely pretty good. I like BlazBlue a lot, I like Entropy Effect a lot, and I foresee myself playing it a lot.

I had a suspicion this would be the case based on trailers I had seen of the game, but I can imagine many feel blindsided by this fact.]

That said, what you get is a fun roguelite platformer, if somewhat barebones at the moment. The movement and action feels very slick and and the artwork for the levels is very charming. As you go through each run you sometimes have the opportunity to unlock additional moves to expand your chosen character's kit. In my time so far I'm finding that there are many fun and satisfying ways to string different moves together, though it's more limited and simplistic than those accustomed to fighting games may be used to. You also get various passive effects as you go; these feel pretty generic, and I never felt especially excited about earning them. They don't really take anything away by their presence, but they're not really adding anything either.

There's a notable discord in art styles; the sprites for the BlazBlue characters appear to re-used assets from mainline BB, and they do not match the style of the enemy sprites. It didn't bother me, and I didn't feel like they looked completely out of place; others may find it bothersome, however.

There are also some translation issues. A lot of skill names don't accurately explain what they do or are worded very strangely. The story is nigh incomprehensible? Many gameplay elements are not explained very well either, leaving you to figure out how they function through guesswork.

All said and done, I feel the game was worth the price of entry.

2273430,144323958,76561197993435570,0,37,1088,0,414,1699663530,"The combat ranges from the high end of competent to pretty good, especially when you get several potentials going so your character has more than 4 things they can do. Most enemies can be countered through knowing their moves and controlling your actions.

Artwork is good, though the color palettes are uninspired and many of the combat effects don't pop out enough to be noticeable when you're frantically trying to bounce around. A lot of 'I'm gonna hit this with my next attack' boxes that enemies and bosses drop are straight-up lying to you, as well.

The upgrades between missions come at a decent pace, comparable to Hades, though they aren't as interesting and can't be respec'd between runs like in Hades, so no experimenting allowed. As far as the random elements within the run, there's a bit of a problem with how often not fighting is an option and how valid a choice it is. Finally, the upgrades are just totally out of whack. They come in two flavors, Potentials, which are 'major' upgrades that are per-character, and Tactics which are smaller, character-agnostic buffs.

Now, the Potentials add significant character power and flexibility, unlocking combos and special moves and so when you get them, picking which one is a meaningful choice that you'll feel the outcome of,  The Potentials are great.

Unfortunately, Potentials are given out at a positively miserly pace. Your bread and butter upgrades are Tactics, and tactics feel awful. They give you modest buffs to your damage output by adding elemental effects to specific moves, sometimes causing moves that weren't originally attacks to gain damage properties (crouching, especially). While that sounds okay on paper, which Tactics you get totally fail to significantly influence your play style. Since you can only have one 'base' elemental enhancement per move type (one for your basic attack, one for your skills, one for your dash, maybe one just goes off randomly, one for when you take a hit), and there are something like 8 different elements, actually making a synergistic build that focuses on one or even just two elements is almost impossible, since you only get three choices each time they appear and a maximum of two rerolls per run. In short, you're going to wind up taking several Tactics just because they were the one out of the three that wasn't worthless to you, your build will feel all over the place, and any synergies you manage to construct will be awkward at best. Tactics just aren't fun.

Finally, there's the setting and story. Now, the characters and story of BlazBlue were a major part of why I loved it, and so putting the name ""BlazBlue"" on a game implies to me that those characters and that story are going to be part of the game, and this is why I can't recommend this game to others: This is not a BlazBlue game. The game feels like it simply used the BlazBlue sprites and movesets instead of bothering designing their own characters and just dropped them into the game without context. There is absolutely no reason for us to be playing as Ragna or Noel and no explanation for whether or not they exist in the world we're in. We could be playing as Teletubbies for all it would affect the game's story. A couple of the enemies are recognizable from BlazBlue backgrounds, but they are equally acontextual. Most of the bosses aren't even remotely related to BlazBlue, with the sole exception of Giant Arakune who just kind of shows up at the end of one of the stages.

A minor addition to 'doesn't feel like Blazblue', but still INCREDIBLY disappointing was that Entropy Effect doesn't use any of the BlazBlue series' FANTASTIC music. It's got an entirely new and completely forgettable and boring soundtrack.

Overall, the game feels like a Chinese group made it using the sprites without permission, then went to get permission before they released it to the part of the world that respects copyright laws, but never actually bothered to add any real BlazBlue flavor to it, so it remains a cheap knockoff, even with copyright permissions.

I'd really love to see things change, with improved balancing of Potentials vs Tactics, stages that are even remotely related to BlazBlue lore, or have any sort of logic to why we're there and our enemies are there, a story that actually involves elements of BlazBlue's narrative, and some of the excellent music from the original games, but until a couple of those happen, this game isn't worth your money or time.",1692179866,1692179866,False,27,0,0.705278933048248291,0,True,False,True

There are different settings and you're randomly put into one of them when you start a run. Each setting has it's own enemies and, at the end, it's own boss. There are a few stages per section and once you finish a section, you're put into a new setting. Between stages, there are different options you can choose from that will determine what the next stage will be. One is just a standard option that takes you to the next stage, another is a store where you can use currency you've gathered in stages to purchase different benefits for your run, another is a sort of chance time stage that gives you a random benefit (or sometimes can give you nothing at all), and another is a rest stage that gets rid of your entropy, entropy being something you gain between stages. If you have too much entropy, you start to gain debuffs, which is why the rest stages are there to get rid of it. The game is somewhat fast paced, and can be tricky at first, but once you put some hours in, parts of it can be pretty easy to get used to.

The combat itself is actually not that bad, but everything around it that sucks up the enjoyment. 

The whole gameplay loop revolves around picking your character, going to a random stage and beating up enemies that spawn out of thin air. You then get transfered to some Sci-fi room that looks nothing like the place you've just visited and gives you an ability to either upgrade, rest or continue to the next level. The whole world is just a simulation with disjointed places like these that forcibly stop you from having fun since the stages can be completed in less than 30 seconds. I honestly can't believe that I'm saying this, but it's the Simulated Universe from Honkai Star Rail....but worse.

Also the game keeps shoving you this very convoluted story about the whole world and the little robot you control outside of combat but damn....i kinda don't care?
The narration is also done in Chinese, not English.

Honestly, Entropy Effect feels like a huge slap in the face for Blazblue fans, and with everything so out of place in this game, I could bet my 20 bucks BB characters were only included by the devs to save up on time and resources to make this cash grab. Please don't support that behavior.

this game has almost nothing to actually do with blazblue, the characters are just a vessel for the gameplay to break up the bits of not very interesting story where floating wall-e robots talk about a fairly generic cyberpunk conspiracy (at least that's as far as i got), there's no actual reference to anything blazblue at all. your player character has some very sassy dialogue options which is kinda fun though.

the gameplay has some interesting ideas with the entropy system and the way it does progression (through tactics which are small generic talents and potentials which are big character-specific talents), but the combat itself feels like somebody wanted dead cells without understanding it. all the chaos of dead cells without any of the maneuverability your player character needs to navigate it effectively (enjoy getting clipped by random enemies while you're in an attack animation). you really are controlling a fighting game character in this game, which if it were designed with that in mind may have made for a clever adaptation, but i don't think it works for the game they actually made. when you have enough potentials, you can actually start doing some cool anime stuff, but getting there is an unenjoyable slog.

the most charming parts of this game are probably the visuals, which the art direction is legitimately gorgeous, and the music, which adds some very nice ambience to the game, but neither of these things can make up for what's fundamentally just not fun combat and a not interesting story or characters.

BlazBlue is a story told by someone having both a fever dream and a massive LSD trip, and they couldn't find a way to relate anything back to BlazBlue? Just some mysterious story about a VR simulation with nothing actually having to do with the characters?

This game so far has legit felt like a standard Roguelike game with BlazBlue as guest characters.

A bit janky in a couple areas but it's incredibly fun and has a ton of potential to grow. Back when I played Guilty Gear Judgement on the PSP it always kinda confused me how Arc System Works never thought to make more action/beat-em-up side modes/spin-offs of their games, or for more anime fighting game devs to follow suit. Closest I can imagine is maybe the RPG mode in Granblue Fantasy Versus, but I haven't played it myself yet to really judge. Personally hoping this paves the way for more games like it, it's pretty neat.

Though as a Blazblue game, I'm kinda puzzled. I'll be upfront, I don't play the main series, and I've heard Blazblue's story is a lot to take in, but even I'm personally confused as to what this game has to do with Blazblue other than it using characters from the series for you to play as.
