A lot of comments and review have written before. And I wouldn't be too original if I will say it's good, definitely high-class game. There aren't too much faceless and clone-like weapons. In my humble opinion it's neither too big nor too small amount of weapons in the game. Because you feel each one unique. And I'd say the same about the enemies. There are different types of them, with solid design [spoiler](which is always good to have consistent design approach)[/spoiler].

There's also some plot about what is going on in the game's world. It includes cute and funny cutscenes with nice comic-like art-style. The plot is simple, but kind and does its job well enough.

All in all I do recommend you to try it. It also has a co-op, different classes to play as, which could improve your progress pace. And on the market it's the best offer for now, if you're looking for Rogue-Like shooter.",1709071377,1709072179,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Jokes aside, Roboquest is GREAT.

The gameplay is very simple but mastefully executed, you simply take out as many robots as possible with your weapon(s) of choice. The variety within the weapons is almost overwhelming, giving you access to drastically different choices almost every run. Despite the crazy variety, each weapon is relatively easy to use, but mastery usually takes some getting used to. This gives the player a variety of choices when it comes to their perferred style of combat, as well as keeping the moment to moment gameplay fresh and exciting. If you like more consistency, you can usually find some variation of your perferred weapon(s) in each playthrough. The upgrades are frequent and helpful, but never make you feel TOO overpowered. The upgrades/items are also very simple and consistent, so no one silly little item can make or break your playthrough, and you won't have to do 3 hours of research to determine the best choice. One thing I can say this game does better than any in it's category is that it feels extremely fair. The gameplay is simply so well crafted that I rarely find myself getting upset with the game, the majority of your deaths will be to your own mistakes and shortcomings. The game is significantly more skill based than a lot of others I've seen in this category and it's incredibly fun and satisfying to watch yourself get better. This game has no annoying gimmicks, a fantastic soundtrack, and gameplay that relies more on skill than anything. I can't stress enough that it's so refreshing to find a game in this category that doesn't rely on you getting certain items or to have good luck to get the most enjoyable experience. Each individual run is just as fun and enjoyable as the last, even the ones where luck isn't necessarily on your side. If the game decides to give you the crappiest, lowest tier weapons and the most useless items, you still have a solid chance to do well since the gameplay is mostly based on your skills with evading enemy fire and making use of the weapons that the game gives you.  On top of all of this, the art style is amazing (although the difference between it and the graphics in game are a bit jarring) and the soundtrack is excellent. I've added quite a few songs from this game into my workout playlist, it's perfect to keep you engaged and moving.

TLDR: Roboquest is an incredibly skill based game that keeps the moment to moment gameplay fresh and exciting. Each playthrough is equally as fun, and you don't have to rely on getting a certain set of items or one lucky item just to have an interesting playthrough. The soundtrack is fantastic, art style is fantastic, and the story is simple and wholesome (at least from what I've seen, there could be some dark twist at the end that I don't know about but I highly doubt it lmao) Realistically if you like FPS games and roguelike/lites, there's no reason to NOT get Roboquest. This is the best game available in the Roguelike/lite category right now IMO and will inevitably set you up for an extremely enjoyable 10/10 experience.

Super TLDR: Very fun addicting shooting game that requires no luck to operate. Every moment of gameplay is fun and each new run is just as fun as the last since no items/upgrades make or break your playthrough. 10/10 highly reccomend.",1705539871,1708733864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game can improve in terms of boosts, bonuses, etc. Post upgrades, the wrenches don't add anything to the game. An extra life for an obscene amount of in-game currency would be fair and could allow fun builds to be experimented with. Also, the inability to return to the camp between games is a slight problem. For example, other similar games allow for runs to be picked up at a later stage. With runs lasting from anywhere between 30 to 90 minutes, the time commitment to see it through is excessive.  The movement mechanics and the varied weapons are great, but there is no change to how the levels are. So at the end of the day it's about whether the prospect of beating the game across different difficulties in a time-bound system is a good enough hook for you. Buy the game if it is on sale, but don't be drawn by the multiplayer promise, that needs a lot of work and is not the smooth experience that is promised.

The game design is excellent, constantly throwing you into the action and everything serves to enrich the gameplay. You are put into a flow state to kill as many enemies as possible.

The game encourages you to try out all of its 6 different classes, 70+ unique weapons, and an insane amount of unique item buffs to create your perfect build and get that faster clear time. There’s a jet pack, a grappling hook, and a slide jumping mechanic similar to black ops 3. Move fast and kill fast, slaying room after room of enemies and bosses. Everything works towards progressing and making you stronger for the next challenge and the next difficulty and reinforces good decision making when you play.

It’s fast paced and action packed and will actually improve your aim, tracking, and target acquisition for other fps games you play- you are constantly improving your own gameplay.

Moving around and shooting feels good, as it should, but everything else is pretty uninspired.

The weapons too are pretty much just... Weapons that exist. Nothing new or interesting, really.

Most of the enemies are super obnoxious, mostly with the projectiles that stick to surfaces and take some time before exploding, which are pretty much omnipresent.

They really went all out with 1.0, the game feels very complete now, love what they added.

The gameplay is Doom 2016 inspired, meaning your only source of healing during combat is ennemy drops which disappears pretty fast, incentivising an agressive playstyle.
Thing is, I wasn't a big fan of Doom's pacing, too much exploration to do, it breaks the rythm.
Now this game doesn't have that, it has some light exploration of the levels for data logs (lore) but once you get them, the game is 100% adrenaline-fueled fighting, with the occasional safe areas to level up your build and breathe a little.

just please make it work
and please dont add co-op cheevs and we are all good

Co-op is being taken over by bots now, that just speed zoom hack and then still die and rage quit.
This game is out of control.
Once you beat the sp 
there is NOTHING else for you but to be R word by bots or kids
FIX CO-OP or REMOVE it
I named 90 ways to mend this..
zero emails back to me. 
Until this is mended Id avoid this game at all costs

PLEASE note my time played: this was helping people
now its a flood of wemod chinese morons

thanks devs
zero support
zero security and no back bone FIX YOUR GAME 
spit


EDIT:

Okay mates
the most current version is in and well !
It's fantastic!
Are there issues, of course
I will list a few, but all in all, WOW... just truly superlative game here

I will list more in the positives, but honestly.. everything not in the issues is just friggen awesome*

Issues: 
Stuck in walls, areas, shooting is off sometimes not firing
MAIN ONE  the game looks blurry, I know, I know its the AA, but its truly bad for pc or larger aspects, its even bad on standard with 1080
Almost no settings exist in gfx options  hope this changes
Epic login voids steam players connection via quickplay
I cant confirm if this voids ID to ID on steam, I think that works always

More edit:  SEE REVAMP EDIT AT THE TOP  THE DEVS IGNORED MANY SO BYE BYE cya in the 1$ bin soon

this games co-op needs serious fixing, there is not much to do end game, at all
no reason to keep playing, could easily add an arena or shooting range to keep busy..

The gunplay feels very much like Overwatch frenziest moments at times and you can only be rewarded for topping speed to complete the stages, the faster you go better will be your reward, OR you can go your own speed, relax and try to explore the maps and there is sooo much to be said about the secrets and challenges in this game which happen naturally as you progress. This is a secret filled FPS, you are thinking of DOOM? Yes you are not far, Roboquest is better on that aspect. Yes. They really a great job on putting some FAT around the basic rogue like structure, now we have an entertaining, diverse and meaningful list of achievements but of course the game is more than Steam achievement list, in fact in game has a lot more challenges of all kind and are seamlessly integrated in your progression. 

Overall if you are looking for an exciting 45 min/a day outlet to welcome you after a hard day of work, less if you like to binge for hours in a single game for a week end.
Quick note so far I have 40 hours of gameplay and that is playing with just with one of the five prototypes, I have never even tried the 4 others so I can already tell you that I am far from being done with Roboquest I think can easily add 20-30 hours of gameplay before I switch to something else.

In single player the game is just what you see in trailer. Dodge shit while using the different classes, items, and weapons with class upgrades per run. A good roguelike FPS that rewards speed and knowledge and runs end quickly after mistakes.

The game does not work well in co-op. The currency used in runs (Power Cells) are dropped by enemies along with health and meta game currency and these drops dissolve within a few seconds after dropping. This mean that you'll need to hug eachother's ass in co-op. Killing enemies in different areas halves the drops each player can pick up. Missing health drops is not the big issue, but missing the currency used per run is. If those pickups were shared I would give a positive review.

Buy on sale for single player if you want good practice for playing competitive shooters with alot of movement, treat the co-op as an afterthought.",1707718345,1707718345,False,6,2,0.511656761169433594,0,True,False,False

The music in this game is some of the best in the entire genre, immersing players in its thrilling world. Additionally, the gunplay is smooth and responsive, enhancing the overall gaming experience.
One of the standout features of Roboquest is its satisfying character progression, which is well put together. Players will find themselves motivated to keep progressing as they unlock new abilities and upgrades. The weapon variety in the game is also impressive, with a wide range of weapons to choose from. The inclusion of weapon affixes further adds depth to the gameplay, allowing for strategic decision-making.
The developers have done a commendable job in improving Roboquest over the years. The game has come a long way since its initial release, and the efforts put into fixing its issues are evident. This commitment to improvement is commendable and adds to the overall enjoyment of the game.
However, one aspect that Roboquest falls short in is enemy variety. You will find themselves encountering the same types of enemies repeatedly, which can make the gameplay feel repetitive. Additionally, certain enemy attacks can be annoying, adding frustration to the gameplay experience.
In terms of price and playtime, Roboquest is reasonably priced at $25 and can be completed in around 10-20 hours. This makes it a relatively short yet satisfying experience.
Overall, Roboquest offers an exhilarating gameplay experience with its exceptional music, smooth gunplay, and satisfying character progression. While it still has room for improvement in terms of enemy variety and certain enemy attacks, the game has shown significant growth and is worth checking out for fans of the genre.",1630476607,1707673040,True,0,0,0.459035396575927734,0,True,False,True

Roboquest plays very well. It's fast paced, not unlike Ultrakill or Doom, but definitely slower than both of the games I mentioned. The guns and various other weapons feel amazing, the modifiers for weapons are interesting, the class upgrades are unique, and the general mechanics are very polished. 

When it comes to the visuals, the entire artstyle feels like Borderlands meets comic books, especially within the weapon designs. I really enjoy the visuals cause while they are cartoony, they also aren't overly cartoony. The game feels like a lot of time, effort, and passion was put into it. The music is also really well done. It's intense, fast-paced background music that doesn't immediately jump out but it goes hard.

The upgrade system allows for some pretty neat builds, which I'm looking forward to trying on the other characters I unlocked.

The controls/graphic setup is super customizable which really helps to make the game feel better to play. 

Really my only main complaints are about the logs/quest progression. Going out of your way to collect logs slows your time down, which basically means you're going to get a lower rank for trying to explore. This makes it harder to do a full run if you're going for logs.  

I'm not a huge fan of the music, but that's a personal preference.

The good parts:
[list]
    [*]Generally polished and bug-free
    [*]High-quality visuals, if bland
[/list]
Issues:
[list]
    [*]Homogeneous: low enemy variety, superficial weapon modifiers, weapons are mostly machine guns, semi-auto rifles or grenade launchers, bosses appear in the same circular arena with a fight that is too easy, goes on for too long an always plays out the same way.
    [*]Low sense of danger: this is mostly due to the way the health bar works. It is too big, and acts more like a currency than the only thing between you and death.
    [*]Some goofy systems of dubious value: weapons have ""levels"" and modifiers. These amount to stat changes. A higher level weapon will appear later in the run. The result is that optimal play means dropping your current weapon for a new one every room. Since most of the weapons are rather boring, this usually means dropping one of the few fun weapons for some variant of an SMG.

Roboquest will scratch your FPS Roguelike itch, then sooth it over with with local anaesthetic, heal it with a kill-all antiseptic patch...

BECAUSE I MUST COMPLETE GUARDIAN 4 DIFFICULTY!!!

Review guidelines be dammed, Roboquest is pretty awesome. It's not a progressive cover based shooter. It's a perfectly paced shooter with a tonne of secrets, unlocks and randomised elements. If you're a fan of Gunfire: Reborn... I regret to inform you that upon playing Roboquest you'll never play Gunfire again!

The base movement of the game is a lot like Quake rather than Borderlands or Call of Duty. It's super fluent and feels very responsive. As you grow your repertoire of mobility bonuses (jetpacks and grappling hooks included) you'll begin to see the racing line and dare yourself to speedrun on your next playthrough. The weapons are varied enough to feel completely unique. Different playstyles are possible and rewarded. The game favours close range builds in terms of healing potential, because at long range you shouldn't be getting hit.

Mechanically the game was designed by a genius. There is no pistol MK1 or pistol MK2 nonsense. On average every single weapon has the same DPS so choose a weapon you feel comfortable with. Ultimately your build choices will break that rule. The permanent upgrades outside of each run will facilitate you and simply create more opportunities for finding the right combination of abilities and weapons to suit your style.

The level design looks very simple at first glance but your unlocked mobility options completely change how you tackle them. The route you choose from the first level to the last matters. For example (and assuming you have unlocked corresponding secrets) one route gives you a randomised legendary buff whereas another route will give you a free ability choice and a randomised epic weapon. Other routes can potentially shortcut you to the final levels of the game where your skill will decide if you can tackle them while under levelled.

And Max is freaking awesome!

Mechanically the game is fantastic. The movement is smooth and responsive, and so is the shooting. The game’s levels give a lot of room for player’s creativity, with plenty of good interactable elements, as well as a lot of optional verticality.

The weapons specifically deserve a special mention. Each gun sets itself apart quite nicely, with its own mechanics, shooting pattern and sound design. The selection is quite large, but not so large that it’s rare to stumble upon a weapon that maybe you really liked from a previous run. It feels perfect, in other words. I suspect there might be a system running in the background keeping track of how much a player uses certain weapons.

The game also excels from a game design point of view. Pretty much all of standard roguelike staples are here, and they’re well executed: branching paths determining the progression of the run, reroll tokens, a selection of classes with unique identities and their own sets of abilities, as well as plenty of choice when it comes to weapons, builds, perks, etc. The enemy variety is pretty great too, each room having a different combination often presents a unique challenge, as certain enemies will require a specific strategy to tackle.

I would also particularly like to highlight the level-up perk selection, and design choices there. Very often in games of this nature you get presented with a choice of abilities that have a clear winner most of the time. Roboquest has a pretty large and diverse selection of perks that all help facilitate different playstyles, and the selections it presents has often led me to sit there for a minute and ponder which option would be better for my build.

The game also shines aesthetically. The visuals, sound design and music are all top notch. The game has a very bright, vivid, comic-book visual style that is quite striking. It’s vibrant and colourful, and just a pleasure to look at. If I had to compare it to something, it would probably be Borderlands. The sound design is solid, with weapons having their own unique shooting and reload sounds, as well the audio feedback being very clear, distinct and satisfying. Getting repeated crits in particular pleases my monkey brain greatly. I have to applaud the music, too. A great selection of catchy, pounding, techno bangers that complement the fast-paced action and get you “in the zone” very easily.

The game also has a story. It’s nothing more than a few stop-motion cutscenes the game plays when reaching certain milestones, as well as numerous text logs that I'll confess I haven't read. It’s not a slight against the game by any means, but it does feel a bit tacked-on. The best thing I can say about it is it adds a little bit of charm to the game.

All in all, the game is a shining example of the genre, and an easy recommend.

There's a lot to like about Roboquest. The graphics style is fun, there are a wide variety of weapons, the music is great and I love the level themes. However, the gameplay loop is quite shallow. I can only seem to get through a run or two before I feel the need to move on to something else. Perhaps unlocking more in-game content/upgrades will help going forward or perhaps the devs will add some interesting features before exiting early access. For now, it fails to keep my attention but I will continue check in on major updates and hope for the best.

Full Release:
Decided to give Roboquest another go since the game is now out of early access, however, my opinion has not changed much. Still like a lot of qualities of the game but tend to get bored after a run or two. The variety of weapons, split paths and playable robots help make the runs feel unique but its still quite limited compared to other roguelikes or lites which this one is. The maps are the same every time, the power ups gained are too few/limited to excite me. Seems like it makes more sense to constantly switch weapons rather than upgrading which can be frustrating when you find a combination you like. Not to mention that you often select upgrades based on your current weapons. 

Again, this is not a bad game. Its just not holding my attention like other games in the same genre. Just want to give a different perspective besides the overwhelmingly positive reviews.",1659032591,1706909690,False,0,0,0.457518070936203003,0,True,False,True

 + Movement is smooth and controllable.
 + Debuffs inflicted on you are creative and well made.
 + 3d models are very well made.
 - Abilities feel a little wimpy.
 - Class system is not very ambitious.
 - The randomized part of this game is very limited so the runs blend together.
 - Some guns are simply worse than others.

Story: 14/20
 + I love how they were able to give a identifiable character to the player-bot in such a short time without the use of dialogue.
 + The antagonist fills the same role as a Saturday cartoon villain.
 - Not very ambitious or innovative, though I imagine that was intentional.

Presentation: 18/20
 + Love the art style with the comic book presentation.
 + Music is great and only drops while in combat.
 + I love the loading screen between stages; They ooze with style.

18h in, I have maybe seen half of the content available and I am just enjoying my time. I haven't even played all the characters and not found all the weapons yet. There is just so many possibilities.

It is a RogueLite, so you will be stronger with every run and additionally there are many subgoals apart from beating the final boss. I have actually never seen the final boss yet but still enjoy the progession so far.
Many different (permanent) upgrades to find and collect, mini-missions to accomplish and things to unlock. It is great!

Your whole body is pumped with serotonine and adrenaline while playing this, as its just that fast with a great loot system and visually impressive combat.

Your runs tend to get quicker and quicker so the ""hard"" levels turn into easy ones that you rush through at a certain point. Therefor you dont spend too much time in one run and dont feel too sad when losing one.

Just test it for yourself and get hooked.

It's has a lot of neat weapons and  plenty of build variety, and several characters which offer a lot of variety to your approach each run. There are a few small quests and gadgets you pick up across several runs which massively expand your mobility options and eventually build up to make you incredibly powerful. This may be the root of my only real complaint though.

It's a pretty minor one, which not everyone will take issue with, but early on this game is pretty difficult, and it feels nice to work your way up to the finish on the harder difficulties after building up your arsenal through upgrades, but I felt like my character got a little too powerful too fast. Once you unlock most of the upgrades available, the game becomes significantly easier, the new difficulties felt trivial nearly as soon as we unlocked them. 

I think I would have preferred if it either toned down the upgrades and mobility gadgets a bit (by the end game you can basically keep yourself airborne for however long you please.) or made the extra difficulty's scaling harsher.

My one complaint is the difficulty scaling.

This game has a ton of potential for beautiful skill expression, but I think for a lot of people the settings that exist right now will oscillate between too hard and too easy, making it difficult to play in a way that feels challenging and meaningful.

[Coop only experience]

I would like to begin this review with the only complaint I have about the game: the multiplayer servers are a bit unstable at times. After playing the demo with a friend (the fact that this is possible is great), we purchased the game and wanted to start playing. However, we were unable to connect to each other initially. After restarting our games and retrying, it eventually worked. This issue occurred again on another occasion. Once connected, there are usually no problems, but on a single occasion, we disconnected in the middle of a run, effectively ending it. In a worst-case scenario, this could result in a time loss of 30 - 45 minutes. Since it happened only once within 20 hours, we were not that frustrated.

Despite the issues mentioned above, the game is amazing. It defines itself as a 'fast-paced FPS with Roguelite mechanics', and it truly delivers on all fronts. The gunplay is smooth and highly satisfactory. There are a lot of ways to alter the default behaviour of your weapons, making things even more fun and allowing for multiple builds. Different classes are available, and there are mechanics in place that allow you to permanently strengthen your character, even after failed runs. I was unaware of this game's existence, and it blew my mind when we played the demo.

Lastly, I would like to discuss the game's difficulty. We opted for the hardest difficulty right from the beginning, as that's our usual approach. Beat the first chapter relatively 'easy' and felt good about ourselves. Second chapter delivered a harsh reality check as we got our asses kicked.  After investing several hours in learning the game's mechanics, we finally progressed to chapter three. We felt really good about our builds and were ready to slay. We got absolutely demolished and sent to the grave. 

At the time of review, 20 hours in, we are still struggling in chapter three and have yet to complete a single run. Part of it is because we did not explore enough, part of it is simply because our movement is not good enough yet. The game is hard, it really is. But it is not unfair. I would say it has a high skill ceiling, particularly in terms of movement. But I know for a fact, that if I just 'git gud', I can eventually beat it. And I am loving it. 

Note that you can change the difficulty at any point in time if you wish.",1706610881,1706610881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I used to play GunFire Reborn to satisfy the niche of FPS Roguelites but this has taken its place. Roboquest is the opposite of the slow pacing of GunFire reborn. This game has a bunch of mechanics that encourage you to go as fast as possible as creatively as possible.

You can:
 -Slide to move faster in short bursts
 -Use explosives to rocket jump across levels
 -Slide on rails to get around fast and dodge projectiles
 -Mario stomp on enemies to bounce up on them to keep your momentum 

I love movement mechanics in games and this just satisfies me greatly. 

There is a great variety of weapons to choose from, but I will say that you will quickly recognize that not all of them are created equal. 

I would also shy away from comparisons to ""Doom"" and ""Borderlands"", this game is not like either of those games. People compare it to Doom because you move fast and enemies drop orbs when you die, and people compare it to Borderlands because the weapons have funny colors.

First, huge props to the devs for including a range of difficulty options. One thing I tend to dislike about thee types of games is the time-investment required to even start making minor progress. By being able to lower the difficulty, the player can quickly unlock most of their upgrades, then kick the difficulty back up when they feel more prepared for the challenge. Which makes the game so much more fun, than frustrating. 

Really dig the art and aesthetics in this one. It has a very unique graphic novel/painterly/cell shaded look to it. But it doesn't really remind me of Borderlands at all. The weapon selections , upgrades, classes and their associated synergies are all extremely fun and add so much replayability to the game.

Now, this is NOT an open world game. It's a tunnel runner, where at the end (or elsewhere) of each stage you have an option to choose a specific path, if you've managed to unlock it. The whole game can be run start-to-end in less than 45 mins, but the game has a great amount of replayability. I've completed it twice now, with a lot of ""going for a quick run with the aim to unlock something"" runs, and still got a huge bunch of things to unlock. I've only really played recon, but you have 5 or 6 classes to play as.

A lot of different guns and a lot of silly items that both give and take.

Oh and the soundtrack? It's awesome. The music greatly pumps up the levels.

Wholeheardly recommend the game if you're into FPS and like roguelite mechanics, and the little unlockings that come with it. Heavy recommendation on not looking up things or following guides until you've ran out of things to explore.

This game is really good, both in terms of fps AND rougelite elements. The FPS elements are really fun and satisfying, partially because of the visual style and the guns feel like they have actual power to them thanks to the animation and sound details. It's a movement shooter but I'm pretty sure you can play it boots on the ground style as well if that's more your thing, outside of the boss battles at least. Point is it feels good to play.
I feel like a lot rougelites tend to screw up with upgrades and progression by making them boring and one note, simple stat buffs not forcing you to adapt at all, leading to samey runs and quick repetition. Roboquest takes this common mistake out behind the house and shoots it in the back of the head. There is a ton of variety, not only does each character class feel unique to play, a lot of the upgrades you get in your runs are conditional modifiers incentivizing different playstyles and uses of your abilities, meaning even when picking the same class you can have drastically different runs. Picking the hunter class for example you might lean heavily into the damage of your basic ability and use it to snipe threats with spears while you deal with the less threatening enemies, or you might rely on the clone you leave behind, or you might have a run similar to the one I just did, where you use camo and sneak into groups of enemies and trigger explosions around them as they shoot your clone. Even the most basic character can turn his invincibility shield into an AOE damaging fire bubble, or into a short but powerful DPS steroid, or even both if you get lucky with your options and make it far enough, so don't let me catch you not giving the game a shot. Play the demo, if you like it, you'll like the full game.
Long term progression is actually fairly quick for a rougelite but it feels amazing as the stuff you unlock has a heavy effect on gameplay in a good way. You feel substantially more powerful with each new acquired secret. There is also a kind-of-skill tree that helps make your runs more consistent and give you more options through NPCs, so none of the long term progression is as dumb as ""Free damage lol"".
They don't even drop the ball with difficulty, it gets really tough, especially towards the end, but if you know how to move, aim and which targets to prioritize, you'll succeed. And if you find it too easy still, well, there are 4 harder difficulties on top of hard mode so you'll find your challenge.
Visually the game is just fun. Outside of the little girl being straight from uncanny valley, it's simple, charming and fun, very obviously comic book-inspired, if you shoot a gun you'll see just how fun that style can be. It's also not cluttered, enemies tend to pop out of the environment, especially their red eyes, which are, of course, crit spots. It supports the gameplay really well.
The story is truly one of the stories of all time. It's short, but there are data logs if story's your thing. It's all very cartoony.
Also, not only is the audio design clean as hell, the soundtrack is full of bangers. One of my favourite parts of this game is fighting the second to last boss because their theme makes me wanna smash something. It's insane how good it sounds.

The Devs were cool about totally reworking game mechanics and powers so it was fun to check in to see how it changed. Now it's 1.0 and it's definitely really good. It became my ""crack game"" where I fiend for it every night after work, trying to beat this challenge or get that achievement etc. 

The shooting and movement is the star of this game. As soon as I found the ""duck slide"" combo I was hooked. It feels SO good whenever you slide under enemy fire. And you can slide backwards, to the side, etc. There's tons more movement abilities to unlock (I wont spoil) and once you have the whole kit it feels really good.

There's tons of weapons and they're all unique and fun to use, some with some pretty niche uses but if you build into them you can unlock their full potential (like thrown tomahawks that technically do ""melee"" damage).  Weapons are pretty much either ""magazine"" based (bullets) or ""energy"" based (they overheat).  So there's a bunch of cool futuristic energy weapons like shotguns with bouncing projectiles, or homing miniguns. There's a rarity system that applies more and more ""affixes"" (ie modifiers) to the weapons. So you could have something cool like a Shock Rifle that has a chance to burn enemies, that does more crit damage, and has an alt-fire that shoots out a grenade. 

Something that sets this apart from other FPS games is you do not have to worry about ammo! And your offhand gun auto-reloads when you aren't using it. So it incentives just going ham and swapping weapons when one runs out of ammo. 

Killing enemies gets you XP, and you get a class perk choice when levelling up. It also drops some little green bits of health that heal you a bit. If you're good at avoiding damage you are rewarded with heals between pit-stops. This is also a pretty addicting thing in the game, just hoovering up all those yummy pellets. 

There's 6 classes and they're all really fun and with different styles of play even within the same class. I've played a ton of ||Elementalist|| so that's really fun. 

Throughout the run you'll be able to buy items that give you buffs. Simple things like ""energy weapons 15% more damage"" to cool ones like ""Sliding fires grenades in front of you."" These and your levelup perks are the meat of making builds. They usually cost ""power cells"" which you gain killing enemies and doing parkour challenges. And you earn more if you get a high ranking on a level so you are incentived to play well (measured in game by # of enemies killed and how fast you got through the level). 

The enemies are all varying types of robots. Silver spheres with big red crit spots are what theyre all basically based off. But they are able to make them dinstinct enough that even at a glance in the middle of a fight you can recognize what youre going up with, what attacks they do, etc, so you can prioritize threats. 

There's also tons of little secrets and quests you do throughout each of your runs. These are what unlock permanent upgrades and you definitely want to do them all. I had to look some up. 

My main complaint is that it was kinda annoying for the first dozen runs since you have nothing unlocked in your base tree, for giving you better chances at upgraded weapons and stuff. So youre just stuck with a bunch of white weapons with hardly any affixes. So I wish we powered up the base faster. My tip is to do runs  on an easier difficulty, that will give you a ton of Wrenches (the base upgrade currency). That was faster than me trying to get far on Hard which has increased wrench rewards. My other complaint is that the levels are samey, especially the last bunch ||Haven City, District 13, and the last one|| but thats probably just a me issue cause I've been playing this game for 60 some hours.

1. Shown stats are a bit obscure. You cannot see the resulting power that perks and items give you. I think the game would benefit a lot from another info tab with the whole player state

2. For some reason the whole game runs fine except the Haven city level. There I encounter huge FPS drops (144 -> 40)

3. Feels like the game wasn't designed for melee builds. Yes, you have perks and melee weapons and abilities, but it sometimes feels like the game wasn't really designed for melee playthroughs. Grappling hooks adds a ton of power for close combat though

EDIT 2: Actually, forget it, I'm now perfecting the achievement list and what I said here was kinda skill issue, melee is fine, but give it some time... and the grappling hook (unlock all 6 crystals and the orange zone in the city)

4. MP works fine but here and there we encountered small desyncs like the other's nickname was randomly replaced with the ID, or our max HP wasn't shown correctly, or shooting angle was wrong, etc",1657477255,1706208313,True,6,0,0.580418586730957031,0,True,False,True

Hard to believe it isn't a much more popular game. Visuals, audio, soundtrack, movement, combat, items, perks, and weapons are all top-notch. I favor a few classes heavily over others, but even the ones I don't use often are still fun. Roboquest is a rogue-lite, but the FPS elements are just as important as the classes and builds. There is room for error in choosing your upgrades if you can make up for it with raw skill. Your choices of perks, items, and weapons nonetheless make a massive difference. The range of options in that respect is wide enough to allow for multiple effective builds within each class. Your choices will be influenced by chance, too, as you'll have a very limited selection each time you choose an item, weapon, or perk. Weapons are sometimes dropped by enemies, and you can upgrade them by simply finding them later in the game or by paying an NPC with power cells (also dropped by enemies) to upgrade one you already have. There are more enemies than I'll ever care to remember, and even the first 3 of the 4 boss fights can feature different bosses with their own unique attacks. Even the boss arenas differ in terms of their mechanics. I have nothing negative to say about any of the boss fights, either. They vary in difficulty, but there isn't one that makes me want to restart my run. Much like the art style, the weapon system is reminiscent of Borderlands. Though the game can be completed in a 30-40 minute run by many players, the replay value is incredible. Playing through numerous times will allow players to progressively collect more and more wrenches, which are used to buy permanent upgrades. Enemies occasionally drop these upon death throughout runs. Additionally, finding secrets and competing challenges is strongly encouraged by rewarding the player with optional, but very helpful gadgets, which are also permanent. If you want to beat the hardest of SEVEN difficulties, you'd better get those gadgets and spend those wrenches first. Each run is divided into levels, but some levels have multiple exits which change the following levels you play through, though the last few are always the same. Exploring multiple paths through the game is necessary to unlock important items. You only get one life per run, and since runs can be more than half an hour, it's best to start on an easier difficulty and work your way up as you replay over and over while unlocking and learning things. Jumping into hard mode with no upgrades is exceptionally unforgiving, but working your way up is easily worth it. You might want to punch your monitor when you choke a run on the last level, but it's hard to deny how amazing Roboquest is. 100 hours in and I just got my first S-rank and completion on the hardest difficulty in the same run. Now it's just a matter of beating my times, trying out different builds, and finding and unlocking what little I haven't already.

I don't know how or why but the cadence of the music really fits well with the gameplay and sort of makes me play ""in-rhythm"".

In relation to other games, Deadlink comes to mind, I think this has a better implementation of roguelite elements. The buffs/perks could be felt in gameplay and most if not all the available options really made me play differently and/or influence my future decisions in picking the next perk or gun.

The game has build variety and randomization that is well executed and reminds me of Binding of Isaac. That feeling of trying to make the most of what the RNG gave you but still giving enough options that you're not fully at the mercy of RNG.

TL:DR - The artstyle is great, the sound mixing is really good, the soundtrack is awesome, the gunplay is so nice, the gameplay is amazing and it has so much replayability. Easily one of my favorite roguelikes I've ever played. Try the demo!

I believe the price tag is absolutely worth it. Sure, there are a few areas I dislike, like (spoilers) [spoiler]The Rift is a pain, with barely enough time and no margin for error. (on Hard) and the worst part of it all is that your run ends if you don't make it to the end of the level in time.[/spoiler], [spoiler]Doom Gardens is kind of the same, but has a bit more room for mistakes. Prepare accordingly.[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Duke Nuker was a super obnoxious boss as it felt nearly impossible to beat until I unlocked more items.[/spoiler], but neither of those ruined the game for me. They're really easy to avoid if you aren't ready/don't want to deal with them and can be little to no problem if you prepare accordingly and have the right items. [spoiler]The Rift still sucks though.[/spoiler] 

If you're interested at all, then please try the demo. It's free and it's really fun. It lets you play through the first 2 levels as many times as you'd like and you can unlock 3 (maybe 4) out of the 6 character classes in the demo. And if you think the demo has a ton of replayability then the game will pleasantly surprise you as it has WAY more content than I expected it to. (and it's still getting more updated! There's a roadmap available if you're curious.)

[list]
[*]The speed of combat is incredibly satisfying and tricky to master.
[*]The different Robo powers really spice up the gameplay to have you try out different approaches to getting through the levels.
[*]Weapon variety also adds a ton to each run as you'll have to work with what you're given, adapting your play to the kinds of weapons you've selected.
[*]Grades/rewards for speed and XP give solid incentive to be as quick and efficient as possible in each level.
[*]World environments change up every other level or so, helping to insure a diverse set of enemies and challenges.
[*]OST is heavy and awesome. Also is dynamic and ramps up when you enter/leave combat which enhances the game's peaks and valleys of action.

Edit 1/21/24: After 10 hours and finally unlocking Elementalist my final conclusion to this game is a big whopping W because of the fast paced shooting and the gun. The best gun in my opinion in this game would be any of the sniper (atleast uncommon and tier 3 - 5) and that's all for now I'll try to update this if I find anything new other than the shovel and unlocking most of the perks.

Edit 1/22/24: Just learned that there will be no mod support which sucks because mod's would make the game more fun, since it get's repetitive fast. But it still enjoy the game as of rn.

 - Fast paced shooting
 - almost 100 unique weapons
 - Collectables
 - Upgrades
 - Good AI
 - Actually challenges the player by forcing you to move
 - Co-op Online
 - Different classes, abilities that are all balanced very well

I got this game initially for my partner and I because she is a huge borderlands fan. This game and Gunfire Reborn were the only two that people said online scratched that looter shooter itch. We played Gunfire Reborn quite a bit and found it to be pretty fun, but a few things always irked me personally when we got into a run. The main thing that frustrated me was that attention was always split between the dozens of weapons dropping all over the place, and since you can't hold anything besides what you have equipped the pace of the level would always slow down to a snails pace as everyone had to stop at each arena to look at the weapons. 

Roboquest in comparison has a timer, with small rewards tied to how fast you go on each stage. It's not enough to frustrate if you can't quite meet the S rank, but it does give that little reward for you to take risks and keep runs quick. The game balances that with many spaces designed as hubs where the timer pauses and you can spend some time really figuring out your build. Almost all of your weapons and upgrades are here in these little safe places. This means when you need to level up, pick a weapon and/or item, you're doing it in one place and can know if you'll have what you need to make that synergy work. It seems to make those decisions happen faster while preserving this flow between different combat encounters in a level. If not for all that, I don't think most players would grind on railings and rocket jump as much, and that would be really tragic.

If that doesn't interest you, I'll have you know, even non-explosive weaponry can get the rocket jump ability and fairly early on you can reliably acquire an orange quality shovel with the ability. Beating enemies to death with a unique shovel before rocket jumping away makes you feel like a superhero. And its just a tiny slice of this game.",1705943761,1705943761,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It combines the cartoon/comic-book aesthetic of Borderlands as well as its RPG mechanics and ""out there"" weaponry with unique firing modes and alt-fires with DOOM's more finetuned action combat, where being quick on your feet and quick to defeat enemies are what win the day.

The roguelike aspect mainly comes from what weapons show up in your runs, or what perks you get as you level up. The stages themselves do not change, allowing you to refine your playthrough with each death, as well as keep track of each sidequest and secret to come back to it later without much concern. It's easy to fumble the tightrope of action fps gameplay with rpg mechanics; very often you end up unloading untold amounts of ammunition into enemies while they can cleave a third of your health with a single stray, but Roboquest does a far better job than most in balancing them.",1624277549,1705937441,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Roboquest is an FPS-meets-Roguelike, with just a dash of the good parts of Borderland's and Destiny's random weapon generation.

Tight, fast paced movement - especially with everything unlocked - makes the game a moment to moment joy. You're rewarded for getting inclose with headbonks, the ability to bounce off an enemy's head and do extra damage. Add in a wonderful array of guns, all of whom feel wonderful to shoot by base, and excellent class design - six of them, all with reasons why you'd want to play them, and it's just a joy.

My one big criticism is the game does use a meta progression system, which i'm not a fan of. Thankfully, as these things go it's not that grindy to get everything unlocked, and the exploration aspects are rewarding. Still, it's a sour point for me - your mileage may vary. 

It's also tough as hell - Even experienced FPS vets like myself will benefit from dropping the difficulty initially, and working your way up. But once you get rolling... oh my!

A looter-shooter rogue lite with cooldown abilities sounds like a nightmare but for some reason this exact combination fixes all the problems i have with both looter-shooters and with rogue likes/lites. 

The biggest problem a looter-shooter has is the fact that, if you dont find a good weapon, enemies usually sponge up and it becomes a drag to play. The biggest problem of the rogue like/lite games is usually that starting from point zero is pretty boring, especially if you did it for a few times.

So why does Roboquest have neither of these problems? Because the rogue lite nature of the game allows it to give you way more powerful guns than a looter shooter, since farming isnt really a thing. And the rogue lite problem of starting at point zero? Also not a problem since the core combat is a fast paced almost arena shooter like experience where even the movement is fun. The last part that i usually would have a problem with are cooldown abilities, but since the cd is pretty low on most of them it feels like a nessasity to have something that does reliable damage without being overpowered where weapons wouldnt matter anymore.

Thats of course just the surface of the game, with unlockable classes and and a ton-load of weapons with different affixes to find, as well as the super fun passives you get on level up which can completely change how you play the game. The time a run usually takes feels pretty solid as well, with usually 30mins to an hour its a perfect game to jump in, have fun for a while and then do something else.

Right now the game feels like a hidden gem, and with the right support from the devs it has the potential to become a cult classic, highliy recommended",1705874311,1705874311,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Strong mobility with slides, bhopping and rocket jumping. A decent selection of class types, all with two unique abilities and their own pools of perks to improve and evolve them.

Average runtime for me so far has been 25-30 minutes to beat the final boss on standard difficulty. So it's not so long you get frustrated from dying, but not so short that your progression feels useless during a run.

Only real issue is that weapon scaling feels too low near the last few levels. Class abilities start to FAR out do any damage you can do with a weapon, even with 'optimised' affixes. Ranger's Javelin, Elementalist's Trinity and Comet and Commando's Shorty do so much damage that any regular weapon pales in comparison.

What I enjoyed:
Full key rebinding for ESDF players like myself. 
Performance is good on my rig with 4 year old equipment.

Very nice to weave around the arena shooting robots and destroying them.
Finding secrets is fun and something to look forward to, that also makes your future runs more interesting as it opens up more options for acquiring gear and different paths you can take, like Dead Cells.
The soundtrack is very nice. I already like electronic music, and the Cyberpunk/Dark Electro/EBM/DnB music adds to the frantic nature of combat.
Adding on to that, the combat does have moments where I feel stressed due to the difficulty and relieved when I escape the combat encounter alive. 
Switching weapons is fun as your non-equipped weapon reloads automatically while you have the other weapon out. This means that you spend more time shooting and dealing damage instead of reloading and getting caught.
The weapons themselves have interesting designs and feel very nice to shoot. Though not all the weapons are ""lips out"" good, there are some that are. 

What I don't like:
Shooting enemies doesn't really have feedback besides flashing white and your gun's effects. 
Enemies don't really react to most gunshots as in there isn't any sort of visual damage or sparking effects. Sure there is an ice overlay when you do enough cryo damage or burn damage, but nothing for normal shots unless you stagger them with a big weapon.
Ragdolls and bits happen for big enemies, but smaller/normal sized ones just disappear and in a puff when they die.
Once you crest the progression hill into the ""Endgame"" it feels a little same-y from run to run. This is where I will compare the game to the only other Roguelike FPS I have: Gunfire Reborn.
I do have 341 hours in-game (steam hours include afk and menu time) on GFR and while the game has its problems, I would say GFR is a Roguelike FPS while Roboquest is an FPS Roguelike.
While Roboquest has better shooting and movement mechanics, GFR leans way more (maybe too much) into the roguelike elements that allow your runs to be consistently OP broken screen melting strong. There are more opportunities in GFR to have weird, strong, and playstyle defining interactions between weapons and your character. Roboquest leans a lot more on your personal aiming skill to make your run. Granted, there are some broken classes like Engineer with broken elemental interactions but they do not feel the same level of OPness as certain combos in GFR.
Part of this is due to weapon affixes in RQ as they don't have crazy affixes that drastically change the weapon and how it interacts with other parts of your run. Extra firerate, reload speed, less movement speed penalty for heavy weapons, etc means that run-to-run the SMG will feel the same as it did 5 runs ago because the affixes do not change a lot.

I still enjoyed my time with this game and plan to keep playing in the future. RQ has a lot of potential and I do recommend for players who love shooting games with a little bit of roguelike sprinkling in them.

EDIT: Some of my cons were my own inexperience with the game. There is an enemy stagger mechanic, but only with certain weapon types and affixes. There is more depth to perk synergy than I previously thought, and it can affect your build and weapon choice as well. 1.1 update was a welcome addition to the game. I still highly recommend this game if you enjoy this genre.",1700236665,1705829536,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Excellent handling, fast and enjoyable combat.
I don't get other reviews that say there isn't enough perk variety - depending on the level-up choices runs with the same class can be wildly different.

Difficulty curves can feel a bit steep and iffy at times, especially when you are starting out and lack workshop (think: permanent) upgrades - there's a big jump in difficulty when you first enter the Fields map and some later bosses feel a tad too hard compared to the map they are in - but that might only be a me thing. Also, getting gadgets unlocked will help massively with movement which in turn helps to avoid damage.

Furthermore, it's a bit hard to increase things like movement speed or armor by getting items and most of the corrupted items seem to always be a bad idea to get.

Try the demo, and if you like it, then the full game will resume you right where you left off (even if you uninstall the demo beforehand). This game is genuinely pretty groundbreaking in what it does and how well it does it.

I bought it for 25% off at 18.74 USD

EDIT: at around 15 hours I finally found my first legendary weapon. This game's loot economy is honestly great. I hated it in Borderlands 3 when they gave you a legendary 20 minutes into the game for checking a vending machine, and then by the midgame your inventory is exclusively legendaries and it muddies the waters and robs the player of excitement. As Syndrome once said, ""If everyone's super, no one is."" And if all of my loot is legendary, then none of it is.

I also got to the final boss (and died), and the game's difficulty really ramps up towards the end (rightfully so). It feels great to play on hard mode, I strongly recommend it if you can handle it. The game really fits the bill for chaotic mouse+keyboard movement shooter fun. It also lets you snipe or shoot a bow or crossbow from afar.

I will say the player characters are pretty unbalanced. The invincibility character and ranger have such better surviveability and I can't get far with any other characters.",1705048651,1705736115,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Maybe the other character classes fix these problems, but the beginner class doesn't make me want to play more.

This game is by far, one of the best video game I ever played.
It's a fast-paced FPS combat, not only it offer guns, it also offers melee weapons that can make the playstyle a lot more interesting. The music is a banger, weapons are fun, classes makes it more fun and above all else, the community is nice :)

If you like Doom but also like rogue-lite elements, then this game, is made for you. Explorations included btw :)
Personally, I always find this game feels like an arcade too. It doesnt make me go too serious playing it, and neither how much time I failed, it doesnt make me frustrated to it(its probably because I have a mindset to stay calm even playing fast-paced combat games) but still, the main point is, it really feels like the vibe playing an arcade machine",1705717308,1705717308,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The music is PHENOMENAL, Noisecream really made an OST of exclusively bangers. Definitely listen to their work both from roboquest and from their back catalogue! Can't recommend it enough. Favourite track is probably ""Entropy"". 

The movement and gunplay is fantastic, I find myself entering a ""flow state"" very easily regardless of what weapon or build I have at the time. The abilities, weapons, movement and especially the headbonking mechanic (think bouncing off a goomba) all meld together to where I feel like I don't have to even think about how I traverse or what target I prioritise, my brain and body just somehow know. Sound design on the guns and abilities is also great, meaning I can focus a lot on the action and know when abilities have recharged, when I killed an enemy with a critical hit, etc. If I could ask for anything more on the sound design, it'd just be a more distinct sound for your main ability so when it recharges it cuts through the rest of the audio to make sure you can hear it well, sometimes I can't hear the sound effect all that well and forget my ability is up. 

The visuals are great! I love the comic book style, the silhouettes are great for an action game, the onomatopoeia is a FANTASTIC touch, and animations are great all around! I prefer more stylized games to realism, so roboquest is exactly the kind of commitment to a striking style that I want in a game. 

Runs take about 35-50 minutes, 25 if you're really blazing through, which I found to be perfect! Although I am hoping there will be an update with some kind of post-final boss extension (a la voidling in risk of rain 2) so I can really test a build against an unreasonably hard challenge if it just blasted through the game. I find there's few builds in this game that allow me to effortlessly clean house, but it would be cool to have a fight tough enough to see how far they can really get pushed. 

And on the topic of builds, I love the perk system in this game! There's a few basic stat boost perks, and then you can collect up to 4 main perks, each having 2 sub perks. Most of the time I found that choosing my 4 main perks and maxing out on sub perks before picking up stat boosts was the way to go, but I'm starting to experiment with leaving some sub perks behind to focus on stat buffs. Hopefully either new skills are introduced or more synergies will be added later, excited to see how they develop :)

Overall Roboquest is absolutely a buy, deluxe edition and all, it's the most fun I've had with a roguelike since Risk of Rain 2! Lovely devs, super well thought out gameplay loop, pretty pictures, banger music, and coop is cross platform and pretty great! Seriously consider buying at any price, support these devs! They're putting something amazing into the indie scene and I'm very happy to be a customer of theirs :)

The amount of power required to run the game is insane for what it is. The game is only about 4.35gb and it requires easily double what it takes to run a game like Call of Duty. That's not a good look fellas. You're an indie studio, the vast majority of players are running sub-optimal machines. When the game crashes, it doesn't just crash the game, it crashes the whole bloody computer. Full shutdown. If you're running anything less than a 4000 series GPU and an i9, steer clear of this one. I've also got about 48gb of RAM and still getting issues. I've tried several times to share my feedback over on the discord, but either the Devs don't care, or they can't deign to respond to lowly customers. Either way, be sure you have a lights out PC or make sure they've updated since this review to alleviate this issue.

Seems the crashes have resolved, but when I returned to try again, I got stuck in the environment on the first run. I've posted the issues to the discord and attempted to explain issues before, but each time I get verbally assaulted by other users who are more than happy to curse out people highlighting faults in favor of patting the devs on the back and driving honest feedback from their community.

I have no wish to replay it, ever.

While weapons with their affixes are fun to try for once, it quickly becomes the understanding of what is vastly outperforming out of the pool. Rerolling affixes seems weird, since most of them are so generic, it never changes the gameplay at all.

Barely any upgrades through out the run that get to stack resulting in whacky/funny interactions. Just a dps check. Who cares what element you are or how often you proc miserable bonus perks, when it is just crit chance + crit damage check.

Maps are lame-ish. WHile it says they are randomly generated, that is basically Warframe's approach with segments of maps, premade chunks to connect to each other. They all feel the same, and end game stages basically the same. City, corrupted city, moon arenas. Considering that the run is 20-35 minutes depending on the wish to skip some xp along the way, that is half an hour restarting same room 40 times to then nuke it with bullet sponge bosses sprinkled along the way.

Purple-corrupted rooms and bosses change drastically after unlocking jetpack and grappling hook. Suddenly, most of the damage can be avoided by simply pressing E on a wall.

>>>

Doing new run seems like forcing myself to try clunky approaches with weapons/perks just for the sake of it. I am not upset when the run ended, since fun ended. I am happy when the run ended, since I get to turn that off.

Also, for some weird reasons it doesn't save the runs mid-progress? Not sure if that's just my problem, but that is just weird.

The movement and gunplay in RoboQuest feel so extremely good and are so satisfying, the game would even be fun without the roguelite structure around it - I could spend hours playing this as a single-room arcade high-score-hunting game. This is what makes the game really work; the moment-to-moment gameplay is just so fluid and smooth.

The roguelite elements definitely build on and add to it. Don't expect crazy builds like in Isaac - the weapons and perks you'll find are quite tame. There are definitely synergies, but the build meta never extends a lot beyond ""I picked a good perk for explosives, so I'll stick to an explosive weapon and other explosives-related perks"". This also means that your chances of success don't depend that much on your build, but more on learning the enemies and environments, which I really appreciate. Beating an area for the first time makes you feel like you're really getting the hang of it, rather than just having gotten lucky with RNG.

Be aware that - as far as my experience goes - you can't save mid-run. The game doesn't make this very clear, but quitting and restarting the game places you back at the hub area. Runs take between 15-45min, so it's good to plan in enough time to finish a session.

I see the dev enabled the ability to carry over the wrenches you had pre-version 1.0 release - thanks guys. Back to Recommend!

Bosses are challenging but not impossible, the different classes gives a great change in pace to the game. The random weapon spawns and unique effects and class modifiers as well as the choice of paths to take on each run means that you will never have the same experience each run is unique and fun.

Apart from the ability to buy passive upgrades your own skills improve with each run.  You start to pick up on strategies with weapons and combos that work well for your play style.

I believe the genre term that's catching on is 'roguelite arena shooter'. It combines the room-clearing stage progression of roguelites like Hades and Gungeon with the fast-paced FPS kicks of games like the ones I mentioned above. So imagine if Hades were a first person shooter, or ULTRAKILL was a roguelite. That's what Roboquest is going for. If you've played and loved games like Deadlink or Voidborn then you know it's a very compelling combination, and Roboquest hits the target dead center.

The main ingredients are all here. Weapons feel great to use, the many types and affixes make trying new stuff attractive and important, the different classes all feel unique and effective in their own ways, the movement and gunplay is top notch. It's hitting all of the expected parts in spades. You can headbonk enemies like Mario, rocket jump like Quake, and grind on rails for speed boosts like it's a Tony Hawk Pro Skater game.

But I think what I really like about this particular game is how meta progression is done. There is - of course - the currency-based meta progression; you accrue 'wrenches' during runs that you can spend between runs to acquire various upgrades like increased levels and rarities of drops, better offering from the NPCs in safe rooms, starting the run with extra powerups - the typical offerings. This makes every run feel impactful in *some* way, even if you do terribly or don't dabble in any of the other things I'm about to get into.

But there are multiple OTHER layers of meta progression, and all of the ones outside of the wrenches require you to complete certain objectives in the runs themselves. The game immediately makes it clear that there are multiple routes and side stages you can try to clear (that are usually a lot harder). Across and between these stages you can uncover various secrets that culminate in extra permanent ingame boosts for your character to make future runs easier and more varied. And these secrets take many forms, from unlocking doors to open up permanent reward rooms / extra routes, simple collectibles you pick up to get a permanent reward after so many finds, to clearing entire sub-routes to acquire a unique ability, or fulfilling quests for various NPCs so they help you out in the future.

It's rather comprehensive, and a very fun extra layer of gameplay that I don't think has been so well done in other games of its type. Some of the 'puzzles' are fairly straightforward and simple to clear for their goodies, but others require some thought, or thorough exploration of the game's many stages to figure out the solution. I love it, and want to do them all.",1705559202,1705559393,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

No harm is done, no feelings hurt,
Just bolts and nuts, and a bit of dirt.

My buddy and I have weekends a couple times a year where we meet up and play video games for an entire weekend.

We put 30 hours into the game in 1 weekend, most games we get about half that in a weekend. We were non stop playing, as soon as we would lose, we'd start back up again, trying to figure out what we needed to do to get further than last time. This game is amazing, it's entertaining the entire time you're playing. We were blown away by the amount of quality of life things in the game. We were blown away that perks like the jet pack were one of the best jet packs I've used in a game. The guns are all so fun. The enemies make sense. The bosses are a healthy challenge. Over and over we were blown away.

This game is everything I have wanted out of the looter shooter and movement shooter genre forever.

Every gun has a lot of impact, every class feels fun and different, it's absolutely wonderful.
I think the only thing possibly holding Roboquest back is the caps (movement speed and armor have relatively low caps, highest difficulty is hard, abilities have relatively tame scaling). Truth be told, this game needs to embrace being broken in half. Higher difficulties, higher caps, difficulty-ramping items and modifiers along, just make shit go wild. Add nukes!

It captures the high-speed gameplay and fun gimmicks of movement shooters while also offering a wide variety of guns to play around with. Your character's progression within a run offers a healthy splash of variety too; I generally don't feel pigeonholed into specific strategies but I'm often tempted to try something different or new. Sometimes because a strategy seems strong, but most often just because I'm excited to see how it'll play out. The game's core - movement and gunplay - is rock solid and it makes exploring every facet of gameplay a joy.

The demo's a great way to test the core mechanics out and check the netplay with your pal. Play through a couple of zones and try out a boss fight! It's worth noting that the game's much more expansive than the demo (a full playthrough can take around an hour or so) and features significantly more weapon and enemy(!) variety.

I had some concern after a string of demo playthroughs that the game might grow stale, but there's plenty to discover in the full game, don't worry!

This game is boring! Boring!!! You stand, and you shoot, and that's literally it! I can feel my eyelids getting heavy playing this game; it requires no interesting movement, planning, or strategy whatsoever. You camp one weapon, click your left mouse button 20 or 30 times, and then proceed to the next zone. Weapons feel (and sound) like they're made of tin cans, enemy design is painfully generic, and environmental design is completely forgettable. RQ feels cheap, stiff, and lacking in personality. And no, adding some ""pow"" text when you shoot a gun doesn't count as personality when the maps are the equivalent of dollar-store Borderlands levels from 2009.

Compared to Deadlink, the action, mobility, and weapon impact of RQ are laughable. Compared to Gunfire Reborn, buildcraft and weapon generation are hilariously shallow. RoboQuest is worse than these games --and I'm not exaggerating-- in EVERY respect. I genuinely cannot think of a reason why you would play RQ over either of those two titles. RQ does nothing better and everything worse. 

If you want to play a roguelite FPS, I urge you to play one of those games instead. If you want highly mobile, hair-trigger, DOOM-style adrenaline, play Deadlink. If you want deep buildcraft, character action, and Borderlands-style looting, play Gunfire Reborn. RQ isn't worth your money. I don't even think it's worth your time -- I wouldn't play this game even if it were free. It's that dull! 

I am refunding this game right now. Buyer beware!",1705454813,1705454813,False,4,0,0.423382043838500977,0,True,False,False

- Finishing run on higher difficulties may rely on unlocking gadgets/perks from multiple playthrough.

I started playing this in early access and now it having a full on release I an extremely happy with the process/development to this point.

Roboquest really plays with its variety of multiple genres but gives us viability that even allows you to play it as a boom shooter, arena, or a typical run n gun some sense, with its enemies constantly blazing your with ammo like a bullet hell. Roboquest is a punishing game with everything you do being calculated after multiple runs to even its multiplayer expanding on creating in sync teamwork towards advancing to the next level, sometimes its level design is a lil bit overcrowded or lack of even walls to go behind it still allows you and your fellow friend to work together in stopping the robots of this world. The music is bumpy and the color is cute, playing on an overwatch/borderlands aesthetic. I would say that this game isn't meant for everyone but if you do pick up this game itll be a worth while.

Rate: 8.5 out of 10

-Ez to pick up, difficult to master.
-Smooth af gun play.
-Fast like Doom/Quake
-Looks like Gunfire Reborn/Borderlands
-Many gun reticles look/feel like Overwatch.
-6 classes to choose from (they each have a couple of skills and a passive like Apex/Overwatch)
-Common (maybe 1 gimmick to overcome), Goliath/Elite (2 gimmicks), and Boss enemies (many gimmicks)

I will say the bosses do get a bit ridiculous. I'm playing on Hard (hardest difficulty) so take that into account. Starting off it's just circling some idiot robot who will never hit you. Then suddenly it's like, oh the floor is lava and the boss is on a giant looping rail and laying mines on the rail so you have to dodge the mines + lasers while also shooting the boss. Or it's a giant brawler guy who runs up to you to try and punch you, then IMMEDIATELY after missing a punch, launches a stun grenade in your face, followed up by punching you again and nuking half your health bar. Or it's a big guy on a giant wall rail climbing up a tower while the floor is rising lava, so you have to climb the tower with it while also dodging fire. And if you don't kill him fast enough then you only get a tiny tiny platform to work with. Good luck doing that one without any of the jump/jetpack upgrades.

Overall, it's fun, but can be slightly frustrating to consistently lose to the final boss because it's just not practical to dodge all the crap it throws at you.

Edit: Oh yeah, there's currently not any way to save your current run. So if your game crashes or you need to exit the game mid-run, back to the start for you. But they're supposedly working on it.

Neither me, nor the two people I've played with have ever had any issues staying connected. Those making negative reviews based on their own crappy internet, should be disregarded.
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------

Yes! I love this game. The gunplay and gameplay is top notch, 0% clunky, 100% zoom. Fast paced, kill to live type combat. My only complaint is how short it is and how much easier it is in Co-op. Took me dozens of tries to beat on my own, but playing with a friend on his first time, we very nearly beat it first shot.

Love the weapons for the most part and there are enough that it doesn't get boring, but more guns is always a plus.

More levels.

More enemies.

More rewards for beating higher difficulties.

Is it possible to have a mode like Diablo 3 rifts in which you keep your gear or find better versions of the same, and make them upgradeable?

HOLY HELL THE MUSIC. tracks go unbelievably hard and ive added a majority of them to my library, they match the environments theyre placed in perfectly, and (maybe its just my schizo brain) have beats that consistently line up with gunshots and gameplay like its metal hellsinger without the player putting in effort. 

The inspiration in gameplay cannot be narrowed down to even a single genre, as there are clear bits of borderlands, ultrakill, hades, overwatch, furi, and many many more titles. This is not a bad thing in the slightest as the devs use this inspiration how it should be, as inspiration for their own unique concepts. Gameplay is fast but not as fast as others you may be used to, and the rougelike systems (while maybe taking a bit to start to roll out) are very in depth and can allow for some very different builds with the class system. There are so many different guns that come with so many different perks and attachments that may seem overbearing but are actually very accessible if you just use your eyeballs. 

For a 25 dollar game there is a ton of replayability even outside of a normal run (which if in-depth enough can come out to almost an hour per full run) with power crystals, a basecamp to upgrade, secrets to find in literally every area, challenge rifts, and a ton of more content to come if you look at the roadmap on their discord. (im excited for this damn game, its so cool.) Plus, its got coop. Yeah its only two players, but ITS GOT CROSSPLAY COOP. Get this game. 

Story, while simple and maybe a little childish, is still fun to watch through the beautifully done cutscenes that take place in this surprisingly stunning world. The little girl companion makes for a good figure to see the world through (since you play as a cold hunk of steel) and can honestly be pretty motivating with her mid-run checkpoint dialogue during a tense run if you arent a cold dead asshole. A plot revolving around an evil AI in 2023 may be a little contrived but i dont think it would drop the game any points at all. Turn your brain off to the stylish robot mayhem in the cutscenes and enjoy, we both know you arent here for a super in depth narrative.

Positive: 
- Fluid, satisfying and fast-paced gameplay
- Fantastic variety in weapons, classes and playstyles
- Great replayability
- Good amount of different levels with plenty of variety
- Great audio and visual design
- Abundance of upgrades, secrets and collectables with well-paced progression
- Charming NPC design

Negative:

- Story is basic and fairly forgettable
- Random generation within individual levels is fine but not great
- Inability to save midrun (the developers have mentioned in an announcement that this will be addressed in an upcoming update)

Game strikes good balance between being (relatively) hard on standard difficulty, but giving the Player a senso of progression. As with most roguelites - it's difficult to separate progression in terms of skill vs progression resulting from unlocked (persistent) classes, skills & upgrades. No matter - IT JUST WORKS.

Movement is swift & very responsive. If You hit a rock or a ledge - 99% it's just Your fault and You will get better. Gunplay is amazing - most guns feel different but satisfactory. What's important - the variety supports different builds & playstyles. One can go for critical dmg with sniper rifles, AOE mayhem with explosives, or any shades in between.

Skill classes are well thought through, with (most if not all) having either upgrade paths or good synergies with other skills and different weapon types (& playstyles).

The only thing some people may find jarring is music. Not that it's bad - but not everyone may enjoy this genre (check gameplays on YT).

Let me get this out of the way, its a [b]good game no doubt[/b]. Game mechanic wise, gameplay, its there. Story, errrr.... dont know much about it or dont care about it enough.

Now, why do I give it a negative review but said its a good game. My problem of the game lies with its locked progression. To put it simply, [b] a lot of perks ( like jet pack and etc ) + character classes are locked behind very difficult hidden secrets [/b] to the point that either you have to look through a Youtube guide or do at least 60hrs runs to unlock it. And because you are trying to unlock the perks and classes, you either spend 60hrs+ on it OR you put it under the easiest settings and just run through the game multiple times ( which dampens the entire mood of the game because you are just speedrunning everything to get everything ). You might be asking ""Just do a 60hrs run then and unlock it slowly?"". Yes, you are right, but also what's the point of doing multiple runs with not having the full experience of the perks & classes. Why do I have to play ""said hidden class character"" after 60hrs in because for some reason, its locked behind some hidden secret stuffs. 

The other problem I have with the game is that the music is uhh boring. Thats more or less it. Listening to it after the 10th time, I just mute the audio because it isnt that good. It's not Persona 5 level good, its not Hades level good. It's just average, and average is bad for a game you have to play 10+ hrs in. Yes, everyone has their own taste and preference but you have to make a music universally good though and this isnt. 

Basically, to sum it up, [b] I'm missing out the full experience of the game because some important stuffs are hidden therefore I am forced to brute force it by playing it on the easiest settings by watching Youtube guide which ruin my experience of the game because I expected a difficult game as its a roguelite game but I'm playing on the easiest to unlock everything first. And the music sux [/b].

[b]My idea on how to reworked this[/b]

Make all the guns slowly unlocked by a leveling system. That way, players are more keen to play more and more to unlocked more potential weapons. Then add some in game bonus where if you want a particular weapon, you can ""buy"" it. [b]THIS IS NOT A MICRO-TRANSACTION IDEA[/b]. This idea is to give players to pick weapons they prefer and also allows players to quickly complete the entire weapon catalog. 

The perks and classes should honestly be an achievement thing, i.e beat this boss to unlock this perks and classes, not HIDDEN behind some hidden room that you need to run 5 times to get what you need. 

Also pls have a guide map as to which room leads to which bosses and stuffs. I think the crystal idea is okay but you need some sort of map to indicate which rooms leads to which crystal and stuffs. Kinda wasteful to create a mini boss, only to fight it once or twice because its not the easiest way to reach that mini boss. You want to create areas that gives the player a reason to reach there like how Dead Cells does it ( for example in Dead Cells, picking poison swamp area to get better areas later or village area to play safer ). 

Atm now, I just dont have any motivation to play the game. Still trying to unlock some stuffs....

Edit: Just writing my thoughts on how to simplified version of my complain. 

Imagine playing Hades. The choice given to you is that you can use [b]any God booms during any run[/b], which is great because you get to experiment stuffs. The other choice roguelite games can do is progression through achievement, i.e you get let say, Medusa boom, win the run, get Hercules boom, then win and get Athena and so-on. Robo-Quest does it like this: Do you want to play Athena? Welp you cant because you have to go to room H which only can get by doing room A to C in a hidden behind wall in room C to get you to room G which only opens up if you have room B key which if you found out the password key in room F. If you dont find this [i] inconvenient [/i]. you have the patience of a tortoise ",1704811625,1705236984,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story while optional is nice, the enemy design is COOL. there is one Boss who's gimmick is [spoiler] being on rails and you can either follow him on the monorail track dodging bombs but hitting his weak points or shoot from afar while in a more secure position (still dodging his attacks) and more!

I really like the easy difficulty option, some migh like the grind and you do even get extra rewards on hard but for many roguelite you either sink 10+ hours doing so many runs and raking enough upgrades to proceed or you'll just abandon the game if you're not very skilled. which is a shame. if you feel you're the kind of player who usually quits halfway tru roguelites the easy mode can give you a lift to get enough upgrades to feel comfortable attempting an entire run in Normal without wasting too much time. and also experimenting the different Class if some feels more difficult (the melee one for example)",1705023000,1705229029,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

""Take an existing genre and make it a roguelite"" is a risky proposition these days, where not every developer knows how to design a run-based game that has the tight gameplay of its inspiration *and* is balanced well for difficulty. Roboquest leans more towards the Hades end of being theoretically possible without upgrades, but you'll probably need them to get through in your first 10 hours of play.

Even though I kept hitting a roadblock in the second major area though, I was really hooked on this one. It's all the kineticism of Doom Eternal where you're just burning through enemies while managing major threats on the battlefield. It even has a similar mechanic that motivates you to be close to enemies when you take them out.

While it limits you to only 2 weapons at a given time, it still has the variety of Doom-inspired weaponry to keep runs feeling fresh. Every class has distinct builds that can make you feel crazy powerful by the end of a run if you set up the right synergies. In all the time I spent trying to clear this game on the Hard difficulty, I never felt like a build was *so* good that I basically cheated the game. It's still wicked fast-paced and extremely punishing.

The story and presentation is refreshingly humble. There's just enough there to be charming, but it knows you wanna get to rip-and-tearing ASAP so it never gets in your way. And holy hell, the music kicks ass. It gets progressively more intense as you progress forward, to the point of Roller Mobster levels of BPM by the end.

This is one of the best modern roguelites out there, and sits right next to Cobalt Core for being one of the best in 2023. Big recommend on this one if you love movement shooters like Doom Eternal or Ultrakill. Doubly so if you love rocket-jumping.",1705216822,1705216822,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

No robot is the same and they each have distinct abilities that actually pose a threat! You never once ever feel bored or have a walk in the park, its constant jumping, running, dashing, shielding and shooting. 

Game play: So many weapons with their variations and leveling up system it keeps everything fresh and you don't ever feel like you're too overpowered or the enemy is.

Level design: it is very pleasing and everything makes sense. The intended way of moving with Sprint, Air strafing, Rail riding, bunny hopping, the map all fits well and theres no moment where you feel that you hit an invisible wall or a small ledge.

Difficulty: Hard is exactly what it is stated as-HARD. The enemies are constantly firing at you, flying up and down, more aggressive but thats just how we experienced players love it. Dying over and over is a bit frustrating BUT we love that too as it brings satisfaction when we beat the level. Every time you play, new guns and new perks are randomly selected so if you found an ""OP"" setup, SIKE! Time to learn how to use with what you got!

Overall: 9/10

I had no clue it was even a thing until I went flipping through demos for something new to play, and then *bam* I get flashbanged by not only a game with a demo (already rare for a quality product) but a demo that had me hooked immediately with the basic gameplay loop.

Roboquest is *fun*. Fun for fun's sake. Take Doom, slap it over Isaac, make everything a rattletrap, and you're in business. The whole vibe is mildly plain, but it serves the gameplay perfectly. I don't need to be distracted by shiny chrome and junk while my entire goal is 'Shoot the bad things what might be trying to unalive you'. I just need bumpin' music and enough flash to keep me intrigued.

The fact that the game encourages speed once you've gotten good at it is nice, but the fact that it doesn't *demand* speed is even better. I'll always look more favorably on a game that encourages a style instead of demanding. It enables more people to approach that game. In this case, you lose out on upgrade materials..that you already eventually gain the ability to get multiple of, have handed to you on level up, and drop more and more commonly. Thanks to that you can decide whether to explore for rewards like data logs or even whole alternate routes through a stage.

Gunplay's brisk and snappy too. There are a few stinkers among the gun list, but there's enough dakka to satisfy an Ork between some of the MGs and the like, while there are enough scoped options to satisfy the snipers. Explosives, grenades, kunai and bows for the precision sorts. Shotguns for those that love mixing it up. And tons of affixes, alt fires, and more to boot. Passive upgrades can be sorta eh so far, but the core systems are strong enough that for once, passives (apart from leveling ones, gimme a moment for those) aren't as make or break as they are in some other games.

Classes and leveling though, oh boy. I still have to grab the last class, but three out of the four I've unlocked so far have been addicting. Engineer pulling floating sentry bots out that it can repair with the tap of a button, the Guardian's added impact and tank ability, and the Commando's sheer level of 'Fuck you' if you pick the right upgrades are all great. Nothing particularly feels lacking, but knowing how you're going to build is key when picking level up upgrades. Aaaaat least until you start getting access to perk rerolls, which comes fairly quickly *as well*.

The bottom line is honestly that I'd stack this up with the other high-end roguelites out there, and it's absolutely something worth looking at if you're in the middle of the Venn diagram of 'likes doom' and 'likes roguelites'.

The overall gameplay loop is pretty simple: collect/find weapons, raise your score through completing levels and killing enemies/bosses fast while synergizing your upgrades/perks to slay the final boss. 

Moment to moment combat is fast, punchy and extremely satisfying. Each weapon is unique in how they play; from rifles, shotguns, melee weapons, explosive launchers - you name it and it's probably here. These weapons also have random affixes that drastically change the strength and variety of each weapon you pick up. I think the best thing about this game is that most, if not all weapons feel exhilarating to use; combined with the satisfying sound and visual effects make combat extremely addictive. 

Enemy variety is solid - your typical more generic enemies in the game such as turrets and soldiers are present here but I didn't find any enemies that are a huge standout. Even the bosses, while are enjoyable to fight, are somewhat generic apart from the odd couple such as the robotic caterpillar that requires you to grind along a metal track. With this, the level variety is good too; with even some secret areas that I have less experience with - but in general, there is some choice in which path you can take at varying levels of difficulty and versatility. 

Roboquest really values how fast you can complete a run; which I personally think is a positive and a negative. It maintains the flow of the game but It forces you to kill as many enemies as possible while also knowing the fastest ways to get across a level and as such, the game punishes you (score-wise) for taking your time. It also has a meta-progression system that allows you to permanently upgrade your future runs that give you more opportunities to improve and more exciting weapons to drop.

The soundtrack is also incredible and suits the game perfectly - maybe the best soundtrack of the year. 

Overall, Roboquest is a game you shouldn't skip. Each run feels quite different to the last; with it's plethora of weapons, secrets, upgrades, perks, and classes (6 of them) constantly providing  rewarding and thrilling roguelike combat.",1705165561,1705165647,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly, I was a little conflicted about the 1.0 update when it first came out. Not because of the reset in progress in fact I liked that because it gave me a reason to keep grinding. I will state all the good things about the game first. New class is really fun to build and can be quite powerful. The first time I beat the game I used Elementalist. Weapon mastery is great! It now gives me an actual reason to try out all the weapons, and I have found I like a lot more of the weapons then I at first thought! Movement is slick tight and buttery smooth. Most weapons feel wonderful to use. Classes are also better balanced and I have found myself using classes I never even tried during EA. Achievements are all achievable with a little time.
AND THE MUSIC ABSOLUTELY ROCKS!!

Now onto the less good.
Weapon reload times need to be like twice as long. currently I can get away with using one weapon and I don't really like that since I would prefer a faster paced game play. Punishing reloads would help and encourage switching weapons. levels do get a little repetitive after a while so some changes need to be made there. needs to be a a few more rougelike elements to help the games longevity. 

My Wishlist: Ideas for the Devs
Reload changes: Let’s extend those reload times. Make us sweat a little. Encourage weapon switching. 
Endless Mode: A mode where wrenches unlock endless runs. 
idk what else. its a solid game that you should give a shot. download the demo so you can try it out without buying it! comment below any suggestions you have.

It's incredible hard to create satisfying and addictive second-to-second combat, but the developers of this game have done that. I couldn't really point to what makes the combat so thrilling, but it it IS exactly that. The last time I enjoyed combat this much was probably the Titanfall series, may it rest in peace. 

Does the game have flaws? Sure, all games do. I'm not deep enough in to see all the wrinkles. I haven't had a chance to try the co-op yet, though I have already begun harassing my friends to buy this game. I had to purchase it after playing several hours of the surprisingly generous demo. 

Video games don't pass the time for my jaded, divorced-dad ass like they once did. When a game like this manages to yank me out of the shadow realm and make me experience joy, I gotta give props where they are due.

Fans of Hades, the Risk of Rain series, and PvE shooters in general will have a lot of fun with this one. It personally scratches the same itch Killing Floor does, though the gameplay is much different.

Run through the levels taking out baddies with or without a friend, picking up new weapons and upgrades along the way. Plenty of secrets to look for as well, and pretty much all of them significantly improve your capabilities throughout the runs. You start with a basic double jump as your only additional mobility, but by the end I had many other options to dodge enemy fire & traverse the levels.

There's quite a variety in the weapons you find and the different weapons actually play differently rather than simply being 'the fire/ice/lightning shotgun/SMG/pistol', something a lot of other games with elemental weapons seem to suffer from. The 6 classes offer 12 different abilities to make use of, and the upgrades you attain each run allow for even further specialization. For example, the engineer has drones & an explosive blaster. You can upgrade the drones to summon more at once, equip them with different sidearms, apply different elemental debuffs, or you could upgrade your blaster into a shotgun or long-range sniping tool, or mix both by making your drones focus on the target you last hit with the blaster for increased damage. While I'm not a fan of every class, in general the variety of upgrades feels great and not once did I get the impression a specific upgrade is required or far better than the others.

While it's probably technically possible to beat the game on your first attempt, there are some fairly artificial blockers in place. Some of the later bosses have mechanics during their fight that act as a strict timer; if you can't kill the boss in time, you die no matter what. They basically act as DPS checks, and without the proper upgrades to your run it's pretty nearly impossible to pass them. Doesn't feel great to lose a run to a DPS check, but unless you're a whiz at the game (or playing on a lower difficulty where it likely doesn't matter) you probably won't hit this kind of wall before you've upgraded enough to pass it.

Overall a great purchase, on or off sale, and better with a friend. Would be nice if more than 2-player co-op was possible but I understand why it isn't from the context of gameplay balance.",1705026688,1705116190,True,0,0,0.477941185235977173,0,True,False,False

It's holdin' on, though the road's long
And seein' light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowin' who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin' (yeah, yeah)
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
Who can relate? Woo
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I finally wanna be alive (finally wanna be alive)
I finally wanna be alive (hey)
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive (finally wanna be alive)
I finally wanna be alive (oh)
I don't wanna die (no, I don't wanna die)
I don't wanna die
(I just wanna live)
(I just wanna live)
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore",1705096608,1705096608,True,1,0,0.466860473155975342,0,True,False,False

Pretty much everything you see on the tin with this game is exactly what it is, but the quality of the game itself is apparent in just about every corner of the design. The controls and gameplay are super smooth and fluid, allowing for skillful plays and growth of ability. The art design is colorful and feels unique. Music is BOPPIN! And the gun game enthusiast in me loves the variety of the arsenal you can use. It's already fun in single player, but with a co-op buddy it cranks up the fun even more.

At current time I only have a few hours in this, but I already know I'm going to put several dozen more into this game. Highly recommend and looking forward to future content.

The main issue for me is the mini-boss directly before a safe zone that has zero healer without a key.

Gunfire reborn is in a similar vein to this one, however, Roboquest blow its away in pretty much every area I can think of and most importantly the ""hook"" of just wanting to keep playing, enemies are interesting, skilled and intelligent, weapons, items, classes, perks all are deep and rewarding and game play is buttery smooth and fast. 

The graphics are excellent and the game runs very vast and smooth. In almost three hours I haven't encountered a single bug, glitch or hiccup.  This game is amazing polished for Early Access, and seemingly so far their is a wealth of content. 

I highly recommend this one if you enjoy FPS's and Roguelites, best combination of the two Genre's I have found thus far. I really hope the DEV does well enough to keep expanding and working on this one, it is a True Gem IMHO. 

Update a year Later: 

This has been my go to game for the last couple months...it has that certain I can always play and do something different and advance a little each time feel...I really hope they keep on and expand this one.",1645273409,1705023357,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

The devs have tried to keep a open line of communication and can deliver a super enjoyable fast paced experience though suffers from unbalance between characters and weapons within runs. There's many secrets and things to unlock in interesting ways and some more repetitive but all gives a large arsenal or kit to use.

The start of the game is hard but once you get a feel for whats up, you swiftly start to move through levels faster and faster while starting to understand the basic enemies. The game maintains the learning through gameplay till about stage 3 or 4 where you really start to meet elemental or ""elite"" enemies. This is where it probably gets the most frustrating for most who play as the status effects range from weakening you, slowing you and to the worst: being hacked where you have to tap a key three times to get out. A great idea but in execution, leaves you to take forced damage on top of the already large amount of things that can be on screen at once. And a LOT of stuff can be on screen at once especially in the final boss fight which is like every infuriating attack at once.

A lot of the end game kind of feels like how stun is; forced damage to stop the crazy fast robot. All of which can be avoided through one single class, making the others feeling super squishy which is a shame given how diverse the classes can be.

I think after some balancing and maybe more community feedback, it could reach it's best but for now, its pretty good. 7.5-8/10 Worth picking up if fps and roguelikes are your thing",1699569952,1704992841,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The closest thing I could compare this game to is Borderlands 2 with massive inspiration from the most recent DOOM, without the hours you'd need to level a character, make a build, and complete 2 playthroughs just to get to Ultimate VH mode. This game really pushes you to be in the forefront of the slaughter rather than far away, as health drops disappear quite quickly on Standard+.

The enemy priority system is glorious. You'll quickly realize that many enemies can't land a bead on you as long as you keep moving, but other enemies mess up your ability to move in ways that aren't inherently frustrating. Enemies with laser attacks that aim ahead of you, snipers that can near-guaranteed land a shot on you if they finish their charge, and enemies that litter the ground with explosives that prove dangerous to land or walk into (but you can shoot them to make them disappear immediately).

This game very much reminds me of Gunfire Reborn, but way faster. A lot of weapons and parts of the game reminds me of it. Though I prefer the movement, secrets, and gun play way better in Roboquest but in Gunfire I prefer the build variety and characters, I'd say.

After finishing the achievements I wanted to make a quick edit. I still love this game but I definitely feel the weakest part is the playable characters, especially if I'm comparing it to Gunfire Reborn. I feel in this game it's way more about the weapons and gunfire is the opposite. I get excited in Gunfire figuring out who I'm gonna play and what build I'm gonna try going for.

FPS elements include satisfying movement (featuring rail sliding, double jumping, head stomping) and interesting level design with rewarding secrets to discover. Each playable character has unique abilities that shape the way the game is played. Some of these abilities include a toggle-able invulnerability shield that recharges over time, a stealth ability, or drones that assist you and inherit some of your traits. Your robot character receives a new trait with every level-up and can dramatically alter your play style. As fun as the FPS game-play already is, it is enhanced by the roguelite features.

Loot includes weapons with randomized traits with varying levels of rarity. Guns (or crossbows, throwing knives, flamethrowers, chainsaws, etc.) may include additional abilities or attributes (for example a rocket launcher can come equipped with an under-barrel shotgun or hit scan projectiles that immediately reach their target).

The only area where this game is lacking is the story. It's not very captivating and does not include any animations or voice over. The music can be a bit lacking in some areas as well.

Roboquest is an absolute masterclass in rogue-like and shooter mechanics, animations, and game-play loop. I played it off and on through early access right into launch of 1.0 and the devs have always been extremely responsive and positive towards feedback they have received, implementing tons of things that otherwise might not have even made it into the game. 
It really is a charming game. Early on in my roboquesting i was hearkened back to the days of borderlands 1 and 2, with the cell shaded graphics and weird wacky guns. I really like the POW! chat box the guns have. But this is far ahead of that.

If someone had told me that this was an indie studio and i didn't know any better, i might not have even believed them. Everything is such top notch quality it's hard to go wrong with this one.

If you have a friend, or even if you just like rogue-likes, this is certainly a game you should play. Oh yeah, did i mention the soundtrack? Damn, that soundtrack! Just play and you will see what i mean.

But I have bad health so I can't play the game more than one hour. So mostly I ended a game under 30m if possible.

This game doesn't have a save option. It means that if you enter the stage, and cleared, and want some take a rest to exit the game, all your progress is gone. Forever.

This is just lazy fck and madness. The game doesn't even let you know when you try to exit the game, just telling you that ""Do you want to exit the game?"" bllsht. There's no mention of ""you will lose every progress and go back to the hub level if you exit now.""

What a fantastic, huge waste of my time. The lazy dev said it's HARD TO IMPLEMENT SUCH A SMALL TEAM, so they will not put it in.

Okay, then, what if the game crashed? What if your computer suddenly powers off?

Now you know the truth. Fk this game. I'll refund it.

p.s. Average time to clear one level takes 30-40m. Clear the entire game takes 5-15h. There's no way to take a break time and no way to exit. Exit? You'll lose everything. No crash recovery. Nothing. Just Nothing. Don't buy it until they take this seriously and implement it. Oh yeah, and the each major update devs will wipe out your total progress. It's true.

p.p.s. So here's the edit: the overall game balance is broken, input system is just a mess. this game have a great potential but currently still you smelling sh1t.

Don't buy this stuff, it's horrible abomination. Stay away this shit and try GOOD GAMES. It's sh1t ball.

p.p.p.s. The game balance is totally broken. Again don't buy this SH1T.

p.p.p.p.s. Unbalanced piece of garbage, trash. Fuck you devs.

p.p.p.p.p.s. Lots of negative reviewed people talking about the multiplayer but this game itself is a pure vomit. The game is very poorly designed, the overall balance is total garbage, the harder difficulty level just enemies tough and do more damage(typical bulletsponge bullsh1t) and overall game play is very very broken. The only good thing is that the graphic and the weapon mechanics and animations, otherwise all steaming pile of goatsh1t. The final bossfight is really disgusting, the 2nd phase is just f**king annoying and nothing. If you get lucky you don't get any hit and beat it. But if you are bad f**king luck the boss always do disgusting, abominating unavoidable large area scale attacks continuously. F**k you game and F**k you developers to making this horsesh1t.

It is basically a fun FPS with great movement mechanics and depth. There are multiple movement speeds and mechanics that reward skill like bunny-hopping with slide+jump, secret gadgets and rails. Rogue-like perks and weapon traits are great and build variety is really good. You can make all sorts of AOE or single-target crit builds, or focus on surviveability. There are a lot of secrets and multiple paths to take to reach multiple sections of the map which add to replayability and fun-factor. 


Pros:
-Good core shooting mechanics
-A lot of fun hitscan, projectile and melee weapons 
-Amazing movement 
-Cool enemy design 
-Great music
-Good progression system, secrets and unlockables
-Fun classes
-Quirky and cool world 
-Good level design 
-Multiple difficulties 
-Runs really well 
-High replayability and multiplayer 

Cons: 
-Some annoying enemies and minor collision bugs

I played this on the max difficulty (Hard) to ensure I got as much time as I could out of this game before beating it, since I quickly knew I would want to 100% it. It is rogue-like progression where you are meant to fail and upgrade after each run before trying again. There are different paths to take with different collectibles and secrets for further upgrades. The story is somewhat simple (so if you are looking for an involved story, sorry this won't fulfill that), but it was still fun to piece together tidbits from the data-logs about a timeline regarding humanity's future. The soundtrack slaps and has a different song for each path of certain levels you are on. The bosses and puzzles were challenging enough to feel rewarding, but not too challenging to where it caused frustration. The many different types of weapon play styles and class play styles to choose from was refreshing, because I could try different approaches to every run (or just for fun). The stylistic choice regarding the art with cell-shading gave it a lot of character, and it suited the robot designs and environment art very well (although the character Max looked a little wonky in-game). I loved that the cinematic portions were in the style of animated comics as well. I enjoyed that the base camp upgraded along the way - while also letting me keep track of my achievements and stuff that I found.

I do kind of wish some of the bosses had harder modes, maybe with extra affixes or ng+ type run modes, to create a longer endgame and sense of chaos for different runs. That way I would have a reason to continue playing after 100%ing it, but perhaps they may do that in a sequel? One can hope. There were a couple of moments where it felt repetitive, but that comes with the territory of most rogue-likes.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this game, especially if you are a fan of rogue-likes and just want a good old gauntlet-type game that doesn't take itself TOO seriously (but seriously enough to still be fun and have variety). I'm getting close to 100%ing it on the Hard difficulty, and once I do it'll probably be around 40 through 50 hours of game time - which I think is worth the cost. If you are a fan of Hades but want something simpler and more chill just to relax with yourself (or a friend since you can play as a group of 2 total), this could be a decent fit.

P.S. This kind of felt like a BETTER version of what Overwatch PvE was originally promised as, but as a rogue-like.

*** (EDIT: Turns out there is a NG+ mode actually, that you unlock after beating it <(UwU)> (although it seems to just be a ramp up in difficulty rather than additional affixes so far). ***",1704270878,1704610006,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

imagine playing doom, and then a QTE pops up that you have to do WITH MOVEMENT KEYS so you literally cant move while its happening and take damage even if you nail it perfectly. lazy! :)

Roboquest is a fast-paced FPS Roguelike developed by RyseUp Studios and published by Starbreeze Publishing.

Graphics: 9/10

Lovely cell-shaded Borderlands-like graphics with a lovely variety of landscapes. Such well done visuals and designs., I love it.

Gameplay: 9/10

I expected this to be another boring clone of Gunfire Reborn, but much to my surprise, it feels, dare I say better than Gunfire Reborn. It's a fast-paced looter shooter roguelike where every movement feels so smooth, mechanics are lovely, and the gadgets make the game feel even better than before. With a vast array of weapons, healthy selection of upgrades, gadgets and an addicting game loop, this kept me on for longer than I initially thought. One of the reasons this isn't a 10 out of 10 is cause it doesn't have as much content as Gunfire, but it definitely feels MUCH better. It lacks other modes, but you can play by yourself or with friends A.K.A Brobots. Another point taker is that it doesn't have support for up to 4 players online, which sucks cause I feel like having 4 players is essential to a fun, replayable Roguelike experience if you're bringing multiple people on board. But I understand.

Story: ?/10 doesn't really speak to me, but it won't affect the game's rating.

Music: 8/10

Love the dubstep-like soundtrack, each theme fits with the tone of each level. Fitting for a bot, but most importantly, fitting for the game. :heart:

Overall: 8/10

A fast-paced roguelike perfect for one of my many roguelike cravings. It feels godlike, it looks amazing, the replay loop keeps making me come back for more, but the lack of modes or 4 player support is definitely a letdown. I can get why it isn't present, as this game is very clearly designed for 2 players at a time, so it's fair they wouldn't be able to include 4 player.

The game is horrendously optimized and has a history of crashing on high end pcs (including my own). The devs in the discord are completely unhelpful and would rather keep pushing useless content than actually fixing any of the problems that have been arising from their player base. The bug reporting channels are often overlooked by devs and major software bugs are brushed past. On top of this, there is a major issue when it comes to the online feature. A mass of people which, once again, includes myself, cannot use the online features at all,  since your account needs to be connected to Epic Games. ""Just connect to Epic"" you'll most likely think, but this could not be further from naive. Connecting to epic does nothing and you're doomed to sit staring at a wheel that promises a connection. To reiterate my before point, I have been asking for a solution from the devs for two weeks straight, every, single, day, in the discord. The only response I'm able to get is childish, similarly to the way a child would say, ""oopsies, I will for sure look into that"", then discard the issue. I'm not the only one facing these problems, the discord is riddled with people on all different platforms with bugs that honestly should have been resolved in play testing before release. Once again, hardly any interaction from the devs.

As for the small amount of game play, the only fun part of the game is flying around rocket jumping; combat is too easy, even on the New Game ++++ game mode. The secrets are nothing but obvious and the map is anything but procedural, so get used to playing the same path down to the pixel every run. Achievement hunting bears no satisfaction due to there being only about 5 reasonably difficult tasks to seek. Upgrading your base camp has no additional effects other than looks. The first few runs of the game are blissful, but then all you need is the same few weapons to instantly win the game. The raw stats feel practically useless because the only ""items"" to boost you are the special little cards that %90 of the time, are based for weapon use. 

To summarize: 
The game is unplayable from bugs, boring game play loop, ignorant devs, online doesn't work, and my computer is now a nuclear reactor. Waste of $25

in my opinion, for a roguelite/roguelike to be successful, it MUST have the following:

-Excellent core gameplay. 
-Interesting weapon and modifier variety.
-Secrets and alternate paths.

If these fundamentals are accomplished, then the resulting experience is fun and engaging with enough unknowns and unlockables to keep the player coming back and wanting more. Roboquest, in my opinion, meets all of these characteristics in spades. AND MORE. 

Gameplay:
The movement in this game is absolutely godly. It is incredibly responsive and high-speed. Weapons are snappy and responsive and enemy encounters are loosely ""room-by-room"" and must be handled differently based on the enemy types. Killing an enemy drops some healing orbs, so you are given incentive to stay close to the action, which is incredibly fun and rewarding. Maps have a respectable amount of verticality (which is mostly optional, but it is there), and with the variety of long range weapons provided, I believe those gravitating towards sniping and long range fights would find their playstyle reasonably supported here. If you enjoy FPS games that challenge your awareness and reward your aim, Roboquest will definitely satisfy you in this regard. 

Build variety:
I have only ever played on Hard mode and above. Over my time with the game, I have been surprised by how many different guns I have found success with, compared to always wanting the same gun every time because it is overpowered. Shotguns, rifles, knives, mortars - the game has a ton of different weapons, and they all (in my experience) can be relevant if approached the right way, and if the player enjoys them. Each class has its own unique abilities and perks for these abilities, so there is variety here as well. These are standard roguelite qualities, and Roboquest meets them all satisfactorily. There are a LOT OF GUNS. 

I haven't spent a lot of time on the different classes yet, but so far for me, Commando feels the best. I can't speak to the class variety and balance, but if others found issues here, then based on my other impressions of this game so far, I would trust the devs to balance them over time. 

Gameplay Loop:
The path to the final boss has many twists and turns. From the starting area (which is the same for every run, as far as I know), the player soon reaches an intersection where they can choose from 3 different paths. Each path leads to a different environment, which each have their own forks and alternate paths. With my 21 hours in the game, I still haven't found every available path/location. Based on your current goals, you will be choosing one route over another; there is no ""best"" route, and this contributes to the variety and player choice fulfillment of the core game. 

Balance/Difficulty:
This game is very fair; to me, the difficulty and game mechanics give a lot of respect to the player. When I die, it isn't because of an unfair mechanic or something I couldn't see coming. The encounters in this game escalate with several status effects, lasers, enemy behaviors, and hazards that keep the player on their toes. It is no cake walk, and it reaches a peak that I can only describe as ""adderall crackhead insanity"" and I love it. As difficulty has increased, I have not found ""more difficulty"" equaling health-sponge enemies or enemies randomly one-shotting me, as it does in other games. The game has tons of enemy types and behaviors that it cranks up proportionately, resulting in increased difficulty that in no way compromises the awesome core experience. The game is cute and cartoon-y, but the developers know what they're doing. This game can be brutally hard if you want it to be, and that difficulty is fun as heck. Difficulty and balance are further elaborated on in the Aesthetics section of this review where I talk about enemy appearances.

Secrets/Long-Term Progression:
Aside from the smaller upgrades the player can make between runs, there are also upgrades that provide a new core capability to the player. I have not unlocked all of these yet, but so far, these further complement the gameplay and evolve it without making it too easy or breaking it. The methods in which one unlocks new paths and new run modifiers are varied and obscure. For example, there are gates that require a code to open them, and I still haven't figured out how to unlock them (I haven't looked these things up as I enjoy figuring them out). For one of them, I had to bring a guy some swim trunks. These puzzles and secrets respect the player's intelligence and provide incentive to look around their environment and think creatively. They aren't spoonfed to the player by the developers and found with minimal effort.

When I beat the final boss for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not the end (but it did end the run). I still have much more to unlock and discover. This moment solidified Roboquest as a great game to me, since leading up to the final boss, I was concerned if I'd want to keep playing once I had beaten it. I still definitely do. 

Aesthetics/OST:
It is criminal that this game's OST is confined to a section that is often overlooked. It is incredible. I don't listen to EDM often, and this soundtrack SLAPS. Each environment, and there are many, has its own soundtrack (I'm pretty sure). Some locations have house music, some have drum n bass, some are raw dirty electro. These tracks are specific to their maps, so on top of each environment having its own unique identity, it also has its own musical vibe. It's DOPE.

I've seen some criticize the appearance of enemies in this game, as they are all robots. There aren't different enemy factions or anything - it's just robots. I personally do not mind this, and find it almost necessary for the core experience the devs have created here. 

When I see any enemy at a glance, I know exactly what it is and what it does, and this is CRUCIAL. Again, this game is very fair and you do not die to BS. When I reach the next group of enemies, I can immediately begin making decisions on what enemies I want to kill first, and which ones to watch out for. Does an enemy shield other enemies? Does it stun me? Snare me? Cloak and assassinate me? Spawn bombs or other smaller enemies? Mess with my vision? A game like this can easily become an onslaught of random damage lasers, balls, debuffs, and bullets, with no rhyme or reason, but Roboquest does not. I can clearly assess a room which enables me to run into groups of enemies without getting obliterated. This is all because the game provides information and has designed its enemies to make this possible. A case could be made that there could still be more enemy appearance variety, but I'm not invested in that debate. For what it is, the enemy appearances facilitate and deepen this awesome experience crafted by the developers. One enemy type is a stationary tower that shields all nearby enemies. Any shield on an enemy has a little spike on it which clearly points in the direction of the tower so you can find it and destroy it. Little details like this, to me, show the care and savviness of the developers. 

Story:
I haven't paid much attention to the story. Like most games of this genre, story isn't a requirement. But what I have picked up is still cute and enjoyable. For a roguelite, I'd say it's more than serviceable, which is all it needs to be. 

Overall:
Is Roboquest the new sliced bread or the best roguelite ever made? I don't know, but it is an EXCELLENT game. It checks all my boxes and then some, and has tons of personality that sets it apart both visually and gameplay-wise. I can only assume that the devs know what they're doing, because every element of this game is crafted with a lot of care and dialed in. For $25, it's a phenomenal deal.

What's good:
- [b]aggression is rewarded.[/b]  Health pickups on melee kills, on-hit healing from bosses
- [b]movement is fast[/b]. Achieved through near constant different speed buffs in a battle + head-stomping + rocket jumping and lots more. Don't let the enclosed environment fool you, there is plenty of space to zoom around. 
- [b]the soundtrack[/b] that sets the stage: hasty and energetic electro+metal-ish with pauses in between stages to take a breather
-[b]build variety[/b]: want melee smacking? They got it covered. Want to make a shoot for 9k damage? Sure thing. Wanna be a caster? Why not, here are upgrades to make your abilities recover faster. Do you like to cover things with lead? Check out infinite ammo upgrade and make it rain. Like bombing things? Make it bigger and hit harder!
- some thought was put into [b]boss fights[/b] (various environments, attacks and more)

Some features: 
- 10+ weapons to choose from with different mechanics + 3 different elemental weapons. I was glad to see that it is possible to kill fire with fire. Only the elemental effect is removed 
- 6 different classes of different play-style

The only bad thing is the ""goofy ahh"" plot of the game which leans to actual toddlers. Though the time is not spent in endless dialogues.

It's like a combination of Overwatch and Borderlands with a bit of base building using resources you collected during your runs. Roboquest has that 'just one more run' feeling towards it and it's hard to put  down.

Pros:

+ Gunplay feels really good and there's a wide selection of guns from everything to machine guns, 3 round burst rifles, grenade launchers, to weirder more experimental weapons

+ The soundtrack is amazing. While games like Doom Eternal used its blaring metal soundtrack to keep the pace going and get you into the rhythm of the fast paced gunplay Roboquest does this with its bumping electronic and rock soundtrack.

+ Each class feels viable and has a different playstyle. If you want to play a tanky class with a shield you can do that. If you want to play a fast paced ninja class using invisibility and critical hits there's a class for that. If you want to be an engineer who builds turrets and spams grenades there's a class for that. It keeps variety fresh between runs.

+ You can make some stupidly broken but fun builds if you get the right guns and perks during a run. During one of my guns I got a SMG with a large magazine and a high fire rate that also fired a shotgun blast every 5 bullets. During that same run I also got a perk that gave me unlimited ammo and increased my fire rate when I popped my shield which allowed me to melt anything in front of me including bosses when it was active.

Cons:

- Movement feels fine but there's a lack of momentum and verticality while in the air and sliding. This makes pulling off some tricks like moving around arenas and grinding on rails not feel as smoothly as they should.

- Combat favors CQC and highly aggressive burst damage builds due to how chip damage and health pickups work. When you kill an enemy they drop health orbs that can be picked up for a short time until they disappear. This means if you're sitting back with a sniper or long ranged weapon you're going to be missing out on a lot of health pickups during a run.

- Near some of the ending levels enemies get quite annoyingly bullet spongey and tiny making them hard to hit

- Minor complaint, but there's no way to save your current run if you need to step away for whatever reason. It would be nice to be able to close the game and continue the run without having to restart especially in a genre that's designed for pick up and play short bursts of gameplay.

I hate the idea of having to backtrack for keys for doors, backtrack to get enemies, backtrack to get items, and just having to play the same levels and enemies mindlessly for hours while hoping to get a good enough combo to try to progress. This is absolutely not the game for someone who doesn't want have to restart 900 times. I would be less angry about it if it wasn't for the fact that the devs idea of making things more difficult for the player is just completely cutting off any chance of healing and completely filling a room with enemies who shoot bouncing orbs that are larger than the enemy and last for quite awhile.

Try it. 6 hours in engaging with the meta progression system through many runs, I'm still loving the bullet hell. There's so many little things that make me want to root for this game. The tutorial gauges your skill and recommends a good difficulty, something I didn't even realize until discussion with a friend. There's grind rails. I haven't had a good grind rail since Rachet & Clank. The guns all feel right to fire with kick and impact and crisp sounds, with variety for my dumbass rushing into every room with shotguns and my buddy preferring sniping and long range. Enemy variety is also encouraging the use of different weapons, high level play needing to switch between the two guns you can hold while they ""pocket reload"". Aggressive auto aim on controller helps me have a good time despite hand problems preventing Mouse and Keyboard use. It's a fast fun game that nails it.
The meta progression had me worried about repetition. This is a roguelite and that means repeating level 1 a lot. Even on Hard, the first two levels are just warmup baby tier difficulty and it makes speedrunning them fast, but indeed stale. The music bops per level stay fresh surprisingly despite that. The soundtrack is fantastic. The small but perfect way it triggers when opening up a level gets me every time. It even shuts up if you loiter in the beginning area as to not repeat the beginning over and over. There's tons of little things like that I appreciate. I'm just now discovering some of the secrets and end game challenges and look forward to completing everything in it.
Something from Gunfire Reborn I was also worried about is getting overpowered and ruining the balance. Don't know how far Meta progression will trivialize the game, but so far learning the actual game and how to dodge its enemies' fire has been what's most important along with how to build a character to synergize with whatever weapon or skills are active. This game is balanced and you can get far on skill alone, but the average player is definitely not getting to the end prematurely on Hard. There's a mechanic to add more elite enemies to the map which is toggle-able, so I look forward to making it as hard as possible to match whatever unlocks players receive.

I feel like a mix of Borderlands and Gunfire Reborn to me. You don't have to walk a ton between each stages, you're just straight in the action as soon as you go through a door. It does become very bullet hell-like, but the game has a ton of ways to deal with that (abilities, certain guns, characters, you can use different routes, etc.)

The only negative I'd have is that you're rewarded for finishing a level as quick as possible, but you don't have to go at sonic speed either so it's not too bad. Health regeneration can be a problem sometimes on hard difficulty, but it's not that bad once you've unlocked a few things.

Overall every part of the core game-play is incredible. The guns are expertly designed, game looks amazing, the abilities pair well together and feel great on their own, the movement feels amazing, the enemies and bosses are properly challenging, and the list goes on. Roboquest is not without its problem though. First, the crouch mechanic feels out of place because the game incentives you not to use it. Roboquest rewards you for playing quickly and aggressively with a time bonus, so slowing down to patiently snipe enemies while crouched behind cover digs into your time bonus. Second, there are dedicated skills that give you better stats for crouching. These skills reward you for playing worse as you either have to crouch in the open which breaks your flow or you have to play more slowly which cuts into your time reward. Third, the exploration feels out of place. The game heavily rewards you for exploring every nook and cranny, but exploring can take quite a bit of time and is done best with one class which has a teleport ability that makes it easier to reach high places. The time bonus punishing you for taking any detours and the game rewarding you for taking detours ultimately feels like the game is contradicting what it's tell you as a player to do. This is eased by the easier game modes, the easiest of them making it very enjoyable to explore. Despite that, I wish the game focused more on exploration in the early game and included the time bonus as an end game or post game feature. None of these flaws make the core game-play experience worse, but they do make it feel less polished than it could be.
TLDR: Highly recommend to rouge lite fans, minor flaws take the game from a 9/10 to a 7.5/10.",1703477385,1704177772,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With the aesthetics and weapons generation system of Borderlands, the pace and combat style of Doom 2016, and the item progression system of Risk of Rain, Risk Of Borderdoom is an extremely fun, very replayeable shoot'-em-up. 

Though the story doesn't do anything new, it doesn't need to - it's only there to provide some obligatory context for why you're rampaging through an endless horde of seething killer robots. The game's movement system is fluid, smooth, and responsive; the guns are extremely meaty and satisfying; the gunplay is demanding but rewarding, and there's a decent variety of classes. A wide variety of guns, an acceptable number of levels, and an array of unlockable content and side-paths give you plenty of reasons to keep coming back to the already-rock-solid gameplay loop. For the price tag, you really can't go wrong here.

here's some of the pros:

- you don't outright get power with upgrades. You mostly get quality of life, nicer weapons and some new classes that are all balanced pretty much at the same level. You get farther in the game primarily by getting better at it. 
- Collectibles are incredibly well handled. They are well hidden and are always satisfying to find. After you get to about the halfway mark, you get an item that can greatly help you find them. Each collectible Gives you more upgrade materials. 
- Gadgets are fun! You can get a jetpack! 
- Good, original weapons. In one run I had a shotgun, whose projectiles both pierced enemies and bounced off walls. Every shot sent 20 pellets flying around the room. I was doing more damage with collateral than my actual aimed shots. You can rocket jump with a lot of explosive weapons! The modifiers greatly impact how weapons play. For example I had a rocket launcher that had the hit scan modifier (meaning that instead of throwing a projectile it just instantly hits wherever you aim.) that modifier removed range restrictions. I was playing a sniper with explosive ammo. Felt insane. 
- Has 2 player support! It feels so much better with a buddy who you can talk with, have some fun with and who can revive you when you're down. It's well balanced around multiplayer as well, as long you progress alongside each other. 

Do not use a guide, it's better experienced if you explore yourself. 

The only cons so far: 
- some of the bosses are a bit annoying. One of them was timed, which became a dps check. we barely managed to do enough and it felt like the worst fight. 
- The shovel needs to be used by both. Most other collectibles work just fine for both players, but the shovel needs to be handed around, so you need to find a weapon that's lying around and swap it through. Tiny bit annoying.

and my review is closer to a 6/10, maybe higher if you put parts of the game in a vacuum

this game suffers from a fairly suffocating game-play loop, what i mean by that is on paper it sounds like a lot of fun and it is for a few runs, but after a while, you can sum up a majority of runs to ""oh OK. guess that's it then."" you don't feel like your improving at a noticeable rate, your unlocking things and that helps you progress easier, and in general i've never been so baffled to see my skill feel capped, and this is entirely pushing ""skill issue"" aside, obviously playing better rewards you, however with how somewhat limited your survival options are in this game (normally not an issue but it is noticeable in a game like this) you end up wanting more mobility options or ways to restore your scratch hp (a secondary hp bar over your main hp bar that ISNT hp, but is easily able to become your main hp, I explain it poorly here though, try the demo) now that's not to say i want the game to be easier, I fully understand why I lose a lot of runs to a random projectile (namely i don't move well enough to naturally dodge everything, meaning when i don't see something fly at me i end up getting hit)
but that's exactly why the game feels like a chore, i die in the same place every game, everything before it is S rank andd then I reach that one part i struggle with and die less than a quarter way... again. ""oh OK. guess that's it then."" even a form of ""training"" mode (or a wave survival) would do wonders for the natural process of this game, maybe select an arena like oasis or ruins and just play with a changing environment and generated enemies, that way you can get into a groove and understand the enemies better, besides that? I want more control over the rng of the game OTHER than more rerolls and more options, give me the ability to at least partially hand pick traits on a weapon, or at least let me pick a weapon of my choosing to use more often like the kunai.",1704046348,1704046348,False,2,0,0.427762389183044434,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is robust, yet fluid, the movement is a mix of quake and titanfall, the artystyle is exteramly polished. Gameplay loop is fun, and takes time to master, no 2 runs are the same. Class diversity is prominent and well done, each robot feels unique in its playstyle and there is enough variety for a good amount of replayability. Enemy designs are unique and become second nature when you're in game, making it easy to diagnose what ones require your immediate attention during your run.

The movement is nice. There's a big focus on your kit using your movement to assist in generating high damage, AND to bounce around and avoid enemy projectiles.

The guns control like a dream. There are some stinkers (looking at most of the laser projectile based ones), but they are all usable.

The bosses are challenging, but mostly fair. There are some that are uber punishing to new players, like a boss that will give you an instant game-over if you don't pull a lever on the boss's back.

The upgrade system is really nice, but if you played the beta, you probably already have a maxed out basecamp.

If you want a fast-paced, movement-driven, roguelite shooter, give it a try (There's a demo. For Free. An ancient concept rarely seen nowadays, but the one getting me to play the Early Access and now the full game. Download it now.)

It might not have thousands of areas to play through, but learing the best methods to clear the types of rooms and corridors you encounter in each area is a lot of fun. Almost all weapons are usable without a problem and well balanced. All available Classes can wield all weapon types to great effect and give their own spin on gameplay.

Invisibility paired with decoys that make enemies vulnerable and kill them with no further input of yours? Let the world explode... multiple times thanks to instant resets of abilites? Ignore all guns and pick up a good ol' rusty shovel that still manages to fire rockets and ricochet into several targets? Gotcha. 

I love this game. Played it a lot in EA and at least play a round daily since full release. 

I cannot recommend it tho if your alloted gaming time is less than an hour, as there is no way to save your game mid run. If it's just some stuff at home that keeps ya occupied and you can leave it running in the background, then all's good. If ya gotta dip and shut down your PC tho... keep away.",1703890465,1703890465,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The shooting is snappy, the movement, though not as extreme as something like Ultrakill's, feels fluent, dodging is encouraged since the enemies only shoot projectiles and the game just feels incredibly good to play. It's kind of like Overwatch/Borderlands with roguelite gameplay loop and better movement. There's a bunch of weapons and you can pretty much experiment and build around your own playstyle freely, which I really like. The RNG when it comes to weapons and items is fairly consistent. The different classes feel similar, but are different enough to justify their existence. I havan't given the multiplayer a try yet because none of my friends have the game, but I'm definitely going to recommend it to them as it seems it would be fun co-op, though it's only up to 2 players.

content wise, there are many things (not too many) to unlock, all in the form of secrets, varied quests, challenges, different routes... once unlocked, they give you permanent upgrades that really change the way you play the game (notably the movement)
once that's done, you can go up in difficulty and try to get a S-rank run/unlock all steam achievements, so replayability++

graphisms look good, cartoon style (so not too performance greedy, that's good as well)

as for the gameplay, 4 things :
- movement : feels good and if used well, can give you a **real** advantage ;; you can upgrade it
(it's my favourite thing about this game, but it can also get very frustrating when you upgrade your speed and get stuck in edges)
- learning foes' patterns/maps (obviously)
- character upgrading : it's really possible to adapt your character to your playstyle, or the other way around ;; runs can be very different, though a few dozen hours are enough to explore all the possibilities
- weapons : they are varied and fit different playstyles, so again, you can adapt your bot to something that suits you but you'll see them all in a few dozen hours

Roboquest is clearly an inspired game but still feels so unique compared to what it pulls from. Immediately you'll feel the vibe of Borderlands, Risk of Rain, Deep Rock Galactic, and other gamer games because I definitely play video games.

Easy to understand perk building. I love how when leveling up and selecting a new perk, if you highlight over one that you're considering, the game highlights what that perk will affect with your existing choices. The secrets in this game are just so much fun. The way you uncover new areas, enemies, items, and bosses, is just so creative.

Music is absolutely bumping and keeps you in the game really well.  Meta-progression so far seems good, unlocking new classes, permanent upgrades and equipment.

One problem though is that like many roguelikes, Roboquest does not have any way to save a run in progress, at least not that I've found.  This can actually be a problem for this game because getting past chapter 3 (of 4 or maybe more chapters, I've not beaten the game yet) took well over an hour, so full runs are pretty long by roguelike standards, and without any way to save and come back you have to do it all in one sitting.  A simple checkpoint or save system on the safezones in the levels or beginning of a level would definitely go a long way.

Your build up until it can be steam rolling through groups of enemies then suddenly you hit Iris and you're doing nothing because you didn't spec for single target damage. In theory you could argue this means you have to build around dealing with both but in reality, Iris is the only ever stumbling block for me which tends to lead me down the same routes and away from explosives which are pretty much always going to be weak vs Iris.

What I think is a shame is that during the run, the goliaths present a generally excellent middleground where you're in arenas that test both single and multi target damage while Iris is just a giant DPS wall check. Clearly it'd requite a lot of fundamental changing to the fight to make it more balanced but I would really love to see this addressed because it's quite infuriating that both the other games I mentioned feel like they share this problem.

I also think the movement options in the game with all the gadgets unlocked is a bit over the top. Yes you can disable them of course, but are you going to? Probably not. You're probably going to opt to fly around endlessly without touching the floor which is fun but at some point feels like you're not all that mentally engaged with the environment.

Finally, I think the game would do with some more build variety. There's a lot of weapons and items but too often they're just ""do more damage"" in however roundabout way. More purple items with significant up and downsides to encourage genuinely different play styles would go a long way to mix things up. Even though I think it's an issue I would still say the game walks the fine line between making the player change their ideas on the fly and enabling you to go in with a plan. With a roguelike I think it's important that you can have a plan but you're still forced to adapt with what items you get. If you're just going to make all the decisions in the spawn room and then wait for the items to inevitably pop up the player is likely to just do the same thing constantly. It's really hard to get this right and I'd say Roboquest is at least 80% of the way there, maybe leaning too far into being too easy to pick the same things every time as you unlock more shops (ESPECIALLY once you get semi-free rerolls)

Really those are my only notable issues with the game despite it filling out a few paragraphs. It feels amazing to play, the graphics are fantastically readable and clear, soundtrack is excellent. Definitely worth the asking price.",1703629854,1703629854,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is one of the smoothest and most satisfying FPS games I've played, and personally I recommend this over Gunfire Reborn (which I found too slow.)

Roboquest focuses hard on the fundamentals: Snappy aim, fluent movement and level traversal (running safely around many enemies in a small room) and player skill above all else. In theory you could have an entire run where you avoid all damage, due to enemies shooting with telegraphed attacks and projectiles that can all be dodged.

The game is also filled with secrets that can unlock various new things, A LOT of which are really well hidden, but can give you crazy stuff like new starting weapons, new potential routes, and new mechanics such as new movement options that... Honestly, can break the entire game at times and let you ignore entire challenge rooms once you find them.

My only main gripe is that some of those secrets are incredibly hard to find and hide things that honestly just make the game better, but you won't know how to get them quickly unless you google it, and that Max looks like a short 25 year old woman due to her crows-feet eyes.

The mechanics flow so good in this game that if you know what you're doing and the limits of your character/build, you'll feel like an unstoppable beast. Once you start to unlock some of the core mechanics of the game (mostly in the form of basecamp upgrades and gadgets), the game starts to quickly become more exciting. This plus the satisfyingly pseudo-random nature of the game is good enough for me to bust out tons of hours into this. I've completed the game and unlocked most things, but I can see myself coming back to this just to warm up my aim. 

My only criticism to this game is that it's too easy to take away a lot of the ""random"" elements (and the game is a bit easy itself once you unlock everything, though this is probably intentional). For example you can eventually upgrade the gun upgrader guy to reroll most lower rarity guns for free. This enables you to basically perfect an early-game weapon quite easily especially if you're willing to restart until you start with a good blue gun. It may not carry you to Victory but it'll at least get you to the final few maps which is where it becomes insanely easy to find a powerful weapon.

TLDR: If dozens of hours of gameplay are your idea of money well spent, I'd skip this game. If you're okay spending $25 on a short game (=<20hrs), then I'd recommend this game.

Update context:
I'm on ""Guardian 3"" difficulty, which is essentially ""reincarnation levels"" if you play Gunfire, except there's only 4 Guardian levels currently.
Initially, I said there's a large variety of builds. But, now that I'm at the end game... I see there aren't. You can't play any 'ol build and expect to win with all S's (this game's ranking system for biomes completed). I've beat Gunfire Reborn's Reincarnation Level 9, solo, but I'm stuck on G3 here. I'm not having fun anymore, trying to beat all 4 Guardian difficulty levels in RoboQuest. I think the time I already invested in the game was worth $25, but I don't foresee myself playing this game much longer. 


Original review:
Borderlands meets Gunfire Reborn meets Doom. Do note: Roboquest doesn't strike me as a very deep game, though. My ""thumbs up"" review is because I'm happy to spend $25 on a game that isn't very deep, but is really fun for the 10-20hrs I do put into it.

It's more FPS-focused than Gunfire, I'd say. BUT.. you can definitely make OP builds. I saw another review mention how it's just FPS-focused and you can't really build much variety. But you can! Each class seems to have at least 3-4 different routes you can take.

Movement felt clunky at first, and I was instantly afraid I wouldn't like the game. But, once I got the hang of it, movement actually feels pretty good. You can slide and sprint, and you have a double-jump right from the start. There's also a fun rail system that adds to mobility; chaining rail slides and jumps+slides is fun.

I like how many things there are to unlock via exploration and collection and discoveries. There's lots of doors you can't get past, but they'll keep unlocking as you find the ""keys"" needed. Each door adds something to the game and/or run.

I'm not sure about replay-ability, I only just now got to the final boss for the first time (I've got ~4hrs of play time not on record, so about 12hrs for me to unlock progression to even reach the final boss).


Overall, I think this is worth $25. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes any of the 3 games I mentioned. The dev/s did a great job.",1700419989,1703206226,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lots of secrets/routes, great weapon variety, fantastic class variety, satisfying gameplay, speedy movement, mechanical depth, secrets and alternate routes through the game - Roboquest has it all. You have a sprint, a slide, grinding on rails for extra speed, jumping on enemies' heads for melee damage while shooting other enemies or reloading. Enemies stagger after taking enough damage or Impact. You've got Borderlands-esque weapons with random effects/affixes of different qualities. You've got elemental damage systems. You've got some classes with rocket jumps, some with melee attacks, one that summons minions, etc etc. And, of course, items to grant you more buffs.

I played in Early Access until I had beaten everything that was available at the time, and have come back to it recently for the full release. I was surprised at how stellar the felt in Early Access, and the game has managed to pleasantly surprised me again somehow coming back to it now. 

Probably my only gripe is that when you haven't picked up a weapon yet, you can't see how big the magazine size is from the stats pop up, only that it's a mag type weapon vs an energy type weapon. Unless I'm missing something. That is probably the worst thing about the game for me, and it's pretty minor.

Roboquest is probably a 9/10 game for me personally at the moment, and could probably grow into a 10/10 as I play it more and discover the rest of the game. Co-op is a blast, but most of my time has just been spent in single player.",1703146350,1703146350,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unlike in EA, enemies now drop weapons regularly.

The major flaw of RoboQuest is you can't manually save your progress which is really annoying. The game auto-save whenever you're back in your basecamp but that's all.

Another flaw are the musics. It's some cheap and generic wannabe 90' techno and tiresome drum and bass. They give headaches in ten minutes.

Gameplay-wise, metaprogression is handled by a perk tree and finding in-game hidden gadgets which are either niche (minor healing, in-run currency) or absolute game changers (jetpack/grappling hook). There's also side quests. This feels fun and impactful as well as providing direction for earlier runs.

Balance on higher difficulties feels a bit off but nothing major. Mostly how well each class can handle that one attack in the second phase of the final boss, the viability of heavy weapons, and the S-rank time for quarry.

To be fair, there aren't many games in this sub-genre, but Roboquest already surpasses the outstanding Gunfire Reborn by miles. The controls are extremely responsive and at no point (unless you're playing co-op) do you ever feel like you've been unfairly hit by an enemy. There are many secrets to unlock and many mechanics to figure out. The variety of weapons is outstanding, many weapons can be extremely useful depending on their stats. The 6 robots to play have many different upgrade options and are very different to play.

The only thing that slightly spoiled my enjoyment of the game was an obviously buggy achievement. This will be important for some achievement hunters. I don't think this is a spoiler at all, but if you really don't want to know anything about the game, don't read any further:

There is an achievement called 'Master Gambler' and I can absolutely promise you, this achievement definitely does not work the way it should mathematically. You have a 25% chance if you pick up a specific item that you will get ""an effect"" and the achievement that comes with it. However, I have specifically picked up the item (without exaggerating) about 70 - 80 times and got it when I almost given up hope. 

A friend with whom I played most of the game received ""the effect"" of the item once after 47 hours of play, although he almost always selected the item once he had completed it. I reported the bug, but have not received any feedback to date. For all future players, I can only hope that the developers will address this issue. 
It's a shame that an otherwise flawless game has a bug like this that has never been fixed after all this time.

In a game like Deadlink or Doom Eternal, the risk of diving into a pack of enemies is offset by the potential reward. In Deadlink in particular, HP is split between shields, which are easily replenished, and health, which is more difficult to regain. Roboquest uses a grey health mechanic instead, with recently lost HP being easier to recover. Unfortunately this means it's almost never worth risking health. With a shield/HP mechanic, you can take more risks when your shields are full, and play more defensively when your shields are gone. In Roboquest play becomes more and more cautious as your health reserves deplete.

The class abilities lack impact. The engineer class, for instance, gets two drones that deal damage to random enemies, and can absorb fire, but you have no control over them. This means they are effectively a passive increase in damage and HP. You also get a rocket you can chain inbetween weapon reloads. Contrast this to other engineer classes in games like Deadlink or Deep Rock Galactic. In those, the engineer deploys a static turret, and thus has to think about positioning. There's often a way to take direct control of the turret, and both Deadlink and Deep Rock have additional abilities to supplement the turret.

Finally, we have a lack of interaction between players in co-op. There are *some* abilities that you can get through random drops, such as a deployable forceshield, that encourage cooperative play - but most of the time you're playing independently. Even reviving downed players often isn't worth it, as they'll revive automatically anyway and it costs half your HP to do so.",1702406587,1702406587,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Often overshadowed by bigger franchises, this indie marvel deserves a spotlight for its captivating gameplay, engaging mechanics, and a delightful blend of old-school charm and modern design.

Graphics and Art Style:
Robo Quest may not boast AAA graphics, but what it lacks in hyper-realism, it compensates with a vibrant and retro-inspired aesthetic. The pixel art is not just nostalgic; it's a deliberate choice that enhances the game's overall character. The visuals are clean, crisp, and effectively convey the game's futuristic world without unnecessary frills.

Gameplay Mechanics:
At the core of Robo Quest lies its addictive and finely tuned gameplay. This roguelike first-person shooter seamlessly combines the best of classic shooters with modern mechanics. The controls are intuitive, and the fluid movement makes navigating through the various levels a joy. What sets Robo Quest apart is its emphasis on skill-based combat, requiring players to master their arsenal and adapt to the ever-evolving challenges of procedurally generated levels.

Character Development and Customization:
One of the standout features of Robo Quest is its extensive character development and customization options. Players can choose from a diverse cast of characters, each with unique abilities and playstyles. The game's upgrade system allows for meaningful progression, ensuring that each run feels like a step toward becoming a powerhouse. The variety of weapons and equipment adds depth to the experience, encouraging experimentation to find the perfect loadout.

Replayability:
The roguelike nature of Robo Quest ensures that no two playthroughs are the same. The procedurally generated levels keep the experience fresh, while the plethora of character builds and weapon combinations add immense replay value. The desire to uncover hidden secrets and discover optimal strategies fuels the urge to dive back into the game repeatedly.

Community Engagement and Developer Support:
Despite its relatively modest following, the Robo Quest community is passionate and dedicated. The developers' commitment to regularly updating the game with new content, addressing player feedback, and fostering an active community is commendable. It's clear that the creators are invested in the game's success and the satisfaction of their player base.

Conclusion:
Robo Quest may be a hidden gem, but its brilliance shines through for those willing to give it a chance. The combination of engaging gameplay, nostalgic aesthetics, and a commitment to player satisfaction makes it a standout title in the crowded gaming landscape. If you're a fan of roguelike shooters or simply appreciate a well-crafted indie game, Robo Quest deserves a spot in your library.

It's most similar to Gunfire Reborn if you've played that game but with enough differences to make it a truly unique experience that stands out on it's own.

It blends exploration and meta-progression with Roguelike in a new way that's fresh and interesting.

The combat is so good too. The weapons each have their own unique strengths and playstyles that make them fun. The 6 classes all have several builds that let you play them in unique ways. Many roguelikes try to achieve this level of gameplay variance and this game does so effortlessly. The combat fundamentals of movement and shooting are outstanding quality too. Once you make it further in the game and unlock more core abilities it just gets even more fun.

The level design is brilliant. The limited budget/focus on story and cutscenes fits the game and still makes an impact with very limited scenes and dialog. The art style is unique and serves the game well.

The only way I could think to improve this game is to give me more! More cool stages. More cool bosses. More classes etc. At about 30 hours we've completed the game a few time and while it's still fun to play it feels like we've seen it all.

The only minor gripe I'd have is to rethink the last boss. [Spoiler]It's easy to cheese past a majority of the mechanics using the grappling hook. This is required if you're using a melee build. I think maybe the last boss needs some platforms to stand on that give unique mechanics or something for melee. In fact, once you get the grappling hook / jetpack you can cheese the bosses quite a bit in general. [/spoiler]

from the summer update in July to version 1.00
The game has addressed 90% of the issues I had with it. 
There is tons of content, characters are diverse and have deep builds and the weapons are way more interesting. A good amount of progression and things to grind towards but I think you can 100% the game fairly quickly trying (15-20 hours?) 

old review posted below.


Been playing since 0.4 I believe, 
TLDR;
Cons:
-Roguelike elements are there, but do not feel impactful or exciting to acquire.
-Core system feels very under cooked despite (I think) 2 reworks.
-Relatively easy/quick to unlock all of the permanent unlocks in the basecamp.(8 hours I think?)
-Basecamp unlocks aren't exciting and slightly convoluted.
-Rail system is cool but kinda wish it was a bit more present.

Pros: 
+Gunplay and movement feels great
+Tons of guns, most of them are very fun to use. Love the secondary fire addition to a lot of the weapons. Would love if they all had that.
+4 classes to choose from which are all unique(wish there was a class progression system tho. A reason to keep playing them)
+Each level is quite cool and well designed. Love the vibe of most of them. Hoping they add a reason to go to each specific level(Maybe a specific buff attributed to each region that stays with you for the whole run?)

In roguelike games, choices should matter and in Roboquest it feels way too forgiving and easy to switch builds within a moments notice. I dont think that your run should be ""ruined"" because of one or two choices, but every act you have the opportunity to just try a different build(and it feels encouraged to do so because weapons have a star system aka level, you should be using higher stared weapons). Level up upgrades are pretty close to perfect with this last update, I think that is the most fun part to choose from. Core passive bonus's are very lackluster with the passive bonus's given I also think all passive core bonus's should stack, or they should have random affix's similar to the levelup upgrades. Roboquest as a kind of session based borderlands game is great. As a roguelike FPS it is missing a lot, and feels like it is having an identity crisis.
I like Roboquest quite a bit and Im being overcritical out of love <3

it has so many F you(s) with a developer middle finger poking you in the eye, subjectively speaking, that I just can't enjoy myself any more.

you all see the glowing reviews by the people who just take bad game design as long as it has nice visuals and some things are good otherwise, so I won't repeat what's right with the game. 
what's not constantly mentioned is the theme, which I really really enjoy and I wish most of these idiotic Doom clones would stop putting me into hell to fight demons or some nonsense. I'm not 15 any more and that shit is just obnoxious.
the game has a cheerful attitude and if it didn't have that, I'd have quit after 30 minutes and gave it a bad review.

what breaks the game for me is the despawning loot. after seconds, it's gone. that turns to nonstop annoyance when you constantly watch stuff you need despawn,
the best games on the market are those that let you play how you want. this game forces you to melee half the enemies cause otherwise your energy cells (which you need for upgrades) and health orbs (and potentially even the massively important wrenches?) despawn within seconds. 

I waited to see if there's unlocks that could remedy what I despise about this game design, but there was nothing, and I think the petulant dev thinks he's a genius by repeating the worst design choices from other even worse games.

I know, calling the guy petulant won't help, but reading his replies to things makes it VERY clear this guy will never ever listen to any feedback ever. and if he does, he'll double down, just to stick it to you. he strikes me as *that* kind of guy.

it's unbearably infuriating that such good mood and visuals are paired with 90% horrible gun play, this fun-police loot system and the dev's obsession with making you his bitch by never ever giving you the one gun you actually enjoy using. or the one element you want to use.
or anything really.

this game is essentially the Unreal engine / 3D version of the early pixel art games: they sucked (except terraria), but people have them raving reviews, because they liked the style.

I played 8h and WANTED SO HARD to enjoy this game but it's just dog shit. you hope that there's some time when the game stops fuccing with you, and just lets you ""play the game"", but that time never comes.
you're drowned in unusable guns, in despawning loot, and microscopic meta progression that does not really seem to add much.

in some way, it is amazing that I kept playing for so long because I really assumed this could not be the intended design. this some typical ""make it a big hurdle so it feels even better when you get past it"" kind of design. but it wasn't. it's just a dev fuccing with you",1702159047,1702159047,False,0,2,0.32467535138130188,0,True,False,False

Personally, I really struggled to stay engaged after a few hours and decided to ultimately move on. The actual shooting and movement is smooth and enjoyable, but there are a lot of problems around that core gameplay. Aesthetically, the art design and environments have a nice, clean look, but the style can be generic at times and the arenas themselves are often really small and blend together quickly. But most importantly, I think this game suffers from the same issue a lot of FPS rougelites do - because your equipment isn't determined in advance, every weapon has to work ""good enough"" in every situation, and as a result encounters just start to blend together and you rarely get into a situation where you feel any pressure to branch out. 

In classic FPS games like Doom or Dusk, the level designer can depend on you having a particular weapon at a particular time, and that means enemy types and locations can be designed in ways that force you to rely on your entire arsenal. But here, it felt like I could approach any arena with any weapon, and as a result I basically just played the game the same way every time. I found myself regularly switching weapons or using abilities not because the situation actually required me to, but because I wanted to force myself to get some variety. And ironically, the game really reinforces this by throwing *so many* new weapons at you every moment, which just makes it more obvious how similar the combat loop actually is each time. I realize this is sorta baked in to the basic structure of the game, but I still wish they'd taken some more steps to push players towards creative engagement in ways that differentiate different equipment more. As it stands, runs are enjoyable but they quickly start to feel the same unless you really go out of your way to seek out novelty. I think there are a lot of people who don't mind doing that, but for me, it really got in the way of me enjoying things.",1702146633,1702146790,False,17,1,0.601221561431884766,0,True,False,False

They really done it. They went above and beyond my expectation with this game. I've been playing it in and out since the early access, but now with the actual release of the game, all that potential I was talking about has been unleashed. Updating this review as I unlocked all achievements for the game.

Things I LIKE:
- The game has a lot of fun weapons. I love all the robots (classes), they provide different ways of playing the game, even with the same robot, you have more than one possible way of playing around it.
- The exploration feels very satisfying. The puzzles are also a nice touch to some of the unlocks and they don't feel over-welcomed.
- I love how they made the gadgets a toggle and ALL usable, instead of having to pick in only 2 or 3.
- The movement feels soooooo smooth. Sliding, double (or triple) jumping, grappling hook, jet pack, hero landing, all of it feels natural.
- The game feels harder compared to the Early Access, but in a good way. It is challenging, but never felt unfair.
- The net-code is amazing. Been playing with a friend and we are having a blast. Only had issues of disconnection once, but that was probably our own ISP fault, and not the game. Haven't tried playing with someone from another country, but with a close friend, it is flawless.
- The OST is really good, always keeping you hyped for the stages and boss fights.
- The game performance is also one of the highlights here. I don't think I've ever dropped frames in this game or had a stutter, it simply WORKS.


Thins I DISLIKE or would like to see changes:
- Going for museum completion feels a little boring. You just keep on spamming runs until you finally find the items you're missing. The cards with the artists are really helpful for weapons and mobs (Thank you!), but the Bazaar takes a while to complete.
- The achievement for using the Bonk Hammer on Diggy Mole should specify that you need to use ONLY the hammer to kill the boss. Doing only the final hit won't count.
- I have a small issue with the auto-run option, where sometimes it will go back to only walking. I still haven't figured what triggers it. It's a minor annoyance that doesn't make the game any worse, but still present sometimes.


I'd say this game is definitely worth a purchase if you are into roguelikes and FPS games, specially ones with more movement options. The game does feel hard at the begin, even at the Standard difficulty, but not unfair, and as you unlock more movement options, things becomes easier and even more satisfying to pull off. In the end, it's an addicting formula of movement and satisfying gunplay.

------------------------------------

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:
So far the game is REALLY fun. The gameplay after a few minutes already feels really natural and responsive. Of course since it's early access, there's not much content. Once you've completed the game, you pretty much have to complete it again on a harder difficulty.

I'm really looking forward for how the developers will treat and update this game, it sure has A LOT of potential.",1598776872,1701878172,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Previously upgrades were found in items that boosted a colored stat that would boost damage and if I recall correctly give addition effects at certain amounts. Now, seemingly from the success of gunfire reborn, that system was completely removed in favor of a system like the scrolls. I think that change was for the worse as it removed what made roboquests guns and upgrades unique while adding very uninteresting passive. I played a run in the current version where I got a passive upgrade that made it so when I used my primary ability there was a 10% chance for my movement controls to be inverted in a movement shooter.

I have unlocked almost everything in the game (only need like 2 more things) and then I've got all the goodies. Thankfully I got it on sale but full price its about $2 per hour of gameplay. What you get though is a decently polished indie experience. There isnt really anything fancy about the cutscenes but the game has its jokes and its quirks and it makes it feel like a kind of joyful adventure. 

This ties into my next point about the music, and dont get me wrong the music is good... but... the clearly doom inspired metal vibe for combat etc is just too cliche for me when its combined with the extreme juxtaposition of the rest of the soundtrack, like it was put there for you to stop and go OMG THEY DID WHAT DOOM DID... but after hearing so many indie games do this it just falls flat for me.  Like I said though, the music isn't bad, its just not really inspired, unique and lacks a connection to the actual gameplay.

Ultimately pick this up on a sale if you want a fairly short roguelite, its a decent game to play solo or with a friend.

Kinda a spoiler but I think its important to know if you're used to rogues like hades/deadcells etc:  [spoiler] Unlike games like Deadcells or Hades there isnt anything different about the game after you beat it the first time except for a new difficulty level.

Some of my gripes with the movement:
The grappling hook currently feels like a hook shot from zelda, which is boring to me. IMO it would feel way better if it functioned more like Loader's grappling hook in risk of rain 2, for example. So letting you swing from it and click a button to let go. Right now using it pulls you straight to it's grapple-point, killing your momentum. So using it actually feels bad. Luckily you can ignore it entirely :)
The rail-grinding feels janky and unrewarding, the way it locks to a speed and bases the direction you grind purely on the direction you faced when landing, NOT your momentum when landing, so grinding feels choppy the way it changes your monentum instantly.
I think not giving the player so many jumps and a free jetpack all the time, and then fixing rails and the grappling hook, + maybe a wall running mechanic(?) would be crazy fun. Though this would probably lead to a huge balance being necessary, because combat now is balanced around you being able to fly over and kite enemies/projectiles extremely efficiently. Or it would make the game a lot harder. (which I am also not opposed to)

Dozens of base weapons with random modifiers - the Typhoon Minigun will always be an energy weapon with slowdown while firing and homing projectiles, but in some runs it might deal fire damage and in others the projectiles might bounce. Items aren't randomized and give minor perks. Might give ice weapons bonus critical damage, or shock nearby enemies, or give a triple jump. There's also corrupted items with a downside - so, 12% damage resist but 12% less movespeed. You can see what an item does before you pick it up, so there's less of a barrier to entry than something like Risk of Rain.
Unlike most roguelites you also level up at a baseline. There's six classes each with two abilities, and most level-up skills are unique between classes, or shared with one other class. Sometimes this will interact with an ability - making a thrown spear also mark enemies for bonus damage - and other times it'll impact base gameplay - infusing all weapons with elemental damage of a certain type. Also unlike most roguelites there isn't really a ""god run"". You'll never get items and weapons so good that you can just AFK through combat or blindly shoot a wall and let splash damage clear everything for you. You'll always have to dodge attacks and aim to some extent.
You get ranked not just on difficulty but on speed and kill percentage. This'll give you more powercells (currency) to use during a run, and also gives bragging rights for a full S-rank max difficulty run. That's a large part of the replayability for this game, though - experimentation with builds for better times on higher difficulties. The random generation alone unfortunately isn't robust enough for that to give as much variety. You'll recognize the overall layouts very fast, even if the specifics are a little different. Another issue: the game has a lot of meta-progression. Not, like, Binding of Isaac where you're checking off 500 completion marks, but closer to Hades where you get a *lot* of direct upgrades as you do more and more runs. It doesn't take that long to actually unlock everything (I had basically all meta-progression in under 15 hours), but it means you're probably never beating this game on Hard on your first run. And the higher difficulties especially just outright assume you have basically everything unlocked for you to even put up a fight.
Still, there's a good amount of really good game here, especially if you're a big Doom or Ultrakill fan. Just don't expect quite that level of perfection.",1701763534,1701763534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not deep like I thought It would be (I must admit, I expected better from the signs given in EA) but still, a nice rogue-lite FPS. Sure, it becomes repetitive after a while (a little too soon, if you ask me) and the game doesn't give you enough reason to go on.. BUT still, an enjoyable game for all those who love shooting without any more deeper gameplay... If it wasn't clear, I'm giving the thumbs up buuuuuut I'm more prone for a ''mixed review''... but (again) that'd be unjust: the game is perfectly enjoyable, even without any particular features.

This game is the closest we have to a procedurally generated boomer shooter, despite several design decisions that steer it away from being a ""purebred"" one; mainly, you can only have two weapons, and the maps are often narrower than the usual arena.

Despite that, the game has a well-executed focus on mobility and its RPG elements, which play to the roguelite elements perfectly, creating a very original experience. Add a heavy and powerful soundtrack that plays constantly through the levels, and the whole experience feels almost hypnotic; I did NOT notice I played this for 24 hours, I can tell you that much.

This is the best FPS roguelite I ever played, and it came really close to being a GOTY contender. Here is hoping for a bolder and more ambitious Roboquest 2, as well as a strong recommendation that you buy this game regardless of your usual predilections, as this is an easy game to sit down and play for several hours.",1701708486,1701708486,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Where you have to get 230 kills with all weapons, small chance for a monster to drop that species' card, have to encounter every upgrade, find all secrets and data logs, and collect all the power shards to fully complete the museum. And also the fact that once you beat the game in hard mode you unlock the guardian difficulties giving it a pretty tough challenge keeps me practicing to beat them. And also the rank system making you perfect every run/level makes it a even harder to 100% beat them keeps me more hooked to perfect every level. Amazing game I would consider it a mix of Get to the Orange Door and Enter the gungeon, but I prefer this game by a long shot. I have invested more time in both of those other games i mention combined, due to it's fun replay-ability.

1) You are presented almost immediately with speed bonuses for completing a level and at the same time you have to look for stuff losing precious time. I was very conflicted by this, but I had to choose what I wanted to do and focus on it. Ultimately this decision carried me through the first half.
2) Also I was very conflicted by the head bonk mechanic at first since you don't have a lot of movement options to utilize it. But with all the upgrades, it now feels natural to do most of the times.

I don't have a ton of playtime, but from what I have seen, the gameplay is fantastic, but feels shallow. Each gun is fun to use and the movement is great, but I never felt like any of the 'roguelite' choices I made had any effect. The upgrades are miniscule effects like 15% damage to flying enemies or 15% bonus melee damage or random things like that which were ultimately inconsequential. 

I also felt like the gameplay, while great on the surface, never really changed. They did add more enemies on the full release, but it's still the same stuff overall and you will be replaying many of the zones over and over again. This repetition wouldn't be a problem if the upgrade system lead to unique builds or the weapons lead to very distinct playstyles, but it's mostly just run and gun. 

A game that I think is similar but performs better in my opinion as a roguelike is Gunfire Reborn. The characters in Gunfire to me feel vastly different and actually have different playstyles and builds that make meaningful effects on the gameplay so even replaying the same floors over and over again can feel fresh.

- Game replay is enormous, and consistently fun.
- Character build diversity is crazy

- Early feel of needing a grapple tied into the movement system was later resolved with getting better and gadget unlocks.
- Needs a run save option
- Needs a run history option
- No reconnect option in co-op disconnects
- Some weapons/builds/paths feel much stronger, so further balancing required
- Game rewards good aim -> crit build on all classes -> bit repetitive
- Looking forward to more/future content updates

[list]
[*]You get new abilities/passives less often, which can feel a bit limiting when you're looking forward to making a synchronizing build.
[*] It looks like enemy damage and health doesn't simply infinitely scale like it does in Gunfire. 
[*] Levels are a lot more detailed and feel more dynamic and vertical. The branching paths to different areas, each with their own requirements to progress to them, allows for even more exploration and progression. The lore of the game is hidden behind exploring the level to find hidden data pods, which also help towards meta-progression.
[*] Co-op doesn't feel as unbalanced based on different levels of progression (the meta-progression revolves more around giving you more options to take instead of flat buffs. Though there are still flat buffs within it, the buffs, so far as I've played, are a lot less minor, giving you utility over flat damage increases). In addition, the netcode doesn't seem to be delay-based, as you often find with co-op shooters.

The shooting mechanics and ""game feel,"" are truly incredible and if you liked doom or ultrakill you'll probably have a good time here.

I will say the main rough-like mechanics are a little underwhelming. It has similar weapon mechanics to dead-cells and a problem both games share, is that it's more temping to use a weapon you're used to, which leads to less run variety. Same goes for the level up perks, except unlike the weapons, which are all mostly viable, some of the perks can be down right useless it seems. 

Progression is also kinda strange in my opinion. The exploration is decently fun. I had a good time searching for a bunch of secerct areas and unlocking the elementalist (the games ""seceret"" character). I do have a dislike for rough-likes that almost require pre-run upgrades to get by. Don't get me wrong, if you're skilled enough you could beat the final boss on any difficulty without even touching the workbench, but upgrades are required for obtaining better weapons early game and late game as well as a major contributor to run variety. I can see a decent amount of people getting bored on the first few hours due to this and not waiting for it to ""get good.""

Praise to the glorious sound track and visuals too.

I do think this game has potential, especially judging by the devs. They made slight changes to the progression system from the early assess version to the 1.0 version and decided that it'd be a great idea to reset everyone's progression. Needless to say ""gamers had upsetty."" And despite stating a reason (they said they wanted everyone to experience the ""new"" progression system) they gave everyone effected the option to get there stuff back. To me this displays a they have good/basic understanding of how to please the player base and gives me optimism for them to listen to us players in the future.

(Also if ur a pc nut DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I have a pretty decent graphics card and I keep getting studders. This leads me to believe the game isn't very well optimized and my hope is this will get addressed)",1701466334,1701466334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Roboquest could best be best described as a mix between Gunfire Reborn and Doom Eternal, borrowing the combat pace from the latter (as well as a few movement mechanics from the likes of Titanfall 2 which really rounds out your options from A to B) and the run building and randomised highly variable upgrades and weapons from the former. 

Having 100%-ed the game and all achievements at the time of writing, the amount of content may not be on par with either of the aforementioned games, however the movement and shooting mechanics are so polished and engaging that it's easy to find yourself picking the game up again to scratch the itch that only it can. 

Pair this with the excellent soundtrack produced by noisecream (featuring drum and bass, hard high bpm electronic and even some metal thrown in for good measure) and the experience comes together to completely justify the price of picking it up.

Final score is a solid robo out of quest.

On the one hand, Roboquest's moment-to-moment gameplay is very satisfying and has very solid gunplay and weapon variety. But on the other, it's also utterly shallow and there's a lot that hasn't improved since Early Access.

Considering the game has Overwhelmingly Positive reviews, I'm going to have to focus on the biggest negatives, since any positives I can list are dead air and reiteration of what's been said a thousand times.

- The weapon variety is good, but several of the weapons really need some help. Kaboom Grenade not detonating on contact with an enemy is genuinely baffling; I can't tell if it's a bug or not.

- The game is chock-full of so many boring, impactless upgrades. I know stacking 5 +% damage modifiers is going to have some compounding results, but it doesn't change how utterly BORING it all is. There's nothing like Gunfire's modifiers that really alter how certain weapons behave (like changing some weapons to a two-shot that either refunds the first bullet on kill, or gets a huge damage boost with the last shot); the best you can hope for is an alt-fire that basically just acts like a really dummy-simple weapon stapled to your main one.

- The gadget unlocks are horrendous now. It used to be that you unlocked gadgets by upgrading the basecamp, which gave you incentive to keep playing and always gave you something tangible to work towards; even if you lost a lot of runs early on, the wrenches still ultimately contributed towards new gadgets, so you'd eventually get them all just by playing. Now, you have to actively seek them out through ""side-quests"", though calling them ""quests"" is seriously disingenuous. There's no story to them, there's no journey, there's no substance. You bring a thing to an NPC, they give you a gadget; it's awful.

I could spend the rest of this review slagging off this new unlocking method...so I will. One of the NPCs requires you to show him a specific weapon (randomly determined, but doesn't change run-to-run). This game has enough guns that getting it to show up might take a half-dozen tries or more, then you have to actually bring it to him, and he's a few stages deep, so if it's a weapon you hate using, you'll be playing with one hand tied behind your back. So you finally manage to bring it to him, and...not only does he give you nothing, but he has the gall to ask you to bring him another weapon (once again, randomly determined). Since you can't do ANY backtracking at all or looping, you have to just restart the whole run to try to bring this idiot another weapon.

So another half-dozen or more runs, you get the weapon and bring it to him, and you know what happens? Not only do you not get a gadget, but HE WANTS YOU TO BRING HIM ANOTHER WEAPON. This a-hole wants you to show him THREE WEAPONS in total. DEAR GOD, I wanted so badly to be able to just kill him and take his gadget off his body. This is holding a significant gameplay aspect (a gadget, AKA a permanent run modifier) hostage behind a godawful RNG grind.

This is unbelievably bad design, and this is just for ONE gadget. Good luck getting all of the gadgets without a guide open at all times.

So, if you're wondering, yes, I am in fact giving the game a thumbs down almost entirely off of the back of the gadget unlocks. The early access method of unlocking them as your base was upgraded was FINE, this was a completely unnecessary change made purely for the sake of change. Trash this entire ""quest"" non-system and go back to the early access method, and this review immediately swings to a thumbs up.",1701461818,1701461818,False,1,1,0.482352942228317261,0,True,False,False

I love how there's always something to work towards whether you're just playing for the first time or have been playing for over 14 hours. I honestly don't have any bad to say about this except those damn tiny explosive robots keep catching me slacking lmao

The graphics are a lot like Borderlands, the gameplay is very similar to Gunfire Reborn, and the difficulty is almost of a souls like (almost) and it just blends all those things together in a refined way.",1701038685,1701413014,True,1,0,0.503105580806732178,1,True,False,False

(My playtime is wrong, not sure why steam just decided not to track it, I had 3 hours before refunding)

There is very little content actually here and the levels repeat often, far more often than a game like Risk of Rain 2 (another roguelite). 

The balancing also seems to have gotten way off since I last played it, now being even more difficult fairly early on meaning that if you dont end up RNG rolling the best meta weapons early on you might as well just restart cause the run is doomed to fail. Even the positive reviews are mentioning how many of the weapons are straight up useless.

RNG is this games other problem. Going back to Risk of Rain, they have RNG rolls too but because they're frequent a bad one doesn't hit too hard. If you get a bad one here you feel it for a while and sometimes can't recover at all because of the aforementioned sometimes useless weapons.

Overall its not a bad game, but considering they just raised the price for the 1.0 release, it has to be compared to other games at that price point and it doesn't hold up to them IMO. It relies on RNG but lacks balanced RNG choices and lacks a variety of levels ensuring repetitiveness fairly quickly.

I frankly don't understand the positive reviews, it deserves some for sure but not 90%+
it makes a little more sense when you realise most of them have very few hours on the game. Over half of the reviews didn't even play past 6-7 hours.

The only roguelite I’ve ever really enjoyed has been Vampire Survivors, which I’ve often seen referred to as ‘digital crack’.

Well, if VS is digital crack, then Roboquest is digital speed.

Roboquest mixes frenzied run ‘n’ gun gameplay with extremely enjoyable movement and a deep selection of weapons and upgrades available for obsessively tweaking the perfect build.

The wide variety of guns ensures you can always try something else if you’re bored of a weapon, although I have my favorites (scout sniper <3). The pocket reload mechanic, time-graded levels, and Doom Eternal-esque health pickup system favor fast-paced gameplay, which goes hand in hand with the frenetic movement system.

Sliding, slide jumping, double jumping, rails (think Sunset Overdrive), and a gamut of unlockable movement items make movement a dream in this game. I haven’t enjoyed traversing a game world this much since playing Ghostrunner, whose gameplay focuses entirely on its parkour. Not to mention how fun it is to headbonk (goomba stomp) robots.

What ties this addictive loop together are the roguelite meta-progression and the upgrade system, the latter of which also levels the playing field when it comes to gameplay. The game heavily favors skilled twitch shooting with its critical system and fast-paced nature, but you can’t breeze through the game on aiming skills alone. You need to craft a well-thought-out build if you want to beat the game on higher difficulties with S-tier time, but at the same time, the game allows you to experiment with unorthodox builds and weapons (e.g. [spoiler][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAvqn1Lvn7U]shovel only[/url][/spoiler]). Still, the game requires more skill and engagement than a game like Vampire Survivors, where at a certain point in your build you just watch numbers go up while hitting WASD randomly (which, to be fair, is also very dopamine producing, hence ‘digital crack’).

I’ve played other roguelite shooters like Risk of Rain 2, but they did not draw me in as much as Roboquest has. I’ve just started the game, and instead of focusing on beating it with my favorite build (Ranger/crit/ricochet OP) I’ve been distracted by finding secrets, trying out different builds and weapons, seeing what cool builds other players have beat the game with, and of course, slide jumping through levels like a [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNvDUO42Hys]robotic phoon[/url].

I do wish some parts of the progression weren’t gated behind secrets, because I feel like if I haven’t found them at a certain point, I’m handicapping myself. Other than that, I purchased it on release and the game has run great, I’ve experienced no bugs, the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2AUlcq1huA]soundtrack is awesome[/url], and I find the cartoony cel-shaded art style very endearing (the little 2D animated cutscenes that play with each new level are very cool too). Mix this with the addictive nature of both the gameplay and the ‘one more run’ roguelite meta-progression, and you have a gem on your hands. Can’t wait to eventually beat it on Guardian IV, and I’m hoping there’s DLC, a sequel, or any form of Roboquest content announced in the future, although this game will keep me very busy in the meantime.

Gunplay: 3/10 feels like im using wet toilet paper on a calculator, which I understand is part of the balancing but it don't feel good

Ill be waiting for some updates before I recommend this one, doesn't feel like im making progress right now

Update 1: The damage isn't the worst, and the modifiers on the weapons are a great start to fix it! I would say the game is still light on content (for the asking price) but the devs are quickly catching up, and it is great fun to see their speedy progress.

Update 2: LORDY the improvements, love the shooting mechanics now and it runs a bit smoother too! Wonderful too see!

Update 3 0.05.0: Every update is a hop and a soaring leap better than the last! totally worth the price in its current state! Devs listen and are quick to implement new ideas!! 9/10 cant wait for it to be 10/10

Update 4 0.8.3: New weapons, areas, and secrets that aren't pulling down my spanking me? The flexibility in builds is quite nice its really fun seeing and playing the new content as it comes out!

Update 5: Fucking makes me wet and sticky like a certified FREAK... So much looter shooter fun in a bite size time commitment!!!

Update 6: I haven't been able to play for the last several updates regardless of PC or how many times I redownload it!!

When you are in a transitional area of a level (there will be a lot of these moments where you are taking a break from the fighting to level up, heal, and purchase new items), the soundtrack loops unobtrusively in a low energy part of the song. But the moment you step out those doors and all the enemies turn to look at you, the song immediately has a high energy drop to instantly make you feel like the DOOM Slayer again. Seriously, look up a gameplay video so you can see what I'm talking about, it's very satisfying!

Beyond that, the game oozes style. The visual design is sort of reminiscent of Borderlands games, with inking around character models, bold comic-book-y color palettes, and a scrap-punk aesthetic. The gunplay and movement feel really tight and responsive. I've only played kbm, so I'm not sure what controller support is like, but I'm guessing it probably plays better with mouse-like aim. The enemy variety feels really good.

I only have two critique, and they're pretty minor. First, balance. There are several perk options for each class that are fun, versatile, and powerful, making it easy to want to take them when offered. Unfortunately, there are also a number of perk options that I'll only ever take once just to fill out the catalogue. It's to be expected that not every option in a roguelike is going to be equally good, or equally good in all scenarios, but I do hope that the devs will make some small tweaks here and there so certain classes feel more consistently fun (Elementalist probably being the most affected by this).

Second is that there's no way to see what build components are available to your character in the middle of a run. If you've ever played Enter the Gungeon, think of the Ammonomicon being available in the pause menu. I would really like to see the devs add a way to check what perks, items, and weapons are available to you without having to alt-tab out to the wiki in your web browser.

Overall I definitely recommend this game. Maybe 8-9/10?",1701186292,1701186292,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite the, odd, ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews, the game doesn't have much to offer but the same ol' thing over and over and over again with very little in the way of changing playstyle. The best weapons are the best weapons, even if those weapons are low tier, they're still better than most high tier of any other weapon. Don't get that weapon? Lol. Sorry? 

The ""upgrades"" from the basecamp (the thing that makes this a roguelite) are basically useless. Sure, they add a little help but not a whole lot. Many of the ""upgrades"" are to increase the chance that you'll get, for example, higher level or higher tier weapons, but despite putting ""wrenches"" into those, they don't seem to work all that well. I remember the 2nd upgrade to the 'increase weapon rarity' was followed by 3 whites, 1 green, none of which were the good weapons. 

This game appears to really center around achievement hounds who just want to ""beat"" or ""finish"" everything. For example, you can get a battle buddy that is absolutely useless. But, it's there. For no real reason. You can trade out a weapon slot (you only get 2) for it but, yeah, it really isn't good. Go ahead, level him up .... use up those power cells. It still sucks but, you did it! Yay you. 

The game play really is solid, though. The graphics are pretty killer. But, the mechanics of the game leave much to be desired and you'll end up just doing the same levels over and over and over and over and over again just to ""get that thing that sucks."" 

If I were you, I wouldn't spend more than $14.99 on the game. It's not worth $25, imo. There's just not enough there. I've played 14 hours and actually reached the boss level in my first two hours of play time because I just happened to get the right drops on the right class with the right weapon. It's basically the only way you can win. Skill won't get you there. ""choices"" won't really get you there either. You can't make a good build from things that drop by changing your strategy - it's just not a thing in this game. 

You have to RNG the right weapons, the right level perks w/the right gadgets. If you don't, you won't get very far. When you do, you'll get to the boss and you'll get snagged in multiple ridiculous hacks (that take control of you) or ""stunned"" over and over again. Instead of the enemies being ""harder,"" they just throw cheesy ""difficulty"" tactics at you and ""yay you"" if you happen to have a build that will overcome it. 

Skill isn't the winner or loser in this game - RNG is. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the game. But, they really need to fix this stuff. I shouldn't rely on certain weapons with every playthrough. But, that's the way it is.",1701179030,1701179305,False,7,0,0.492777645587921143,0,True,False,False

Honestly, enemy shots (regular, not bosses, bosses are ok) that take up half your screen and are almost impossible to dodge sometimes (and they do ton of damage) do get annoying. Secondly - recovery orbs do not stay long enough, so the game promotes aggressive gameplay, making you jump into danger more and more to recover health as you fight, and considering the first problem, that isnt always fun.

This game has a ton of depth, an incredibly satisfying combat system, and a lot of replayability. There are 6 characters in the game as of this review, and each one has its own upgrades that noticeably change the way you play the game. 

For example, Guardian, the starter class, has 2 abilities: Bastion and Bash. Bastion is a bubble shield on yourself that lasts for 3 seconds, making you immune to all damage. Bash is a melee attack. Right off the bat, these two abilities synergize well, since bastion protects you while you use bash in the enemies' faces. You can also use the shield as a panic button for when you mess up and need the invulnerability. Just two upgrades can change these from a defensive option and low health enemy control, into a DPS machine. One upgrade changes bash to bonk, where you get a hammer. The second upgrade, flex handle, increases your swing speed by 50% when you use bastion. Now, instead of being second rate damage compared to your guns, you can throw on bastion and go rip and tear through everything for those 3 seconds. Want more duration on bastion? There's an upgrade for that. Want more armor to tank hits better? There's an upgrade for that. Hell, you could forgo that damage build entirely, and instead spec into using bash as a support tool. Linebreaker increases your guns' damage by a whopping 50% after hitting bash.

I could go on for every other class if I had the time, and if you had the patience. This game absolutely provides the feeling of POWER that makes rogue-likes work. The art style is also very nice. It's good in multiplayer too.

All the classes have the same role of dealing damage, (except elementalist, who is currently OP as hell) but the developers have really outdone themselves giving each one its own flavor. It never feels stale to switch between characters, because they all play so differently.

9.5/10 game, my only complaint is the lack of sound cues for enemies about to shoot you. It can get pretty hard to tell what's going on in later levels. That's probably just a skill issue on my end, though.",1701128528,1701128528,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ The guns are super nice, lots of variation, playstyles, upgrades. This is what makes the game fun, every run is different because you can create the build that you want.
+ There are no ammo pickups, instead you swap to your secondary weapon and your ammo regenerates automatically. It's genius for this type of game as it keeps the action going and makes you want to use both guns.
+ Characters have some unique abilities and their own upgrades to further diversify your playstyle.
+ Plenty of bosses, elites, different routes.
+ Love the cartoony art style.
+ Map design is nice, the difference between floors keeps gameplay fresh. Enemies are all on the same level but there is some verticality and jump pads for tactical advantage.
+ They included the Flak Cannon from Unreal Tournament! <3

So, it's a roguelite FPS that plays pretty good, feels smooth and has some challenge (too much at some places imo) to it. But there's a couple of things that could've been a lot better.

The first is a roguelite aspect. Like, it's there, it's decent, but it's a bit shallow. What I mean is that you don't get any new guns and while in the beginning it feels nice to get new guns every time, you quickly realize that you've seen all of them and won't unlock anything new (unlike something like Gunfire Reborn).

The second is plot. It is there, but it's not really coherent. It's like devs wanted to do a decent story, but for some reason decided not to flesh it out in the end.

Other than those 2 things the game's pretty much perfect and I'd give it like 8\10, but no patches or dev blogs for like 3 weeks is kind of concerning.",1701115989,1701115989,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game I have liked 3 of the 5 characters (I only have 4 unlocked). Being able to upgrade your abilities and not just your weapons make picking your character mean that much more. Weapons are a little weird as I personally feel there are really only a few I think are good but they are all viable. Once you pick an ability upgrade you will then get upgrades for that ability and you can just make that 1 ability crazy good or upgrade all your abilities or just your character.
There are 2 in game currencies. Powercells are used during your run to unlock abilities or buy/upgrade guns. The second are wrenches which are used in your camp to upgrade vendors and their options they have or add the possibility for them to pop up more, basically making your runs have the possibility for more or stronger upgrades.

TLDR:
Good character selection
Ability upgrades are fun/unique and open the possibility of crazy builds

guns are unique and the visual designs varied and cool. i think with coming patches balance will improve as some weapons are more viable than others; personally i would buff the slower firing weapons or introduce more perks that they would benefit from (also the revolver should auto-bounce on crit bc why not). i love the art of the world and especially the guns. hopefully updates bring more as i think this team has a lot of creativity with both the art and mechanics.

It has some of the crispiest gunplay and movement you can find in a roguelite, but it feels terrible to actually play the game as a roguelite. Let me explain.

Many of the upgrades you can receive for each different class mid-run are incredibly shallow and basic. 
""Increase fire-rate by 15%""
""Increase *insert primary ability/secondary ability here* damage by 20%""
""Increase Elemental damage by 10%""
""Increase critical damage by 10%""

Some of them are more class-centric and allow you to do things like spawn an extra drone, gain reload and movement speed after your teleport, or gain an extra charge on your missile ability, but you never really feel the impact of them beyond niche situations. You also have no options to banish or remove certain upgrades, and it takes ages to unlock the base camp upgrades that give you a pitiful amount of reroll tokens (2). If you want more, you need to get them from passive items you pick up during the run. 

The actual meta-progression is laughably bad, as it's just increasing the likelihood that you'll have access to a shop or weapon ""upgrade"" station during certain points in your run. I sure do love grinding meta currency for hours just to buy an upgrade that only affects the CHANCE to spawn a shop. 

You also have upgrades that increase the rarity of the weapons that come out of chests during those same sections that the shops have a chance to spawn in, but they seemingly do fuck all because you'll have a maxed out base camp (the name for the main hub area where you purchase upgrades and select a class) and still have half of your initial starting weapon choices be the lowest possible tier. 

The rarity of the weapons is indicative of how many ""affixes"" the weapon has rolled on it, so a white weapon has no affixes, while each higher rarity gains an extra affix. Unfortunately, these affixes are just as boring as the level-up upgrades with such gripping options as:
""15% chance to shoot twice""
""20% more crit chance""
""Deals *insert elemental type here* damage""
""15% increased magazine size""
""25% chance for a bigger explosion""
and more!

Enemies will shit out guns of varying rarities, though even with the upgrade to increase the rarity drop it's VERY often just greens and blues, so you'll never find yourself getting excited. A majority of the time you just fly past it because there's almost nothing it could have rolled to make it worth swapping out for. 

The stages are all incredibly similar in layout and design until you get to some of the final levels, and you'll probably find yourself forgetting where you are if you don't pay close attention. The actual aesthetic of the game is great, but it doesn't feel like the art design for the stages ever really went beyond its initial stage. 

A lot of the moment-to-moment combat ends up feeling repetitive and same-y between runs, as even changing classes just doesn't do enough to help distinguish the actual gameplay from the others. It's not that there aren't any differences, as I would be lying if I said that. It's just that the differences aren't pronounced enough to really make it feel like you're playing a whole new class. Your approach to combat isn't likely to change much even when you're using different weapons and classes. 

Ultimately, I want to recommend Roboquest, but I just can't at the moment. You have better options for movement shooters. You have better options for roguelites. You have better options for co-op. It's the kind of game I find myself leaving play sessions feeling frustrated rather than happy. Roboquest is a game that I feel like I WANT to enjoy, but I can't seem to find that same spark and excitement that I get from similar titles. 

I never get the feeling of a god run, nor do I get the feeling that I'm getting shafted by RNG because everything you acquire during a run is so surface level in its functionality and presentation. It feels like a lot of the mechanics that are meant to encourage replayability and potential for unique and different runs just don't do enough or even exist at all.",1700929738,1700951589,False,71,4,0.686446309089660645,4,True,False,False

With nearly 30 hours into the game, I have had an extremely good time and yet there's still more to do.

Now, Roboquest promises to deliver a lot of things, such as fast-paced movement, various builds (whether its weapons or upgrades), several classes, persistent upgrades (roguelite elements) and so much more.
[list]
[*][b]Fast-paced movement[/b] is something Roboquest delivers extremely well on, with several launch pads in every level, as well as [i]powerful[/i] launch pads in more predetermined spots. This alone already lets you build up quite a lot of movement speed, before you factor in upgrades that increase your movement speed, rocket-jumping, as well as other upgrades and buffs that I'll keep a mystery for you to figure out!

[*][b]Various builds[/b] are part of the core gameplay loop in Roboquest and alongside upgrades it makes every run feel different. The upgrade system works great too, it features both perks and upgrades, where you first pick a perk and then unlock upgrades for said perk or you can also just pick from perks that are generally available. As for weapons you have affixes that go between several rarities, as well as the chance of having an alternative fire with some examples being a rocket-jump, a barrier or a marking shot.

[*][b]Several classes[/b] are another major core piece of Roboquest and there's a different preference and playstyle to each class, although when starting you will most likely only have Guardian, but unlocking a few others should be an easy task. Instead of describing any of them, I'd recommend you to give each class a few tries, with different builds/perks and see how it feels, as one perk was part of what made me start to enjoy Commando a lot more and then I loosely built my preferences around that. 

[*][b]Persistent upgrades[/b] is the roguelite element in Roboquest and it mostly exists within your basecamp, where you have several tiers of permanent upgrades that unlocks the next tier after you've bought enough upgrades. You also have gadgets which will make a huge difference, both in terms of gameplay, as well as your sustainability, as these are unlocked progressively. Think of them as side-quests, some are unlocked through simple brief tasks, while others take a few runs to complete, but once you unlock them they will automatically be equipped (in the run, not after the run).
[/list]
Roboquest still has so much more to offer though - for example the co-op, but I have yet to try it so I can't speak on whether it's good or not unfortunately. One thing I can speak on however, is the soundtrack and out of everything in this whole game, despite how great it is, I have to admit that I still can't get enough of the soundtrack. It's the one, but also the [b]only[/b], time I went ahead and bought the soundtrack too, and they knocked it out of the park.

With all that being said, it's such a solid game that regardless of what you're looking for, I can almost guarantee you that as long as you enjoy a fast-paced roguelite shooter, Roboquest delivers and gives you such a great time, but also kicks your ass simultaneously.",1700914508,1700914736,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Gameplay wise, all the classes feel great. Theres a lot of different perks to grab at random with their own subupgrades to pick from, so you have a lot of replayability even on the same class.

This game appears to draw a little inspiration from games like Risk of Rain, as you can spend currency to unlock items that boost the current run, albeit with said items being more powerful than in ROR since they do not stack.

The guns are pretty fun. Good mixture for anything your into, whether it's generic SMG or Assault rifles, massive explosive launchers, bows, snipers, whatever. Little bit of melee too as a treat.

Plenty of collectibles. Force yourself to use a specific gun to master it, small chances of dropping enemy info cards from enemies, force yourself to use a different build to unlock data regarding it.
You can show your friends. They will be amazed.

You get rebuilt if you get destroyed. There isn't any death in the game.

It's also important to note the slightly standard patterns of the maps are for good reason: The game has a huge focus on exploration and secrets. While it doesn't seem like it at first, there is actually a lot past the surface, and I personally found the experience of exploration to be very pleasing. 

There is a story, mostly found on secrets, but it's not the focus and isn't very memorable. 

Boss fights are something I value a lot and I believe most of them are very fun to fight. Sometimes I feel I got overtuned on later stages and thus made the bosses a bit too easy, but they are still very well designed and, should you be unlucky or play on a higher difficulty, you'll quickly notice how they are a true test of skill in using your arsenal on most cases. 

Because the ""rogue"" elements of the game are mostly tied to meta progression, it can get stale for some, but I personally enjoyed it so much that I went out of my way to do as many optional challenges, collecting and achievements as possible. The soundtrack is superb and playing the multiplayer feels nice and with a proper dose of challenge, it's not one of those games where multiplayer makes the gameplay trivial.

Do you keep searching for games which can remind you of the good old Doom game or FPS in general?
Do you want to feel cool like the new kids who play Call of Duty or Fortnite?
Wanna see the action from John Wick's perspective? 

Then this game is just for you my friend. 

Roboquest is a game where you can feel like John Wick, explore like Lara Croft and keep trying like Rocky Balboa.
It shows you the old school + new school style of FPS games, which is ""Run and Shoot"".
Roboquest has different difficulties, but if you are veteran fps gamer or just trying to make your game challenging, then there is only one difficulty for you my friend ( Which is also recommended from the game itself) and that is ""Hard"" difficulty. 
Just like the game""Hades"", you have hard start, learning the basic stuff, learning the weapons and learning the zones.
However, the more you play, the easier it can become for you, as you keep getting yourself upgrades.

""I still find this game hard though"". Well sir, then i recommend you the"" 2 players Co-Op"" option. That's right - you can play with a friend, so you can reach the game's end.
Either playing alone or with a friend,  you will find that this game can be very satisfying for the challenges that it brings.

The soundtrack is amazing and the multiple paths/classes encourage exploration and replayability. My only real gripe is that they do that thing where you are rewarded for exploring, but you are also rewarded for going fast. It feels like you either have to dedicate a run to speedrunning OR exploring, not both.
This comes down to taste, but I also feel like unlocks matter A LOT, not just for flavor but for getting further in runs. The permanent upgrade tree is very important and while I guess it's POSSIBLE to blaze through the game on your first run, this isn't a game where skillful play is all you need. A lot of handy gadgets are locked away behind mini quests which I find fun and engaging, but it also means that you aren't free to express yourself fully as a player until at least 10 or so runs in - most quests take many runs to complete.

With that said, the game has one of the most potent ""just one more run"" feelings I've come across lately, the soundtrack contains exactly 0 duds and the gameplay is smooth as anything.",1700765370,1700765370,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

9/10
Very fun game!
Huge props to the devs.

[The good]
-  Gameplay is fun and engaging.
-  Music is awesome.
-  Great updates over time of development taking into amount community feedback -and addressing the 
areas that need some work effectively.
-  Fun and simple progression system that encourages multiple runs using different routes.
-  Good level of mechanical depth for building and upgrading during runs while not becoming too 
complicated.
-  The levels look and feel vibrant, which is supported with a bit of lighthearted comedy.
-  story is acceptable. It's nothing special, but it does add a lot of life to the world and characters.

[The could improve]
-   A thing I miss a little bit is a victory run option. To be able to keep restarting with all the upgrades intact [without it helping with game progression]. I often end a run wishing I had 1 or 2 more levels. Not because the game is too easy, but because I am so close to a fun and ridiculous build I just want to try out.

-   The city maps can get a little confusing. Perhaps a marker on the mini-map showing spawn or the end goal [once found] would help me better understand my location

-   Basecamp seems to develop over time, but I don't know what tigers it or if there is any left to upgrade. [Maybe I just could not find the UI for it]

[The bad ish]
First view runs with the v1.0 reset were a little annoying as so many features essential to the game like vendors were locked behind upgrades, this made we want to rush through the start rather than take time to enjoy some initial runs.

[Summary]
As a game designer myself, I can see that every feature was put in with a clear goal and purpose which encourages variety while not enforcing it, allowing you to truly just play the game how you want.
This is the type of game you keep coming back too even when finished because of the smooth CCC and replayable nature of the mechanics.",1700743909,1700743909,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've seen many cases of this now and here's what happens. 
Most of the content, creativity, thinking, weaponry, time, money, everything that goes into ""games like these"" just shouldn't be in the game to start with because you have ONE FACTOR THAT RULES ALL and, ultimately, should be the only thing in your game because everyone knows you d*mn sure aren't going to take it out. Rule #1 to not being stupid, [i] You naturally get more value when you work with something that is better than what you had. [/i] Lots of developers can't see this and it's mind blowing. To think driving a car is faster than walking. Insane to think something that simple is so hard to comprehend.

This games biggest problem is movement speed increase buffs. The A.I. are clearly scripted to have their bullets and attacks be slow because of the player having set ground movement speed. There's perks you get mid-run and ""mutations"" to enable before the run that make you move faster. Also, there's a Jet-Pack class you can play that just lets you fly and a lot of A.I. can't even react correctly because you're in the air with best type of movement you can possibly have (also gains movement speed increase buffs). Out of Topic, Ark Survival Evolved has movement speeds buffs but in their ""remastered"" version they took movement speed buffs out because it ruined more than half the game.

Most of the guns are extremely trash or useless. There's roughly around 100 guns and literally 90 of them are just useless. Most of them are missing a lot of detail to make them feel like an actual gun or your level 1 weapon is ""magically"" somehow better than this level 7 weapon.

Some/most of the level design is very boring and not enjoyable. The first zone in the game is easily the most fun and best looking. The rest of the game, having it not change for over a year, is kind of disgusting. Bunch of empty, lonely areas and pretty poorly built for a game that is supposed to be designed for having ""fight areas"". You can get on top of a lot of buildings in the city and there's literally nothing up there and this is in almost (basically) every level of the game. A lot of core understanding of keeping the player busy is just not there (while the game is also giving you score for beating the level as fast as possible too [Yep. They want you to explore and beat it as fast as possible. I don't understand.]).

The most the game has for it is the movement, surprisingly. Crouch-Slide into Double Jump, shooting your gun mid-air back into Crouch-Slide, shooting your gun, repeat, is really fun and THE GAME IS BUILT FOR THAT... BUT when there's movement speed increase buffs and then you introduce ""the"" Jet-Pack class it gets rid of the whole point to play the game and the true difficulty it provides so people are unlocking end-game content by not even playing the game correctly and the hardest difficulties are developed/intended to be cheated by playing in this pathetic way because of the developers decision to put A.I. that shoot slow and the ability for the player to fly plus movement speed increase buffs together and that's the EXACT REASON why you shouldn't play it. It was heavily advertised so that's why it has more sales than it should have. Games that have flawed concepts should be free. It's not worth $1.",1612660877,1700730636,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

There is co-op in the game although it is only 2 player co-op, but it works well and each player gets their own loot. 

My only negative so far, is the map generation isn't too deep, so most runs do tend to run together a bit, though the gun variety still keeps it feeling different enough each time.

It probably does have around 20-30 Hours of content depending how well you play and how fast you unlock stuff.

The movement is very good in this game: crouch slide, jump, repeat,over and over just feels so good. Its very fun and there is enough guns to make it varied, especially after some meta progression to give them cool prefixes. Good artstyle and runs good.
Could maybe use one or 2 stage 1/2 bosses but they feel varied and well implemented.
just overall a very good game

Some minor things i dont like:
-you need a guide for the secret stuff, check the official roboquest discord it has one for all of the things, but its not very intuitive to find things and i would have not found 50% of the secrets without the internet.
-you sometimes have to take a bad upgrade to get cool and good upgrades later. Its kinda unintuitive and should probably just tell you that that upgrade unlocks more in the upgrade tree because for a while i missed out on cool things because i tool the obvious choice over ""10% more melee damage""
-Some scrolls or whatever they are called need a bit of balance,  stuff like ""15% more damage but will stun you and get you killed"" is honestly just not worth in any scenario, even with the stun reduction.

But still a very good game that i can recommend and those are just minor nitpicks that i hope the devs fix.

Also make sure to EXIT out of the game normally, dont alt f4! the game saves your progress when you close, meaning should you crash or alt f4 you will lose this sessions progress.",1700701882,1700702039,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ignoring how awesome this game is, I would recommend it just by virtue of their dev team being great and constantly looking out for the community. I'm leaving this review after they made an update following the 1.0 release.

Their 1.0 release completely reset your progress. You lose everything, and it wasn't optional. This was very frustrating to have to grind through all of the meta-progression again. I play this with my wife, and we both started to get away from playing the game because we felt robbed. We left feedback via the in-game option stating our disappointment with the direction the game took. Turns out the change to revert all your progress was received very poorly. It's barely been a week, and RyseUp released an update and apology for forcing it. It seems small, but it was a frustration shared by many. Knowing RyseUp listens to feedback is more than enough to get me to publish a positive review. As a customer, I feel respected and listened-to.

There are so many ""????"" moments in this game when you see an area you have no idea what it does or how to access it.  The game doesn't give you a lot of hints on how to do really anything but relies on your die hard FPS experience to get you there.  Investigating the verticality of areas to find hidden data logs was something I didn't expect to do but the desire to unlock additional areas keeps me starting up another round.  I like the fast-paced flow of the combat and the music makes everything feel awesome.  The anime-style onomatopoeia text for all the gun sounds is such a nifty little touch and adds to the overall fun of the FPS gameplay.  Highly recommend to those looking for a different FPS rougelike

The good: The music, the FPS gunplay, the exploration and secrets, interesting boss fights, and cool style
The meh: Punishing early progression, game doesn't tell you about a lot of the stuff you need to be looking for, some of the guns are absolutely useless (Looking at you Thumper, Kunai, comet cannon, etc...).

Regardless of that, this sits right up there in some of the most legendary games in my top 10 list, up there with Borderlands 2 for example... simply from it's style both in gameplay and just graphically, it's not by any means some intense graphically demanding game, it just runs and looks immaculately smooth and that comic book style is incredibly desirable. 
The story isn't pushy or drawn out, it's simply animated and just all round perfect for the first time playthrough, that lets you then get on with future runs now that you've seen it.

The weapons are pretty well designed, even though they might not be mechanically viable, here's to you Splasher Rifle, but I found myself clicking with the Bandito Gun specifically and seeking that in most of my runs.

Each class is viable, each gun is viable, RNG doesn't jab you too much, and the beat keeps you coming back with each run. I keep finding myself coming back to this game over and over again because it's addictingly fun to take on bots with different combinations of guns changing up the strategy each time, swapping my route each time. The bosses make for a good speed bump on speed runs.

Having now played most of what Roboquest's full has to offer, beating the game twice and so on, I can say with full confidence that this is a game definitely worth looking at. The fun comic book artstyle, the excellent ""gunfeel"" and gameplay, the masterpiece of a soundtrack, it's all there. 

The game's really replayable with tons of stuff to collect such as weapon, enemy, and story logs, unlockables including crystals, classes, and the entire upgrade tree of the basecamp. 

In addition to unlocks and collectibles there are so many different perk builds to try with each of the classes. Want endless explosions on the commando, or would you rather play into the fury mechanics? Want your elementalist to throw all sorts of elemental attacks constantly, or focus on only one element and make it broken?

It's just so good. Even in its current early access form, every update provides me with hours of new content.

5 different classes (and counting!) with vastly different abilities that each come with a unique set of perks that allow you to create even more unique builds that focus on different things!
Weapon variety is huge and increasing in every major update, all are fun to use and perks change these up AGAIN.

A bumpin soundtrack by Noisecream and a really well put together art direction that can be a bit cluttered at times. 

Some weapons don't feel useful in many of the more difficult scenarios, such as the locked arena rooms.  The long range weapons being sub par since most of the game takes place at speed and close range is unfortunate since they do well elsewhere, but aren't as versatile.

Some of the upgrades are unique enough to me but it won't hurt to have more creativity would it? 
Other than that, the weapons feels good and each of them have interesting playstyle which will also change accordingly with their perks.  
The movement is also very fluid which I think makes up for the gameplay variety.

  so for the people who touch grass here is my review:

Movement:  
 the game has great movement simple at first but as you play the game it begins to become more complex basically growing with you as you play the game. it goes from jump, slide, and run. to slide jumping, and rocket jumping. to a jet pack, a triple jump, and grapple hook... the first two sets are learnable no upgrades required to pull them off just learn the mechanics. the last set are upgrades you can get in a variety of fun ways (i will not say how as you really should find that out yourself by playing the game)

Guns:
  the gun play is also fantastic, it's a quick and twitchy mess in all the best ways possible. the guns range from shotguns to sniper rifles to a shovel and god damn laser guns! that's not even half the list... need less to say if you like a certain type of weapon it's in the game somewhere, and all the weapons in the game feel unique giving the game a lot of replay-ability.

Classes/Builds
  the classes are awesome as well with each of the six having entirely different play-styles, as well as each having different ways to play each class. this combined with the guns, and the item upgrades, and the level up perks leads to a massive array of ways to play the game. aggressive, defensive, long range, close range, you name it it's possible. the only constant is movement, you have to be on the move constantly or you will die. 

 Other stuff:
   that's not even mentioning the music or the art style of the game which are both just as premium as the game itself. the only issue i have with the game is that it's not longer i would love more areas to go to, but that could come as a DLC or a free update you never know. honestly though i would be fine even if that never came to pass. i mean i have put in about 30 or 40 hours when the game released not to mention the 60+ hours in early access. i got my moneys worth and then some!

First thing that struck me was the music, it's easily a 9/10 when it comes to game OSTs and I'm obsessed.
It's really easy to pick up and put down and almost any time.
There are some obvious notes taken from Gunfire Reborn, but in my opinion it executes almost all of them better (minus character diversity, it could be expanded later for sure.)
The guns are a blast and all feel very unique but still strangely viable. 
The art style and cutscenes are phenomenal but I understand if the art style isn't your cup of tea. The game is still VERY enjoyable even if you skip them all. 
There are a ton of secrets to find, hidden rooms, hidden NPC's, weird quirks and just fun activities that you can make as mini-goals during your runs.
The Co-op while only 2 player (I wish it was 4) is seamless and works incredibly well. 
You can't just instantly carry a friend to places they don't have access to, but you can guide them on getting they keys/unlockables to get there.

Then, 1.0 released. 1.0 is the perfect distillation of everything that made the game great in early access. The movement is fast and frantic, the guns all feel excellent (even if they do not appear to be so on first blush), the playable character variety is amazing (in EA i would play pretty much just Commando cuz you know, rocket) and each one has their own individual playstyle and upgrade trees. I haven't even mentioned how some gadgets completely change the way you play. 
The more you are willing to explore the map, the more you are rewarded, both in terms of collectibles [initially] and upgrades. 

Overall, quite frankly, it's like the devs were reading my mind with this game. My criteria nowadays for whether or not I will play your game is if I can sprint into a slide and jump. In this game, I don't even have to sprint to slide. Movement is hugely important to me in video games, and on the basis of how good the movement in this game is alone I wholeheartedly recommend (ESPECIALLY if I include the gadgets). There are so many weapons that there are some I don't see for multiple runs at a time, and I kinda really like that; I'm the type to do the same thing over and over again because I like how it feels, so being forced out of my comfort zone into using something new is always fun.

The game is hard, but it rewards accuracy and moving around like a madman.

The things it does well :
- Movements are smooth and you have a lot of tools to move around
- No ""you one hit enemies and they one hit you"" bullsh*t
- A horde game with bullet hell elements where the ennemies slowly drain your health instead of killing you in one hit
- A LOT of weapons and almost all of them are good. On top of that, you are encouraged to swap weapons often
- No ammo reserve, you can reload as often as you want
- POCKET RELOAD (you have 2 weapon slots and the weapon you aren't using is slowly reloading itself)
- No dumb experience orbs to collect around
- You are punished for not paying attention to the enemies or for not dealing with certain enemies in priority
- Lots of funny builds to play with

The bad stuff :
- The meta upgrades are a bit too strong, or rather, it feels like they nerfed a lot of things just so you can unlock meta upgrades to boost these things back to normal. 
- Some levels are unique, but some of them really feel identical.

The difficulty settings are good and bad at the same time :
Enemies get more health and deal more damage, but they're also more aggressive and some of them are replaced with more advanced enemies.

No comment on the story, I'm just not playing for the story.

To the people comparing this game with gunfire reborn, just stop.
Gunfire reborn isn't a fast fps, and it relies a lot more on finding good combinations of abilities, scrolls and affixes than it relies on raw skill.

Its outstanding visual style, fantastic soundtrack, robust movement system and slew of interesting weapons and skill to cause carnage are all things that make it stand out from the crowd.

Its not the best FPS roguelike out there at the moment. Right now that award goes to Gunfire, but its a close thing. Both are similar experiences, but they come to the action from different ends. For the most part Gunfire encourages cautious play where every minor wound can stack to leave you near deaths door. Roboquest however encourages and in fact revels in a reckless rush to the finish of a level, swapping weapons frequently and taking hits knowing healing comes from every defeated enemy.

[b]A loot-shooter with roguelike elements, emphasizing precise movement.[/b] The lowered crosshair is simply overpowered; the developers brilliantly and simply solved the problem with flying enemies – applause! The weapons are interesting: with projectiles, beams, additional attacks, throwable, melee; abilities, elemental damage – all of this provides limitless potential for replays. The developers also went the extra mile and added small secrets where you're allowed to ""step out"" of the map, find journals, or discover hidden levels.

Lot of build variety. You can go elemental, crit, melee, etc. Wish there was more defense/support options though as health is a rarity in this game and some rooms are a bullet hell. Maybe just a damage cooldown, like once you take damage you can be damaged for 0.5 seconds. Just enough to prevent insta-death.

Huge variety of guns, perks, and level ups that make every run different. Various paths that make every run feel a bit different but gives you full control of where you go. Interesting boss fights too.

now if you are looking forward to the whole game and all steam achievements i cannot recommend.
starting with the difficulties easy is where is most of the fun is, being able to do what you want, there is such a massive gap between easy and standard that hard doesnt even feel different than standard, everything above hard just increases enemy hp and damage feeling very frustrating and not enjoyable, much more when you consider the time limit for rank and enemies becoming bullet sponges.

the game feels fast but when you have to dodge the most shots as possible you will realize you have the mobility of a cannonball, fast but heavy and not really meant to dodge, the weight just makes it slow to change direction feeling uncomfortable.

rogues get replayability from experimenting with builds but we dont have it here, there is some stuff that make a noticeable difference but it never feels consistent, never feels the same, the same weapon that just easily cleared the room could struggle in the next run, sometimes even in the next room.
i should be able to know what makes it better or worse after S ranking the highest difficulty but i dont have the slightest clue, between bot level, bot upgrades, items, weapon level, weapon rarity, weapon affix there are too many little things making the run inconsistent and not really have a build you can think and want to make, just hoping the enemy dies when you shoot them before something shoots you outside your view.",1700504659,1700504659,False,7,0,0.482790976762771606,0,True,False,False

As a returning player its a bit of a chore to reopen base upgrades, but i guess with 1.0 wipe had to happen.

Few minor cons. Very light on passive items, most of your power comes from guns you find and passives you select upon level up. There are also sort of artifacts to be found, but thet are few and give mostly utility effects. I wish there more of those and powers were better.

The GURL... They've changed her model from the beta, it looks very slightly better, but still like an alien (Dead eyes, enormous forehead, plastic hair). Ask someone who knows how to make cute characters in 3D (2D art is good) for help, i dunno.

Honestly 10/10. The only thing that would change my opinion would be if the devs did not give it a proper post release.

after multiple playthroughs, one almost an entire run with just the shovel and buddy bot surprisingly making it pretty far on normal, there still is alot of charm, the unlocks over time do get better, though i feel the skill tree feels like you dont unlock as much as youd think a whole tree slot would. the classes feel abit better balanced than before, and some of the old op weapons def feel more balanced now. there is some fun paths to unlock, especially using certain items to unlock extra areas. some weapons def feel out of place slightly still, but you can just ignore them most times.

i still really really hate the hack bot enemies, please remove them or nerf them.


old negative 1.0 review:
full release is pretty disappointing in places, it had alot of promise, and charm, and the devs seemed to actively listen to their fans, but with this idk man, like as a game its ok, the mechanics are fine enough, but it just doesn't mix well with how they changed the rouge-like elements. the really awful enemies that make you press inputs to escape are still the worst enemy ive ever seen for a game where your long run can be ended in a few hits. that thing needs to be dumped in the trash. the music can either be a bop, or its super grading, the first few areas i have my headset  on full to get pumped to it, mission 3 i think it is i mute the game cause the track sucks, its just loud repetitive noise trying to be ""we got roller mobster at home"".
guns feel overall weaker, animations feels mismatched as some have a floaty borderlands janky feel (which i think is perfectly fine) and then others have this weighty mw19 almost attempt to them (which mind you, i also think is fine), and you can tell what guns were added when. they just dont feel like they belong together though. builds being changed around and class items getting changed/scrapped is abit rough, havent really enjoyed what has been done, granted some things i do like.
the hub feels super last minute slapped together, i think there were some EA versions i liked better. its not even like the place builds with you anymore (at least that i noticed)
theres some stinky frame rate issues in the final area that bumped me from a super solid 60, down to 40 for no reason, unless you animated the entire planet, then ive no idea why its so tanky there.






old early access review:

I really enjoy this game, its been a treat seeing it evolve over time,  the game play is pretty solid
A mix of roguelike mixed with borderlands 2 is a good combination.
I can go on for days about praising it, but I feel pointing out some flaws is important too.
-frame rates randomly dip hard, especially in the 3rd zone, the option to turn off ragdolls doesnt effect the environmental dressing either so itll just chug. The water zones boss absolutely will destroy your frame rates for no reason.
-currently runs only take like an hour to complete, with some locations locked off in ""under construction "", which is fine as its early access, but in case anyone is expecting a longer game",1645546839,1700455067,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The museum/card system gives you a reason to try out the various weapons and items, the shooting feels good, most weapons are unique and fun to play with, enemies have enough variety in attacks to keep me engaged in dodging etc. I'm just someone who tends to focus a lot on the negatives, and in this game the negatives mainly pertain to the ""roguelite"" element. As a PvE FPS, it is still very good.

The negatives (in my eyes) are:
1) Co-op has some bugs - most common one is occasionally an enemy will not display its HP to the non-host player, and the final boss sometimes glitches and is stuck in the ground during Phase 2, only to suddenly pop-up mid animation when it attacks. This also means that there's an attack it can do (the one where it spins 3 lasers rapidly around the arena) that lasts a long time but during which the non-host player cannot damage it, as it sinks under the map on their screen.

2) Endgame is distinctly lacking. If I hadn't committed to collecting all achievements (specifically the one for beating Guardian 4 w/ S rank) I would have no reason to play after beating Guardian 1. Wrenches in particular are pointless after buying out the workshop, and the one place to spend them post-workshop only requires 30 per run if you even want the achievement for clearing the Museum, which is easily obtained if playing on Hard or higher.

3) A lot of items are bad. I ignore the majority at this point and only look for certain ones. A few have seemingly unnecessary downsides that make me never want to use them as the positive is far outweighed by the negative, even if it's chance-based. Also, despite the game only giving you maybe 12 or so items per run, each item's effect is generally so miniscule that I barely notice it. More often than not, I only remember I have certain items on when the downside hits, like reducing my fire rate w/ a junk beam equipped makes it spam noise as if I'm clicking repeatedly instead of holding it down, or suddenly getting frozen because of a chance based downside.",1700415496,1700415496,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It strikes a unique balance between relying on good gunplay, engaging upgrading, and interesting metaprogression that make each run unique. Even after beating the game on the hardest difficulty on all characters I still find new viable and exciting builds every run. Additionally, the game is FULL of secrets, new paths to take, and new items/characters to discover. Expect each run to affect the next as you unlock new paths and get hints at things you might have passed earlier on each attempt. I really can't stress enough how there really is something hidden no matter where you turn. The comic book art style is also really cool-it is clear the team chose an idea and stuck with it, and it works perfectly. The movement is great, the guns feel awesome, and runs always feel fresh. I've watched this game grow since the first open beta, and I'm super happy with how it turned out.

I have a few complaints particularly with the amount of content. There's decent weapon variety but most of them fall into the same 5 or so archetypes and feel very samey. The game could use more areas and bosses which will hopefully come in future updates or DLC. I unlocked and beat the highest difficulty with full S-rank within roughly 20 in-game hours so I would like to see higher ascending difficulties personally.

The main loop will see you taking punishing damage from waves upon waves of bullets as everything fires all the time and the hp orbs drop directly below the enemy you killed, last for like 5 seconds, and then dissappear, which would make you think you need to play close-range constantly, but that's how you take even more damage, so, I don't know. This was a problem in early access too and clearly did not get resolved in 1.0. At least XP orbs that function the same way don't exist anymore, but the extra powercores do, so, get ready to feel like you're always playing wrong even though you're not.

You now HAVE to grind wrenches pretty hard, as an entire 1.0 hour-and-a-half run will only net you 55 wrenches (2 upgrade's worth) and everything ""run"" (the rougelike bits) is locked in said grind... which is not fun to do when everything is now a twitchy, dodging bullet sponge that shoots aoes at you in constant swarms. It used to not be like that, but I guess the dev was displeased by people enjoying the game and running it on Heroes +2 for fun before the elite update happened and now we're all suffering for it... for some reason.

Gadgets got absolutely hemmoraged horribly for 1.0 . They're now locked behind random quests, and those quests are hidden away or are just obnoxious, with pieces placed behind other pieces, doors, and requirements, and I just wish they were all set back to being one-time-purchased, really. You'll probably be stuck with 3 or 4 gadgets that do nothing for your playstyle and wonder where the other 6 are.

The... I guess I'll call them Roguelike Pickups as they don't have a specific name, they're the upgrade chips with images of random, unrelated items on them, are now pretty bland or dumb as opposed to interesting or useful, AND if you don't have all the meta, they're a powercell sink that's not a good idea to invest in.

Weapons got weird names that no longer tell you what they are, so a lot of the time you'll probably pick up guns you don't need just to find out what they are and how they work, but not use them because they feel weak, hit nothing, don't have fast enough projectiles, or just don't fit your style of play, which is a shame when there's so many weapons, but with the aforementioned twitchy bullet hell of the enemies in 1.0.... Yyyeah there was gonna be no other fate for a lot of the weapons due to that.

The same could be said of a lot of the perks that made it to 1.0, they're just kinda... Obsolete or required. Obsolete ones do pretty much nothing or are gimmicky (hitting bots with melee for more orbs even though doing that will get you hit for more damage, weapon gets a random element every 4 seconds, which can actually hurt your dps with the resistant enemies, and does not boost elemental damage), and necessary ones are your usual, generic, damage up, fire rate up, reload up, etc.

Classes are... No. Just play Guardian, the game's a bullet hell now and you'll wish you were playing them for the invuln bubble so you can actually live longer and do more damage, which is funny if you were here for Early Access, where it was fun and technically better to play anyone BUT Guardian.

The final area and boss are just a headache. The concept of the crystals would be neat if they weren't tucked away in random areas with random challenges that are the worst things in the game, that also add the worst enemies to normal runs for... Not that much benefit, honestly. All they do is augment the final two arenas and, if I remember right, a tiny portion of one phase of IRIS's health, while she has 2 phases that are full bullet hells that I absolutely loathe. Judge Ball was bad enough, but then the devs took their concept, replaced some attacks, then said ""yay final boss done!"" ... Is it any wonder that it's the worst part of the game when preceeded by two horrid arenas...

In the end, I'm just dissappointed. It WAS fine, but the chaotic nature of these devs seems to have won out for 1.0, lots of the changes from EA just before elites were added to Elites being added to 1.0 just made the game worse, not better. 2/10.",1623200851,1700363404,False,0,0,0.358727544546127319,0,True,False,True

First of all, it's really nicely balanced, several characters, none feel bad (even the ""standard"" one, which is in most game the generic character with nothing special), same for weapons. There is some thing that feel stronger, but everything can work at the highest difficulty

Also, you can go soooo fast, and it's easy to learn, thanks to rocket jumping. The trailer is really ""slow"" from what you can actualy do in-game, but you don't have to, playing more casualy works too. That's why I said perfect, all gamestyle can be done, and be strong. More APM = more efficient, but no APM don't make you feel useless.

Content wise, the levels are really cool, all the secrets are really fun to find, and you can decide which road to take, so it's really up to you if you want a faster run with less xp or a longer one that will make you more ready to the final boss.

The best thing about Roboquest is its pure FPS gameplay. It's brutally simple but fun- Passive pocket reloading is very powerful to encourage constant weapon swaps, all enemies drop healing orbs so you're encouraged to get up close, headstomping enemies deals big damage and lets you carry on fluid momentum, and a ranking system that encourages you to clear out levels quickly, and it all feels gorgeous. As a plus, I also really like the presentation, the PG-rated Borderlands schtick actually becomes very endearing and I love Noisecream's work on the OST.

So, if you want a great FPS action game, you don't need to read the rest of this review, just buy this game, it's a hidden gem. If you're a roguelite fan, you will probably buy this game anyway, but you would benefit from reading the rest of this review.


I do think Roboquest is dragged down [b]slightly[/b] by its implementation of roguelite mechanics. An extra element like it was necessary as the FPS gameplay loop was probably too simplistic to make a particularly big game out of it, but as a big fan of both FPS and roguelites/likes I will say the former itch was much better scratched by this game than the latter.


Roboquest leans towards unlocks being [b]upgrades,[/b] lots and lots of upgrades. It's not as bad as Rogue Legacy, but it does get to the point where you start to think winning won't be realistically possible until you get X or Y upgrade and begin to perform runs not on the earnest hope this will be the one, but more just to reach so and so upgrade. In particular, I feel like the [spoiler]Jetpack[/spoiler] should've been a Class specific mechanic rather than a permanent upgrade applied to everyone, as it makes other upgrades and mechanics feel redundant unless you go out of your way to turn it off.

I acknowledge that this being a negative is mostly personal preference. Roughly judging based on sales, it appears most people prefer the assurance of permanent power unlocks in roguelites to keep them motivated.

In terms of keeping runs varied, I think Roboquest does an okay, but not great job. It has different characters (Classes) which change the properties of your melee attack (sometimes to become an extra gun instead of a melee attack!) and your cooldown-limited special ability. The Classes also have several unique upgrade lines with related sub-upgrades, like how the assassin can either turn into a melee god or focus on upgrading the properties of their teleport. Tying so much of run uniqueness to Classes though does feel like it limits run variation a bit though as your runs will be mostly defined by which of these Class upgrades you pick, not much else. Unlike say, Hades, which has a similar Weapons system and their unique Hammer upgrades, but also has an extra layer with the God upgrades and their focuses mostly defining runs.

Roboquest does have alternate level routes; The first level splits off into 3 different options, those options narrow to two level variations to act as the midgame, then the game narrows to a linear set of 3 levels for endgame, with secret levels dotted around all those. However Roboquest does not have an optional superboss or etc, and this level routing mostly exists to hide secrets as opposed to strategising in your run, so I think it might get a bit stale over time.

The guns system will be hit or miss for some people. Personally, I like the weapons/affix system as it essentially serves as a soft way to encourage you to use different guns on different runs- You can invest currency into upgrading whatever gun you want, but searching for god rolls and going with whatever gun gets lucky is overall best, encouraging using different guns every run. I could however see some people being disappointed gun effects don't get quite as crazy as they perhaps could, most affixes are pretty tame.


Roboquest is absolutely worth it as is, but doesn't quite hit the ""one more run"" addiction the best kind of roguelites do.

Firstly, the classes in Roboquest feel samey in terms of how they move and how they engage enemies. Class abilities do exist, but they fail to differentiate classes to a meaningful degree. 

Secondly, the weapons in Roboquest feel samey. There are more than 70 weapons in this game. I would argue that they are just unimaginative derivatives of around 10 archetypes. The affix system does not feel impactful either. 

Thirdly, the maps in Roboquest feel…. , yes, you guessed it, samey. The “randomly generated maps” are passable at most. The bigger failure is that the biomes (ruins, energy center, etc.) do not have enough characteristics of their own. They all follow the “small corridors and big rooms” formula and the rooms are not that different. 

If you enjoy this game, great. I am glad you do. But if you are like me, I would make a recommendation: Deadlink. Deadlink is a FPS with roguelite elements. While it does not have as many weapons or “randomly generated maps” as in Roboquest, it has a surprisingly huge amount of replayability. Each class, each weapon, and each biome plays and feels differently. The degree of polishing of Deadlink is astonishing. Without knowing it, I have spent 100 hours on it and beaten it on the highest difficulty (only 1% of players achieved it). But I still want to play it more and master all the classes. With all my heart, I recommend Deadlink if you are a fan of FPS roguelite.",1699944861,1700299074,False,5,2,0.487394005060195923,0,True,False,False

Positives:
-No real performance issues. And that's nice nowadays, since I have a 1060 and find myself saying that less and less.
-Fast and fun combat. You can snipe around corners, weave through combat with melee, shoot explosives down from above(thanks to the verticality of most rooms) or stand your ground and mow down enemies with heavy weapons fire.
-Continuing from that previous point, there's a decent amount of weapon variety too, from hard hitting sniper rifles to dual wielded uzis and summonable weapons like turrets.
-Collecting and comboing perks and items together is my favorite feature in roguelites and I can say that they managed to nail that in this game. For example things like +critical chance become way more interesting when you get a perk that makes your critical hits ricochet to nearby enemies.
-Music is both great and varied. There's a calmer version of the area songs playing in the rest areas and, once you leave those to fight, the music picks up with great hyping effect. I think every area and boss has their own songs and I often found myself bopping my head to the beat.
-Looking for secrets felt fun. And no more on that since they are secrets~
-Levels are visually pleasing and feel somewhat different from each other. Also level design wise, in games like these, it's easy to place the player in a bunch of boring hallways, but the devs managed to improve on that a bit. They are still hallways, but with cover and verticality. Plus mobility increasing mechanics like grind rails and boost pads.

Negatives:
-The way the enemy projectiles look made it so that it's hard to perceive how far they are, and I often didn't notice lone bullets before they hit me. This weirdly made it so that many times I took more damage in the easy first level than in the later levels where I was dodging entire projectile swarms at a time. 
-Picking up data entries automatically opens them on top of your minimap. You can quickly close it, but that kind of thing just seems like a completely unnecessary feature in a fast paced action game like this.
-Slight balance issues. I had some trouble beating the game on hard, until I realized that stacking percentage damage perks and items makes everything melt to slag. Most of the items and perks feel useful, but some things like ""Explosions have 20% chance to have a bigger radius or 15% to have a smaller radius"" just feel genuinely useless compared to simple things like ""Increases all damage by 10% against x"". 
Also spending power cells on buying weapons felt wasteful, since you'd have to either spend more power cells to upgrade it's level or swap out to a higher level one later. Saving those cells to buy permanent upgrades instead felt way more useful.

Mehs:
-The game's not terribly long. I had all of the basecamp upgrades purchased before 15 hours. And at 20 hours I'm at the point that the only ""major"" content left is to try and beat runs faster or with higher difficulties, which don't appeal to me. There are some ""minor"" things, like getting all the collectibles or using every gun long enough to unlock their data entries, but those kinds of things are fun only if there are ""major"" things to do them alongside with.
-Basecamp feels kinda lifeless and boring. I understand that the game shows in cutscenes that there's only you and Max traveling together, but oddly enough your base of operations with it's unoccupied booths is more empty than the rest areas inbetween combat zones filled with npc robots. It could pretty easily made more interesting. Like the music in the camp for example. It only plays near the van. Everywhere else is dead quiet. You could build towards making the camp more like the rest of the game's music with having more energetic music near the van hyping you to start a mission and calmer music further away. Or even simply having the music play everywhere.
-In levels there are these small jump puzzle rooms. A large majority of them are super easy and some can annoyingly damage you. Their rewards are mostly very minor too. And later on with some gadgets you can just skip the vast majority of the puzzles straight to the reward. Could have been way better than the ""I don't really care for them too much, but I guess I'll go grab the tiny reward""-type of deal that they are.",1700296873,1700296873,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Roboquest is oft compared to Gunfire Reborn, mostly for its similarity in format and for the fact that Gunfire Reborn is probably the second best thing in its genre. Seriously, I should stress at the top here, even if you play Roboquest you should also play Gunfire Reborn; if you like one, you'll probably like the other, if not the same amount. You play one of a few classes who gets significant upgrades a couple of times a level through weapons you can find and carry two of at a time, passive items, and perks. You're dropped into a safe zone to prepare, progress through levels full of bad guys with intermittent safe zones, and try to kill everything as fast as possible. 

In raw content, Gunfire Reborn beats Roboquest pretty handily--it has a fairly vast selection of scrolls and weapons, but Roboquest is no slack either. It has a pretty good range of weapons and items, but you will start to see the same ones pretty often. Where Roboquest excels is in its class design; every class is unique, fun and offers a different angle on how to play the game, with a big range of class-specific perks on top of the generic ones to make for a lot of build variety even with the smaller number of classes. In Gunfire it often feels like you're just pumping stats into specific things, but Roboquest gives you super varied and interesting upgrades that feel more significant and really make your build feel like it's evolving significantly throughout the run rather than merely keeping up with scaling. 

Roboquest has much more satisfying combat overall. Enemies are more fun to kill, and it's much more frenetic and fast paced. The game encourages you to be aggressive by making a significant source of recovery during fights, healing cells, drop from enemies in the depths of combat, forcing you to go hard if you want to be able to recover much health. It also encourages it through super fun movement mechanics, including jetpacks, grappling hooks and rail grinding, which add a lot to the game. 

It starts out as a healthy challenge and gets pretty brutal at the highest difficulties if you focus on the time challenge aspect, as you have to be very aggressive to meet S-rank requirements for the highest in-run rewards. You can't afford to spend too much time hiding and baiting out enemy AI.

Everything about Roboquest is just supremely fun. For the few minor complaints I have, I think an elemental combo system and just a couple more elements would be interesting, and I would like if Shock did something else as it's kind of redundant; Shock builds up on enemies and stuns them when it fills up, and Impact, which all non-elemental weapons also deal to some extent, does the same thing. I'd like to see more variety in the items, too, so hopefully the devs continue to pump new content into the game after its 1.0. 

Roboquest is great. Everyone who has any interest in roguelite FPSes should flock straight to this game.",1700225967,1700292539,True,1,0,0.515449404716491699,0,True,False,False

I originally bought the game back when it was still in early access, not expecting much from it. In less than 30 minutes, it had me hooked. I thought to myself ""this game didn't have the right to be this good, wtf is going on?"", the gameplay was fast and intense, with gunplay I had only experienced back when playing Doom Eternal, I was quickswitching guns, bouncing off enemies' heads and throwing fucking rockets at their faces all in the span of 3 seconds, it was epic and I loved it.

But then, the fuckers decided that it wasn't enough to make a good game, so they made it even better. Boom, complete rework of the weapon and item system, new class, new upgrades, new guns, new everything
AND THEN, they released 1.0, which made the game EVEN BETTER. They finished the story, added ANOTHER class, MORE guns, MORE items, and even MORE secrets for us to find. I mean, the amount of stuff that was added on release is ridiculous, the game is just so full of stuff it's hard to keep track of everything
I picked it up and played it for the good part of a week and I was hooked all over again, looking for every secret, exploring every part of every area, mastering each class (still working on that part), I even dabbled into some coop gameplay and I gotta say it was really fun

This is a simple game that connects a bunch of game concepts and puts them together into a mix that can only be described as fucking masterful. They did great at EVERYTHING. I mean, the guns even have ""visual"" sounds so when you shoot the gun goes BRRR or TATATATA and then you reload and it's like CLACK, CLICK which is SO MUCH LIKE BORDELANDS, they didn't need to put that in, but they still did, if that's not fucking dedication I don't know what is.

If you like FPS games, if you like roguelikes, if you just like a simply good game, get this bad boy. It's fun, it's addicting and it's gonna keep you interested for a while.

 i cant think of a single thing i hate about this update. final boss area is awesome, it was a great idea to have it be extra short but extra hard, since many people were already used to corrupted haven being the final level, adding another full length level on top of that might just feel exhausting. great idea there.

havent gotten to try the new class yet but im excited to, and even if i dont like it, every other class already feels great to play. i already have a favorite (green guy) and least favorite (orange commando) but even then i refrain from sticking to my fav and play every other one plenty, even commando if im feeling up for an adventurous self-challenge, and even with him i have fun even if i find it hard to actually win a run.

the enemy destruction and ragdolls are awesome. very satisfying and fun while also easy enough to fly past when youre on a roll.
movement, as always, is obviously pretty much immaculate and lots of fun.

one thing i love about this game over other roguelikes is i feel it is more dependant on skill, and therefore you feel progress through your playtime without it needing to be dependant on unlocks. sure its fun getting a broken build that lets you AFK in other roguelikes but this game always makes me feel so awesome when i really get on a roll, aiming well, positioning well, using movement, rather than relying on just finding one good item to carry me. fantastic design.",1700256566,1700256566,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Takes the best parts of Doom Eternal's combat, carves off the unnecessary bits (glory kills, downtime between fights, etc.) while expertly bolting-on dense robo-roguelite build diversity that should satisfy nearly every player's approach to the genre. The enemies are tough, varied, and interesting in both design and mechanics; none of them useless, nor too strong. The difficulty options are good, and it recommends one based on tutorial performance, which is a nice way to build confidence in the player's abilities (or lack there-of)

The music is incredible and dynamic, so heart-pounding you'll be desperate for another run, and setting up that run is easy and fast, as you'd expect for a roguelite nowadays.

Only one crash/freeze/failure to load; during a Co-op run, the load screen did not finish and we had to abandon the run and restart the game. Otherwise, a bug free experience that is incredibly satisfying to play.

I highly recommend Roboquest! Might be my indie GOTY!

Movement feels slower and less frantic, the difficulty has been ramped up mostly by nerfing the player character and increasing enemy spam, and I don't understand why any of it was done. They had a good thing, but they just like... poured glue all over it.

I put another 20 hours into the game, hoping that after unlocking everything (a tedious and obtuse process) it would get better, but while you unlock a lot more mobility, the key problem of the game punishing you for getting up close and personal, where before it was rewarded, has not changed.

The game's easy as long as you sit back and hide behind corners. The second you try to engage aggressively, you get smacked down. It didn't used to be this way, but now it is, and that's a real shame.

====

If you're looking for a fast-paced FPS with a big variety of guns and playstyles, this is your jam. Play defensively, stealthily, with helper drones, or just be a walking arsenal without picking up a gun in the first place. And each class has a variety of perks to make each playthrough feel just different enough.

Great soundtrack. Solid graphics (these are the most ""work in progress"" feeling at the moment but the game still looks damn pretty). Amazing, fast, fluid movement. The devs appear to be actively listening to their playerbase and implementing sensible changes based on feedback.

A few minor gripes here and there, but nothing worth mentioning besides that ONE of the boss fights is REALLY unintuitive. Once you know the trick, it's a snap, but until then it's pretty murky how to win. Most likely this will be regarded in a future update anyway, and it's already been adjusted. Also I personally hate the enemies that stop your movement and can sometimes blindside you from around corners, but if you pay attention for the most part those guys won't be too bad.

All of this and it's not even close to done, with the projection for 1.0 being August of 2022. This is how to do early access games. Can't wait to see how this turns out and would love to see even more added to the game down the line. I'd happily shell out some extra money for DLC stuff and/or the devs' next game.

Edit: So 1.0 ended up coming out November 2023 but it was worth the wait. Everything I said above still applies other than the graphics have been upgraded, the game is polished and complete, and it's still a lot of fun. It's amazingly well-optimized, I'm running it on Ultra with a 2070 Super and it doesn't overheat my GPU like a lot of other games.

If you enjoyed playing Gunfire Reborn then playing Roboquest is a no-brainer, it shares themes from other games too but nothing as close as Gunfire Reborn. The gunplay is as expected with fluid movement reminiscent of Apex Legends, It's quite well polished and overall very enjoyable to play.

However, at the start you wont notice but there isn't much variety in terms of enemies / bosses. You will probably fight the same five robot types every stage with one or two different unique ones thrown in every so often. The areas also aren't random so you'll find yourself going through the same path over and over with the potential to go through other paths if you find the right keys, though these are pointless as the are often ''secret'' areas which just provide you with unlockables so going through them more than once isn't beneficial. Both the lack of variety from the stages / enemies does take away from the replayability factor but I'm sure more content will come in the future.

The multiplayer is fine with just some minor issues that don't suit me as much, I don't like how pathways and doors are locked if you're playing with someone who hasn't got that key or seen that path yet but I understand why it was done that way. I dislike that reviving your teammate drains your own hitpoints in half, you should only be punished that way if the other teammate ''auto revives'', I know there is an item that stops the HP drain from reviving but you aren't going to get that every run. In my opinion it's a mechanic that needs reworking.

This game is magnificent.
Pros: 
-Co-op
-Endless Fun
-Easy for beginners 
-Hard for advanced
-Grinding capabilities 
-Room to grow with more content

Cons:
-VERY Mild bugs that are barely noticeable (the jet pack being wack sometimes)
-Some time i feel like cells drop more at times than others which... well consistency is key. But its really no big deal.
-Some other minor features that really are not there for casual players

Conclusion:
If you love a borderlands art style, fun gunplay, multiple hours worth of grinding, and love a more smaller dev company than roboquest is for you.

Jokes aside, if you like games that reward skilled movement and good aim, get Roboquest. Sure, it has roguelike elements which come in the form of buffs you can choose from after every level up, however most of your runs are going to rely on you identifying which threat is the most important, where and when you should reposition, and proper knowledge of your guns and items. There are builds, but not one is more broken than the other. If you tend to get hit often, play the Guardian and build around the bubble. Prefer heavy combat and enjoy technical movement with rocket jumping, then pick the Commando. Want to spam crap at enemies? Go Elementalist. This game is truly a great time through and through, and the co-op is really fun as well.

Things I can't stand that this game contains:
TAKES CONTROL AWAY FROM YOU. (Literally makes you complete a QTE to stop being stunned. It's ridiculous, especially for how fast you die when the enemies get easy shots. Also, enemies will ""hack"" your character, and it reverses all the controls. Pretty annoying, especially on the final boss.)
Teleporting enemies (nothing better than an enemy just appearing in front of you and already hit you (sarcasm))
Melee (as essential for at least 2 characters) in a FPS. (all the enemies shoot projectiles, I won't be fighting them hand to hand)
Collecting collectibles. 
Poorly hidden enemies (they are nearly impossible to see at moments, only by a small black wire poking out of a patch of grass...you'll see what I mean when you get there). 
Most of the guns are not worth using. 
Most of the upgrades have negative traits. (i really don't get this, just make it weaker without the negative, same problem returnal had). 
Some rooms can be a bit small. 
Character upgrades really take a long time to understand, (you have to do it so that things balance or work in tandem, but some of the upgrades are unclear or you just aren't sure of their effectiveness...and the runs can get long).
Extremely bullet spongey (that is until you get a 25% damage bonus, one of the reasons I had a hard time finishing it without doing any gadget unlocks or crystals is that I couldn't do enough damage quick enough)

I'm sure there are more, but that is enough. As for the good,

The enemies are already in their spots when you enter the rooms. They do end up teleporting the reinforcements in, but I was at least pleased to see that initial part. (usually these games just teleport all the enemies)
The movement feels good, I switched crouch to shift, and just put always run on. I am not sure why this wasn't default. I did have a problem with the rails though. You are waaay to fast on the rails, because it is basically holding down sprint the whole time. So, I had to counter and hold control (my new sprint key) while I was on the rails, but it definitely makes it a little more difficult when fighting the rail boss (and some of the platforming puzzles). 
When you get the randomizer to give you what you want, it is real fun, can get pretty powerful. Problem is there are those times where it just refuses to give you anything good. After you get the 25% damage boost though it kind of alleviates the bad rolls. 
The perk tree was nice. It was one of the better ones in this game type. It gives you something to keep pushing towards, and each time I unlocked something I wanted to do a new run to see if I could try it out. 

Other notes:
I really only liked the commando, and maybe the engineer, but I really didn't like the others. 
I was really stubborn when I played this. I only ran the default character and didn't unlock much of anything for a long time. I just kept playing through and getting slightly further and unlocking the skill tree, but. I was really struggling to get past the final boss...and man, it sucks when you keep getting an hour and fifteen minutes in just to die and have to start over again. Well, if I wasn't so stubborn, and went down some of the side paths or interacted with the NPCs I probably would have completed the run much earlier. Those unlocks are important because they make the last level much more manageable. It's pretty chaotic when you go in with no crystals or gadgets (and with a character I loathe, the melee default one). So, ya, do yourself a favor and try and complete the side paths, and talk to the NPCs. The map really isn't as confusing as it seems (you can see it in the museum...again, stubborn, never looked at it...plus I thought it was all randomly generated for a couple runs). 

I should mention that this game starts you off with only a double jump, but you will unlock other methods of gaining height, to the point where it makes the platforming puzzles obsolete (and the final boss much easier). Also, spec into the abilities over the guns, Commando gets nuts (but gotta find that special combo). Just so ya know. 

So, this game is good, I enjoyed it, especially with the commando. It is not as good as crab champions but much better than deadlink, IMO.",1700092078,1700092078,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gonna start this review fresh, this is a good shooter early on and a FANTASTIC one toward the end of the meta-game. The movement is good, there's a lot of potential for vertical movement which is always fun, the gunplay is good and there are so many guns, almost to many because I still have trouble remembering how a gun plays from it's name and model in a shop. And while I'm mentioning guns, this game is one does the trait/affix mechanic very very well. They do matter and they do change gameplay significantly, especially for the Blue ones, you're not always gonna re-roll for +damage traits like in most games with this mechanic.

I think the unlock mechanism is very fun. It's very exploration and secrets based but you can figure out everything on your own. It's just fun brain-teasers, not something you'll need to look up a guide to find most of the solutions. The only things that might be a little over-tuned are the timed challenges in some areas but with some practice and better-suited characters, it's manageable.

The other nice thing about the unlock system is how it unlocks alternative levels a little like Dead Cells does. Even tho you *could* beat the game from your first run, it's fun to know there's still new areas with new enemies to explore. The enemies design is also pretty cool. There's very few ""direct upgrades"" and usually every area brings a couple of new enemies with unique shooting patterns and a lot of ""remixes"" who combine together mechanics introduced earlier enemies. There is a large roster of robots which are very well distributed among areas, making each one very unique, not only by the scenery but also their gameplay.

The boss design is also pretty good, with only a couple of boring ones in my opinion. Some of the later ones also have great level embracing the vertical movement.

I haven't played much of co-op but I really like that 1: each players can have their own individual progression and 2: doors and some other features are only unlocked if both players unlocked them. It sounds basic but so many games don't bother with these two (especially the second one). These two things make it so you can jump in with someone at any point in the game and not have everything spoiled for you. And because the unlocks are pretty much all side-path, experienced players don't even care much about spoiling stuff because they can still play forward to try to finish the game. Of course there's gonna be some skill and unlock-gaps but it's not like experienced players are gonna start with a lot of levels and damage over new players. (Although the starting hp upgrades feel like the ones that makes the biggest stats difference.)

The only thing i'm not the biggest fans of is unlocking cards for weapons. It takes forever and kinda discourage me from playing guns I actually enjoy because there's so many to unlock. But in the end, it's not very important to unlock them and there is a way to slightly accelerate that way latter in the game.

Some negative reviews are a disappointed that there's not enough upgrades to build around but that's not really an issue to me. The strength of the game is the fps gameplay and i'm very happy they played into that instead of making winning the game be about building a stupid combo. And that being said, there's still a LOT of synergies to build around with the character upgrades, they just don't overshadow the regular gameplay.

10/10 guns goes pew pew

-------------------------------------------

EDIT: Okay, development is slow but this game is truly a lot of fun. Every update is spot on and the devs really understand which part of their game is the best. Idk when the game will be finished but I have no doubt it will be great because it already is so fun.

-------------------------------------------

Ok, I'll compare this game to Gunfire Reborn a lot. They both are executions of the same formula.

First of all, the core gameplay of of Roboquest is much stronger. You run faster, you jump higher, you can slide on ramps and bounce on robot's heads. Lots of fun.

Second, there is less combos to make in this game. Level up upgrades are well designed for each character and work well with each-other. However, you won't get much going at the beginning because you need a couple of upgrades to get more than 2 choices per levels. Also, it's pretty much the only part where you make a build in the game. Gun affixes are fun but I almost haven't seen any that would synergize in a relevant way. Also there are no ""artefacts"" or ""scrolls"" or whatever to give you extra effects to play with. Instead you get stats which definitely help and create fun choices but it's mostly more damage on the colour of guns you like the most.

Now all of that isn't too much of an issue. In my opinion, Roboquest is more about being a shooter. You get choices but you can quickly choose ""yeah, sure this looks fun"" and get back to shooting. You don't spend too much time looking at every single gun you find and go ""oh I could build like this, or like that if i'm luck"". Again, neither a pro or a cons, just a difference.

Third, Roboquest don't have lots of content yet. It has enough that I wouldn't feel bad suggesting to buy it full price but there are a lot of ""under construction"" areas and probably not much more than 10 guns that I love playing. It's an early access game, the content is coming but it's only fair to warn you.

Lastly, no idea how the multiplayer is. I haven't convinced friends to buy it yet. I'm under the impression that, like Gunfire Reborn, it's a good game singleplayer that also has multiplayer. The cooperation will probably be ""we're all on the same team and shooting at the same things"" and won't go much deeper than that.

Anyway, I love the game. It's a very fun shooter. Don't let the girl guilt-trip you into using her crosshair. Seeing the floor is much more important than the sky, especially in boss battles.",1624049332,1700081867,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True

1.0 comes out, wipes all early access progress and it was even more fun than before playing through the game. The Moon and the final boss fight are both great as well as their soundtracks. My favorite boss is still, and always will be, Sir Catercoaster. The game is just so fun, it always has been. 

Only complaint is the power crystals, everything about obtaining them is unfun.. i would rather eat glass than go through the Fusion Core again.

In early access, this game showed so much promise, despite the obvious lack of content for a good while. And now that it's finally out, I can be safe to say that the developers definitely delivered! During early access the developers accepted a lot of feedback and it really shows. From them changing entire systems, to balance changes, they weren't afraid to listen to what people had to say. Though even from the start, it was still a pretty fun game to pick up every so often. It had pretty consistent quality updates throughout it's EA, each time a new one would come out I'd hop on and have a blast. Between the constant dev support and community feedback, I think Roboquest is a perfect example of early access done right.

Roboquest is a great game. It takes a lot of inspiration from the Borderlands series, however, it very clearly has it's own identity which is great. The amazing visuals, topped with smooth movement and great gun play make this game a wonder to play. The designs for the robots are awesome, a lot of names for things are fun or cute (they have a robot vendor called Heisenbot). Like there's so many little guys, I LOVE IT. The music is also great for what it is. The roguelike is a lot less RNG dependent than other games in the genre. There are runs that are clearly better than others, however you can win any run if you have the skills to which I really enjoy. There's a ton of fun weapons, upgrades, and secrets to keep you engaged for quite a while.

The new 1.0 update is honestly a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. When they said that the next update would be 1.0 I thought the game was going to have missing areas since there were like 8 places labeled ""under construction"", but nope! They added like 20 new npcs too, like it feels like I'm in completely new areas even though I have played through them many times in EA. It's very good that the update didn't feel like it was just slapped onto the previous version, it makes the final version of the game feel complete and connected.

Bosses are fun and fast-paced and don't feel samey. 

The perks in particular are thoughtful and progress well and stack without feeling too overpowered. You definitely feel the impact of a great set of perks but it's still best to play optimally and tactically. Same goes for items. 

The classes are very competitively balanced and each offer interesting ways to build without compromising a familiar flow of play. I often swap between at least 3. Sometimes what you have a mind to do suggests a different class! 

Progress feels very unique, with the mission flow being the standard, but choosing your path in real time can lead to new unlocks and fun challenges. Runs aren't too long and it's rewarding to try tp collect the perks and guns you want.

My ONLY suggestion is that the automatic weapons feel a little undertuned. As someone who doesn't go crazy over the more meme guns, weapons like the SMGs, LMGs and ARs could use a little love! But I still get plenty kick out of the rifles, pistols, and shotguns.

OLD PRE-1.0 REVIEW:
[h1] This game has: [/h1]

Gameplay somewhere between Doom, Gunfire Reborn, Arena Shooters such as Quake, garnished with Ghostrunner in music and pace

Movement third only to Ghostrunner and Warframe

Clean, responsive, and fast shooting

Variety of classes and builds/subclasses

Variety of weapons

Variety of styles of level, though not level concepts/designs

A well tuned (IMHO) difficulty ramp per-run

Good optimization

Ability to bonk robots back to horny jail

[h1] This game could use [/h1]

A few weapon buffs (Fire gun, MINE GUN, to name a couple)

An ending or endless continuation system (seeing as the game is in early access however, this is likely already in progress)

Greater sense of overall progression (if you've played loot based games before and/or check weapons frequently, this is less prevalent, however for most people the game will feel largely the same from fresh to completion as of now)

Re-balancing of gadgets (initial/constant skills chosen before a run). Currently IMHO the gadgets are pretty cut and dry on which ones are the best.)

And more, but these are the ones I find to be the most self-evident and agreeable.

Overall I HIGHLY recommend this game, personally, if you like fast paced shooters. Notice I did not add rogue-likes/lites there. Unless you are used to making body pillows of every gun you pick up in other games, I think most will find this game's approach a wonderful time. Speaking for myself, I had tried Hades last year and stopped playing after ~7-8 hours as it hadn't quite hooked me. Roboquest made me want to revisit pretty much every rogue-like/lite in my library, and made me fall in love with the rogue-like formula again.

They're both roguelite shooters where you can play as different characters (or use different classes in Roboquest) that have unique abilities. Every weapon you find will have modifiers that go from changing their stats around to adding mini-mechanics to them (particularly in Gunfire Reborn).
That's it. They don't have anything else in common outside of their base idea. The 2 games aren't interchangeable at all.

Roboquest doesn't shower you in resources during your runs. Its a fast paced game with a heavy focus on clearing a level as fast as possible and as well as efficently as possible to gain better rewards. Said rewards are robo-batteries, the money of this game. Its required for upgrading the guns you have, buy new guns and items, etc. So you'll really want to be fast and efficient for the best rewards.

In terms of movement, Roboquest is really good. You can run, double jump and slide. There's also rail-grinding, jump pads and stage hazards that shake up a lot of the arenas. If you're good at schmooving you can find yourself at the top of these arenas where there's often collectibles hidden up there. I'll touch on that later.

Enemies in this game are also pretty agressive. Even the first stage enemies are good at aiming and have multiple projectiles (a mine and their regular gun). There's also a lot of them in every arena. Not a comical ammount, but enough that even at your best your gonna be hit a few times. And they only get harder with each stage by shooting more bullets at once, gaining different elements (Burn, freeze and shock) adnd even adding new mechanics like flying, having smoke bombs and even teleporting.
Enemy variety is pretty good, but they are all a variantion of one of the few type of enemies in the game. You have turrets, small puntable robots, your standard grunts, drones, etc. There's also bosses obviously, which are all locked to a certain area and never get switched around.

Okay, now for the combat. It is BEAUTY. The combat is as fast paced as the race of the game is. There's no remaining ammo to worry about, all you have to worry about is if you gun is reloading/cooling from overheating. And its all done quickly, with some great ammo, sound and visual flair. Like, you know how gunfire is shown on comic books? Yeah they do that while they shoot, its great.
Outside of reloading, all the weapons fire quickly and accurately too. It all keeps the flow of the game quick, even if you decide to stomp every enemy you encounter.
There's not that many weapons though. Each are unique in how they feel but each are part of one of the larger weapon type (rifles, automatics, shotguns, explosives, etc). Depending on the class you play, you'll end up using a certain type, since all classes (minus the Guardian, the default class) cater to one or two specific ones.

One thing that makes Roboquest stand out from other roguelite shooters is the level up mechanic. Murking robots actually gives EXP, and EXP allows you to choose a perk for the whoel run. It seems you can get up to lvl 15 max. EXP gain is actually the second thing you're graded on for your final rank when clearing a level
Outside of that, you can still buy object that boost some things, like how powerful an element is or by causing an explosion when reloading.

And finally, progression. Doing multiple runs back to back in this game won't make them repetitive, at least for 4/7 levels. There's different paths you can take in the first 3 levels, each leading to different zones. There's even paths to ""corrupted"" zones, where the enmies will just murder you.
Each of these zones have collectible and mini-sidequests. Each level has data journals that give you a glimpse in the lore of the game. There's keys to collect that give you access to other zones. Some doors even require a code, or a certain ammount of batteries, or even a specific upgrade. Theres also some old robots you can find that require certain items to give you something.

All in all, if you like roguelite shooters, or just fast shooters in general, this game is an absolute MUST.
It's absolutely worth its 25$.

Even the mini boss rooms that have waves of enemies are beaten by just going in a circle.

Some other disappointments
The level up upgrades seemed very underwhelming. I felt that it was a rare occurrence when I actually got shown something that seemed even remotely powerful, even less so when I wanted it for my build. 

Maybe the specific classes aren't supposed to be very defining? I felt that their abilities weren't very fun.
A rocket that does meh damage, and even more dinky shotgun
An invuln shield
A spear you throw

The game features an intense gameplay focusing on movement and gunplay. Movement in this game feels amazing, it is very fluid and has many different options to choose from. You can chain these moevement patterns together for maximum speed. Dash across the map, then slide for a quick speed boost, jump directly afterwards on an enemy head and use the momentum to launch even higher to get on a platform. It's really cool how well these fit together and how fluid the gameplay feels thanks to that.
Maintaining a high speed is very important since at the end of each level you get a rating based on how many enemies you have killed and how fast you were, so to get the best rating you have to kill most enemies as fast as possible. Getting a high rating isn't just for show, you get a currency at the end that you can use to pay at shops.

The gunplay is also fantastic. The game has  alot of different guns and the developers made sure that each one feels unique and impactful. You have basic weaponry like handguns, assault rifles and shotguns but you also get some crazy guns like a lightning assault rifle or a cannon that fires massive, exploding snowballs. These weapons have all their own abilities but additionally they can also get randomized abilities. Weapons with higher rarity have more special effects and in some cases they may even have a secondary firing mechanic. Weapons also have levels, which decide how strong the damage of the weapon is. The level of a weapon is defined by the level it drops in, so you will switch out weapons often to stay on an even level. You can also upgrade your weapon in a shop if you had a very good weapon drop that you don't want to lose. By default you can carry only two weapons and the game has a unqiue mechanic to encourage player using both weapons frequently. When you use a weapon during combat, the other weapon in your backpack automatically reloads. Speaking of ammo, ammo is unlimited, so you never run out.

Additionally to weapons, the game also uses a character class and perk system. There are six different classes in the game and each class has their own upgrade perks as well as a few common perks that all classes share. The class perks can even be upgraded further with two different upgrades. During your run you get experience for killing enemies and every time you level up you can select one perk of a random selection from your aviable perks. All perks stack with each other and the generic perks can even be obtained multiple times. Perks generally affect eoither your ability, your weapons or your character in general. Choosing your perks carefully defines what kind of build you will be going for.

During your runs you can also get some items, either from chests or from the shop. You won't get many items during a run but they provide nice passive boosts to your character. They also stack with your perks, which means you can improve your build even further. 

The game has a few metaprogression elements as well. Enemies have a chance to drop wrenches, which can be used to buy permanent upgrades at the base between runs. These upgrades generally increase the amount choices in chests and in stores and also increase the chances for stores appearing. There are also a few upgrades that apply directly for your character, like extra health for example.  There are also sectret levels in the game and beating those unlocks crystals, which, when activated from your base, provide a passive bonus but also increase the amount of elite enemies you will face during your run. And you can find some friendly robots during your runs, usually at some secret locations, which will give you a quest. If you finish those quests, you get a gadget in return, which is a permanent item that you can activate or deactivate at your base. 

The games art design mirrors the looks of a comic book, even the cutscenes are designed in that way. Character models use cell-shading and sound effects are written out on the screen. It is a cool look that I personally like.
The soundtrack, done by Noisescream, features heavy metal music and electronic sounds, a fitting choice for a futuristic action game full of robots and metal violence. It's an absolute banger to listen to.

Overall I would recommend this game to people who love shooters with fast and intense action and also like rogue-lite elements. I want to point out at the end, this is a FPS first and a rogue-lite second. You have more focus on the action part of the game  and your actual skill in shooting and dodging than creating a broken build that carries your weak ass. There are some broken builds in this game but it's not the main focus. If that sounds like fun to you, go ahead and buy this, you won't regret it.",1699824926,1699824926,True,1,0,0.530201315879821777,0,True,False,False

Incredible gunplay, great variety in the different classes and weapons/items.
Very nice music, though it does get a bit repetitive at times, but that's normal given that it's a roguelite and you're bound to be listening to the same tracks over and over.
The visuals are top notch too, I really like the cell shaded artstyle overall.
Really the only particularly negative thing I can say about this game is that it kind of... lacks character.
As the title makes clear, this game's about robots on a quest, and that's all it really is about. Robots.
You play as a generic looking robot, with your color depending on the class you picked and you fight enemy robots which are all some sort of variation of what you would see in one of the Portal games.
You fight and make your way through generic looking arenas, which are all basically somewhere on the Ruins-High Tech Facility scale, with the latter levels basically just being High Tech Facility + purple boxes everywhere.
The robots you play as all look exactly the same save for your color, the robots you fight against are, again, almost all just a generic white robot with a red eye in the middle that signals ""shoot here for critical damage!""
Its definitely something nitpicky and if this doesn't bother you at all then great, the game is basically perfect. 
But when there's so many games like this that all have their own unique aesthetic and vibe which stand out from each other a lot, Roboquest just kind of feels generic.
Either way, the game plays great, feels great and looks great(being generic looking aside) and if you like roguelites or FPS', it's definitely a great pick",1699821670,1699821670,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: Roguelite FPS with a variety of weapons. Really appreciate the easy modes for casuals, relaxing with a podcast and for introducing friends; If you want more of a challenge you can turn the difficulty right up.

Cons: Common weapons and common modifiers flood the drop pools, meaning one play through will be very similar to the next. You don't find enough variety or legendary drops or items to make runs significantly different. There's no explanation or hints for unlocking gadgets. When looking at modifiers there's no telling if it applies to your weapon or what difference it would make.

The artstyle is dope, and the music fits great!

The roguelite element does mean you will not get much further than the first 2~3 levels in your first few runs, and then later you will blow through those first few levels like it's nothing, but with the solid shooting mechanics it's still loads of fun.

Upgrading the central hub also changes up the visuals to really reinforce the feeling of progression, which is a really neat touch.

Runs can be a bit long, and the game urges you to play like an optimal maniac, so I'll tell you up front to separate your runs into two categories: 

A) Beating the game being as strong as possible 
B) Missing out on clear rewards to find secrets. (And there are a lot of secrets)

IMO, the game does need some improvements to the UI to help make things a bit easier to navigate (please let me use my cursor in the tab menu), and some kind of run saving function would be amazing. It actually takes quite a bit of time to get to the ending area of the game, and it would be really nice to have a way to pause the run if I need to jet, and bonus points if I can do that during CO-OP play! 

Normally with games that hit their 1.0 release coming out of early access, there's an underwhelming groan in fear of not having enough content, but I can confidently say that the game is fully worth it's release, AND sale price, and I'm honestly surprised it's not extremely popular right now.

There's a lot of replayability through unlocking base upgrades (permanent buffs for your character), new routes to take during a run and gadgets (passive abilities that persist between runs). The variety in abilities/skills for each class also allows for a lot of experimentation which I enjoy.

Playing on Hard. Three classes unlocked, about 20 runs in. The game is moderately fun and runs well. Unfortunately there are some design choices that just make this below average for me. 

Enemy density is very high. It not because there are too many enemies, its because the space to fight them is too small. You are packed into relatively narrow corridors, and the arena sections, with up to 20 enemies spawned simultaneously, which are aggressive and follow you around corners, feel like you are supposed to stay mobile and side strafe around every projectile. Up to 20 simultaneous projectiles is a lot to ask the player to dodge, and arenas are so small that you are bumping into enemies constantly if you are on the move.

The comparison to gunfire reborn is fair, these are very similar games and it is hard not to compare the two. The graphics are better. The art is worse.  The shooting feels better. The balance is worse. 

Ultimately this game is most hampered by the map design. The environments are small, at least half as large as the previously mentioned game while also containing a larger amount of more aggressive enemies. There is a middle ground between needlessly large maps and feeling like you are wading through a crowd. Arenas need to be larger. 

Alternatively, spawn enemies from pre-determined points or entrances. The idea of enemies spawning in randomly and evenly spaced throughout the arena, including behind you, without notice, adds to the frustration of the enemy density.

If the devs' idea of balance is to simply make the player characters so overpowered that they can clear rooms instantaneously, then ultimately that is not as fun an experience as other games I have played in the same genre. Not there yet power-wise, but I can see the direction the player power is going. A few more perks, a little more gun progression, and these arenas will likely not feel like such a slog. But overall, I'm not a fan of countering poor design with overwhelming, time gated, player power. There is serious potential for a fun, movement and momentum based game, but the realities of the design choices actively hamper that playstyle. Doesn't feel tactical, doesn't feel skill based. The correct option is to hang back and hope you have a strong enough weapon to clear enemies quickly as they round the corner for you.  Eventually I'll just get an elemental minigun that mows down enemies, and that is the solution to the maps and arenas being designed for ants.

This game feels fast paced. It's comic/cartoon graphic style is just beautiful the guns feel great to use. The four different robots all feel like unique approaches to combat. Everything in the game feels polished and smooth. The bosses could use a little more work and a system to make dropped items/items you don't want be turned into money or health would be great. A smidgen more customisation, one MAYBE two more levels would be great. Local co-op maybe?

The shooter gameplay is up there with Doom 2016 and your skill as a player always feels like it is at the forefront. The levels have a branching system with secrets allowing you to make choices multiple times in each run. Plus the choices start pretty early so runs continue to feel fresh. The speed bonuses, the side rooms, and the extermination bonuses manage to make both speed runner and completionist play styles feel rewarding while subtly pushing you to improve so you can achieve both.

The only downside I can think of is that co-op caps at 2 players. It was designed for 2, so it plays very tight in co-op. However, if a crew of 3-4 come together you'll have to play something else that night.

Game is amazing on full release devs hit the hammer on the head with good game play, amazing movement and fun gunplay, high number of viable builds for each class, challenging difficulty, number of the bad reviews are coming from people complaining about game wipe on full release, but I am not sure what they expected from an EA game, and it was announced this would happen in a number of locations, it takes 6-9 hrs to get the meaningful upgrades that make the game easier, and enjoyable from different avenues which is not to much time if you ask me.

I can't wait to see what kind of support the devs carry on to provide, or what they go on to next after roboquest once they decide to finish supporting RQ.

Probably one of the best FPS games I have played in years, the game does you want a fast paced FPS rogue lite to do. The movement is so fun and clean in this game that I could spend hours just running around maps if I wanted to without shooting mobs. the rogue lite elements are fun and rarely feel to over the top  or like you are flat being carried. Every death is normally your fault so if you are prepared to step back and take a look at your self and your play style you can learn how to overcome each challenge with out feeling purely carried by 1 item or build. Not only this but the game is doing EA right, it is trying things, when the updates are bad for what ever reason the devs listen to the community so well, and fix things either in the next path or with in days. To the point they even delayed one of their bigger updates because on a public test people did not like a few mechanics, and they flat scrapped it and remade it for the better. The devs are making a game of passion with this one.

- Boomer and Arena Shooters (Doom, Unreal Tournament, etc.)
- Roguelikes (kind of obvious)
- Not needing a beefy PC to play it (My main rig is pretty new, but I can't wait to try it on Steam Deck!)

Combat: Fast paced fights at a variety of ranges. Tons of weapons available at the start of the game, and more of them appear after a certain point in a run. Guns all feel good and many have clear inspiration from other games. I was pleasantly surprised to see both the Shock Rifle and Flak Cannon have expies here, as well as some weapons I can't really make a comparison for. Weapons drop at a decent pace and the power level of them increases per area. Comparing loot is fast and not a drag. Character skills and loadouts look simple on paper, but what you can do with them is a lot more in practice, particularly when character specific skill upgrades appear in a run. I like how the game helps keep the chaos manageable by giving you warning arrows for enemies that are nearby, so you don't get completely screwed by enemies you don't hear or when you forget to check your minimap.

Sights and Sounds: This game's artstyle instantly reminds me of Atlas Reactor/Rogues and comic book text accompanies every weapon when it's fired. Enemies are robots, you're a robot. In fact, I think the only character that isn't a robot is your story companion, who gives dialogue before each level and in rest areas. Sound effects are satisfying and punchy. The music is electronic with a variety of sounds from genres all over the past 20 years or so. Driving beats are common throughout, with nearly any kind of synth you can imagine from the height of industrial to anything that sounds akin to Pendulum's latest releases. Certified bangers throughout!

Performance: My rig is high end, with an i5 13600KF CPU, RX 6800XT GPU, and 32 GB of RAM. Loading time between levels is only a few seconds on a hard drive. The game defaulted to Ultra and I haven't had to glance at the settings. It runs perfect on my 144hz monitor at 8x AA and with everything turned up. In fact, my previous PC is 9 years old and was mid-high range back then, and it is still above the system requirements. If you have a potato, try the demo.

Progression: Good surprises throughout. I appreciate having a lot of guns to begin with, since bad roguelikes will make you throw yourself at the wall a hundred times before you see something fresh. My only gripe is after hours of me and a friend getting stuck around the same point to unlock another character. We were blazing through earlier zones but making 0 progress to beating a level. I turned the difficulty down to unlock the character myself, turned the difficulty back up, then played with my friend once more. We got to the final area the first time, but not because this character is OP or anything like that, but because it just suited my playstyle a lot more. Permanent upgrades affect your weapon drops, extra passive effects for your character, and the frequency that vendor/upgrade encounters happen in rest areas. Even if you fail a run, you still get a good amount of wrenches, the main currency for these upgrades.

Randomness: I really like the tiles in this game. None of them are squares and all take on interesting layouts for encounters and can string together interesting upper sections if your character can reach them. You will also encounter optional zones and platforming puzzles for extra rewards that vary greatly in difficulty, but will never kill you in one mistake if you decide to back out of one. I enjoy the guns to begin with, but the random upgrades take it a step farther. Of course, there are your expected passive bonuses. But what I appreciate are extra elements like random secondary fire modes that make guns feel even more distinct than games like Borderlands or Gunfire Reborn (Gunfire's guns are highly creative and can have unique random properties, but always have the same fire modes.). I've never felt like runs have a ""make or break"" build path to get far except the previously mentioned instance when I had to lower the difficulty to unlock a character I meshed well with. Finally, when you start getting character specific upgrades during a run, the game will make related upgrades appear more often so you can realize a build based on those upgrades on pretty much every run.

Multiplayer: Although the game is limited to 2 players, I appreciate this decision. The tiles are at a good size and making them bigger would either make 1 and 2 player runs feel too large for the enemy count or force the dev to make entirely new tiles for extra players. As for the experience itself, I've had no issues with connecting to games, staying connected, or any cases of lag. My internet is proper crap and this game can run on it a-ok. There isn't much that any character can do to interact with one another but you can at least share dropped weapons. Pickups are per player, so if an enemy dies and drops health for you, you don't have to worry about stealing potential healing from your friend. This is very much a single player kind of experience, but I appreciate the dev putting enough thought and care into the two player mode to not deviate from the original experience.

Pros:
A lot of the weapons have impact and interesting to play with, builds are diverse and easy to riff on a play-style you enjoy, secrets are interesting and rewarding, meta upgrades aren't extremely power defining and mostly open up options to play with.  The difficulty curve is steep at first but levels off nicely once you learn the enemies patterns.  Bosses are fun and offer very unique challenges to most of the game.  A ton of the perks and upgrades feel ""build-defining"" while easily slotting into whatever play-style you enjoy.

Cons:
Some of the weapons feel extremely under-tuned, even with good affixes and a build that should play to their strengths; this is especially true of some of the snipers which have extremely long between shot animations which make them feel clunky and slow in an otherwise fast-pace environment.  Damage from explosions and ""aoe projectiles"" stacks up ~maybe slightly too fast when you get cornered and easily leave you feeling helpless.

now that that is over. here is the review part for the consumer... just get it. its amazing. and its also not super expensive (compared to most games out there these days.) here is why you should get it:
1. it has little to no bugs (that I've seen.)
2. it has challenge for all ranges of people.
3. you really can play at whatever play style you want. there is so many combos to use and so many unique things with the classes that you can make the game what you want it to be. do you like sniping? oh boy does it feel good to get good at that in this game. do you like crazy fast firing weapons with a temporarily unlimited and boosted mag? you can do that. do you simply want to blow everything up? go for it. the world is your oyster.
4. the movement is nice and polished feeling and the game requires you to be good at it for the higher difficulties. 
5. it has an amazing soundtrack.

all that being said i do have some small critiques and that would be i wish it could get more difficult. after a while it felt like i hit the ceiling of skill and i couldn't to much more to make it more difficult for myself. however, after i got to that point i proceeded to spice things up by putting challenges on myself and because of the insane amount of customization that kept me entertained for a while. 

so in conclusion the game is amazing and has tons to offer (especially if you are willing to be a bit creative for yourself and make cool new challenges) so you should totally buy it and support the devs.

Gunfire Reborn, Mother Gunship, Tower of Guns, Risk of Rain 2 (though that ones third person) are all much better than this one in my opinion.  It has potential but there is are a couple things that hold it back. 

My big problem is there isn't so much a difficulty curve as a solid brick wall.  I'm fairly experienced with High speed FPS games like this, Gunfire Reborn is very similar and I can fairly reliably beat high level reincarnation runs in that so I have some experience.  I started playing on hard mode and my first run got through the first boss no problem.  I've had a few runs that I've gone all but hit less through the first boss.  The first level after the boss knocks me down almost every time.  I have gotten through it maybe 4 times and have not once made it to the second boss. There are too may different enemies with too may different attacks that are too fast and even the smallest enemies take a good bit of focus fire to kill.  The game just does not give you the tools to handle it all.

So what is it that makes the game feel that way?

First the slide just feels bad.  It should be your best option for quick dodging but its barley faster than just running, and if you don't jump before its done you loose all momentum, but slide jumping locks you in moving  single direction for too long and allows the AI to get perfectly aimed leading shots on you. I just feel like I do better if I ignore slide exists. 

Second I just don't feel much impact form upgrades. Some of the level up perks are pretty good, i particularly enjoy the min rockets but a lot especially items are barely noticeable.  I went all in on an elemental lightning build but all it really amounted to was doing a bit more damage with guns that deal lightning damage, and the increase was if i remember correctly rather than hitting for 17 i hit for 20 with a full auto weapon.  This may just be because I'm not getting further in but 5 levels and 4+ items and most options just feel like they barely exist. 

Third, while the guns are fun they feel balanced weird.  Long range weapons in general feel a lot better than close range ones.  Whether your talking damage, fire rate, clip size, or reload speed the shortest range weapons just feel so outmatched. Pistols all just feel so slow to reload when you are up close to be in their effective range. Shotguns don't do enough damage, especially considering they all have pretty wide spreads and crit spots are comparatively small.  The slowdown from heavy weapons is especially punishing because as mentioned before you don't have a reliable dodge. Sniper rifles, Arquebus, and Carbine can all 1 or 2 shot average enemies, have good fire rates, more ammo, and decent reloads and the extra range makes it much easier to dodge incoming attacks.  It just feels like closer range weapons should get something to compensate. 

There is a lot of potential here but I just feel like it has some kinks to work out before that potential is realized.",1699587143,1699587143,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Oh yeah, this is the one. 

I picked this up early on during the early access period and was waiting for the 1.0 drop to finally leave a review. It's incredible to see how the devs have adapted and continuously improved upon the game as a response to feedback.

If you're a fan of games like Doom, Apex Legends, Borderlands or other shooter roguelites such as Gunfire Reborn, Deadlink and Mothergunship, you'll absolutely love this game. 

Honestly, there's no reason to carry on reading. If you like any of those above, you'll enjoy this. 

But in case you want more info ->

[h2] What Makes Roboquest Stand Out [/h2]

You could throw together a list of roguelite benefits, and it could apply to more than ten games. So, I'll tell you why I like this, and you can see if that jives with what you enjoy:

[list]
[*] A killer soundtrack that adapts to whether you're fighting or in a safe zone. And seriously, the soundtrack is amazing. 
[*] Simple roguelite system that feels meaningful
[*] Snappy, fast and fun gun play 
[*] Game play that is part character & build and part gun play, making it so the guns you use are relevant to your damage and play style
[*] A focus on movement and always being engaged
[/list]

I think a large part of why I enjoy this more than other roguelite options is because you're always engaged. There's no praying to the RNG gods that you get two items that complement each other, and you can just AFK. Nor is there a build-a-giant convoluted deck mechanic back at the base. 

It genuinely feels like a carefully crafted shooter that puts being in the action first, which, for me, is exactly what I want from a shooter - roguelite or otherwise. 

It also has coop with a friend, and while I understand other games - such as Gunfire Reborn and Risk of Rain, have more coop slots, I think it makes total sense for how this game plays. 

At the heart of it, it feels like a single-player roguelite experience that you just have a blast playing. The fact that they went the extra mile to create room for a friend is a bonus for me. 

[h2] The Roguelite Elements [/h2]

As you progress through each run, you're awarded with Wrenches. You can get these via rare drops from enemies, by finding collectables or from beating areas. 

The amount you receive from beating areas is based on a score. You're scored on your total EXP earned (how many enemies total you beat), the time it took you to complete the level and a small bonus depending on your difficulty. 

You then use these to make permanent upgrades in between each run. These upgrades feel meaningful - not X% to damage or something like that, but actual choices that impact how you play or what you may find in the next run. 

You can also discover new characters, unlock new gadgets (passive items for your runs) and a new crystal mechanic that influences the final area, which has been added for 1.0.

Since the wrenches are tied to finishing levels, they never feel like a grind to get. While you require more for future upgrades, there's a lot in the game, with different routes to keep you engaged. 

[h2] Replayability [/h2]

If you are playing the game normally - meaning you aren't trying to speed run - runs will take at least 30 minutes, which may sound like a fair amount of time when compared to other games. This is, of course, assuming you beat the run. 

The combination of the extremely good soundtrack, large number of unique and fun weapons, and character build differences helps keep each run feeling fresh, even if you run them back to back. 

You have multiple characters, each with their own distinct play style - an engineer that summons minions, stealthy stabby characters, a defensive invulnerable character and so on. 

So there's a lot you can change to freshen up the experience when you feel you need to. 

[h2] Fun Factor [/h2]

The game is a blast. 

Your character and weapon choice definitely impact the way you play the game. You can choose to be quick and blast through things or pick a weapon that suits a more in-the-back, relaxing style. The fast movement limits the downtime between encounters and the other mechanics in place help increase the options you have while making for some incredibly fun moments. 

On top of the standard gun play stuff, there's also:

[list]
[*] Rail grinding to get around/dodge projectiles
[*] Headbouncing on enemies to reset your jump and deal damage
[*] Unlockable doors/alternate routes during runs
[*] Hidden collectables 
[*] Interesting boss mechanics
[/list]

And thought I'd note there's no collision damage either thankfully. 

[h2] Is it worth the buy? [/h2]

100%

Especially so if you have a friend that's open to playing it with you. 

Each run feels quite unique and there's a lot to unlock. Not to mention, the devs are incredible at fine-tuning the experience to make it more enjoyable and listen to feedback. I have no doubt that they'll continue to improve upon this already great 1.0 release in the future.",1699573667,1699573667,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

EARLY ACCESS
The game has had a ton of content added since launch and now I think it's in a good enough spot to recommend for anyone looking for a roguelite FPS. Gunplay, as a whole, is absolutely great. The movement system, weapon variety, gun feel, and the skills/perks/cores all come together to make a fun experience that varies a lot from run to run.	[/strike]

--

The 1.0 version is great! There's been a lot added in terms of quests and exploration which provide the player with a lot more to plan out during each run. The progression mechanics went through many changes during early access, and the developer used that period and the feedback received to end up with a system that feels varied and exciting on every run, with every character.

This means, I didn't get all the secret data-logs that really didn't seem to serve a purpose. Even after that, I played this game a ton - it's just simply a good Rogue-Like FPS. 

After the 1.0 release; a lot has changed. For the better! There's more to do. What SEEMS like a better balance, from what I've played. I love the game's atmosphere after the stuff that was in Early Access. 

Now, some criticisms. 

There's a level that's about racing the time and the room for error on it is frustratingly small. It also makes you fail a run, which takes about a minute or two of game play (not including loading and restarting, picking level ups, grabbing weapons, etc). It just became very, very frustrating - as I am not good at those kinds of things and I had to spend an hour or two trying to beat that level. 

The classes feel way more restrictive than they used to. In the Early Access I felt like I had more viable choices when playing. Now, it feels like each class requires basically the same choices with minor tweaks. 

And to be honest, some weapons just feel completely worthless because they don't work with any build specifically. 

And one final criticism, there are builds/classes where they're melee based. They largely are just kind of shallow experiences. There's no reason to hunt weapons, which means there's very little reason to get power cells. It becomes extremely linear. Don't get me wrong, you're very powerful but, that's what makes it so formulaic - run towards  the enemy holding down the melee button, occasionally use special. 

Other than those criticisms, I can't praise the game enough.",1699567950,1699567950,True,2,0,0.537572264671325684,0,True,False,False

After beating Iris' second phase, I just heard a bunch of noise while staring at a black screen. Great job, devs. Really great work. So glad I lost all my previous progress so I could see this new black screen!

After having beaten the entirety of the (current) game's content, there is sadly an insanely lacking amount of rogue-lite content in this game. If you beat the game four times, you'll have unlocked every last thing, and worst of all, they do almost nothing to make runs different. 

The best thing this game offers is the gunplay, which is amazingly smooth. Almost every gun is punchy and satisfying to use, with some being far, far more fun than others, regardless of effectiveness. The second thing this game has is the aesthetic. The maps are bright and vibrant, even when they're set in grungier environments. 

Sadly, those are the only positives of the game. Though they're the core features, they just aren't enough to make the game currently worth it. 
The leveling up system is absolutely horrendous, as it involves killing enemies and picking up their ""cells"" before they expire. It takes maybe 6 seconds for them to vanish, meaning you have to fight in close quarters (or get lucky with a weapon that picks them up on crit, but that's supremely rare from my many runs) or risk never leveling up. On top of that, the cells heal you if you get damaged, so they're insanely important for things that just vanish in almost no time at all. 

For endgame content, there is absolutely none. There are absolutely no benefits for beating the game's 8 difficulties. No upgrades, no unlockables, and no advancements. You can get absolutely everything with NG+2 
The difficulties in the game go as follows: Easy, Standard, Heroes, Heroes+1, Heroes+2, Heroes+3, Heroes+4, Heroes+5, Heroes+6)

Furthering this awful design that leaves absolutely no incentive for you to play harder difficulties, you get almost no bonus upgrade components. I got more components from a winning run on the same route through NG+2 than I did on NG+6. Adding onto that, you get the same amount of XP from enemies, meaning you'll always end up being just as strong. Getting every single cell from every single enemy in every run from NG+1 to NG+6, I always ended up at Level 11. I'd hit Level 12 when I beat the final boss, but then the game ends. 

I held onto the hope that SOMETHING would happen when I beat the game on its highest difficulty, in which enemies just do ridiculous damage, and yet there was not a thing. The game just cuts away and ends. 

My favorite part of any game in these genres is getting stronger, even if only incrementally. I'd even take unlocking things that don't make you stronger, so long as there is SOMETHING to make playing the game after completion worth it, especially when you have SIX extra difficulties. How can you justify that level of challenge when you don't even give the players anything extra? 

This is a very unrewarding game to play through, and I was only able to muddle through each difficulty because the gunplay is satisfying and smooth. There are currently 3 bosses I could find in this game (It seems they removed one of the boss's from a few months ago), and the final boss of the game is just...the worst thing ever. The first two bosses are the peak of passable. They're just grindy, but so long as you just don't stop moving, and occassionally jump, you really can't lose. Then you reach the final boss, at which point the developers seem to have given up and decided to make the most poorly designed boss they could think of. It's essentially the game throwing a non stop series of attacks at you from an enemy that can kill you in 3 hits, but survive 3 minutes of unending gunfire from insanely powerful weapons. Add to this 3-5 invincibility phases (they're brief if you act quickly, but are still annoying) and something that automatically locks you in place and you just have the least fun final boss in almost any shooter. 

Though I hate to make comparisons due to the games being somewhat different at their core, this game doesn't hold even a match to Gunfire Reborn. At their cores, the games are similar, but at a glance, RoboQuest has far superior gunplay. Outside of that though, everything else falls short. Roboquest has no endgame content, and nothing to reward the player for beating the game at any point, or at any difficulty. The map design is great until you hit the final level, in which they just make a horribly unoptimized mess of a map that begins draining any fun out of the experience, then finish it off with a boss that removes any traces of a smile from your face. 

This is a game that is at its best when you're playing for the first 3 hours. After that, you've seen everything it has to offer. The game is done. There is nothing more for you aside from the mere ability to say ""I did it. I beat Heroes+6 and got nothing for it.""",1611143493,1699565316,False,6,1,0.491923063993453979,0,True,False,True

You can play the game however you want. The wide variety of weapons, perks, and upgrades allow you to fashion every run to your own preferred playstyle. Wanna keep your distance and snipe enemies? Go for it. Wanna punch enemies in the face and blast them with a shotgun? Jump right in. Whether you're speedrunning or just going for a chill completion, Roboquest has plenty of options for both.

My ONLY complaint about this game comes from the performance. I usually run on HIGH settings, and even my 32GB of ram and 4070 can struggle to keep up. I don't often notice the drops in framerate, but it's enough that I don't dare play on ULTRA. Granted, you can easily reduce the graphics of this game without many consequences.

It has a simple premise, a ton of weapons to make each run feel completely different, items to find such as data logs and tickets that give you access to various areas, 6 classes who have different abilities and upgrades, and many more.

So I'm back after tasting the final verion on closed beta and finishing the game after the release. Well the game is phenomenal!
I really dig that still after that many hours the music still feels heroic and inspiring! The gameplay as smooth as cutting butter with a hot knife.
The quality this small group of fantastic individuals put into this piece is over the top!

Hopefully you've gotten at least some fraction of my emotions I have for this game. Wish the devs the best and keep it up, the world is in need of this quality of gaming! <3

It's a very fun and engaging rogue lite fps. The gunfight feels INCREDIBLE. Every attack as oomph, every weapon is unique and it's simply a good combo between shooting and movement. The build diversity is a bit less deep than a game like Gunfire Reborn but the production quality of the game makes up for it. It's feels GOOD.

You have multiple classes that have all their passives, active abilities but also their own perks that you chose by leveling up. You can be a hunter that becomes invisible and get different bonus when using his javelins to take down enemies or you can be an engineer that uses drones to help him destroys his foes or even a melee assassin.

Lots of weapons as well, from pistol, smg and shotguns to miniguns, mortar and bows. There is every type of weapons you can hope for. Weapons also have affixes to change their behaviour  (firerate, recoil, elemental damage, crit chance etc) 

The only mid element of the game I would say is the level design. More specifically  the lack of real variety. But Hades also had that and the game is still a masterpiece, so it's not a deal breaker at all in Roboquest, just something you notice quickly after several runs.

Overall it's a great experience, lots of variety in its gameplay, secrets to find, upgrades to get, builds to try and tons of enemies and bosses to kill.

After playing many runs of the 1.0.0 full launch of Roboquest, this has turned out to be one of the most addictive game out there of all time for a Roguelike shooter game. It is such an improvement compared to when it was in Early Access, lots to do. I Highly recommend Roboquest. The music is absolutely epic, there's new levels, there's NPC's etc. You simply must get this game, it's so good. I'll explain how to unlock the Ranger, buddy bot and Elementalist class in Roboquest...

SPOILER ALERT ON HOW TO UNLOCK THE RANGER, BUDDY BOT AND ELEMENTALIST CLASS:

RANGER CLASS: To unlock the Ranger, you must find the lost javelin in one of the levels. It is located in the Oasis level. When you are within the level, it is behind a waterfall on the orange colour of your mini map. Once you have claimed the lost javelin, you will automatically unlock the Ranger class.

BUDDY BOT: Now this one confused me to the point where I made a discussion on how to unlock the Buddy Bot. In the very first level, it is an enemy robot that has a different paint job than the rest and has a green eye for it's critical spot as a weakness. Do not kill him for that is the Buddy Bot you are looking for, simply run up to him and interact with it to permanently unlock it for future runs. Once you have unlocked the Buddy Bot, you will no longer encounter him.

ELEMENTALIST CLASS: This one is a tricky one, you need to do several runs and make it to the energy center. At the very start of the energy center, instead of starting your run right away, look behind you, you will notice a locked door with a code on it. To unlock this door, you must reach the first safe zone (green zones are safe zones on your mini map, checkpoints). You will notice that there is a locked door as you enter the safe zone to your left, stick to the left of that room, there is see through glass, through the glass is the very code you need to unlock the door to get the Elementalist class. However, this is the bad news, you will only see 2 of those numbers per run that change randomly each time. For example, my first run when I noticed it (NOTE: The code is completely different for each player but here is an example), X3X4XX, then on my 2nd run, 6XXX2X. You get the picture anyway. Keep restarting your run and get up to the energy center to eventually get your full 6 digit code to unlock the door to get the Elementalist. He is the most overpowered class in the game, it is totally worth doing.

The rest of getting everything in the game, spoiling the rest, I will not say, those 3 things are vital to know. The rest is up to you to discover. 

5/5

Fast paced roguelite shooter with a killer dynamic soundtrack by the talented Noiscream. Movement is great with a default slide and double jump and goomba stomping enemies is viable and satisfying.

The game is properly difficult now, forcing you to focus on position as well as the weapons you carry and your cooldowns as well as the game having tons of secrets and unlockables including 6 classes! My only gripe is the rooms that lock you in until you complete a ""boss"" of waves of enemies. The rooms can feel very clustery and can end up ruining what could be a good run.

Overall, the game is a blast and I find myself actually enjoying video games again. The concept is very simple but the game feels great to play and advance in. Each run has me wanting to push the earlier levels faster and the later levels further until the run reaches its summit.

5. Risk of Rain 2
4. RoboQuest 
3. Ziggurat 2
2. Crab Champions
1. Gunfire Reborn

This one is at #4, and could even rise higher.

Initially, I had enough fun playing this like a standard FPS: strafe, duck, shoot, reload. But after a few hours, I started getting into the more unique elements of the game, such as the Mario-inspired headbonk, the weapon swapping (your weapons automatically reload when not in your hand), and the rail-riding. Really, the game is meant to be played at a fast and chaotic pace, and once you get comfortable with it, it becomes downright addicting.

Most of my hours so far have been during early access, and I can say the official 1.0 release is nothing but improvements on an already solid, well-made game. 

In short, this is one of my all time favorites.

The guns feel like Borderlands meets Overwatch. The movement is fluid and the abilities grow in the exact direction you want them to. They also have actual impact.

Also, this isn't new, but most of the enemies are small balls flying and its like if Doom '16/Eternal enemy roster consisted of mostly lost souls, and if that doesn't sound fun to you, then this won't be for you.

If you enjoyed Doom Eternal and like Rogue-likes, this game is perfect for that itch. You can compare this game to a lot of things (gunfire reborn especially) but once you get the flow of it, it really feels like you're just culling robots, and that's peak. I played most of my hours in the Pre-release so my progress is all gone now (saj) but I am honestly enjoying the large amount of guns they added. A scout never felt so good. 

As for my issues, it's all small stuff. Like lack of levels and enemies. They are all robots sure, but most do the same thing. Like there is this really annoying turret that will chain you, pulling you to it... and then there is this small robot enemy who can chain you... pulling you to it... and there are only like 10 bosses on like 3 or 4 different boss waves. They added some super secret paths but those seem to be for end game builds, so I am not sure co-op pathing there will ever make sense. So, my route remains mostly the same since I started playing so my grind will be largely the same, which is disappointing. Also I have to find all the data logs again... kill me pls.

I really do recommend this game! I am just worried by how slow developments have been. I am not one that understands any of that or claims to, but having a title screen be a christmas theme for about a year is a bit much (pre-release). Like how can you tell a game is dead? It's christmas update is live during halloween 11 months later. I was aching for at least that to be changed in an update so it didn't feel like a dead game. That being said I held out hope, and the improvements made in the past year have been great, bar them making Max look wayyy weirder.

[list]
[*] This game has the most responsive, satisfying, and smoothest movement that's ever graced an FPS.
[*] Almost all weapons, abilities, perks, etc. fill out their own relatively distinct and entertaining niche.
[*] Builds may lack the Issac-style zaniness, but still perfectly manage to balance player agency, variety, and viability.
[*] Content is unlocked at a fairly consistent and satisfying pace, and the difficulty curve feels [i]just-right[/i].
[*] Multiplayer support is fantastic, even if its limited to two players, and doesn't feel like it's mandatory to progress.
[*] The art style is fantastic, was implemented really well, and always keeps the game state very clear.
[/list]

I do have a few complaints, but thankfully none of them are about the core game-play:
[list]
[*] Chapter 3 just isn't optimised properly, as looking towards the centre of the map can drop my frame-rate by up to 75%.
[*] Unreal's vague anti-aliasing settings are here with a vengeance, with higher values smearing Vaseline over my screen.
[*] Epic Online Services and Starbreeze are tied to this game, but everything seems incredibly smooth at launch.

(This is a complete change of my original review)

Until the full release, I have found myself with 80 hours more into the game and coming back into it, I would like to think that my progress I have made would be worth something. No. It's not. I probably had accumulated over 2k Wrenches, had all the upgrades, and I return to the game that just treated that like it didn't matter. I never had any of those issues with the EA builds, and could easily rebuy the base upgrades since it refunded me for my earlier buys. Evidently, 80 hours just went into the drain.

Pre 1.0

My only complaint is some minor issues with the online features. Sometimes there's a disconnect. Hasn't really screwed up any runs yet, but seems to happen after a run and the host tried to start a new run.

IT'S SO MUCH FREAKING FUN GO BUY THE GAME 
SLIDE JUMPING AND RAIL GRINDING GO WEEEE
HAVE YOU EVEN SEEN THAT YOU CAN ROCKET JUMP AND GRAPPLE
DO I NEED TO SAY MORE?

I'VE BOUGHT THIS GAME 5 TIMES. I'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS SINCE 2020.



*UPDATE 30-06-2022:*
Oh heck I'm back! I'm still playing, and the 0.9 playtest has me more hyped than ever before! With the removal of Weapon Categories and a complete visual overhaul for the perk screen. weapon drops and a large visual improvement too all environments since my last review update, this game just keeps getting better. This is by far the most play time I've put into a 16 euro game, and that 200 hour that I'm at right now will
The developers are still doing an amazing job :D



*UPDATE 29-01-2021:*
I feel like updating my review periodically (2-3 months), because the game probably has one of the most involved (and social) communities that I've ever been in. And I absolutely love it.

Let's start with stating the obvious: The game has some REAL potential. This is created by the insanely fine DOOM-esque gun-play, together with the great movement, even mid-air. 
Refined with the perk system, it really doesn't matter if you want to go insanely fast and guns blazing, or take it slow and methodically. Weapon affixes contribute to this as well, making it viable to sit back with snipers and not getting any of ""dem sweet cellz"" (XP) go to waste. (Snipers work a good deal in close quarters as well, because of nearly perfect hipfire accuracy!) 

The base system was greatly improved upon with both the Autumn and Winter 2020 updates. With the addition of more ways to spend your gears, earned by clearing zones and getting good ranks, it feels good to grind for the upgrades again. Al (Not that I really need to, I've got over 1100 spare gears as of writing, but ahhh it's just so fun to do and see that S rank xD)

Overall, if this update pace and patch size keeps up, together with the minor tweaks and bugfixes, this game WILL be good. The only minor criticism that there is, is the performance of a certain zone (called Fields), that gives substantial frame drops on the minimum spec. If you have anything above a GTX 660/750, you will likely not having any drops in frame rate.

Conclusion:
Keep up the amazing work, RyseUp. This is a gem which can only be polished further.



*Base review as of 25-8-2020*
So this is the kind of games you rarely find in Early Access or even as an indie title.
This, this is a hidden gem. The gameplay does remind me of Quake/Doom because it's you can choose to play INSANELY FAST and get rewarded with a sick S-rank at the end of a stage + gears for upgrading your hub-base. 
The base is a place where you upgrade your structures, this is where more content will be added in the future and is quite necessary as I already maxed everything out in 3 hours of time.
The gameplay loop of this game is just ""aaaaaaahhhhh it's so GOOD"". There is a random selection of guns that you start with, and get a core to upgrade your ability or buff your weapon(s). In every level there is a mini-dungeom where you can get more weapons and better cores!

For an early access title, I'm rating this a 9/10. I can't wait what more content will be added in the future, I am HYPED",1598364461,1699396108,True,8,0,0.585376143455505371,0,True,False,True

Personally, the game reminds me of Dead Cells of all games. The game is fast, and you’re encouraged to meet such expectations.  The better you get at a game, the more enjoyment you get from playing it. Levels are “semi”-random – they have pre-defined structure but random room composition. There’s a great emphasis on your tools of destruction - a ton of unique weapons with unique core features gimmicks, not just a number of “gun”-sticks with variable stats attached/

The game has a variety of classes. What exactly is the class? In fact, it’s your core abilities (“grenade” and “ultimate” kinda) and upgrade path - a set of bonuses you get for the run. Once again, unlike most rougeulites, they are not stat sticks and actually have a meaningful impact on how you play and what you choose to upgrade next, providing build variety even on the hardest difficulty.

I want to say a special thanks for a very fast metaprogression - it takes around 8-12 hours to unlock all content and enjoy the game at its full potential. It might look like a downside for some, but I'm really tired of worthless grind for 30 hours just to get a whooping +5% to crit my ass.

Never had a chance to play in multiplayer, so can’t say anything about it.

So, some downsides-controversies:

1. The levels are kinda samy as room diversecity is not that good, but the gameplay is so fast i wasn’t bothered by it in my 130 hours
2. (Not my point but  a complaint from a friend of mine) ”Not enough enemy variety” (mind you, he compares it to Ultrakill enemy variety). All your enemies are robots, flying robots and turrets. The only thing that changes is a pattern of attack (some shoot lasers, some shoot grenades, some go for melee, annoying you do death). Though one must admit bosses are unique and fun to fight against.

And that’s kinda it. You should buy it if you like to check your reflexes

Edit: forgot to mention how well made prefix system is. Prefixes are actually have impact on what this particular weapon can do

NOTE: I have A LOT more than 25 hours in game, mainly due to playing GoG versions.

Roboquest is a great feeling FPS shooter with some rougelike elements that keeps each run feeling fresh and a progressive unlock system that keeps you playing for hours.

Typical runs average around 20 minutes depending on how far you are in the game.

Graphics have a charming comic book aesthetic, and if the onomatopoeia annoys you, it can be turned off.

It runs really well on a variety of systems.

Transparent developers, vibrant community.

I participated in the pre-release 1.0 test and from what I was able to experience, which was very little, it fixed a lot of the issues I have with the current Early Access version.
Can't wait for 1.0 and to craft a full review.

All that being said, I went back and played an old/legacy version again recently (via GoG) and I must say I miss directly upgrading the basecamp, I ask the that the developers re-implement it going into the future, like maybe in 2.0.",1698201331,1698201331,True,1,0,0.502058684825897217,0,True,False,True

Jokes aside, this is a solid FPS entry outside of the rouge-like mechanics (which are very good in providing that incremental power creep and playtime goals to strive towards)

If you like the frenetic pace from DOOM 2016 and many ways to play a specific build, you'll absolutely love this game.

The progression systems feel good to work towards without taking too long to get to a strong state. As a Gunfire Reborn fanboy I think the replayability of Roboquest after maxing progress is a bit weaker due to a lack of variance in gameplay experience depending on weapon finds during a run and how those interact with your character selection and build. Finding cool weapons tends to just make you generally ""better"" instead of opening new ways to approach fights. 

Also the music goes incredibly hard.

Overall I would highly recommend the game. I thought the price was well justified in much earlier stages of the game and

The guns have the right amount of punch & there's a decent variety so far.
There's a decent amount of options (keybinds, fov, accessibility, etc.)
The visual style is charming & vibrant - I disabled the onomatopoeia (options, good!)
Sound could use a liiiittle bit more punch in certain things, but it's generally very good.
User feedback is surprisingly good. Music is excellet & very fitting.
There's one boss that's a bit of a stinker, but that can't keep me down.

If Gunfire Reborn is your shtick, you'll probably appreciate this.
Heck, I even think this is even better than Gunfire.

Hope the developement team keeps pouring content & features into this game.",1663531114,1693862982,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

When you start you'll feel that is not much but once you get into it, it gets sooooooo much better. Fast-paced, dynamic combat, huge variety of weapons, the feel of the game is amazing and most important of all...it's FUN as hell, which is one of the most important points a lot of AAA companies don't pay attention to these days. In such an overpopulated market of triple A games is good to find gems like this. I cannot recommend this game enough if you are looking for a FUN experience to spend some time on without the worry to lose track of story or anything else. Games should be like this (from my point of view); get in, play a game, have fun, get out. This game manages to do this perfectly. Only downside is that I cannot play multiplayer since it seems there are not many players online? Or something is wrong with quick-play, don't know. But still, singleplayer is excellent enough.

PS : If you are one of the developers reading this, please...UPGRADE THE UZIS!! They are quite bad, and I would like to kick some ass with those.

The good:
Best moment-to-moment pew-pew gameplay I've experienced outside of the Doom reboots. Smooth as silk and zone-inducing. And the guns feel great to shoot.
The music is an awesome mix of synthwave and drum n' bass. Pulse-pounding and despite the limited selection of tracks, they never got old.
The aesthetic is cheerful without being too goofy.
Difficulty is perfectly reasonable. I only got to the final boss once in almost 40 hours (on Normal difficulty), but I never felt like I'd been robbed. There are lots of opportunities to switch out and level up in different ways during the course of a run.
I loved the different robots, but once I unlocked the drone-keeper guy, he was my go to.

The meh:
I still don't understand what that little Robo-buddy is good for that you rather early on get access to in the starting area. It never once came in handy and was so big it kind of got in the way.
The story and cut scenes are ok, but really just a step-above placeholders.
Why on earth is it called Roboquest?  Despite it being a dumb name (imho), there's not a whole lot of ""quest"" involved.
After the first purple bonus area, I never felt compelled to hit up any others, as the risk vs. reward ratio never warranted it. Some better rewards in those areas might have been tempted me more often.

The verdict:
I love this game. I maxed out my skill tree in 40 hours on Normal difficulty, and I will definitely reinstall it once the game gets an official, polished release.  When this goes on sale, it's a very easy recommendation, even for those of you (like myself) who felt that their twitch-gaming days were behind them.",1693483263,1693483331,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First of all, the positives: the gameplay is really fun. I plays a lot like Doom Eternal with Borderlands elements, but in some surprisingly good procedurally generated levels that have a lot of verticality.
I think this is the only game that I have played so far that does rocket-jumping like this. I always take an explosive type weapon with me just for the extra mobility.

And the best part of the game for me, is the soundtrack. Noisecream did a fantastic job here.

And the arsenal is pretty decent. But I think some guns are a bit weak.
Some weapons, like the Blast SMG, Blast Rifle and the Bubble Splasher feel weak to use.

I don't have a lot of things that I dislike about the game. Most of it boils down to early access balancing problems.
[list]
[*]Like the Recon being a lot more powerful than the other classes to the point where you can just use the laser cutlass and ignore your guns. Although it is fun, I would like for the guns to be stronger to counterbalance the cutlass.
[*]And the Engineer not being very fun to play, since his turrets have a tendency to either die before they get useful, or they just kill everything for you until the late game, where they become useless again. Though, this might just be me not preferring the Engineer's play-style, since I don't have many suggestions for him.
[/list]

And the game needs a lot more content. I hope they add it before it releases. Because the game right now is a well built scaffold with a lot of potential for a good game.

And another issue people have been having with this game, high CPU temps. I thought it was  an issue with Proton at first, but it seems like it's still a problem.

theres alot of guns but most feel pretty bad and if you find a good one it wont last long because scaling

for a roguelike game there was very little perk/weapon/unlock synergy so you wont be getting that power fantasy or feeling of getting stronger. 

theres an enemy type which endlessly spawns enemies and with the games verticality and layout finding them is a bit shit because they seem to continue spawning even if you go around a corner to the next set of enemies. 

every section has so much vertical space just to hide a few little unlocks and then theyre empty and you just feel like your missing something obvious unless the only point is to be able to skip entire encounters at a time which seems counter intuitive since at the end of runs you get rewards based on your xp gained and time spent

the movement options feel pretty pointless since most things are dodged by just strafing and or jumping in one direction around any enemy that takes more than 3 shots

I enjoy the game play loop and like the different parkour segments; further into that the movement feels great however there are a couple a things that feel a little buggy while playing but as we are in Early access that's to be expected but still it feels fluid the majority of the time. P.S the remainder is just a rant of one of the playable characters in the game(spoiler) if your wanting to just find out if the game is worth it. Absolutely. 

The characters are all unique and I quite enjoy their abilities and the upgrades that flow with them but if there was one character that gets on my nerves is engineer. He almost feels underwhelming and for being the last character that most people will unlock I expected more out of him. His drones can be buggy and there are times when they don't seem to do anything at all which sucks because it's upgrades are amazing. I love the Idea of this focused fire type build where the drones burn down big enemies with you. Sadly, I find myself annoyed because sometimes the drones sit back behind cover and other times they just don't shoot at all. Even after acquiring the perks that dictate the drones actions so to speak. I just wish the drones were a little more proactive at times and require less on where I position myself and lean more into where I can position them. This is just a opinion though I've had friends who like the Engineer but to me it feels to much like the guardian(starting character) with drones instead of a shield in the beginning.",1692165684,1692165684,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm not even sure if it's something fixable, ***for us***, sadly. To preface, this is coming from the perspective of myself and my buddy who are both around a low-plat level of skill for most competitive shooters we play. Not amazing by any means, but we're halfway decent shooter players.


TL;DR - It's got solid rogue-lite bones but the balancing is just not good enough, and is far enough off I'll take a pass from now and play Gunfire Reborn instead. Multiplayer works solid, if that's a concern.


The big reason I say for us specifically is I understand this bit is heavily opinionated -- The game is *too* hard at it's current state, but I think it'd take an entire redesign to make it work. The easy difficulty is too easy, the enemies hardly engage you by the time you've killed them. But the medium/default difficulty it feels like you're constantly chasing health globes, having to dive well past enemies to even make an attempt to survive because there's so many mobs around, and each hit is doing ~20% of your health or more. In enough rooms, you just simply do not have the amount of cover required to dodge the 15-20 enemies shooting at you at once.

I'd like to see the entire game rebalanced - Less damage from mobs, but harder to heal yourself. I don't want to feel like taking a couple hits has just completely ruined a run. I jump on to play a rogue-lite game to play casually, not sweaty, and that's how I've felt playing this.

There's other smaller issues, like a bug that the devs know about but has been incredibly difficult to track down. Sometimes  when I click to shoot, the gun just doesn't shoot. My buddy is not having the issue. That one is incredibly frustrating, and I hope they can track it down to fix. We've found the guns to be a bit boring just because since it's so difficult to dodge so much, feel like we have to have a medium range weapon at all times. Can't just nab a melee weapon or a flamethrower etc because we've just kinda died with em. But then, the power curve seems to jump significantly on the mobs. One section we're doing reasonable damage, the next, if we haven't had a chance to upgrade the weapon, feels like a wet noodle. The jumps are too big. Not to mention, as some other reviews have mentioned, the bosses often just feel like unneeded bullet sponges.

The base-level skill tree that you level feels medium-level impactful, mostly focusing on giving you more gun drops and chances they'll be upgraded with things like an alt-fire (maybe it'll be a zoom, or a charged shot, whatever). The multiplayer works well, had no issues. I wish there was more chances to grab some of the in-run card upgrades, something should come out of the vaults except for a weapon which basically never feels impactful.

The game is, at it's core, a traditional rogue-lite, and I do like it for that. But honestly? I'd rather just play Gunfire Reborn if I want a shooter rogue-lite, this doesn't bring anything new to my desires to play. We'll keep looking for others to try out and revisit this in a year or so and see what they've done with it.",1692114087,1692114200,False,5,1,0.477956175804138184,0,True,False,True

With that said, I can very confidently say that with the current state of things that Roboquest is very confidently shaping up to potentially become one of my favourite games this year with very little competition against it. This game thus far, even in its Early Access state very much feels like a labour of love from the dev team with a refreshing player-first mindset behind each of the current development decisions. Every aspect of the game from the gunplay to the movement to the varying class abilities to (most) enemy designs feel absolutely flawless. There's enough weapon variety at the time of writing this to benefit more or less any type of play style you may want to explore; even up to and including close range melee options such as chainsaws or exploding fists. 
My only real complaint with the current weapons would be that LMG type weapons feel VERY bad to use as they tend to slow you down while firing without doing enough damage to accommodate for the need to burst fire them, dodge, burst fire and then spend around two to three seconds reloading them.

Level design for the first six hours has been relatively pleasant to work through with the environments themselves being very pleasing to look at, if a little bit samey after enough back-to-back subsequent playthroughs, but if you don't no-life the game like I have over the past 24 hours then that may very well end up being a non-issue!

On the topic of classes, I truthfully can't comment all too much because I came into this game wanting to try out all of them only to end up falling in love with the Recon on account of its extremely satisfying fast-paced gameplay loop of teleporting into a group of enemies, stunning them, delivering quick and decisive (also very powerful) melee attacks to high-risk enemies and then using the fluid movement system to dodge the attacks of the recovering and surrounding enemies. It creates a very Doom-like method of play which compliments the necessity to kill enemies to regenerate any health and the bonuses to that health gain you get from using melee to kill enemies. Hell, six hours in I still haven't even unlocked the current final class of the game which only leaves me wondering how capable they are...

Not that they'll ever replace my beloved Recon if they don't have anywhere near as intoxicatingly smooth movement.

Anyway, mindless rambling aside -
 If you aren't a broke BITCH and like fast-paced, highly promising FPS roguelikes and are willing to place a little bit of faith in some devs who so far have only shown promise and love for their game? I sincerely could not recommend Roboquest enough. We're looking at 1.0 releasing at latest by the end of September hopefully, which leaves plenty of time to get into the game, familarize yourself with the systems, get your camp upgraded and your robots unlocked in preparation for the huge patch that's coming soon.

What's there that is good:
-cool classes
-satisfying challenge
-exploration of levels encouraged
-interesting boss fights
-enemy variety
-gunplay good
-meta-prog matters

No real complaints from an early access perspective. 

Things I'd like more of/like to see:
-areas, arenas, locations 
simply put, what;s there is great, more would be better
-bigger basecamp
a DRG-style basecamp is the standard imo, this comes close, but could be exceeded wildly if there were meta-progression installations that do certain things during runs. there's some of that in a skill tree but imo its massively advantaged if you ""see"" the upgrades. if the camp got more visually interesting as you built it, it would make the game perfect. maybe add friendly robots to find throughout the levels that can be added to your base, even if they are just cosmetic. make it modular possibly and it adds to the replayability.
-game modes
the wave rooms are cool, so maybe a mode where each room-clear gets bigger/harder, and goes infinite for certain kinds of rewards? maybe specially-designed arenas for wave modes? buttons or other interactables that change the areas? king of the hill in certain areas?

It is one thing to say you made the game for the hardcore base but sadly that is not the core of any game in this era. You have to make it friendly for newer players otherwise you have an abysmal player base. The game has good fundamentals but that quickly is overshadowed by the simple issues that one would think would be simple to adjust... But with it being almost 3 years since releasing in early access it is doubtful they will make the changes.

Pros:
-Weapons feel amazing, are varied and fun to use.
-Graphics are clean and crisp, very good art style.
-Controls are customizable.
-Jumping into Coop isn't difficult.
-Classes when unlocked feel different and not clones of each other.


Cons:
-The trailer is misleading on how the gameplay is not the same. 
-For a bulleth@ll type of game their push for you to melee doesn't make sense.
-Health orbs heal sparingly, for only a few points, less than 10hp. Orbs also have a short time limit.
-The ramp up is non existent, you will walk into ANY room(that goes for the 1st room as well) and mobs are spawned and pointed at the door.
-Melee is pointless and makes no sense.
-There are rails, for sliding, added to the game that have no point whatsoever, they either traverse you 10 feet or they are used specifically for a certain mob.
-You can trigger mobs from another section of the map and there is no indicator as to what triggered it. Ex: Was in a menu after clearing a room and suddenly got attacked. Where did they come from? From the next section that wasn't walked into... 
-After you beat the first boss there is a rest room but has the healing locked off... How do you unlock it? Who knows the game doesn't tell you anything. 
-Other than to challenge yourself there is no real reason to change from the first class(invincibility shield) you start with. Not because it is good but because it can block all the bullets you are about to walk into once you step out the base room.


It is weird to say that the game has potential when it's been almost 3 years and they are about to fully release the game and some of these issues more than likely won't be fixed. Unless the point of the game is to just have a small number of people play and that's it than I guess. 

Even from Steamcharts the game had a peak of 800 players and now average of 200 daily. It's just not inviting for new players that would love to invest their money in indie games.

Scaling is way off, take 0 damage until ""fields"" where enemies then start locking on and movement doesn't seem to matter. 

Very, very little build choice.  Only 5 classes of which 4 I currently have, and they're slightly different but not really.  

You barely get upgrades ingame so it's hard to feel a ""build"" come together. Ther are a few weapons to choose from, which is my next point.

Weapon balance is horridly off, there are level 1 weapons that outdps green lvl 6's.  There also seems to be massive damage falloff on many weapons making them completely useless, as their dps is not at all enough to justify the range.

The levels feel super cramped, which is generally a problem in the genre.

Really good! My experience of this game in terms of games I've played is: You're Scout from TF2 (with Apex Legends slide hopping but in every direction all the time) in Binding of Isaac... with Dark Souls enemies... and a Dota 2 sized kit of abilities...

Like Scout from TF2, you move fast and hit hard and hate getting hit. Like Binding of Isaac, the run is different every time and you sometimes get wacky combinations of properties (albeit nowhere near as wacky as BOI's). Like Dark Souls, you really need to pay attention to enemy attacks in a specific and focused way instead of just mindlessly kiting. And like Dota 2, you have a large bag of meaningful tricks (2-3 guns, each potentially with an alt-fire, and 2 abilities) and it's a big challenge trying to remember all of them and find good opportunities to use each one.

Also depending on your weapons you'll tend to feel a bit like either Scout, Soldier, or Sniper from TF2 (or Tracer from Overwatch, or Genji from Overwatch...)

I'm pretty sure it's a lot like Ultrakill but I haven't gotten around to playing Ultrakill.

It's hard! And fast-paced. And has two player online co-op which I haven't tried yet.

Also the music is pretty good, very cyberpunky.

The visuals are a little bit of a weak point, being kind of like Borderlands but with a blander personality (not that I like Borderlands's personality). I appreciate the very tame wholesomeness of them, though, and they're visually clean and gameplay-oriented and I appreciate that too.

I haven't made it to the end of the content that's in the game, and there's a really major 1.0.0 release update coming in Q3 2023 that based on the dev blogs is really something to look forward to, but the current state of the game is already very fun and extremely gameplay focused in a great way.",1685640133,1686093793,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

-Weapon balance: some weapons feel bad to use AND have bad dmg/fire rate
-Lack of mantling: the map design makes it seem like mantling would totally work… but there is no mantling/climbing component 
-Multiplayer: can’t see your teammates’ name or outline through walls
-Health cells: I understand why they disappear quickly, but I don’t like how it forces you to rush in to collect them… ESPECIALLY when running a class and/or weapon(s) that work best at range…
-I wish you could drag and drop items / move them in your inventory

Roboquest is the first game I have ever written a review on! This speaks volumes to me as a gamer who typically is silent in his opinions and grumbles with no outlet other than the echo chamber he exists in on discord. Back on topic!

The first thing that caught my eye while browsing for another rogue-like was its visuals. It's like if Borderlands and your favorite comic book had a baby, and then that baby over-ran the human race and started killing off all the fleshies. I wish more games used cell-shading! The next hook were the noise pop-ups on every gun that you use; the snippets in the vids and screenshots don't do it justice. There is no other way to convey the experience of leaning over your keyboard, FOV at 130, playing the video-game equivalent of Adderall, while constantly moving, swapping out between weapons, and seeing each one go ""KAPOW"" ""BOOmF"" ""PEWPEW"".  Lastly, the color coding of objectives are another small, yet important thing for me visual wise. Countless times I can yell ""Purple"" to indicate the platforming puzzle, or ""orange!"" to indicate the secret rootin tootin loot hidden behind a waterfall or coded door. 

The visuals, while great, are not enough for someone to stay around. RyseUp distilled the most addicting part of roguelike's as a whole and infused it into their weapons, tiered progression system, and in-run level up perks. After you acquire the metal-detector gadget/trinket the game morphs into a collection fueled frenzy. Every room or sector I clear is another chance to find another addicting gun to use before I find another one that has just a tad more crit modifier or just a little more damage or-- A MISSILE GATLING WITH CRYO DAMAGE, ALT FIRE, +20% RELOAD SPEED, AND HAS A 15% CHANCE TO LAUNCH A LASER ARC EVERY SHOT FIRED. After you finish a run, or get far enough into a run with nice weapon affixes and die to the robot ninja sneaking up on you or the floor trap robit you forgot to clear, you get access wrenches. Wrenches are used to upgrade your ""camp"" so to speak which modify your passive abilities. Its nice to see abilities that directly increase the chance to find rarer guns and those that increase passive stats for your robot as well. I am 13 hours in so far and am more than halfway done with the progression tree. Finally, the in-run/in-game perks that you get make each run THAT much more fun to play. Just today I ran a session where I spec'd fully into Cryo damage; my drones did cryo damage, all my weapons by default did cryo, enemies received crit damage once frozen, AND Cryo damage was increased to enemies with resistance to it. 

That is just one of the dozens of perk combinations you can obtain ( my faves are fire drones, cryo and more explosive explosions) while progressing through a run as the final class you can unlock. 

I also haven't even mentioned the different classes, difficulty modifiers, the MUSIC ( the music <3 ), rail surfing, the goofy ah boss fights, the fact that it is COOP, and the overall polish these devs have put into this game. Robotquest is the epitome of what happens when a developer loves what they are working on. Studios that are not controlled or owned by the dollar of some mogul can produce truly great work. I am willing to wait as long as possible for a 1.0 release of this game and will have fun every moment I spend playing it before that happens.

Thank you for reading! I wish you luck on your RoboQuest!",1683949224,1683949224,True,2,0,0.51754385232925415,0,True,False,True

TL;DR
[i]Game will seriously push your CPU temps. Be wary if you purchase.[/i]

Edit: I have reinstalled Windows and games still stutter. Leads me to believe it's a hardware issue. Stay away from this game until it's fixed.

Right now I'm under the impression it did so to mine. Before I get to the context, you can even look in the discussions to see other people reporting really high temps (some legit, some not, although safe temps do vary a lot depending on CPU) and the devs acknowledging the issue, not denying it's because of the game. My experience while reading these posts is that most of the CPUs listed are Ryzen 5000 series. Maybe my reading experience was skewed though.

So I started playing this game again recently. I also opened CSGO about the same time for the first time in a while. I noticed some stuttering in CSGO and tried a ton of solutions I found online, none of which were working, which is weird because I didn't have these problems before. Also, my hardware specs include a Ryzen 5900x and RTX 3080. Not potato hardware. 

Ever since then, I noticed it also happening in Roboquest and Vermintide 2 consistently (they're the only games I've really been playing lately). I tried rolling back drivers thinking it happened because I updated the drivers during the CSGO shenanigans, among other things. So then I reverted everything I changed during the CSGO fix-attempt. Still nothing.

Downloaded HWInfo hoping to find something that stuck out of place. When running Roboquest, my CPU temps were around 87/88C. And the game had barely been running at that point, barely into a run. Even main menu temps were in the 80s. I assumed this was a cpu issue though, not the game. So I opened up my PC intending to re-apply thermal paste when I noticed the radiator and fans there were quite dusty. Figured it was worth a shot de-dusting and hoping that was enough without having to re-apply thermal paste. 

First opened Vermintide 2 (very cpu-heavy game). Stuttering still existed. But this was my first time checking temps for it. It was sitting in the 60s for a while before going into the 70s. Perfectly acceptable. Opened Roboquest. Temps were nearly as high as before, maybe a couple of degrees lower. I remember seeing 85C quickly into testing. I decided to re-apply thermal paste anyway. No difference.

I've exhausted all solutions I could think of. Only thing that makes sense in my mind for what's going on is that Roboquest initially pushed my CPU temps really high, near shut-down status, during my long sessions, overheating it just enough that something inside isn't working up-to-snuff. If the game isn't to fault, there's been some crazy coincidences along the way. Either way, a game shouldn't be raising temps this much higher than other games, especially when it's CPU usage is a lot less.

I would love to recommend this game because the movement and shooting is actually phenomenal (could use some more content for longevity though (hoping 1.0 brings this)). But people are experiencing dangerous temps on their CPU and this should have been a priority a year ago when these reports were coming in, maybe sooner.",1680932783,1682408911,False,1,3,0.435728162527084351,0,True,False,True
