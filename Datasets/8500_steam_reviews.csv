I started off on some agent missions to begin with, while paying for an Omega starter pack. It was okay; good graphics and fun play, amazing UI, with a gentle introduction to the game mechanics. There are many different paths a player can choose that might suit their personality or play style. The game play is immersive and the game itself is expansive and all consuming that might make you wonder if you can make an alternative life in this futuristic simulation.

However, it fell apart for me when I learned the game is incredibly expensive for multi-month or multi-year play and when it came time to look at an Omega subscription I couldn't justify it. Meanwhile, somewhere inside I was wondering if grinding missions was what I really wanted to be doing in a subscription based game; probably a result of playing for only 10 days.

Free Play; I don't think it's worth doing it, there are too many restrictions in free play; where and what you can fly, your skill level and skill learn rates for example.

So I've ended up not subscribing and no longer excited to play perhaps without discovering some of the other aspects of this game like major battles, alliances and PvP.",1708295712,1708295712,False,1,0,0.475328922271728516,0,True,False,False

Generally, I'm not inclined to write reviews as I consider them a waste of time. However, in this case, I find it more worthwhile to invest time in writing this review than continuing to play the game.

This game presents a steep learning curve and proves even more challenging to master. The pay-to-win aspect adds an additional layer of frustration, as the ability to purchase PLEX tokens with real money and convert them into substantial in-game currency (ISK) disrupts the traditional progression of earning currency through activities like mining and manufacturing.

For instance, a PLEX, which can be acquired for as little as $0.05, can be sold in-game for 5 million ISK. If a new player decides to engage in mining activities in the relatively safer High Sec systems, they may only earn around 5 million ISK per hour. This stark contrast raises the question of why one should spend an hour engaging in labor-intensive tasks when the same value can be obtained through a 0,05$ investment in PLEX.

While this dynamic may benefit the game's publisher financially, it significantly diminishes the intrinsic value of in-game achievements, making it disheartening to realize that an hour of dedicated gameplay translates to a mere $0.05 in real-world value. 

If you're enthusiastic about playing this game for its [b] MINING and MANUFACTURING [/b] features, think twice if you value your real-life time. Manufacturing often proves to be less profitable than mining, with selling raw ores often yielding more significant profits. Consider this before investing your time in these aspects of the game.

Another significant issue with this game is the prevalence of [b] multiboxing, [/b] where a single player controls multiple in-game characters. This creates an inherent disadvantage for solo players, as multiboxers often form mining or ratting fleets, allowing them to generate more in-game currency (ISK) than those with solo accounts. This imbalance can impact the overall gaming experience, putting individual players at a disadvantage against these multiboxing fleets.

An additional concern worth noting is the issue of warp scrambling. This occurs when a player disrupts your warp system, leaving you stranded with little recourse for escape, especially challenging for newer players. It becomes disheartening to see your hard-earned in-game currency, accumulated through hours of effort, become the source of joy for someone else. 

While experienced players might suggest using the directional scanner to avoid potential threats, constantly monitoring it while trying to engage in activities like mining or exploration can be tedious and detract from the overall gaming experience. Believe me it is pretty boring to watch your d-scanner every 5 seconds after few mining runs. If you enjoy a game where constant vigilance against potential ganks is a central aspect, then this game might be the perfect fit for you. However, be prepared to witness your efforts—representing hours of gameplay and potentially even real money—dissipate as your hard-earned ship, valued at 0,50$, is blown away in an instant. 

Good Luck Capsuleers! Enjoy Your Time in New Eden!

The good:
it looks nice providing you have the hardware for it. Exploration, as in exploring space (not the profession) is exciting as you never know what/who you are going to find in the next system.
Unlocking the next ship/skill feels rewarding at lower SP(levels) because it opens up a lot options.
The market is awesome
There are some really nice groups out there once you take the time to get to know them.

The bad
This isn't the kind of game were you can just walk away from the computer at any time you feel like. There is less freedom to go make a cuppa, or deal with a family issue if you are say mid fleet, or in the middle of a jump between 0.0 and highsec.
PVP for newer players can feel very one sided sometimes
Established players will always have the upper hand, be it money wise, or SP, or that lucrative BPO you would kill to get your hands on.

From the bustling trade hubs to the lawless null-sec regions, every corner of the universe presents opportunities and challenges.

[h2]Player-Driven Economy: 💰📈[/h2]
At the heart of EVE Online is its player-driven economy. The game operates on a single server, creating a shared marketplace where every ship, module, and resource is crafted and traded by players. The intricate economic web reflects the consequences of player actions, creating a dynamic and responsive virtual economy.

[h2]Political Intrigue and Alliances: 🤝🌌[/h2]

This is one of the few of the genre left  that rewards patience, determination, knowledge and skill over just showing up, paying your money and having a brain stem. You won't find your typical WoW player here; they couldn't hack it.  The learning curve is steep - expect lots of reading and figuring out technical operations of your ship and the player-driven economy - but it's well worth it. 


Beautiful game, very well done, with an interesting back story. 

The player versus  player is brutal and no one will help you other than the local Security forces if you get in a fight - and if you start one in the wrong sector, they'll finish it. . Overall I can't recommend this game more.

EVE: One of the few MMO to not go full welfare and to continue to be challenging, innovative and expansive. 

Anyone can play. All you have to do is be ready to learn, have patience and be interested. Make sure you  bookmark some of the suggested resources from the Community section. You will need all the help you can get - but that is what makes it so very rewarding to play. 

[b] One last thing: Ignore the messages in the local chat about 1 million free ISK for clicking a link. You can do that yourself, with a second FREE account and have both get the rewards. If you do it through an ingame link, the spammer whose link you click will get rewards every time you do anything involving real money. You can get those rewards yourself simply by making a second free account from the EVE site (dont do it through Steam  - they will be connected and it wont work), and giving yourself the referral.[/b] 

Good luck, capsuleer! 

10/10 - the only game I have ever rated as perfect.

That said, if you connect with the right people a new player can be in a fleet action in their first week.

To get the most out of EVE, find a helpful corp with lots of support policies and training. Don't worry about what ship you can fly or making ISK. Learn the game, learn how to survive, learn how to pilot a ship in PVP. The ISK will come and the blingy ships will follow.

First of all, for a new player, EVE is like a job, you have to spend considerable amount of time to get better.

Second, the game is absolutely not solo friendly, you have to join a group to actually survive and do something. I'm not even talking about nullsec or lowsec stuff, just trading has so many risks if you are doing it alone.

Third, the game's economy evolves around big groups. With small groups, you cannot make decent amount of money unless you are extremely lucky or have so much time to spare. You have to join big groups with mandatory stuff forced on you.

Fourth, the community isn't the best. I joined big groups, small groups, teamed up with other solos and such. Nobody is looking you as a partner. Noone trusts each other. That's why no-moderation MMOs don't exist anymore. You are nothing but a disposable asset to any group.

Fifth, subscription price is too much. This goes to both real money and ISK. And unless you are a 15-year veteran who leads a big group or you are a person who spends 8+ hours on EVE every day, otherwise you won't be able to afford Omega with ISK at all.

Sixth, PvP is absolutely garbage. Personal skill definitely matters, but you know what matters more? Your ship and number of your friends. Not only that, PvP griefers exits. People who instakills you without any gains on their end. They just want to ruin your day. People who can't achieve anything in their lives are in this game griefing to please themselves.

A shame, the concept is really cool. The first years people were helpful, uniting against something, working together. Now it's all ""I want more, you need less"" garbage.",1405723724,1701796388,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

Whoever complains about veterans having a huge advantage because of skill points and that people are multiboxing should just live their life outside of eve and experience the same thing. I can understand that real life + real life simulation can be too much, if that's the case for you then just walk away.

If you are a super newbro, just look up some videos on youtube about your options (the game tutorial got a lot better too) and precisely train into them. The biggest error done by a newbro is just aimlessly training into different skills without a purpose. Get a purpose, get a goal and a ~20-30 million skill pointed character can be on the same level as a 500 million skill pointed charater regarding that one-two thing you want to do super effectively.

Who says its pay for win should take this into consideration: Ofc you can get more skillpoints faster, but that's just the same thing like in RL, you spend money to get faster to your destination with a bus.. a car.. a plane.. or 10 shots of vodka and you just teleport (cheapest btw). Everything depends how you look at life. Do you want to wait 1 month for something  IRL time or do you want to work for 1 hour IRL and be done with it? Like I said this is a life simulator with lasers and sci-fi settings and a lot of pew-pew-pew-KABLAMMM-SCHOOOOO-ZZZZAAAAARRRGHHHH-BLEEARRGH. Usually people play this game to express their urges they can't do IRL (blow shit up, scam people, etc).

So take it for what it is. If you don't want another life simulation (what could have been if I would been nice or bad) then just live your real life, go home to your wife / husband / cat / dog, give them a kiss and tell them I'm glad I have time for you because I don't play EvE Online <3",1698453920,1701548618,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Those epic tales you read are EVE’s highlight reel, and each memorable moment you might be a part of will be separated by long periods of patient preparation.

When it was first released back in 2003, EVE was a largely empty universe with a smattering of players all trying to grab power and smash each other’s heads in with it. Over the years, it has grown into a complex sandbox with a wide variety of roles and activities to suit different people. Players who enjoy PvP can become pirates or fight for one of the empire faction’s militias, spending their days playing games of cat and mouse with other players through the low-security areas of the galaxy.

Combat in EVE is so high-stakes that new players frequently experience physical shaking (Myself Included). However, it’s worth noting that there is no traditional grinding in the game (so to speak). The real hurdle in this game is not how long you’ve spent grinding (training over Realtime), and how much information and support you have access to.

As a player with over 20 years of experience, I have seen the game evolve and change over time. I've been part of the incredible stories that punctuate the more sedated space simulation. I have experienced high-stakes combat and navigated the complex sandbox of roles and activities the Eve Online Provides. My overall experience has been rich and varied, shaped by the choices i have made and the paths i chose to follow.

However, some players have expressed concerns about the game. For instance, one player described it as the most unethical game they have ever played, despite the cool aspects around exploration. Another player mentioned that he could play this game for years before you really started to feel like you might have seen everything it had to offer.

In conclusion, EVE Online offers a unique and immersive experience that stands the test of time. 

It’s a game that rewards patience, strategy, and engagement. However, it’s not without its challenges and controversies.

When the box says community-driven, this time it actually means it. If you intend to accomplish anything in this game by yourself, you can spin 360 degrees right around and moonwalk away as fast as you can. The devs have no respect for any prospective solo activity in EVE and as a result every one of them has by now been reduced to mind-breaking tedium or are financially pointless. 

The game is a fascinating experiment in what a zero-trust society looks like. You cannot trust anyone in this game. Yet you cannot accomplish anything on your own. Everything that isn't an NPC in the game is a threat. You do not want to be on the same grid with another player you do not know. The difference between PvE and PvP combat is set up so that ships fit for most PvE activities are almost helpless if attacked by a PvP ship. NPC police will not and cannot protect you, as it is easy to instantly destroy your ship before they can intervene, which makes flying an expensive ship a risk anywhere at any time. Practically all public player contracts are scams. Joining small corps for that comfy nerd barrel fire in the wilderness is all fun and games until larger PvP corps start declaring war on you so they can attack you anywhere and they can do so indefinitely.

If you wish for PvP, do not get too hopeful as the killmail-system implemented in the game in its early years means even the hardened PvP veterans in EVE are extremely loss-averse. Every kill and loss is recorded in great detail. Nobody wants to go on record losing an expensive ship. No corp wants to lose a fleet they will have to replace. Nobody wants to lose their shiny implants. Nobody wants to fight unless they are 120% certain of winning. When you duel someone on a lowsec orbit, you can bet there are five guys aligned at you right outside of the grid waiting for your opponent to start hitting low armor. You'll spend three hours of fruitlessly scanning for targets for your roam fleet to finally get a bead on a singly unsuspecting frigate only for the fleet commander to refuse to warp in his 30 ships armed to the teeth because of the tiny off chance it was a trap. You'll spend hours being a redshirt on a roam fleet called to assemble at 11:30pm your time that warps around aimlessly and whenever finding the enemy roam fleet it runs back to the nearest station, unless the enemy fleet has 1/3rd of the numbers, in which case the opposite will happen, and you'll sit around a station slinging insults on chat for a few hours before everyone gets bored and goes home. Don't get me started on the POS bashes. You'll corp will eventually collapse when someone in the management decided to jump ship and steal everything with him to get on a le hecking epic reddit thread.

The devs have been trying to add more activities in the Empire (NPC-policed) space which is commendable, because not everybody wants to be a redshirt in the personal army of some internet tough guy running a nullsec-alliance. But as the focus is small fleet content, you'll be another little buzzard on the wall watching the e-extroverts having their fun.

Some of the UI cannot even fit on the screen without shrinking the UI scale down so you need to squint to read the text.

You get constantly mailed and messaged about registering to get free skill points because the game doesnt know how to retain players, and also constant messages of joining a corp and they all ask you to do PVP for their cause of building a structure aswell as move to a low security zone almost instantly while being brand new to the game.

Though the player base may have dropped since just a few years ago, the community remains as strong as ever and continue to generate great content in and outside the confines of the game. Myths of Eve being a place where everyone is hostile or toxic is simply NOT TRUE. Having played many MMOs I can say Eve is the most tight knit, loving, kind and helpful community out there (games or otherwise). 

As for development, CCP continues to release regular patches and quarterly expansions, faction warfare has been a focus of these lately. Scarcity has been mostly undone, and the CSM continues to work with CCP for changes the player community want in the game.

The tutorial and new player experience has been overhauled with career paths and achievements which give rewards such as skill points and ships. The game does still have a huge learning curve and you will need to stick with it, watch videos, read information, find a corp and people who can help you do what it is you like to do.

For people wanting to know if they should return, I think now is one of the best times ever to return. After my  latest 3 year break I am enjoying the game more than ever before and have stuck at it much longer, investing in multiple accounts and achieving my goals while having a fun time.

I wanted to take the time to read some of the other reviews to see why it was mixed and most what I found was people saying 20$ is to expensive. I'm not sure on the currency conversion, but in the US you can't do anything for entertainment for 20$. So people saying this is to much are living in a land of make belief. It could be they are so absorbed into a digital world, they haven't been outside and are totally devoid of real life.

EVE is well worth 20$ a month. If you can't see that you're totally delusional and you're playing way to much.

EVE is a massive universe, I started with the Amarr and played around in high sec for 6 months. BTW, in high sec I was never ganked once. Not a single time, so the people saying this is common is another lie. I spent 6 months never happened once. I was killed some in low-sec when I was mining. I was brand new, so I really had no idea what was going on anyways. 

I eventually joined Goonswarm in the null block and have had nothing but a great experience with them. Now I'm flying in fleets and supporting the battleships with my vigil just highlighting targets. 

EVE is a community game, can you play solo? Yes, will it be as fun, I doubt it. 

I have some negative opinions on EVE as well, for 1 I think the attribute system is just not good. Either needs a massive rework, or be removed. I don't think it benefits the game, or new players or player retntion. The skill system I'm also a bit indifferent about. I think some skills take way to long to train, but if you removed it then the progress feeling might feel empty. I think it needs review, and maybe rework some of the times. 

Lastly, I do think EVE encourages multiboxing and I think that has some drawbacks. Gate camps are almost impossible to see without a scout pilot. You can't login an alpha with an omega, so now you're forced to pay for 2 accounts. CCP I think needs to review this design, and see about allowing at least 1 alpha account. 

All in All, EVE is worth it... is it to expensive? I don't think so.... I pay over 100$ to take my family to eat once, and I can play EVE for 3 months on that. I think people are totally delusional about value of entertainment. They might need to go outside and get a reality check.",1673812018,1693279837,True,1,0,0.495689630508422852,0,True,False,False

While the game offers an enormous, player-driven universe that I find myself returning to every couple of years, it's also drawn ire for some poor business decisions, including microtransactions that have upset the balance for some players.

However, for me, the essence of EVE's appeal outweighs these drawbacks. The depth of its economic systems, the scope of its galactic politics, and the scale of its community-driven events are unmatched in the MMORPG genre. Every return visit uncovers something new, from gameplay mechanics to player alliances that shift the landscape of the universe.

Sure, it's not a perfect game, but its imperfections are part of what make it unique. In a sea of more formulaic online games, EVE's complexities and the real stakes involved in its player interactions set it apart and have allowed it to stand the test of time and remain relevant today.

EVE Online is an acquired taste complicated by some questionable business choices. Yet, despite its flaws, it offers an unparalleled, complex space experience that keeps drawing me back.

And this time, I got very close- I got the most involved with the game than I had ever been. I learned more. I cared about the well-being of my corporation and the friends I had made in this game. I honestly thought I’d be playing for many, many more years. I had even gotten my wife into the game!

But let me tell you- if you’ve heard all the amazing stories of what this game could be: the epic wars, battles involving hundreds of players, millions of ISK lost in betrayals: those days are long gone. Much as people will say that we were born too late to explore the Earth, and too early to explore Space, we are all too late to explore the peak of what Eve: Online was. And maybe we’re still too early to experience what Eve: Online could one day be.

All that’s left, then, is the core gameplay. And the bad news: the core gameplay is dreadfully boring. And as I and all the friends I had made slowly started to realize this (including, eventually, our CEO), we started dropping out of the game one by one. We all had said our goodbyes to ship-spinning, staring at our screens, waiting in Discord for anything to happen, mind-numbing mission grinding, and mobile-game levels of predatory monetization. Darn.

But what do I mean when I say the gameplay is boring?

Well, let’s take traveling, for example. Traveling from one location in the galaxy to another takes a lot of time. To be honest, I think is a super cool aspect of the game and it’s part of what makes it so grand, and it facilitates the economy since items will have different prices in different parts of the galaxy. However, we’ve all played games where it can take a while to travel from one part of the map to another. In a game like Red Dead Redemption, for example, it’s a relaxing and zen experience just jumping on your horse and riding to a new location. There’s stuff to do on the way, and you’re engaged most of the time. Maybe a better example would be a game like American Truck Simulator (which is comparable seeing as how both games have you hauling stuff a great deal). In ATS, they managed to make simple traveling from one location to another a great time. And this makes sense since this is going to be a LOT of what you’ll be doing.

In Eve: Online, you right-click from gate to gate and wait as you watch your ship go through its warp animations. It is mind-numbing, tedious, and it will take out a sizeable amount of your time. The only decisions you’ll ever make are whether to jump through a gate because you think it might be getting camped, which only means your trip is going to take longer. Some of these trips could take up to half an hour at a time. The game also gives you the option to auto-pilot, so you don’t have to deal with the tedium that is clicking on a menu every 15-30 seconds. But, of course, the cost of this is that your trip will take CONSIDERABLY more time (which makes no sense… why would a computer be less accurate with its warps than a person)?

Waiting and staring at your screen is this game’s core mechanic. Let’s look at another example: mining. Again, think about any game where you enjoyed mining. Mining can be a pleasant and relaxing experience all on its own. In Eve: Online, you right-click on a rock and just… wait. Again. For ages. No option even for a more actively engaging version of mining. Just stare at a pretty laser or gas cloud harvester for 30 minutes until you fill up, dock, drop off your rocks and repeat.

At least mining manages to be the perfect activity to do if you want to play a game passively while you do something like homework… except, no. Because of course, this is Eve, and you can still get ganked at any time. If you’re in high sec, this is far less likely, but there are players whose very existence is dedicated to destroying AFK miners. And if you’re trying to mine somewhere else such as lowsec, nullsec, or a wormhole… well then you don’t even get to enjoy doing homework because you’re there spamming the directional scanner the whole time to make sure you won’t get randomly attacked.

I want to make it clear that I’m not criticizing the open PVP of this game. That part is brilliant, and I’ll always love it. What I’m criticizing is just how boring doing some of the most basic stuff in this game can be: stuff that you’ll likely be doing a lot of.

This review is going to go on forever if I go this deep into everything wrong with Eve: Online, so I’m just going to mention a few more things:

- Joining corporations in this game sucks. Thanks to the early exploits and betrayals of players from a bygone age, trying to join a fun corporation can feel like applying for a real-life job. And many of these corporations still use old annoying third-party software like Mumble or Teamspeak, along with their own personal websites.

- The PvE missions in this game are extremely grindy and very boring. The industry missions literally just have you hauling stuff or mining stuff for NPCs, and we’ve already discussed how mind-numbing those activities can be. But even the combat missions were extremely dull. A friend and I tried to grind reputation so we could do any Epic Arc in null sec, and by the time we finally got the reputation we needed, we were ready to smack our heads into our computer screens just to feel something again. It might have helped if we could properly “party up” in the missions. We were doing them together, but we still had our own separate missions and the rewards had to be split 50/50 which means doing them together didn’t make the missions go any faster and didn’t make them any more excited because the missions don’t scale with the number of players.

- The experience in this game is gained in real-time, even when you’re offline. I always thought this was a cool mechanic, but it does mean you’re going to feel useless as a new player for a LONG time. So much of the early game will be focused on all the many things you can’t do. Naturally, there is a solution to this, in a game that already costs $20 a month for a premium subscription: buy more skill points to speed up your development. This makes the game feel like a straight-up mobile experience that you’re paying a premium for to play in the first place.

I’m getting tired of writing, so I’m just going to list a couple of things I still like about Eve: Online. Exploration is still fun, but it’s very lonely. I wish other activities had as much effort put effort into them as the scanning, but even that does begin to feel samey and boring after a while. I also still love the core ideas of Eve: Online- the completely open and free trade/economy, and the open PVP. Also, the game’s pretty, which is impressive given how old it is now.

People will often say that Eve: Online is only as fun as you make it. Well, I tried. I went out looking for more exciting things to do beyond mining and hauling. I tried PvE, PvP, Epic Arcs, and more. And no matter what the activity, they all gave me a very similar feeling: that is, I always felt like I was just waiting around for something more interesting to happen, and maybe sometime cooler could happen if I only had more skill points. And even though there were some fun and exciting moments, they weren’t even close to worth the amount of time and boredom I had endured to reach them.

I honestly don’t believe any number of updates could make Eve: Online a fun game nowadays. This game needs a fundamental rework of many of its core mechanics. What we need is the future that we are here too early to explore, Eve: Online 2, which could maybe take notes from other games that have managed to make traveling in spaceships fun, mining space rocks fun, and doing PvE missions with your friend’s fun, and so on. Until then, Eve: Online will remain an excellent MMO, but a mediocre game.

I have played every mmo out there and I keep coming back to Eve to get my fix for a little while...The graphics, music, and vastness of the game are what excite me. This game is 90% PvP, and over the years its gotten worse, several years ago it was better when people were not afraid to pull out big ships to use because back then it was not so expensive to build, nor was it hard to get the materials to build new ships. What makes the game Unique is this, You can literally pick field you want to be in. PvP? Engineering? Exploration? Industry? ect.... it has so much to offer, and yes every single one of those has a risk but still very fun. Now why am I not recommending it? Well two reasons. and many negative reviews fall on these two complaints......CCP & Veteran players. CCP is a greedy bunch who have slowly been ruining the game with gearing players towards spending more and more cash, making more accounts and more micro transactions. Back in the day what made Eve Online unique, was you focused on ""One"" account, you waited ""Real Life"" time for skills to tier up and depending on your implants and boosters determined if those skills raised faster or slower......this gave priority to those of use who spent years and hundreds and even thousands of $$$$ paying for a subscription an edge for our time and money. Now to help new players catch up to old all they have to do is open their wallet. Thats where CCP is screwing older players. Now for the other aspect of why I am giving this a negative review.......That problem is you guessed it the ""veteran player base"". Back in the day High security space meant ""Saftey"" Now with older, more experienced, richer players its nothing for them to just suicide, or gank you in high sec space , steal everything you have and run before concord comes to your aid, or in some case, groups of players so powerful they overthrow concord......Am I still going to play this game to satisfy my itch? Yes, Do I recommend it for new players trying to get a full experience of the game? No, unless your going to be okay with the possibility you could loose everything you worked for in an instant......However like I have learned, if you are careful, not going afk, paying attention to your surroundings you, dont haul massive amounts $$$ worth of loot, you just might survive. =D",1691761335,1691761335,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've sank so many hours into this game that one would deem me a ""professional"" but even then I still learn alot from day to day, this game is so incredibly complex that you'll never run out of stuff to learn or find out about new things you can do.

I've been playing this game on and off for almost a decade now and I can tell you that this is the worst game in existance with the best community.

Why worst game?
It's fucking dull, you target someone, you hit your modules and you shoot him and hope for the better, or is it?

There's alot of mechanics that come into play when you fight, which you will learn over the course of many fights if you do get into this game, mechanics I can't just explain, they come with experience.

Same goes for alot of activity like Planetary Interaction, Mining and the likes, the action you're undertaking is very, VERY boring (especially in high sec), but it's the suspense of someone being able to come out of nowhere and take your shiny ship to the abyss that keeps you going, a small bit of adrenaline, but then you finally settle down and go, yeah things are okay now, BOOM, hotdrop, 100s of players in system and your shiny 300m mining ship goes up in flames.


Enough of the anecdotes.

I can't stress enough how complicated this game is, not as in HARD, but it has alot of things you can do inside the game, and each activity has a whole encyclopedia on how you can do it better, what items you can get, etc. etc. etc. There's alot of depth to it.

My experience comes solely from pvp and a small bit of industry, things like this:
https://clips.twitch.tv/veetus/GloriousWormUleetBackup
(My name is FSync)

Just like that stream above, the guy got killed by me, I did not know him before but he made my day by just giving me the finger on his own stream after I killed him (he told me he was streaming after the kill).

People are really people in this game, not like your average cod player that joins your lobby to whom you will never see again, any player has a history, a circle of friends and networks, everything you do leads to another, there really is a butterfly effect in this game.

Whenever you are in a system and you see a person in local, if you look at his history, all the clans (corporations) and alliances he's been part of, all those people still know him, still remember him, still fly or talk with him occasionally.
The whole community is intwined with each other throughout the game because the community management tools inside the game are perfect, people can dictate whom they like or not and literally implement politics, this game has propaganda going on the web and thousands of stories from alot of players alike.

Even though for it's nice stories and events, the game has an argueable amount of active players (45k as writing this review) a day, make note that all these players are all playing on the same server, there's only a sheer amount of people who become interested in this game and their interest is literally limitless, the active gaming community of EVE is one of the most hardcore, but if not the most friendly community out there in any mmo, new players can expect ships and lots of ingame money to come their way and win their hearts over to join the evevets group.

To draw a conclusion about my review;

Pros:

- Game has alot of depth (playing for 10 years, still feel like a new player)
- Near limitless activities to do.
- Very active and friendly community though alot of trolling aka salt mining is abundant throughout the game.
- Sandbox (you decide what you want to do)
- Beautiful space scenery and ships
- Has a pretty good F2P option, people saying you can't do much with a F2P account should shut their prejudice mouth, I wish I had this option 10 years ago, I would've played at least 6 years with all the F2P ships that they can fly.
- The game has alot of IT playing in it, if you have computer problems and you mention it in corp/alliance chat there's at least everyone replying a solution to your computer problem, don't do it too often, you'll lose their interest in solving your problems.

Cons:

- Game pace is slow, for some this can be quite a turnoff.
- Game is very harsh, if you die you lose your shit, no refunds unless you have an alliance backing you with a ship replacement program, some might view this as a pro.
- Game is dull, as I mentioned before, the actions you take may seem boring, mining is just sitting at an asteroid and shooting lasers at it for hours, it's where talking with your friends or doing your real life administration while watching local/intel is coming into place here.
- May take a long time to get ""in"" to, the game is complex and requires alot of patience and common sense, something that 70% of the of the human population on the planet Earth lacks.
- Sandbox (some people like linear goals, referring to the con above this one) people might not know what to do and get bored and just leave.",1479645291,1691081386,True,0,0,0.500879228115081787,0,True,False,False

The dreadnoughts that i always wanted since 2016 all of a sudden were 5x as expensive or even more and even smaller ships were now almost as much as the equivalent of a months subscription.

The only reason i keep playing this game is because ive been dumb with my money and have a cousion i can spend when i lose a ship now and then. but if i didnt have that this would be a full time job if i wanted to even casually play with friends.

What made me finally come back to my review was that after getting berated by players for the last few year they finally added a pay to win pack in the shop. You can now by a pack that give a straight % increase to your damage and self repairing.

This game is old school, and pretty hard core. You have to think about what you're doing, plan ahead and be alert. There's no safety here, you can be blown up in any sector of space, no matter how 'secure' it is. If you're paying attention you can escape most situations before you get blown up.

I played the game during it's beta, crazy to think that was 20 years ago now, xD

This game mimics life in a lot of ways, the market within the game is like a real life market, and it can be utilized in much the same way. Some people choose to play this game, and rarely leave stations, or you can learn the skills and head out into the most dangerous sectors of space where no one will hear your screams when you die. You can join groups and become one of the gankers you hear so much about, or you can join a group that chases down and kills them. You can choose to be an explorer and look for undiscovered sectors of space (yes that does exsist even after 20 years of people playing the game thanks to wormholes)

Yes you can play this by yourself, I've been apart of corps, and been solo. They both have their merits, and both can be enjoyed. Being alone though, you will have to accept whatever happens to you. In a corp you can call for backup, which can end up sparking a war, something that is pretty impressive to watch happen.

Contrary to what people say, new players can, and do kill older players. There is only so many skills you can have, and ships can only be upgraded so much. So, playing for 5-10-20 years gives you no more advantage than playing for a month, they may have more skill points than you, but there are only 5 levels in a skill, so it does not take long to catch up, and there are ways to catch up faster. It's not like most games where you don't have a chance in hell at defeating older players.

Getting started, learning how to fly and go places, starting new adventures. No limits to where you can go, places to see and treasures to find.
Hunt pirates, provide security, haul goods to others locations or mine your own materials for cash.
The economy is fascinating, mining your own materials can be relaxing and fun, fill your hulls with minerals and Ore.
Take them to the station that pays the most for your haul and profit....right?

Reality*
Provide Security: You get geared up, then die immediately. Other Players ganked you just because.
Hunt Pirates or bounties: You get geared up, find some pirates and die immediately. Ganked again...
Start hauling missions: Fill you hulls and leave the station, *dies* ... you guessed it.
Mining missions: Work for yourself, go to a place where no one will find you, get you drones out and lasers, you start mining. An hour passes by, you are full of Ore and can go sell it for a profit! All of the sudden you explode, your drones go idle and a couple players come an take everything you worked so hard to make. You lose your ship, your drones and your will to play anymore.

1) Real Time Training (Unless you spend hundreds/thousands of dollars for Skill Point Injectors). The amount of time you have to spend waiting to train skills for your ship to become viable is actually insane and that's just for 1 specific ship with 1 specific setup, if you want to fly the same ship with a different fit (brawling vs kiting) be prepared to wait some more. There is no real way to speed up this process, it would be great if you could spend 10 hours mining and gain a boost to mining training for so many hours but that would interfere with buying Plex (in game currency basically) to buy Skill Injectors.

2) Scarcity: Basically CCP introduced the idea of wanting things to cost more, while making it harder to replace to help entice fighting, but realistically all this did was make people more risk adverse because most people don't want to spend 10 hours of PvE activities to fly a ship they could literally lose in less than 5 minutes from undocking. Industry costs to build ships should be lowered and PvE income should be increased so people can freely undock ships to fight for fun rather than worrying about calculating time it would take to replace their loss.

3) PvE and any general income making activity is mindlessly boring and needs a huge rework. Not everything needs to be super exciting and action packed because I can always enjoy spinning around some rocks mining and shooting the shit with the boys, but everything outside of abyssals requires almost 0 thought about actually playing the game besides making sure you stay alert enough to avoid being ganked which is not an enjoyable game play loop.",1688138405,1688138405,False,26,1,0.730695962905883789,0,True,False,False

History time!

I flew with -M.-. Witnessed the drama's that went on in Curse Alliance ""-CA-"". Then watched the formation of Lotka Volterra ""-LV-"". Battling -TCF- was memorable. Lonely being out in deep null sec though. When the Goons came, we were outnumbered. We'd kill 10 goons for every one of us lost but they had the numbers and they overwhelmed us eventually. 

Demoralized, -LV- disbanded. Most of us split up. I was pretty angry and decided to join our brothers up in Scalding Pass with Veritas Immortalis ""-V-"". It was a short year. The Redswarm was hitting a wall but even walls can fall and we were outnumbered by the swarm. -V- was demoralized also. Most us joined up with Band of Brothers -BoB- and was there for a good while. Till one morning, keen to log in and get some ratting down only to find our system flipped over to the Goons. Victims to ""metagaming""

Majority of us just un-motivated to play after that. I personally moved to a quiet low sec system, smashing out level 4's now 5's as I ""retire"" from null life. Been on and off this game since then. 

Would I do all that again? Yes I would. Being dragged out into null sec after one week playing was DIFFICULT but it was the most fun I've had in a MMO.

The downvote is specifically for the ""Daily Challanges' revamp CCP's done with the new expansion. Before, you could kill a NPC for 2,500 sp.

EVE is, unfortunately, only a shadow of what it once was. I won't go as far as to say that no one at CCP cares anymore, but the greed levels have steadily gone up over the last couple years, whereas the quality has steadily declined and the game has entered a self-destructive circle of developer indecision leading to long inactivity leading to issues spiraling out of hand leading to kneejerk ""fixes"" that at best break as much as they fix. The less said about the lore and universe changes in the last 8 years, the better.

As for the playerbase, despite the YT videos telling you every year that now is the greatest time to get into EVE, nearly no new players come to EVE. It's all just the same people getting new accounts, many of them hoping to finally strike it big in a continuously less fun and more grindy game, and each day, a couple of them log off for the last time, finally deciding it's not worth it anymore. Because it's not.

It's a great time to jump into EVE to witness the death of arguably the best MMO that ever existed, to witness the last sparks of its greatness. But a great time to play it? You'd probably have to go back to around 2013 for that. Don't believe me? All you need to do is look at the EVE Store. Used to be just sub and PLEX there, back when PLEX actually was ""Pilot License EXtension"" and not re-branded Aurum. Now it's skins, skill points, ships, what have you. 

Used to be that someone mined some space rocks, other guy bought and refined them and built a ship from them, possibly using a blueprint that other guy redeemed from a LP store for LP that he got for doing missions. Then that ship got sold on the market, or put into corpo storage and provided as part of one or another corpo replacement or rookie help program. Then someone jumped into the ship and went to shoot at people, or got shot at by people, eventually needing a new ship. This fueled not only the economy, but interactions, because no single person could easily do all of that, even with multiple characters.

Nowadays? You pull out a credit card. Or you join one of the big alliances which have too many players and resources for CCP to try and screw over (for now) with the understanding that you just entered into a second (unpaid) job combined with hierarchy and bureaucracy of a crappy IRL corporate job. You pay, or you work, there is no play anymore, no game anymore.

They're also constantly shitting on Industry making things more and more expensive to craft. But they refuse to address the actual broken things in the game that demand attention like how horribly unbalanced Covert Op ships are. 

A Prospect can fly around anywhere through enemy space unmolested. With its high speed and align time it can go anywhere. Combine that with its covert op cloak that allows it to warp around while cloaked its extremely difficult to catch them. There is literally only one way structure capable of decloaking an enemy so they can be found but not only does the structure have a low % chance to work, it takes a minimum of 20minutes to activate and is highly visible to all in system. 

Its absolutely asinine that covert op fleets only have to commit at most 30mil to the roam when they're able to light a cov cyno and blob anything. And as soon as they're done they're untouchable because they fuck off and cloak up waiting for the next cyno to be lit.

I used to have a negative review and none of that was wrong. Then I wrote this review and rated it positive; Then I changed the review to negative and put an addendum at the bottom. Any negative thing you've read about EVE has a hugely high probability of being true. EVE is a sandbox MMO already in an evolved state and that means there are parts of it that may make it disqualifying. Everything in the game except for humans at keyboards and maybe ""logistics"" (the property of where items are in space) is easily exchanged or related to real-world currency (and you can pay player groups to haul items to different locations). This is because to curb harmful Real-Money Trading (RMT), some measure of it must be allowed. This is done by the item of ""PLEX"" which is only generated when it is bought from CCP (EVE Online devs). PLEX has the value of being redeemable for a month of Subscription time. It is then, like other items, also sell-able on the in-game Market, for, of course, the in-game currency (ISK). Thus we have a valuation, but this is a one-way transaction -- you cannot convert in-game currency back to real-world currency, unless you break the game agreement and will get banned. EVE does not offer an escape from being crushed by the rich in away-from-keyboard life. And one can decide if they want to figure out how many cents per hour their life is worth, and how costly that mistake you just made was when your ship or other resources are lost, and be able to know these things and continue on.

The concept of ""pay to win"" may come to mind. It all comes down to ""win"" in a sandbox game and what you want to -- or are accepting of -- doing. Again at the large levels the rich are unassailable, and moreso each day. (If one does mining to ""make ISK"", is that 10 cents per hour worthy instead of just using real-world currency to buy ISK? [I do not recommend doing mining starting out.]) The wise value of genuinely asking ""who cares? about what?"" can also be useful. Aside from ISK, another decider of personal capability is ""SP"" -- skill points. These are accrued passively over time and are like ""experience points"" at capabilities using equipment (which ships, which weapons, Industry, etc.). And in a serious interest of keeping this all... contained, that is EVE. Now for some more asterisks.

The EVE player-retention curve drops off sharply as you'd expect. That's fine. The Company focuses on capturing young players's money. EVE is now the most expensive MMO I'm aware of at $20 USD/month. The discounts for mass-buying time are very large, which surely also is to the Company's advantage of trying to have people pay huge amounts in advance. The Company is untrustworthy, historically vindictive, capricious, prone to trends, product failures, and taking shady ""venture capital"" money. You should talk to someone before buying in. For example, an ""account"" has 3 character slots, but an account also has the limitation that you can never be using multiple characters simultaneously... to do that you need to have a separate account, and each account can then have one character logged in simultaneously. SP can be bought and sold on the Market (between players). The Company also broke their promise and sells SP for real-world currency.

There are mechanics that simply have no in-game explanation (to precision). Finding the right vet to talk to will save someone simply immeasurable time. This cannot be overstated. If you have a vet at disposal, be proactive to get on mic with them to likewise save them probably immeasurable time communicating. There are areas to be improved. Corporation logos have all of 4 shades to utilize (they are: red, yellow, blue, gray/white/black). The game is sixteen now and that's a long time to be stuck in a bubble.

Addendum: The devs have thrown one too many straws on the camel's back. At core -- possibly inherently -- EVE will probably always be a hellworld that in itself will never be of value to the self-actualized, whether it holds a monopoly forever on Fleet stuff or not. Individuals may provide solace, but they'd be better off to not be in it at all. (My negatives were regarding the core of EVE [and maybe the fate of any similar enough game?], but even on the Social level, Fleets are where the game culminates and are social. Repulsive comments on even one step above the smallest scale of fleets still happen, recent years have only afforded ""progress"" in that more people than before feel secure enough to make them.) There is no future in this. If one were to play, they must never let EVE change them for the negative.",1463736363,1684622093,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Old Review:
The game is very fun to play and its very open world, but there is no actual story line and you have to pay monthly to access all the ships. Even though you start with a ship, the only way to get the big ships is by paying £15 monthly.

Just wanted to start by giving the game a major plus; the sense of community can be amazing. EVE is designed to be a tough game, and it's much easier when grouping up with others. It often leads to forming bonds and friendships with other players. Some of my best memories of gaming during my teens were from this game and playing with others. I still remember the names of many pilots I used to fly with, over a decade since we went our separate ways. Unfortunately, past this it's all pretty much mostly negative.

The game has two forms of core progression, money and skill points. Both of which can be purchased with real money. It defeats any sense of accomplishment when anything you own or have accomplished can be earned instantly by someone with a bigger wallet.

PvE content largely involves warping to an area and blowing up hostile NPC ships as they bee-line straight towards you. The only difference between PvE content is the scenery, lore explanation for why you’re there, and what NPC faction is bee-lining towards you. The most accessible form of missions offer such pitiful rewards in terms of money per hour, you’ll be tempted just to reach for your credit card instead (almost as if by design)

PvP is more engaging, but as a new player you are going to get fucked sideways dozens of times by players flying expensive ships, with thousands of hours and kills under their belt. There’s so many nuanced game play mechanics that play a factor in PvP that are complicated to grasp, especially for new players.

The game hasn’t seen any new major game play systems since 2018, when they released what is essentially the EVE equivalent of PvE instanced dungeons. Since then, updates have largely just been variations of existing ships and graphical updates.

In short, it's a disappointing state for a game that was amazing a decade ago. Personally, I can't recommend it, unless you really really want to play a space-themed social game.",1684210696,1684210696,False,3,0,0.531761229038238525,0,True,False,False

Game was designed to be played with a monthly subscription like World of Warcraft and i have no idea why in the hell it is called free to play. So first of all, ignore the review calling this game pay to win, this is basically just a demo of the game.

Anyways to the rewiew of the game, i am sure you are here because you heard a story from this game, big fights loosing absolutely dumb amounts of real life money, i am gonna keep it simple and really quick.

The game involves absolutely everything you can think of when it comes to universe and politics.
People mine resources, refine them in player built stations to build more stations, ammo, modules, fuel and ships. 
Sounds like an awesome roleplay, it definitely is but everything takes time which is money.

Game is insanely complicated and feature rich, which means you gonna hit a fucking brick wall real quick when it comes to trying to learn the game by your self and not with the help of others. It's great that the game has a feature rich enviroment but sometimes too much is a too much.

The game controls is basicaly hotkeys and mouse, kind of like an rts style you order your ship to do something and it just follows the orders, don't expect any flying space sim with small ships like elite dangerous.

Can i recommend the game ? well it depends of what kind of person are you?
If you have a normal daily life and job, just don't, stop reading this review and leave now, this game is not for you, pretty much 60% or even high i could say are people that have some health issues and it does not allow them to have a real life interaction outside or just are not capable to do a job, i don't wanna say that is bad, if i would have some health issue that i could not overcome, i would probably play games all day long aswell.

This game just does not allow you to have any free time for any other game neither your hobbies. as others say this game is a second job and if you value your life and time, there are plenty of feature rich games that are far more easy to get into and definitely are still called games and not a microsoft excel simulator.

Its a great game except when its not.  Its great when you can be part of a corp and everything is clicking.  What ruined the game for me was the ganking and all the third party websites and service you need when you play.   I will explain each:
  The ganking is gotten to a point where solo players cant do anything without getting destroyed all the time. If you are running missions some players are waiting for you to attack and take you stuff. You can't stop them, because you ship is perfectly fitting for the mission you are running solo...not for pvp.  Even in high sec (safe space)  on ARC missions these players attack with alternate accounts and characters then steal you stuff. They gang up and attack you while hauling or mining or anything...it gets old.  The alternative is to join a corp and have help..which brings me to part two. Add to this that my skilled player of ten years is now worthless, because some new jack can upskill his day old character buy just buying the skills for real money....making ganking to pay back his in game money more appealing because it requires the least amount of effort and game time.
  Corps have turned into distrusting commies -KGB/CIA centers. Its now hard to get into them...they interview you....check your backgrounds....and deny you with even a hint of having been with another corp that you could be a spy for....which is all of them.  Its crazy..and i have never been a spy or wanted to be.   I had trouble getting back into my corp i was with just because I wanted to leave for a while.  This game lacks any depth outside of corp play and is boring without it and impossible to make money or have fun because of all the gankers and pirates.  High sec needs to have some areas to trade and mine and rat where gankers are not.  Its just to boring and costly to not.  If the game was $5 a month then fine...buts its now the most expensive MMO out.  I will no longer pay $20 a month to solo mine (zzzzzz) then lose my loot to some ass who sits on a gate (also zzz) near a trade hub to steal your stuff....rinse and repeat.

It's the ultimate experience for those who like to gamble with their virtual lives and who don't mind spending hours mining for resources just to lose it all in a single ambush. It's like playing Russian roulette with your spaceship.

But don't get me wrong, there's a lot to love about Eve Online. The graphics are stunning, the lore is deep, and the sense of community is unparalleled. There's nothing quite like banding together with a group of like-minded players to take on the challenges of the galaxy. Just don't get too attached to your ship, or your wallet, or your sanity.

One of the best things about Eve Online is the freedom it gives you to make your own path. Want to be a pirate and prey on unsuspecting players? Go for it. Want to be a space trucker, hauling goods across the galaxy? You can do that too. Want to be a diplomat, negotiating peace treaties between warring factions? Sure, why not. Just be prepared for the occasional explosion.

And speaking of explosions, Eve Online has some of the most intense and exhilarating battles you'll ever experience in an MMO. The adrenaline rush of being in the thick of a massive fleet engagement is something that's hard to describe. It's like being in a space opera, except the stakes are real and the consequences are permanent.

But with great freedom comes great risk, and Eve Online is not for the faint of heart. It's a game that requires patience, dedication, and a willingness to learn from your mistakes (of which there will be many). It's a game that can be frustrating, maddening, and downright soul-crushing at times. But it's also a game that can be incredibly rewarding, both in terms of in-game achievements and personal growth.

So, if you're looking for a game where you can create your own journey and get blown up, Eve Online is the perfect choice. Just don't forget to bring a sense of humor (and a healthy supply of tissues for when you inevitably lose that shiny new battleship).",1682964221,1682964221,True,11,4,0.61483299732208252,0,True,False,False

I don’t care about any item in-game that can be bought with real money (PLEX, Boosters, etc) CCP can definitely keep this other stuff out of regional pricing, since I’m not interested in it and never will be, I only care about the subscription which is called Omega and won’t affect the economy in-game, and that’s what really have the potential to keep new players out of the game with the current price.

Omega cost in Steam is R$107 in my country Brazil (around US$21) half the price of a triple AAA game (which is around R$200) for a monthly subscription, and more expensive than the US$20 if I bought it directly from the website. While in Argentina Omega costs around US$10.
https://steamdb.info/app/695740/

Now comparing to other MMOs and Streaming Services:

Runescape - R$ 27 / US$12.5 (Very Acceptable)
World of Warcraft - R$33 / US$15 (Acceptable)
WarThunder - R$40 / US$ ? (Acceptable)
The Elder Scrolls Online - R$ 55 / US$ 15 (Kind of Expensive)
Final Fantasy - R$ ? / US$ 15 (Too Expensive)
Eve Online - R$ 107 / US$20 (Extremely Expensive)

Netflix - R$26
Amazon PrimeVideo - R$15
DisneyPlus - R$28

Subscriptions/Memberships shouldn’t be above R$30 in my country, otherwise people think its not worth it.
If the price for Omega was around R$30, I would spend like R$120 to activate my 4 accounts without a problem, but paying R$107 for a single account? HELL NO!

EvE is tremendously immersive, has a huge world, a living economy, and dozens of things you can be doing at any given time.

What you will do, however, is spend 99% of your time doing everything you can to prevent your ship, assets, and work from being griefed by players with 10+ years and three boxed accounts sitting in-game literally 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

There are thousands of players with 20,000 hours in the game who literally never log off, have half a dozen bot accounts and scripts, and will blow up whatever, whenever, literally just the ""fun"" of griefing another player. They have in-depth knowledge of the rules of space (spoiler: they make no sense), and will abuse and exploit them to the Nth degree even losing money just to grief you in pseudo-""safe"" areas. They scam, cheat, lie, and steal in trades and the company openly endorses it, no joke--literally anything goes as long as you don't say ""bad words"" in chat boxes.

They've introduced ""PvP arenas"" but make no mistake, everything everywhere at all times is PvP, and 99.9% of the time ""PvP"" just means someone with absolutely 0 chance of fighting back being destroyed for a few seconds of amusement.

I've played EVE off and on for years. It says I have like 50 hours on steam because I started using the steam launcher so it would show my friends that I'm too busy to play something else with them. Don't judge me. We are here to discuss EVE Online.

It's way too far along at this point to get anywhere. I can't tell you how many lazy days I wanted to just go mining and chill to have myself blown up if I stepped away to take a leak. lots of griefing and grinding that makes you feel like you're not getting anywhere. I do have to give credit to the players who have stuck around since the beginning and invested countless hours. But those are the same people who will also make your life on this game hell and not in an exciting way. More of a ""you will NEVER stand a chance"" kind of way.

Its a bummer that Skill Training uses real life time, though it honestly hasn't hindered my ability to do all the things the game lets you do. It's a multiplayer game after all, so I can just fleet up and join other people with the fancier, bigger ships and play as a little wimp in the back shooting long range missiles and controlling drones or playing a support role to maintain friendlies shields/armor.  

I dislike that CCP added Skill Training 'loot boxes' so you can train your skills faster immediately. I definitely paid for them and I definitely felt that even though it saved me a bunch of time and got me into Nullsec faster, it felt cheesy and I felt like I've been cheated. But, I get it - there are players out there with like 10 years+ of training and if you really want to play with those people you gotta pay in time or money or both. 

Huge positive though is that all of the things you can buy with real life money, you can buy with in-game money that you earn. a lot of it is expensive, but when you're end game, you make enough to be able to buy your monthly subscription, or skill training boosters which is kind of nice. There is a bit of a diminishing return on skill boosters though when you reach 5million+ skill points though, so at some point you'll want to make a specialized alt for doing your more specialized money making tasks. 

I think the best strategy is to just pay some money up front to get a big jump on training so you can get to Nullsec as fast as you can so you can earn ISK faster with a corp, and then you can buy your OMEGA account and you can buy Multiple Pilot Training Certificates with earned ISK. You can use your alts as passive income generators and get yourself a nice little ecosystem going. 

This is definitely a game that you can play casually or excessively and is a good long term game.

I added it to my Steam library so I could play it on the Steam Deck. (And yes, that's right - although it says ""not supported,"" I was able to get it to start with no customizations at all. Who knows, maybe I'll hit a bug at some point and have to change some settings... but so far it has run just fine. The only thing is that I'm having to work hard to set up my own controller layout.)

Eve Online is easily one of my most favorite games of all time - hence being a paid member since about 2014. It's a space ship game, but you can do.... pretty much whatever, and be... pretty much whatever. You could be a feared space pirate, looting the cargo ships of industrialists. Or you could BE that industrialist, working hard to make billions. You could be a minor, traveling to the most risky places in the galaxy in search of rare ores.. a scientist, flying through wormholes to hack into ancient database systems.. A member of a Navy, defending your homeland... A planetary colony overseer.. A politician... I mean, I could just keep going on, but it would probably get old. Or, you could do a mix of them - this is not one of those games where you have to pick a profession at the start and then you're forever locked into it. Tired of being a space pirate? Maybe it's time to go out and work hard to restore your reputation and reinvest in being a capitalist investor. it's all up to you.

Eve Online has often been described as a ""spreadsheet simulator,"" so the functioning of this game is a little different from your average ""fly space ship/shoot space ship"" genre. The standard one has you in direct control of your ship, maybe using a WASD setup (or something similar) to go this way, roll that way, etc. The guns fire when you press the right button. It's often hair-trigger action, and each little movement and shot of the ship is controlled by you.

Well, in EO, you CAN fly the spaceship manually, I suppose, but a lot of it feels very, very different from the standard type of game. A lot of it is somewhat like, click to warp to this celestial object. Now, ""approach"" that local object, or orbit that space ship by however many km, or other things like that - and then your ship sets its own course relative to your commands. Systems are also a little different - rather than lining up your target in some kind of targeting reticle and smashing the spacebar (or whatever), you lock on to an enemy and then activate weapon modules. The weapon then goes through a TON of stats - such as the weapon's turret rotation speed, its overall accuracy, it's firing rate, and a TON of other stats - and fires continuously until you tell it to stop. Based on the hoards of stats of your own space ship, your own skill levels, the target space ship stats, the target pilot's skills, and a host of other crap, it's then decided if you hit or not and how much damage you did. 

There are tons of other support modules, as well - and I mean, just.... thousands of them. You could spend all day browsing the lists of modules available for space ships, trying to choose which one will work best for the task you want it for. Should I get... a shield BOOSTER, or a shield RECHARGER? Because there's a difference in how they function. Should I work to increase my capacitor efficiency... or should I just buy a system that can periodically inject a ton of energy into it? If I buy missiles, what type will work best for my current ship fit - torpedos, cruise missiles, heavy missiles, light missiles, rockets, or something else?

This leads to one of the greatest aspects of Eve - ship design. Some games boast, ""build your own ship!"" and then you spend minutes working through your dozens of options. With EO, the combinations of ships, weapons, modules, rigs, and everything else is.... stupefying. You can look online and find THOUSANDS upon THOUSANDS of player-built ships - each one claiming that THEIR fit is best, because it does this one tricky thing that the others don't do. You could spend your entire career tinkering, swapping, or even just throwing out old designs in favor of something new and better. 

Eve feels... dangerous, but somewhat fair. The old adage says that you're perfectly safe in EO, as long as you never leave a space station. Once you're ""out there,"" though, anything could happen - bad, or even good. But the thing is, it feels fair for being sometimes brutal. If you're a bad guy, you can target that poor sap in the small little ship... but if you do it in high security space, the police force is going to descend upon you like a ton of bricks, and your overall rep is going to go down. There is very often warning signs for what you may or may not be getting into - an example, if you're about to take on a particularly aggressive mission, it may tell you as much. Before you jump into dangerous systems.. a dialogue box will pop up with a warning. It's tough out there sometimes, and there ARE instances of getting killed by other players.. which can be frustrating, but in 9 years I have never ""quit."" Depending on the risks you take, you can have a pretty good life in this world.

The one thing that needs to be said about this game is that there's an enormous learning curve. You could spend STUPID amounts of hours in game doing this and that, and still be constantly learning new things. 9 years after joining, I will still run into things that make me go, ""HUH! This entire time, I thought it was this, but I was wrong!"" Or, I might decide to start paying more attention to this OTHER aspect of the game, and start doing some reading... and learn things I never even encountered in the last 9 years. 

This learning curve can be.... daunting for new players. A decent amount of players download the game, play a little, and quit just because it's so overwhelming. There is SO MUCH to do in this world, and so many ways to do it, that it can be a lot to take in. The absolute best advice I could give to new players is to either play with a friend who has been playing for a while... or make use of the game's social features to find your way into some kind of newbie Corp that will give you help and guidance. If you don't have someone to ""show you the ropes,"" so to speak, you could easily just sit staring at your computer screen, thinking, what now? Where should I even begin - and how would I begin in the first place? Find someone who will play with you and help you learn.

That's another great thing about EO - the community. Oh, you've got plenty of pirates and griefers, but again, there are risks involved with messing with you, and you can find ways to avoid bad situations anyway. Most of the community, though, is there for why you're there - to do all kinds of crazy stuff and pursue whatever goal you'd like. There are plenty of people who are more than willing to help - sometimes in VERY generous fashion - and contribute to the overall world.

The economic system is also pretty advanced. EO has a player-driven economy, meaning you don't ""go to the space port and buy this equipment for 100 ISK."" Something like 99% (or more, I forget) of all items in game are either created or acquired by players of the game, and everyone sets their own price. So when you go to a space station and look at the market, you're not looking at some server-created item set at a server-created price... you're buying X, which has been listed by player Y, and Z price.

The server resets deleting your inventory and items as well as other random disconnects causing you to lose just as much.

I can't accept that outlook as this is a product I've paid for and items lost on other platforms like Star Wars the old Republic along with World of Warcraft never happen. Nor do random disconnect issues with lag spikes that cause your own weapons and effects to not strike/ have an effect.

The fact that you could be firing a weapon but lag causes this to be lost to the aether and then you lose due to that same lag. It's unacceptable.
Especially as I have really high tier fibre optic internet that's over 200 mb connection.

Then you have your peers. Those peers who have no empathy whatsoever.

It is a lazy way to manage this aspect of the economy and am sickened by the attitude of the developers towards people who make the game miserable for others.  The attempts to limit ganking were a first step but it is unlikely anything else will be done as they seem to derive too much humour from it.


I have had EVE for many years but was always a bit hesitant to commit because of the steep learning curve and inescapable PvP (I play other MMO's where the PvP is only in select regions or consensual). 
 
With the introduction of the AIR Career Program to help with the learning curve I thought I would give it a go and so far I have found it quite enjoyable.  The threat of PvP at all times is still there, even in the safer 'Hi-Sec' regions (not a problem if that is what you are into), but one just has to be careful and maintain a sense situational awareness.  Having said that, I have yet to have had any problems in the 'Hi-Sec' zones I am primarily playing in and am slowly learning the ropes, and watching the plethora of tutorials available on YouTube and Steam, and will poke my nose into the other areas as I progress.

I guess if one is careful enough not to gamble with assets one cannot afford to lose things should be fine.  It's still early days so I will update this review as I go along.

As far as the game play goes I think it is much easier to pick up and control, in the outset, than say X4 or Elite Dangerous and the resource gathering, trading and manufacturing systems are very intuitive as is the ship and skill tree and upgrade system.

The graphics are excellent, having recently had the starter regions graphics upgraded as part of a game wide overhaul, and the audio and music is both atmospheric and immersive, even though in space 'no one can hear you scream' ;)

All in all it's worth dipping one's feet into the water as a free player as you still get to do quite a lot of stuff as what they call an 'Alpha'.  If you like it down the track one can upgrade to a paid 'Omega' player and access the games full range of ships, fittings and skills.

One slight problem I have had is with the link between the Steam account created when playing through here and the EVE Online game store which has had me have to raise a support request to, hopefully, get it fixed else my review may change to 'Not' recommended just on that basis, though if you intend to be a free player only, and not spend any money on the game, then it's a non-issue.  Also be aware of other, related,  problems with the Steam created account that are mentioned elsewhere in other reviews.",1657702013,1674384356,False,0,0,0.517985641956329346,0,True,False,False

Both games are incredible in their size, detail, environments and game play but if you could combine them into ONE game? Oh my. Imagine X4's ship designs and 4X game play in Eve Online. Man, I'd never go to work. LOL.

Anyway, Eve Online has been the ONLY sci-fi/military/MMO game worth playing for close to 2 decades now, if not longer. The attention to detail, the skill trees, the ships, the combat, it's just all so perfectly melded together to create an experience like nothing else on the market. Not to mention that the devs have been injecting upgrades to the engine itself and it is a beautiful experience as well. If EVE ONLINE ever created a single player version of their game and implemented the 4X factor it would be downright perfect. 

You can play for FREE. However, you will be locked out of almost 500 ships and the highest tier skills and that's just not good for long term play. However, if you're just jumping on board and giving it a try you could play free for quite a LONG, LONG, LONG time before feeling the need to upgrade to a paid tier. Of course, that depends on your play style but it can be done easily. 

Eve Online has a LOT going for it. A single shard/shared experience with thousands of players. An incredible ""newbie"" chat room that a LOT of experienced players use to give help to ""newbies"", A vast and complex skill tree system, ship upgrade paths and factions, job questing and LOOT. It really is an amazing game and one you should at least try just to see if it is up your alley in terms of what it offers. A fantastic experience that the devs, somehow, keep making more incredible as time goes on with the game.

[Edit Dec, 2022]:
After 10 years of playing and trying to love it again and again.. i think I can say a few things about the game

Good:

1. 10 years of game play is still not enough. There's more content than you can imagine.
2. At first it feels real good as you level up fast to better ships and keep seeing more content

Bad:
1. Community mechanics are just stupid. CCP knows it but does not have any solution.
For example: Making in game ISK (in game money) is just scorned upon by almost everyone.  CCP makes it harder for players to make ISK so that they can sell ISK for real money. So this makes the game a very ""Pay to Win"" game.

2. PvE content is almost as lame as any web game. Almost like a cheap knock off mobile game. 

3. You will never get to have fun (except for the first few days ) as it always feels like work and a second job.

Summary: Problem with the game is its ""Slow to start"",  ""very hard to make in game currency which is essential to level up"", Very hard to play with others unless you already know a few real life friends who play the game.",1354728378,1670884791,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Eve is a great game, The only one of it's kind, The only true sandbox MMO with the least regulation.

EVE is great but what it is, is a canvas. You often see people say why they don't like it and it normally boils down to ""Grieffed by players"" and ""Toxic community"" the thing is, It isn't a toxic community, It is one of the greatest communities and they will be your best friends or worst nightmare depending on what you paint on this canvas. EVE is what you make of it.

You may be surprised but see that one time you got ganked? If you picked yourself up afterwards maybe decided you wanted revenge and waited to kill said ganker or even just moved on. You will gain much respect from the community for being better and just getting on with it.  If you cry and whine about said gank you will only recieve ridicule, This is what people mean by ""toxic community"", The community will go out of their way to help an aspiring player, They will burn someone who comes in and tries to safespace EVE or cry on the forums.

In Lowsec if you as a new player are killed by a solo PvPer, GF in local, They will probably see that you are new and often offer advice (and on some occasions refund the whole ship / give you more) because it is in their interest to see you grow in EVE.


EVE online is amazing, I have played it since it was in Beta, While I have not been subbed 100% of the  time I have still  been many places, Done a great deal, tried all avenues. Been burned HARD and had great victories. Eve is Eve and that is what you are willing to make of it.

If you are new be sure to join the ingame ""help"" channels for when you do get stuck and for the love of all that is holy avoid the reddit.



Edit for 2022:
  
  CCP have upped the marketting and we have seen events like ""EVE x Doctor Who"" which i have to be honest is  a bit bizarre. They now straight up sell skill points in the marketplace for an exorbitant fee, This doesn't necesarily bother me as I think newer players need a catchup but I'd prefer if the SP they got where rewards for ingame activities.
 CCP have also taken an interest in NFT technology. this is widely considered to be a bad move but so far CCP have doubled down on it with the alliance tournament NFTs. We will see how that plays out. The review stands and the game is good but i thought I'd add these caveats.


Little update for May 2022:
        
           CCP has opted to increase the monthly sub of the game to $20  and increase the price of plex..

Well there is a space for you to go do that with missions, special ships, and even faction standings. Do you want to help the 'good' empires? Tons of missions to help you do that as well. Do you want to be a pirate or outlaw that just kills, kills, kills? Well eve will you do that no matter how much isk you lose or win. 

This is the one MMO that has kept me, where the people matter and the RP is backed by OOC shooting and pewing. If you are an RPer it doesn't get more immersive than making your villian mad only to have them bring in a 50 man fleet ( which is meh by eve standards) to try and knock over your sandcastle. 

If you aren't an RPer then every action you take, every item you make, every where you go it affects other people. You mine a bit more, someone else is allowed to make a product and sell it on the market for a better profit or a better price; which funds players to fight and destroy each-other in those massive battles which are on gaming websites. 

This is eve, where half the people are drunk, half of them are insane, but we all try to have fun and ♥♥♥♥ the other guys off more.

Edit: It's 2022. I had 5 accounts going and was loving this game until they decided to raise the membership to $20. Game hasn't really been updated besides a couple minor things here and there and it's not worth $20 a month. I decided about 6 months ago to cancel all memberships and just stop playing for good.

Alpha accounts (free to play) are very accessible, allowing you to basically access all the major activities the game has to offer. Exploration, Combat, and PvP are very doable in alpha states and with the expanded ship access and the alpha injectors, very easy to realize and obtainable goals can be made for free to play players to make for themselves. Mining, and Industry is a bit bare bones but that is to be expected as many of those have a much larger impact then combat type activities. As a returning player, alpha is nice as well once I'm reacquaint with controls as the builds for activities have become restrictive for my character is still fun to fit around.

Speaking of readjusting to the game. New character experience  (tutorial) and career agents are structured much better then how they used to be over  10 years ago. It really didn't take too long for me to get the hang of the controls again and once finished was able to jump right back into the mind set on my main. That being said I think it's great for new players as well, as the most basic concepts are laid out In a much more digestible way, and the career agents give a very basic, but nice little overview of some of the core things that can be done in the game. What impressed me also was the AIR missions which acted as a expanded tutorial and checklist of things to do in the game with some nice rewards to boot. Great way to encourage players to dabble into other forms of content. Impact right now since coming back I set a goal to try and complete the AIR objectives, and so far it's been a lot of fun.

The universe of EvE is still kicking if your looking to engage yourself in such things. This game actively encourages you to group up, meet people and join corporations(guilds) not only as a means to make activities easier, but to protect yourself from players who have other interests in you... There is a reason why this game has garnered a reputation it has for player interactions, but i assure you that you dont always need to be on guard. For first timers I highly recommend trying to seek out a corporation to join as it will make learning the game more forgiving and more fun in the long run. Plus most corps can be pretty new player friendly, just be sure to keep an open mind. That being said, as a solo player myself I can still find and partake in plenty of activities by myself. Again it may be more difficult to do solo, but for me that's the fun in it as well satisfying.

Overall it's in a good state playability wise. Lots to do and a nice way to kill the time. Plenty of stuff to do and goals to set. Again no need or pressure to rush to ""end game"" and maximize the meta. The meta in EvE is always there in the background, but thr flexibility of the game means you don't have to always follow or even takes things your own way.

I've had so much fun.

But things have changed over the years - and I'm not the one who claims ""eve is dead"" for years while plaing it.
Things within CCP have changed and decisions were made which changed the course of the development and the game. First there were a few, but over the years all the changes summed up and mutated the game dramaticly.
All the decisions and changes followed one path. To make the game more accessible, more casual, less demanding and finaly - make the player pay to win. But not just win, the latest news about recent and upcomming changes I've read are more like the game prostitute itself. From now on you can buy everything with real money - even things you couldn't buy or produce or win or seal or... whatever since 2003. It feels like in a year or two the GM status ingame will get a pricetag. 

I don't need to tell you that a game with such a history and reputation as one of the most demanding and thrilling games in gaming history - this path is a deadend.

Its greatest strength has always been that it does not push the player in any particular direction, allowing the player to choose their own path and really feel like they're living a space life.

However this has also proven to be a downside. New players from Traditional Themepark MMOs such as FF14 and WoW come expecting Main Story Quest Lines and other ""lead me around by the nose because I am not allowed to make true decisions for myself"" gameplay content -- then be in for a rude awakening when they discovered this game has much more in common with the likes of DayZ, Rust, ARK, Escape from Tarkov, etc. 

Choice has no meaning unless you have the opportunity to do the opposite. Most MMORPGs give players very little choice. EVE gives too much choice. How to intro players to this?

There are two possible reactions to this problem. 

1. Help new players disabuse themselves of those expectations, adapt to EVE's unique challenges, learn how to survive, how to set their own goals, how to make decisions for themselves, and how to have fun.

2. Attract gamers from other MMOs by modifying the EVE base experience to become more familiar to them - give them Story quests that lead them around by the nose Themepark style. This in turns completely fails to prepare them for how players actually play this game and delays developing the kind of mindset required to enjoy the experience. And this is, of course, what the developers are actually doing.

Do those PLEX packs in the DLC area worry you? They should. Those used to be optional. Now the devs nerf ingame spacemoney-making so that you will be tempted into opening your wallet. It's the same as GTAV Shark Cards or pretty much any F2P game, except you can actually lose your investments. They actively add ever increasingly frustrating, tedious grind busywork instead of fun. Think of everything this developer does as a cynical attempt to get more subscriptions.

The devs used to celebrate the players sandboxing together novel ways to play - now they seem to treat it as an annoyance. They don't play their own game - but are happy to dictate how they think you should play it. 

That is to say, in the last several years the developers have taken a decidedly tone-deaf, authoritarian and player-hostile stance. They frequently ignore their elected council of player representatives called the Council of Stellar Management, ram updates through even after beta testers strenuously warned otherwise, revert when the outrage starts to cost them money, and either make a half-baked apology or go on public interview stating the playerbase ""did not understand"" their vision. You can spend months, years and $100s into a preferred playstyle only to have it be destroyed by a new update, without compensation or consideration. 

Every time they try to ""balance,"" they break something else, often catastrophically. For instance, when they try to make things better for the solo or small group, they end up accidentally overpowering the large mega-groups. Many game breaking problems have remained unfixed for years. Systems that should have been overhauled years ago remain untouched and broken. Meanwhile they keep changing the UI in ways that are both prettier and actively more difficult to use. Little of *substance* ever gets changed. They take years to listen to anything the community says, such as wanting ship skins designed by player groups. 

More reading: https://dunkdinkle.com/why-eve-online-players-are-angry/

They don't even understand their own brand. The point of EVE is a sandbox universe with a single shard yet they rolled out a mobile game spinoff (by NetEase, of all people) in an alternate universe NOT connected to this server, riddled with even more microtransactions. 

The idea of EVE is more fun than the reality:

1 Grind for ingame spacemoney in PVE [OR] open thy wallet
2 Dodge everything in the universe trying to kill you
3 Waste spacemoney on PVP. ..... What, you thought you could skip Step 1 and be a Space Pirate making all your spacemoney from PVP? NOPE! PVP is *always* a money sink here.
4 Blow spacemoney on Skill Injectors to sit in new ships quicker rather than wait weeks
5 Run out of spacemoney
6 GOTO 1

The wars that go on in this game are fun to read about - but in practice are a series of neverending drudgeries. To remove just one single space station you must shoot it multiple days in a row, but the enemy can also create multiple more in the time it takes you to drop even one of them.

[b]Those big fleet battles you see in advertisements are a lie:[/b] They actually take place in slow-motion because the game actually has to go into bullet time in order to not crash the servers doing them. Expect to have terrible framerate in large fleet battles as well - EVE is coded in Python and is CPU bottlenecked because they can't multithread it. 

In the (paraphrased) words of Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation, it is increasingly a 2nd job you pay for. I regret spending money on this game; it's insidious and will drain your wallet faster than a casino if you're not careful. And the more money you sink in the less you'll want to leave.

Having stepped away for a few years, this really feels like a mobile game on coming back. The facade of f2p but with monetisation shoved in your face at every turn. 

So fine, I'll just sub again I thought. And then I nearly spat out my coffee. £16 a month at the time of review. Absolutely incredible. The most expensive MMO sub on the market. I wonder if they really think they're providing the value for that cost. I can resub to WoW right now for £10 and get a month sub plus full access to Classic without any additional charge. As much as I'm hardly an advocate for the new Activision Blizzard, they could easily have charged extra for that, but chose not to.

It seems like they have no idea what they're doing. There are other f2p MMO games around were you just buy the base game and then have zero montly fee. SWTOR for a good example. Sure, they shove a load of skins and cosmetics in your face all the time, but you kind of expect it since you're not funding the server costs. Then there are subscription MMOs that get you to meet server costs but throw in a bit of microtransaction stuff on top. Again, not ideal, but mostly it's cosmetic crap so who cares? Other games, like ESO even have a f2p model with a subscription, but it works because the subscription doesn't lock anything majorly game-changing away. It just gives you a few nice benefits like extra storage and some currency for skins.

This model that EVE has is really dumb though. Free to play except you can't really play very much at all. You can just fly about in your shitty low-skill ship because 90% of training is locked and you can't offline train. No corp is going to legitimately want you as a member because you'll be so ineffective that you'll just be wasting their time. And solo play is basically dead. And even if you spent 10 years paying subscription and running your skill queue to get into some tasty Tech 2 ships and modules, if you stop paying, you literally can't even fly your ship. So... where's the free to play part? It's free to poke around with a few things, but not free to play. Just call it what it is. It's a demo to try and sell you on the subscription. What was the point? Should have just kept it on a sub and not wasted everyone's time.

No, Steam. I am a masochist. I enjoy suffering and that is why I have 1,000 hours in on Steam over the years and probably at least that much before I started running it from Steam.

- You enjoy spreadsheets
- You have more than a passing interest in science fiction
- You enjoy flying spaceships
- You enjoy community, good bad and ugly
- You enjoy something big, complex, and that takes literal years (unless you take certain $hortcut$) to build your character's full potential
- You would enjoy developing your player skill such that you destroy the players who use the $hortcut$
- Tough but fair appeals to you
- You are willing to be flexible on your understanding of fair

We worked hard and saved in high sec, we built our first little structure (base) close to Amarr. We thought this game is amazing we are really going places! The next week we logged in just in time to see our base being surrounded and then destroyed, the enemy army was going through each system asking ransom for them not to destroy the bases! We knew if we paid they would destroy it either way, so there we were, homeless in space lost everything, so I went to Jita to ask other people what to do next? I met a guy at Jita who said leave it all and come to Null. I did so and the real game of EVE Online actually had begun! 
   From there on out I met others and this game became a life I couldn't have imagined with a new space family that was there throughout my adventures over the next few years! I cannot explain how great Eve is, yes it killed mining and has destroyed allot the great things about the game, but it is Eve, there simply nothing like it in the gaming world, no one ever leaves they just leave and come back, why because this space family is amazing and this game is a game that has given me a million experiences that no subscription could ruin!!!

I loved Eve for its atmosphere, intricate complexities and cutthroat environment. I was very invested in my characters as they slowly but surely accumulated skills over time.

I spent most of my time in Eve carving out a niche in low security space as a pirate, making friends in-game and out to band up with, to plot, stalk and settle scores with local rivals. Losses and victories were personal and meaningful. It was an incomparable experience. 

Although at times I joined the ranks of larger null sec coalitions, I never could quite settle in, craving to act on my own initiative and not get ordered around like a soulless drone - I did not want to play this game serving anyone else's agenda but my own. Eve was complex, deep and diverse and allowed for many different play styles.

Over time, I became another bitter veteran of the game. I ended my subscriptions when CCP stooped to cash grab mechanics, selling skill points for profit, introducing mechanics for instant gratifications, mechanics I felt went again the grain of Eve's original relentless, unforgiving nature. Over time, it became more and more apparent that CCP would only introduce designs aimed at satisfying newbies and their misguided expectations or the demands of the vocal null sec figureheads who play numbers games with their clueless sycophants. It ruined the game for me and many like me.

I started the game in 2011. It was my first MMORPG. I came back a few times over the years. Real life prevented me playing for a while, any MMO for that matter.

I think the problem with the ""vets"" that are bitter with the micro-transactions, the skill point packs, and the explorer packs is they don't realize the MMO world has changed, the way people play games has changed, work schedules have changed. 
People don't want to spend hours catching up. Some have the money to fund the game.

I deleted the bad review and I am writing this. I'll tell you why. The fact is... there isn't really another game like Eve. 
Except for the permitting multi-boxing on such a grand scale (I think there should be a limit of max 3 accounts per PC),  I can't really fault the way the system works. 

If it weren't for the changes, Eve would appear almost insurmountable for new players. For those that want to fly the latest ships faster, let them fund the game for the rest of us. EvE doesn't charge for expansions. Wow is US$40 for the base pack, then $50 for the latest expansion. If you take that into consideration, the subscription sort of evens out. It would be great if it was $15, but it is what it is.

The alpha pack with the 1 million offer if you click on a link is a really good way to get into the game and get hundreds of hours of enjoyment for nothing while learning the ropes. After 20 more days after applying the 1 million points, you can pretty much fly some of the better ships. Even with the alpha, you can have a lot of fun in the game. 

Alternatively, if you spend $99 on the platinum pack, you can get really well skilled and in a good ship and be flush with cash and have a three-month sub.

People complaining about Pay 2 Win don't get it. As long as ANY game support multi-boxing, it will have P2W elements. If you want to be overpowered, fear the 20 frigates waiting for you at a gate. If you encounter a multiboxer firing 5 or 20 salvos at you at the same time, you're toast. The thing is that not many people can sustain that sort of money and eventually, their Eve career will end. 

Unlike other MMO's, the game is not full of bots. Over-the-Top Multi-boxers are not that common.

The skill packs are pretty much not that important if you skill about seven million points into a particular ship (about 120 days). Even with a million, however, the game is fun.

Spending more money doesn't give you more skill. You can lose a Tengu if you pay for max skills. It's not going to give you the skill to fly it... and those mistakes in expensive ships cost a LOT of money!

So, I'm back for now. Omega Activated. 

- on my Twitch channel (search for theWocky) is a link to get 1 million skill points. Come play Alpha. It's truly an experience. 

I'll be streaming from time to time.

To the vets, why so mad? It's just a game. If you look at it in a broad sense, it's not a bad deal.",1658644956,1661255075,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love sci-fi and spaceships so this game should be right up my alley, it is not. The game is incredibly convoluted and arbitrary, equating to spending hours upon hours researching things just to understand how to play the game.

This would be fine if it was followed up with further information as to “if you want to do this then i would recommend that” but it is not. If anyone does try to answer, someone will immediately tell you they are wrong. Moral of the story there are no clear answers for anything. What’s a fast way to make Isk “it depends” yes i understand but surely some ways are better than others. The second answer to any question is out of date. I cannot tell you the amount of information that exists from 2013 that is no longer relevant today. On top of this incredibly high barrier to entry is skill training. Skill training will take literal months and most skills cannot be trained without buying into the Omega. But have no fear you will be dead long before any of that matters.

There isn't a lot of competition on the market except a few tycoons (some products with lucrative margins are only updated by one or two traders) and the industrialists are not producing that much, as if overall the market has less demands than offers on most products.

The wh / low / null sectors aren't that dangerous anymore and if you don't stay around trade hubs there are chances you won't meet a player for hours. There aren't enough opportunities to PvP, and when it happens it's generally against a multi-account player. So it turns out to enjoy myself in PvP I have to join fleets, however there isn't much going on working days.

Overall the game has less activity than when I played years ago and feels dead !
The player count is constantly dwindling ever since CCP increased the subscription fees, the cost isn't worth the product. Even worse, the less players, the more microtransactions gets added as if they are set on milking the cow before killing it...

To better build your perspective you can query 'EVE population stats' on a search engine such as Google and check out which update correlates with the population drop.


If you really want to play the game I'd suggest sticking to a free-to-play account to do faction warfare or join a corporation with daily PvP (other activites such as mining, industry, exploration or ratting are lame without subscription).
Eventually you can do station trading (takes 10 - 20 min a day) to invest into the Omega subscription however it's a long grind if you don't have a starting capital of billions, especially with limited Alpha market orders.

The first expansion (Enter the Abyss) under Pearl Abyss added a new ""God"" of the domain when we were all starting to accept Bob (WH God). This new ones name goes by RNGesus. That's right RNG is now in EVE. 14 years of playing this game (On and off for the first 4), and the first thing these f**king idiots do is s**t directly on their mainline. If you want to play some stupid Korean MMO, go play a f**king Korean MMO, don't bring that bulls**t into this game. 

There's a slow exodus from eve right now. You can see it in the number of players online over a 5 year period and you can see from the release of Enter the Abyss there's already been a loss of 10k players. Now people are probably going to be quick to point out, ""THIS IS THE BEST EVE HAS EVER DONE!"" No, you're actually completely wrong! Back in 2011 and 2013 we saw numbers of 60k+ in players online. They'll also say, ""Well that's because of all those people with tons of alts!"" No, maybe the incursion guy with 40+ accounts left. Or the solo run Mining Fleets of 40+ accounts left due to broadcasting in ISboxer being determined illegal to use; but that doesn't make up the 20k+ average of ""currently online"" players who left. ""It's just slow during the winter, everyone goes back to school!"", that's just not true, the peak! during a year of eve online is in the summer, definitely. but the peaks over the last two years has only reached a height of 35k+ at a single time. 

""That's just the ONLINE number. There's a lot of players who SUBSCRIBE, that play throughout the day, and have jobs and aren't actually logging in."" 1) You don't have access to the subcription numbers. 2) still doesn't mean it's not easily reflected in the number of players online. 60k+ is the number of how many people were ONLINE in 2011 and 2013. Since then the game is starting to die.

Lowsec PVP/Faction warfare is dead, Nullsec has been the same donut, I call it a C-Hole (up to you what the C stands for) because it's run by, just the same Coalitions that have been trading hands for the last 9 years. Never listen to a player from Nullsec or Lowsec, they're elitest K-space F1 warriors that quite literally have no idea what they're talking about in the in the grand scope of this game. UNLESS!!! they're an FC, and even then that's pushing it with some of the trash FCs and their fleet docs out there.

Wormhole Corps are the people you should actually listen to. They're like the bear hibernating right now trying to weather this slow death and hope it's just a bloody cough, and not full on cancer. WHC's have the most fun in this game hands down, except for right now. All they do is hold themselves up in J-space and farm their C3-C5 holes. They don't usually bother with C6 because, well, you'll probably never be in a corp that can get their shit together enough to farm those, so get rid of the pipe dream early. Basically, you have to be a horder in WH, that's also ready to lose everything in a single moment. Ever since citadels released (Thank Bob!)

Anyway, Point being. This game is dying, and the player base doesn't want to admit it, or the playerbase is just stupid... which they are. Have fun with Nazi symbols and male Space Genitalia spread across space using MTU and Depots, so i think that's probably a given either way you look at it.

They'd rather put up with a company that has proven itself to be the worst when it comes to their practices involving money. After the RNG item bulls**t in EVE you can expect even more MT items in the MT shop, NO ONE WANTED! pertaining to RNG. CCP messed up and put in skill injectors and skill extracters that really killed the playerbase. 

It's just sad that they sold it to a company that's already killed their other game in the US and EU markets. They couldn't be bothered to fix that one because it's such a lost cause, that they just decided spending 400 million on another game was better for investors than fixing their main game. This is why Koreans don't build games that last. It's like all these Korean Companies do is, ""Oh, WE PEAKED! We haven't seen steady growth over the last year, time to let it die and move onto a new one!"" and they just chuck a ton of potential into the trashcan and alienate their old playerbase to bring in money sluts and whales.

EDIT: Literally said this in 2018 lmao. XD this game is dead thanks to pearl abyss. move on. I like the guy that says he has 5m skill points and played hundreds of hours.

Mining is boring. You watch your ship float in space and sometimes you move cargo around.

Exploration is boring. It's a bunch of warping/jumping, waiting for probe scans to complete and then rearranging the probes. Hacking minigame gets boring too.

The sunken cost fallacy then keeps players going. Stills are learned not by playing but time passing so much of the game is artificially gate-kept with no real content to help pass the time. 

The ""fun"" things players do in game is almost exclusively PVP content that mostly involves camping at a warp gate for 10 min to 6 vs 1 an unsuspecting victim or some other asymmetrical combat that rarely involves skill. With no real safe zones to leisurely play in, Eve is packed with some of the most tenacious and hard core gankers of any game and rewards deep pocketed whales that can spend real money to help build and equip new ships. PVE content, while technically exists, is mostly still within the PVP world with the exception of Abyssal instances that have steep penalties for failure (loss of ship and all items carried in). The missions/quests have very little depth and only about a dozen scripts so no real lore or story to help compel you forward. The game mechanics, while fun at its core, are designed to just be a money sink where items, ships, and materials, are just consumed and destroyed to help promote spending more real world money to replace what is lost. 

Although the game is labeled free to play, the free tier of the game is severely limited on what you can equip and what you can fly which inevitably limits what you can do which is primarily limited to PVP which promotes the money sink by losing ships and items that you cannot afford to replace by the artificial limitations put in to promote you paying the monthly free or converting real money into in-game money.

What keeps me playing? Sunken cost fallacy. I love being a healer in groups and I can in here. I own so much already in the game, have all these skills, and know how to waste time in the game so I habitually fall into this rather than looking for other, better, games that I could be happier playing.

In summary; what could be a fun game is lost in game mechanics intending for you to spend real money in a deceitful pay to win business model.

Ohh where do I start. I started eve back in 2013 and continued to play off and on over the years. I have put countless amounts of hours into this game. I was addicted to this game constantly getting on to play for a few hours a day. The game was fun for a long time... however nothing lasts for ever. I think I started to notice that the game was going down hill about 2-3 years ago and ever since it just continues on a downward trend. The developers said that there will be new content coming in the future but there was hardly any during that time. Instead they started to focus on the in game economy saying that ""there to much currency being generated vs being taken out of the game."" So they went and disrupt the market in a attempt to get the games ""economy"" to a healthy state. however I believe that it was already in a healthy state. but I said to my self alright there nothing wrong with correcting the market but I was wrong.

Later on down the road they introduced scarcity update to mining which absolutely decimated asteroid mining. it was sad to see a strip miner 1 destroy a single asteroid with a half to quarter cycle of mining. Then they came back and increased the size of them by a little bit so now it would take a full cycle to half a cycle of mining to destroy a asteroid. I still have not mentioned at that time they reduced the yield of all the ore at that time which made it even harder. After that they increased it a bit more which seemed better. then they ended scarcity which I thought was great until I read the patch notes. All asteroids were to be doubled in size however CCP added in a mechanic that completely negated this change. That mechanic is called mining waste which basically cut the amount in the asteroids which was double in half. Figure out that one which still confuses me today...

I would continue going on but there are other detail reviews which can provide insight on how the game is. I would still recommend it to a person that has not played it yet but warn them that with out paying for subscription and or buy a bit of plex to get skill injectors it will take years to get all the skills max out.

The following is what EVE was and why it hurts my heart not recommending this game but this is what CCP is killing right now with their greed.

EVE is the pinnacle of sandbox games - The base game is a massive pile of stinking, boring garbage and there's no way in hell someone would play it solo for a long time without going insane, however, the players MAKE the game to what it is - EVE Online.

Yes. Everything in this game is done by other players. Bases, products, news, billboards, ships, weapons, ammunition, you name it. The developer has done barely anything to implement anything into the game content wise and that's good. Because even the content is done by players.  Pirates in Low-Sec who kill for a plethora of reasons or just to ruin your day, Mining fleets, imagine playing X4 Foundations but every single person you meet is an actual player. Except for the Mission Agents and NPC ships, but as said, that part is borderline boring at some point.

I recommend this game if you want to see what a true Multiplayer sandbox looks like. You don't just go and build your house, you play in an environment that's empty. Players fill this environment with their ideas and creations making that very environment it's own game. EVE is not about flying in a vast, empty space filled with nothing. It's whatever you want it to be.

So is EVE a good game? Hell no. Why should you play it? Because it could become a good game for you. And to be brutally honest, although this pretty much is a pile of digital shit, it's my pile of digital shit and many others. And we love it. We live with it and we like it for what we make it to be.",1650262722,1654800749,False,0,0,0.442675173282623291,0,True,False,False

I have a few hours in eve, so let's be real;

For years the development team have struggled to implement meaningful or impactful changes, mired by internal scandals and a toxic workplace culture where workloads and updates are left to the last moment, resulting in a routinely rushed end product for their customers. Almost all the good dev's have left leaving a path of least resistance for certain other dev's who have failed upwards. Large parts of the game are stagnant and need desperate reworks or additions (wormholes/ FW space/ pochven/ missions, to name just a few)

In the last few years they decided to introduce ingame ""scarcity"" resulting in the costs of ships and modules skyrocketing. Bare in mind this is in a PvP game where all 'on character' items are lost on death, The end result was that to play eve you'd still have to pay for a subscription but the costs of your in game fun were also now dramatically more, while earning opportunities had been removed, i'm sure even you reader with your likely limited grasp of the in game systems and complexity can already see how unfun that would be...right? Well! It took CCP 2+ years but they eventually realised the damage this was doing and have drastically reversed some of the changes. But it seems like that a critical mass of industrialists and other players were lost during those scarcity years. At 20 years old eve doesn't get large influxes of new players, so when old accounts like this leave, those are lights in the Eve universe that in many cases go out for good.

Now the real reason for this review. CCP, the company who make Eve Online make millions from the sale of skins alone, more than enough to keep the game running and provide the kind of meagre maintenance updates that Eve more or less gets these days. But they've recently announced a 30% subscription price increase too. There is no real justification for this other than greed. A game as old as Eve should be looking to cut its sub price to attract new players. Instead the company have decided to squeeze as much out of the existing playerbase as they can before the inevitable decline reaches a tipping point.

I want to be clear, I love Eve, I've had some of the best gaming experiences of my life in this little universe.
But the games economy is faltering, the playerbase is falling, most of the devs don't play or understand their game and those at the top of the company see you as an easy $$ rather than a valued customer.

In conclusion, would I recommend the game to new players? If you have a time machine, definitely!
Otherwise, probably not anymore sadly.",1651332780,1651332780,False,58,2,0.823047041893005371,2,True,False,False

EVE Online has long since passed its peak. All the stories you hear of epic battles and corporate espionage are stories from the past. EVE started as an MMO from a mostly bygone era of taking risks, and has since transitioned to the modern era of making games geared toward everyone's favorite three-letter words: MTX and NFT. The only part of the triad missing here is Pay-to-Earn (P2E) which is probably off the table if for no other reason than it would actually take a good chunk of effort to implement into this decades-old game's spaghetti code. CCP's focus has long since shifted from game improvements and quality content additions to trying to bleed their stone of every dollar they can get out of it, and in the recent couple of years they've even stopped trying to stray away from less popular monetization methods in favor of doing whatever they can regardless of player opinion. The needs and wants of players have been pushed to the lowest priority, and the game has been hit with a slew of changes and additions which have been varying degrees of unpopular to downright game-ruining. The developers have been engaging in almost pure misses for years now, and any hope of a reversal died when Pearl Abyss acquired the company. Old storylines have been abandoned, new features make the game worse, the balance and economy has become increasingly confused, and the old tenets that defined what EVE Online is at its very core are being stripped away.

Want to train skills? Buy it with real money! Need in-game currency? Buy it with real money! Need a ship? Buy that with real money too! Remember, one of EVE Online's defining features is supposed to be a ""player-driven economy."" Once upon a time that was certainly true.

All of that is before you get to looking at endemic issues with the game and its culture, like rampant use of bots and multiboxing which give a false impression of a decent player count. This isn't a game you'll be playing with just your friends, you'll be playing this game with your two other multibox accounts, and your friend and their three multibox accounts, going on PVP romps to try and kill bot fleets of miners and ratters. I once joked to some fellow EVE players far more veteran than I am that ""probably a third of active accounts are multiboxers and bots,"" to which I was told that my estimate was extremely low, and it pans out when you look at CCP's approach to multiboxing. Not only is multiboxing allowed with certain regulations (bots aren't technically allowed but you can find bot operations in game) but CCP's monetization strategies actually encourage use of multiboxing. In my personal experiences with EVE, I very rarely met players who didn't multibox, and those I did meet usually didn't because of economic constraints either in the game or in real life.

Before CCP started showing signs of death flailing (even before the PA acquisition) I would've said that people might like EVE Online if you were into these kinds of grindy, high-stakes PVP games, but that ship has long since sailed. All that's really left here is disappointment; you play the game and you see the abandoned storylines, the unrealized possibilities, the balance issues, the economy issues, and so on and so forth until you realize ""this game could have been great!"" Then you ""win"" (quit) EVE and maybe watch a Rooks and Kings from time to time to try and remember the good old days.

CCP just recently announced a huge 34% increase to their sub costs and plex costs. This game will cost you a minimum of 20 dollars a month now just to play. With each update things get increasingly more and more unstable. They had quite the predatory move today where they introduced an Omega (sub fee) sale, and then directly after that stated they'd be increasing the sub costs by 34%. This company has been on a solid decline for four years, it was purchased by Pearl Abyss (owners of Black desert online) and it's just gotten more and more monotized. They aren't interested in listening to the CSM instead they try to harness them as a tool to further their P2W/Predatory agenda. They've introduced several new ad's that are specifically targeted at new players and a very large attempt to separate you from whatever you have in your bank account. This is messed up.  My alliance over 1.1k characters (roughly 200-300 people) has experienced a mass exodus today. Me being part of it. We aren't the only alliance that is unsubbing our accounts and moving on either. Some of the biggest bloc's in the game like Goons are also encouraging people to finally put the game down and move on with their lives. This can only be one last futile attempt from the developers to cash out. I'm disgusted, I'm angry, I refuse to pay your increased fee's. To think you guys had the audacity to do this without releasing any decent sort of content for the past four years.






Here I am almost 500 hours into eve and I haven't even scratched the surface. So much to do, so little time. I vowed never to sub to a game, well that all changed about a year ago when I picked up eve. Not only do I have one account but I have 5 in total now. Some of the features are more fun or productive with more characters, hell even CCP offers or did offer a discount on your second account. Character buying/trading is legal, you can scam the living daylights out of people and CCP just laughs (make it a big enough scam and you'll end up in the EVE book!) This game actually inspired me to get back into school and get a degree this time in hopes to work for a company like CCP. They don't act like gods or even admins, they list to people if they messed up the players amass and burn a monunment or something and CCP makes the changes needed. The creaters are amazing, the game you can do anything imaginable, Manufacture drugs, pirate, move freight, mine, build, explore... so much stuff. I give this game a 10/10 :D


Just wanted to edit this original review now that I'm past the 2000 hour mark. I've never had so many headaches in my life from a video game. I've gone through several of the big Bloc-alliances and the politics are crazy. I've flown the biggest ships in the game, killed them too. Met some of the greatest people in my life on this game. I've also met and become the underbelly of society due to this game. EvE gives you this ability to build a persona and build upon it with limitless options. I do love it, but I also hate it. If you are a casual player, you won't really amount to much. Put in the effort, you won't be disappointed. 11/10


Second Edit, over 3k hours and still going strong. Recently got bored with Null-sec and have found myself doing small gang PVP and evictions in Wormhole space. Yet another aspect of the game to explore. The devs at times have mad me a little upset, but I believe that the ""chaos-era"" is for the best. Game is old and a great cancer has been spreading through it called stagnation. It has killed many MMO's, but CCP is taking steps to change the ""meta"" and how the game is played. Rapid changes without announcement has ticked a lot of players off, but it has also made for one heck of a summer. Logging in after downtime just to discover local chat was gone, or cyno's changed really made for some interesting fights. I've seen a lot of reviews about how people are upset that scamming is allowed in this game. My answer is too bad, stop being dumb and trusting everyone who has a slight sparkle in their eye. People who aren't paying enough attention to realize what is going on, thank you because of you I don't have to pay 15 dollars a month to play. I just PLEX my accounts with their hard earned ISK.

---------- 4.5k hour update --------

What is life anymore? Is it EvE? I've fought a hundred battles, lived a thousand lives yet still I search for the answer. Just kidding, here I am with over half a year worth of playtime. Currently the game is in a war called World War Bee 2, entire game vs 1 alliance. Meanwhile in High-sec its being invaded by a new alien species called the Triglavian's who have some amazing ships. New mechanics are being added in and old ones tweaked. Currently the entire game is suffering a huge resource shortage due to these changes which has driven prices up. PLEX (in-game premium currency) is nearly worthless, but this makes it very easy to pay for a sub without IRL cash.
                   I'm still undecided if this is a good thing or bad. EvE is still quite a niche game, but I'd love to see more players get involved. Most of the time it sits around 25-35k players, I'd love to see that hit and stay at 45-50k. I've left wormholes after a year and re-joined Null-sec to assist and take part in this war. Currently in a smaller sov holding alliance and its a ton of fun. I still suggest this game, I still want to see you playing it. EvE is more than just Excel... (I did end up buying that program because of this game...) You learn IRL skills. I was able to learn valuable skills in resource/supply chain management and it has landed me a job more than once. I felt like I could compete with people with a four year degree because I had the hands on experience they lacked. I've learned a lot about human interaction and how it can affect markets. I can honestly say my life has benefited from my time playing this game. I will be honest though, it has cost me a relationship. Granted, I am now thankful that fell through (really dodged a bullet with that one!) Play EvE!",1447841360,1650664802,False,1,1,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,False

This game can really suck if you get in a rut. Before I got into null sec, Eve was pretty meh. The reason wasn't just because I was mining or mission running, it was meh because I did not get plugged in.
 
WWBII transformed the way I play Eve and the people I met and flew with gave me some of the best gaming memories of my life. While I do prefer smaller gang roams of 30 or so people, flying in massive 256 man fleets under some of the best FCs in Eve is pretty amazing. Was in RECON alliance on Panfam side of the war. I flew under PGL a few times but mainly under Hedliner and the rest of the Panfam FCs. I also got pretty familiar with several people in NC. and learned a TON hunting under the amazing SpotlessBlade with his super fun Market Watch (discord ping channel) roams. Unfortunately I no longer go on the roams anymore as I am now in FRT, did a few times but meeting in thera instead of their preferred R10 and neut/blue conflicts on certain targets made it a PITA.
 
I don't feel like I am missing too much being in FRT though as Joann, BJK, Zigam, Torcea, Norus, Gauzee and all the other awesome FCs provide non-stop fun as they selflessly ""herd cats"" and try to direct us (often drunk cretins) to our next objective.

It is tacky to drop names but the point is the people behind those names make up Eve.

Think about how stupid you would feel to spend money on a package that gives you a character with skills and a ship to allow you to gather resources to build things when you can just buy the end product from the cash shop? Talk about a waste of money.

However please be ready to spend a lot of time (or real money instead) if you want to fully enjoy it. Losing a ship is probably devastating (no matter in PvE or PvP) because you will loose the ship, together with most of the gears and cargos in it permanently. In that way the price of gears will never drop, since they are continuously in the midway of manufactured/looted/explored and blew up. Thus PvP is both profitable (if you have the skill and patiently) and costly (if you lose your ship and pod, well, you need to buy a fresh new one).
The control is a little bit complex and you need to study a lot: angular velocity, missile damage formula, sensor strength and resolution, warp scrambler distance, CPU and Power Grid distribution, etc. The in-game skill (increase according to the real life time) is important but not omnipotent. A veteran player can easily solo L2 mission in a frigate (notably Tristan or Kestrel) with only days of training time on a new toon, because he knows the NPC's damage dealt type, vulnerability, attack range and who is the key mob (which will call new wave of reinforcement when damaged).
Also, don't let the subscription fee scare you. You can buy it in in-game market with in-game currency (called ISK). By playing it for two months in hi-sec, doing L4 missions, I can already afford one. Maybe I will invest the money into a more efficient battleship to further my farming speed, but you really won't need to pay 15 bucks each month, you see.
BTW, remember the terms: Pyfa, EVEMon and EVEMarketer if you plan to start EVE, and be patient for the first half month. Soon you will love the game and start to Google the terms I provided above. They will make your life a lot easier. :)

Invest some effort in understanding how things work and in forming relationships with (gasp) other people and it can be richly rewarding with virtually any goal achievable.  Want to hang with pals and be space miners?  Space moguls?  Space pirates?  Or work with large groups of folks to be Sky Mashal or Space Warlord?  All wide open, limited only by your commitment.

Go in hoping to ""lone wolf"" your way through yet another MMO and you will most likely miss the point and burn out quickly.  PvP is a reality - you can spend your time trying to avoid it, and largely be successful at doing so, but make no mistake that you are still playing PvP, you've just elected to be a herbivore.  

All that said, there is lots of room for ""crafting"" playstyles, and the player market is hands-down the best of any MMO I've tried.  And it IS possible to play this game solo if you are of a particular somewhat-warped mindset (like mine), though its more difficult.

I started playing 2007 and have ""quit"" now three times... but now with a free-to-play (albeit quite limited) model I'll still log in from time to time.

Quick 2019 addendum.  I'm back in for round 4.  There just isn't anything else like this, if this is your kind of game.

2021 Update.  I'm still playing, and had great fun during the ""big war"" over the last 18 months.  However, the last 2 years of industrial gameplay changes have basically destroyed industry (crafting) as a ""profession"", with margins generally negative and customers absent.  At this point I can't recommend this game for new players.

2022 Update.  Out again.  A combination lack of meaningful (to me) spacefights and deadly dull and insanely low margin wealth bullding methods finally killed my will to log in.

Game dead.

[strike]I've been playing EVE for nearly a decade now. I created my first character back in 2005, but I didn't really truly appreciate the game until I created my second character in 2007. I play primarily from the launcher and not via steam due to how old my accounts are.

 EVE is a game of social politics, economic conquest, and unending warfare. You can do almost anything in EVE, you can be an industrial mogul manufacturing ships and equipment, you can be an unrivaled excavator of valuable resources vital to the unending cycle of creation and destruction, you can be an explorer of the far reaches of the EVE universe's nearly 8000 fully to scale star systems and sell your knowledge of locations and acquired rare goods, you can be a feared combatant of the galaxy of your own cleverness and dedication, conduct truly scandalous acts of ruthless espionage, you can even, as I do, lead and direct truly strategic and tactical combat as a fleet commander.

 In this game, the only limit is your own ambition and will to find what serves you best. I do what I love in EVE. I lead a small guerrilla style force deep into the hearts of the vast player operated nullsec empires; making hit and fade attacks via the game's vast array of ever changing and unconquerable wormhole systems. 

 Many will try to disuade you from your dream in EVE and tell you their less imaginative way is best. They're wrong, your own savvy, acuteness, and will to find your own way are your best assets in this game. EVE favors the bold, but make no mistake though allies are necessary to advance in EVE. This is not a game where you can ignore the universe around you and expect it not to interact with you. If you choose to inhabit this universe and then ignore it, as many do, you will often do so at your own peril. 

 As I said before, the only limit is your own ambition and will to find your way.

First off, given the whole NFT thing going on combined with steam's ruling on NFTs, do not get this on steam. There's a good chance that CCP will refuse to backdown, and steam will likely pull the game. 

With that out of the way, let's start from the beginning. The tutorial is clunky and often explains little, the technically second tutorial consisting of the career agents are ok but are once again lacking, and often, a player will stagnate under the weight of ""What should I do next?"" The game's history as a pay to play subscription game still lingers, with some of the more advanced ships/skills being locked behind Omega state, this game's subscription system. While things like exploration and most pvp/pve can still be done just fine in Alpha state, the F2P version, things like industry, leading corps, shooting rocks, and more are sorely limited.

However, if you can break past that, and commit yourself to do something you enjoy ingame instead of just grinding isk like a job (please help me), then EVE really does hold up to the tall tales many tell about it. There really ARE many opportunities and things to do, to the point where I have been playing for a couple of years (two months on my current main), and I have yet to scratch the surface of many lifestyles provided. I honestly haven't paid for the subscription service yet either simply because I found a balance between something I enjoy doing and something that makes ISK, the ingame currency, so I've been able to just use ISK to pay for omega.

Personal stories aside, the graphics are also pretty great. For all of CCP's failures, the engine/graphics overhaul they did has stood the test of time, and with a good PC you can enjoy the beauty of the game. (Most) of the various ingame activities are fleshed out, and combat is rather intensive and rewarding when you manage to kill someone for the first time. The world really does feel alive due to the efforts of players and the lore you can find throughout the game, although you can just read up about the lore if you don't feel like learning about it ingame.

Overall, if you have the time to spare (like maybe a couple hours a day/week), you want THE sandbox of all sandboxes (in my humble opinion), and you're willing to break through the initial learning curve that is starting out in EVE, then pick up this game for free.

...this will always be my favorite MMO. The community experiences, the heart pounding tension of pvp, watching a careful plan come together in spectacular victory or crushing defeat. No other mmo can match EVE online in the depth of player created content, in my opinion. The learning curve is very steep, but the skill ceiling feels almost infinite.

-----

Eve Online is a game that is entirely what you make of it.

As a new player, the game is staggeringly hard. There's a lot of odd interface choices, the tutorial (such as it is) is basically a joke, and you quickly learn that you have to rely on the help of other players to really have a chance to make it past your first month. I'm not going to lie - this will turn off a lot of new players, and that's OK; not every game appeals to everyone.

However, if you make it past that first month - or if you find yourself a solid player corporation and make some friends - you'll find yourself engaged in a world that is rich in entirely player-made lore, politics, fighting, exploring, mining, building, and constantly learning and working to jointly create a universe with all the other players that stomps any other game's universe into dust and leaves it far behind.

Is Eve a hard game? Yes. Does Eve take patience, and will it frustrate you sometimes? Absolutely on both counts. Is Eve one of the best gaming experiences you can find on the market today? 100%, undoubtedly, yes.

Now come on in, come fly with us, and find your place in this massive New Eden.",1546059733,1640260807,False,0,0,0.50077056884765625,0,True,False,False

that will give you short of security to learn the game ,buy ships do stuff etc,   guess what ,  there is not such thing , it s a game scam to hook you on their loop of addiction by losing.

Do not play if you don't like to think, because that is the core of its unique style. I have limited real time to play games and I have not even reached Eve's end game after many years of playing. That is fine I like playing the lone rogue in a Galaxy of Wars and diplomacy.

 The combat is not mindless point and click you have to prepare and counter the enemy moves be it AI or human. I like the fact that interaction with human players is available even confrontational anywhere but not required to enjoy the game. 

Its a living breathing universe that I enjoy and indulge when I can.

Sometimes it crosses over into real life.

Its my honor to have been a part even on the fringe in a game with the likes of  Sean Smith  AKA vile_rat

In truth, I just got burned out on it.  I still have the account, but will probably let it run out.  It is a huge game, in one sense, very large area to roam around in... YET, not.   

*All the planets look alike (there are I think 5-6 different types), no matter what solar system you go to the planets will be the same.  Maybe a different number of them, maybe a different number of moons (all of which look alike), maybe a little blown up or shrunk down, but always the same. 

*Cyberbullies and Trolls dominate the entire game.  It is a game for and by trolls and cyberbullies, filled with nerd-ragers and narcissistic online sociopaths and psychos. The game rewards this behavior, while providing very little encouragement to be law-abiding or hardworking.  Now lots of people do work hard and grind away, but they are constantly harassed and terrorized (bullied and trolled) by the mobs of asshats who thrive on making people's lives miserable. Indeed, the company (CCP) makes a great deal of money from selling PLEXES (real cash for fake cash), so they have no reason to discourage people from destroying miners, explorers, and industrials at will (forcing players to buy PLEX or just suck it).

*Brown... The background is really ugly, a brownish cast to space.  It seemed pretty at first, but after hours of playing, the brown cast really starts to stand out.

*You are always in a ship, but really you are not even in your ship, you are always looking at it from outside of the ship.  You used to be able to get out, clunkily, in station, to walk a limited distance to a limited cabin, but that's it... and they took this away.  No character-to-character interaction, except as ships out in space, no pubs, no cities... You get the idea: You're a ship, and you don't even get to be inside the ship.   

Anyway, the game is still very addictive, and I have never been able to figure out why.  It's not very fun, most of the time, and indeed, is just downright gloomy and boring and tedious most of the time; yet still it hooked me.

This game is absolutely unique in its class. It is the only PvP heavy MMO with a player driven economy to survive for almost any length of time. The problem is that it's not fun to play. It's intriguing to theory-craft for and it's easy to get absorbed within it.

On the surface, it's close to an idle MMO; you click ""do the thing"" and it does the thing.  Your skills also train whether you're online or not and train twice as fast if you have a subscription so you may want to log in, set things training, then come back in a couple weeks when your character has learned how to fire their gun or missile launcher or mining laser.

There are absolutely situations, however, where you'll be wanting to constantly check tools both in and out of game while coordinating with your corporation/alliance members. Keeping an eye on local numbers and your ship's radar equivalent is common when anticipating an ambush or similar. 

The scale of PvP is also unparalleled, which is one of its greatest strengths and flaws. Large fights easily get into the thousands of pilots. This puts serious strain on even high end computers as well as CCP's servers. Players will turn down graphics to minimum and sound off and still end up getting 5-10 FPS. CCP tries to mitigate the effects of the absurd number of calculations happening by slowing the game down. There is a mechanic called ""time dilation"" where the in-game clock goes slower for your system specifically if there is high activity in it. I have personally been in a situation where a typically 2 minute action (self-destructing to respawn) took me more than 40. There are also some systems that ignore the tick rate, like vulnerability timers for player controlled structures (last I checked). This means you can defend your space by shoving so many bodies on the field that your opponents can't actually fly to you before the vulnerability timer expires. You can also have as many accounts as you want and make a sort of 1 person fleet so deep pockets help there.

The ability to run multiple accounts also allows people to functionally AFK mine all day and make enough in game money to pay for all of their subscriptions. It used to be that PvP could make a dent in this by ships showing up unannounced right on top of the ship. This was known as black ops and, last I checked, they made it nearly impossible to get caught anymore. So the rich whales continue to mine in peace making money for their alliances which are part of coalitions that agreed not to attack each other because they all want to get rich and war is marginally expensive. Bots are the most efficient miners, of course, but bots are also against the Terms of Service. The developers do work to remove these bots but it's not entirely effective, especially when leadership in these larger alliances discourage reporting their bots because, again, that would affect their bottom line.",1635058630,1635058630,False,100,8,0.85948479175567627,0,True,False,False

Just trying to list all the things I love about this game is quite a daunting task.
So in an attempt to actually get a review pushed out the door, I'm just going to dive head-first into it.

[h1] What is EvE ? [/h1]
It's a space-based scifi MMO.
It's one of the last true sandbox MMOs still in operation.
It has good lore and the RP community is wonderful.
There's an insane amount of freedom to be had.
There's alliance level politics that ultimately shape the world of EvE (known as New Eden).
It has the best simulated economy of any game out there.
If you can envision an in-game career or task you would like to pursue, chances are it's out there waiting for you.

[h1] Can it be played solo ? [/h1]
The game can be rewarding for both group-minded players and solo-players alike (the latter of which I belong to).
I almost never gave this game a shot, because I was under the assumption that solo-play was a virtual impossibility. Thanks to the generous time limit of the EvE alpha account (approaching eternity), I was able to get my footing in the game and realize that you can in fact fly completely solo if you so desire.
If anyone out there is reading this, and - like me - is deterred by a perceived requirement to engage with large player groups to get anything done: just know that, with enough determination, you absolutely can forge your own path in this game.

[h1] Path of Least Resistance [/h1]
Even though I prefer flying solo, I feel it's important to mention that a sizeable majority of players in EvE enjoy other pilots' company in small, medium and large groups. Besides the obvious social aspect, there are a plethora of advantages to working together with other pilots in New Eden.
As a new player especially, established groups - however big or small - can provide invaluable advice, guidance and resources that you will be hard pressed to acquire on your own.
For this reason, if you are not particularly opposed to joining a group of players, I would strongly suggest that you make it a priority as soon as you finish the in-game tutorials.

[h1] My general tips for living in New Eden: [/h1]
Actually try the game. There is nothing to lose, since you have access to a free and endless trial account known as an ""Alpha account"". 
Don't fly what you can't afford to lose.
Fly cheap, die often, learn lots.
ISK (in-game currency) comes and goes. Experience is eternal.
Don't let other people define your way of having fun. If you have a dream - chase it.
You don't have to be a hardcore PvPer at heart to play this game. Evading a foe or avoiding certain death can be some of the most exhilarating and rewarding experiences you'll have in this game.
Don't fall for the isk trap (i.e. trying to maximize profits over fun). Hard earned isk can be fun.
If you're not having fun with a particular task, change it up.
If you are having fun with a particular task, don't be afraid to change it up. You never know when you stumble upon a new career path or task you really enjoy.
Try to set long-term goals. This can be difficult in the beginning, but it will eventually help steer you down a path you'll enjoy in the game.
Understand that EvE is played on a single shard/server, so your reputation and actions in the world of New Eden carry real weight. For better or for worse. Also, if you have a persistent negative interaction with another player in the game, just simply block that person. You'll never have to deal with that character again.
Pay it forward; if you come across a genuine new player in EvE, throw some tips and isk their way. Offering advice, linking a high-sec exploration fit or giving them 5 million isk can make all the difference in the world for that person. It happened to me, and here I am today.
Master navigating wormholes and the world (of New Eden) is your oyster.
Praise Bob.

I have been playing this game since it's beta in 2003. I have enjoyed the immersion this game gives you. You can be anyone you want to be in this game. From a simple miner to a capitalist giant, from a pirate to a fleet commander. I have played as a corp CEO to an Alliance Leader!. I have seen Alliances come and go from small to massive, from simple 30 man corps to over 30,000 man Alliances.  This game is so addictive that you tend to loose track of time altogether when playing. The hardest part of Eve now is playing solo. Frankly, I find it really boring playing alone. But once you team up with other players and join a player owned corp/alliance your fun be comes exponentially greater!

I have been apart of a Few major alliance such as CVA - Atlas - Test Alliance Please Ignore just to mention a few and  have loved every moment. In Eve you form lasting relationships with other players. Your true self really shines in this game. 

The graphics in this game are fantastic as long as you have a computer that can handle high definition EVERYTHING. The ship designs are off the chart, from clumsy looking frigates to fantastic Titans! Eve has it all!

The game of eve is like the real world in a sense that you can be whoever you want to be. Want to be the hero? no problem!  Want to be a villain?  well ya you can be that too! The game hosts a wide variety of paths you can take to achieve greatness. I myself strive to be an FC  or Fleet Commander. I enjoy the strategy to overcome the odds and lead my fleets to victory!

Word of caution however. You are playing this game with hundreds of thousands of other players. maybe not all at the same time but a mass of players non the less will be logged into the server 24/7 with the few minutes each day they take the server down for maintenance like 5 to 10 mins most of the time. 

The support staff is very helpful in this game as well. Got a problem you don't know how to fix?  Fire off a report to support and they get back to you within a few hours at most. 

Some of you may have not played this game and think that you will be at to much of a disadvantage to start now. Eve has taken that under consideration and employed skill injectors for in-game purchases. These injectors allow you to ""catch-up"" in the skill race so you can get into that awesome ship sooner and be able to be combat ready instantly! If it's money your lacking in game such as the currency called ISK, have no worries, you can purchase in-game PLEX that you can then sell for game currency to buy all kinds of items and skills!

If you are unsure about playing this game and don't want to spend any money right now, no problem! Eve allows new players to play for free to see what it's all about. Then once you find you like it you can upgrade your account to a per month or a per year. Personally i pay per year as you save on the total cost.

I look forward  to seeing you all in game and if you are on the fence just give it a try!  Good luck!",1632782091,1632782091,True,19,1,0.625316739082336426,0,True,False,False

I keep coming back because it's truly unique, there's no other game like it. It's huge, with 7,000 solar systems split between high security, low security, zero security and wormhole space. It's a risk/reward type of game. The more risk there is in whatever you're doing, the higher the potential reward. For example, in high security space, you can take your little starter mining ship (the Venture) and mine some Veldspar or some Scordite, which can be found anywhere, but you're never going to get rich from it because there's very little risk in high security space, and an ore hold full of Veldspar might sell for 200,000 credits. Take that Venture in to low security space however - where players can (and will) kill you if they find you - and the potential rewards are about 10 times higher, with an ore hold full of Kernite or Omber selling for 5 million credits if you make it back alive.

So what do you do in EVE Online? Well, it's a total sandbox. You do literally whatever you feel like doing that day, and although it can take months (or even years) to train the skills to become fully proficient in one activity you can actually start doing almost all of it on your very first day in the game. Want to become an industrialist? Simply do the industry tutorial and you'll get a Venture to mine asteroids very quickly and can buy a cheap blueprint to manufacture a popular type of ammunition that players will always need. Want to do PvE? Simply do the military tutorial, get yourself a decent frigate, fit it with some guns and some basic defences and begin doing level 1 security missions. Exploration? There's a tutorial for that, it'll give you a basic exploration ship and teach you how to begin scanning cosmic signatures to find data and relic sites with valuable loot to sell. PvP? Literally just get in a frigate and go to low security space. Don't worry about finding another player - eventually one will find you. Join a corporation and fleet up if you're worried about PvP'ing with low skills.

Last thing I'd like to mention is the economy. This is another area where EVE Online is truly unique. Almost everything you buy and sell is manufactured, bought from, and sold to another actual, living player. Ships, guns and ammunition don't just appear out of thin air - another player has to mine the asteroids to acquire the materials to manufacture them, then put them on the market for you to buy. If you do PvE and come back with a cargo hold full of loot, you can only sell it because other players have created buy orders for those items. If they haven't then you can't sell it - you have to leave it in your station gathering dust or reprocess it in to minerals and sell those instead (minerals which other players will then use to manufacture other stuff for other people to buy). The economy in EVE Online is like the real world economy. It was designed to be.

Despite what you might have heard about it being a tough, unforgiving game, it has the friendliest and most helpful playerbase of any game I've ever played, which is good because you'll need a lot of help and advice when you first start playing. Back in 2008 when I first began, I got so much help from people that I never actually bothered to leave the rookie help channel - I'm still there 13-years later passing on that help to the new players of today.",1632380041,1632380041,True,50,1,0.817268252372741699,2,True,False,False

This. Game. Is. Epic.

With the addition of free to play alpha grade clones essentially an unlimited limited trial you can jump in face first and climb the learning curve with new in game tools that do away with the long historically laughed at and feared inverted learning curve that came with this game.

To begin with, the new player experience has been massively improved. The free account restrictions have been lifted slightly, and these days free accounts can thrive in the game so long as they pursue active incomes. Passive incomes are severely limited as a downside, because CCP permits and encourages alternate characters and accounts and the economy would break if hundreds of free account characters could make tens of millions of isk a day from passive income.

Rampant trolls had ruined the experience for me back in 2014, but in 2021? Ironically because of a recent departure of many players from the game, there seems to be a significantly smaller presence of trolls in the game. You're much less likely now to get destroyed by someone who dedicates their playtime to griefing other players.

Content has been expanded and revised multiple times since I last touched the game. Mining is still pretty much the same (if anything changed, it would be the meta used for mining). PvE is pretty rewarding, though the missions are set up in somewhat annoying manners that made half the missions not enjoyable. I didn't try exploration but at a glance it's been thoroughly fleshed out, but unfortunately it seems the bulk of the griefers in the game focus on explorers.

Now, the reason I decided not to dedicate my time to the game, and uninstalled it: I realized if I got into the game I would be spending most of my time, spending most of my time..

Missions had me going to other systems for objectives and CCP has intentionally crippled the autopilots system so that it leaves you as a sitting duck for griefers every few seconds. This forces you to manually jump from system to system, which gets old really fast this can take many minutes and involves just opening a context menu and selecting the same option ever few seconds.

Combat had a similar problem, strangely. You lock onto a target and tell however many turrets/missiles to shoot at the target, then wait until it dies. I actually got up for drinks a number of times during this, there wasn't really any action or excitement going on, just a lot of waiting. After the 50th battle, this got unsurprisingly old.

Lastly the skill system. Yeah, it sort of makes sense that you'd have to learn how to operate drones or fire large missile launchers, but these things can take real-life WEEKS to do. I found myself craving the progression of Elite Dangerous where I was focused on finding profits, not staring at a time that said something like ""6d 10h 45m remaining"".

So to conclude my review: The game is good, well-developed, and run by a company that cares about its community. This shows and I HIGHLY recommend anyone with an interest in sci-fi games to give it a try. For myself, though, I found that the content was poorly engaging and almost seemed aimed at making me spend my time waiting for timers to end rather than actively participating in the world. The intentionally-busted autopilot system is just an absolute annoyance that I wish they would finally remove (I know it's been in the game for over a decade, at least), I'd rather be able to focus my attention on a youtube video during long routes instead of focusing on the game so I can right-click the same spot on the screen over and over again. This just drove me to boredom with the game even faster.",1400978994,1629160989,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

But now...

It feels like a pyramid scheme.
Let me explain why.

Without Omega time, you cant do much. To omega your steam account it costs 15 euro a month.
I had two older accounts and decided to activate them again. I found out that payment can only be done via Steam. So for my steam account I can pay 15 euro directly for omega time, but for the other two accounts I had to buy 500 Plex for each additional account, which is 20 euro's for each additional account. That was a big punch to my wallet (monthly gaming budget).

Sure I thought, I can buy Plex ingame for earned ISK, which surely is feasible, right?...
So... I reckoned, planet industry and Relic hunting (in nullsec), should be enough right?

Translated this means I had to generate 1.5 billion ISK for each account to save myself 55 euros a month. So 4.5 billion ISK in total. 

The reason why I have 3 accounts is that I wanted to actively train a fighter pilot pve/pvp character, a logistics and capital pilot to support said fighter pilot and an industrial character for some financial backbone options. Trust me it makes sense, especially back in the days when you couldn't train multiple pilots on one account.

THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU INVEST TO GENERATE 4.5 BILLION ISK EACH MONTH... As a returning player.... IS INSANE...
Think 2-3 hours a day Relic hunting (in Sansha nullsec) and doing planet industry with 4 characters, which means 1-2 hours of work every 3 days (including losses due to the nature of 0.0) would get me above 4.5 bill ISK a month..
That's 16-25 hours of work a week (best to worst Relic hunting RNG)... And those activities are not enjoyable. Who wants to scan mostly cherrypicked (already looted) relic sites for hours on end? Ugh >_<

I feel literally working my ass off for scraps, as if I'm in the bottom rung of a pyramid scheme...
You begin for fun, then you find the promise of money/ISK, you put in way too many hours to achieve this, and thanks to your efforts (grunt work) the economy sustains itself. In essence, you're working for a game while not having fun, in effort to be able to have fun in the end but only sometimes.... Sounds like the real life trap....
The alternative is paying 55 euros a month (for me, 3 accounts) for a game.... No thanks...

And then some additional things I noticed.

1) Since the introduction of wormholes (the reason why i left) the eve-universe doesn't feel coherent anymore to me and still feels that way. Everyone and their mother (the industrial types) are finding wormholes to live in. It makes most space feel barren in my opinion.

2) NPC controlled nullsec, especially Syndicate and Stain are filled with Russians from what I've seen. There's no hi, hello or natural banter, only cyrillic texts in local, and when you translate that, its only toxic huff and puff (my personal experience).. So be prepared in certain regions that this game has the same level of toxicity and saltiness as many other online games.

3) There's something called Scarcity going on, which as far as I know means that CCP (the devs) are trying to drain the inflated economy (the rich need to be less rich). This results in bizarre pricing on certain products which doesn't help new or returning players. For example: I used to buy a battleship for about 100-150 million ISK back in the day, but that's 350+ million ISK now...

4) The introduction of Skill point Injectors.
I'm guilty of this too, bought a few to get my steam account character going for relic site hunting.... But in hindsight, this is purely grabbing as much money from players that they can and is an insult to older characters who worked so hard and spend so much time, dedication and patience to evolve to get where they are now..... Only to be taken over or being just as good by character less then a month old.... Because in real life there are whales (wealthy people) and can spend thousands of Plex (hundreds of euros/dollars) on skill injectors.... The love and respect for older characters are gone... Which is also the major reason why older players are quitting Eve-online from what I've heard (on steam eve-online charts the concurrent players dropped from 5.5-6k to just above 4K players in 3 months time)

This may be a biased review, but these are my personal experiences and view on Eve-online.

Summary:

- The glory days of eve-online are gone (pre-wormhole expansion) and I don't expect them to come around again with the way the devs/management are currently milking this game.
- If you LOVE space games, then this is still the best space mmo out there.
- If you do want to play this game then I will advise you to start off with friends and/or make friends ASAP. You will need their guidance, help, and network to gain a foothold outside of high-sec where in my opinion all the fun is.
- This game will cost you a fair amount of money and will try to get you spending more... Otherwise be prepared to stick in a lot of time to be able to play for free.

This is coming from a player who was the CEO of a 150 man corp and was one of three leaders of a 400 people alliance based in the providence region back in 2010-2012.

Feels and hopes:
Eve online how it is today feels like an amazing and beautiful automobile which is running on 4 flat tires.
Why? because the game diluted itself too much with too many vague activities in my opinion with a jaded economy.

I yearn for a new eve, Eve-online 2.0, which does focus on its strengths, high-sec as learning ground, direct goals for mining/production with the end result of vying for 0.0 control and it's resources and no wormholes... The big battles, busting gatecamps, taking down POSses with affordable big ships, stories to be made and told... the difference between manpower, assets and tactics. The push and pull. But now, it feels like if you rat some npc's in 0.0 someone could just cyno a Titan on you, because there are too many Titans around, just for laughs....",1627734381,1627738344,False,122,7,0.831385135650634766,8,True,False,False

The UI itself is a barrier to entry for new players and many of the things that ppl could call ""fun"" are hard to even know how to get into if you don't look up wikis and youtube videos. While that's not an inherently bad thing, it does make it difficult for EVE to attract and grab the attention of new players.

 It's a ""game"" like no other and because of that it is pretty controversial and the playerbase is constantly at odds with themselves and CCP about what changes the game needs to keep things fun and fresh. I won't talk about any of those changes here though because to a new player things like ""resource scarcity"" and ""cloaking reworks"" don't mean anything to them. You'll see a lot of negative reviews from players with >10 hrs of gameplay and others who have 1,000+ hrs and still leave a negative review due to their favorite feature having been changed recently.

It's one of those games that you can play for 500 hours and still only scratch the surface. Many might argue that is because you have to ""grind"" boring activities such as mining or npc missions to earn ISK (in-game currency). While there are definitely some more ""low-speed"" activities in EVE, there is such a variety of what you can do that I promise you there is something for everyone. 

At it's core EVE is an MMO and it is an inherently social experience. You can play completely on your own but I would argue you miss out on what makes the game enjoyable. The living sandbox. While there are a lot of things that EVE isn't the best at, I'm confident in saying that it is the best MMO sandbox that I have ever experienced and for that I keep coming back. I'll probably reach a point where i take a break from EVE again as i have many times over the past decade. But until another game can create a better MMO sandbox experience in a sci-fi setting I'll likely continue to find my way back to EVE again and again.",1624291376,1624291376,True,3,0,0.526980698108673096,0,True,False,False

They literally changed the game so much during the last 2 years that all the time I spent skilling my characters in all those freakking years got flushed in the toilet because they are - not kidding - way overskilled and too many characters to get the job done because, thanks to all their changes to industry and especially mining, there's very little they can do for all the skills they have simply because... they do it too extremely good (I know it's difficult to understand, but that's the reality of what this game as come to be now). 12 accounts and 36 alts retired after a lifetime, which sounds and in fact is, totally crazy, even to think about, that in the past you would need so many to king your way in the industry panorama but hey when you're lifeless...; fun fact is: now that you need less, there's nothing to do anyway because there's literally nothing to mine and nothing can be built at decent prices, so either you open your wallet wider than your wife's legs on your first wedding night, or you gotta live with the scraps and the mirage of one day achieving anything great yourself. They ruined the in-game economy with the very infamous and unbalanced Rorqual's rework that got left mostly untouched for 6 years and THEN came up with major changes to building requirements into blueprints this year instead of 6 months after the aforementioned capital mining rework. Why? Very frakkking simple: because at the same time they came out with injectors (skill points boosters) and rode HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGH AS FRAAAAKKK that wave of new and old players that came into the game to get rich and dirty in the quickest possible way aka Rorqual mining; quick fast-forward to today: there's almost nothing to mine anymore because CCP in their uttermost knowledge and wisdom thought that it was a smart idea to actually get rid of every possible mineable resource or make it near impossible or make it an extremely tedious and time-wasting activity or make it extremely risky, and I'm just talking abt the regular stuff that you would find around everywhere in any classical game, the ABC resources... to fix the in-game economy!!! That THEY ruined in the first place!! Now, take a moment for yourself and imagine how good is everything else in the game....  This game used to be like this (and reasonably): time invested + will to waste your life * account = $$$ in-game to have fun. Now it is: time invested + how big is your wallet * account = you're being milked and to not have fun. It's full of bots, and if it wasn't for players reporting them, CCP would never even care about them. Its tutorials are still the same complex, convoluted, unfinished, unpolished and bugged trash that were years ago, sure they made some progress they were even worse 10 years ago... There are quite a consistent amount of people asking for a rework of Factional Warfare (FW: it's a pvp+pve aspect of the game where you side with 1 of the 4 empires to fight for) from... 9 years? And still waiting! The place is full of bots that milk loyalty points (FW rewards to turn into items to sell 4 ingame currency) day and night ruining the whole economy around the system itself and making it pointless to actually participate because all your efforts are wasted by other players' bots. CCP literally pushes updates that ruin the game in under 24 hours from their test server without collecting or even listening to feedback, while QoL or stuff for the greater good of the game in the long run doesn't get addressed FOR YEARS. Y-E-A-R-S. Let me say that again: it takes them 10 years at a time to just come up with a fix to something that is a cancerous game mechanic, the economy itself, the gameplay around something used or in most cases abused by players, and I could really go on and on and on. CCP's mindset can be summarized like this: there's a skin for ships ingame which is very cool, makes your ship look like a police ship with blue and red lamps on top of it, and you would say ""cool let me have it!"" but noooope. Why? because of their fascist elitist mentality: it was available long time ago but only for a restricted amount of time. I mean seriously, how fraaaaking counter intelligent and how much counter productive to your business can you be by not making something cool that everyone wants available to everybody and that you can make money out of too? Which btw is also one of the few skins that deserve money because their art department 11 times out of 12 comes out (every week now) with a new skin that looks absolutely trash, and that you have to buy multiple times too because it applies only to one single ship out of... 300+? BTW nevermind the community that came out with much cooler skins for the ships, CCP keeps saying their stuff is of higher quality: dark coloured skins for ships with dark space background. Golfclap. I'm not kidding, you like this game, especially in the state it is? you've got issues. Seek counseling.

Coming to cosns, this game has devoloped into a pay to win path. Whereas 2 years ago living in your own pocket of dangerous space could make you enough money just to pay for your subscription with in game currency, CCP made sure, that this is no longer an option. And with a lot less of disposable income to use for new ships you can throw at your adversaries - remember this thing is a full loot no safe zone PvP game - this ultimately comes down to who can afford more supers and this is a wallet thing, or super high ingame investment. 

Coming to new player friendlyness: 
First: you are broke. This limits your options. 
Second: You dont have any skills, which makes you deal no damage and die faster. 
Third: Whan you die, this costs you ingame money. And CCP made sure you can't really compensate for that and you have to pay up real money.
Forth: There are entire Troll-Corporations that take pride in making the life of newbros miserable.

EVE is an extremely unique game with so many things to do its practically the definition of THE space game let alone an mmorpg, but being around for such a long time has made many of the systems start to cave in on themselves.

---THE GOOD---
-Extremely detailed world and content with hours upon hours of cool things to see and do.

-Player driven to a fault with literal history books people have written about events that took place between players.

-Open ended with many many paths to take all of them having so much to learn about that each one could be a game itself.

-Fittings (ship equipment and modules) that are extremely customizable to nearly any need you can think of.

-Strategic combat that is more indepth than it seems.

-Unique artstyle that many a game has tried to mimic.

-Surprisingly good graphics that have been updated and enhanced over the years.

-Interesting lore although this is a tad bit weaker than the other aspects of the game.

-Everything is player made from the smallest components to the largest battleships people have spent time mining resources and crafting blueprints to make the economy work.

-Player run nations with their own ""politics"" and wars


---THE BAD---

-Skill points.... a system originally made to let people who cant no life the game keep up with anyone who could that has spiraled out of control with years upon years of new content and skills making new players have to relive the wait and real money expense of said years to be able to join in on any of the interesting content.

-Isk (in game currency) this wouldnt be a downside if it was the only measurement of progress but having a classical grind alongside the pay real money and wait system (Skillpoints) it turns into a grindy timesink.

-The veteran playerbase. again this wouldnt usually be a downside but in eves case the old time players have a certain ""been there done that you can too"" attitude to new players and their experiences, in many cases being at least 6 years into the game they have lost touch with what its like to try and catch up with the horribly crushing systems the game forces new players to grind and wait through as such the community is extremely elitist at the best of times and extremely petty at the worst.

-Community tools. i like that they exist. i dont like that they are needed to play the game. (the shear number of old github pages and dead wiki links is infuriating at the best of times)

-Repetitive. in an almost survival game sense... once you have done it a few times and learnt the quirks of a system it doesnt ever change again only ever getting replaced or moved to a new shiny backdrop to do whatever it was that you were doing before again.

-Solved. the game has a crippling meta addiction thats somewhat softened by the rock paper scissors approach to combat but combined with the veteran playerbase that has many of the skillpoints to fly almost any side of the rock paper scissors it becomes a shear zerg fest of the ""best"" ships.

-For the risk averse this game will be nothing but an asteroid clicker simulator.

-As much as i liked the idea of a no rules mmo the shear number of people that will dismiss new players because ""OH MY THEY MIGHT BE A SPY OR THIEF"" is absurd but warranted in that climate.

---Personal note about my path---
I made my way as a solo explorer and mild pvp dabbler mostly operating out of random hostile nullsec or WH space but i flew practically anywhere there was isk to be made, i tried joining many a corporation (Highsec, lowsec, nullsec and wormhole corps) only to find extreme elitism and an almost anti fun attitude i decided such a life wasnt for me. i made about 2 billion isk in my first 2 months playing the game through rare salvage and general multi mil cans, npc bounties, trading, jita camping (being a scanner for hire so to say), looting large corp battlefields for expensive components. hell even thought about selling information on the whereabouts of large corp assets as i had a bit of a talent for getting through bubbles. but in the end i always was so far behind the curve that no matter how much i learnt or tried it felt as if the game didnt want to be played.

----

The developers have, over the course of the past couple years, slowly made the game more and more... undesirable to many people.

I do not fault them for remaining true to ""permanent loss"" being a central game mechanic. However, they've just been... amplifying this quality. Slowly creeping up the difficulty everywhere. Making it not only more difficult to recover from loss, but too difficult to even reach a position where you could lose something substantial in the first place.

Some examples over the recent years include:
- Made mining riskier and less profitable across the board. It's just disproportionately high risk to low reward now.
- Made manufacturing stuff take longer and be more of a pain.
- Made owning structures even more expensive and riskier.
- Made owning structures less profitable (in conjunction with hard-nerfing mining).
- Made gankers progressively more powerful. Usually, this tactic is used against mining vessels. 
- Made mining ships more fragile than they already are and have less defensive properties. Yep. Gankers never had any problems before these changes. Did I mention they made this change in conjunction with the above one?
- Worse than doing nothing- have encouraged and sided with toxic behavior.
- Encourages CODE's extortionist and anti-casual behavior, both actively and indirectly. I mean, ha ha, funni meme there CODE, but you stopped being funny years ago. Seriously, I can't believe the founder James 315 is still posting salt stories on his website a decade later.
- The promises of ""player-driven"" have died. Eve was more player-driven five years ago than it is now.

So yea, 500 hours is ""casual"" and still isn't enough. It has become increasingly more impossible for any new players to get into Eve Online. Only the people who've played for years already can enjoy/thrive in it.",1619626864,1620698656,False,30,2,0.724043548107147217,0,True,False,False

Yes, ships have been rebalanced, new ships and mechanics added. Features added and removed. But Eve itself hasn't changed too much. It's not for the faint of heart, but those who stick with it, will be greatly rewarded.

I would also like to respond to those who complain about Omega clones: Until Omega became a thing, the *only* way you could play Eve Online was by subscription. The only ""Free"" option was a 14 (sometimes 25) day trial. There were no Alpha states. It's not a ""paywall""; they literally gave a way for players to enjoy the game without having to pay the monthly fee. And if you're smart with an Alpha clone? You can do an awful lot with an Alpha clone, from what I've learned, including faction cruisers!

Doing anything of substance in this game takes TIME. It takes REAL TIME to learn the skills necessary for you to pilot spacecraft. Want to get into a Maelstrom? Will probably take you at least a month or two. Want to get into a TITAN? That could be a YEAR or more. That part has mostly to do with doing your research on what skills to train and... TIME. There's nothing you can do about the time part unless you want to inject your character with skills (apparently - but I know nothing about that), and for the higher stuff you have to be subscribed to even train those skills.

Now that we've talked about the payment thing, I think that if you're playing this seriously it is EXPECTED that you're subscribed.

This game is beautiful, but its aesthetic is not as cartoony as NMS. It plays more like an RTS game than NMS and Elite: Dangerous. You're not in the cockpit. You target things through clicking menus on the UI and activate appropriate things on your ship to deal with them at the bottom of your screen where there's a nice MMO-like HUD to interact with.

Ships can be built to specialize in many things. Mining, piracy, missions, exploration, etc. This game has a heavy focus on PvP. Unlike NMS you actually get stuff for killing people. This game is not for the feint of heart, and NMS players are notoriously passive. They will hate that about this game because they hate the fact that there's PvP in NMS. Pansies, the lot of them. Don't play this if you aren't willing to lose something from time to time. You're going to die, and you're going to lose your ship. It's a matter of when that happens.

This is the most realistic space experience you can get from a social aspect. Anything legendary that happened in an Online Space Game happened in EVE Online. Not NMS, not Elite: Dangerous. In EVE Online, guilds (corporations) matter. People actually try to infiltrate them as spies and gain advantages for wars. You won't find that in many other games - I can think of none off the top of my head. This is all because when you die... You LOSE something. That's part of the bitter beauty of how this game is set up.

Yes... It's spreadsheets, grindy, subscription pretty much required, and time-gated. The F2P thing is just so you can get a taste and see if you like it. I don't have that much time in this game, and I've only been subscribed when it was a free promotion. I have a Hurricane and did some missions... I enjoyed it, but I'm an achievement hunter and this doesn't really have any so I've decided to put time elsewhere :D

This is a great game but to be great at it you really do have to dedicate yourself to it and do some research. There's a lot of paths you can go but you must pick since it's time-gated. It is literally like a second career in that respect. Not for everyone, but is definitely for the dedicated space enthusiast.",1310269745,1620496337,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even at that point you could mine and build ships to sell, explore and occasionally pvp if you wanted to or got caught. The thrill of being on field with 3 rorqs when enemies start dropping on grid was exhilarating.
Now, it has turned into a forced pvp game where you lose more money than you can make. Abyssal sites for those that want to jump on for an hour and do something, which gets very boring after the 3rd one or so. They heavily nerfed mining and other prosperous activities as well as capital ships to the point where I sold 3 rorqs and a nyx because they were useless now. Why have billions of dollars on field to make only a few hundred million? EVE has turned into a cash shop that is starting to fill with wallet warriors.
For the critics. I don't mind the pvp and going on roams with your corp is fun as hell. However, I do not wish to do that time and time again every logon. I am not as goods as most when it comes to pvp and that is okay but even then I could no longer make up my lost isk by other means in order to buy more pvp ships.

thumbs down yes. not because of the pve pve is great and with friends too but.

People have no brain in PVP all they want is kill kill kill......I mean yes it is a PVP game but player versus player don't mean just to kill each other FFS 

let me explain

I am a single venture no weapon, not even a damn drone to attack. my ship cost around 12 million( i explore wormhole and don't want to lose too much when i die) all alone mining enjoying the loneliness and then bam 5 drones AI-controlled appear i don't hesitate i warp away and go back home to get my Gila (500% medium drone damage will do the shit. like i thought i rekt them, salvage them, go back home and get back on the venture.

i start mining when out of nowhere i see a heron spawn i didn't hesitate and warp away but at the same moment realize it was a real player in a -1.0 wormhole he can come from anywhere.

so i wait a few minutes then go back to mine (the heron was not there anymore) when 10 minutes later i see the same heron appears like 60 km away from me he starts coming at me but slow so i tell my self maybe we can chat and be friendly even have is cover to help me ( i would have paid few mil isk for that you know friendly play)so i try to start a chat convo saying hi friend(like you know this game is not just about killing each other in my book we can freaking talk you know) but nooooo this mf rejected my conversation and start coming hot at me so with some hesitation i decided to warp out but this MF is on me in 4 seconds like okay he fast and this damn invention they call warp disruptor or canceller (WHATEVER THEY CALL THIS DUMB INVENTION) block you from moving and warping away and like i said earlier i don't have a weapon or fighting drone.

So now this idiot all he wants is to kill me so i abandon ship and leave the place and my venture explodes i didn't care about the ship by the way or the 12 mill i spend on it no. what i did care is of this guy killing me, me a venture no weapon just minding my self and mining some ore to pay something to continue my fun and trip in this nice universe. and then this guy made me realize how humanity is so fuck top now. hurting and killing each other is the only fun you have these days. this game could be so much more but all i get is a player like this heron who just fuck up my fun in doing no-brain play.

so that's why my thumbs down this game is fun but it is a big grinder game and i still search for nice players but I've seen more bad brain players than good brain players.

[b] What I Liked [/b]

So there have been a ton of space MMOs out there.  I have tried them all.  In the end, I feel EVE Online won the space race.  Why?  Because of all you could do in the game.  Like PvP?  This has it in spades.  Like a full fledged player run economy?  This is great for that.  Want to explore?  There is so much to explore in this game it isn't even funny.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

Shooting at dots.  For the most part that's what combat can be, depending on the ship and weapons you use.  You are shooting at dots.  It's a great game for the combat, but, shooting long distance doesn't mean you will see what you are shooting at in space.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

I got my fill out of it.  I was never good at the combat, so I tried playing the market.  That was simply incredible.  I was buying low, selling high, hiring players to move goods for me, etc.  I felt like I had my own trade empire going, and it was great.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!

Been with it for a heck of a long time so much so the that steam's recorded hours doesn't properly reflect it. One thing I noticed is that no one can properly pitch this game to a non-EvE player or even talk about it outside of the game, other than what I've been defaulting to is that if you wanna play eve it's gotta be a second job at the very least to experience what there is to offer. Thing is for sure it's one of the least welcoming games out there now more than ever, not unless you wanna bend over for someone else just so their line men and be allowed to live in their space or get you teeth knocked down your throat trying until the game breaks you or you finally bend over and join a group of people you really don't know who are more than willing to promise everything just so they have another body to field. For all of the claims that it's a open ended game is really just a rigid game. What I mean by rigid is the fact this sucker has been around for a long time, meaning all of the players who stuck around and were smart enough to build these power bases, wealth, and influence are the ones who control EvE in the day to day. Though space politics aside because it's about as fun to talk about as drowning yourself the game isn't going anywhere at least from my point of view, living in all the various spaces from the High Sec all the way to C6 space (Spooky Wormholes) with a good amount of time spent in each. Yeah when I first started this game was bumping off the chain, still remember rolling around with BNI when we were at war with AAA (All Against Authority) but now that everyone who sticks around has learned this game like the back of their hand I don't see any real progress, strife or real consequence this game once ran with. CCP's flavor of the week doesn't really affect the player base, not as much as they claim it says it does. We've become comfortable with the Dev's work to the point its okay when the way of life is messed with, guess it's time to retool our kits and just find another way so really no harm is done in the long term. Of course we got the season whiners but they are only known cause they are the idiots who couldn't adapt or were to stupid to see the writing on the wall. All in all this game turned into a swamp with CCP sitting comfy as they collect that sub money unless your willing to spend a good portion of your day making money in game so you don't but don't let anyone tell you that you can play subscribed for free, your time is worth something and plexing your account or accounts takes a lot of that time.

This game was the single most invested I've ever gotten in game in my life. I can't comment on the current state, because I don't play anymore. It's a space sandbox with territorial control. Graphics are still great after all these years because they continue to update them. You want a player run economy....you have it. You want pvp...plenty of it to go around. You want to chill out and mine, you can do that too. The rewarding gameplay is there if you put the time and effort into it. Yeah it's a spreadsheet heavy game because of the complexity of the game. Any game with enough complexity will do that. It doesn't have to be that though. It is what you make of it.

Work, eat, play, sleep, repeat....for 6 months. That was my time in null sec. I was part of a corp which joined an alliance that controlled some null sec space for about 6 months. I'm mostly a pve player...so I took up the role of mining director for the corp. The small time industrialist. I mined null sec for about 5 months. I helped defend our space. I went out on patrols. I went on alliance ops to fight on the other side of the map for allies.

Ultimately, the alliance collapsed, and I was stuck in null sec with the Charon I had built there. I was working on making it a Jump freighter, but it was taking too much time. So I loaded up what I could in the Charon, and parked it in a station...then started scanning for wormholes. It took me 2 weeks to find it, but I found a wormhole big enough with a link another wormhole that had a link to low sec. The Porkchop Express survived the trip, collapsing wormholes on the way, and is parked in a high sec station to live out it's life.

The economy on the other hand has more spreadsheet appeal than working at one of those gigantic American corporate accounting firms...   If you would call that appeal.

The skill system is their major cock-block mechanic, forcing you to keep paying that pilots license for Years before you can move up to the big ships.

So yes, you have a ""character"" that you ""equip gear"" to and that gear does stuff. This part of the game is exactly identical in every way to any other game that you equip gear in. Otherwise, it's space. It's big. You move fast and hit/carry/dig/heal hard. all the weapons, all the ships, all the space. 
The biggest major difference between this and other space games is that you ""play a ship captain."" So when  you click to do move/shoot/etc, you ""tell the helmsman/weapons officer/etc"" to do the thing, then he does. it takes a second for your inputs to do something. this is intentional and the core of why this game is great. 
You have to constantly maintain situational awareness and adapt. sure, when you star it's mostly ""click orbit and fire"" but after level 0 missions that ends and manual piloting becomes the most important part of flying, the game just takes you in baby steps. 
Lastly, test server if free. Log in and test your ships if you've never tried [the thing] before.

From casual mining, to challenging combat sites, to in depth- industry, Eve has a niche for many fans of the genra. With all this being said, there are a few downsides.
Pros- customizable loadouts (fittings) for each ship to help make each function best for you

- many different ship types, sizes, and roles to choose from, from logistics (support) ships, to covert opps scout ships, to drone controllers,  there are a huge amount of ships to choose from.

- in depth industry: train into a mining specialist and help bring in raw materials for you group, experiment with ""reactions"" to change useless materials into better ones, or become a manufacturing giant and build everything you could ever need. Open your own station to refine, craft, and sell almost anything.

-player run economy: most items are made by players, bought by players, and sold by players. as such markets fluctuate realistically with the potential for resale in other regions.

Cons:
-Social based game: A large amount of the content in this game hinges on teamwork and co-operation. perfect if you have a group looking for a good game to get into, challenging if your going in alone. several ships and now some materials are only available in highly dangerous territories that need an experianced team to navigate, and much of those dangerous areas are already patrolled by larger groups.

- Time consuming/Slow start: This game has a HUGE skill system to help each player specialize in various areas. this skill system is based on real time, and while there are skill boosters and accelerators to help speed up the wait, you will likely be waiting months to train into the larger ships. (or spending ALOT of real money to boost)

- PVP everywhere: while there are ""safe"" areas, no matter where you go it is possible to be attacked by other players and you can potentially lose everything except your skills. (you used to lose some skills as well, this has been removed) players looking to own there own station risk it being attacked and destroyed, usually with a total loss of all stored items inside. ships are never fully replaced, even if u buy the max insurance.
There are groups of players who actively hunt down casual players (like miners) so there is every chance you could lose your ship no matter what you are doing.",1614001176,1614001176,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game itself is a climb and admittedly the initial climb is the steepest of all and is not for most people or even most of my friends, but that is completely fine with me, because this game will not cater to you, it'll make you earn everything. The game has drastically improved the beginner experience over the years but it still makes no apologies to those who cannot be bothered to grow or learn on their own without the game telling them what to do or which direction to go. 

When you enter EvE you accept that PvP will be ""on"" all the time even when you are doing PvE activities. Players will attempt to group up and gank you even in High security space in cheap high damage suicide ships if you fly through their space in something expensive. Players actively PvP on the global market through trade battles. More efficient mining corporations will mine out entire belts before you have the opportunity to even mine there that day. So even when you are not actively shooting another player, you are still PvPing. 

Ship to Ship PvP is a chess match in space. You need a working knowledge of not only the ships in the game but their most likely ""fit"" or how the player will choose to customize the ship. Not knowing this will most likely result in you dying.... a lot. There are tons of resources out there to help you learn such things before you ever engage your first player and when you do engage a player and you turn them into a burning wreck and loot their ship because your fit and your piloting was better. It is possibly the highest high you will ever feel in a PvP game and suddenly you will be hooked.... forever. 

Does the game have toxicity, 100%, most highly competitive games do. If you're looking for sympathy though, expect it to be scarce, and if you enter a game made by devs who have songs on their official youtube page named ""Killing is Just a Means of Communication"" and ""HTFU"" you have only yourself to blame if you get your feelings hurt because PvP happened in a PvP game. 

With that said I have become friends with people from other continents in this game that I talk to out of game and if you are genuinely interested in learning the game and are humble you will find someone to teach you. There are also corps in the game (EvE Uni, Brave Newbies) that will take you day 1 and help mold you into a solid pilot and give you some direction.

Everything in how it was designed lets you be free in your choices, do whatever content you want or just hang around and chat, sit on the market to make money or choose between PvE/PvP. 

There is a huge learning curve for sure, on top of that a game that allows the player freedom is bound to have some drawbacks with trolls and such but even then, spend some time and you'll figure out how to avoid those encounters. The amount of content is massive and getting bored of one just means you can choose to do another. 

Eve isn't a microtransaction game, the value of ships has an equivalent to irl money like most games, you buy something to get your currency, buy a ship, figure out the rate and there you have a ship irl value. The first month or two, having Omega (premium time that increases training speed and unlocking higher tier skills) speeds up your progress by a lot, after that it's quite easy to make enough money to buy Plex which can be exchanged for premium time. 

This game is incredibly deep, economy, manufacturing, politics between players, it's so easy to get lost in the world. Having little time to play isn't always an issue either, with skill training being irl time based regardless if you are logged in means you can constantly progress even whilst on a break. Money can be more difficult to earn but the right skills trained and good knowledge of what activities you enjoy lead to you being able to earn money in almost every aspect of the game. You can buy Plex to exchange for ingame money which can help boost your enjoyment but ultimately the game will only give you what you put into it. It's like every other game in that sense.

Ok so this game was my all time favourite but since the nerf to mining, introducing p2w skill injectors and moving mainly into the pvp style game and less of a pve. Look this game is still good if your after that p2w pvp style game play but personally its not for me. just for logging in you get a battle ship as a gift where when i started playing in 2007 (official launcher) it took months IRL to work your way into bigger ships and it was a achievement to pilot one. now days you can buy your way into a carrier. when i last payed a player got into a carrier (new toon) within 3 days. before skill injectors it took 1-3 years to pilot one which made it special when one showed up on a battle field. Anyways thats my unfiltered opinion

8500,81867590,76561198024087514,0,14,16027,0,16027,1588782607,"Okay, so this isn't my first review or product that I have a problem with. 


First off, Eve online's description on the steam store is that you can choose your own path from 'countless options' but here's the reality. 

As a new player, you cannot immediately jump into a mining ship or a bomber and start doing things. To start off, you have to select the place on the skill tree you want to go before going to it, and usually what you can 'hop into' at level one is a rickety low budget spacecraft in which you can maybe earn 1-5m an hour, when ships on the tree itself past level 3 cost tens or hundreds of millions for anything outside of basic stuff. 

And as for Eve being 'free?' Really. An income per hour gate is 'free'. The inability to achieve the same results as a paying player is by its definition (And I hate using this phrase because it's demeaning) pay to win. In short, if you want to make any form of income that is decent enough to replace what you've spent on a ship you need to expect to spend multiple hours to gain it back should something happen to it. 

As for 'risk/reward' Hmm..I can earn probably in high sec 40-50m an hour with the best premium stuff and never risk death (Or very rarely). I can triple that in low sec for 150-300m+ per hour with stuff that costs about that much X3 or more to setup. The 'freedom' of this game is a complete illusion in which players are expected to become part of a hiveminded corporation in order to excel at all. If you want to play solo or less than ten people, you will need thousands of hours to do that. The 'learning curve' as explained by people is nothing more than an excuse not to make the game more user friendly. For those of us who have social anxiety or issues around huge groups of people it's a terrible environment. In most MMOs you can access the content of the game in some sense in your own way, but the endgame in Eve requires more friends than you could ever make in your life without joining a copy/paste corporation and assuming the identity they give to you. Don't even think about making your own corporation, because at the end of the day no one will join it if you don't know everything about Eve. For those of us who are leaders and not followers it makes it difficult to enjoy if at all possible. 


I don't see anything at all cool about endorsing scamming in a videogame either. Promoting negative attitudes and ways of being is simply not a good way to foster a 'community'. It's how to get a bunch of jackasses in one place doing the same thing for 'fun' at the expense of all the rest of the players. 



'Freedom' is such an illusion here it's not even funny. You might as well say that Eve is a city of gangsters and you have to choose which gang to join to go anywhere. Wanna go past highsec areas? 90% chance you'll get killed in a basic ship for no reason (Even one that costs 5 seconds to make and obviously has no value) Want to do something other than highsec stuff, the fun stuff that actually progresses the game? 90% chance you'll come across a huge group of people already doing it that will simply turn their guns on you instead, because there's no penalties for doing that in 'nullsec'. Risk/reward shouldn't be interpretted as 'lose all 200 hours of your game time because a group of assholes decided you needed to start over'. The ratio of Risk to reward is incorrect and does NOT help the immersion of being in a living world at all, in fact it takes you out of it. The reality is you can't go anywhere (You can, but you'll just die to campers. You know those guys that camp spawns in Halo or CSGO in deathmatch? It's that, with hundreds of hours of work) Or do anything (You can, but again a gigantic sun-blotting cloud of bullies will come and steal it from you after you set it up for 5 days, they destroy it in 5 minutes) or have fun (You can, but once again 'having fun' will be you riding a bicycle because you wanted to play the game differently from everyone else, while everyone who joins the 'cool kidz' gets a ferrari in five minutes.) Fun? Group. Profit? Group. Adventure? Group. If group is removed from any of those sentences the game is designed, it is fundamentally designed to make your progress slower. It doesn't incentivize  you to work together aside from 'tougher enemies' but in reality it's 'work together because we want to force our players to talk to people they don't care about to succeed' I'm sorry, I can't be friends with 100 other people, the human brain is limited in this way and you can't form a lasting connection to people who's only point and purpose is to be a worker bee because that's the only way to get ahead in the game. You CANNOT and will not be able to access all content at the end of the game with less than 50 people. You ever tried talking to 50 people in one room? Do you think it's necessary to force gameplay to be based around this volume of people? You don't GET countless options, because your first enemy is a wallet. You get access to ships as long as you're subscribed and once it ends they're locked until you do again. If that's not a problem for you and you 'want' to support the game (Supporting it because you need to not because you want to) then fine. First enemy defeated. Second enemy, groups. You wanna be a miner and collect massive amounts of ore? COOL! Throw in your hat to the thousands of other hats doing the EXACT same thing as you, probably better than you because of how the skill system works. You're a grain of sand in a desert, it's not freedom it's illusionary. You don't 'make a difference' on your own unless you know exactly where to go what to do and how to do it. Otherwise you'll be fodder and a number that the CEO of the corp you're in gets money from. There's no freedom in being enslaved to a corporation and having a chain connected to your free will that reads the Corp's name. 




Yes, I know. I don't have 4000 hours of experience and I haven't been 'there' or stuff like that. I get that. I don't want to anymore. I wanted to, I wanted to make a difference and make a change. But the reality is? Most can't. This is because the system of the game itself is your enemy. I want to play with the people I want to, to get where I want to go. I'm sorry, I can't find 100 friends to play this game with that I know personally and care to talk to. I'm here to 'socialize' not talk to a livestream chat room. This is the first lie of 'freedom'. The second is being able to do what you want, when in reality you have to join a corporation and do what 'they' want. If you make your own, you won't have the manpower to do anything. There comes a point when 'massively multiplayer' becomes too massive. Friendships don't come out of this, only co-workers. I come to play a game, not a job.

Piracy back in the day was awesome, you could ransom their ship or pod for isk. solo and small gang pvp was my bread and butter. However the longer the game persists the worse it is for solo and small gang. as the mega corps/guilds, control the game. solo pvp does not exist. if you fly anything cruiser size or larger you end up getting jumped by 40 people. if you leave the game and return looking for a group, they are all the same, and worse yet everyone thinks everyone is a spy. so joining a corp is a chore. last time i play4ed i spent 3 days trying to decide who to join and then  realized, eve is no longer a game to play. its a game about social engineering, you will spend more time chatting than you will actually shooting other players. However this game has given me some of my greatest moments in gaming. leading my own  corp in a small gang roam of 4 pilots in t1 cruisers and frigates, we took out a command ship in a WormHole. Wish i could do it all over again, but sadly those days are gone. Not to mention, flying Battleships was always the coolest thing in my mind, but you cant do it solo because a single frigate will dominate you unless you are built speciffically for it, and even then now you would just get hot dropped by capitals.
   I will say if you manage to find a good group or even get (ALOT) of your friends to play, you can have a great time doing anything from waging war and piracy, or mining and hauling. The More the Merrier is probably the best description for this game.  Solo play can be done, but you will become bored quickly with the tedium of PvE content as its sole purpose in this game is to Fuel PvP and the Devs do Nothing to change or update PvE except make it harder (due to the war on bots it has become even worse athough i am pleased they try really hard to shut down botting) and cater to the Mega Corps that have controlled Eve for a Decade. This game is not for the casual player, Eve is designed so that the guy thats been playing for 10+ years will destroy you and prevent you from doing anything in hisec, flying any fancy ships or a freighter is simply suicide anymore thanks to gankers, because little frigates or destroyers that might cost 2-10 mil will destroy your 2 Bil ship in a matter of seconds before Concord (Space Police) can do a damn thing about it.

6 years after writing my first review the game has taken an even worse turn. Most ores havee been removed from the game and forced PvP has been instituted for PvE people due to the ESS system. There are grossly overpowered ships for the ESS system. For every 100 million isk I have made I have made it has cost me 500 million isk to defend it. This is a obvious cash grab to try to get people to buy their isk from CCP by making it impossible to play without subscribing AND buying currency. The game has gone pay to access and pay to actually play the thing you already pay to access.

1st Review.
After playing this game for over 2 years I reccomend staying away.. I really wanted to like this game. The PvE is crap and only PvP that is decent is priating(whitch is one of the few things I never did). The ONLY way to make money in this game is by screwing other people over by scamming or pirating. I think its silly that the people actually taking risk are the ones who make NO money. The in game risk is NOT worth the reward. The the game gets so buggy at times too.

From the beginning they promised to pay to win mechanics but since they have been bought by the Chinese Government they have been pushing monthly Pay packs that give you ships and EXP so you can ""get to the fight faster"". These are not just boosters available to new players but to everyone so they don't have to go through the long grinds to get there skills to where they need to be. Pay $50 USD and get enough exp point to skip entire ship tier trees, and weapon trees. So if you have enough money you can start an account today and get into the strong ships in the game without even playing the game. Sure its a terrible idea because you will probably just die a lot and have no idea what you are doing which brings me to my next point. CCP have stated many times that they have no intention of stepping in with player conflicts or the games economy as proof of this the games economy has been crashed many times by players in prep of war or just cause they want to be dicks which allowed many neat strategies during war times. A smaller group that didn't much like war could horde minerals and starve the market so the enemy couldn't buy the materials to build new ships to keep fighting with however with the last patch mined minerals are no longer needed to build ships so in turn not only did they kill mining corps but now they prevented player interaction within the market economy.

Or even the challenge of logistical networking to move resources, ships, or ammo through varying degrees of dangerous space!

PVE....Have been playing for some years and have seen that the violence has been growing ,while the ammount of players have gone the other way.. What is so fun with sneaking around gates and asteroid fields and shoot/kill defenceless ships and players... I recently made a new char from scratch...Was just finished with the intro missions. I took my newly bought mining barge in to the asteroid field in my home system to mine some money (ore) ,i had been there for a couple of minutes...Then BOOM!... And they think it is starnge that the game does not have more players...If you are completely new to the game and this happens ,you quit. Plain and simple.
Have seen they are firing up test servers...What is the point of running 3 servers for a handfull of maniac players??
I would very much like to put out a wote ,to see mow many of you out there would welcome a PVE server ,where you had to press the unsafe button to make the game go to PVP... I would welcome such a server with open arms...And i think that the amount of players coming to the game would be increased to.

Well where to begin, back in 09 I made my first account and joined the wondrous Galaxy (Its not a Universe) of Eve Online.

Playing the game for about 4 years onwards I was still learning, still trying to understand the game in its massive complexity and player social aspect. 

I stopped for about a few years and revent in november 2016 decided to play again, made a Corporation (Guild, Clan etc.)  and progressed making my 2nd character in the game as an alt as Eve is very alt orientant for scouting, mining, even missioning for salvaging (Another way to get monthly ££ I guess). 

This time round I did not have such a plesent experience with the game, in fact the game that was ""My game"" was gone ruined by CCP listening to players about things that didnt matter and simple mechanics that were removed that caused a very toxic and unhealthy player base. 

Example: Code a player driven alliance bent on forcing players to pay to not be killed in their ships while mining which in eve is a big thing, mining contributes to everything in eve that can be built, doing that those players have created a ""faction"", a ""Extremism or Fanaticism"" where one player given too much control, too much authority in the game, the list goes on but for the review I used ""Code"" as an example as within your first month you will encounter them and you will be made to bow to their regime of subjugation as myself and a lot of my Corp members who were new to the game and were still trying to understand an explore this wondrous enviroment being subject to radicalisation in the from of hate text and links being posted in chat that described the average industrial player as a ""cancer"" on the community (This is fact http://www.minerbumping.com/p/the-code.html ), please have a read, I sure did and after a ticket to CCP was told to suck it up as they are working within the game mechanics. 

I find it very fustrating that due to the what I call removal of an old school mechanic that some players wont know about if you new to the game, where a player had to insure there ""clone"" so that upon death you did not loose skill points, with the removal of this mechanic death was meaningless, make a clone and jump into your clone and suicide everyone and everything, there is no punishment unless you are a charismatic person who can rally a bunch on players togeather to go get payback (but then arnt you doing that same thing they are for a different reason (this is how war is conducted by the way ccp) again I use the Alliance ""Code"" for this due to there presence in the game being higher than most other griefers. 

Oh and you might not know but with an active player base of 40-45,000 people (not unique people) playing over 5,000 of them will be with said alliance and if not with another because its the easiest thing to do.

Let me explain why its easy to greif. Eve has a system setup where you have different space of different secruity levels these are ""High Sec"" the green zone, Low Sec the unclaimed pvp wonderland and Null sec the home of controled player space where players are the owners of the space (disputed), High sec used to be lower in value for many reasons, ore was more sparse and had lower levels of sale value, taxes were placed on use of stations and so on (Small amount) and with the mechanic of player clone insurance, high sec was a safe place to learn the game conduct operations into null or low sec and use the trade hubs for marketing. 

Well not anymore, flying in High sec has to be one of the most fustrating and nerve wrecking things I have ever done ( Ive been in shark cages off the coast of africa this was worse) you dont know who your enemy is, everyone is visable they could be next to you minig in a astroid and then 2 seconds later your dead, the miner was faking and running a tank dps drone setup or your hauling your precious cargo only to be ""bumped"" off the gate, again another use of incorrectly implemented game mechanics till your out of reach of concord not so far they can warp but far enough they have to use sublight to get to you in time if fired upon, in that time your ship is destroyed and another player warps in from a ""neutral"" corp and collects your items, where are the people that killed you, well there in cheap ships designed for one thing, you death. 

Now dont fear as eve is a very progressive game you learn you adapt and things get easier, but this game is no longer for me, my character who is now over 8 years old will be put to rest, Eve has in its attempt to Drum up player base has created in my own view a very toxic game and i do not want to be associated with a game development community that allows for such views and does nothing to protect its newier playerbase, yes they have studies of limited player pools on ""hey did you die, YES, did you continue playing, Yes"" answers without anymore information, ""Yes i continue playing but i will be quitting soon"" is the real answer, just google eve horror stories of player inprisiment, forced lanbour, theft, oh hope your a good poker player as lieing will get you far in theis social driven game where you friend someone hey onces they give you access to things, just take it, its the way the world works now according to CCP. 

- This is my rant, everything I said in here comes for experience in game, you can find online, read on reddit, I know some people will read this with thoughts of ""oh some dude who got killed and just wants to moan about it"" and your partly right, I dont enjoy this game anymore, I will not be resubbing my 2 accounts I will not continue on my Eve Adventure. 

Thank you for reading this rant/ review.


Update: 
So after year or so, I headed back into Eve Online with some friends, lived almost exclusively in worm hole space (WH space is a section of space cut off from known stargates and requires the use of randomly spawning worm holes to enter and exit), it was fun, rather limited, discovered my dormant solo killer cloaky camper pilot inside me. 

After a year or so in WH space, I moved onto Null sec, which in all purposes was the last frontier for me in Eve online having almost a decade of game time, Steam hours included. 

However even then, I found eve to be more about the people than the game itself, got heavily back into mining, started a Ice mining empire with 12 accounts, and for the first time I was respected and rewarded for my efforts rather than scorned as a BOT, or a ""Cancer"" on the community, haha even after the mining nurfs which almost crippled the economy (Thanks CCP). 

Couple months rolled by, once again, eve lacked the substance to retain me, I moved on to other games, finding excitement and adventures. 

Eve is 100% a game everyone in the MMO sphere should try once, its hard, its brutal, its chaotic, its ridiculously self governed but its not Eve from 2009 or Eve from 2016. 

Happy update, Code disbanded, thank god, I'm sure a number of clones will appear in its place. 

Something I wanted to finish on was, myself and most people in eve, are not attached to their assets ""don't fly what you cant afford to lose"" however my gripe came with the unmoderated mentality of people in the game when given too much freedom as with CODE once was, extortion, betrayal, kidnapping, physiological warfare and manipulation ect all great headlines for a blog or a Youtube video, however the fact is, the players that are trying to learn the game, Day 1 out of the clone vat lobby, in their mining Frigate thankfully provided by the game for missions, are now prey to Bitter vets, gung-ho wannabe pirates and bank robbers but the truth is, that player logs off that evening, tells his/her mates about their experience and mostly never logs back in again. 

A sad state for eve which is mostly comprised of Veteran players and skill injected P2W capital pilots, I mean, CCP included a ship spinner counter in game when you spin your ship in a station.

I will only bring up examples from my own experience when it feels necessary. Also i will be talking from a subscription veiw not f2p. 

Pro: 
Market: The economy is by far what drew me to the game and is exactly what I adore the most. Mining the minerals, creating the ships and modules in a player driven economy. Knowing it all fuels the gears of war without you ever directly taking apart in it. I loved it and it is by far the best thing to me.

Wars: The players drive the wars and can change the economy of the game or even the meta in a heartbeat. Seeing massive battles take place and knowing it is all players in 1,000+ bloodbath is amazing and truly an achievement. Good job CCP for drawing enough players to make such a thing possible.

Grinding: You always have something to do and not in a bad way. You have so many options to create and generate isk that all you have to do is fit a ship and go do it. From various differnt types of PvE options, to PvP corps, Faction warfare, events, the abyssal space, exploration, mining, industry, etc. There are many different ways to do it all and gives you many ways to grind for whatever it is you desire. 

Cons:
Veterans vrs New Players: Yes a mute point for most mmo i personally do not care to much as vets always have the advantage. The problem with Eve itself in this regard is the economy. Permadeath mechanics are amazing to me as it really makes a death actually mean something which filters out people just spamming the highest end gear. Though Eve has a unique problem resulting from this. Deaths to veterans are negligible in some cases and gives them freedom to truly do whatever they want. While new players barely have access to basic tasks and options for fun. This is not in reference to PvP rather PvE. The PvP aspect only really comes into play when you have gankers in High sec areas which i am neutral on only because it is actually not profitable and only for the laugh.

Corporations: Corporations are almost necessary. My own issue with this is just how necessary it is for any miner or an industrialist to be in a corporation, furthermore one that has structures in low sec. Now if you don’t do mining you’ll be fine. Various ways to get in and out safely with your hauls without a need to swap ships (more on that later). The main problem for new players is simply that you have to join an already well established corporation in order to have some modicum of freedom. Otherwise you join a small corp and struggle endlessly to maintain a stake of low sec that has little to no value and pray the larger corps do not decide to force you to join or simply get killed.

Skills: Waiting… more waiting... Don’t want to wait? Spend real money on the game. The skills take time to train which isn;t an issue at the start. A few minutes, hours, days means nothing when you have plenty to accomplish during that time. Then you hit literal months for training time for a single level in a skill. Yeah there is nothing positive I can say about it. This is further rendered problematic by the sheer number of skills in addition to such time lengths. It can take months before you even get the basic skills necessary to pilot some ships. This has only one upside for the insane time length for the skills. That would be preventing people from getting a hand on high end ships early on. This is only rendered pointless as the cost of fitting the ships and the ships themselves in isk is also a time sink. Honestly I can only say it exists as it does for the sake of encouraging buying skill injectors with real money. If you want to specialize it will take months and being a jack of all trades heavily hinders your effectiveness and is actively discouraged. If you join a corp and wish to partake in the wars you have to specialize or follow a fleet doctrine which only is an issue thanks to the time it takes to train skills. If you are an industrialist and have no combat skills you already will have problems but skilling into two different paths is very much discouraged unless you take two characters to train them down different paths which costs additional money beyond the subscription to do so. This “forced” specialization I feel is very unhealthy as if a new player enters the game not knowing what they really want to do it just hinders them heavily.

Time and “freedom”: A combination of the previous issues is the time it takes to be able to do many things. If you wish to be low sec industrial you have to be in a corp. To be able to mine effectively you have to join a large corp which brings a lot of other tasks that you may not want to do. Then you have smaller corps fighting for the scraps. You have to treat the game like a second job practically in both cases to maintain your position in the corps or the stake.
You can do whatever you want. That is true. Yet to do a lot of the things the game promotes itself for and is often what people want to do. You can not casually play the game. It takes way too much time and you have to adhere to restrictions and various other requirements to have the chance to get to do them. If you are willing to put in the lengthy amount of time you will be fine.

Isk Generation: Without going into a rant i will stay short. Alts accounts plague the game and while CCP does limit it the best they can. They do not stop it completely. They are not gods and I can not fault them entirely for this. Though the game’s set up makes it difficult to fix... You as an individual running one account will forever struggle for a minimum of months (if you don’t die a lot). The best way to gain Isk requires you to have very expensive ships and even then a massive amount of skill which lays into the “time” problem. These methods of generating Isk without an alt are not exploits are more of min maxing yet is problematic for anyone but a vet. These methods of isk farming often also favor people who specialize in PvE combat not pvp and heavily outsrips mining by a large margin. Of course this is just an optional method and Risk Versus Reward is difficult to balance in this type of game. Rat farming is far riskier than mining rocks after all. Which is why my only two complaints will be the mere fact the isk generation of the game favors those who are vets and leaving little options for new bros. The second being that the alt accounts plague the economy and makes it difficult to really provide better methods for new players to get isk effectively. 

Final Assessment: Very good game that I would love to encourage people to play. Though the sheer amount of tilting against new players is daunting. I do not see a way to fix it other than speeding up skill training since Isk itself still takes a long time to generate and is lost easily due to perma death which would lessen the gap and make the many, many options within the game easier to access and enjoy. In the end if you are willing to put hundreds of hours into the game then yes. I would recomend playing otherwise you are not going to enjoy yourself.",1597335125,1597335125,False,4,0,0.546963810920715332,0,True,False,False

The community however, is exceptionally welcoming as the difficulty in entry is well known, and there are, again as in life, very many avenues you can take to uplift yourself, where many veterans actively pursue holding on to new players and educating them about the depths of the game.

With regular content and core-code updates that keep this 17-year old game in modernity, the player driven economy and player operated political story is kept alive as the Capsuleers of New Eden vie for control in over 1000 systems, where almost every item you interact with is built by players. There is something for everyone, from industry, pvp, pve, and even market analysis, political commentary, and systems of education.

On day one you could run into a player who would be willing to help you through a mission, offer to take you to Low-Sec/Null-Sec - spend all the time possible with you; and then they turn around, blast your ship apart and kill you in your pod just because they get off on the thrill of it.

That's really the beauty of this game - it's a true sandbox, with fully player-emergent gameplay. Hardly anything is run by the developers or the game itself besides the anomalies you might run into. When you leave High-Sec space, almost everything you run into on your travels will be a player looking to make their own way in this massive universe.

PvE elements include hunting for relic and data sites in scanned anomalies, exploring wormholes, and getting into scuffles with various NPC pirate factions, but even here you're still at risk of running into other players who will kill you if you pick up something valuable.

Money and the economy is, by itself, a form of PvP in this game - the market is entirely player-driven, with no artificial inflations or recessions generated by the game itself.

When you get into a big fleet with a relatively large corporation that's part of a big alliance, though, everything just clicks together. You suddenly become a part of something much greater, even if it's something simple as camping gateways on most-traveled routes. Literally everyone has a place in the PvP aspect of this game - even the Newbro Alpha player that can only fly basic Frigates fitted with basic fittings.

Good game, lots of freedom, quite a bit grindy as it always has been.
Never fly something you don´t want to/can´t afford to loose.
Playerbase needs a bit of a boost but most likely won´t get back up to it´s highest playercount which dropped when they introduced Skill Injectors.
Is this game p2w? No.
Can you do everything without paying? Yes, but it´ll be alot of grind since the game is subscription based, gametime can be achievemt through ingame money aswell tho.
Is this game as complicated as everyone says? No. It really isn´t, you just need to get used to the game alot more than to other games.
Also: Skills in this game are trained and therefore it´s a passive gain. Find out what you want to specialize on and plan your skillqueue accordingly.
Despite what most people say: The game can be played solo, but it won´t hurt to join a corp since it opens up more possibilities, especially early on.
Is EVE fair by its pure gameplay? It definietly isn´t, so don´t expect every person to fight/be fair either.

Is it worth starting EVE  due to the difference in Skills between newer and older players? Yes. But don´t buy subscription time straight away, play it for a bit and decide afterwards. When focusing on a specific role/playstyle, it won´t take too long to get as far as others already are. For more variety in skills: That´d take longer - also most people haven´t obtained ""all skills"" yet and probably won´t obtain them within the next years.",1593015759,1593015759,True,6,3,0.514607906341552734,0,True,False,False

Yes, I have been playing this game since 2010.  In reality I was probably docked in station for the first five of those years (and have a few alt characters).

But I wanted to address some of the normal criticisms and complaints about the game.

Yes, it is complicated.  
Yes, you have to be patient.  
Yes, the game does not hand hold you throughout the game (other than through the tutorials which I highly recommend completing) or points you in a specific direction.
And Yes, many actions which other games are considered cheating are allowed by the Software Publisher.

Why?  Because it is up to the player to discover the universe and make a choice.  Yes, you may be ""ganked"" or lose that ""blinged"" out ship you just bought off of the market.  But with every loss you ""should"" gain knowledge of what not to do again.  Folks complain about constantly being podded or attacked while ""mining"" or whatever activity, what those folks don't acknowledge is probably they weren't paying attention (afk mining) or they were in the wrong Security space (LOW/NULL/Worm Hole).

Here is the dichotomy of the Game.  The EVE Community of players is one of the most hard core groups of people you will ever meet; in game they may back stab you; attempt to scam you; lie or attempt to cheat you; or use questionable tactics, etc.  

But if you ever meet them in real life they will give you the shirt off of their back and help anyone in real life as shown by the CCP sponsored PLEX for good where the players raise money for whatever good cause.

And how passionate are the players?  I only point to all of the player created and maintained content and tools that have been published for the greater good of the EVE Community.  In the beginning, there wasn't much information in game or out of the game.  So what did the EVE Community do?  They made their own tools and websites.

As I said in the previous review, EVE isn't for everyone and that is fine.  But if you have patience, be willing to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes, you can become whatever you want to be.  And, if you don't like what you chose? you can change and go down another path.

One final item I would like to address is whether the game is ""Pay to Win""  Yes, you could buy a ""blingy"" ship and outfit it with ""blingy"" weapons or buy ""skill points"" to gain a new skill.  But if you do not know the mechanics of the game or have actual knowledge about the game, you will lose your ""blingy"" ship or relieved of your assets very quickly.

I will leave you with my top 5 advice tips I have been given since I started playing.

1: ""Don't fly anything you cannot afford to lose"".  And oh by the way, you will lose your ships.  Fact of life.  Faster you accept loss the sooner you will enjoy game.

2: ""By selecting ""Undock"" you consent to PVP"".  The only safe place with zero risk of losing a ship is docked in a NPC station.

3: Complete all of the tutorial missions and complete them again (yes you can rerun those missions multiple times along with running the tutorial missions of different races)

4: Find and join a player ran corporation (space can be very boring alone)

5: Finally, I would encourage anyone to try EVE once.  But realize it's up to you to find your place in NEW EDEN.  It may take time.  You might make a few mistakes.  You might lose your ship or even podded.  But if you can find your way and maybe find a good corporation.  The rewards are worth it.  I am still trying to figure out what to do or fly.

Keeping this short

1) EVE is not your usual MMO Space Sim that you will expect.
2) You can be whatever you want, pirate, bounty hunter, miner, logistics, wholesale supplier, gate camper,Human resource, Role play, whatever you fantasize. 
3) It has politics in every corp or alliance, Just like your everyday real life job where there are  backstabbing and people who like to stir s**t up.
4) You will master Microsoft Excel for free as you are basically looking at spread sheets everyday.
5) And lastly, EVE is not a game, it's a player economy driven full time career. You work from day to night.

Alright. I think I've played quite a bit to warrant a review on this game. [i] TL:DR at the bottom. [/i]

I started playing this game back in 2010. My friend and I saw this cool Space MMO and thought ""That sounds like the game we've been looking for."" At the time there was no FTP so we were all in. Subbed our savings and dove head first. At first we were just marveling at the size and beauty of the game. Eventually we started running missions, getting our dream ships, and even dipped our toes in Null Sec for a little mining. We got killed right away but we loved it! Addiction set in. We got our money's worth out of that 30 day sub. Fast forward to now. I've made more friends and play with them pretty much on the daily. We run mining-ops, drop into abyssal deadspace, run incursion sites, pretty much everything the game has to offer. I'm still addicted.

[b] Starting Out [/b]
The beginning of this game can go in many directions. A majority of them ending up in you dying. But that's fine. Getting that done in the very beginning sets you up for the rest of the game. It's about acceptance. Don't worry about flying around as an Alpha Clone for a while. It's a good way to save money, both real and virtual. Yes you may lose that ship you worked so hard for, but gaining the capital to get it back isn't a problem. It's up to you to decide how to get it. Missions, mining, exploring. Don't be afraid to dip your toes into anything that pops out at you. All that matters is you pick yourself back up, learn from your mistakes, and take a new approach. No encounter in this game is ever the same. The game offers a treasure trove of activities.

[b] Gameplay [/b]
There are TONS of things to do in this game. If PVE is your style, stick to missions and Combat Anomalies. Do you like gathering resources, crafting ships/parts/ammo, making a profit? You can definitely do that. Do you just want to hop into a death machine and gun down any player you see? Get gunned down yourself? Go right ahead! The list is endless. AND you don't have to do them alone! Local chat has tons of people that wouldn't mind helping out a newbro. Yes you'll get an occasional troll, but every MMO has those. If you like team based activities, join a Corporation. There are so many good corps out there willing to help you out in whatever it is you want to do. Deep space mining-ops, Wormhole PVP, Nullsec shenanigans. There is a corp for everything. There is even an option in the game called The Agency which streamlines all the activities you can do in an easy-to-use interface. Just pick whatever sounds interesting to you, set a course, and get to it!

[b] Long-Term Playability [/b]
In EVE, you'll come for the Space MMO gameplay, but you'll stay for the content and community. You'll honestly build friendships in this hostile space environment. People will have your back. Gameplay will get easier(and more fun!). You'll lose less ships and make more money. Hell, you'll get so good you could use in-game money to pay for your subscription. CCP adds events here and there to keep the universe fresh. And if you need a break, don't worry about switching between Omega(Paid) and Alpha(Free) clones. You'll keep everything you earned as an Omega, you just can't use it. But by then you'll know how to fit an Alpha ship that can keep up with an Omega build. If you're ready to come back, just resub and you're back to where you left off. Work 9-5? Me too! Even an hour in the game can get you some good action.

[b] Verdict [/b]
I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Open World, RPG, and Space. Just try it out. It's FTP, and you take it on your own time. There's no need to rush into anything the game offers. If you want to stick it out in Hi-Sec and make mission money all day. Do it! If all you want to do is blap other players in PVP, find a PVP corp and they'll set you up! [i] #SmallGang all day. [/i] There will never be a time where you will ALWAYS win at this game, and that's not a bad thing. That's what keeps it fun. It's ruthless, merciless, and outright cruel, but it doesn't stay like that forever. Believe me, I've lost tons of ships, tons of trade goods, and tons of mined ore to NPCs and Players alike. What I realized is that a majority of those losses were on me. I learned what I did wrong found a way around it, and continued to have fun. You will have your triumphs.

If you're a new player and need some friendly aide, a wingman to fly with, or hell even someone to talk to amidst the vastness of space, feel free to PM or add me. I'll shoot you my pilot name. Have fun & Fly Safe. I'll see you out there o7


[h1] TL:DR [/h1]

A deep MMO with a crazy good community and in-depth gameplay activities to keep you going for a long time. Bit of a learning curve, but it all depends on what you want to partake in. If you take the game in small strides, mastering the basics, it becomes a fun and engaging experience that you can share with friends you've made along the way.

Combat is about managing the capacitor, nothing else. Every single PVP battle is the SAME: web, scrambler, capacitor drain. I hate this aspect. There's no diversity in battle at all. And because EVERYTHING and everyone around you is webbed, movement is ungodly slow, which translates into slow gameplay. It's just not exciting. What's worse, you lose everything you worked for in one fight: ship, cargo, implants, everything is gone forever. And you can't just buy a new fit and set sail again. The parts have to be available by real players in your area or you might have to travel several jumps and hope you don't get killed and wake up back in your cloned body where you first started. 

I personally think the game would be a LOT better if they got rid of the capacitor draining, or at least prevented it from happening once the capacitor reduces to a certain percentage. The ENTIRE combat system becomes about who has better capabilities to drain the other's capacitor. There are other things to consider, like size of vessels, transverse speed, armor, but the combat mechanism is only about one thing. I feel like I'm beating a dead horse. 

Secondly, there is no PVE element, or very little at that. No epic missions on which to embark, no satisfying rewards for completing tasks. There's only fighting real players that gang up on you while gate camping and having all your $h!t stolen, or beating them and taking theirs. Not everyone likes that kind of gameplay. Yes, there is other things like mining (literally pointing a laser at a rock for hours and nothing else), but nothing really that exciting. Again, this game just falls short of any excitement outside of PVP. Sometimes I just want to get from point A to point B without having to deal with people. 

I think a fun idea would be the ability to hire NPCs as a patrol guard while you want to travel in low/nullsec, or while you do a security mission.

Anyway, there's just not enough diversity in this game to justify a paid subscription. Meh, I've had better.",1590625385,1590625855,False,4,0,0.528447747230529785,0,True,False,False

The not so good: The tutorial system in game does almost nothing to teach you how to play. Learning anything useful requires a lot of trial and error, learning from other players, and internet research. 

The bad: First, don't get this on Steam. I started an alt account on Steam and it is a pain. Often steam doesn't realize the game is closed so when I come back to it, my Steam alt won't start because Steam thinks the client is running (this is without having started the client with my main).

The really bad: This is a PvP game. Everything you do, from market trading to combat, is somehow related to PvP. Even NPC missions, since you can always be shot by players and the loot you get is traded on the player driven market. The real selling point for this game is that you get to do ship combat. The problem is that finding content is essentially just playing a complex game of rock-paper-scissors. Most of the time, players you meet are multi-boxing because they can't reliably get people to play with them, so you need to multibox to stay competitive. 

""looking for content"" is a common term in the game that essentially means trying to find someone to fight. Most of the time, if anyone is willing to fight you, it is on their terms, so they will win! So ""looking for content"" is playing a cat and mouse game among the stars trying to find someone to fight with. When you do find some content, the fight is rarely satisfying because you engaging on your terms, meaning you were destined to win as soon as you target locked them and warp scrambled them. When you get into a big corp with a big fleet, you can spend hours just following the fleet around ""looking for content"". Most of the time you are better off on your own, hunting an explorer or miner or hauler who can't possibly fight back because it's the surest way to ""get content"". Eventually someone does the same to you, and you fight a battle that was decided the minute you got warp scrambled, and the only chance for excitement is successfully evading their tackle and fleeing the scene, otherwise, you are dead, and you need to go make money to buy a new ship.

So players actually spend most of their time just trying to make money to buy the coolest ships and fits. Nothing wrong with it, in fact the ironic thing is that making money is the only really exciting part about the game because you are trying to do it smart so you don't end up ""being content"" for someone else. 

But when you realize that you are just perpetuating this endless cycle of making money so that you can spend hours ""looking for content"" you realize that there are thousands of other PvP games that can deliver ""content"" fairly regularly, with more excitement, where skill in the fight is actually the deciding factor instead of being in the wrong place at the wrong time... or vice versa. 

My hours played of course is only for my steam alt... my 4th alt. Having 4 alts is actually pretty mild compared to most longtime players. I always tried to resist having alts to play the game and multibox, but it really became necessary if  I was going to seek a PvP fight, rather than the entirely unexciting series of ganks. Miners and haulers and explorers are easy ""content"" to find, but they are equally easy to kill. So I graduated to several alts so I could hunt and tackle and kill mission runners and ratters in more advanced ships. This gave me a renewed joy in the game as I learned how to do it without losing any of ships. It quickly became easy and boring, and felt no different than killing a Alpha in a Heron trying to do their first data site. Fleet combat is both more exciting and more boring. It always seems to require so much time to get going and to find content, and when you do you have the extra excitement of working with a group to accomplish an objective... but when the thin veneer of teamwork and goal satisfaction is wiped away, you realize you are just scaling up a gank, and investing more time doing it, and being told by someone else 'how' to do it. You might as well be taking a max level MMORPG character into a raid group to complete a 'normal' instance for all the challenge you get. The rewards are actually worse in the end than single player killing... er... ganking, and you spent more time doing it.",1587418983,1588647879,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
1) I've spent almost three real-time years playing this game, 'cause I love it.  It's got so much freedom, so much independance, and so much strategy and thinking to it that it will grab you and not let go.

2) There is an entire universe to explore!  You can spend literal hours just traversing the systems going from point A to point B.  Think ""Lord of the Rings travelling to Mordor"" in space.

3) The graphics are amazing, and the art is stunning.  I will just look at the screen sometimes, taking in the amazing background imagery of the galaxy.  I've even got a couple that I use as backgrounds 'cause they are so awesome.
Cons: 

1) F2P but P2W model.  If you just want to dink around, the F2P model (Alpha Pilot) will allow you to do a LOT of things for years and years of fun.  If you want to be top-dog, however, you're going to have to pony up the fees to become Omega.

2) Highly resource intensive.  It's  B-EA-UTIFUL game on high shader settings, but you can hear the fans complaining when I do that.  I often run the game on ""Performance"" or ""Memory"" balance for fear of prematurely burning out my rig.

3) Beware the trade-hubs.  So you get good at things, and think to yourself ""Wow, I could sell this lot in a trade hub and make a lot of money!""  This isn't always the case as the road to market will often be laden with gankers and other unsavory types that only want to make your life miserable.

4) Oh, and beware thinking that this is an ""idle time"" game.  Don't use the Autopilt feature (you'll get blowed up), and don't think ""well, I'm camped here in space so I'll go pee right quick"" because way too many bad things can happen.  There are even alliances of corporations who think that they can make the rules of the game and will chastise you for ""not playing it their way"".  For those pilots, there is a feature called ""block"" that you can use liberally.

Okay, I'll try...

Eve and I have a love/hate relationship. I love the graphics beauty. I hate getting blown up. I love the community. I hate getting blown up. I love the complexity! Oh, and did I mention, I hate getting blown up! XD

Community is everything in Eve. Every friend (and every enemy) you make will change the game for you. And they are all players, too! Almost everything {not skillbooks) you buy was made (or found) by a player. And every player wants to make a buck (ISK) off the less enlightened. So, be very aware!

When you get wasted in Eve, you really feel it. Everything you've paid for in that ship is lost. Sometimes, that amounts to days (even weeks!)  of effort to acquire. Not to mention the days of skill training to access.

You need to be ready for the long term, if you're going to play this game. The best parts aren't available until you've played for weeks, or even months.

It is a awesome game, and very well made. The overwelming content it amazing, and, if things had turned out different for me, I would still be playing it. From the moment I played it, to the moment I finally stopped, I have lost 27 ships, was beset upon by numerous gangs and ""pirate"" groups who wanted nothing more then to blow my ship up and leave my frozen carcass to float in the infinity of space, and I got stuck in several wormholes. FUN! One guy blew me up when I was trying to recover from getting killed once already, simply because he thought I had valuable resources onboard. Another guy put a bounty on me for cleaning up after him. Which, surprisingly, is a well-paying job, as long as you don't mind having a target painted on you for 30 minutes.

The reason why I'm disliking this isn't the game itself, far from it. The main reason is the people. I could have gladly jumped into the void if it meant being able to play with my equal. but they had other plans.

Solo might as well not be an option as the risks are high, and the chances are also high that you will get preyed upon for running solo.


If you want to play this game and succeed and have fun, it will require the following:
* Voice comms. (Discord, Teamspeak, etc.)
* Joining a corporation and getting a job.
* Being expected to participate in some form of quota, shift, schedule for the job/corporation. 
* Expected to join online at a moment's notice for sudden war/battles if and when they break out. (Some corps have a required response time. They don't care if you lose your real job or have real life consequences).
* Thick-skin. You're gonna die and lose all your stuff a lot.
* Willing to always play with a group, and avoid everyone else. 
* Spending an incredible amount of time gaining skills (which are a true time grind, as in there are no ways to speed it up other than waiting down the clock).


I loved this game way, way back in the late 2000s, early 2010s when I played direct and not through steam. Now that I am older, have a career I enjoy and am respected in, and have family duties - this game is impossible to enjoy. 


All in all the game is fun, but too high of a bar to sustain that fun. 


Die-hard, hardcore players only (who have a LOT of time to kill). For most other people, I think it's a hard pass.


Can't generally recommend. 7/10. 


Thanks for the memories though!

[Update 2/11/2020]

Whoa! Didn't expect this to get a response from the developer!

I stand by my review. Admittedly, it's a been a while since I've jumped into the game again. So I went ahead and reinstalled only to find several ships and skills I already have are behind a subscription paywall. I get it, but I'm not resubbing. 

New UI looks great, and it's interesting to see how much my old items have grown in value (or shrank in some cases). But for me - that's all folks.

Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.

It seems to stay alive through a core-community of veteran players willing to continue to spend money on it. At this point in gaming history, pay-to-play subscriptions are an obsolete business model, and a really poor value overall.

The game desperately needs a complete revamp from under-the-hood items like the graphics engine, audio, and gameplay mechanics to things like community interaction. However, it looks like these things are not on the practical horizon for whatever is left of the game's development team. I get the impression that CCP (the developer) is just pulling out what revenue they can while the game coasts to obsolescence; making minor changes around the edges to try to keep the older paying players around just a little bit longer. In the years that I have been playing, they have also had trouble with just basic stability of their servers and systems. For this type of continuous-play game, that is not really an acceptable condition.

It is unfortunate because there is a lot to like here for an MMO space game. While there are a number of them out there, they mostly seem half-baked. No developer seems to have pulled together an immersive, comprehensive space MMO that is *modern* in terms of hardware/software/game play capabilities. Star Citizen has tried to do that, but has just ended up as a disjointed collection of minigames.

Overall, don't waste your money here. The game needs to bleed to death so that the next developer out there can capitalize on the opportunity to make a great game of this type.

 If you don't like business or economic development, I don't recommend it to you.  No MMO has ever had such a complex economics system.  I played EVE Online back in 2004 when I was still in High School.  I stopped for years because other things came up as EVE requires a dedication on a huge level.  Now that I've got some free time, and stream I've picked it up again.  The visuals were improved on a massive level and with free expansions and updates it makes it a unique game.  A lot of folks would say it's pay to win but, not really.  Even if you pay for Skill Injectors and Plex to get ISK, the allure of using ISK to get PLEX leading to 30 day Omega Clone(paid subscription) makes it very interesting.  Get your business running, others to join your corp and do the same thing, pay ""employees"" in ISK, you can play the game without ever having to pay for a subscription.  It requires a time in-game unlike WoW has ever seen even with the honor system in WoW you will spend more time in EVE Online.  I own and run my own business and this is highly accurate to running a business, from minerals, to production, to selling.  Owning shares in a corp you join gives you a piece of the income pie through owning shares you can also sell or trade with other members.  The contracted trade system only expands the economy to unique one off items that give you an income the normal market won't give you.",1579519826,1579519826,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

34 hours into EVE and I swear to Christ I am still doing tutorial missions, trying to figure out all the different angles to make money and do stuff in this damn game. To fan the flames I have people wanting to do stuff with me, and I'm like ""I AM STILL DOING TUTORIAL MISSIONS""...""LET ME LEARN"".

42 hours into EVE and I have no idea what I'm doing but I still keep playing. I told my friends to fuck off for now.

109 hours into EVE. Holy shit I just realized how many fuckin parts you can have for your ships. There has to be some sort of build guides for these things. This is way too overwhelming.

165 hours into EVE and I still feel like a new guy and I've never been the new guy for so long. I wonder why they call this a game when clearly it belongs in Office 365 Enterprise. Then I realize this wouldn't be EVE without being so ... detailed... I still have no idea what I'm doing, but I keep playing.

207 hours into EVE and I realize I have to get into the 4 day trainings in order to get my hands on a mining barge which are really the only way to go for serious mining...still playing.

219 hours into EVE and I start telling one of my friends about how this is so up my alley. He responds with ""Oh god, here we go, don't push your excel sheet on me"". I respond immediately with, ""First let me say I dont ever recommend you play it so fuck off cause you arent good enough for it"". First sign of addiction is getting defensive...

223 hours into EVE and I'm so happy that my brother came out of retirement to play.  He is old school. I immediately see the advantage to working with other people, most specifically with someone who has 3 accounts and can haul your ore back and reprocess it at 73%...I kind of want to keep playing.

274 hours into EVE I stopped fucking around and finally managed to focus on mining. I got my first barge outfitted with strip miner IIs and my haul has increased over 10x. I love this game and I want to keep playing.

319 hours into EVE and I realize that I am only 1 day and 19 hours in skill training away from a Gallente Battleship. I get excited and read up on which one I should get in preparation into some PVP action. I realize I want an Amarr Battleship instead. Goddamnit. 3 days of training added. Somehow I still find myself wondering when I will actually start ruling this universe.

356 hours in and I finally purchased a GTX 970. I get pumped and go into EVE's settings and ramp everything up to the highest settings. I don't see any difference...

367 hours and I just learned a lesson in the vicinity of 185 million isk. I am not invincible. Just because I can finally fly a Battlship doesn't mean I should start flying a Battleship.

580 hours and I'm STILL training up Astrogeology (12d) AND Mining Barges to lvl V (18d). I'm starting to wonder if these big barges are worth the 30 days of training time.

616 hours and I just finished training Mining Barges to V. I don't even want to mine anymore.

758 hours and I signed up for EVE Echoes Beta. Maybe I can rule that universe.

829 hours in after learning CCP will be deleting my Tech Level VII EVE Echoes data. They rule that universe. For now.

847 hours in and I expect no change in visuals after building my new rig with a 2080. After booting the game I squint, swearing it is better.

951 hours in and I quick close a popup that gets in my face before warping. I immediately lose my hauler. Fuck the Trigs. Digital advertising owes me.

1001 hours in and I head to /r/eve to learn how I can become more involved. Saddened by the hate...but I'm still playing.",1422563534,1579010351,True,556,1064,0.957364499568939209,34,True,False,False

CCP (the creators of EVE online) are bloody-brilliant wizards at creating and constantly innovating this immense and immersive sandbox world.


It is now 2020 and I am still playing this game, since starting my main character in 2012 I have been on countless adventures, made friends and enemies throughout New Eden and had one Hell of a time! If these 8 years have taught me anything, it's that I can never go back to any other MMO out there bc they simply cannot compare to this game. CCP keeps amazing us all:bringing lots and lots of fresh content,and addressing player grievances.

Seriously, If you haven't already... Give this game a whirl. But beware - This is not a game for the feint-hearted, nor those who expect games to have next to no learning curve.

 (I've long since quit playing thru the Steam Client though because the EVE Online Stand-alone client is exceptional, and playing it thru Steam doesn't really add anything for this game)

I can tell you what you can expect though:

-Massive scale/Small scale PVP with multiple roles and multiple ways of engaging in it.
You can roam solo, you can roam with a small fleet of friends, or with your alliance.
You can command small frigates and super capital ships. Each with its role and nuances. Big ships aren't better than small ships, simply different play styles. Different types of DPS, different types of Healer/Supports, etc, etc its fucking UNENDING.

-Player driven Market
It all starts with you mining a rock, then a couple of friends. Next you're manufacturing a ship module, say a blaster. In the end you will be creating entire stations. You will haul goods from one point of the galaxy to the other and you will be gambling with the market prices too with insurmountable amounts of money and items.

-Disputes over sovereignety
This is where those big battles you hear about come in. Large coalitions of conflicting factions plunging hundreds of people into war over control.

This game has the potential to take your wife, your kids, and your job away. Or, you can mine, explore, manufacture, tend to player structures, to your planet goods, pvp or pve, instill political intrigue, spy, steal assets, among countless other activities at your own leisure in this space driven second life.

I played EVE on and off since 2007, being in it for so long I am also most likely a minority that never flew Supers, Titans and experienced the loss of a ship that costs that much but oh boy did I loose some shit that didnt need to happen. The feeling is intense when you work your ass off for something, fit it, research it, build off Blueprints and farm these materials to fleet up with your friends and have a great time. Such a great time that you need to be focused always and have your mates backs because in EVE there is no respawn on a graveyard. You loose, its gone. Start over. Back in the day you even had clone points. If you didnt upgrade your clone and died, you lost weeks, months or years of progress that you skilled. 

You learn new things every single day, even after playing it for 10 years. I never did Wormhole Space living for example, just Null Sec, High Sec. I explored them of course but now I live in one and need to adjust to it. How much do you really learn in a normal MMO that you play for 10 years plus? You most likely know it all already but not here.

The fact that so many say it is pay to win is pure garbage. I could take to stick to a figure load my steam account or play it off steam which I did for the first 12 years and pay 5000€ and then fly Capitals maxed out with injectors on a 1 day old character but what does it help me? I match up with a character who does that since 2 years or more. Is that pay to win? Its pay to save time, nothing more. 

Alphas on the other side, they are restricted to 5 Million SP and can only fly certain ships. Then they have to pay the Plex/Subsribe for 12-13 Bucks a month WHICH CAN! be made in game for free even by doing something called Conduits so easily that no Alpha has to wine for some cheese because all he does is mine in a Venture for 1 Million an hour in High Sec while he could do 75 Million an hour if he does it right.

- You go through the effort of making a cool, complex character, but never get to walk around the world *as* that character. You only exist as a ship. People can see your face but that's it. What's even the point?
- Combat and flying are both astoundingly boring. You click a button and tell your ship to ""fly there,"" or you click a button and tell it to ""shoot at that."" You never feel like YOU'RE the one controlling the ship. You just sit back and watch it do the work for you. 

Again, I only scratched the surface of this game, so take my review with a grain of salt...

The economy is massive and 99% player run; the community is amazing, and the freedom you're given as a player is unparalleled by any other MMO I've ever come across. 

Unlike in other MMOs there aren't many NPC vendors, and those that do exist are more along the lines of an exclusive ""end-game"" store that only sells faction items for faction currency. Every item in the game other than those faction items (and skillbooks) began its life as a virtual asteroid being mined by a player, before being refined into mats and manufactured by a player. Literally everything from the lowliest shuttlecraft to massive capital scale death machines are all made by players. I think its the most realistic simulated market online, or at the very least the most realistic one with a fun game attached to it. 

And it is fun, once you get over the learning curve (which, ill admit, is substantial), and imo its the community aspect that really makes it so enjoyable. The social structure is organized into the game's corporation system (think clans with a strong profit motive); the vast majority of corps are player owned and operated, and many operate as close as possible to how IRL businesses do (thus, job simulator 23020). This sounds like it could be really lame, but its actually surprising how fun it  can be when you're with people you like to chat with and who have the same end-goals that you do (profit!). 

Finally, there's only like 5 rules. One of them is don't impersonate game staff, and another is dont real-world-item trade outside of the regulated channels. Cheating through mods/exploits is also banned but rather than serving as a catch-all banhammer for ""hax"", in EVE known exploits are rigorously defined/enumerated when they are recognized and banned. Off the top of my head i can't think of any other rules.. you can scam, steal, extort, infiltrate, threaten, blackmail.. no holds barred in that respect. You are free to be whoever you want to.

Do I have reached the endgame? Absolutely not. If anything, there is no endgame! I have done just about everything Eve-Online has to offer on what I want to do! This game is going strong and having more content added over time.

Is it a hard game? Yes, it can be. Is it complex? Again, it can be. It all depends on what you plan on doing in the game. 

You can be a Industrialist by building ships or gathering resources from planets, or mine at asteroid fields or gas. 
You can be a combat pilot for PvP under piracy, PvE, or Null Sec. 
You can even be a trader, where you can manipulate the market to your own gains and goals. 
Or you can be an explorer and reach every single space without losing a ship (only one did so far!)
It is up to you on what would get this game to be fun to play or on your play style.

The game is always changing, both its graphics and its mechanics.  This game is not for everyone due of its vast and harsh nature. Just remember, NOTHING is safe in Eve-Online. As Q said to Captain Picard, in a cut quote:

""--- .... It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.""

There was two reasons I play Eve-Online, but due of the recent changes to Skill Points system (skill injectors, etc), it is now one.

1. Everyone (except China ...) play in one server. None of the multiple servers crap. 

What I done so far in Eve are:

I have lived in empire in my first few months into Eve-Online, mostly PvE. 
After that, I spent the next 6'ish years in Null Sec. 
After Null Sec, I spent almost 2 years in Low Sec.
Now I am currently living in wormhole space, another kind of PvP enviroment :) . I am a PvP'er, but I also do industry related things and PvE.

If you want to play the game, my biggest tip is, join Eve-University Corp. Or ask friends that play the game. I seen new pilots go straight to wormholes or null sec, skipping the high sec environment. Only limit there is in the game, is YOU and how you make it succeed!

TL;DR/Short review:

Do I recommend playing?
-Yes, now that it's F2P, you can test it out with an unlimited trial-esque version, risk free to your wallet.

What should I do beforehand?
-Visit the forums and youtube for important third-party sites and guides to adjusting the UI and learning basic rules of flight, like the infamous ""don't fly what you can't afford to lose"".
-If you have friends that have spare time and are interested, bring them along too.

What should I lookout for?
-If you are starting out fresh, not much, just don't try biting off more then you can chew.

[h1]Main review:[/h1]

 I will start off saying that I really wanted to play EVE Online since the long gone days of when the trailer with Junkie XL Beauty Never Fades for the game came out. It was the tits, the bomb and best trailer CCP has made, even my father (who didn't like to play a lot of video games) wanted to play EVE back then, but the near 50$ sub at that time said otherwise.

 Unfortunately only 10-12 years later I got a taste of it, when EVE Online came to Steam and I got a 1 month or 2 sub on a discount to finally satisfy my old desire.

 I liked it, I really did. It was rather relaxing.

 When people talk about it being a second job they are partially correct, it all depends on your personal free time, whether you can afford to play for up to 2-6 hours a day to grid till the next PLEX, or be doomed to cash out each month. And back then I did have thoughts that EVE may become F2P. But I didn't think it would take that quick for EVE to become F2P. Like, it happened 2-3 years later, I was thinking somewhere in 4 or 5.

 So, here we are, with a F2P version and what is there to say?

Dunno actually. To me, I am free to do whatever I want without the grim timelimit of the subcription plan, that is what killed it for me and even now with a limited Alpha it's a better breath of fresh air then anything else. I hate timelimits in games and when it includes real life money, even more so. With the freedom of endless time I can test out things I wouldn't be able to if I were under a subscription pressure. I went into mining because it has/had a better chance at PLEXing and less risk.

Now, I am free, I can plan out a simple long term in-game earning system and come back to it when I have free time.
Yes, even with the current limited Alpha, you can earn a decent amount of ISK. And you don't have to buy 500(new)PLEX for a subscription, you can stockpile ISK as much as you want.

What this means is: even if you lose everything in the game, your ships, money, assets, characters, [strike]dignity[/strike], you essentially didn't lose anything, the game is F2P, you paided zero cents, yet you might have altered something in the game or, you know, had fun. And mind you, in a true MMO sandbox open world game, not many games have that, while being free.

Technically speaking, you don't have to worry playing the game, aside from this one thing: expectations.

You see, with all that EVE offers, it's vastness, it's true butterfly effect and close to real life economics, the battles and everything, as a new player this is not what will dissapoint you, nor the learning cerve or the PVPers and pirates, not even the Omega and PLEXing, or the limited things for new pilots in every aspect. No.

What you will be dissapointed is that your expectations don't match with what the game offers.
The talk about F2P being a rather good thing is that it compensates for the things EVE should/doesn't have.

[h1]The Sort of Cons[/h1]

Ever saw the cinematic trailers? Know how they showcase the battles with frigates dogfighting past battleships and dreads with a titan flying in and sending another ship into oblivion with a doomsday?

Well none of that happens in-game, you will get similar battles like the infamouse bloodbath of WWBee. Only on different scales. But in general that is what you get. Ships orbiting around a target ship at x,y distance popping shots by the cooldown. And it's not like players can't recreate the trailer like gameplay, it's just the game doesn't have those possibilities at it's core, and it's a shame.

Even though ships technically have a ""hitbox"" it's shown as a signature radius - the bigger the ship, the bigger the number, the bigger chance it will get hit by a weapon, of course taking into account the distance too. However, that doesn't mean you can hide behind a titan or dread with a frigates. There is no cover in space by using the cosmic objects, any object for that matter. If you were on the other side of a planet and someone had 100% hit chance from the opposite side, he will shoot right through the planet and get you. That's why you can see ships clipping into each other, instead of using ship formations. There is no cover and ships can fire through each other, so there is no point in formations at all and no worry fo friendly fire.

If there were formations and positioning of ships actually meant something, like dealing more damage or being out of a ships fire radius, this way battles would've had way more depth then now.

What about frigates instead of having to orbit at a certain distance for their turrets effective range, they would actually have dogfight manuevers that would allow for evasive tactics or strafing runs, hey they did implement a first person view from the ship. I mean it shouldn't be like in their Valkyre VR game, but somewhere close to that and Alpha players on frigates already have a way more spectacular fight then capital battles, not to mention it puts an initiative to get frigates over destroyers or cruisers.

Talking about small ships vs big ones, what about adding a hardpoint health system, similar to that of Star Wars Empire at War. Each ship has hard points, attacking certain ones will disable them. High and mid tier slot items have health so why not add a system that allows to focus certain areas? Want to make a ship fly slower, hit the engines, worse hit chance, aim for the antenna! And the amount of hardpoints with their chance of being hit depends on the ship type and size, so some ships may have bonuses that others don't and vise versa.

How about ship managment of battlecruisers and higher class ships? What about boarding enemy ships with a crew from a smaller ship? You can buy Small Arms and Marines on the market, CCP even had DUST which should have worked alongside EVE Online, so the basics are there. Why not add a crew managment for bigger ships? What, is the titan controlled by one pilot? Come on, even if they trained to know how to do it, it would be way more fun to have a crew to take care of, who can provide bonuses. Having personnel like engineers, soldiers, main ship crew members gives more initiative for immersive gameplay and when you have a damaged near death Titan you can see escape capsules ejecting into space, making it way more dramatic to lose one.

What about the environment?

I suggest reading this forum post:
https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=47868&find=unread

It covers a huge chunk of another potentially good addition into the game. But in addition to that I would like to see some more interactivity. The space is filled mainly with stations, suns, moons, gates, asteroid fields, wormholes and sites. More variety to explore the cosmos is detrimental. Something where a small side step can lead to a fun moment. An anomaly in space, enter it and you maybe end up in a week long adventure and not an 1 hour long hacking mini game or combat site cleanups.

Some may say that these suggestions the server won't be able to handle or are tedious to implement, but if CCP wants EVE to prosper and gain more players alongside keeping older ones, they have to pick a proper development path and adding at least one of these can make a bigger difference then any new update.

Sometimes I hate this game, because things can go real bad with big losses if your not carefull
On the other hand I love it because:

The game has an incredible amount of content to explore which can be very overwhelming to new players. Tackling learning the game with a level head and patience is key to enjoying it.

2. There is new player tutorial, but no hand-holding. Eve Online is a sandbox.

3. LOTS of playstyles and interest areas. Major types: mining, NPC-hunting, transporting, trade, production (over 90% of stuff in Eve is player-produced), anomaly scouting, exploration, travel / sightseeing, newbee training, role-playing, all sorts of PvP, market scams, corporation / alliance management, politics and warfare, espionage, community services (apps, websites and TeamSpeak / Mumble etc created by players).
All of those have sub-types and mixtures.

4. You're not tied to any playstyle or activity: anything you do in Eve universe is up to you. ""The choice is yours"" is not just a marketing slogan.

5. How much time to spend - is up to you.
You have endless free time and don't know how to occupy yourself? No problem: delve into pvp then any fleet activities then corporation management. Not enough? Start an alliance and micro-manage it.
Have very little free time? No problem too: there is AFK mining and trading in stations for you. Though you'll still need to learn relevant game mechanics.

6. Spreadsheets in space. It's a ""pro"" point because I like spreadsheets. :) Eve's interface partially looks like spreadsheets. Also if your main occupation in eve is any type of production / trade / anything about money - Excel or LibreOffice Calc (or whatever else) is your best friend.

7. Character development is passive. You don't need to hunt or do anything to ""level up"". Just add a skillbook to your character's skill queue and you'll learn the queued skills passively - you don't need to be online for that.

8. You can play for free and have fun. Sure, your skill progression and ship access is very limited but you can have fun in small ship-size pvp, no problem. It allows to get familiar with the game world before you decide to upgrade to paid subscription.

9. Beautiful space, ships, stations.

10. Very interesting and creative community. Eve players have created youtube channels, websites, services, PC apps, android/ios apps. There are even songs about Eve.

11. Interesting lore, with short stories about it.

12. Nothing like pay2win. You can pour real life money into this game but your expensively fitted ship will die fast. Furthermore, such ships with expensive modules in them, piloted by inexperienced players - are an easy and very welcome prey for more experienced players.
Player's skill, experience and deep knowledge of the game mechanics - that's what really matters and makes the difference between life and death.
Sure, real life money can give you some (not very sensible) bonus in game but only AFTER you gain skills, experience and deep knowledge. Rare thing for the MMO genre, I'd say.


NEUTRAL:

1. You're a newbee [strike]pilot[/strike] capsuleer until you've actively played for at least half a year. Period.

2. Character development and your progression as a player is relatively slow-paced. Even if you quickly get many skills learnt they won't help you much until you acquire actual experience.


CONs:

1. Toxicity of community. If you're sensitive to trolling, scam, griefing etc, this game might not be for you. Most of toxicity can be avoided though: find a pve corporation and stick with it.


Not many ""con""s, heh. I really like this game. The best game I've played for the lifetime (>30 y.o), and have tried a lot.

They didn't look at the market of MMO's and analyze what has been successful and try to emulate that. No. They went out and made something that was their own, a world that, for better or for worse, is their own design through and through.

The whole game drives you into a toxic, sadistic and utterly horrible community. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of good people around, but they simply won't make up for the toxicity you'll meet every time you log on. You'll usually find the best of people in Mining groups, Industri fleets/small alliances, NPC allegiance, or the small spontanious PvP groups that pops up, but lately it have been a role of dice with those PvP groups.

There's barely any PvE left - when looking past Industry and mining - that makes any sense to play and not do over and over to death. And that hurts someone like me that doesn't have the need, time, or want to run around and kill people all day to make a living. I simply refuse to join alliances, as they are - generally - so infested with the worst of the players, that you'll live for them and not for your own gameplay. As spies are a real thing here and some that can hurt an entire alliance, you only set yourself up to delete your character and all its progress, if you get to join a big alliance you can't be a part of, for one reason or another. As only the small Highsec groups will now take you in.

To be any meaningful PvE'er, you'll need to strive for Nullsec (Nullsec - No security, Highsec as described before - High security, even though that's a completely false describtion. There's 3 different types of security sectors with different - and long - explanations to them.(Highsec - Lowsec - Nullsec)) To be PvE'er in Nullsec, you'll either need dumb luck and find a place where nobody is and have been for a while, or you HAVE to join an alliance. As all the best of ressources and what you'll end up needing is out there. The entire trading economy is so borderline production-cost, that unless you have access to the materials, you'll end up losing money (ISK) trying to make your own things, or to sell off when buying raw material. That only leaves you to highsec mining or trading, but there's a huge risk with these. As there are groups out there that specifically hunt these players and are ever increasing in numbers, you are more likely to lose money than to earn them. Or, if you don't meet them often, you'll earn next to nothing anyways. 

There's plenty of fun in PvP too at times, but you'll have a hard time only doing that alone, so try and find small hunter groups. And don't expect fair fights... It's all pretty much just ganking. There's no rewards towards fairplay, but quite the opposite. Big fights like alliance battles, what are rare to be part of, can be rather tedious as they tend to last for several hours. Anywhere from 2 to 14 hours, depending on what alliances that are fighting and the importance of the fight. But as it can be a devestating defeat, or a glorious and bountiful win, makes it very exciting and you tend not to think much of the loses of ships you go through.

Don't get me started on multi account botting and macro software. Despite that the developers cracks down from time to time, it seems more like a token effort than actual countering the problem. It has always been a problem, but as the playerbase have suffered a dip, the economy is... fragile with these people around. Why much of the trading is now near production-cost. The markets never stabalized itself when the problem was at its highest, and the updates to how ressources are gained, are now overflowing the market with fleets/alliances mass production selling. 
On top of that, there have been so many people 'ratting' -killing NPC's- for ISK, that some players sit on so much cash now, that they'll never be able to spend it. They're -at times- also killing the economy with below production-cost items, just because they wan't to get rid of it. 

Most people will end up doing PvP for a daily basis. And not doing that, they'll mine with their fleet for their production, so that they can go out and PvP again.
-This is why the market never really feel the PvP fights that the 'highsec gankers' say it's good for. PvP'ers supply themselves and leaves their marks to supply themselves. The entire market is pretty much driven by newbies, solo-players and people with little time to set up the production themself, now. And that market is usually supplied by same gankers. So...

All I've seen is that the developers are still moving in a direction where they can't get more players in. Despite the increasing number of players in survival and open-world games, CCP can't make more numbers. It's either incompetence in their advertising department, or their development direction that leaves players behind.

You can't get ahead. If you choose to mine and sell your proceeds, you work like a dog for pennies. If you use your mining proceeds to build products like ships and equipment, the value of the products you make are far less than you can sell them for.

If you want to trade, you can buy items in one region and sell them in another. Except you can't move enough goods in a regular ship to make enough money to make it worthwhile. If you buy a freighter, it will get destroyed by gankers waiting at one of the jump gates 50% of the time.

If you want to just hang out and fight the NPC pirates, they're either too easy to destroy and its boring, or they mysteriously become practically indestructible and as you engage them, 3 turn into 20 ships and they disrupt your warp drive.

Everest with no training, equipment, or Sherpa to help you.  While CCP added a tutorial along with an interface to help guide players to do all the possible things to do in EVE, knowing what the hell you're looking at and understanding how to succeed is a daunting task.

Do not think you'll just jump in and be dunking people or making billions of isk (in-game currency) instantly, because that won't happen.  You will need to talk to people in game, read a lot of in game information as well as outside guides if you want to go it solo.  If you have friends or can join a corp, you can alleviate some of that burden by getting advice from veterans.

What I'm trying to get at is this game is NOT for everyone.  It's a game for mature (mentally, not necessarily how they act) individuals that are willing to invest time in learning how to play this massive game.  I've been playing for years, and I have learned a fare bit about how to succeed in EVE, however there are huge chunks of the game I still don't know.

The game is free to play, and your character can earn up to 5 million skill points as FTP, which will open a decent number of doors to do things and see what it has to offer.  So try it out.  I recommend you FTP before you invest real money into the game.

More mmos need to start embracing the true loss concept that made everything in eve so thrilling, and I think more would if WoW hadn't made the average gamer so risk averse. I have seen so many criticisms of the hard loss mechanic of EVE, apparently some people think losing your ship is equivalent to losing your character in WoW, or even just your gear. and yeah, maybe in some cases it is like losing your gear(not your character though, thats an extremely wrong analogy), but what they dont understand is that this risk is what made EVE so fun. due to a lack of real money sinks in the game it became very easy to amass enough wealth that all this risk (or a majority of it anyway) was negated and that was when the game started to lose its luster for me. as the player base started to reach incredible amounts of wealth the fun game of rock paper scissors turned into rock-paper-scissors-nuke so everyone just started to bring nukes. the lack of real sinks and money becoming too easy to earn was only made worse when they eliminated the timegate on skills. this was my first real mmo experience and it will always hold a special place in my heart, i truly hope that i will find a new mmo to fill the hole in my heart left by EVE.

If you are looking for a job, which doesn't give you money back nor joy: EVE Online is for you.

EVE Online is not a game, it's a job. And to be good at any job you need to practice, fail, succeed, learn, repeat. This is a job that will swallow all your time and money.
If you are not interested in joining a corp (that is a ""guild"") then this is NOT the game for you. Most of the game is excruciatingly boring and most corporation only do money-making schemes (mining, manufacturing etc. which takes stupid amounts of money and time). If you want to join a PvP corp, you'll need to prove you are worth it. Ever heard of catch-22? This is it.
EVE Online is the perfect simulation of how fked up our world is:
- Plenty of annoying players who will kill you because they can or that you entered on their turf.
- Huge corporations that control most of the game ""world"", and if you are not part of their alliance, you're dead.
- All other players are just carebears who are too scared to even fly outside the station.
The game can be fun if you're good, know how to play the market, know how to blow stuff up without getting ganked, and play with like-minded people. If not, this is one of the most boring ""games"" on the planet.

The cinematics look great, the graphics of the game are gorgeous, but that's it. You'll only experienced 5% of the game if you're not lucky to join a corp.

Please note, I have stopped playing EVE in 2014, after playing for 4 years, getting a T3, lossing billions of ISK on ships that got ganked in PvP, getting fired from my corp because of war declarations from another one because I went on their turf with a stealth bomber, and doing everything except Alliance warfare because I was not interested in joining the bees.

Eve can be a lot of fun, but my god is the learning curve high. I mean really high, and once you really do understand how to play, you may not enjoy it. It's certainly not for everyone, and depending on what you really want to do, you might need to pay the subscription to do it. Honestly if you don't you're only going to get so far, as it is with most every free to play game out there, but it's very true here, as you're locked off from certain skills, ships, and equipment.

The game shines if you can join a Corporation and meet people. Good luck meeting the right people, as the people you meet is going to be a crap shoot. Tons and tons of corps out there try and recruit absolutely anyone they can, so it takes some time to find the right one that suits what you want to do; be it casual or serious, the corp exists. 

It really is a massive game, and it's aged well enough; Eve stands as a testament to what other mmo games could accomplish if they have enough ambition. Eve is one of the few examples out there where the universe really IS shaped by the players in it, and unlike other mmos, it's all one server, which is a plus in my mind.

Eve is a grind like no other. Skills simply take time. You add them to a queue, and each one takes anywhere from a few minutes, to weeks, which really slows things down to a crawl if you think that it's just all about learning the curve and putting in the work. Its not. You go to the market, look for the skill, pray someone is selling it at the station you're currently at, and then you wait. Want to fly a specific ship? it's going to require knowing multiple different skills trained to various levels (1 to 5 if i remember correctly), and this is going to take you quite a long time to get together. Then afterwards you're going to need to outfit it with weapons and then outfit the weapons with ammo.

the point being, it's an incredibly complex game. If you like incredibly intricate games that require a lot of time and patience to get into, here it is. I recommend this game because I enjoy that sort of thing, but it's hard to suggest this game at the same time knowing the absolutely massive time commitment it is.

I was conflicted on whether to recommend EVE because if you have the dedication (explained below) then you'll like it but if you're a brand new player then liking it is going to be about 50/50. Remember EVE is like Marmite, you're going to love it or hate it. Even though I hate Marmite (it is evil) I quite like EVE.

I like EVE on the whole but it can be very difficult for new players to get into it before they get to the point of frustration and just quit. You can not rush this game, you can not play this game if you only have a couple of hours a week to spare. This game is definitely a marathon rather than a sprint so if you don't have the patience I would save yourself the stress and not even start because all it will lead to is you being annoyed and you writing a negative review (think in months/years of game play rather than hours/days). You need to spend hours upon hours upon hours trying to get yourself somewhere close to being able to venture into nullsec (where the big money is) without getting wiped out in about 10 seconds and even then without having someone watching your back its damn hard. 

I have found the majority of interactions with other players have either been hostile or I have been ignored which again can put you off playing so be prepared for this. I was lucky enough to have some friends playing EVE so I had an advantage. If you're on your own then dive into the missions and build as much ISK and experience you can, treat the missions as the tutorial. If you go into the game without doing the missions first then you're going to find things very hard if not impossible. 

[b]Play the free to play extensively before you even consider thinking of paying for the Omega, then really think some more[/b], also if you are going to start paying then I advise you to at least for the first few months paying for the 1 Month Omega Time rather than the subscription method, yes it costs a bit more but the big plus is you're not tied down to a subscription.

The easiest part of Eve is the game mechanics. There are several skill paths and careers. Each will take a few months (or more) to mentally learn to be proficient. However, because of a skill que, it maybe take several months or years for your capsuleer to be perfect at it. It's the binder of Eve Online.

Game mechanics are difficult and not intuitive. Just core game mechanics will take many hours to learn (about 3-5 days of actual gameplay). Once you have a solid grasp on the core mechanics one can begin specializing in a career. This is likely an entirely different game mechanic. If you've stayed around this long then you know that player corporations own Eve Online. JOIN A PLAYER CORPORATION.

The staying mechanic of Eve is the community. New capuleers need to join a like minded player corp. This is the most important part, no social anxiety allowed. Get to know the members of your corp (find a place that you enjoy and can grow). Join all corp/alliance/coalition comms, get involved. Enjoy your new Eve friends. ???. Send ISK.

Being part of a team is Eve Online's staying power.

Edit: The PvP environment is meta based. A specific ship/s will only be take on similiar class ships. Yes, there are always exceptions but the meta is fairly concrete. To become excellent at solo PvP takes a lot of time and piloting experience. Flying as a gang is the norm.

Why is that? Because CCP decided to kill the game and rise the prices higher than ever. 
This game is still fun tho, all those players who made reviews like ""bad gameplay, bad overview, toxic community"" are just stupid. I wanted say that they have a down syndrome but it would be unfair, down syndrom is a terribtle thing but yet people with it are way more smarter than those reviewers. 

Anyway, back on the topic. I respected this game for two major things - great support team (best one I have ever met) and understandings of the market. CCP had opportunities for players to pay a reasonable price via credit card (like I did all the time) or to make in-game money and trade for PLEX. It was good stuff and it kept me in their fanbase for a long time.

Nowadays, they think that game is duying (yet there were no sights of it) and they decided to kill the cow instead of get the damn milk from it. Local market is corrupted by hundreds if not more bots, prices are going to be so high there is no point to PLEX anymore AND they decided to raise the price for the game. 

Support - I made an aplication to in-game support team, last part of questions were answered back in March 2018 and nothing happened since then. I made a ticket 4 times, the answer was simple - we are working on it, wait for it. No guys, you don't work, you s**k.

CCP guys, I know you read this reviews and you don't care about a new single negative post, but trust me, you are doing it wrong. Lots of players unsubscribed just because of plex and bots, how many players would drop due to subscription price raise? 

I won't recomend to start it nowadays. Why? Bots, price, CCP. 
This game is the best one I have ever played and I am very sad to see this kind of stuff happened.",1483475245,1554492608,False,6,0,0.582721710205078125,0,True,False,False

My opinion is: 
DON'T play this game, because you will waste your time
DON'T play this game, because CCP doesn't care about your problems
DON'T play this game, because it will drive you mad.

And now in details. 
One can ask, Why do i write such a horrible comment.
My answer is there are reasons i will describe you in details.

1. Newcomer UNFRIENDLY. 
A) When you start the game, you should understand that it's an MMO and you will start from the bottom. You will spend a year  to have possibility to fly some OK ships, and use some OK modules. Sure you can try to fasten it, but it will cost you reall money for that. 
B) When you will figure your way in the game and you will think that you can do something some gang will surely BLOW you up, and you will loose some VALUABLE STUF. Surely there is some Empire police that should help you but, it always show up when you are dead, and you lost your stuff. CCP (company producer of the game) knows of the problems, but the DON'T CARE about their players. 
C) There is no good tutorial and there are 100's of possible ways, and it will take only 2 month to figure out how to play this game, you will learn only basic stuf only after 2 month of playing. 
D) There are no communities to help you, they will just try to put you in the wrong way. 

2. BUGS
There are hundreds of in-game bugs. 
- Some stuf just doesn't work like its written
- CCP make changes when you run the game, so it can affect your ship and you can just loose it and the person you are flying it with. 
- When the server get overcrowded you will have no chance to do anything, game will just NOT RESPOND and that way you can LOOSE YOUR SHIP again. (CCP knows about the problem, and they just don't buy better servers) 

3. Support
Best part.  I would name it THEY DONT CARE
1. When I wrote my ticket i waited for weeks and - no response. I think they just don't care.
2. They take NO responcibility.

AND REMEMBER EVERYTHING YOU LOOSE, YOU LOOSE FOREVER.

Verdict: just don't play this game, there is a lot of games in the world, don't waste your time here.",1554210883,1554210883,False,15,0,0.533021271228790283,10,True,False,False
8500,49790250,76561197994219561,0,27,16220,0,750,1641232720,"First, I changed my review from a neg to a positive, mostly because receiving a response from a gm shows they at least care about the game and address the specific issues.

I've had a little time to play the game so far, and other than the fact that there is still no tie between Steam and Eve (yet, that's where I paid for the omega that never got credited through Steam, but was addressed by a GM through Eve itself), the game itself deserves some praise for what it does, especially considering it's been around as long as it has.

The interface of the game, a week or so into playing it, still leaves a lot of confusion, but slowly I'm working my way through a lot of the issues (not all, but through most).

One area I haven't addressed so far (cause I had no experience with it) is the community within the game. There's a new player section in chat that I've found to be a brilliant design as part of the game because the information is so helpful. Sometimes, I just sit and read the chat there and I learn things about the game that I didn't know what a part of it. That's helped me learn a lot of things so far.

Granted, I'm still a noob, but I'm learning.

I am going to be giving this a negative rating but with reservations. Let me start by explaining my negative rating reasons and then I'll go into some positives.

Negative:
1. My one major reason for giving this a negative rating on Steam is that the game isn't actually on Steam. I bought the game here, thinking it would allow me to play it here, but then my purchase never even was acknowledged by Eve, so I had to go through a week or so of customer service just to get my 3 month Omega purchase to show up. By then, I had given up and just bought the Omega time on Eve's servers, and then they credited the 3 months in addition, meaning that if I didn't like the game, I was now obligated into 6 months of playing a game I might have given up on after the first few weeks.

2. The lack of information in the game is really annoying. And I mean simple things. Like how to target enemies. I had to find out from the forums how to actually target someone. Not in the game. I'm sure it's somewhere in the game, but I never saw it. And still haven't. Plus, I have yet to figure out how to even know how powerful an enemy is. An example: Some of the early agent missions have you kill sentinel enemies, which is really simple. All i can tell you is that they were big, they shot at me and did little damage, and then they died quickly. I was doing some mining later, saw someone red (enemy npc) coming at me, and decided to defend myself. I seriously died. Still don't really know how I would have known he was much tougher than me,. Basically, it felt really random to me. I'll bet there's a simple way of knowing that. I have yet to figure out how. I'm sure I'll find out in a forum post somewhere down the line, but that should NEVER be how you find out information in a computer game. Yet, it's becoming more and more of the known, so much that people will actually tell you that's how you find out. Really bad design.

3. The HUD. There are so many things wrong with it that I'm sure others have figured out how to fix it. Would be nice to know what those solutions are.

4. The economy. It's there. Somewhere. And to some people, I'm sure it makes sense. Again, I'll have to get this information from a forum or web site somewhere. Someone told me to watch Youtube videos. Yeah, bad design that people will say is not a bad design cause everyone does that.

5. No idea what exactly Omega is, unless it's just the monthly access. Not sure if it offers any further benefits cause NONE of the information on their site explains it. It's just there. And you should pay for it, cause, it's there. I've assumed it's their monthly fee, but part of me wonders what benefits it brings because a free account gets access, too. Just not sure what the difference is. I'm sure people have figured this out through osmosis, but better explanations would make this more of a streamlined process. I'm sure someone will complain that the info is there, somewhere, but again, even hidden in plain site is still hidden.

The good, so far:

1. It's not No Man's Sky, which to me is Space Lite that keeps getting improved to where it's almost Space Medium with the fantasy of one day being Space Heavy. There are a lot of complicated parts to the machinery that is Eve Online, and when you finally get through one of the pieces of it, it feels great. I figured out how to actually target stuff the other day. That was awesome. I hated not being able to do it before, but once you've figured it out, it feels great. Probably should have felt great from the moment I started playing it, but it's just one of those things.

2. The game is beautiful. Yeah, it is. There are a number of times where I flew through the neighborhood and thought, wow, that's awesome.

3. The devs seem to be heavily involved in maintaining and improving the game. And it's been out over a decade, so that's impressive. Most games fall apart long before that, or get bought out and then steamlined for microtransactions. So, that's also great.

4. I reserve this space to fill in with so many other things, but I'm still pretty new, so it's still all very difficult for me now. Sure, months from now I'd probably think differently but it's important to point out the problems of a game at the beginning before I become jaded and criticize the new person for coming along and being clueless like I am today.",1553701389,1553869643,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

If you can get into a decent Corp, the fleet actions and industrial espionage seem to be where the fun is at, but you can also be on the other side and lose everything in seconds, without any real way to defend against it.

I quit many years ago and haven't been tempted to return.

This game is the truest pvp experience available but hardly enjoyable to all. NOT snowflake friendly! The negative reviews are emotional and unreliable!

True pvp which will utlimately cost or gain you actual money, yes, actual money equates to ingame currency. Suprised? hello realism. Make no mistake, there have been people spending thousands of dollars in one instance on their ingame characters (skill injectors) or assets thereof. When you start the game fresh as a new player, you are infantismal vs the settled and veteran EVE playerbase. Just consider yourself a tiny fish thrown in the ocean, where whales, sharks and other smart fish references roam daily life. 

Remember though, there is always a bigger fish!

Feel turned off? Don't be! No other FREETOPLAY game gives you a better opportunity to fight the burgoise. A task not set upon those weakhearted enough to ragequit and then cryout on steam by posting negative reviews just because their feelings are hurt. I get it ok, u feel bad after you've decided to take a risk with high stakes (like going all-in with gambling) and then it all fails miserably because of something you could have prevented or something! Instead of reflecting on your own mistakes, you ragequit. Its like people raging out of a casino when they have made a really stupid bet and having lost everything. Do not fly what u cannot afford to lose. Where most games have zero consequences to not giving af and just allows for moronic risktaking, this one doesnt'

When you'll start understanding the game more, within 2 weeks, u can easily learn how to fight other newbro's, compete amongst them and get your bearings as what career to pursue. 

(To the snowflakes: The spaces where newbro can orient themselves in could be considered 'safe spaces' with the Concord NPC police to protect you're hurt feelings by the use of force. You're going to love it!)

You as a new player are NOT likely to get 'picked on' by veteran players at all. Simply put..You really are not worth their time.

After some time....Kill a target worth 500+ mil isk then the feels are good. Think this is impossible? It isn't. You can max out specific ships fairly easily. Alot involves knowledge of the various ship/damage types, their counters, best defenses etc. Not interested getting to know all that stuff? We look forward to reading your negative steam review.

Great Game. Except for snowflakes and people flying shuttles filled with plex into null or beyond. This game is filled with jerks? No silly! It's actual people protecting what's theirs or taking over stuff which is claimed by someone else because reasons. Actual life is within the meta. You can't protect anything when planning a family holiday involving being offline for a whole month or so. You, and I, cannot imagine the things that have been done to aleviate such real life issues within and for this game. And thats just namign one example.

In no other game are the stakes as high as here. 80% of everything you encounter, or see while piloting your ship, can be claimed by players & will be fought over and losing stuff will fill you're eyes with tears. Such is the investment in this game. This means you need friends, but nobody ultimately is you're actual friend perse. Betrayal, deception and scamming are daily excercises to some players. Past results are NO garantee for the future. However, don't forget such betrayals can also be forced decisions. Like not wanting to lose access to a mining spot (say, you're whole character is made for mining and that is what you do) because of ingame relation demands. In the end, we are mostly all strangers to eachother playing a game online. This game is the truest pvp experience available, but hardly enjoyable to all. Space isn't for the meek!

It is immeasurably vast and complex, there is no other game like it. You can trust me on this because any experienced player will tell how much they wish there was a game like it. I've run large corporations of old and new players alike and I am painfully familiar with those first 20 hours. Which is also why I feel the need to write a review.

EVE has always been a sandbox game, arguably it's the oldest and most battleworn sandbox MMO there is. You need to leave your preconceptions of what an MMO should be at the door, this game will not conform. If you want to be the biggest baddest solo mercenary there is, you'll soon find your first encounter a mixture of elevated heart rate, panic and profuse sweating. You'll throw tantrums and sulk about how crap the game is, how unfair it is, and probably 1 in 50 of you who actually try this game will make it through whilst others give up before they've even begun.

This game is hard, because once you've spent months finally getting a feel for how your view of the game universe works, you realise that the real content, is you. Nobody is playing the same game, that's the difficult concept to grasp.

You are responsible for what you get out the game. If you sit in high-security space mining for Omega, or simply run NPC missions - that's fine, but that's what you choose to put in. The game is a toolbox, and with it you create an economy, a political landscape, reasons to play. There is no purpose to anything in the game other than what you make of it, because that's what this game is.

On the surface of it, I run a finance company in EVE. I dabble in wormhole gameplay, occasional PvP and industry. The game doesn't provide me this in the form of a shining beacon, a quest which says 'do this' or 'do that'. No, I choose to play like I do because that's the game I want to play, and the game allows me to do that. The thing that makes it so good is that even though I'm playing my own game, I can invite others to play it with me, because that's what the game is.

Your ship is a consumable. Decisions take time. There is no instant gratification.

So when you play EVE - remember the game is just a petri dish, a giant micro-culture that's grown out of real players with real actions and consqeuences, with their own motivations and interests.

Is this a good game or not? the short answer is yes, but ..

we start with you, what are you looking for in a space game, Eve has it all but it is not easy. 
No it requires more than you think but has a lot to give you. 

I have some games that I pick up after a few months to play and do so from time to time. 
Eve is something i always play, i might be off for a few days or weeks but then i must have it!
it´s easy to jump in and do some ratting or mining or to check how your trading is doing but mostly just to talk a little with my online friends, ""corpies""  but i have played the game for years. 
and this is something that will take some time to be good at, the game mechanics I mean the friend part is almost instant.
You can play alone, fly different types of missions, trading or build things to have fun 
but it is a bit difficult to make it work.
Eve's online is what it says. a multiplayer game. It's not you against all other players, it's a ""we against them"".

-But I don´t know anyone who plays Eve?

In Eve there are thousands of small and large groups of players 
and the community in a ""corp""  is incredibly fun and rewarding.
It is as I said, thousands of different groups playing together and probably your language is represented to. 
and as always gritty/bad English also works =)
that's what makes Eve in my opinion ""The best space game so far""

Big words for a game that when I started with it was impossible, ridiculously difficult and 
frustrating.
you buy a ship that you can sit in, 2 minutes later you are dead.
what is this for junk?

A tip from me, don´t buy anything you can´t loose a few times..
and for some the game there are playing is a spy game or a gamling game.  
eve is free to shape as you like it to be.
and being a fool will cost you something you don´t want to loose. = )
But difficulties make you challenge yourself. should I give up or try again? your choice.

These days there are good guides in the game to make you understand the basics. 
But you can also use Twitch or YouTube, they have lots of ""guides"" who can help you get started.

If you think you know what Eve is after 3 days in the game, you are wrong this game requires planning and time. 
Not much time every time you play, but over a long period.

Understand me right, there is a lot to do from day one but when a game is fun 2,5 or even 10 years after the first time you played it you might understand how incredibly big and rewarding this game is.
You can learn almost everything about one part and then find a hundred new things you know nothing about.

If you think you have what it takes to cope with Eve Online.
Eve Online will give you many fun and rewarding moments ..

And best said from the developers of the game,

I opted for wormhole exploration but there is minning, corporate management and manufacturing. Now do do this you need skills and you learn them by finding or buying the skill book and train the skill. This is the main time factor it could take 5 to 30 min real life time to learn a level 1 skill and to use that big fancy gun you need level 3, that along could take 3 days real time to learn luckly once your training the skill it will continue to do so offline.

EvE is good doing its own thing at that may not be what you want the bottom line is you dont simply get in a ship and go pew pew bad guys and get awsome loot. This can feel like a 2nd life sometimes its that detailed.

I will now leave you with one golden rule of EvE that I learned the hard way ""Never fly what you can't affored"" meaning if you spend all your isk (game currency) into that one badass ship and it gets blowen up you now have nothing to replace that ship.

I am no expert on this by far if you want the game is free to play give it a go and if you do like it maybe worth upgarding to a paid sub but if you didnt like it you didnt waste any money.

The learning curve is one of the most hardest one to master and there's a lot of gameplay elements and stuff to do. However, this is a bad thing if it's really hard to understand and it takes ages to actually see what's going on and what possibilities you have as a player. And believe me, the tutorial is nothing special and it's mostly confusing.

Economy is basically the most deepest and the most realistic economy I have ever seen in a videogame. It gives you basically free market capitalist economy where players have effect on prices and players keep the stocks alive and list everything you can buy. It's the closest thing I can imagine to real life and like wars and mining have a huge impact on everything. This is how it should work on EVERY MMO scifi game and maybe on every MMO aswell, where players have actual impact on economy and where you should invest your money on. 

The combat guys... The combat... In my mind it's not great, it's mostly justmicromanagement stuff. It's not like in Elite Dangerous's combat where you must control every move of your ship and master your ship's handling + controls. It's like, press this button at this moment and let your ship do all the rest. IT's not deep and in my mind it's not fun and rewarding.

PVP is the THING in this game. I must say, it might be the most Pro-PVP MMO out there and it evolves around it. Most of the fun stuff comes from PVP (atleast what i have heard) and joining guilds are actually must have things to do. So this is also a problem, because if you like PVE and you aren't interested in PVP, you have a pretty big chance that you will not like this game. Elite Dangerous in other hand gives this freedom to actually play solo, in squads/wings, join to player groups and still it maintains that good PVP/PVE balance where you can actually solo things and have a blast. EVE Online is totally different tho.

Skill learning is bad and it belongs to Free-to-Play mobile game. No sub-game should ever, ever, ever, EVER have this kind of thing where you must train your skill for DAYS and still get very little from it. Almost every module requires skills to master and it's time grinding at its best. Again, in Elite Dangerous only money is required to actually use your equiment, because no skill training is needed and only buying ship/module gives you instant access to play it. No skill training grind needed and it's still a lot better than this free-to-play as* mechanic. In Elite Dangerous YOUR, the player's skill is more important than waiting for days to actually play something. EVE Online really dissapoints in this area. Also microtransactions in a sub game. Absolutely dissapointing.

Visuals, voices, music, the game world and overall ships are great. Ships have a good varianty to them and factions have their own ships. Some are better on shield tanking while other might rely on speed and missles. It's great and I think that while it's not that big universe, it's really rich and beautiful universe to play in and the overall lore is good. 

However in my mind it's not great space MMO. The steep learning curve, bad tutorials, no total freedom to choose between PVE and PVP drives players like me quicky away from EVE Online, bad skill system, really outdated controls, sub game which actually feels like a free-to-play mobile game (you have a change to play as free-to-play character but it's not as good as sub character and free-to-play account has a lot limits which just beg you to pay sub), microtransactions, community is not that great compared to games like Warframe but it's not the worst around there.
However the conomy and content are good, because players have actual inpact on A MMO GAME and EVE Online gets new content really often and that's nice to see. However in my mind it's not that great game OVERALL and those cons need to be fixed on a sub based game.",1462707951,1545908896,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

This is one of the best games ever made in the sci-fi/space-ships domain , in the genre.
While it is not as arcade-y as let's say No Man's Sky , Osiris: New Dawn
or Space Engineers / Empyrion- Galactic Survival ( in those you can build your space-ship block-by-block, angled stuff,panels, motors,rotors , etc)  , while it is not as arcade-ish as those and other similar ones, and people call this game ""spreadsheet simulator"" , EvE online is exactly like a friend once described it to me ,it is like playing Chess with a thousand pieces.

Now the Pay2Win they say eih?

You can do incursions (40-man elite fleets,  ""dungeons"" like in the fantasy mmorpgs like World of Warcraft,Everquest2,Elder Scrolls Online etc , you have your dedicated tanks , healers, snipers, dps ships ) , in high-security sector space so it's relatively safe [ you just need to not use extra bling ships modules vs suicide gankers AND you must watch out for not having your corporation WarDecked (guild/clan - corporation in EVE ) . WarDeck is war declaration, clan vs clan can initiate that or alliances vs alliances etc , and EVE's Police, the CONCORD  won't interfere to help in high-sec space for the PVP.   So , you can do Incursions , get 100-120 millions ISK (interstellar kredits the game's money)  PER HOUR ,even MORE up to 200-300 depends on what ships you further train on to invest in and what fleets you run with.
With said money you can buy with usually 1 billion ISK or up to 1,2-1,3 bill isk OMEGA ( the PLEX pilot license extension before EVE was free2play) , then you have access to ALL the skills to train and ships etc.
And you can buy Skill Injector for like 500,000 Skillpoints per use (the large injector,there are smaller ones as well) , one skill injector is like 600-725 ~  millions isk.
That way you can boost your character very fast,train him for stuff like Stealth Bomber ships (Nemesis , Manticore etc ), 
Proteus , Tengu , 
Astero and the upgrade Stratios,
whatever ships you desire, Interceptors tacklers et cetera.

There is also stuff you can do if you get bored of Incursions, incursions have the steady income of ISK ( + Loyalty Points you can exchange to some space-stations for various Ship Skins/other goodies and you can sell those to players for more ISK),  while the incursions have a steady income if you ever get bored,
you CAN do VERY NICE ISK with - Exploring , hacking Data modules + Relic modules,

Gas Cloud Harvesting ( the skillbook is a bit expensive between 24 and 28 millions ISK but its very cheap for what it does to help you) , you can do Ninja Gas Cloud Harvesting in wormholes space ,10-20 minutes before the ancient "" Sleepers "" ships appear you warp-out , a full cargo of the ninja gas cloud harvesting Venture is like 100 millions isk,depends on which gases you found in your expeditions.
There is also the Venture's more expensive upgrade https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Prospect the Prospect and you need Omega upgrade for your pilot character so you can learn CLOAKING devices, it can fit a Covert Ops Cloaking Device ,this means you can warp even while you are cloaked away from danger,into stargates et caetera.
Watching those nebulaes while gas cloud harvesting is more beautiful than mining rocks in my humble opinion But if you choose you can also mine rocks  / do Ice-Mining with the Procurer ship , https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Procurer
or the Covetor ship https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Covetor 

or basic Venture ship you could do semi-AFK mining in high-security sector space while watching tv series/movies/playing other games et caetera.
This image i once seen in a corp chat,guild's chat, shows a good amount of things you can do in the game https://eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg , but sadly a lot of people just do some mining and don't like it & uninstall the game when there is so much you can do in it.
With the new skill injectors you can reach a highly trained character very easily so you can reach older players in training with a bit of actually trying to do so.

EVE Online is one of those in depth quirky games that peaks all my interests in 1 game.

The Pros (IMO)
- Its huge
- Its heavily customisable
- A wide range of activites
- Many active players, most of which still help you rather than 
blast you with your eleventeen million killmails
- A (now functional) tutorial

The Cons (IMO)
- The subscription for players with heaps of SP 
- You're never technically safe anywhere
- A few douchebag corps *ahem* pandemic *ahem*
- STEEP AS SHIT LEARNING CURVE

I just didn't really want to get sucked in to any MMORPGs and be stuck paying a subscription. But I finally caved during a $5 steam sale in 2013. Cut to about five and a half years later and it's my main game--the one I play nearly every day, the one that in the end SAVES me money since there's so few other games I have time to fit into my gaming schedule.

It's certainly not for everyone. It's very unlike the fantasy MMOs I've tried (which number only 2: WOW and Rift). Many will say you have to join a corporation to find people to do things with, but that's not entirely true. There's plenty of things to do on your own, things you will end up doing in concert with others no matter what (like anything on the player-driven market), and also plenty of things you can do casually with people in groups that exist to do various PVP and PVE activities in game that you don't need a corp or alliance for (NPSI or ""Not Purple, Shoot It"" groups for the most part).

I enjoy at least a little of everything, variety appeals to me. And while it also helps that I don't mind the grind of much of the PVE combat in the game (many do, though), there's enough varying acitivities in the game that even if you burn out on one and need a break for awhile, there's so many others out there. Game's been going for 15 years now, I missed out on the first 10 but am glad to have lived the last 5. Since it's free to play (in a limited fashion) now, there's no reason not to try it out at least if you're curious like I was many years ago. Give it a shot, see if it sticks.",1543210473,1543210473,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Eve Online and Texas Hold Em poker are the only 2 games that give me an adrenaline rush, and this is because of the risk involved. If you die in Eve you lose everything you were carrying with you especially if you have implants (in game item that are every expensive and increase how fast you gain skills) it can be very expensive. Some people might think this is a bad thing why spend 100 hours playing a game if you can lose everything, but if you ask me thats what makes it fun.

I tend not to pick on other players and try and be helpful whenever I can but in Eve hardly anyone is like this, expect to be ganked and attacked everywhere you go. (They say if you stay in high security space your safe, but in my experience if you carrying over 100 mil worth of stuff people will attack you even there.)

Another part of what makes the game unique and different to me is that this game is like the real world. The universe is a big place and a lot of people are already established and powerful, and just like in real life you are a nobody, getting dumped into a world full of billionaires and cut-throat competition with hardly any resources or help and expected to make your own way to the top. This is a breath of fresh air over most games out there where everyones a hero in an even level battlefield where skill matters more than time invested. Yes its going to seem unfair that 10 year old veterans with all of their skills are going to beat you, but what makes it most satisfying to me is that feeling of always having to watch your back, and that adrenaline rush you get when trying to escape from someone or battling away in space or the marketplace. 

I have spent many years in Eve, I have many more hours than Steam displays since this game was released years before the Steam Store even included Eve, I can tell you this. Eve will seem boring at first to most people, but there is no other game similar to Eve out there, with a persistent world economy thats actually good, and a shared universe with so many people on the same server. Sometimes I feel most MMO's don't deserve that label, they all have heavily instanced maps and they are more like small group party games rather than real MMO. 

Might aswell give Eve a try, theres an option to play it for free with restrictions to try the game out, to be honest, its a very good idea to play using the free account anyway until you have maxed your skills, thats more than enough time to decide for yourself wether this game is worth the subscription fee.

1 rule in Eve:  Only fly what you can afford to lose, same as in Poker you dont put all your bankroll in one bet.

Edit: CCP fired most of it's community development team. I'd keep my wallet closed until the dust settles from these firings and the changes to the F2P model coming soon.

Edit 2: Do to the current trend in game development, I can no longer recommend this game. The development has floundered as CCP pursues more microtransactions. I honestly believe they're killing their golden goose to fund their next boondoggle.

First: Eve is a complex game. It has a really steep learning curve for new players, although the devs have been working hard to make it a little more newbro friendly. The have added a lot of new fancy tutorials that did not exist when I started. This is definitely a big plus if you are brand new. However, do not expect them to teach you everything. This game is beyond expansive, and you will get lost in the complexity. However the newbie channel chats, forums, and sometimes even local chat can be a big help. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Usually someone is more than willing to answer.

Second: Eve is not always a nice place. One of the first things you should know, as many people as there are out there willing to help you, there are just as many willing to take advantage of you. Whether that takes the form of stealing your stuff, killing you, or picking on you, it can, and will happen. Take every offer of help with a grain of salt, or if it is a business deal, be especially careful. This kind of behavior is completely legal in Eve because it is a sandbox. The creators don't regulate anything that does not violate the EULA. It's pretty much anything goes here.

Third: Playing Eve solo sucks. Some people do it, but it's lame when you do it that way. Eve was built to be a social game and a social experiment. After you finish the tutorials, I highly suggest joining a player corporation. As a new player, I highly suggest joining a newbro friendly corp like Eve University, Pandemic Horde, or Red vs Blue. Eve Uni will teach you anything you want to know about Eve, and Horde and RvB are PvP oriented if you want to jump into that niche. 

Fourth: The skill training happens in real time. That means skills will continue to train even when you are not logged on. Also as a result, it can take a really long time to train certain skills. Playing for four years, and I have only recently started getting into capital ships. Do not expect to jump right in and be awesome at the game. You will fight and struggle and die, a lot. However, Eve is one of the most satisfying games ever if you stick with it. You don't have to have all the skills to be good, and you don't have to train everything. Just be patient with the progression and stick with it. If you are looking for the instant gratification of a shooter or action game, you best look elsewhere. Eve is a game that lends itself to the longview, and definitely has a delayed gratification factor. 

Fifth, and finally: Eve is awesome. Whether or not you like it is usually dependent on your personality, but regardlesss of whether or not you like it, it is an impressive world that the devs have made. Its a living, breathing community that makes its own story. Players decisions can affect thousands of other players. The market is run by the players, and wars between massive player coalitions shake both individual players, and the player driven markets. The PvP is the most exhilirating I have ever encountered, and I still get an adrenaline rush when taking ships into battle. (I'm very much PvP centered, so I have done quite a bit.) Eve is unlike any MMO you have ever played, or ever will play. It is singular, and I think you should at least give it a shot. If you don't like it, that's okay. It's not for everyone. If you do though, it can be a very rewarding experience and you will make some great friends. Have fun and fly dangerous!
P.S I have stopped playing Eve through Steam, but I am still very active.

Update:

Eve has gone free to play with some restrictions, and I think it was the right move. Now people can try it and see of they like it before making a monetary commitment. Abyssal deadspace has been a big addition, and the graphics are constantly being upgraded. New player controlled structures are slowly replacing the old structure system and I think that is also a move in the right direction. There has never been a better time to play Eve.

The main thing you need to know about this game - this is real MMO, so if you want to have fun and good emotions from EVE you definitely should socialize and find good corporation/alliance. 
If you want single player game - you can find EVE too boring:
- You need to learn required skills for very long time, you can expect half a year to fly ship what you want with proper skills
- Missions/complexes are mostly the same, after 1 week you will know them by heart
- Content available to solo player is not so big. You still can mine or explore if you want.

But if you find good corpmates, you will get infinite fun:
- Shit talks on teamspeak or discord are awesome. You can make IRL friends from this game
- Participating in big fleets can be fun (if not laggy)
- Corpmates at general can help you with logistics or advices how to fit ship or do PvE
- You can produce required ships or modules to alliance like a tycoon and even build whole titan in one run
- You can do all the same as you do like solo player also.

Over there it's still best game in spaceships category. There is hundred ships that looks different with different weapons for different roles. Graphics part of this game is also good, you can see very beautiful places if you pay attention. Game's lore is deep, all 4 main races have different story as well as pirat factions. Even for simple ore has own name and you can find funny text like ""Azure plagioclase was made infamous in the melancholic song prose Miner Blues by the Gallentean folk singer Jaroud Dertier three decades ago."" (you can compare it to T5 resource fantasy in Albion Online)

So mine tl;dr:
- If you want solo content game can be slow and boring to you
- If you don't like full loot games, this game would heart you

- If you like MMO gameplay (not like TESO but real MMO) this game is for you
- If you like to discover and dive deep to lore - this game is for you
- If you like spaceship games - this game is for you
- If you like hardcore full loot games this is only choice for you",1541013257,1541013257,True,3,0,0.502899765968322754,0,True,False,False

They are basically pushing out anyone who has worked hard on anything in this game. And well basically saying ***k Off we dont care about you the customer. So I really cannot reccomend to anyone to give them more undeserved money. You WILL regret it.

I feel bad for all the players that missed out playing back when it was actually worth sinking every minute in to, however those days are gone now. With a dwindling player base that has fallen in to rapid decline it is really hard to see this game lasting much longer without a SERIOUS overhaul.

I personally would love to start throwing my money back at CCP, but with their current staff and ""Direction"" that can really only be described as stabbing the community in the back. It just doesn't really sound like a promising arrangement now does it?

All in all I have about 5k Hours in this game and stuck with it hoping it would save face but sadly I just dont see that happening.

Edit 10/01/2016 
Looked friday night 7pm EST. 7k players online. Sad, it used to be around 60k, proves even further that CCP gives 0 fucks about its playerbase.
 
10/27/2018
Still around somehow, the advent of  ""Free"" to play seems to have saved it for a short while. Keep in mind that the free limits you from flying 75-80% of the ships and not being able to train most skills. AND if you already had those skills or ships, you can no longer use them without paying and you can no longer train any skills because you are over the ""free cap"" and are required to spend real $ to progress. 
Very sad.
If you're thinking of playing casual to get ISK to purchase ingame time be advised that now with the incredibly broken marketplace and the new plex system your looking at 1.3billion isk for 30 days of game time. Thats not pheasiable for large corps with active paying members let alone a new player stuck in a venture since you cant use anything bigger without paying.

EVE Online has been the only MMO I have consistently picked up and put back down over the last 10 years and for good reason. Set in one of the largest MMO sandboxes every created, EVE puts the player into the shoes of one of New Eden's elite, rogue, capsuleers. After a relatively short tutorial, which hasn't been around for too long, the player is dropped into this vast universe with nothing more than a small nudge towards your typical mmo ""quests"" or missions. Players then have numerous routes that they can delve into, such as exploration, mining, manufacturing, transport, faction warfare, marketing, planetary interaction, piracy, and so much more. A lone player could mine ores, transport them to a manufacturing facility, acquire blueprints on the market, build a ship along with modules and ammo, and then fly that into low security zones for pvp action. However, EVE Online is a very social game. Going through the process to create your own ship would be time consuming and save very little if you factor in how much your time is worth. Why mine the materials when you can buy them for a faction of the price off the market? Why haul to the manufacturing station yourself? Put out a transport contract and have some sap do it for you. Matter of fact, why even build the ship when it only costs 10% more to buy the ship out right and skip the 6 hour build queue. Why fly into solo pvp when you could join a large corporation and fly as a lineman in an armada? Don't like the idea of being around anyone? Scan down a wormhole and hop into the areas of space where no man dares tread and those....things....that do constantly hunt. Stop playing the newest theme park MMO and craft out a slice of one of the longest standing sandbox games out there.",1540176843,1540176843,True,46,3,0.802529036998748779,3,True,False,False

I dont play any more, even when I did I had found a way to play for free with in-game items (at the cost of having to grind my ass off 6 days a week) so I havent supported the game in years, but I still feel......fuggin' SOMETHING about the game, not sure what.

Eve is older than WoW, it has hung in there for a long time now, 2003.  I don't know if Eve will survive for many more years or if its beginning to breathe its last, on any forum out there someone is predicting that MMO X is about to die....but even if you dont give a shit to PLAY Eve (and any normal person should stay away), you should google some of the stories that came from it; the guild-to-guild espionage, the in-game economy being under Mafia-esque control, the collapse of the player-run bank, the literal corruption of some of the developers, the territory wars of GoonFleet, all that stuff.....I suspect that you wont get the chance to read stuff like that about many games in the future.

I almost never try to tell anyone that they should play Eve because the learning curve is effectively a straight vertical line, and because it is in many ways a glorified spreadsheet of a game, and because it takes a special brand of nerd (like myself) to fully enjoy.... so much of what made Eve interesting was in Ventrilo chats or external forum posts and the like, Eve was (for better or worse) defined by the people who played it in a way that no other MMO I have ever seen can be, including WoW or City of Zeroes. 

I made friends in Eve, over the course of my 3000+ hours (ignore my Steam time, Eve was cool before Steam) that I still keep in contact with today (two of which are reading this review), and even though we are from different parts of the planet we can sorta come together in our memories of the crazy shit that went down.  I know that such things can happen in other MMOs, but even if you watched Lord British catch fire that day, that aint SHITAKE compared to the Goons vs Band of Brothers war in Eve and what it meant to be there and be a cog, however small, in that machine.

So if you get bored one day, go read about what some of my fellow Eve misfits experienced (and inflicted on one another, you think spawn-camping demomen are bad go fuck with some low-sec jumpgate-camping pirates, or BE one of those asshat pirates, and shake the hand of your victim as he blows up, give him tips on how to avoid such fates as you loot his stuff), and remember how you used to chat with friends about how cool it would be to do THAT in a video game.",1539844604,1539849814,True,44,5,0.7745552659034729,0,True,False,False

Fundamentally this is a fantastic game. Graphics are epic. Storyline and community are awesome. The ships are diverse and fun to fly.

However given the hours on record I'm still a noobie. The community is cut throat. If you can't keep up your cut, most likely with all your gears being stolen prior to being ejected from the clan.
Post p2w if you go anywhere ""not safe"" you get nerfed by gate campers who 1 shot you.

W-Space is the equivalent to Eve's wild west where civilisation is something you only ever visit for spare, repairs and fuel for your spacestation.  It's a source of good small scale pvp, and good ISK (Or it used to be.).  

So there I was collapsing a wormspace hole with my hole-folding battleship when a cheeky local decided to take a pot shot at with their Rattlesnake battleship  (A rather expensive bit of kit back in the day). 

""Hark,""  I thought ""The lowly curf is standing in the way of a fresh hole for me to pillage for ISK""

I retreated, spectulating on what to do about said ruffian. 

Then my corp mates logged on one-by-one and I told them of the shiny, shiny expensive battleship that was ripe for the taking. 

So we plotted and planned.

...

""Oh, no one is going to intefer with me.   No, siree!""   I said to myself in a rather cheerful way as I tempted fate, jumping back through the hole in my battleship.

There the Rattlesnake stood, still waiting for me to be dumb enough to come through a second time. 

So I did what anyone acting panicked would do and burnt back to the hole, praying my ship would hold up as I did my best panicked noob impression.  

He took the bait, following me in a chase, knowing that once I jumped back through to my home system he had a chance to catch me out and destroy my ship at his leasure.

What he didn't do is pay attention to how little mass the Wormhole had left on it before it went critical and collapsed, cutting off that solar system from my home system.   It was wibbly.  It was very, very wibbly.

So I jumped back through to home, and he followed thinking he'd get an easy kill.

What he hadn't seen was the bare bones battleship sitting on our side ready to stick it's after burner on and jump through.   You see, dear reader, in Eve Online a ship with an active propulsion module increased it's mass when jumping through a wormhole.   Instead of being the equivalent of a single Battleship, it was now equivalent to 1.5 battleships in Mass.  

There was the sign of a jump as I entered into system, and then a second as he followed.

And then the shouts of ""Go!  Go!  Go!  Jump, Dark!""

In a second, our suicide battleship jumped with it's afterburner on and critted the hole, collapsing it in an intant.  Trapping the Rattlesnake, and it's pilot in our home system with half a dozen ships looking to add an expensive battelship to their killboard.

....

And that is why Eve has such passionate fans - The emergent gameplay is unmatched by any other MMO.

There is no other game like it - literally in terms of it's technology, it's gameplay, it's metagame and it's community. but it is deep, wide and complex, and to be honest, once you are involved with the making-a-space-empire aspect,  75% of the game happens outside of the client and within discords / mumble / teampspeaks. Ultimately it's about building a space empire - and a real one - maybe not real as in space, but real as in dealing with people and succesfully creating the structures, philosophy and politics that can bind a group of 1000+ players together to be able to survive as a community with a specific goal, and projecting power within the game to defend yourselves while you play the game as you want to.

 Steam says I've played ~100 or so hours. Last time I checked actual play time it was approaching 10,000hours and that was a few years ago. I've not bothered checking since.  I've played Eve for 13 years and I'm only going to stop the day that Eve is turned off.  - in all that time, Ive won & lost in the game, made friends and lost them - in game. But we'll all meet up IRL for a beer and laugh about how we beat each other into the dust. 

If you are going to play Eve bear in mind it's the game outside the game that keeps you here, while the game itself offers you plenty to discover and understand for literally years in the meantime.  Don't expect instant gratification - then again, if you're smart or charismatic you can rise up within Eve's story rapidly.  Join and and become part of the story - the single unique story that is Eve, your actions will reverberate through the game. There is only one instance of Eve, and what you do within it makes your mark. Be a solo industrialist. Be the guiding light of an Economic powerhouse. Be the figurehead and ruler of 5000 other nerds.  be the best small gang group of friends winning fights outnumbered. Ransom the weak, or kill them, or make friends with them. Challenge the strong and win, or loose and try again. Or just infiltrate them and steal everyhting.. It's up to you.

All these things happen with the background of a space opera. Find your place. 

To win, you need to be a leader.  To make your mark you need to be special. To play, you just need to be here. There is nothing else like Eve.

There are no respawning bosses in Eve - though for sure there is high end PvE content - but it is secondary to the real game of writing Eve's story.. There is no raid content.  In Eve the bosses you fight are other groups of players. A raid is beating them out of their space with skill, command and organisiation. - Or it is the markets you manage to corner and milk for every drop of profit. Or the ideologies you hold and bring to bear that bind your friends together and drive them to success.

As for the grind, or the no-grind.  .. if you find yourself grinding then you are doing it wrong. The real progression in Eve is figuring out - literally finding any way to play you can - how to play without the grind.

In Eve the grind is a lie, if you're doing it you should be trying to figure out how not to do it. And the key to that is people. Play with the other people in the game, don't just play with the game :)

For example, I can tell you how to make enough ISK within 3 months that you will never need to pay real money to play the game ever again.  It took me 3 years to figure that out. And  3 more to get around to trying, and 3 more to do it properly. But without a word of a lie, you can do it within 3 months. but then again.. it might not be how you would like to play, but thats your choice. Do it your way and win :)

I came back a decade later and I can fully appreciate the game for what it is. Yes, its a grind. Yes, its slow paced and monotonous, but deep down, I kinda like it. Its not that the game is boring, its because it always has something for me to do. Within the first 3 days of playing again, I omega'ed on the 4th day I realized that having only 1 account was going to be a setback. So I created 3 more. That is 3 times the income and its good to start their training early. I was like ""Dam"" how am i gunna pay for these guys?"" I then found 50% off sales, humble bundle, etc. That cut prices from ""iffy"" to ""dam thats a steal"" I got 5 months of omega for 20 dollars for my main and scouring the web for discounts, packs, etc. I even signed up for the free 50 dollar amazon gift card and use that 50 dollars to buy omega through amazon. The plex I got from the packs went into omega'ing my alts. I've been playing for 2 months now and I have a moderately trained Orca pilot and 3 miners. Decimating moon belts while I afk and binge watch netflix (keep semi attention on the bad guys that show up to gank). Making 900 mil every day. Since I got all ships/gear and haven't specialized in anything other than mining yet, I dont need ships nor other stuff. I focus solely on speeding up my prograss. Every day I spend the money I saved on skill injectors. I'm 2 months old but already have the skill training of a person playing for 6 months and I plan to keep going. I've already become self sufficient because I can buy a month of omega for an alt every 2 days. Every day I log on, I feel a weird tinge of excitement? It's the satisfaction of making money. Grant you, 700-900 mil per day is ALOT but its not alot alot. People make 4-5 billion a day easy and have dozens of alts. But I'm well on my way to starting my own empire and the notion of building something that is mine and the pursuit of money is exciting for me.

The universe of EVE online is massive with lots of gameplay depth. I can understand why the people who love it swear by this game. It can truly be beautiful at times, almost like a second life. Where you are a citizen in a vast sci-fi universe filled and fueled by players.

However, the lawlessness (or as the fanboys call it, the ""sandboxiness"") of the in-game systems and mechanics attracts as certain type of player to this game. The type that loves to loot, scam, plunder and destroy. Sometimes just for the sake of it. Honestly, I don't blame them, because playing this game the regular way without a massive time investment (I'm talking years) is extremely boring and unrewarding. 

It's so much more fun and financially rewarding to be a pirate or a con artist. Due in part to the developer's attitude towards keeping this game as organic and open-world as possible. Or maybe they don't even care anymore, I don't know. But essentially, such a playstyle goes unpunished and becomes the norm. The completely broken mechanics of some aspects of the game don't exactly help the situation either.

So if you wan't to play EVE Online as an industrialist and you're just picking up the game... Don't, it's far more profitable for you to steal, con or loot ISK than to try and make it yourself. You might make a few million ISK an hour playing this game as a non-dickwad alpha clone but you could make hundreds of millions or possibly billions of ISK fighting for or stealing it.

You will not see a decent return on investment on your infrastructure and research until a much later point in the game (which I should mention is not possible without an Omega subscription and a time wall which can stretch for several months).

Combat is fairly decent in this game. A large variety of ships and modifications, you can have lots of fun trying out different playstyles and ships. Finding your perfect ship for every situation and optimising every small detail of your ship. Combat itself is nothing hold your breath about, especially in 2018. It's nothing like the trailers make it look.

Overall, it's a solid game which unfortunately encourages juvenile behaviour to get ahead unless you've made a huge investment into the game. This ultimately makes EVE not worth the ocean of headache for the pond of fun.",1533319994,1533319994,False,8,2,0.568323612213134766,0,True,False,False

That was Q4 2016, and I was pissed that they'd switched to a premium/free account system and locked half the game behind a paywall, essentially dangling the carrot in front of new players instead of giving them a taste of the full experience. I felt that this was indicative of some deeper malaise, and that it only spoke of a future in which CCP continued to put content behind DLC or similar real money exchange systems. Well, it's been a couple years, and I've been proven hella wrong. CCP has only continued to update and improve the game, which earns them a huge measure of respect from me. They've just kept pumping the content out despite the game's age, and it's only been made better. There are a couple of things that don't sit well with me, chief among them the ability to purchase skill boosters with real money, but they fall short in the face of the positives. This game is a truly unique experience. It's incredibly grindy, has an absolutely IMMENSE learning curve, and is not new player friendly to the slightest degree. The amount of content to be experienced in this game is insane, and it rivals WoW in terms of scope. It boasts a huge, seamless universe, a deep combat system, a player-driven economy, and much more. There's just no other game like it. Unfortunately, it also takes years of skill training to be able to pilot the largest vessels. Chances are, you'll never get to sit in the pilot seat of a Titan-class ship, no matter how many hours you pump into this game. Even if you had the skills, you'd almost definitely lack the ISK (money). It's just that kind of game. No two players play it the same way, and some things just won't be fun. Mining is fun for some, while others find it mind-numbing. The same goes for trading and ratting. Finding what you enjoy and doing it is key to having fun with EVE. It's often a singular task that keeps players coming back. If you can find your niche, you'll have a good time.

With that, I've gotta recommend this game. It's really fun, especially if you can get into an active corporation. There's so much to do and so many things to explore that there's next to no exhausting this game's content. It's great. Unfortunately, it's not exactly my ideal MMO, and I've moved on to other games. Despite that, I still love this game for what it is and what it stands for. As far as MMOs go, EVE Online gets an 8/10 from me. There are only a few things that keep it from being a perfect score. One of those things is the [i]huge[/i] barrier between new players and veterans. A new player will never, [i]ever[/i] be able to catch up to a vet due to this game's realtime skill system, and that's something I don't like so much. It does create an interesting dynamic in the playerbase, though, so I'll give it that. Aside from that, there are pretty much only personal gripes that have to do with quality of life and personal preference. It's free to play with a few caveats, and if you have fun then it's worth it to dump the cash on some PLEX for an enhanced experience.",1479516465,1532472686,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It is not a new player friendly game. New players are so far behind on skill points (sp) that they can never compete. It is going to take you a good year to get up enough skill points to do the things you want, all the while paying $15 USD a month to keep playing and there is nothing you can do to speed it up (there are implants but we are talking like a few % faster)

Do the the maths that is $1000 USD of Plex i would have to buy, resell in game to buy a charchter to play the the game......A thousand god dam dollars. nope. if CCP ever some hpw give new players a betting start so that are not 8 years behing some of the other players wwith no way to close the gap i might have another, untill than dont waste your time.",1454235826,1531618591,True,0,0,0.491698712110519409,0,True,False,False

It has far too much downtime waiting for things to happen and the game itself is unoptimized despite being almost 2 decades old now. The community aren't helpful, nearly every discussion breaks down into ""STOP DOING THINGS YOUR WAY, MY WAY IS BETTER"" which is confusing to new players. You always feel like you're not getting anywhere because people keep stating the game is only playable if you're turning over millions of ISK per hour to pay for all the PvP deaths, as PvP seems to be the only way anyone has any feasible fun in the game, but in order to make that fun you have to wait and grind out the most boring experiences you'll face in a game. The game has a god awful first impression and it rarely improves. 

The game is rampant with Trolls, Scammers and Gankers which ruin the experience for new players, CCP does bugger all to actually help new players network together to try and learn the game, everything regarding that is done outside of the game via corp portals like EVE University, Actually getting help and the ability to network within the game itself is a total pain in the ass and is inaccessible to the majority of new players. The game is also impossible to enjoy as a solo player. But the process of joining a corp and having to stay to the corps outrageous life destroying demands is equally as bad.

I immensely dislike the gameplay or rather lack there of with EVE Online. There is barely any fun to be had from the game and most commenters always say ""wait a year or two and then make up your mind"" I did this, it sucks.

-	EVE has been around for 15 years by now.
-	That it’s getting quite a lot of media coverage for those big battles with a focus on how much rl money the ships that were destroyed would cost.
-	That it’s not exactly newbie-friendly
-	That it’s a FFA PVP game where many people have turned betrayal into an art.

All that is true. And yes, the game has an insanely steep learning-curve, even with the tutorials. You will definitely need to use the wiki, apply for the Eve UNI guild (which is running the wiki and is teaching people in game), and really… you will need to find a corp, as that is the best way to get info, learn how to play, learn how to fight and survive. 

Still, you WILL die. You will lose stuff, and you might be betrayed. Don’t let it get to you. Don’t consider every ship as “your char” or whatever… think of it like ammunition, as it’s expendable and you will probably lose it. 

EVE is very much about the community, about playing with other players. There now IS a bit of PvE singleplayer-stuff, but it’s not THAT much, and it might not be enough to keep you entertained for long. 

Decide what you want to do (be a miner/industrialist, which still means you should know the basics of fighting and be good at running away, be a corp member involved in a lot of fights, whether it’s big battles or routine patrols in your corps’ system, be an industrialist or even a trade hauler), then figure out what skills you need, what ships to use. 

Find a corp that supports your playstyle, ask for help/advice, be wary and careful… and maybe, the game will grab you and keep you hooked, as it has done for many people for 15 years now. 

Yes, it sometimes looks like some kind of spreadsheet-simulator, and yes, it’s tough to understand all that is involved (fitting ships, fighting, etc), but there are a lot of people willing to help, and many great resources. 

And – the game is free, so check it out! 

TL;DR: EVE has quite a reputation, and it’s still a tough place to be. Yes, you will die and lose stuff… after you spent a lot of time learning how to even play. But it still is one of the most fascinating sandbox-games, and if you find the right corp for you, it still is a ton of fun.",1529930231,1529930270,True,6,0,0.560293138027191162,0,True,False,False

EVE is an entirely different game than what most people are used to. It is grueling, difficult, and challenging to a casual player. However, especially with the ""Into The Abyss"" expansion, there is something to do for everyone. Whether it's mining in an asteroid belt, to playing a major role in the wars that take place in null sec that often time make national headlines, there's hardly ""nothing"" to do. 

There are two types of learning to be done in this game simultaneously: The ever persistent training of skills required to use specific ships, weapon systems, modules, industry, research, etc., and the mechanical skill / game knowledge gained by playing over time. Some people will catch on much quicker than others. There will be players who excel in specific areas of the game, there will be jacks of all trades, and there will be those who are completely clueless. In-game training time is long, but rightfully so. You can't expect someone to immediately learn how to effectively use high tech mining equipment in a manner of hours. It takes days, weeks, or sometimes months. 

This game also offers extremely in-depth analytics of the player run economy, as well as up-to-date market data on some of the most frequently purchased items. Don't be mistaken, you cannot buy in game currency. Every single bit of isk in game was made through money fountains that the game provides (such as killing NPC's, mission running, or the recently introduced Project Discovery, which uses real word data in an entertaining way). Everything in game is built, made, or procured by players. Everything can also be lost to players, as well as NPC's. Death means something. It means you lose all those minerals mined, all the planetary products used, all the time it took to make that ship, and often times that loss can hurt.


This game is sadistic as fuck. It will kick you around and try to drain your wallet and your energy; if you let it, that is.

The community is super helpful and often times help new bros out by explaining simple game mechanics that are initially hard to grasp.

I started this game on a whim with no clue where to begin. I spent the first few months of the game wandering around in various newbie friendly corporations/alliances (EVE's guild equivalent). None of them really had anything going for them then I bought my first Stratios and jumped my first wormhole. I never went back to known space other than to shop.

It was at that point where I started my own corporation with the intent to setup a permanent base of operations. We had around 20 people join up to tour wormhole space with me and it was there where we met our first group of friends a group of German players that we'd eventually share a wormhole with. With our new friendship in place we went around killing off structures and some small gang PvP.

Up until this point I hadn't had any real fun in the game, I was always the one getting killed, which made it difficult to soldier on after losing billions of ISK (the in-game currency) on ships. But my killboard soon ended up with more green than red! This changed my opinion of the game and made me feel all fuzzy on the inside!

A few months of that went on and I had begun to get bored again. I needed something a bit bigger to do, that and my corporations activity suddenly dropped leaving me and three other active players to do content. Which we could do, but time zones are a pain. So I set forth looking for a larger wormhole corporation, and boy, did I find one!

At this point I am still relatively new to EVE even though I had been playing for five or six months so I wasn't even sure that this group would accept my application. I had found them in the corporation finder and decided to drop an application off. This is the point at which I consider that my EVE career took off at. I did my interview with one of the officers and was invited a day or two after.

After that invite the very first thing I did, within that very first week of joining, I helped with hole control while we setup the corporation’s/alliance’s Keepstar. That right there was the most interesting 24 hour period I had in EVE up until this point. It’s not often that a Keepstar goes up in wormhole space; I believe out of all the wormhole corporations only two other corporations have them. A third alliance did have one before my particular group but it was the first and only keepstar in wormhole space to die. For now.

During the keepstar setup period of 24 hours most of it was quiet, until a rival alliance’s CEO jumped into our wormhole and saw what we were trying to accomplish. Then everyone went on high alert. From there we had two large rivals rolling (the act of closing a static wormhole [the wormhole that is always guaranteed to be in your wormhole. It is random, but connects to a certain class of wormhole] and opening a new one) for our wormhole. They actually got into the static wormhole, one lucky scan away and jump away.

I also got my very first Dreadnought kill as a celebratory Doomsday kill we all got to whore on.

Just like before we went on small gang PvP and large gang PvP. Killed some more Dreadnoughts, some twenty-thirty man fleets, mining fleets, stations, and then we got onto our large eviction of another big wormhole corporation. 

You’ll hear that EVE takes awhile to get anything done. During this eviction that lasted the better part of a month, the initial attacks threw to the end of clean up/loot collection, took three weeks. Yes it was a boring three weeks after the initial attack and timers. The enemy didn’t want to feed us kills so they sat in their stations until the final timer in which they had to fight. They did lose, but damn it as a good fight!

In the end, it’s really about the adventure that EVE gives you that makes it memorable. Not the game play which yes it can be tedious, but if you work at it the game can be quite fun.

My most memorable moment in Eve Online.

I had been playing eve for a month, I refered my self to create and alt.

I got my Isk For redeemeing, and as I learned to Pvp The wallet sank as each day passed.

One Day I met xxCEOxx , He offered me a well paid job if I joined his corporation

I was broke, I needed something,

 He invites me to teamspeak

I find out he Also is from the UK, We spoke for hours, as I worked for him

What did I do for him? He bought me a Badger mk 2, A cheap Hauling ship

The ships cargo is pretty good for a hauler, So I hauled his Player Owned Station (POS) 
modules and supplies to help him set up his POS.

I felt wanted, I felt I had a purpous, Soon we will have our own POS, he explains in details the benefits.

I am jumping throught dangerous space without knowing, Inexperienced, and  No fear, as I had NO CLUE what low security was and how it even all worked.

I travel through low sec to the designated check point to meet the Boss, He Uncloaks and warps us to a worm hole , I  Stare at this scairy pulsating bubble of darkness.

""WTF IS THIS"" I asked

""Right click > Enter worm hole"" he said

We made it safe, The POS was set up, After speaking for hours he listened to my story 

""What Do you want Eve online""? I had tried mining, and PVPing with harsh SP amount.

""I want to learn to PVP without worring about ISK"" I Said

He Asked me what battleships I can fly, He bought me a Nightmare, a Faction Battleship, and Fitted it for me.
He invited me to fleet
I join the fleet, 12 other people
He asked me to join a different Teamspeak
Got a Big welcome.


""Everyone this is Mr Welsh, Hes new to Eve, He wants to make ISK with us, so if any of you have GIFTS to welcome him to the ISN Community, please go ahead now.

I got 1.5 Billion ISK, How many Hurricanes and Drakes can I buy for that? I thought

I ran incursions with xxCEOxx for months and months, and built up a nice fat wallet of ISK.

I went on to play with 3 accounts, to help me get out of difficult pvp spots.

I bought expensive ships, implants, modules, characters

All.....

Because...

I met xxCEOxx and he changed my Eve Life,

I understand completely game is a dog eat me game. but that is also why I left it.

Really not a game where a solo or a few peeps can play any length of time and enjoy. Need band togather with dozens to hundreds of others... and I am not a social player so I am odd man out.
With the time commitment needed..getting shit ganked ..well just sucked.
Players rarely play as if real..unless they ALL play as if killing everyone and laughing is what our future holds.

I would be back in heartbeat if was in term of game Carebear was more prevalent. More PvE..More tied together story..more missions {not same over and over and over} ..more zones, areas, belts, where those who don't care for gankers can play.

Where do I begin?

1. ""Players are toxic""

Yes. Aren't people like that in real-life already? Also, it's common sense. You venture to a low-security system, or null-security system, what do you expect people to do? Hold your hands and sing kumbaya?
Join a corp and start communicating. Corp is not responsive? Leave corp and find another one.

2. ""Boo-hoo, my frigate can't kill [insert big ship here]""

One of the greatest misconceptions of Eve. Bigger doesn't mean better. A titan can't kill a frigate orbiting at 500m at 1v1, be it with a 10-year old character, and a 1-day frigate newb. If you know the mechanics of the game, play around those.

3. ""My ship is destroyed, boo-hoo""

Why did you play Eve in the first place?

4. ""I don't want to pvp, just pve! Why am I still getting rekt?""

Low-sec, Null-sec. Ring a bell? If you're in hi-sec, are you carrying plex or skill injectors by any chance? If you are, I'd gank you 900% of the time. Ask yourself why you're destroyed. Are you carrying something valuable?

5. ""It's work! hurr-durr, I can't work for a monthly subscription""

You don't need it. The sub is just an icing on top. Don't aim on earning for subscription time. Just play. Join a corp. Talk about life on Teamspeak while mining a belt, those are some of the best times in my entire Eve life.


--
I've been playing Eve on and off, I used to be that player who always gets his ship rek'd, or not knowing what to do. Make an effort to learn the ropes. Be patient. It's all worth-it in the end once you find your niche of 'fun'. For me, it's mining on ice belts and chatting away my real-life problems on Eve. No other game offers that but Eve.

I returend to the game a couple of times and watched it grow and it was very interested for me to see how much depth and complexity they constantly added, but what other reviewers were saying, large corporations dictate and manipulate things to a significant scale, there is a lot of lying and cheating, as developers officially say that you can use your real life ""abilities"" (which includes being a sleazy deceitful slime) to gain advantage over your enemies. There are also a lot of people who will just gank you and kill you for fun if you are a rookie, and I remember a friend that I went the primary school with, who was very very experienced player who just started laughing when I mentioned EVE to him, and he sad there are so many frauds in the game, even the game moderators made different deals with players who sell digital assets for real cash to players and then they all together split the money. Basically the emotions he shown were all saying, the game is not worth mentioning how many things work in wrong ways.

If you see the ratings of 60% on a game that lasts for 15 years and develops and didn't stagnate with updates, then it should be clear that they have made a lot of serious an very unappelaing mistakes on thier way. Usually teams who make games create complex systems that are not easy for them to change, even some bugs can be very difficult to fix, and even more common trait is the arrogant and defensive stance which clearly says we are not going to seriously deal with anything since it is either too hard for us to do or we just don't want to, or on the other hand they promise big changes which they fail to deliver, but from my perspective, EVE online has a lot of great things implemented and complexity is one of them, but there are also a lot of very seiorus issues that their team should really invest time and effort to actually fix. By all that I have written it should be obvious that their devs and support team doesn't actually take care about their player base, and I can't say I was much satisfied when I talked to them in the past, as they mostly let things roll on thier own but not in good ways.

I do hope they manage to get some lessons from the vast variety of mistakes they have made so far and exploits they have carelesly allowed, and implement a dose of fairness in the future though.

It could become cold, austere and sometimes boring. But if you have patience and will, you will become anything you want which spaceship pilot could be. None of the other MMO's offering such realistic experience of 'living' in their virtual dimension as Eve Online do.

The galaxy is a living, breathing thing and every action has somekind of consequence, tiny or small. Someone killing a miner somewhere will affect someones ability to make items: It may not be a huge impact, but it still is there.

I've been playing this game since 2010, I take occasional break but I always come back. It's one of my favorite games of all time, just because I feel very much home in it. Sure there are annoying butthole people around, but what game doesn't have those? Besides most of my interactions with other players have been very pleasant. (If you get killed, try asking advice from the guy who killed you: Most of the time they'll reply and help you out, may even give you some money! We love newbros <3 Ofc there will be some dicks too, but just ignore them and move on.)

Most people recommend new players to join a corporation or big alliance. I agree to a degree, it's a good way to get your feet wet and see how things work. I tried that too and had some good times, but I always felt a bit like ""cog in the wheel"" and it wasn't that fun to me after some time, so I joined a smaller corporation and I have fun playing now.

So I also wanna mention for people like me, who are more introverted and just wanna do some space things alone in big space game: It's possible. You don't have to join that big alliance everyone asks you to join, you don't have to stay in hi-sec and mine forever, you can do anything you wish. What I like to do in this game is solo pvp: I like roaming through dangerous areas of space, then shooting anything that moves. Most of the time I die, but there are times I win the fight. When I won my first 1v2 fight, I was so happy, and it made me crave more. I also wanna mention my friend who just likes to mine and is very content doing that. Do what you want! Just remember, since it's a sandbox, every playstyle is valid: You mining 24/7 and the guys who gank miners 24/7. Nobody is ""entitled"" to be safe in their playstyle or whatever.

But whatever you do, you should join atleast some (good, friendly) corporation. The game will get dull if you don't have nobody to chat with or ask advice from. But be warned, making a corporation yourself is tough business, it requires time and patience and knowledge. If you just wanna play with your friends, make a private chat for your group and fleet up. You don't need a corporation for that.

TL;DR: Good community, spaceships are cool, it's sandbox so every way to play is valid (solo or group). Do what you enjoy doing, not just what others tell you is enjoyable to do! Find your own space thing and do it!

But, honestly most of my actions in-game have been to just update the skill queue on a character i started ages ago. There's so many stories about this game and how grand scale everything is, but from the perspective of a brand new player, there's no fast starts unless you shell out the cash, and once one of your characters gets decently skilled up, it feels like its just a waiting game till you hit the skill ceiling (not being omega), a waiting game because why start any other characters. You can't train them without stopping training on your main, so you can't complete at least one of the initial quests or take them into playing. Maybe this is addressed with clones, but not being omega, i can't see that. So right now my whole play experience has been log on every 48 hours, udate the skill queue, wonder if i should risk it by doing some mining, then logging off -> and from that perspective, i'm not really willing to shell out $10-$15 a month.

Searching around for advice on starting in Eve is largely join a corp immediately. But a lot of the corps ask for long term, consistent log in, time commitments.. like i just started playing again 5 mins ago and you want me to agree to 3 months logging in daily at blah blah time for 2 hours to do mining.... sure mate, let me just update my calender... alt-f4 is the shortcut on windows right.... 

Honestly, i haven't played too much of it in all and maybe when i get close to the skill cap without omega on my main i'll switch to a new character that i can just mess about and relearn the game systems with.

training goes really slow so it will take you atleast 4 to 7 days before you can fly an destroyer class ship.
will take you even longer to get to the cruisers. and so forth.
some training  skills can take entire weeks even months to complete.
that is where skill injectors come in, buy them for real money, and you can train much faster.

Spending hours upon hours on mining, nonstop to earn enough ingame money, to buy enough plex so you can get to be gold member.  if that is your fancy this game is for you.

CCP simply does not care about botting in EVE, because it increases the price of PLEXes, and thus devalues ISK gained through legitimate gameplay. Then, the people addicted to microtransactions will pour thousands in to PLEXes to sell them off for ISK that they need.

For CCP to fix botting, they'd also need to re-do a lot of the game because it is so easy to automate. Instead of doing that, they'd rather just expose the entire game with APIs that have no reason to exist other than to make automation easier.

Get caught? Don't worry, you get multiple 'chances' before you get banned. Get publically shamed on the forums for operating a massive bot ring for years without any consequence? Don't worry, you'll continue to operate for years since you're profit for CCP.

If only CCP would release some way for my bots to play entirely command line, that would be great, because then instead of running a ton of VMs I could just run 40-50 consoles on my PC while I sleep.

One advice for new players: Just make sure to get your complimentary copy of Sanderling (available on GitHub) ready before launching so you're primed and ready to ruin the game's economy. It's not detected, because CCP does not care at all if you're directly manipulating the game client in any way you see fit.

CCP Guard did a great job responding to this review. Go ahead and read up on the EVE subreddit for the opinion of veteran players about whether or not what he says is true. If you don't want to bother, the answer is they expect CCP is lying about taking action against bots and don't care about the integrity of their game.",1519107248,1519153162,False,157,16,0.755926012992858887,35,True,False,False

Many titles take on the genre of ""Sand-box"" but this is one of the few games that live up to it. The platform is set by the developers, and they focus on development through balance. Everything else is up to the player-base to create that content. You are the content, quite literally. The game is one of the best as far as social community goes, and your freedom to choose your playstyle is not limited by a linear meta, or by developer made rules. Pick one of four races, but have the ability to train any line of ships from any race over time. You are a capsuleer seeking purpose in a massive single-server adventure that is played in real time (Training is in real time as well). After you get the hang of things, you can even pay for your subscription with in game money (Isk) rather than real money. Titles such as World of Warcraft (WoW) have only recently followed suit with this sucessful idea, and we're close to the death of subscription games. I've gotten to do a little bit of everything in this game, but I personally enjoy destroying other player's ships, and the thrill involved with the permenant loss of assets every time you choose to attack or travel. 

This is not a game for everyone. It's not a fast paced arcade simulator. You training will take years (Literally) but at least the training continues even while you're offline as long as you are subscribed. This doesn't mean you can't play right away, but you won't be able to use advanced ships right off the bat (and honestly, with the right piloting size does not matter, and money doesn't solve everything, especially not in eve) The new player experience has improved IMMENSELY since I was a new player, and is much easier to adapt to things today. The game will guide you through different paths, showing you the basics of most major playstyles, and it's up to you what you do from there. 

PROS
Immense community
Helpful Alliances and corporations for new players
Complex player-based Market
Player-created empires and owned space
Choice of playstyle (Combat, exploration, Miner, Production, Marketeering, etc)
Smooth gameplay
Dedicated developers 
Your targets are never safe.

CONS
Steep learning curve
Learning the player based meta, and who to trust (or don't) takes time.
Lengthy training times to get into advanced ships.
Suggested two monitors to avoid menu clutter
When exceeding 4000 players in one area, can be laggy
Sometimes misguided Develpment.
You are never safe.

After you completed the initial starter event and missions you are let loose on the vast universe that is New Eden.  This can be a daunting task however and many of players with 100s of hours have rage quit over a lost ship or a heist.  This game does not take days or weeks to progress like other MMO’s, it takes months and years depending on your goals.  It is long in the tooth but the payoff is worth it.  
    
    There are unlimited ways to play Eve Online but some of the traditional paths one can take could be, exploring (scanning down data, relic or combat sites to complete for the dank loot), mine (become a gather of New Eden, albeit slow and some say boring but it can pay the bills), mission running (running missions from NPC for rewards and reputation), faction warfare (fight opposing factions in PvP for rewards and honor), Industry (build the modules, ships and citadels of New Eden, for most everything in game is created by the players), Marketeer (buy low and sale high, find the lowest prices for goods and transport them to trade hubs for profits).
    
    Once you get established and you have a way to make “isk”, Eve Online’s currency, you can then start to look outside of the highsec areas and find your way in to nullsec or wormhole space or maybe you’ve found your niche in highec and that is fine.  However for me, Eve Online comes alive when you step out the nest and join a corporation.  You will form bonds that go beyond the game world, you will meet people from all over the world, you will always be learning something new.  All you have to do is stick with it.  I am not even getting in the geopolitics of New Eden where massive collalitions of players fight over galaxy’s for space to earn income and build their empires.  
   
    If you can stick with it, this game will give you an experience no other game can.  Don’t fly what you can’t afford to lose and always fly dangerously.  Someone can destroy your ship but not your spirit.",1518935782,1518936163,True,22,3,0.637209475040435791,0,True,False,False

I played since 2007, and all in all, invested tons of time, and money into this game. I even biomassed my 10 year old character, and now play with the same character name as an Alpha account, staying in a schooling corporation.

Do I give it a thumbs up? [b]Yes I do.[/b] Why? Because its a fun space game that keeps on changing.

But do note, that piracy, is [b]rampant.[/b] If you are a casual player, who just wants to meddle in the asteroid fields while watching your favorite TV show, go for it. However, theres many things that the tutorial doesn't tell you. The community as a whole in this game, at least in High Security space, is very toxic. There are, however many good groups out in Nullsec who will take in new players and train them into the fun aspects of PvP, regardless of your skills. [b]Karmafleet[/b] is one of the largest groups. Yes, I'm a Goonswarm shill.

But if you do plan to remain in ""High Security"" space, do note that its not very secure if you think you'll never have any kind of PvP interactions. PvP in High Security space is more like involuentary PvP. Heres a couple examples that do ruin the new player experience, and a few tips to help so you don't come into this game, just to turn around and quit because something happened that shouldn't have.

[b]Ganking:[/b]

If a hostile player finds that the value of your ship and cargo is worth more than the ship they're using to destroy your vessel in a split second before the CONCORD police shows up and acts, they will. This means, you could mine for a few hours, fill a hauler full of your earned ores and minerals, and try to transport it back to a trade hub like Jita, only to be destroyed by someone in a cheaply fitted Destroyer, will ruin any new players day.

[u]Tip from a bittervet:[/u] Train the Medium Shield Extender and fit them on all your hauling vessels, this will help prevent ganking. 

[b]War Declarations:[/b]

There are many groups, such as the Marmite Collective, who will just declare war on any corporation they see. I don't know why, maybe they're trying to set some kind of record, but if you decide to start your own player-owned corporation, or join one, odds are, you'll be up against groups like these.

Its a very poor mechanic that the victim has no say when war is declared on another corporation. It should be possible to reject the declaration in some way.

[u]Tip from a bittervet:[/u] Stay in your schooling corporation until you're ready to leave high security space. Its actually more fun in Low and Null security space for any kind of PvP, than to try to go up against professional gatecampers.

[b]Can Flippers[/b]

These are players who will deposit a jettison container in space with something in it, maybe a PLEX or something, to get you to take the item inside, which would be considered stealing since it is owned by the player who deployed the container. Once you take the item, they have free will to destroy your ship.

[u]Tip from a bittervet:[/u] Your safety switch should be green, if you're not prepared to attack a hostile baiter who will have friends to support them, avoid these types of people.

[b]Scammers[/b]

These are people who like to make contract offers and spam them in chat channels throughout New Eden. Typically they're pretty easy to spot. Others try to make contract games, which usually were already accepted by a friend or alt to get you to fall for their scam posts later on. There are hundreds of scams, and more every day.

[u]Tip from a bittervet:[/u] Read every contract and price carefully, odds are, if its too good to be true, it probably is. The only real deals you'll find, are people who are in Low or Null security space, who are moving and want to liquedate their assets, and typically will sell things way below market value. But rarely will you find such things in High Security Space.

But all in all, if you keep those things in mind, you, the new player, should have no problems enjoying all that EvE has to offer. There are so many things beyond even what the Tutorials say you can do.",1518909585,1518909585,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DO NOT under any circumstances buy it through steam though.  it will only make your life a nightmare.

Edit/Update Feb 2018:  Much of the crossover issues have been fixed so its better to buy on steam now than ever but before doing so I would look around for what is called the ""EVE premium pack"" which is sold by other online vendors, that is the best way to spend your intial $15 - $30.

Alliances on both sides of this conflict are currently recruiting a lot of new players into their ranks, so if you ever wanted to try EVE Online out; Now might be the best time to do so.

The game is now free to play, but I would still suggest using a buddie invite link. It will give you 250.000 skillpoints upon account creation, which is a good few days worth of skill training and can be pretty useful for anyone who wants to get into the game :)

EVE Online is a very time consuming game but it can be very rewarding as well, depending on what you do with your time in-game. It has been said many times before but still rings true: The game is only as boring as you make it. It's a sandbox game and therefore very open-ended, it doesn't hold your hand after you're done with the tutorial.

I'd recommend you head over and do the career agents after the tutorial. It'll give you free ships, skillbooks and items to get you started. It also provides you with a small taste of the things you can do in-game like; Mining, industry, Missions and exploration. 

For a new player I'd recommend doing exploration to get ISK. It is very profitable in low sec. and null sec. and definetly better than mining. I would also recommend you to find a corporation (Guild) that is 'newbro' friendly. Playing EVE solo is possible, but more likely to burn you out before you get into the game, joining a corp. that has a like-minded playstyle will increase your enjoyment and let you learn from more experienced players at the same time.

One last thing: You are never truly safe in this game unless you are docked. You can be killed at any time, anywhere. I'm not trying to scare you away from the game, chances are you won't be ganked until you are several months into the game. I just want you to understand that you should NEVER fly anything you can not afford to lose. It should be obvious, but some people still do and then complain about it, don't be that guy. 

If you didn't know it already, you lose your ship and everything on it once you get killed. That includes cargo as well, so don't move anything extremely expensive.

EVE Online is a game that requires time to learn and patience to master, hope to see you in-game! o7

I got a day job, it pays me money to waste my time. EVE takes my money AND my time.

And not to mention how all the things that might have been fun in the game are made horrible on purpose. You can outfit your ship in any way you want, but all the modules are so small on your ship you can't even see them. You can mine resources from planets, but if you want the good stuff you have to go into nulsec where you'll get blown to bits even if you don't enjoy the destructive aspects of the game. You can do manufacturing of resources, but you have to babysit each factory and log on every 24 hours of real time to keep them efficient. Got a life and can't log on? Your problem.

The social aspect of this multiplayer game? If you don't know at least 5 other players IRL, you're screwed and that's the end of it.

If you are going to play the game, stick to the FTP  (free to play) version...until CCP starts discouraging online mugging.

Longer (trying not to be biased) version:
The good:  EVE Online is a good MMO game, visually engaging with some interesting game mechanics.  It is also a fairly 'mature' product - and I use that word to mean 'mostly free of bugs'.  It has been out for about 14 years after all.  A rich and varied economy with many different jobs that can be done.  Kudos for this.  Also, the game engine never crashed and dumped me out onto the desktop.

The bad:  'Mostly' free of bugs does not mean free of bugs.  Also, expect a steep learning curve here, with LOTS of stuff to try to remember.  To be fair, they have a number of tutorials - but still...the onus is on you to have to memorize it all.

The ugly:  This one is hard to write.  I experiencd first-hand one glaring example of online bullying and extortion...which as far as I can tell...the people who run the game (CCP) ARE OKAY WITH.  
Yes, yelling there - sorry.  And it will require the explanation of a few terms from the game.
  
There has (supposedly) an NPC 'police presence' in the form of something called the CONCORD.  
Every system you are in  has a number ranging from 1.0 to 0.0:  with 0.5 up to 1.0 being considered 'Hi-sec' or high security; 0.00 being 'No-sec' or no security (aka good luck, you're on your own); the middle ground being 'Low-sec' or low security.
One of the activities in the game is to outfit your ship with one or more mining tools, visit an asteroid belt and extract various materials which you can then sell for ISK (the ingame currency).
Mining is a fairly boring and time consuming activity (keep a book handy), so I was not ready for what happened.

While mining in 'Hi-sec' space (0.5 is still considered hi-sec)  I was: 
  1) Attacked by another player who proceeded to destroy my ship, and loot it.  Apparently without any consequences to them. (Wait, isn't this -supposed- to be HiSec space? Where is the CONCORD when you need them?)
  2) After they blew up my ship, they deliberately targeted my escape capsule and murdered me.
  3) Sent me an email claiming that it was my own fault for 'illgeally mining' and that if I didn't want it to happen again, to 
      pay them 10 million ISK to mine in HiSec territory.  Wait...what?

After I had been butchered, the game sends me an 'after action report'.  The thug who ended me (who apparently had only been playing 19 days) had already garnered a bounty of over 14 billion ISK.  So, this was by no means an isolated incident.  There is evidently a group of these assasins running around.  Wish I had known about this before I had started playing.  It might not have prevented me from trying the game - but I certainly would have altered my approach to playing it.

In the meantime, I am still debating whether or not to abandon this game.  In other words, vote with my feet and just not play this game based this incident.  
I play games online to escape greed and brutality - so having it follow me into the gaming world in unacceptable.
Fortunately, after 135 hours of game-play, I am not that invested in continuing.

I have some suspicions as to the nature of the perpetrators and why the developers would tolerate or possibly even encourage such online larceny - but not going to air that particular speculation in a public forum.

PS  Seeing as the developers are loathe to police their own game, I am hoping that a number of advanced players will take up the hobby of hunting these 'persons' down and hoisting them on their own pitards.

Its playerbase predominantly consists of long term players who I found to be extremely newbie friendly and supportive in many ways. This is a game that is less user friendly than any game I have ever played, and has a much steeper learning curve, so that support that the long term players provide is essential.

The game revolves around the skill point system, which consists of accumulating points over time as long as you continue to pay the subscription fee. They continue to build regardless of your online status, which is nice. Its a definite pro, but its offset by the fact that any player who has subscribed longer than you will always be better in terms of those skill points. These skill points are spent on gathering evermore skills, which in turn open better ship types, weapons, and defensive options to you. Ships, weapons, and defences (sheilds, armor, etc) all cost alot of money (ISK), and so you spend most of your time trying to acquire more and more ISK so you can buy fitted ships to use in Player vs. Player combat. In fact, losing ships is more fun than actually acquiring them in this game.

That brings me to the pvp. Player combat in this game is very different from any other pvp game. Losing a fight means losing millions of ISK in ships. Since acquring ISK is difficult and time consuming, you actually feel like you have lost a lot more than just a ship. You lose time. Given this fact, every battle you engage in has that ""oh crap!"" factor. The, ""I cant afford to lose this ship!"" element that puts you on the edge of your seat in every battle. Since there is no ""safe"" areas in EVE, every time you undock your ship, you potentially enter a battlefield. Its both exciting and terrifying at once.

I will close by saying that this ~IS~ the best pvp game I have played, and I have played in nearly all of them - both space and fantasy based. So, if you crave pvp combat of a gut wrenching nature, this game was made just for you. If you prefer the option of fighting battles when you feel you are ready, then may not be the best place for you to spend your time and subscription money.",1513463767,1513463767,True,3,0,0.515883445739746094,0,True,False,False

- The community is nice enough, but scams are EVERYWHERE. Use caution when dealing with anyone on here, even the guy you've known for a year.
- **This game takes time, and lots of it. Even simple or mundane play styles can require an hour+ to accomplish anything at times. If you don't have the time to sink into a deep gaming experience, EVE might not be a good fit for you.

Conclussion (TL;DR):
EVE Online is a fun game. It's a very detailed game, and is multi faceted. It takes up a lot of time to play though, and might not be a good fit for someone who is pressed for time. It's free to play, but you'll have a much better experience if you shell out $15 for a monthly subscription. All in all, it's worth trying out. Once you've played the tutorial and the first few optional missions, you should have a pretty good idea if EVE is for you or not.",1512844771,1512844900,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like much of the depth of the game system, though I find the business side of EVE to be hard to grasp, probably due to not really knuckling down and putting in the time to analyze markets across the galaxies. Game mechanics can be very interesting. For example, the different damage types and the way fitting platforms affects both damage output and defensive tanking. Also the mining and construction aspects have been pretty solid through the years even with the changes that have been made over time to the mining platforms.

My overall beef is with the human interaction that is stilted. EVE rewards players that are otherwise creepy and terrible people within the game. I don't mean to say you can't find decent and fun people in the game. Rather, the terrible people are empowered by the game's rules. No matter how horrible you act, how many murders you commit, how much you steal and pillage, there are few if any penalties.

Some folks will say that's the attraction to EVE. Well, that proves my point. Much of the base community of the game love it for the evil they can do within it. If that's your thing, then go for it. For a normal person like myself that enjoys friendship, constructive accomplishments, and generally the good guys winning, EVE is quite often a depressing place. As I said before, not just because there are people acting bad, but because the rules favor those that act badly. Acting in a good or honorable manner gets little reward. Acting badly gets you places in the game. Lying, cheating, stealing, backstabbing is where the rubber meets the road. Generally, that's not my cup of tea. Doesn't mean I can't make a little space in this world. It means that, much of the time, I find the real world and my real life career to be more relaxing and rewarding than this devil's den of human dregs that is the community of EVE.",1512502012,1512502012,False,367,41,0.869566500186920166,63,True,False,False

1. DO NOT BE A HIGH SEC MINER. If you already are, I respect you but how the hell can you do it? It is the least interactive experience in the whole game and the only true interaction you get with other players is when a ganker decides to destroy your little mining barge and feast on your newbie tears.

2. Find some friends! Whether you join a small industry group in high sec (DON'T), join low sec pirates looking to prey on idiots, or join one of the big power blocs in nullsec, FIND PEOPLE. Eve is no fun solo. You will burn out very quickly and hate the game as a result, I can almost certainly guarantee it.

3. Unless they are blue, they will screw you. This circles up to point 2, but its still something that is very important to realize. People want to screw you in various different ways, whether it is to take your hard earned isk, steal loot off your dead ship or just the tears they get from you. SO FIND SOME FRIENDS!

Right, those are the most important tips I think newbies need to here. Now, what will you most likely not do in Eve Online?

-You won't lead a multi-thousand nullsec alliance, unless you want another job. Seriously, it's hard, not to mention actually getting players to follow you is like herding cats.
-You will not fly a Titan. They fucking suck to fly most of the time, take literal years to train into, and are only called for the most important operations if you are a part of a nullsec alliance. Just don't.
-You will likely not instrument some grand scheme to take over/steal from a major power. These can take many years to come to fruition, and people are getting better than ever at finding spies.

""Jee, if I can't do all that, what can I do?"" 

-You will meet some great people in this game. Seriously. Despite what you hear, Eve Online needs new players. Nullsec alliances in particular love newer players since they can build loyalty in a young, fresh recruit much better than in an old veteran who has hopped from alliance to alliance. People will be willing to help, just gotta ask around.
-You will have great stories. Eve is the only game I've ever been able to talk to my family about, specifically the people I've met and what I've done. Whether it was being part of some multi-thousand man battle, or just chilling in Teamspeak shooting the breeze with my CEO, its been a blast.

So, the best way to describe Eve is a game of experiences. Is it the best MMO ever? Probably not. Is it the best Sci-Fi game? IMO, not even close. Does any other game come even close to the experiences it can provide? No one's in the same ballpark. So, yes. Play it for a while.

It's more of a hobby of sorts where you spend a couple hours doing wormhole relic sites or ratting in -1.0 sec systems to gather ISK then spend it on PvP ships and go out and blow up other nerds. And to have fun. Joining a corp other than the NPC corps is also a good idea. You can either join a massive null-bloc coalition like Brave, Goons, PL, etc or a smaller one that does say faction warfare, small-gang PvP, etc such as Straya. and Redemption Road.

My one word of advise to anyone who is just starting with a 2+ week trial; go join a corporation that has a well made and reputable newbro program, such as Brave Newbies, Pandemic Horde, Eve Uni, etc. They will most certainly and 100 percently get you started at Eve and get you into the good fights as soon as they can even though your character is new. Sure, you'll likely die a lot but that's all part of the learninig experience. And if you did decide to join one of these newbro friendly alliances/corps, they have a thing called Ship Replacement Program (SRP) so it doesn't really matter if you lose your little tackle or EWAR frigate, they'll just give you a new one. When you're first starting up, that little 1 million ISK frigate of yours is the most expensive thing you've ever owned in the game. But for some of us, that's a single module on one of our ships. And so many people are happy to throw money at newbros simply because they can. 

EVE doesn't necessarily need a huge commitment to play it, but the more you're involved with it, the more fun you can have. And most importantly of all, we should all remember three things: 
1) The best ship in the game is the Friend Ship
2) Never fly what you can't afford to lose.
3) F*** CODE.

to lay out this review. i had tried EVE multiple times via trial accounts in the past, but for some reason could not brake the barrier to find myself playing the game long term. i always wanted things delivered to me short and sweat, until 2011 when i was pulled back in, and this time with a plan, i mined and did industry jobs purely for 9 months. untill i gave up again. due to not being satisified with what i was doing. was making okey ISK. but taking time to train for combat ships, i just couldnt deal with it at the time and gave up.

now come the release of alpha clone states last year in which the game was going free to play, ive stuck with the game longer than i ever had. which. PvP for me. was the one true calling to continue being interested in the game.

*Also Cause i bought a starter pack in previous summer sales and decided to hop in* :P ""Shhh dont tell anyone""

the game requires extreme patiences and a clear plan in what you want to do. you have to realize you cant get everywhere or do everything simply from the get go. the game requires ALOT commitment and time to get really started. but granted its a commitment that not everyone may be able to fufill.

but by all means if you find a good corp/alliances you will have tons of fun from those experiences. the only hard part about the game is finding a continued and sustainable way to make ISK (In game currency). especially for alphas that wish to continue plexing every month. as it stands right now 500 plex (1 month game time) goes roughly for 1.6 - 1.8 billion ISK

if you partake in PvP frequently and factor in all your expenses. depending on what youre doing and how often you are doing it. alphas wont get omega status at least 2 months in depending on activity time.

Ratting (Killing NPC's), Exploration, Incursions, Industry, PvP'ing etc etc will net you a varying amount of ISK income per hour, which it could be consistant or extremely random. exploration and pvp being the most random. 

EVE is fantastic to play but requires patiences and alot of learning on your side in order to truly figure out what you would like to do. when you're first in the game and get past the tutorial. Please....PLEASE join a corp or alliance that accepts newbro's (newbies) 

there is alot of people that can offer advice from experience on what you could be doing to better improve yourself and currenct activity's",1511385426,1511385426,True,3,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

But it tries, and if you put the time in, you'll find that it comes fairly close.

I have played a lot, a LOT, of Eve. I first subscribed in 2008 after having heard the same stories that you have if you're sitting here trying to decide whether or not to install it. And even having played it for nine goddamn years, I learn new things pretty regularly. This is not a simple game. It's complex in infuriating ways. Until you get the hang of it, the UI is going to get in the way. Although CCP has attempted to improve the new player experience, the underlaying mechanics of how anything works are often frustratingly arcane or counterintuitive. All the cool ships are locked away behind months of skill training. The fucking scrollwheel zoom is backwards. 

But Eve sucks you in. Yeah, the community is smaller than WoW, for instance, but they're active and they're passionate. You'll make friends and enemies. There are people sitting on my standings list that I've had a grudge against for years, and it works because that's the time scale that you start to think on when you're playing Eve.

I guess there are free-to-play accounts now, and if you want to give Eve a shot it'll be no skin off your nose. But if you do, and I hope you do, take my advice and be social. This isn't a game to play alone.",1511341399,1511341399,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-Play PvE alone.
-Join a player corporation as a mining drone.

THAT'S IT!

There's a very interesting system of risk versus reward here. See, if you're in a solar system with security above 0.5, police forces will eventualy come to help you if somebody attacks you. It doesn't mean you will survive, just that the offender will get killed! But that is enough deterrent for most people not to shoot you in high sec. BUT the police does nothing if your corporation or alliance (which is a group with several corporations) is at war with the offender's corp (or alliance). Stuff you can get in those high sec systems is far less valuable than the one you can find on low or null sec. You take the risk and may get a far bigger reward and make up for any loses, which is OK.

What is not OK is that pirate groups declare war on EVERYBODY, on ALL the alliances and corporations they can find, so they can shoot them ANYWHERE without repercussions. They literally camp outside trade hubs 24/7 and shoot anything they can. All that elaborate security system, to the trash. All the guys who try to follow a PvE career have alts on NPC corps (like haulers, for example), so they can't get shoot that easily. Is moronic, really.
Also, if you kill an NPC, somebody steals the content and you shoot him... guess what? No police is going to help you! So, outside trade hubs, there are always guys marked as ""suspect"" (which happens when you steal something), waiting for people to shoot at them so they can blow you up.

So, you play alone (where you are in an NPC corporation and no war can be declared to you) or join a null security corp and go to a far place where you shoot anybody that is not in your corp and alliance and forget about PvE missions (Because, once in null space, it's VERY HARD to get to high sec going through other corps space). And, if you join a null corp... guess what is the first task you have to do for them? That's right, mining. You usually can sell the minerals to corporation itself, which use it or sell it at a HIGHER price (twice or more). You have become a mining drone. Congrats! I've met guys who doesn't even know how the game is outside null. They've played months and months, never doing missions or looking at a trade hub in their lives.

The designers want people to get together and make friends, so people can stay in the game. And then say: ""Guys, go out there and loose a couple of ships! You will see it's not that terrible!"". Of course, I guess for an old player, with a steady income, that can get very valuable stuff from null sec, with millions of points on skills, which does have a fair chance to stay alive after an encounter, it's not a big deal. For a new player, trying to sell the minerals it took him HOURS to get in high sec and being shot outside of a trading hub, just because he committed the sin of joining a corporation at war... it's bad. Very, very bad.

Those design inconsistencies between what they want and how they're (not) achieving it, are just awful. I guess they don't understand new players. Or PvE.

There is much to be said about any game that allows you freedom to play your way, even to the point of not engaging in combat, ever. You can play EVE Online completely pacifist and still have fun, if planning, research, and mining are in your interests.
The learning curve is very steep, though, and it can get very boring drifting through space alone if you're not in a guild or have no friends to play with you.

  My name is Ignacio Daimon, I have flown in Eve for 4 years now. Thousands of hours, countless months spent studying and learning how to truly understand this game. It is not for the feint of heart, It is not for the casual. It will feel like a job, Like a lot of games do. However with dedication, time, and persistance you can do things such as I have like, become one of the worlds best solo pvp pilots (Once upon a time), Write articles that thousands read and learn from the experience you have gained. Take down 500+ person alliances as a spy, Steal money, Lie, Cheat, Anything to get ahead. 

  PVP is the lifeblood of Eve, If you played and quit, you likely never got in a ship and went to blow up another. Its a rush, there's nothing like it. All your 'gear' on your ship if you will, on the line to be destroyed forever. Solo PVP is an amazing rush of skill and timing, where it goes from good to gone in around 60seconds. Small gang pvp, get a group with ships to cover all beneficial mods and go take on something large, Long range or short, take your fancy. Fleet PVP , this is where things get serious. Hundreds of people locked in a system for 1,2,3-10 hours of battle, risking $100,000+ more at times on the field. 

  Sure you can settle for a less then perfect game, we all can. Eve is no different. However it offers a unique atmosphere where people attach real life value to the ships and structures they own. Where everything you do is built on an empire of trust.  You have options from Faction grinding, Fleet Incursions (Raids for lack of a better word, Very trusted/skilled public groups). PVE content from level 1-5 where you can make millions, to billions depending on what you are willing to risk. 

  You can mine ore, You can mine moons, You can hunt ships that cost Hundreds if not a thousand dollars in real world value. Dive into wormholes, Hunt poor Truckers hauling goods in high security Systems where most of the population live in what they believe to be safe space. Study the Market tickers, Learn to gain some of the best income in the game which is just sitting in station buying and selling to becoming an Isk empire. 

  It takes months to get decent skills, I will not argue the difficulty of becoming higher quality. However with Ambitions and a Strong Alliance or Milita behind you, people will flock to your aid, help you become better. In Eve we all know one very important survival tactic, Teach others, and they will protect you.  

  You will either love it or you will hate it, However you must first, study, research, learn. Eve is a lifestyle, it's meant to be, In as close of an aspect of what universal warfare would be like, its a struggle, Every day is a struggle, Everytime you undock believe that your ship is dead, and you must fly to reclaim its life.

  In Eve, when it dies, Its gone for good.

The problem is that game is not the game you download and play. The game had a lot of good potential, but there are many flaws that a new player comes into the game have to jump in order to enjoy the game.

First the game is overly complex and relies on pop-up menus too much. This game is to MMORPG what ARMA series is too FPS. A game is suppose to be fun to play, detatch you from reality. Unfortunately like ARMA this game tries to make space exploration too much like reality. Which means HOURS wasted just getting from point A to point B. Extended periods of time working on controls. And dear go the amount of pop-up screens you have at any time to play the game effectivly is insane. I have 2 monitors, and the game on both of them, and I STILL feel like I do not have enough screen space to play. Yet of all the complex controls, huge amount of details, and 'sand box' feel the game is lacking in some very basic concepts. 

Like why is there STILL not an option to have camera follow enable on your ship so you are always away and above your ship? If there is I do not see it online and it is not easy to find in the 8 control menus under options. Why do heat sinks and mining lasers look the same in my inventory? Are you telling me you cannot create different icons for the two? These sorts of details can really irritate you and pull you out of the world the developers try to make for the gamer.

The game is presented to us as a 'sand box' space game where the developers just maintain the box. In reality the game is more of a 'desert'. I mean that for 90% of the new players just coming in with no idea what the game is, like myself, you are lost. Sure I get a tutorial type missions, which waste about 10-15 hour of the basic 'go here and drop off x' 'mine y' 'kill z'. The missions are useful, they provide the player with the basics on what to do and how to do it, but they are way overkill. After about 2 hours in I found myself putting the ship on auto pilot and watching netflix (more on this later). But the worst part if after the missions a player has no direction. I get this is suppose to be part of the lure of the game, being full sandbox. But I found myself running through my options of what to do afterward and the answer was very limited.

Why was I limited on what I can do, it is because of how the skills are earned in Eve. Most games skills are learned from 'Do X 100 times' or 'Kill Y 100 times' and you earn xp. It is a very proactive approach. But in Eve it is 'spend Z time'. Not spend time in game, not spend time doing something, just...spend...time. So as I speak right now my character is leveling up. Even though I am not doing anything or playing the game. The main draw back from this is I cannot accelerate my character (without spending real life money) to get to my goals. And seeing how every little detail in eve, from the ship you fly, to the weapon you use, has a skill point that needs to be leveled in order to use, I have to waste real life money or a ton of time to get to any sort of enjoyable content. 

Example you look at youtube videos on exploring, combat, hacking anything and you want to try one of those paths. Well in order to get to, for instance, (entry level ship) combat in low security space (more open to PVP and harder PVE) it takes 15 days. 2 weeks of having an account to do almost anything in game. Now this isn't new, WoW use to require a month of play time to get to end game content. But WoW gave you stuff to do in the mean time, leveling proactivly. Eve doesn't give you direction. So here I am, waiting for skills to level up, to go do something fun, using the entry level ship.

Now to be fair there are things to do while we wait. Explore, Mine, and combat. But all of these have to be done in high security space, which means almost no threat and little reward. I hear people saying 'Do you expect to step into a game and do end game content? You have to start somewhere.' In most games no I do not expect that, but in Eve I do. And the reason is again the true 'sand box' environment that is promoted and the lack of direction the developers give gamers. Litteral make New Eden what you want it to be. How do you claim you give gamers full independence, yet put in a horrible XP mechanic that limits them, not by skill, not by time played, not by money earned, but by how long they have their account? And this brings me to my last point.

The game is more of an AFK simulator and has almost no skill profieciency when it comes to PvE. You want to know how to get to point A -> B that is 15 jumps away? Set destination and put on auto pilot, watch netflix. How do you mine? Point to rock, hit 1 button, watch netflix and wait. I know what you are thinking, 'Most games are like that, you are being to harsh on Eve'. No, no I am not. I can excuse mining and auto pilot travel for being boring, it is a game mechanic that is hard to keep someone interested in. But when it requires 0 interation from me for hours on end, that is boring. I watched 10+ hours of netflix while my character did something in game with no interaction from me. Except for me point him in another direction to do the same automated action. And the worst part is PvE isn't much better!

Space combat in this game is HORRIBLE. It takes no skill at all. Now I cannot speak to PvP since I cannot do that for another 2 weeks due to the XP mechanic. But PvE combat is horrible. Target X, push auto laser button, profit. This is the extent of the skill you need. True story, I went into low security last night with a ship you get from the starting quest. I found a Battleship (4-5 levels in ship class above me). My experience 'fighting' it. Target, orbit, auto fire, afk. For 25 minutes my entry level ship, flew circles around a battleship hitting it with lasers. I did NOTHING, I was watching TV while I waited for it to kill the battleship. No resource management, no tactical manuevers, no worries. I didn't have to work to get an angle, didn't have to manage what lasers fired in what order, I didn't even have to worry about my shields recharging. When I can take on an NPC, that is at least 4 tiers higher than me while I am on the toliet, the game is broken/borning.

And for being such a complicated game, I would say overly complicated, yet having the core concept of Space Combat/Exploration/Mining being able to be done on 95% auto pilot. That is a shitty made game, and a poor gaming experience.",1509304156,1509304175,False,3,0,0.522026538848876953,2,True,False,False

This game will probably be around alot longer then steam and I realize you may think that is ludacris, but 14 years ago when this game came out, steam was simply a way for them to sell one game, half-life. I have played over 5000 Hours of this game. Been playing since it came out. I only recommend it for people not looking to play a video game but live in another reality. This is not a game. Its a lifestyle. You will get a job in game and it will be boring. You will be betrayed by people you thought were helping you learn the game only to learn that your work is worth more to them then your loyalty. No one will trust you and it will take a long time to earn peoples trust and respect. I talk not in weeks or even months but years. This is another life you are commiting to. And if you simply play it for a couple of days and come back in a couple of months you will not get anything out of it.

However, this is probably the most in-depth and realistic expierence a video game will ever give you. Every ship you fly and every bullet you fire is made by a person. There is no place safe, although there are consequences in High-sec and low sec that does not mean you will not get blown up there. There are no restrictions on what you can and can not do except for real life threats and racisim. There are not alot of things to do, there are unlimited things to do. I have made a living doing the following activities.

-Mining, refining, and selling ore and minerals.
-Camping low sec gates for Null Sec bound trasports, destroying them and taking whatever is left in the debris
-Transporting High Sec bought ships and fits to low sec pirate stations for sale at a 30% markup.
-Exploring WH space for lightly defended Starbases and selling the location to blood thirsty aholes.
-Contracting for HS wars between care bear companies.
-Escorting Jump freighters pre and post warp
-Living in WH space and killing NPCs and people who wander in.
-Contracting for recon using twitch.tv and a small stealth ship.

The list goes on and on. The most fun I have ever had playing this was living in a wormhole with a LS connection and doing faction warfare out of the wormhole. At the time I lived in the wormhole with a bunch of pirates who would raid Null Sec. When we weren't active they would sit in stealth ships next to me and when someone came to kill me they would uncloak and blow them up. With the connection to Low sec changing everyday there were always fresh victims to kill. It took me over 6 years of playing to get to a point where I could accomplish this goal and I continued to live in that worm hole for a year and a half before someone from another wormhole came in and blew up all our crap costing us over $4000 real world dollars worth of stuff including, all our ships, all our loot and even the space stations we were living out of. The group that did it took all of our stuff that wasn't blown up and left with it back into there wormhole.

If any of this interests you and your life is stable with plenty of free time, then this game might be for you. Its not Pay2Win in anyway. It doesn't have any retarted rules. Nothing you do in game will ever get you kicked out except racisim and threatening people with real life violence.",1509227750,1509229003,True,0,0,0.441505759954452515,0,True,False,False

This game will probably suck if you are under 25 year old. This is not your instant gratification hand holding everyone is a winner and deserves a medal game. This game is one of those oldschool games where you actually gotta put in the hours to be even half decent capsuleer. And by this I mean you probably won't be commanding space armies in your first couple years of playing EVE. One of the newer trailer has a New Eden streamer saying ""This game, you're not ready for it"" and this is true for many of you reading this.

You will struggle to achieve any of your goals, there will be setbacks and more often than not other players standing on your way. It will be painful trying to solo PvP at first, fights are not fair and you won't be able to afford all the same toys as people who have played for years. EVE is dying, this is a long running meme and also the nature of the game. You will die. You will lose the ship you worked hours for. It will sting, sometimes really hard - losing a super capital will more than likely set you back months unless you are a space tycoon.

I get it, it sucks. Why would anyone wanna play this?

Because its challenging. Accomplishing something even relatively small in this game will feel better than any headshot killing spree you've done in your run-of-the-mill shooter or any epic/mega-epic-multi-important item you get by running the theme park MMOs dungeons.

It's like a simulation of real life. That being said, I love this game, I'm just not enough of a jerk. I would call them assholes, but steam censors that word.

Here's my experience:

-Learned the controls. They were super complicated which I loved. It takes a long time to get used to moving your ship around in combat and shooting. It takes a lot of know-how to fit a ship well, either through experimentation, or through reading a wiki. Deliciously complex.

-Did missions to get money. Easiest way to make money in the beginning that I found. Doing combat missions nets quite a bit of money, not to mention the salvage operation you can do on the corpses of ships.

-Got enough money to buy a good mining vessel. It wasn't huge, but it did the job well.

-Grinded mining 'till I could afford the big boy. The massive mining barge. Yeah!

-First day of mining, ship got blowed up. In high-sec. (If you don't know what high-sec is, it stands for high-security. Basically, if you attack someone or are attacked unlawfully, NPC controlled police ships called the CONCORD will come in, rather quickly, and blow the attacking ship into dust.) Appearently, this is a common thing. I looked it up, it's called suicide ganking. People outfit a ship to be strong enough to take down an expensive mining vessel quickly enough before the CONCORD get on them. The only goal is to destroy something that's more expensive than what you lose in the suicide gank. If you do that, you win.

-Right after the suicide gank, the guy who killed me sent me a message. He said I was guilty of inattentive mining and mining without a ""permit,"" and if I didn't want other ""accidents"" to happen to my ship in his company's ""territory"", I should log online and pay his company some unreasonably high amount of ISK (in-game money) monthly. Say what you want, but this sounds like the mafia to me. The company that produces this game will do nothing, absolutely nothing, not a damn thing about these people. They simply allow it to happen. I refuse to play a game that supports the mafia.

This game is amazing. I love it. So much fun. 'Till you meet a jerk or a group of jerks. And trust me, it'll happen. This is NOT an isolated incident.

Edit:

I've gotten a lot of flak for this review, and everyone says the same thing over and over again in the comments: ""Don't fly what you can't afford to lose."" ""That's just the way the game is."" ""Stop sobbing over PvP."" ""Don't take it personally."" ""What a nub."" Or they end up giving me some arbitrary advice on how to play the game *properly*. I really wish people would read the comments previously placed before adding their own, so that they'd realize what they want to say has already been said.

Yeah, I know that's the way the game is played, and I don't like it. That's why this is a negative review. It's my personal account of the game and WHY I don't like it.

This is neither the first time nor the last time I was screwed over in the game, this is just the one that I remember the most vividly and pisses me off the most.

This review isn't for the elites who know the in's and the out's of the game, it's for those who wish to start the game right now. The elites know the dangers of the game and know how to deal with and avoid them, but they also know how to screw you over. They know the loopholes in the rules such as the one described in this review. I posted this review to warn new players of the dangers the elite will thrust upon you. I warn you to either tell you to stay away from this game entirely, or be prepared to be fucked in the ass again and again and again. You will be screwed over in ways you couldn't imagine, and everyone else's advice to you will be, ""Get over it."" 

They. Are. Ruthless.

Edit #2:
So, I recently found this fucking gold-mine of sociopaths: http://www.minerbumping.com/p/the-code.html

The major comparisons that can be made between this and Mein Kampf are endless. Seriously, go read some of the stuff from that site, then come back here.

Mein Kampf (for those who don’t know) was Hitler’s work. He talked mainly philosophy on how the Jews were a burden on “normal people.” He even refers to the world he wants to create without the Jews as the “New Order.” He talks about saving Jews from themselves, and even calls them the “Jewish Peril.” Hitler referred to the destruction of the weak and weak-willed as a good thing to ensure the continuation of the strong. He talks about certain rules the Jews should follow to live in the ""Greater Germany."" If you don’t see a comparison yet, then you haven’t read anything from the link I provided. Honestly, if Mein Kampf was still copyrighted, I'd call it play plagiarism.

Don't believe me? Look up Mein Kampf. Seriously, here's the link to the wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf. Do your own research if you don't believe me.

Got boring real fast playing ""Warp Drive Active"" 90% watching ship travel from A to B. Might as well go mow the lawn while waiting for your ship to do 20 jumps except Auto pilot is too dangerous, so you have to manually sit at the keyboard clicking jump gates for 10 minutes of grinding excitement. If you want to build up a bigger ship you have to go through PvP areas to buy better ships, guns etc.

Character generation is just a profile picture, doesn't mean anything in game. Can't do anything with planets, you can literally can run into planets, stars and asteroids and nothing happens. You will need to google some missions to work out how to complete them as ingame instructions from the agents are a vague.

I enjoyed the game playing initial PvE but unfortunately the whole game is PvP everywhere and with plenty of scum players who just open fire on you without warning in ships that massively outclass you. Also if you join a clan you may find it means you are now a target for PvP ganking by opposing clans everywhere, even while still doing noob missions. I spent hours grinding and buying stuff to create ships still doing noob missions and got ganked coming out of jumps without having a chance to run or fire a shot so many times. My final straw was building up a next level ship and getting spawn ganked by a clan who think 12 vs 1 noob is fun, never even got to fire a shot or a chance to run. Lost interest after my $30 intro subscription month ended, you have to subscribe to own certain ships and it seems if you let subscription lapse you lose them, so no subscription from me for this.

The tutorial has gotten a much needed overhaul, however to do a full tutorial, it would last well over 30 days. There is THAT MUCH stuff to do in this game.

And when I say that i mean: The ore is mined by players, then refined by players, then items are manufactured from thosed minerals by players, then flown by players, then destroyed by players.

Combat is clicking on a red crosshair, click gun firing button on, right click to set orbit distance, wait til something dies, repeat.

I have so much time played since I'd often quit and come back as stories of warring player groups over resources in the game, earning riches on the deep player driven economy, or exploring the vastness of the universe pulled me back in. Every time I'd quit after a month or so of playing as I noticed that 80% or more was spent preparing to have fun experiences that were both fleeting and hard to find.

Let's take player combat as an example. Like most games with open world PvP encounters are typically uncompetitive fights of unequal strength groups. In Eve the vastness of the universe also made it difficult to find fights at all, if you set aside 2 hours to get some ship battles you'll typically be traveling for 90% of it if you're lucky. Combined with the boring tedium that actually manipulating the ship in combat entails I often was asking myself what the point was.

Ok, maybe space combat in Eve isn't for me. Maybe I'd be happier being a silly blockade running space trucker or something. Well get prepared to wait again, the innovative real time based skill system means that if you need certain skills to try a different game experience the only thing you can do is wait, there are no ways to speed up the process by grinding experience like you could in other games. This might be a good idea if the time scales were reasonable, but I'd often be staring down the barrel of a 3 or 6 month training plan.

The amount of things you kill / do does not effect the XP gain rate.  There are different weapon systems to focus on with mutually exclusive skill trees for guns / missiles.  A ton of other skills exist to make your ships better (so as to be faster, tougher, and more able to mount better equipment), crafting, scanning, and some other types which would be hard to talk about in this semi-brief review.  Quests come in the form of ""corporate contracts"" which are kill this, deliver that, the usual fare with rewards to help get you going.  So here is my heart to heart to you the possible new EVE player;

Eve is hard.

Eve is even harder alone especially early on.

Type in ""Eve online corporation recruiting"" in google, or look at the forums.  Join a corporation.

If you do not do this you will hate EVE.  You must be somewhat social especially early on.  Working as a team, and accomplishing big goals like destroying big ships / taking territory / tasting the salty tears of your enemies is VERY fulfilling to me in this game.  Given the difficulty of doing even mundane tasks in this game the thrill of success comes with a feeling of satisfaction that I have found in few other games (everquest, and DAoC comes to mind).  You can now make an alpha character, and give the game a go for free.  You would be limited in what you can fly, and what skills you can train.  It is the opportunity to get a feel for the gameplay without anything other than a time investment.  

If blowing up online spaceships has any appeal to you give EVE Online a try, and join an active corporation to get a good feel for the game.",1503364664,1503364664,True,0,0,0.48657718300819397,0,True,False,False

No its not CCP will continue to devalue and increase value in certain items they seem fit to manipulate the market into more mass account style.

latest proofs of this is here https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=521682

wich if i quote ""We are making this change because Carriers & Supercarriers are too strong in PvE, specifically anomaly ratting in Nullsec. As you may have seen in the May Monthly Economy Report, there is a significant upward trend in the Money Supply. This is primarily due to NPC Bounties.""

now this is directly a player economic.

CCP makes all sort of claims that RISK versus Reward is their goal right ?
well lets analyze this shall we.

A vni is about 130 mill on the field makes around 18-20 mill per 20 min give or take.
Ishtar is about 300 mill on the field makes around 24 mill per 20 min
Carrier is about 3-4 billion on the field makes around 40-60 mill per 20 min and is under COnstant attacks and can be ganked at any time fairly easy very high risk!
Highsec battleships in 3 bill fits wich cannot be ganked and has no risk makes around 75 mill per tick aka no risk doing incursions
now the carrier is the one getting the nerf couse it makes to much money ?
somewhere in ccp logic failed the people.

Second proof that the economics is not player driven is rorquals.
Mining has allways been the lowest form of income in the food chain.
they where given rorquals to get money.
after rorquals was put out they got nerfed around 3-5 times untill they now barely sustain themselfs.
and roruqals has to seaige up in order to gain money wich makes them a increadible easy target.
now not to mention their mining drones cost 1.1 billion each!!

Another proof that its not a sandbox game is that CCP did hire an entire staff of economics guys to handle the ingame economics wich is odd if its suppose to be free and made by players no ?

so in short EVE is NOT a sandbox game and therefor HAS NO player driven economics.
i would advice people to check what they want from the game before going into it.
But also Eve online have many great aspects dont get me wrong.
you got trade exploration and much more.
but Capital gameplay is very under developed and needs refine ment not nerfs.
we need more content not less and more things to do with our capitals not less.
Improve the capitals improve the anomolies would be far greater than nerfing the capitals to dust.",1497090895,1503245207,False,85,2,0.613190650939941406,0,True,False,False

First...let me start with ""I hate RTS games and I don't like RPG games"".  I wouldn't even give WOW the time of day...

I made a review for this game about a year ago and I still feel the same as I did when I first started playing.  This past December EVE went ""free to play"".  You can have Alpha accounts with a level cap of 5 million skill points and you are faction limited on ships you can use up to cruisers(with the exception of the Gnosis, and the Venture mining ship along with a few others).

I have seen too many complaints about how it isn't free to play, or it's a trial, or whatever else.  I have over 3000 hours on this account alone, a couple thousand on an alt account, and about 1000 hours on yet another alt account dedicated to alphas.  I enjoy using my alphas because they are great for testing new playstyles and they are quite capable of handling themselves in combat.  I got a 90 million isk kill on my second day alpha in wormhole space.  You can do this too!

Now I can see your complaint...""but you have 3000 hours in the game"".  Well, we all start somewhere.  There are mutliple tutorials on youtube with many dedicated individuals who want to bring you content and help.  There is a help chat in game to answer quick questions you may have.  Above all, be patient.  Use PVE to learn how to move your ship and fire your guns and then go after PVP.  

...and I got sick of typing so I am just going to let it end with the old review lol.  Enjoy!

Old review;
Considering it's really all I play anymore and I actually don't like these kind of games...You can do whatever you want.  You are on a massive server with right now 40,000 people.  There are battles going on, big guys picking on the little guys and then the bigger guys kill the big guys...and the little guys.  

""If you can't afford to lose it, don't use it""
""By undocking your ship, you consent to pvp""

These are quotes from the devs.  It is challenging, rewarding and severly punishing.  If you did something and got blown up, you have nobody to blame but yourself.  This is EVE!  Welcome, fly dangerous!",1479969617,1502610208,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Reason 1:  

Your ability to do much in this game is tied directly to how well trained your character is with the bazillion skill traits that are available to you.  Unlike other MMO's, these skills do not improve with use.  Rather, they are added to a skill queue where they are constantly training in the background ( even while logged off ).  There are five levels to any given skill and each level takes longer to train than the previous one.  Initial levels of the skill can take maybe half an hour to train, whereas the level V variants of a single skill can take upwards of a MONTH.   You can only train a single skill at any given time.  So if you want to train three level five skills, ( after you've trained the pre-requisite skills and skill levels I-IV ) you can be looking at three months timewise.  

There are two account types.  Alpha and Omega.  Alphas are free to play, but are limited in what skills they can train and what ships they can fly.  Omegas are the subscription accounts and can train and use all skills and ships.  They even train skills at 2x the rate of Alphas ( but still can take up to a Month to train a Level V skill, which means an Alpha would need TWO months to train it ) but it's still a long wait.  In order to fly some ships at an Expert Level ( Level V Mastery ) or even some of the larger ships ( Capitol ships and the like ), it can easily take YEARS of 24/7 training time in order to do so. 

There are some implants you can buy / outfit to boost your training times a bit, but the good ones are horrendously expensive and come with a risk that I will talk about next.  


Reason 2:

Eve is open PVP.  The 'world space' is broken into various security ratings.  High-Sec, Low-Sec, Null-Sec and Wormhole Space.  There is some protection from PvP in High-Sec space, but not 100%.  Very little or none in the others.  This basically means that you can be attacked and destroyed pretty much anywhere in game for any reason.  The lower the security rating for a system, the greater the liklihood of you having a bad day.  

The problem, from my perspective anyway, is new players are trying to come into the game to learn it ( Eve has the steepest learning curve of any game I've ever played in twenty years of online gaming ) but are pretty much cannon fodder for the existing veteran players who have no qualms about killing you just because they enjoy doing so.  

As a new player in a new ship with very few skills trained, you'll come through a JumpGate ( the mechanism utilized to warp you from one Solar System to another ) into what's known as a GateCamp.  Where members will sit and wait for ships to come through, then destroy them.  No reason, just because. 

These folks are usually veterans flying high level ships, outfitted with the best equipment and backed up with years worth of skill training.  Not to mention, you're likely going to run into a group of anywhere from three to a dozen ships.  

Basically, you're walking into a trap with zero warning and absolutely no means to survive it.  Any work, ISK ( money ) and / or effort you have put into the ship you're flying or the cargo you're carrying will be lost.  Additionally, recall the implants I mentioned above that reduce your skill training time ?   The best ones are stupidly expensive ( half a billion ISK or more for the set ) and if you die ( most gate campers will kill your pod after they destroy your ship just because ) you not only have lost your ship, any cargo you were carrying, but those very expensive implants get destroyed as well.  



You'll basically need to join a Corporation ( Eve's version of a guild ) in order to survive, though doing so has it's own issues as well if your Corp is at war with one or more other Corps.  


It's a very frustrating experience overall.  Maybe later on once you have enough skills trained to fly better ships and outfit them with better equipment it changes.  There are those who say skill makes the pilot and I will acknowledge that to a degree.  It is, in my opinion, only part of the equation as a highly skilled pilot in a starter ship using starter equipment still has zero chance of survival when warping into a gate camp comprised of overwhelming numbers, ships and equipment. 


For the existing folks, it's probably a fun game. 


For any who are just now thinking about playing, it's just a whole lot of frustration.

EVE is arguably the most free MMORPG to date but because of this, it is also the most brutal MMO in gaming history. You have the freedom to do whatever you want, and so does the person/corporation/alliance whos sole goal is to ruin your time in the game. Wars in EVE are faught with ships and fittings, but many of them are won by attrition. If you want to be the best at EVE (Good luck with that) you have to be able to make your enemies not even bother to log in. Do you see where this is going? Pain and salt is practically the currency used in this game, and their sweet smell is what drives many players. 

Now if you can look past alll of that you have a wonderful game with the most realistic and powerful economy in gaming history. The visuals are stunning and are realatively not taxing on most rigs, with some exceptions. The U.I. is one of the best I've ever worked with, yes, there is a surplus of details and buttons to click.

This is balanced because of the amount of experience you need and the know how. EVE online isn't a small game. It's literally a vast universe of content ranging from:
- PVP - Solo, Small Gang (less than 15 or so), Fleet (dozens upon dozens :). PVP has sooo many different possibilities its crazy and amazing at the same time. Some mechanics of the game aren't documented anywhere so you have to experiement a little to find some specifics out. 
- PVE - Usually solo, Great way to make ISK (in game currency). Missions (provided by agents), Combat anomalies (Alt+P for probe scanner), Incursions (the end game of PVE. these NPC's are tough) 
- Mining and Industry - Not too huge on this myself but you mine, reprocess the ore into minerals, use blueprints and the minerals to make lots of different stuff (modules, ships, etc). In a few months this will be changing quite a bit so :)
Some industry requires you to combine materials from mining, Planetary Interaction, Salvage and Reactors. The stuff you can make when you combine that stuff is awesome (the wait time isn't :( )
Those are some of the things you can do while playing EVE online. I'll admit there's a few bugs here and there and a few things are OP and or 'annoying' (Interceptor fleets, Assault frigs/cruisers and my personal favourite: Snatch fleets)

Don't expect to understand this game in 5 minutes or even a week (or even a few years) as there's simply too much to know. But all that waiting pays off when you're able to fly Tech 2 and even Tech 3 Ships as well as capital ships. I mean... who doesn't like the Vendetta? Or the memeing nagalfar? Or the Tristan?

This game is about making friends. If not friends, then contacts at the very least. You can't win by yourself, and thats the whole point.

And by that I mean COOPERATION - not the me-me-me style of play that all to many players seem to think is the only way to play and ""win"" a game.

To really get into the game, you have to go through the stages - at first you feel like you are not learning fast enough, not contributing enough etc. but that is the time to really enjoy all the new stuff you learn every day. And there really is endless amounts of stuff to learn. After having flown all the larger battleships you will start enjoying and really understanding why the small ships are tons of fun. But this you can only do in the larger corporations - there you will find fleets to join, operations to participate in and missions with real meaning ( as well as missions with no meaning :D well, missions you create yourself with small gangs from your corp. and where you create your own meaning and suspense. Camp gates, do hit and runs, defend your space etc. ad infinitum. The possibilities first reveal themselves after you have tried to join the really vast parts of EVE that evolve in the larger scheme of things and by becoming part of it.

The self-proclaimed sandbox, has a huge universe with tons of things to do.
But you are kind of left to find out what you want to do yourself.
When you start playing this game, one of two things will happen.
Either you get bored really quickly because you run out of stuff to do,
or you realise just how many possibilities this game really has to offer and get hooked forever.

Most of the content in this game is created by interaction with other players.
That can be blowing up internet spaceships and getting russian swears thrown at you in chat,
or building things out of mined materials that other people then buy,
or just making terrible jokes on Team Speak with your mates while blowing up wave after wave of NPCs.

What I also find amazing is that in this game almost everything is allowed.
There are no PvP arenas to balance out the strenghts of both sides.
There are just a lot of people with their own goals and ideas thrown together into space.
It makes you pay attention to your surroundings.
You can make friends with corperations to gain their trust and make new friends, or to then steal everything once they allow you into their higher ranks, scamming people out of their money just because they are gullible.
Granted I havn't done any of the later, but just knowing it's possible makes oneself incredibly perceptive of all the little scams and things around me.

Has it's ups and downs like any good game but it's a beast thanks to the player base and it's come to stay (been here for 14 years) and i bet will outlive many more games in the future. Definetly a good time investment. 

I've been playing since 2009 not on steam obviously but now have an alt here, and done mostly all, but there's always something more. From missioning and mining in High sec to faction warfare, pirating, exploration and living in wormholes. 
Joining null sec alliances and playing many sides in so many battles and fun activities that I can only describe as the most fantastic social experience on the internet. ""Internet Space Ships is Serious business!"" 
There's always something new to do and the game mechanics exist only to let players free their imagination and come up with new ways to play the game. You make your own story not the other way around. 
From fleet pvp and other alliance activities depending on the alliance you choose, like drunken roams (so much fun), camping gates and systems like an ass (lol) to Moon mining and all the logistics from marketing to mining, construction and POS and citadel maintaining, that are the backbone of any alliance worth their salt.
To pipe bombing and being Pipe bombed, never forget Pipe bombs! and so much more, there's always more.

The game is so HUGE in depth that takes a long time to understand in its entirety but is not as hard as you might think at first impression, and most of the fun is in it's ever changing atmosphere since it's the players that act most of that change. 
Every year there's also elections to vote for the CSM (Council of Stellar Management). You vote on your candidates to elect players to represent you, and they will together with the company (CCP) discuss any change that may be implemented. So you have your voice. Of course that voice maybe bias and elections rigged but it's all player made like a real social experience with all the upsides and downsides of a real society. Space politics in it's many forms are such a serious thing it's mindblowing. And if players don't like something as a whole, magic happens and the community unites in protest either causing server overload or joining in mass unsubscriptions to make their voices heard. That happened before many times and will no doubt happen again in the future and its fantastic to watch. Hopefully people become as passionate to real world issues as the EvE community is about their game. 

On EvE, your reallife skill and you as a person counts much more than the strength and skill of your character. A 2 days character can kill a 14 years veteran easily in the right situation.

So, 
CCP is both hated and loved but, even after Fozzie sov and the most recent carrier nerfs that made so much controversy is still one of the best companies around that came from small indy tabletop selling to fund the game to the giant that is today listening to the community and serving the players much more than trying to impose their will on a game they realise its not theirs anymore but the players.
 
The community is the most passionate one you will ever find and they can go from Gigantic Assholes to the most helpful friends you'll ever find on a game. From toxic to loving, but it also depends on day and situation and depends mostly on how you react to it. If you want to have your hands held and complain about everything, not being pro active to find solutions you might find youself in a world of trouble and even become a meme, but if you want to learn and do not mind losing a few ships and laughing at it with others, you might find real life friends that will endure the years and have the most fun together an internet game can offer.  Players have so many sub cultures, inside jokes and ways of living and sharing experiences that are as complex as the human mind can come up with.

If you want a REAL unconstraining MMORPG made by CCP but created by players, that has no guidelines and is much more a social experience true to life and to the Chaos Theory where yourself and your reactions count much more than the ship or character you are using as an avatar, brace yourself and jump in.

They know we as players want this economy to be fixed in game by being able to plex our accounts in side the game, so they dont care about the economy and this problem.  They know players can make, generate, and take isk in the game, so we can play this game for free, and they will care about the economuy and this problem.  The story goes like that and it will not change.  They haven't been doing the best and that is ok every company makes a mistake here and there.  

What ccp is trying to do is make players and I generating isk through buying more of their plex while their point of view and opinion is that nothing we do inside this game will and should be enough to get our ships back once they are destroyed, so we can have an incentive to sell our plex in game to cover our ship losses and that this will solve all our problems and they will compound the problem further by making us pay for our yearly subscription.  This means they will use plex as their little extra asset to get more money out of the game and this means they will continue in the future to nerf ships like the Vexor Navy Issue,  Ishtars,  Carriers, and Rorquals because they are prime targets for making isk in the game right now and soon it will be DED sites and so on.

Miss 'Assassination from the eve forums said "",  Anything that puts the final nail in the coffin of ""end-game content"" also puts a huge nail in the coffin of many players' hopes and dreams.  A lot of us started playing with dreams of joining an Alliance and forging our empire,  eventually flying supers and titans, and participating in these epic giant space battles.  CCP has been repeatedly attacking that dream on multiple fronts: sov changes that promote isolation and lack of interaction, citadels that promote lack of interaction, making supercaps cheap and accessible so they're no longer as special, nerfing anything appealling into the ground and leaving people with cumulative centuries of wasted training across the playerbase, and more.  Some players with that dream like me have been holding, hoping things get better.  If CCP finally kills that dream a lot of players are going to leave and many more won't join the game in the first place.""

CCP you want to nerf carriers by 100 and then stop halfway when you get mostly complaints.  No you put that damage back the way it was originally or you stick with your changes all the way through, so we know who's side you are really on.  Are you on the customers complaining side or are you on your own side?

CCP stop this!   CCP don't do it!  And CCP listen to your customers and the people on your forums.

There's a vast - I mean properly vast, takes hours to get end to end, assuming you even survive - galaxy out there to explore, and you can do pretty much ANYTHING you want. Be an adventurer out dog-fighting pirates; play the markets to become a trillionaire and never leave a space station; build factory complexes on distant worlds to produce strange and exotic wares; explore remote and mysterious wormholes to discover ancient alien relics; research and corner the market in cutting-edge technology; spend all day mining rare minerals in icey asteroid belts; I mean, the list goes on and on and on.

So in this galaxy of near-infinite possibilities, what do a disproportionate number of people choose to become?

Muggers.

Seriously, you've got a simulation of the far future with a whole galaxy to play in, what sort of person do you have to be to think that the ultimate use of such a simulation is to spend hours and hours every day hanging around distant jump gates hoping some fellow player is going to wander through so you can mug them?

The good: Immersive, large galaxy, always something new to try out.

The BAD:

- new players are heavily targetted by veterans who want easy gains.  New players frequently lose everything they have and go broke due to ganks by 5+ year veterans of the game.  The developers not only allow this, but encourage it.

- 3rd person flight controls only

- The ""player controlled economy"" is a half lie: the devs can and do intervene in the economy of the game. Although player production does effect the economy, CCP has ""adjusted"" in game prices often.  Plex prices and supply, for example, have been manipulated by devs in the past and are subject to manipulation at any time.  The half truth is CCP usually allows player supply to drive the economy more than any direct price/supply manipulation by the devs.

-1 player per ship, no matter how big that ship is in game.  Absolutely no chance at multi-player crewed ships or boarding due to the limits of the game design.

- There are only 2 modes: 3rd person space flight or you are in your room in a station spinning your ships.  If you want more, wait for Star Citizen like the rest of us. ;)


- If you don't Pay 2 Win, it will take you a very, very, VERY long time to not be gank bait for veteran players in this game.

Play at your own risk.  

If you like space combat and exploration, pass on purchasing EvE Online and check out Star Citizen instead.

I say this because if you read all the negative reviews of the game you will understand its a game where you really do have to guard your self and suspect many of the people you meet as potential enemys.  The game recieves major up date (expansion) every 6 months so there is allways new content being added and old content being tweaked.  

NOt every one in EVE is bad but almost every one is out to make a dollar (isk, glory) off you if they can, sometimes that means killing you and looting you wreckage for stuff to sell or just simply killing you for the kill mail.  CCP tries to stay very hand off without trying to directly influence any aspect of game so compaining to them because you got killed isnt going to work.  it may be a game but its a game that hold consequinces that feel real to all who play it.  That first time you build a ship or kill another player, it all holds a real feeling of acomplishment with it.  This also mean you will feel your losses as well, many times they will feel unfair but it wont be.  

The most important rule of EVE Online is simple, never fly what you cant afford to lose.  

Follow this rule and you will learn to accept your loses and gain from them on what not to do next time.  Your mistakes will become the brick and mortar that you build a vast and very deep adventure for your self in New Eden.

To me the community is a tight group and unwelcoming to new players and look down on them as they dont know what they are doing, could almost say they treat F2P players as ruining their game.

If I could describe this game in one word it would be Cool. Not amazing, not brilliant, not engaging, just sheer coolness. It's extremely detailed and will amaze you when you first play it. After you test your limits and get blown up a few times, you begin to farm for money and that is when the game becomes slightly work-driven. The game can be exciting at times (as the more risky places to farm are always more profitable) but the level of fun will be dictated by the amount you are willing to risk for it.

This is what I call a ""google game"". Knowlege is power and the more time you spend online doing research, the more freedoms you have with this game. Learning how to explore the vastness of space will require you to study both outside and inside the game (books are needed to level up).

So much to do, and everything plays a part of it.

PvE players provide meta guns and pirate blueprints to traders. Traders sell them off to PvP players or Industrialist. And Industrialist create ships for PvP players and PvE players.

Find your niche, whether it's mining, exploration, drug making, pillaging or afk trading. Everything is intertwine with one another and so EvE is literally a breathing universe where there is market and demand for everyone.

Also try joining Null security for big fights or Low security corporation for small gang roams. I particularly like small gang roam more, of 30 person or below and dunk other people. The game is no fun solo. Like most MMO it's hard if you go solo. Unless you own hundreds of moon.

EVE is a very complex game. The learning curve is absolutely insane. However it is a sandbox like no other. Complete freedom of choice with whatever you wish to do.  With the ability to negate your monthly subscription through in game items, and all expansions are free, its a game that anyone can dive into and prosper. The skill training is in real time so even when your offline you are still making progress in EVE.

If you can get past the immense learning curve you will find a dark atmospheric game with player freedom like no other. This is what keeps me coming back to the game, EVE is like no other MMO on the market. It doesnt hold your hand, loss is real, and consequences are many. 

As of ~Decemberish 2016, EVE has a free to play option, where you can experience most of the game, but are unable to fly higher end ships, or use the better skills. I highly recommend to try it since its free, and not be immediately overwhelmed upon logging in. EVE has a vast number of resources to help, and just gives you the tools to accomplish whatever you want. 

What EVE excels in is truly making you feel like member of a vast space universe.",1387583405,1494804641,True,0,0,0.46875,0,True,False,False

Step 1: This game punishes stupidity. (Being drunk on coms and losing a stupid expensive ship gets you an auto kick from corp... still funny though.  Thanks KB mail for showing what players did after they wake up)

Step 2: This game hates you and everything about you. (Don't expect sympathy you will get 'pointed' and laughed at right before getting the pod express back to station)

Step 3: Don't fly something you can't afford to lose.  (""Don't worry bro it's clear jump in with your JF. JUMP! JUMP! JUMP!."")

Step 4: Find your niche and stick with it! (The markets are not PvE it's a whole different level of PvP just to fund your next super-cap loss or to see how many people will add to your bounty while sitting in Jita)

I came in incredibly intimidated by everything I ever heard of about this game, especially the steep learning curve and heavy PVP aspect. I grabbed a venture, started mining, slowly made a little isk, got ganked, made more isk, found a new, small, indy corp in HighSec. We all grew together, made friends, slowly skilled up, got war dec, got ganked, skilled up more, made more isk, time went on and I learned something new literally every day. Now we're in an indy alliance living in Null. Made new friends, learned a lot more, had to skill up in things I never thought I'd ever use, and there's plenty to do everyday. Now I go on roams, get drunk and gate camp, go out on large coalition fleets with hundreds of other players (also drunk), blow up citadels, mine null sec ore with maxed Exhumers, go ratting in my VNI, the list goes on. Sometimes I sit there in my Hulk mining and I think back to my days in a venture where it would take me 2 hours to make what I do now in ten minutes. I'm only less than half a year in, if veterans of this game read this they'll probably say ""awww how cute"". I'm still a total noob but this is some of the most fun I've ever had being a noob.

A few tips.

Don't buy any of the packs, there's nothing in them worth the money, with that money you're better off just buying plex and selling it.

Don't log in through steam. Download the client directly from the offcial site and just run it independently.

Find a corp sooner than later.

The game is difficult to learn and even more difficult to master. There is little to no hand holding. I find this is where the community around this game shines. You can find many resources to help you on the internet. The players are very helpful as well with hints and suggesttions to help you out. The game is very social and gives you plenty of opportunity to interact with other players.

The only negitive I have with the game is it is very time consuming witch can be frustrating as casual player. In order to achieve the greater experience, you really have to put in more hours into it. It can seem like a second job. That is not to say you can't have fun and jusy play for short amounts of time.

My Pros;
- A strong community that is less toxic, and more mature. (Usually) Average age here is much, much higher than most games, and most of the time the reviews I see online and in person are from a) people who want instant gratification in their games, which usually leans towards the younger spectrum of players who don't end up enjoying EvE. (I didn't until I was older and tried several times.)
- A sense of danger at all times. 
- Not pay to win. (Not sure how some people think this.)
- Alpha is free to play, but there are limits due to how fragile the game is as it is a free market. CCP employes five full-time Economists on its staff.
- Something no other game has been able to do well, and has been around for well over a decade to boot.
- Space and how beautiful it is. 
- Every person can make an impact. Grouping up feels amazing when you acomplish something.
- Real politics and war.
- One server. That's it. No ""Hey, what server do you play on?""

My cons;
- First starting, this can be pretty daunting. Join up with a newbie corp. Or do what I did; read the wiki everytime you're in the bathroom sitting on the toilet. That's how I learned fast.
- First starting, you have to train a lot of skills needed, and you can't do a whole lot right away. You have, HAVE to specilize in something early to start making isk.  While it seems tempting to try and crosstrain four careers or more at once, it can feel hectic. In a month, you can get really good at one thing, then focus on the other. It'll take you that long just to sorta learn that career.

Overall;
This is the most unique experiences. The emotions that run from this are unlike any other and bleed into your personal feelings in an amazing way. The people you meet, the stories that you are a part of, they're all there.

It's not for everyone, and it's hard to get into for some (took me four times before I found a corp/alliance that I never wanted to leave), the feeling you get from EvE is unlike anything else, and I have tried to find anything close to it, and nothing ever comes close.

Invested almost 190 hrs in the past month and still NOWHERE near where I was back when I first played.

But you see, that is where EVE is most successful. There is always something to learn: New tactics, ships, fits, play styles, careers, etc. There is a reason why CCP has managed to keep this game running since 2003. I decided to get back into the game last month when I noticed it was F2P with restrictions. I just wanted to see if the game can suck the soul from me again. With a few dedicated friends and a new corp, my soul is lost to New Eden once more.

I'm thoroughly enjoying my time in space again. If you want my recommendation? Make friends, ask questions, have some patience, join a corp that shares similar playstyles and goals as you do. If you do this, you will truly enjoy the experience. Never stop learning. Uni-Wiki and veteran players are your best friend.

Everyone plays on the same server, competing for the same resources
Player vs. Player combat is allowed everywhere in the game (though it is punished in certain areas)
The majority of items in the game must be purchased through an in-depth marketplace from players who manufacture them

EVE is also very complex. It is made up of many simple choices which compound on each other. For example:
You want fly a ship into space. Each ship has a number of slots to fit equipment to. Your job is to fit the best equipment on the best ship for the task you'd like to accomplish. Simple right?
Except there are over 200 ships, and over 4,000 items to equip to them. That's a lot to choose from!

People either love these unique concepts or hate the game because of them. 90% of negative reviews are:
""experienced players pick on noobs"" [read: I tried to fight against experienced players solo instead of asking them for help]
""its too hard/boring"" [read: I have a short attention span]
""it costs money"" [read: I don't have a job]

If you're not sure which side you're on, you can play the game for free and find out! Note that the free version of the game is pretty heavily limited though. The idea is that you can take your time to learn the basics of the game before taking out your money to upgrade to a paid account.",1489298053,1489298053,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False
8500,30444277,76561198005406191,0,293,2610,0,2610,1355990400,"Greetings!  As I continue my long journey to review every game in my library I stumbled upon this old MMO that I once cherished.  I’ll start by saying this is hands down, the best MMO out there in term of realism within in the setting, though maybe not the most enjoyable MMO out there for the average user it still maintains much of the charm.  I will say that I did not start this up again, my time on this game was long and enjoyable but I’m not interested in going down that rabbit hole again.

Spreadsheet Simulator:  Everyone has heard this; the game has so many inbuilt features that feel more like a job than a game.  This is true, but needed.  The game has one of the most realistic economies in the entire gaming world and the players take this very seriously.  If you like managing projects, taking financial risks (without the real world implications) or just want to watch an economy crash this game is for you.  If you are playing for the pew pew and to fly spaceships you might want to move on because…

More Simulation less Game:  The game handles more like a simulation, like you are issuing commands to a computer who is piloting your ship and less like you are a pilot.  The game is also brutally difficult even when you remove the other players, death is real, and loss is real.  You can invest in the biggest, meanest ship in the game only to lose it and the months of prep work due to a small mistake.  But the risks taken can provide amazing rewards.

The Progression is real:  The nice thing about this game is that if you go out and buy a ship that someone has been using for years and spent just as long perfecting their skills (both real and in game) they will beat you, the difference is vast but if you take the time and seriously plan out your skill path you can fly with the best in a reasonable time as well.

Do you think this is a game:  With that said, the players of Eve take this game very seriously, during my last stint I was on weekly calls with my corporation completing training exercises and seminars, I was expected to attend and expected to complete certain tasks between now and the next meeting.  At first this was silly, I mean it’s a game right?  But, soon I felt a belonging almost like a member of a crew or a soldier in training.  This is the magic this game provides, if you’ve the time it will devour you.

I think this is an amazing MMO, but if you are just wanting to fly space ships and go on fun approachable missions and gameplay you should move on.  This game doesn’t have a learning curve, not even a cliff it’s a black hole.  But the depths of it are just as endless as they are spectacular.  Every few months I look longingly at this game and think about coming back.  But to this day I’ve stayed away, I’ve one life…don’t need another!  I hope, if you do play you get the full experience that I did.

I'm not even flying my ship with WASD/K+M or having a crosshair to keep the target from trying to evade gun or missile lock. I guess the combat is more from RTS view but one unit where I hope it was more flight sim style cockpit dogfight i,e Star Wars Rogue Squadron.

Mining: Approach, lock-target, fire miner laser, fall asleep/watch youtube/get bored(no minigame, find something to do on google search), watch out for player bandit(what better way than to blow up someone who is not there), haul to station put into hanger, and repeat. 
Would be nice to have a minigame where you can crit a mining or epic fail, instead you get a steady flow base on the equipment stats. Would be funny if they had bandits just grapple cable the ship, connect a hatch to the cargohold, and steal your mining haul without blowing the ship up with a note that reads ""you been hit by a smooth criminal"".

Exploration: Load probe, fire probe, open scan interface, play 3D planes games(X,Y,Z) with cones trying to get the signature to 100%(time varies from 5minutes to 30minutes), go to site or jump wormhole, play 3D scan again, hack site(minigame) or mine(depending on site), get lost trying to get out, play 3D scan again to find exit, and chance to find a gate camper waiting to blast you trying to get home.

I have been reading many many reviews on this page. And sadly I feel especially about the negative ones that they still misrepresent what it is actually about. 

Let me start of by saying. This is a good game but its not for everyone. Maybe saying its a game might actually misrepresent it. Maybe this should be categorised as a ""HOBBY"". Its not a game you can learn in a minute and play it for a few weeks and then toss it away because you finished it.

My game time numbers are not accurate. I only made it go up this far so I could finally write a review about a game which has been inducted into a museum as the largest living sience fiction artwork in the world.
To be precise I have no clue how many hours I have played this game but in the multi thousands over the past 8 years.

So what can you expect of eve? 
- Simple a game so complex that CCP (the developers) have hired people with PHD's in some of the most complex fields in the world to oversee certain sections of the game. Like one of the most popular former developer CCP_DrEyjoG otherwise known as Doctor Eyj­ólf­ur Guðmunds­son. He led a entire team of economists to help monitor eve onlines ingame economy.
- A game where you can become whatever you want if you put in enough effort and willpower.
- A game that can give you life long gaming friends. 
- a game where the developers try to be as uninvolved as possible. Meaning almsot everything goes. But CCP will only step in if certain boundries are broken.
- a game where you can be part of the largest battle in gaming history ( This comes with a side not these generally only happen once a year sometimes only once every 2 years. 

What negatives will you get?

- immensly steep learning curve. ( BUT with the Hire of CCP ghost Also a Doctor btw. They are trying to create a New Player experience that will teach you all the basics propperly. This after more then a decade of a lackluster new player experience that caused many players to never get through it.) I count this as both a positive and a negative.
- A game where every loss matters. Meaning that if you lose your ship its permanently LOST. 
- A game where people will scam you. 

What I am trying to say is, I guess this game is like nothing out there. If you find the right people to fly with you will always keep playing it on some level or another. If not you will probably dispise it for some reason or another. But if you give it a real shot and you go in with a open mind and willingness to learn and to be part of some awesome stories created by your fellow players. You will come to love the game

For everyone who would wanna try it feel free to contact me. Ill help anyone who is willing to put time into this game. Or Ill answer every question you can come up with. 

I own every ship in game up to even the most expensive and powerfull ship class in game. So enough experience to share. 

So if you are hesitant about the game feel free to contact me ask questions. And I hope I can convince to join us.

[b]Who should spend time playing this? [/b]
[List]
[*]If you long for a deep time consuming Sandbox MMO.
[*] If you enjoy PvP and Group PvP gameplay primarily.
[/list]
[b]How much Money Should I spend? [/b]
[List]
[*]$15 Per Month
[/list]
[b]What’s it about? [/b]
[List]
[*]You are a pilot fighting for money and power in a stunningly expansive universe with thousands of players and factions in constant conflict. 
[*]This is a very open-ended MMO where the end goal is not clearly defined. 
[*]You’ll need to make up your own goals and determine how you want to play and what you want to spend your time focusing on.
[/list]
[b]What is the Gameplay? [/b]
[List]
[*] Ship customization is a major component of Eve online, there are thousands of different modules, hundreds of ships, and countless hours’ worth of theory crafting available.
[*] The game is primarily point and click ship movement, managing weapons and other modules properly, and using in game knowledge to outsmart your opponents using basic and complex game mechanics.
[*] There are plenty of avenues to venture into: Mining, Pirating, Salvaging, PvP, PvE….the list goes on.
[*] Unlike most MMO’s you have to pick a path determining how you would like to play the game, there is very little hand holding here.
[/list]
[b]Graphics/Visuals [/b]
[List]
[*] Gorgeous planets, ships, stations and warp effects. 
[*] Fantastically detailed moons, ship turrets, and numerous other small details.
[*] One of the best and deepest character creators I have ever used, which is particularly staggering considering most time in game is spent outside of a spaceship.
[/list]
[b]Sound/Music [/b]
[List]
[*] Music is very good, one of the few MMO’s I have played with the music ON. It complements the battle scenarios nicely and is both futuristic and, perhaps inadvertently, melancholy.
[*] Sounds effects are pristine though most aren’t observable until the camera is zoomed in.
[*] The sounds of humming spaceships, crackling hulls, and zapping laser pulses set the scene magnificently.
[*] Very little voiced dialogue, the vast majority of content is delivered by text blocks.
[/list]
[b]What does it compare to? [/b]
[List]
[*]Elite Dangerous
[*]Star Citizen (At least once it’s finished)
[*]Arch Age, Primarily for the gameplay openness and PvP focus not for the theme.
[/list]
[b]Achievements [/b]
[List]
[*]No Steam Achievements
 [/list]
[b]What are my overall thoughts? [/b]
[List]
[*]A fantastic open-ended sandbox MMO where you really can choose how to play. 
[*]It runs incredibly well, looks fantastic, and has all the well-tuned and refined details of any AAA game and MMO from any other company. 
[*]Fantastic PvP gameplay though the community is a mixed bag, there are some great beginner friendly groups and players as well as an assortment of elitist, snobbish, and rude idiots. 
[*]The PvE is very good though up to point you are, in a broad sense, going to have to group up to do advanced later game content. It is basically impossible to solo certain missions and areas and there isn’t really “End Game” with a hierarchical structure.
[*]This game is well worth your time and money to try out. It is F2P now so there is no reason not to give it a chance. I certainly think it was worth $15 per month when I was playing and surely still is today.

Now that's out of the way I'll keep it short. There are 3 main things you have to do to play Eve and have fun:

- You will have to invest time. This game has a tremendous learning curve. It is much much MUCH higher than most other MMOs. It is a completely player driven world with its own rules, own history, own professions, own market, own culture, own geography and own community. You will need to learn lots of new shit. You will have to commit time.

-You will have to invest money. Eve do not have microtransactions but you will need to sub. Alpha state (free to play state) is ridiculously restrictive and only good for introducing people to the game. You can't stay in alpha and have fun forever. You may be able to pay your sub with in-game money someday but it will not happen soon. You will have to sub to play it properly.

-You will have to interact with people. Eve is a sanbox game, completely different from theme park MMOs where someone is always telling you what to do and where to go next. It is player-driven world, military alliances, commercial corporations, production, market, exploration, building/destroying; everything is handled by players. You will have to interact with people, join corporations, participate in market pvp, avoid scams, join organizations etc. to have fun. Playing Eve solo is usually not rewarding and gets boring fast. You will have to communicate with people.

If you acknowledge these three points and still want to experience the biggest player-driven virtual world the gaming has ever seen, you should give it a chance. There is no game near the scale of Eve online out there. No game offers such strategy, organization and cooperation where thousands of players get together for common goals and shape the game world. Take into account the points above so that you can keep your insults to the game for yourself in case you don't like it and move on to other games more suitable for you.

Also, don't fly what you can't afford to lose.

When you start the game, all the new skills, weapons, ship items, and other gear is so heavily nerfed, I just don't see how it's logically conceivable that even a good newb player would consider chancing a fight with a seasoned player. Sure I understand that it's part of the game to use your ships for battle, but it's the main focus of the game, and shouldn't hinder new players from wanting to explore it more, and learn how to become better. The game just seems like it lends itself to anarchy, and I really don't enjoy that at all. If I want to deal with aggressive personalities I get enough of that IRL.

Skill system is bit off, real time skill queue is, in my opinion, bit off, cause it gives huge advantage to older players. For example to train for Tier 2 ships or marauders takes insane amount of time, about 2 months to fly and another 2 to fit it properly. Few skills can take up to 60 days in queue. To bring new players SP system should be changed, but also keep the advantage for older players, because of the dedication and time they have put in. I have around 5 million skill points which is around 4-5 months of gameplay.
PvP, PvE: pvp system is fantastic yet very lethal if you don't know what you are doing, good pvp fits takes months to train yet it's fun in its own way. I have run few wormhole ganks and gatecamps in low sec and null sec so unfortunately I don't have enough experience running pvp fleets.

If your idea of fun is watching paint dry, you'll love this game.  Of my time in Eve, I'd say 300 of my 475 hours is travel time.

Don't bother playing this. There is a game mechanic where alliances specifically target new corps (guilds) in ""high security"" (SUPPOSED to be safe) space. These groups of people exist for no other reason to grief as many people as possible.

I'm not talking a few gankers here and there. I'm talking multiple massive fleets of players that take great joy in killing everyone trying to get to the major trading hubs.

The game is moderatly fun, if you enjoying TONS of waiting, but the community is the worst of the worst bottom feeders. Griefers have ran everyone else off. Even with the new steam F2P mode, the griefers outnumber the non-griefers 10 to 1, they fight over who gets to destroy that starter frigate or mining vessel first.  And I've noticed a massive decrease in player population starting around Jan 17th or so.

It's call ""War Dec"" (Declaring war allows them to gank anyone in your corp/alliance at will right in front of the ""cops"" face.) And they specifically target guilds that are PvE only.

However, I've had Eve for only 6 months and already have 300+ hours on the game. Me myself I have my own whole huge story with many events that led to it. I am addicted, and here's why. (This is my first ever review so please be nice thank you! :)
Graphics:
I have a gaming PC and on best settings, it runs smooth 60. I have never experienced the game lagging and I have a GTX 770. The game looks beautiful. 
Starting Up:
 You can change every aspect of your characters' body. From toe length to jawline, you can move it all around, not only that, you can also choose how muscular you want your character to be and also his/her weight and much, much more.
The Game Itself:
Let's be straight forward. If you love a complicated game, this is for you. The amount of things you have to think of, all the things you need to do, how you slowly need to grow over time. This isn't a game where you leave it open and it does the work for you overnight, no, you need to work your way from a rookie ship, all the way to the biggest and baddest ship in the game. It sounds easy...but it's nowhere near it. Eve has it ALL. You can move things around, fight, mine, sell, create. So many different things. 
Now the market on Eve is 100% a player made and controlled market. Anything and everything you find on sale were made by a player. Prices go up and down depending on demand. YOU MAKE THE SHIPS!! It won't be there for you, you need to make it! That is THE ONLY WAY you will be able to sell/buy/craft a ship.
Now regardless of that, there are hundreds of weapons in the game. You can't just simply buy these weapons and put them onto your ship. Each ship gives a special bonus to a type of item, mainly guns but other things too. You'll have to train skills. Yes, these skills can sometimes take days to finish, but when you finish them, you will get a very powerful ship, with an AMAZING community to teach you how to use it. 
A game where war with others has POLITICS and all the smallest phrases one says can change the whole outcome of a friendship. Look at the fountain war for example.
And finally, the thing I love most...there are no restrictions. You can betray crops, spy on them, backstab them, there is no limitation to what you can and cannot do. If you have the power/skill to do it, then you can do it and no one will stop you, unless of course, they're much stronger than you. Most of the times, backstabbing doesn't happen because you'll get killed instantly but with the right plan, you can pull it off. It's crazy how it works but there is NO LIMITATION TO WHAT YOU CAN DO. I love nothing more in a game than that.

(Lest you think I'm exaggerating, EVE went into Beta in 2003, and some members of my Corporation have been around since before the game went live).

I won't repeat what others have said about the expansive universe, bruising large-scale PVP environment, emergent economy, and player-driven content. I'll just leave you with my ""big picture"" impression from so many hours in New Eden: EVE is a game of moments. I've hunted war targets in a fleet of 70 cruisers and destroyers. I've gotten lost so deep in wormhole space that I didn't know which way was up. Once, passing through a silent system on the fringes of high-security space, I passed a convoy of four freighters packing up and moving all the resources of an industrial corporation somewhere else. I spent a month in exile, living alone in a derelict Citadel long-since abandoned by the player who built it, while I mined and spent hours in research and industry. EVE truly is a game in which nearly anything is possible.

I avoid making specific recommendations, since I don't know anyone else's preferences, but I hope this review encapsulates some of what makes this game so magical for me. Considering the new (and well-done) free-to-play model, it is worth investing a few hours or a few hundred hours.",1485531817,1485531817,True,1,0,0.506178796291351318,1,True,False,False

After sitting down, and really getting to know this game I've fallen in love. The game is incredibly overwhelming at first.

Anyone who gives this game a bad review isa cookie cutter mmo player. This game is a challenge. Its about setting goals and finding your place in the massive real world that is eve. It takes time to even begin to understand this game, you HAVE to talk to and interact with other players which any mmo gamer from games like EQ, SWG, and even vanilla wow will appreciate the community in this game. I personally am always worried about in game interaction going horribly wrong, but the community really accepts all and is very willing to teach.

this game is for hardcore players, this game for those who feel a need to work for a goal, and not just grind their way to the top.

You train skills over real time in a queue(so you don't have to be logged in to be training) that is time dependant on your character stats.. It's for those that enjoy a higher learning curve, as very little is straight forward and there is so much to learn and pretty expansive. They do ok with getting you started and teaching you how to start making your first money through missions, that themselves mean nothing and you will get repeats. The higher level the difficulty the better the rewards(money, reputation and Loyalty Points) and harder the difficulty. But beyond that a lot is up for you to discover or research. It is a pretty massive ever expanding sandbox universe, with a lot of micro management things you can get into, to keep busy or zone out to straight farming or mission grinding while waiting for skills to complete to unpgrade whatever your into. End game you'll probably want to be aiming for your skills to set you up for a job you like best in the universe. Either being a fighter, farmer(such as miner, salvager or ruin hunter) a commander for an allaince, a builder, an explorer(probing and scanning, finding wormholes, good resource spots and part of the universe, a transporter, a pirate, a bounty hunter (hunting those ganking pirates as you can place bounties on other players that will build and there is also the most wanted in the universe with of course the highest payout). Play how you love to. Build simple planet mining setups to star bases and huge mining colonies or citadel for your allaince and own your part of the galaxy you may have to fight for to defend or go on conquest and take down a nearby enemy corporation/allaince, in day long battles of epic size for fight and control of a zone. Each zone has a security number with how well guards will protect you, higher being the starting areas, lower being end game free for all, but where the most wealth is with the most resources. Also the graphics themselves are pretty beautiful and incredible.

A manufacturer and dealer of an insurmountable level of munitions and arms...

A PROFITEER - Then EVE is for you. 

You can be anyone in EVE. You can do anything, at any time, for any reason. EVE is an open universe waiting for you to jump in and make a name for yourself. The sheer level of activities on offer is mind boggling. Sure, the FREE TO PLAY isn't really free. Alpha characters, as they are known, are very limited to what they can do. That being said, they can still do almost everything there is to do in EVE, not to mention MAKE A KILLING. If you want more, sure. You can pay. Or, you can buy PLEX with IN GAME money (ISK) and never have to pay your subscription again, since PLEX (Pilot License Extention) can be redeemed for 30 days of game time. 

I love running military missions, killing pirates, mining and running HUGE pirate hunting ops called Incursions. 10-12 hours of incursion running pays for an entire month of game time for me (about 3-4 hours a day, 2-3 days a month). I fly a Rattlesnake battleship equipped with cruise missiles that have the capability of locking a target over 90km away, and travelling a maxium distance of just under 130km. With my microwarpdrive and target painter in hand, a volley of these missiles from several launchers at a time usually means certain death for nearly any but the largest of battleships. And even then, they are not nearly close enough to do anything to me...before it is too late.

Just to wine and cry and shed your tears and tell them your going to kill there mother cause they live off tears and chances are they will target you and make it a point to kill you whenever they see you.

Now for the great part of this game. This game is a true sandbox. You literally can pretty much do anything you want. You want to make characters that specialize in spying and sell the information or rob Corparations blind you can do that. You want to hunt Pirates you can. You want to be a pirate you can. Literally there is almost nothing you can do. You want to build massive capital ships or space stations you can. Almost everything in this game is built by another player. No other game can boast that. 

You should try this game. Its hard. Its brutal. But damn it there is no other game like it.",1483335216,1483335216,True,0,0,0.49857860803604126,1,True,False,False

The game mechanics are byzantine. This is a sim for players who want to get lost in a thriving sandbox that is shaped by the efforts of the player base. Eve is deep, challenging, beautiful, and life-devouring. It continues to stand as the high water mark for sandbox game design's potential for player-driven content, emergent economics, and high stakes PVP warfare on a truly galactic scale. To see why this sandbox is surviving through the devoted investment of time and effort of a cult-like player base, stick with it. Your success depends on forethought and awareness. Lazy and impatient players will suffer. Learn from your failures or you will rage-quit like a child. Patient and adaptive players will carve out niches for themselves and leave their mark on the game world. Whether you are a devoted team player or a con artist sociopath, the social aspects of this game are absolutely key. Join an active nullsec corp. Get on Teamspeak. Veteran pilots tend to love to show rookies how to thrive, and mentorship is the best way through the steep learning curve. If you merely fly solo in High Security space, you'll remain stuck in the shallow end of Eve's potential. This is not a design-and-dump product.

I seldomly revisited this title and this time decided to give all the new updates and reskins a try. This game has not changed at its core but rather has made the ""new player"" experience less daunting and the graphics have been improved immensely. 

I love mining in any game and this one does it well. If you are a miner/resource gatherer you can train specifically into that skill set and get better at doing so. The real fun is going out with a few friends in a fleet and mining in low-sec/null sec and trying to get the hard to harvest resources while watching your buddies blowing up an enemy just meters away. 

That all being said, this game will consume your time but the good thing is you can train skills and craft things while offline so you don't always have to be active. You can simply get on and train up until you have the time to utilize the skills with less hassle. 

I highly recommend this title to anyone that loves space sims/sandboxes with that traditional hardcore MMO feel like Ultima Online.

The game is much like playing a spreadsheet...   And this hasn't changed in the past 13 years the game has been alive, nor is there any indication will it ever be changed in future updates.   


It continues to be a game of Absolute Freedom - you can test your craft at economics playing the market and making a fortune off of buying and selling,   You can working class it - spending your time tediously mining rich resource deposites and throwing it on the market,  Be an industrialist, buying up resources and converting it to the much desired processed goods every one uses, Be an adventurer - hunting down NPCs and gaining powerful loot from doing missions, or be a jerk-wagon - doing illegal and unethical things from cheating people out of what they've worked for to killing them indiscriminantly just because you can. 

But all this freedom comes at the price of being tragically overwhelming... you are barraged with so much information that hammering down stuff that is relevent to what you want to do is both time consuming and confusing. 

The problems are then only compounded with the amount of Loss players can potentially experience - with all your hard work getting a specific ship, outfitting it the right way, and filling it with precious cargo... only to have it all erased on a whim when something kills you.


In the end - there is Nothing quiet like the experience of Eve Online - it is an epic space journey which allows you to do almost anything you want.   It will give you exciting moments of joy and crushing moments of sorrow, all in a world where your choices can resonate and potentially alter the entire game universe...

You could call it a ""space MMO"", but lumping it in with other MMO's is a disservice, quite frankly. What makes me say this?

Well, lets start off like this: Space is big. Huge. Mindbogglingly vast. You have all of this entire star cluster (and a second one) to explore. Conquer. Do whatever you want, literally; you can build stuff, blow stuff up, explore, scam, trade on markets, heck, make a T-Rex your mascot and go around spamming memes if you want.

Market PVP? Check. Industrial PVP? Check. Good old-fashioned ship-to-ship combat using missiles, lasers, antimatter blasters, and artillery cannons? CHECK!!!

And the fact that it's all single shard means that whatever you do affects everyone. None of that instanced BS in parallel realms that you find with other MMO's - If you go out and blow up someone's space station, you could legitimately throw the balance of power off between the ingame player coalitions in that region, if not on a larger scale. The story is entirely player-driven, and you can interfere with developer-driven-events if you so choose - for example, the leader of one of the NPC Empires was chosen by a player tournament, and at the ceremony, other players were noted for their support/opposition of the proceedings, and all of this is now official lore.

And, of course, the hundreds upon hundreds of possible ships. You like fast small ships with missiles that fly like X-Wings? Check. Big lumbering battleships that tank for days, and have slow-tracking turrets that will obliterate something when they hit? Check. Something in-between? Guaranteed it's there.

The F2P model does lock out capital ships, and advanced hulls (cloaky ships, interdictors, covert ops). But having played with a restricted character as well, I can safely say that you don't really need those either, as the meta is currently focused around cruisers and destroyers (read: fast kitey doctrines), and generally trends towards making the most out of the least expensive possible hulls. There are exceptions, but those are used by niche groups that don't generally take on newbies.

Recommendation: Play it. It's free to try out(!!!), you can do 95% of the ingame content as a free player, and once you get the hang of it, upgrade to a subscription if you want to try those 5% things! The game can be quite unforgiving of mistakes, and is a very tough nut compared to most other games, but I can safely say it's worth the time, and likely one of the easiest games to get sucked into if you have a love of science fiction.",1480387852,1481128428,True,2,0,0.497857868671417236,2,True,False,False

Because it has many reviews, good and bad about the game, here my two cents:

[list]
   [*] The game have a huge learning curve, also you take a long time to be proficient in an area of the game. Comparing with my experience in Aion, Lineage, World of Craft, and so on, the EVE give me a impression that you take more time to be good in a specific area of game than compared with other MMO.
   [*] For me the game have a base of more old players than other MMO, what this meaning:
   [list]
      [*] more mature players
      [*] players doing things clever to make your day worse, like bumping if you like mining ([url=http://www.minerbumping.com/]Miner Bumping[/url]) or scam you ([url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/41vjr4/do_people_really_fall_for_scams_ooh_yes_details/]Do People Really Fall for Scams Ooh Yes Details[/url])
      [*] players that take too serious
      [*] history and friendships that can make your day
   [/list]
[/list]

[b]Alpha/Omega[/b]

Right now the EVE have alpha and omega clones, someones don't like the limitation of the alpha clones, but the list of skills and options that you can do with an aplha clone is really good. Players use the set of itens listed in the alpha most part of time, if you think in play the game, the alpha clone give you a good range of options to play the game.

- Independent & Motivated.
- Goal Oriented.
- Outgoing & social / Enjoys playing MMOs with other folks on a daily basis.
- PVP minded and does not fear permanently loss of ""items / gear"".
- Strategic minded / prefer RTS or Strategy type gameplay.

You will likely not enjoy this game if you are:
- A Loner who prefer keeping to yourself even in MMOs all the time.
- Passive mindset and seeks the game to prompt you on what to do next.
- Risk averse (afraid of getting ganked and losing stuff).
- Too serious and takes every smacktalk in local or lossmail personally.
- Action oriented gamer who prefer twitch/reflex gameplay. 

About this game:
-EVE is really boring when played solo without social groups. Please join a good player corporation ASAP!
-Graphics are pretty but you may be forced to turn down settings to increase performance in large fleet battles.
-Combat is not exactly ""action packed"". Excitement is there in the form of adrenline pumping when you are hunting or being hunted by other players, not when you are doing the usual ""Approach, Orbit, Shoot"" combat system.
-Player communities are awesome with dank memes and propaganda during wars.
-Dying in the first few minutes of fleet combat can be a very sucky experience as you now have to reship and rush back to the fleet alone while avoiding opportunist hostiles waiting along your return route to gank you. 
-Making isk is quite a boring chore, if you are a new player you may want to buy PLEX instead.
-Developer is known for introducing new features and leaving them unfinished to chase after the next shiny idea.
-CCP support is still very bad at responding to your tickets in a timely manner. Tickets that go unresponded for weeks is still common BUT they are usually very good at compensating you for the wait. (i.e. Poor response speed but excellent support)

Its not for children.
Its not for people who dont want to learn and research a game.
Eve Online is special.

With elements of space simulation you command a ship rather than ""flying"" it.

Eve Online has alot of freedom. The freedom to shoot and get shot, to scam and get scammed, to trade and to make a fortune, to explore and to find something amazing.

Like no other game Eve Online thrives on player generated content.
This can not be understated. The sandbox that is Eve is full of Blood and Glory, full of storys and grief.

My Thoughts:
Many RPGs claim that they allow players to play how they want and make the game a ""truey unique"" experience, EVE Online is the first that I have played to actually deliver this idea. Over the course of the game's history, players have made fortunes and lost much more playing roles that are not strictly defined by the game itself yet nonetheless valid. Large scale warfare has taken place between enormous, player-created corporations (which might as well be nation states) providing an experience that drowns you not only in combat but  intergalactic politics as well. There is no correct way to play EVE Online, as EVE Online at its core simply provides you, the player, with setting and tools needed to create your own, everchanging, actually unique experience. Should players stick around long enough to overcome the steep learning curve, there is an addiction to be found in this game that allows you to win and lose everything.

What I don't Like:
-It is unfortunate that such a marvelous game would have such an unintuitive user interface. Even one of the more simple features, the camera, controls in such a manner that it can be called clumsy at best.
-While the developers are working to improve a new player's first experience, the tutorials meant to teach you the basics do little to cover basic menus and features that need to be understood in order to play the game in any reasonable manner.",1480284539,1480284539,True,2,0,0.523665845394134521,0,True,False,False

[b]Impressions:[/b]
EVE is a game I have watched from afar for a long time and have had great interest and curiousity about.  With the Ascension update and F2P access now available, I thought I would check it out.

I purchased the Core Starter Pack on sale.  As far as the value is concerned, it was a very worthwhile buy.  If you are sure to commit to EVE, I would recommend this.

But this only provides 1 month of ""Omega"" status (subscription/PLEX-paid level access), after which you must fully commit or be bumped down to ""Alpha"" status (F2P).  After examining the restrictions of F2P players, I cannot imagine even attempting to play EVE as Alpha status.  Therefore, you must be willing to commit to Omega status to access an enjoyable experience.  Note, however, that this does not guarantee an enjoyable experience; it is not ""pay-to-win"", as such.

When playing the game the first thing I noticed was the absolutely beautiful graphics coupled with the awe-inspiring scope of the world.  This gave me a sort of euphoria at the presentation and possibility of exploring the vastness of space.  

Unfortunately, this feeling quickly wore off as I attempted to delve into the deep heart of the game.  This heart is resource management.

Much of the game feels like an ERP and logistics system.  Character development, combat preparation and inustrial endeavors all have the feel of managing your resources.  Expect much statistical analysis and logistical consideration in your experience playing EVE.

This is especialy true as you begin to understand the free market nature of the economy and the huge importance of managing your resources well in order to succeed in a player driven universe.

PvE is largely lacking and what there is presents minimally.  Most missions tend toward repetitiveness; PvE is not EVE's strength.

That said, the world of EVE is surely full of possibility; just that it is not accessible to the new player.  To access the many possibilities of EVE, a player must spend a very large amount of time to accumulate the resources necessary and a further amount of time cultivating his place in the cummunity.

This is not necessarily a bad thing, but this inaccessibility means that your initial ROI (return on investment), for both time and cost, is low.  On the other hand, if you are looking for an alternate reality and social experience, EVE is likely to provide exactly this.

Ultimately, I can't recommend EVE because of the many difficulties the new player will need to overcome to developing an enjoyable experience; not the least of which is the massive amount of time and absolute commitment that EVE demands.",1480213890,1480213890,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

It's not a game. Not in the normal sense of the word at least. There are no objectives that it points you towards, no obvious progression, no fail state or even a way to play it ""right"".

It's just a sci-fi simulation of a galaxy. And it's just there.

What makes it, and the reason why it's been going on for 13 years, are the players. Everything is run by players. Everything is made by players. From the smallest bullet to the biggest conflict in gaming history.
And when every single interaction is human, there are no limits on what can happen. You've probably seen the articles around the web - huge wars involving thousands of players, heists and backstabs carefully prepared over the course of years, revenge stories and so much history that you could fill dozens of books. Nothing is scripted or meant to happen.

EvE is not a game. It's an experience, an alternate universe that lives on its own; you're simply trying to make an impact on it and create your own goals.

But if you want to try it, remember: at the heart of it, EvE is about social connections. Alone, you're nothing. You won't go too far if you try to be a lone wolf.

Surviving and thriving in EvE is an intelligence game, if you mess up and make a mistake then there are thousands of players that immidiately will try to take advantage of it. And the same goes for yourself as a player, your goal is to take advantage of other players in the game for profit and that does invlolves more than just ship combat. EvE is a beautiful but harsh universe, it is unforgiving and unfair, it is filled with tears of the weak, danger always will await you in space. 
 
If you are cool with all that and are up for the challenge then you should really try the game out. You might love it too!

I care about kills because I'm PvP oriented and I like green entries on my Killboard - maybe totally lame for a high-margin market trader or some sneaky explorer etc. Losing a ship in the early stages can be painful, you just spent maybe half your fortune on that thing. But here is the thing - maybe it was your own fault. You start in High-Security Systems in which you are kind of protected against random agressions (if you buy PLEX and sell those to get a lot of ingame currency and then buy really expensive stuff and put it in your cargo you have a huge Target on your back - don't do that), but if you go into low-sec or null-sec (or spooky spooky wormholes), people will engage you and murder you if you are not associated with them - chances are pretty slim that somebody lets you walk - what might happen is that people see that you are new and send you some money after they killed your ship and your capsule.

EvE is hard and there can be many reasons why you might quit early on. Frustration because of missing knowledge or boredom because you hang out in your Beginners-Mining Ship (Venture) and hack away at an Asteroid for a laughable reward. While frustration and boredom might be initial reasons to quit (among other things) these factors can be a constant threat to your enjoyment of the game. But here is the thing - you can decide how you play this game and how you want to spent your time. PvP, doing Missions for Agents, Mining, Building, Trading, Exploring etc.

Are you artistic and like doing things in GIMP or Photoshop? Create an interesting/funny/serious poster for your Corp or Alliance and receive ISK for it. You are an IT-Guy/Gal who can set up Stuff for your Corp/Alliance - expect ISK raining down from the heavens. Eve extends vastly over the Game itself, more than maybe any other Game. 

If you are new to Eve here are some Guidelines:

- The start is not user friendly and it can be overwhelming (I wanted to punch my screen when I started and I was supposed to scan something). It fucking sucks, but hang in there.
- Don't trust anyone, but also join a Corp, built relationships, think ahead while interacting. If something is free or too good to be true it's most likely a scam. Ask in-Game for help - also EvE University, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet etc. are a few of the big Beginner-friendly Alliances, which are also involved in big fights. But don't overlook smaller Corporations or Alliances, there might be a perfect one for you out there. Additionally Corps, Alliances or single Persons can be pretty toxic, if something is not for you leave and search for greener pastures - because some people are fucking awful (not League of Legends awful, but still).
- Don't fly around in Ships you can't replace / Don't buy Items with real world Money and fly them around (Plex and Skillinjectors is a nono in the cargohold - exceptions may apply here).
- You are ""safe"" nowhere, but outside of High-Sec (read it up) you are freely engageable.
- Play EvE if you have the time and you want vast and slightly complicated - if you don't want a doughnut but go to the bakery to get a doughnut and write then a bad yelp review for the bakery you are just the worst kind of person.
- Reviews and the enforcement of an opinionated culture are a platonic nightmare... We are all doomed. ♥ ♥ ♥",1471623264,1480034389,True,6,0,0.558849453926086426,0,True,False,False

Advice:
-May sound intuitive, but the longer you play - the better it becomes and the more likely you are to enjoy.
-Convince some friends to join you on a trial/free account or link up with a corporation.
-Ask questions, read the help chat channels and learn from your mistakes.

Review Information
For clarity, I started playing end of 2006, so I have a fair amount of years played. The important points are:
-Single shard universe. (One server)
-Almost a fully player driven economy. (With a couple of exceptions)
-Player driven content. (Transport/hauling for players, player ran bank that offers interest, mercenary/protection contracts - to name a few)
-Real consequences for loss and opportunity for gain.
-Line between PvE and PvP is blurred and the balance shifts depending on where you are. You exist in a world where either is possible at all times, but there are inherently safer and more dangerous areas.
-Single platform for development and commitment to it - EVE Online began around 2003 has been in constant development ever since. Infrastructure, graphics and game features/content iterated on and expanded continually.
-Excellent communication between developers and community/players. (Dev Blogs, Fanfest, strong presence in-game and on forums, Player Council elected by players.)
-Soundtrack, atmosphere and world building really adds to the overall experience.

I'm interested to see where EVE Online will go in the future. I hope they continue to focus their efforts on developing a singular product and reap the rewards (for both player and company) of all the benefits that come with doing so.

EVE Online, so much to say about it, so much to do once you pass the steep learning curve. A sandbox space mmo, 13 years in the making, still evolving and very time demanding. But so rewarding in the end.

You will be amazed, you will fear, cry, be proud, be merciful and merciless, be an opportunist, be a savior, a destroyer, you will be something and feel so many emotions that games don't usualy put you through.

The hardest thing is maybe choosing a path, crafting your style. Create or join fleets and corporation, be a rivals, allies, just be and do what you please: raid and destroy/pillage others or follow the rules of your empire and corporations. 

Explore, Trade, Fight anyone (factions, corporations, random players) and for anyone, Haul, Build, Mine or even spin your ship if you want to ! 
Do as you want and specialise in what you want, do something and excel in it, or do multiple things and be average in them, you will have to choose or you will have to invest time. 
Time is the only way you gain experience and get skilled. You will play for years and still learn, you may think you know it all but you'll still be amazed at how much you still don't.
Talk, study, discover and learn the game, explore the game at your own pace.

Bigger is NOT Better in EVE Online, every ship and class has it's role and it's variations, any ship is useful in a way, the combat system is full of details, of counters, learning how to fight will take some time but when you grasp it it's probably the best tense pvp you will ever have, it's brutal, it's cunning, it's rewarding and punishing. Don't fly what you cannot afford to lose, keep that in mind.

I could talk about EVE for hours and hours without telling you everything there is to it. 
EVE Online is a game you always go back to in the end. Play it for a few months, a year, then stop and come back later.
You'll learn some more and follow new paths you didn't even suspected the last time you played.

And now EVE is free, limited but subscription-free if you want to have a look, just get in, love it or hate it, EVE is not for everyone, but if you like sci-fi, complexity and always discovering something new and learning, then it may be the game you always looked for.

I will say that this game is not for everyone. If you are turned off by subscription based MMO's then you may want to look elsewhere.

Right now EVE Online went free to play with the Alpha clones so totally worth trying out without a time limit for a trial.

There is so much to do in EVE, so if you get board with one thing, move onto the next. Visuals and effects are very nice looking. Warning to new players, the learning curve can be high. If you do not buddy up or find a corp can go solo, you can find yourself taking a long time to figure things out.

Most people will be repulsed by combat system which many call ""simple"" or ""spreadsheets in space"", but believe it or not it's one of the most complex and adrenaline fueled combat system in any MMO (talking about PvP), where when you loose, it has consequences much larger that having to run for your corpse from nearest graveyard.

In most MMO's you pick your class and all that stuff and then you grind yourself to top level along the path that everyone has to take, only to arrive at max. level, grind your gear and wait for next expansion, while meanwhile leveling your alts, in EVE you literally can take any path you want, from mining and production to running missions and incursions, from flying in a small gang pvp to large scale battles that gaming websites around the world then write about. And since all this is fueled by imagination and interaction between players, you have literally endless things to do without the need to wait for authors to release new content. 

The other big factor that many have heard about, is the option to pay for your game time with ingame currency. It combines all the good stuff from classic subscription based models with the ability to play for free without the annoying stuff from F2P titles. At first the price for one month in the ingame currency might seem high, but give the game a few months and whatever path you choose you will be able to play for free without a lot of effort, or pay for multiple accounts.",1292699014,1479925987,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
8500,24714021,76561197980977995,205,22,51163,0,50091,1585866337,"EVE Online is a space MMORPG set 20.000 years in the future, with a great background story and considerable ammount of science-fiction content, even some unique features in the genre like character immortality through use of mind transfers between clones, use of advanced cybernetics and man/machine interfaces. 

It uses a passive character progression system that lets users accumulate skill points over time while their subscription is active, the ammount of points collected in the various categories will determine how effectively a character will be allowed to perform any of the multiple in-game professions. Players can extend their subscriptions with their credit cards or with EVE Online timecodes (PLEX), which can be bought and then traded for ISK in the in-game market.

Unlike other space simulators that place the player inside the cockpit of their ship, EVE Online features a tactical combat system, where capsuleers take remote control of their starship and its systems to engage in a variety of activities, from mining to manufacturing, trading, pirating, factional wars and even large scale space sovereignty wars between corporations and alliances. 

The in-game market is mostly run by players who mine, research, manufacture and trade all types of goods available in stations and player owned structures, from ships and modules to weapons, ammunition, fuel, ore, combat boosters, augmentations, among others. 
All sorts of trading scams and other types of conduct that normally would be forbidden in other MMO's like market manipulation, infiltration, espionage, theft and grief, are not only allowed but also encouraged by the developer, who uses the player stories emerging from those events as a marketing tool.

The single shard universe (Tranquility) and large scale battles of up to multiple thousands of players in the same instance are one of the features that make EVE Online unique in the space MMORPG genre, but they are only possible at the cost of 1Hz server ticks, time dilation, reduced graphics and physics quality, among other architectural limitations that make some people opt for other newer and technologically more advanced space MMORPG's on the market.

Throughout it's 13 years of existance, CCP Games has expanded some aspects of the game, the most notable ones probably being sovereignty wars, wormhole space and factional warfare, but has also failed to develop and deploy promised features like Planetary Landings and Walking in Stations. These failures resulted in tremendous community backlash, a couple waves of mass developer lay-offs and millions of dollars down the drain. A pattern present in multiple former CCP Games employees' company reviews https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CCP-Reviews-E159347.htm points to upper management neopotism, employee favoritism regardless of competence and stubburness in constantly trying to reinvent the wheel with miscoded in-house tools instead of using tools with proven value in the industry. A few isolated cases of former developers being threatened to ""have their carreers ruined if they were to reveal the companies' plans to further scam their customers"" were also reported. The original developers who wrote the game have long ago departed, and the care-taking janitors working on it today lack the creativity to innovate. The upper management and CEO's competence is questionable at best.

The company has tried to expand the EVE Universe into platforms other than the PC, namely with the now extinct Dust514 shooter on the PS3. Despite community opposition, CCP Games signed a PS3 exclusivity deal with Sony and scammed its playerbase, as Dust514's development was funded by EVE Online subscribers who were not interested in acquiring an obsolete piece of hardware to play it. Other side projects like EVE Valkyrie and EVE Gunjack have recenlty been spawned, also funded by the main game and money making product EVE Online, in a continued effort to expand the Universe to other platforms and Virtual Reality HMD's. 

Going all out on VR development, the company had as of 2014 invested more than $USD 40 million in VR Research & Development (yearly financial reports used to be available @ https://www.ccpgames.com/company/financial but were recently taken down after CyberChaosCrew brought them to the players' attention). A questionable move considering that VR is at this point an expensive gimmick with questionable future in the gaming industry.

CCP Games has recently and controversially hired various former EA employees for key roles in the company, appointing one of them as Vice President for development, and shortly after a few others for Executive Producer positions in the new projects, namely EVE Valkyrie and Project Legion (now Project Nova). It has since adopted changes to its business model, including cosmetic item monetization and features like the skill point injectors and clone states that give players in-game advantages in exchange for money.

Time will tell if these options will bring the EVE Universe many players and an endless revenue stream that will fund great things to come, but CyberChaosCrew chooses to remain skeptical until further developments and does not recommend people to spend their time/money with EVE Online.",1470342437,1479905868,False,368,18,0.629802465438842773,13,True,False,False

First thing I thought when I started playing eve was, the bigger the ship, the better the ship. Well I quicky bought my way to a Battleship and realized how wrong I was when I couldn't hit anything small and was moving slower than a snail. 

It seems like every ship (or at least family of ships) in this game has a place and something it excels at. 

I started as an Alpha player, and quickly got my PLEX to be an Omega. I have only managed to get to the Trade capital so far, but I have been working with the Security agents and have been having fun doing the high sec content of the game. 

I am recommending this game on the Tutorial alone. I really wish there was more because it was really really good. Voice acting was awesome, and it gave me a basic sense on how to play the game, and what the Universe was about. I wish it continued on into a campaign or something.

There is still so much I haven't experienced in this game, and I am looking forward to my first space tragety!",1479806445,1479806500,True,3,0,0.544867455959320068,0,True,False,False

I dont know why). Well heres a pros/cons list from what i have found.

Pro

 - Large scale fights 
 - Interesting game powered drama stories
 - Modular ship systems (items that can effect almost every aspect of your ship)
 - Deep ship systems (many of the modular items for ships have multiple upgrades and side grades)
 - Large map
 - Tons of jobs/things to do

Cons
 - The community is VERY VERY hostile (Many i have found will jump on you for no reason (thats fine) and then when they fail/succeed in destroying you will start to actively harass you try to aggravate you and finally tell you to GET OUT and stop playing (go play hello kitty).
 - Certain job/types of work in game are actively hated/attacked by the community. Good luck if you like playing PvE or want to be a miner (which results in a TON of con #1)
 - Corps. They are the guilds of other games this normally is a good thing playing with others is great  until they ask for a full 2 to 3 page in game resume and to read your in game mail.
 - Lack if up to date info for game, nothing like looking online and in game for 3 days for a item they removed and not finding any info that it was removed (be prepared to sift through posts and sites for info that is 5 to 7 years old, many dont have time dates good luck)
 - Boredom around 100 of the hours steam said i was playing i was actually asleep most of the time that came from sifting through the ENDLESS number of charts ,graphs, lists, and trying to find proper ship parts.
 - Low sec there is almost no reason to go there as it is (there's very few things there that you cant do everywhere else in hi sec, null sec, wormhole) but many will tell you to go there anyway and when you do you get hunted down (thats fine its a part of the game) which results in con #1 if you tell the people who advised you to go to low you dont want to go there again (as there is no point in doing so) you get a TON of con #1.

EVE is not for everyone. This game has been subbed-based for YEARS. It has an incredible in-game economy and a political system like no other MMO. This game takes A LOT of time and dedication. 
I couldn't get into EVE. It takes too much effort. But if you are interested and you are willing to put that effort and time and dedication into the game, this is the most unique MMO out there. It's an incredible experience and an incredible game. There are many things you can do. Combat, trade, exploration, mining, piracy. You can roll solo or with a small group or with a giant corp and depending on what you do you will have vastly different opportunities and experiences. It's a huge galaxy out there.
Expect to spend months of your time in this absolutely gigantic game. It takes a while to take off.

Played this game for several years (From 2006 to ~ 2012), stopped playing due to a combination of personal time constraints, and the developers seeming inability to fix longstanding issues. 

But my biggest gripe, and the reason I warn anyone who wants to play a game from this developer, is thier abysmal customer support. If something happens and you need to submit a support ticket, expect anywhere from weeks to months for a response,  (and even longer if you have to reply to have the awnser fixed!).

And if your account gets hacked, well tough shit. Best case scenario is that you get your account back within a couple of months, (yes months, and any time you paid for the game during that time is essentially lost), with almost non of your items. (If the hacker sells all your stuff, its gone buddy).

If the hacker does anything to get your account banned, they will return the account to you but not reverse the ban. (And any game time you had on that account is fucked), If they are merciful they will allow you to start over and  create a new character (in a game where skills are time-based, meaning you could lose years! worth of skills), and use the gametime already credited to your account.

If your super unlucky (as I was) the hacker will sell your account/character (which is condoned by the developer). In this case you are fucked, as the developer will just let the hacker/third party keep your account.",1479517100,1479517100,False,16,1,0.525142431259155273,0,True,False,False

You can do absolutly everything, from fighting players, npcs, ganking poor miners, create and sell items on the market, etc.
Every possible carreer path is viable and as everything is player made, you feel like you contribute to this world even to the smallest extent. The incredible complexity is a really good thing too, as it takes a lot of time to master, and it feels so rewarding.

Pros :
-Super deep and complex.
-Many possible career paths (it's a real sandbox).
-No game rules stopping you from anything : you can even do money by scamming players (with ingame items ofc).
-Most of the universe is player driven, most manufactured items are made by players.
-Every aspect of the game needs learning.
-The skill system makes the progression smooth and feels rewarding.
-Universe in constant progressions, politics driven by players.
-Regular updates
-Rookie chat and turorial helps you getting into the game.

Cons :
-Very very long to master, and very complex (some ppl don't like it)
-Time consuming, whether it is in game content or reading wikis to improve.
-Very niche game, will not appeal to anyone
-It takes a very long time to be able to fly larger ships or to be maxed out in any carreer path you may choose.


Overall it's a pretty niche game, but with a huge huge amount of playable content, and everything player driven. If you're really interested don't give up at the beginning and find someone to help you.

Luckly the developer, CCP updates the game regularly and keeps improving the experience.
With the introduction of EVE being free to play (with many restrictions) hopefully this will breath some life into a game where it's become rather stagnant and boring.

   Now the Eve universe will be intimidating once you develope a grasp of what you can do, I have played for roughly 5 months of game time and it still intimidates me a good deal. There are groups of players that can and will 'gank' you. Destroying your ship and stealing your cargo. BUT do not let that turn you off, the longer you play the better you will get at countering/avoiding it. Also dont get mad at gankers, you have to remember that it is an intended playstyle in the game, they are not bad people (well most), and it is how a good portion of the gankers make their money. Remember Eve is a space simulator in its purest form, pirates included. Oh and dont skip the tutorial, there has never been a more important tutorial in any game then the one in Eve Online.

When you start off you will probably try out mining to make ISK (the in game currency), thats what I did. You can easily do this by speaking with a mining agent, I believe they even supply you with a Venture mining frigate, which will be the main ship you use for mining for a long while as it has bonuses to mining efficiency; as well as a huge cargo hold dedicated to ores. If you plan on staying in the mining/industrial route I recommend working towards a mining barge, they mine a lot faster, have larger ore bays, and better durability. Stay in 'High Security' (0.7 or higher) for the first month or until you feel comfortable, pirates new and old absolutely love attacking mining frigates and barges. Even in high security space you are still at risk of suicide gankers. If they deem your ship more valuable destroyed then the ship they are in, they will sacrifice it. 
Heres are a good practices for mining when starting out: 
Always have a default station saved under your waypoints- while mining you should be roughly 2,500m from the asteroid you are mining, try to manuever your ship above or below the asteroid and avoid being any closer then 2,500m from surrounding asteroids. Once you have done this right click, highlight your default station, and select the 'align to' option. Your ship will begin to move towards the station without warping, stop your ship once it has straightened out. What this does is since your ship is already aligned with the station when a hostile npc or ganker warps into your asteroid field when you go to warp to the station it will immediately warp you, speeding up your escape and reducing chances of losing your ship.
   When you go to warp to an asteroid field there is an option when you select it to warp different distances away. I sometimes will warp 100km away from the target to see if it is clear for mining. If it is I will warp back to my default station then warp back to the field using the default 0km warp. This is much faster then actually floating towards the field.
   Also, only use autopilot in high security space in low cost ships. When you warp using autopilot you will arrive a good distance away from your destination, leaving you to float slowly towards it. This. is. bad. Gankers love it when you do this because it gives them ample oppertunity to take what is yours. When you manual warp, by default, it sends you as close as you can get to your destination. Allowing you to instantaneously interact with your destination; docking, or jumping.

There is a saying in Eve: ""Fly Safe, Fly Casual.""
But there is also: ""Isk, rhymes with Risk.""",1477132596,1477132596,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The best way to make isk in this game is to get a part-time RL job (doesn't matter, minimum income will suffice), buy 6 plex a month with half of your new income, manipulate the market, make more money, sustain your sub with your in-game passive income, go to pvp get blown up or not, repeat. You will make more money than %85 percent of the players, and with the gained RL communications skills you will be able to manipulate people ingame for more ISK 
(market speculations, in-game politics etc.). This `game` is the ultimate spreadsheet simulator with clicking minigame added on top. 
Even the developers admitted the game is boring, and some people play it because they like boring stuff. They developed the game this way because when they first started it, they didn't have the man power and resources to make an AAA game, so they told themselves, ""how can we make a game that is not a game, and still make people believe they are playing a space game"" (this is basically what they've said in an old interview about the developement process). 

Most of the game is an illusion, ""space"" images you see are mostly static, you can never see anything change, you can't even observe the orbits of planets, spacestations, stars or any other object. NPC's are non-existent, and when there is less than 20k people are online in the server, game feels barren with nothing to do but do pve ""content"". This spreadsheet has the worst NPC mechanics in any other game. I even dare to say some of the browser games have more pve content than this. If you are looking for a spaceship exploration game with non-gated mechanics, and come home after a long day and chill by playing this, don't even try to play this game. UI is horrible and impossible to explain to the new players, only way to learn the game is by experiencing it and reading about it in forums-wikis. You won't be able to understand the game before you reach at least 20M sp, get blown up a couple times, cry, make people cry by harrasing them, rinse-repeat. And by this mark if you are continuing to play this, only explanation is, you want to take your revenge or build huge spreadsheet empires and never login again and be still playing the game. Do some research and you will see, some of the most succesfull players in this game almost never login, they go on to ts, talk with some same-minded people, talk some more, and logoff from ts3.  This game never seen more than 60k logon at the same time, never seen more than 600k~ subscribers, and most of the subscribers are the alts of the main accounts. Most people can't play this game without 5-6-7 alt accounts for skill training-afk ganking- suicide gankking, and some are willing to pay hundreds of dollars to this game just to be able to play effectively. And this people, mostly never login to their main accounts unless shit goes wrong and their bus drivers are ganked. 

Some people will disagree no matter what critism anyone will bring to their beloved spreadsheet, but research before you decide to put money on this game, or you will eventually like the most players, begin to debate in your mind why you are still playing this shit. And like some players your answer will be, because I played it for so long and I don't want to lose what I have in the game. Its called buyers remorse. You will try to rationilize why you like this game even though you are bored.

And if still you want to play the game, this is not a sandbox, this is a non consensual pvp, drived by the industry of players, gated behind real time skill point training system. If you are not willing to pay hundreds of dollars, you won't be able to fly %85 of the ships in your first year, at least effectively. And if you are willing to pay, as I said before, you will find best way to gain money in game is to get a RL job, and buy Plex's, sell them ingame, and save your self from boring grinding and get to the fun stuff (because you will see, you want to buy skill injectors to cut in to skill training time, some skill training queues can go up to 350 days even to begin to be able to fly some ships, or manifucture some ships effectively.

EVE is truly a massive game, with around 8000 star systems and all players on a single server. Most people who have heard of EVE have probably heard of the massive battles involving thousands of players and destroyed tens of thousands of dollars worth of internet spaceships.

DO NOT JOIN THIS GAME EXPECTING TO TAKE PART IN THESE EVENTS YOUR FIRST FEW MONTHS! You will likely be disapointed. 

First off, massive fleet engagements are few and far between, and when they do happen, they usually slowed down by the games anti-lag mechanic ""Time Dilation"" or TiDi for short. This is where the game will slowdown up to 1/10th its normal speed so that it can calculate everything for everyone at the same time. And massive engagements amount to ""Listening to whoever is in charge of your fleet telling you who to lock, and press F1 to fire your weapons.""

Capital and Supercapital ships in the game, like the Iconic Titans are more trouble than they are worth most of the time. They cost massive amounts of ISK, can take anywhere from three to six months to even fly them, two or more years to use the effectivly. They truly are an End Game to EVE, something you decide to use after you can use most other ships.

Now this isnt to say that PVP in EVE cant be fun, quite the opposite. PVP can be incredibly challenging, yet fun and rewarding. It can also be quite costly as loss is real in EVE. When your ship explodes, it's gone for good. Experince is the best thing you can have in small group, or solo PVP.  there are hundreds of different ships in the game, all requiring different skills to fly, and have different strengths and weaknesses. There are no ""Best Ships"" in the game, they all have their role, and some do it better than others. The Meta in EVE is constantly changing, and what is good one update, may not be in the next one.

Always remember the Golden Rule in EVE: ""Never Fly what you cant afford to lose""

If you dont like the risks involved in PVP, there are several other things you can do in EVE.

Mining is slow, and boring. but is constant and reliable cashflow. The ore you mine can be sold directly or used in Industry to create items and ships. And like most things in the game, it's better in groups, where special ships can boost the yield of your mining ship considerably.

Industry takes time, but can be incredibly lucrative. Almost everything a player uses in EVE, comes from another player. from the small and agile frigates, to the massive Titan class vessels as well as space stations are all built by players who combined raw materials, blueprints and time to build everything.

Exploration has a lot of luck involved, and can take you out deep into hostile space, but you can find ancient data sites with data cores containing valuble information useful for Tech II Blueprint research. Relic Sites containing valuble salvage, Combat sites guarded by pirates which can drop valuble modified modules worth huge amounts of Isk, or nothing at all.

Mission Running is steady, and fairly safe work where you take contracts from an NPC Corporation to complete a certain objective, like killing NPC ships in a certain system. You can collect bounties from these ships, as well as the loot they drop as well as payment for completing the objective. As you do more and more jobs for the same corporation, you can eventually take on tougher contracts worth more money.

There is much, much more in EVE online, and there isnt much stopping you from experincing all of it, only time. EVE is an online game, and everything in the game is better with friends. Find a corporation that suits your playstyle and join them. If you get bored with your playstyle, change it up. doing the same thing day in and day out will make the game boring. 

When the game becomes a second job to you, it's time to change what you're doing, because it means you arent enjoying the game, like a game.

And remember,

-A game so deep, with incredible mechanics that are actually a monument to both capitalism and basic human instincts.
It's a sociology treaty in itself, and would be worth at least a paper on it .
-Market is the most advanced in the whole gaming world.
-Chronophage as hell.....but most of that time can be spent doing something else.
-Frustrating for new players b/cof quantity of informations......But a new tutorial, renewed interface and helpful corporations come to limit the problem without erasing it tho.
-Variety of roles you can play
-Human interactions only limited by our own imagination
-Gameplay could use a bit of dynamism, but in major battles individual skill is merely useless. Teamplay, preparation, and choosing the time and the place for the fight with the right focuses is the essence of PvP.
-Pve fun at higher lvls.
-Plexes 




I think i'll start with a major problem for new players, that has actually scared them to the point of quitting early.
Eve online is a colossal work, with an obliterating waterfall of informations you need to keep in mind.
Either you start keeping notes from the beginning or you're gonna forget about it the third day because you've been swamped by second day plethora of intel.That's actually both awesome and frightning.

About that, the old tutorial honestly did nt help much: It was messy, not always clear, not always informative, and if you did nt read some missions you could lose everything you had.
I'm thinking about a mission that gave you a ship for the very purpose of loosing it to Pve pirates. If you did nt read that you had to change ship for it, you were pretty screwed.
Happened so many times you can t imagine ...Chatting the poor guys to stay was kinda sad.

Since this game allows you to be W/E you wanna be : Pirate PVP, trading expert, industrial expert, mining monster, scout and many others, tutorial needed to cover the basics for the majority of possible roles.
Well, they finally did a decent one now, so scared players can come back to give it a shot because it does what's expected from it. Even interface has been refined a bit, just enough to be noticeable, and it's good news.

A second point worth talking about for newcomers is the community.
About that, Eve community realized they needed new players to keep the game living, and many of them created corporations focused on helping rookies.
Obviously, some of them are less effective and focused than others, but in that case there is one you can't miss :
EvE University. 
They're gigantic, which could mean they can't focus their attention on the single player as much as a smaller one, but you're sure you're gonna get at least the basics, and you'll find someone to talk to at every hour of the day/night.




Now that we've established the game got better for new players, i'd like to keep giving you hints on what's coming for you once you learned the basics.

Research for example, which will be your bread and butter during your whole experience.
Altho the game gives you the opportunity of choosing your race, and background, giving you an idea of what type of ships and weaponry you should use, these choices are not definitive.
Indeed, thanks to the research system, you can decide to play a Caldari character b/c you like their look, while driving Amarr ships and their weaponry because you like lasers and good looking ships only for a small loss of time due to the initial research, and it will be adviseable to change system to amarr in order to have better chances of finding your modules on the market there than Caldari spawn.

But that's just the beginning of it, because research will determine what kind of ships you can drive, and you'll be able to specialize in the role you wanna play. Guides on classes, roles, ships, and research orders are available everywhere.
And the wiki is colossal.

Then , when you've decided what you wanna be in the game, the researches are already going, and you're ready to play the game you'll need to make money to support you.
Doing Pve missions, mining, trading will be your first choices as pirating might need a higher level of research, ships and modules.
But you can actually find other ways, such as being a mule for someone that is hiding for some reason...With a small and low level ship you have less chances to be of any interest for pirates or any other things you can find a way to leverage over a higher lvl player.
The game is only limited by our own imagination in the trading sector.
And if you're a little impatient, you can buy plexes.

Plexes are game time, that you can either use, stock, or sell for what will be a loooooooot of money for a new player, much more than what 15 euros might lead you to think. (in wow 15 euros are worth nothing in comparison).
And when you have to trade those, it can get really dangerous, which is why i mentioned the mule thing earlier.
If you have many plexes to sell or to stock somewhere safe you have either the choice of winging it, risking to lose real money, or to pay for an escort, or to have your own army within the corporation, or....using a very low level ship for more concealment.

If the IG market were nt incredible enough for it's time, plexes and IRL usable money made it perform even better. Stupid prices are limited b/c there is always someone that will sell it for something less, because of the urgency factor, and so many other relevant things such as economies of scale that lead the market to be the best performer in any MMO and game in general.




With all that, you can gleen from the context that eve online looks like an excessively time consuming game.
It is. Chronophage as hell.
Some Researches take days, weeks, and even months to be finished.
Mining you whole cargo capacity takes hours, depending on the quality of the mining module and obviously the volume of your cargo.
But it's meant that way. You can play while researching, even go to sleep or quit playing for a week, and the research will be done even if you re not logged. And it doesnt concern very new players, as the first levels of research are very quick.
As for mining, well, you can go to sleep, i'm not sure about the logging part tho.
But again, as a new player you don't have those mining monsters, and your cargo will be full pretty fast.



And finally i'd like to mention Pve , PVP, and gameplay related review.

As for Pve, many players like it as it is. I personally think of it as a little boring since the gameplay itself is nt very dynamic. But in the highest level i know it gets much harder, and you're swamped even with a honourably slow gameplay.
For all those who were thinking about elite dangerous, or playing eve with a joystick,sorry bros, forget it.
Eve is about activating the right modules at the right time, as energy is consumed, and you have plenty of them, turrets included.
But i guess if you're ok with that kind of gameplay, you're about to discover an incredible game.
I'm pretty sure in chess knights don t neight and towers don t shoot fireballs when you move them.
Yet, its still one of the most advanced games in the world.


PvP is probably the most exciting part of eve online. 
PvPing alone can be fun, but the best part is clearly in group.
Corp vs Corp, pirates vs miners and their escort, destroying economic, industrial, and research stations to weaken enemy's production while you wait for the final blow are actually just little examples in the wide range of tactics and strategies you can employ in the game.
While gameplay could admittedly be funnier, more dynamic, when you participate these encounters, that's just the last thing you think about as you realize individual skill in a major battle will never be enough.

One does ask the question though ""why the hell am I playing this"" while they are waiting for the next mining cycle. Then they quit. I quit and played about 3 or 4 times.

I started playing back in 2009 where I found myself starting out in the PVP side of EVE. From the beggining I found that the learning curve in this game is HUGE. If your going into this game thinking you are not going to be devoting a large majority of your time to this game you are very mistaken. However, if that last point scared you a bit not to worry as the community with in EVE Online make the experience of getting over that HUGE learning curve ; 1. Enjoyable and 2. Alot Easier. 

The one thing I think makes EVE Online one of the best games I have ever played is the fact that after almost 7 years of playing this game (with breaks in between granted) I still come back to this game and I am still learning new things everyday. Another thing is the versitility of the roles available in EVE Online. The main roles available are probably in Industry or PVP/PVE. So if you think that combat is too scary for you or you dont want to dedicate too much time to the game industry would definately be the route for your or possibly exploration. However if you think mining rocks for a majority of your time is too boring then definately go for the PVP route, as believe me from personal experience you will have more than enough fun :).

So if you want to try out the game after this but there is still a element of uncertainty with in you I would recommend going to the EVE Online website and getting a trial first, and then if you like it upgrade to the full game.

First of all, it's a sandbox game so do not expect to have a clear purpose in your EVE-life. There are so many different careers you can choose from that you won't ever fully explore and know them all. It could take anything from months to years to fully understand and master every aspect of the game (and I'd be happy to laugh at anyone claiming that). One of the most hilarious reviews I've read about this game was ""I think I'm starting to get it"" by a person with 1400+ hours on record (it should be somewhere in the reviews section). The thing is, it might not be too far from the truth. There's always something new to learn about the game, something interesting to read about. I always find myself having a few tabs open in my browser with articles, guides, forums, all related to the game, trying to stack up on knowledge to better understand different aspects of the game. However, don't think that you can't enjoy the game early on. I've been enjoying it from day one and having fun ever since. And if you don't like what you're doing anymore, just drop it and start doing something else. It's best to try out different things so that you can find out what you like doing most; and you can always come back to what you were doing, it's a sandbox, remember?

Second of all, it's a complex game that requires seriousness, patience and attention, to say the least. There's times for just having fun and not caring what's going to happen, and there's times when you have to be dead serious and can't even blink, all while your heart's racing to a -maybe even- dangerous level. There's times when you're wandering solo in dead silence, looking for that big prize that you're hoping to find before anyone sees you and there's times when you're running in a big fleet, everyone hooked up to a voice chat and you feel the adrenaline rush of being in the same space as dozens, maybe hundreds or (why not?) even thousands of other ships and you're just stunned by the view and scenery, trying to keep up and make the best of it while also making it back alive.

Third of all, it's all run by the community. From the ship you're flying to the modules you've eqquiped it with to the very market you use everyday and all the way to the stations (and lately citadels) that you're docking up into. It's all planned, constructed and placed by the community (except the initial NPC stuff already in-place of course, but that's only a small portion of it); and let's not forget it is all priced by the community as well, as the market is as realistic as real life markets in many if not most aspects, always being influenced by events and everything that's happening in the EVE universe. And there's also the aspect of corps, alliances and coalitions, which along with everything said above merge into the best game stories I've ever read and could fill out whole books. (oh, wait, it already has!).

All in all, it's a unique game that gives a unique feeling and experience which cannot be found in any other game. Its harsh world and complexity make it a hard game, but the satisfaction you get for acomplishments definitely makes it worthwile. That being said, it's not a game for everyone. However, everyone [b]should[/b] try it out and if you remember to keep an open mind, who knows, maybe you'll find that it was the best decision in your gaming life.

Pros:
[list]unique experience you can't find anywhere else[/list]
[list]great mechanics[/list]
[list]high complexity[/list]
[list]run by the community[/list]
[list]stunning views and scenery[/list]
[list]story rich (mostly made by the community)[/list]

Cons:
[list]time consuming[/list]
[list]subscription-based (can be ruled out by paying with in-game currency)[/list]
[list]can seem harder at first[/list]

Quick Setup:  I bought the game a week ago.  Steam / EVE had a weekend free trial.  I downloaded the trial, and was immediately hooked.  First day of the trial, I bought the starter pack for $5.  Later bought Aurum for $5.  Then the Colonist DLC for $5.  The first few hours the game has some very cool parts to it.  Good graphics, more complicated than Civilizations, and different from most other games I have.  But... after 6 days of playing 17 hours a day, I'm pretty much done forever with this game.  I do not recommend that you get it.  Here's why.

1.  NOT New Member Friendly.  The game has been around more than 10 years.  Every player in the game is more powerful than you are, because you just signed up.  Some are ridiculously more powerful.  Every player in the game can attack you.  Anyone of those supposedly ~150 thousand players who didn't sign up the same month as you, can attack you and will destroy you, no matter where you are.  There are no safe zones.  There are no peaceful leave me in peace areas for new members.  My first ship lost was in a 0.9 area.  Areas in space are rated for safety using a system that's maximum safety is 1.0.  Two players warped into a 0.9 area, destroyed my ship in 7 seconds, and left.  You will be bullied and destroyed multiple times a day, for many many months, as you are hunted for sport, by players who have a ridiculous wealth and game advantage that you will quite honestly, never catch up to.  How long would you be willing to pay a monthly fee to get nowhere?  Forget the fees, how long would you play a game where your role is to be blown up by everyone you encounter and provide them points on a kill board?  

2.  No Game Support. I wrote 3 support tickets for help.  The first request, they took 4 days just to respond.  They didn't resolve the issue and by that time, I really didn't care.  The best part was, I was contacting them to get support to spend more money on the game!  And they didn't care about that.  The second issue, their response, didn't answer my question.  The third... its been 28 hours, no response yet.  I used to do Computing Support.  Know how long we had to respond to an issue?  4 hours, not 86.

3.  No Single Player options.  This is an MMO. That means thousands of players in one game.  In the 6 days that I played, there were on average, 20,000 people logged on.  Now, its an MMO, and maybe you're fine with ALWAYS doing something with someone else.  But IF you are like me, and you might be logging in early morning, late at night, and you didn't sign up with 10 at the same time, and you just want to hop on for a short time, do your own thing, and then get back to sleep... NO.  You cant do that here.  The last day that I played, I took my ship out 3 times.  It was attacked all three times and destroyed twice.  One person showed me mercy and let me go.  I didn't overcome an attack, I begged him not to destroy me, and he nicely let me go.  The other two laughed and destroyed my ships.  Ships are not free, nor are the components or upgrades.  The 12 hours it took to mine resources, didn't cover the cost of the ships lost. Cant do the simplest of things alone, you will die.  What percentage of the time will you get attacked?  Well... on the last day, it was 3 for 3, so yeah, All The Time.

4.  Extremely High Startup Cost.  There is a Serious Game Imbalance.  You can actually find several articles on the internet about EVE's membership problems.  I wonder why they have difficulty getting new subscriptions when it only takes years to build up your character to a level where it could more than the most boring, mundane, and time wasting tasks in the game.  You could go the normal route and wait years as you pay your monthly subscription and slowly build up your skills.  (simplified explanation): Skills build up over time at a linear or constant rate.  You can slightly modify this, but unlike other games, 10 battles / day, will not advance your skills any faster than 0 battles per day.  The skills just build up over time, slowly, as you pay your $10 - $15 membership fees each month.  Want to advance faster, then spend more money.  You can buy something called a PLEX, for about $18, which you can sell for in game currency, which you could then buy Skill Injectors, which give you about 1 month worth of skills added to your character.  Two Plex will get you about three skill injectors.  Three skill injectors will get you about what you need to stop piloting the super crappy ships, instead you can now pilot the crappy ships.  Want to get to the good ships?  Buy another 3-4 Plex.  So you can either wait years paying your membership, or you can pay your membership AND spend $100 on Plex which you can accelerate you to a much faster start.  Keep in mind that I did get 4 Plex worth of skills, and the result was still to be destroyed by everyone who decided to attack me.

5.  In Game Assistance was terrible.  The company (CCP), has a certain number of players who answer questions in the Rookie Help Chat.  Probably get paid with in game items or Free subscription or whatever.  Not a bad idea.  But the execution is terrible.  I asked the same question on a different day, and got the word for word same answer that wasn't helpful and was insulting.  This prompted me to ask the question again later, just to see IF a third person would respond in the exact same manner.  Instead they just ignored me and didn't answer, which also happens.  I see a ton of people asking questions, and sometimes (my estimate 20%), they just dont get answered.  When they get stuck on something they cant answer, they dont, or they say its realistic.  What about this that doesn't make any sense?  Its realistic.  What about this that isn't fair?  Its realistic.  What about this that isn't fun?  Its realistic.  The answer itself is also a stupid answer, because you're trying to claim realism for a SCI-FI video game in which every single thing is made up / fake!  And Oh....  another 10-20 percent of what is asked, they cant help with, they direct you to create a support ticket.  Good luck getting an answer on that.



I dont want a video game that causes more anger than joy.  You could spend ridiculous amounts of money on the game, all at once, or every month, or both, and still be destroyed ALL the time.  This game should be classified as pay to lose.  Its like playing the lottery; odds are incredibly against you, AND instead of losing $2, you can lose 64 Million when you take your ship out, or win 10 Million.  Not a good deal.  Every time you get destroyed, you're either losing hours of time you spent building up wealth, or real world money you spent purchasing that equipment.  The last ship I lost set me back 12 hours of drudgery to accumulate that wealth.  Most of the people I interacted with, was a bad experience in some way.  The very last of which, when I complained in the rookie chat help about being attacked 3 times in a row; one of their helpers said she had lost TEN ships in a row on one day, and she didn't complain about it.  People dont often realize how the comments they make might be interpreted.  This comment tells me that either:  You Don't have any common sense, because who would do the exact same thing with the exact same result, 10 times in a row?  Or you're just repeating a company line to make it seem like thats not unheard of, or you are just a liar.  10 ships in a row, for me, would have meant I just lost $30 or the last 120 hours of my life.

In Any Event....  I DO NOT recommend you get the game, and google instead  Eve On-line Single,  google will fill in the rest long before you can put in Single Player Alternative to EVE-Online.

It has an interesting learning curve, in which the key aspect of the game is and always will be, how much time you invest in it. (Some would argue money as well.)This game has a feature which gave me a goal when I started in this game, to be able to pay for the subscription with the in game money. So now then how would you achieve this?
- Taking one of the Hulks of mining barges (Which appropiately is named Hulk) and start your own Industrial company. I used to supply a couple of corporations (guilds) with ships and weapons so they'll basicly kill eac outher out.

- Being a trader, the game uses a lovely user controlled marketplace in which everything is bought and sold by a player. Prices also vary in between regions, and taxes apply in different factors soo there is always money to be made.

- Mission Running, Incursions, Sites  all of these pve options are quite fun and some of my favorite activities. Sure, the mission running gets dull after a while of going in killing that and going back.

- Pirates! Aside from the High-Security areas in the game, you can go and fight anyone you find. (Of course not guaranteed you will win) and in this way become a space pirate. If you piss off someone enough that they put a bounty on you, they give you a nice little ""Wanted"" tag.

As much as I love this game, there are some things that could be done better. No game is perfect, so I'll highlight some personal Pros and Cons.

PROS
-Rewarding if you stick with it. It's always fun to see yourself grow from a tiny cruiser pilot to the owner of a massive frigate
-You can make a living in the game by doing just about anything. From mining rocks all day to being a filhty pirate.
-The universe is rather large, and there's a lot of ground to cover (Like any MMO)
-Players drive the economy
-You can buy subscription with in game cash! :D

CONS
-It's really difficult for newer players to actually get into this game. Yes, they can play for a few hours and enjoy it...But it takes a lot of dedication and patience to actually end up somewhere noteable
-The subscription. For a game that's so exclusive feeling, it seems like a bad idea to have a subscription for only allowing a Two week trial period. Based upon most peoples schedules, two weeks isn't enough to truly experience the game. 
-You never really get told where it's a good idea to go and where is not. There are a lot of places that you can get swarmed by people who just want to make your day tough. Losing your ship means losing your ship, so it's hard to move up in the world when you're constantly being sent back to the beginning. 

IN CONCLUSION
-I think this game is a good game to get into. It's fun and makes you feel good when you begin your slow crawl into the heart of space.",1472020904,1472020904,True,3,0,0.53700101375579834,0,True,False,False

If you want to play a game that tells you what to do at every turn, hey listen, this isn't the game for you. There is so much freedom to do what you want it can be daunting. It really captures the vastness of the cosmos. Here are the possible ""career"" paths one could take: http://eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg

Be prepared to spend a good amount of time learning the interface. I wouldn't say it's really difficult (so far). But, there is a steep learning curve to the controls. There are many video tutorials under the F12 > Tutorials. Some tutorials don't make everything clear, so use YouTube too or the Rookie Chat to ask questions.

Edit: I changed my review when I discovered you *can* use the ""EVE Online - Core Starter Pack"" with a Steam FTP Weekend account.

The game is more then a game.  EVE confronts you with the absolute freedom to do anything you want, in space.  This scares a lot of players as there is no path to follow, you create your own path.  The new version of the tutorial is far better then it was ages ago when I started the game and shows off many of the systems the game offers to play in.  The stories you've heard of this game about massive wars, huge corp espionage, and massive back-stabbing are all true.  The game doesn't punish you for much and even then it is usually just a small decrease in your security rating.  Gang teams do roam the ""safe"" space areas and will kill you just for giggles.  The learning curve of this game is not hard, the hard part is learning to play a game where consequences are real.  Your ship got destroyed?  It is gone forever, there is no save point to go back to.  Pissed off another player, they may call in friends to grief you, or worse yet blacklist you across their alliance.  Jumped into wormhole space and forgot to bookmark the exit?  Lol, drift forever until you decide to self-destruct your ship.  

What then draws people into this game?  The fact the you do impact the overall universe, even if just in the smallest way.  You choose to mine your days away?  Your new influx of minerals can push down the market costs.  Start taking transport jobs?  You could be delivering the weapons/equipment an alliance needs to turn the tide of battle in a region of space.  Became a pirate?  Live on the edge and enjoy the rush of kills and looking over your shoulder.  

The game is amazing.  I play it for a few months each year because it is a blast to play.  I can only do small chuncks of it because I become too involved in it.  If you give EVE a chance, it will do the same to you.

Eve features one of the most political player driven environments available, complete with under-the-table deals, backstabbing, high-rolling casino warlords, mercenaries and more. There are player rivalries that have lasted over a decade and things only seem to escalate as time goes on.

What to expect: Skyrim In Space.

The game is hilariously big, to the point that playing over the years to perfect an aspect of it will still leave you with several others unexplored.

It's a sandbox. You have a ship and a handful of money. Now go out there, and make yourself something.

So, the ""Hype hype hooray"" parts you probably read about:

Yes, you can shoot someone in the face (well, ship) and you can be shot in the ship.
In fact, you can do that even in the ""safe"" zones, if you pull it off right.
Yes, you can join someone's corporation, gain their trust and rob them blind.
Yes, you can create a ponzi scheme.
Yes, you can lie, scam and get rich this way.
Yes, you can become an industrial ""god of spreadsheets"", manufacturing everything someone else may need to continue their adventure.
Yes, the game has an amazing lore! It's well hidden. Go find it.
Yes, CCP is supporting it. Hell, they're actually updating graphics up to modern standard - including new models for ships.

The gritty:

- You will be getting an alt. And you will likely be dualboxing your main character, and your alt. Certain things in the game are better if you have two different pilots. Say, a pirate and his trusty scammer alt.

- You will not be handed a big battle right off the bat. In fact, the grand battles are spectacular, rare events. Participating in one in a role that you like to fill is an experience of its own. Many fights are resolved in small skirmishes.

- There's politics. I don't mean NPC world politics, I mean player politics. Since the game allows you to plant your flag somewhere... yup, there's gonna be politics. I consider it a good, unique feature - but others may disagree.

The bad:

- Some changes made by the devs can, and will, make you cringe. And no, not talking about 'P2W' (you will find out quickly that killing someone who paid a lot of cash for a ship he didn't know how to fly is a bit of a rite of passage for the more piratey kind of pilot).

- My Arazu still looks ugly.


So, if by a chance you wound up not only reading my review, but reaching this point - how do you take on EVE?

In three ways:

You can shelter yourself from the community, never leave high security space and quit out of boredom.
You can hit low security space, put on your eyepatch and dust off your trusted parrot - get in fights, meet people, join a proper pirate group.
You can take a running leap and slam yourself deep into the political side of things. Take it all with a grain of salt, and don't let the badposting overdose kill you - and you'll find one of the richest gaming experiences.

Now, this was supposed to be a quick summary and I wrote a wall of text. So, I'm off to my watch - there are bad people who don't agree with my space dictator that need to explode, also their space dictator is bad.",1471634912,1471634912,True,131,54,0.848026275634765625,4,True,False,False

It is not your traditional MMO. It relies heavily on the fact that it's all about its player-created universe. It is a little slow paced, and you do will not want to do PVE for PVE's sake forever.

But where else can you actually watch empires rise and fall detached from some developer's scripted boring plot? We recently had a war where half the playerbase was hired to the rough equivalent of $11,000 to go destroy one of the biggest, longest-standing, and most toxic entities in the game.

Beyond that, there's smaller games of cat and mouse to be played inside low-security space and wormholes, and the thrills of actual risk that are so thoroughly divorced from MMOs and shooters. When you blow up someone else's ship, it stays gone, providing a satisfaction to destruction I can't get from WoW or Overwatch.

Give it a try. It'll take some work to figure out - I've played a long time and I'm not even close - but each piece the game reveals to me is another reward.",1471632428,1471632428,True,7,0,0.515229284763336182,0,True,False,False

Well to start, its one of the very few MMOs that I have played in the past several years that still keeps me interested. Constant updates like the new Citadels or upcoming ship revamping to the player community in game make Eve some of the best fun I've ever had. 
One of the best pieces of advice I can give new players is to activly seek out people and corps to join up with. Eve is a very player driven game and most of the fun comes from playing with other players. There are corperations for every type of player from the combat hard fleet commander to the casual miner, daily players or weekly/monthly types. The best thing you can do is give the game a try. Eve constantly runs a 14-21 day trail program that will give you a near full game experiance and Steam offers from time to time offers a free weekend that will give you FULL access to everything Eve has to offer. 
If you dont want to take my word, the nearly 2000 hours I have registered on Steam should give you a good idea about how much I like it and you may too.

EVE online is a massively multiplayer online resource management, economic simulator, tactical / strategical space combat social sandbox video game. You don’t play this game because you enjoy every moment, you play it because you know that at some point between vast vistas of emptiness something may happen that changes in-game history. That you may be a part of that change. You play it because it helps refine and maintain skills that you can apply in real life. You play it because you are a part of it as much as it is a part of you. If you come into EVE expecting a game with your goals clearly defined and the ability to assert power through in-game mechanics then you have set yourself up to fail. Much as the EVE wormhole led mankind to New Eden, EVE Online is a portal through which we the players are thrust, left to create a narrative that transcends the confines of the game client. EVE is unforgiving in that you may find yourself stuck forever in hi-sec performing mundane tasks, leading you to have a poor experience. But likewise if you have the motivation, the focus and the dedication you can learn how the game works and exploit it to your benefit. Just as Veldspar is an in-game resource, so is the miner who gathers it. Governing bodies are formed by real people, held together by real networks and real ideals. EVE Online is a game that demands the player to think 5 steps ahead. To prioritise and to plan. To think for themselves. For some this is asking too much. For others it is the only game worth playing.

10/10 would think for myself again.

I've known about this game for nearly a decade but never tried it because I was put off by claims it was difficult and needed massive spreadsheets to play.  Thats complete nonsense and the game is easy to get into so long as you are capable of reading instructions, have the not so common ability to use google, and have some semblence of social skills.  I started out with nothing about 3 months ago and I'm now an active member in a corporation managing manufactering and resource production whilst also particitpating in doctrined fleets.  Then again I do have the advantage of not being borderline retarded.  Don't listen to numbskulls claiming it isn't new player friendly.  The game doesn't hold your hand or coddle you thats all, and thats how all games should be.  You will die alot in the beginning unless you are a pansy who just hides in high sec, but once you do you will learn how to let go and move on.  Try new things right from the start.  Run to lowsec and attack someone for the hell of it, jump head first into a wormhole throwing caution to the wind.  Hell I went wormhole exploring my fifth day in and got ganked, but the dude was so impressed that I had the balls to jump in there and take risks despite being new he sent me 50m and a corp invite.  

Nothing is safe and thats what I like about it.  Your belongings have real value since at any time you could lose them with one false move and you have no one to blame but yourself.  Give this game a go if you want a challenging game that has the best emergent gameplay I've seen yet. 

10/10 buying 2 more accounts to maximise PI and mining output.

Update:  To all these recent reviews about how the game is too punishing and how its not fair people gank you and you lost your stuff.  Boo hoo if you had read even one guide before starting the game you would have known that was going to happen.  The first thing every single guide tells you is not to fly what you can't afford to lose.  Thats not a suggestion, thats a rule.  Occassionally I'll fly an expensive ship that like a battleship and lose it but I took the risk and knew the consequences so I move on and work towards another.  Learn how to produce your own ships and fittings, thats what I do.  When you become self sufficient losing items seems like nothing when you got tons in storage and many more in production.  With my 2 accounts I can produce more then enough ships and isk to pvp all day without crying about a few blown up ships.  Its not even that hard or time consuming.  Its not like you have to grind skills you can leave them for a month to level on their own, and the game literally throws mountains of isk at you.

Don't give the game a thumbs down because you failed to grasp the simpliest of concepts it introduces and thus are butthurt when it chews you up and spits you out.  Its not the games fault you were too scared to experiment and ended up mining 100 hours in a venture then quiting because you were bored.

I think I have another month to go and I'm not even interested in it. The graphics are really crap unless you zoom right up to shlt.. and you'll never end up doing that because everything you kill is far far away. 



(The game is super slow. The skill timmer system is the worst. You can log off for days waiting to play with a functional skill set to use a particular ship. Grafix are ok but they get repetative quick. 

eve in a nutshell. Train skill, quest, get killed, Buy new ship, Buy skills to use ship, buy equipment to equip ship, Use ship, Get killed, Buy new ship, Buy more equipment to use ship, grind money, Get killed buy new ship Buy more equipment to use ship, grind money, Get killed buy new ship Buy more equipment to use ship, grind money, Get killed buy new ship

You don't have to be there 24/7 to train, though it's slower to train what you want. hell, i did a think on a calculator where i can see how long it would take to train all skills, about 68 years... that was about 4 years ago when i checked so i'm sure it's different but man, that means there is a lot to train, a lot of different things you can do.

Their plan seems to be to try and get you invested in the game early, so you stick around to pay a monthly fee to keep skilling up. The system is dumb. 
Charge people 40 bucks for the game, drop monthly sub and sell cosmetic DLC and let people have fun. They are not only keeping people away with the high price, but hurting the people who do pay good money by keeping the community much smaller then it should be.

At this point I would maybe pay a monthly fee of 5 bucks for this game, and only for the social aspect. The rest is simply designed to drag on and keep the money rolling in the Devs pockets. This game is over 10 years old now and they still want top dollar to play it.

The game itself is good and all, but the skill system simply ruins it, you are supposed to wait days, weeks and months for your skills to be trained, literally preventing you from advancing in the game.

I think the game itself is pretty good, but this system just ruins it, and the only way to shorten the training time is to buy skill injectors that are expensive as hell, forcing you to buy plex in order to sell it to buy the injectors unless you can make a god dammed fortune to afford them.

In the past two years I have tried to play this game (and get addicted) ~five times.

Combat against AI in missions is boring, trading runs are boring, mining is boring and the only thing motivating you to keep going is to get a better ship (= catch up with other players) and to be invited in a corporation to become part of one of these cool stories you hear every once in a while.

But catching up is boring. I don't want to play with my space dumpster for 30 hours until I finally get a chance to actually do something meaningful in this game. It kind of reminds me of leveling in other MMORPGs.

Trying to like the game five times over the past few years has had a positive effect: I noticed how the tutorial and the interface steadily improved. At least that hurdle got fixed.

Eve Online...... It isn't a skilled based MMO, it's a Time & Money based MMO... What you have to understand when playing this game is that how ever good you are(myself one of the best pilots in europe on Star Wars Galaxies) it means nothing because how you equip yourself and your ship is based on how long you've played ... pure and simple. I'll give you an example, I spent 13 days trying to save Isk(in game currency) to make a ship with its parts to use to kill npcs but there are no pvp toggles in this game it is open.... so that 13 days work in a matter of 2 minutes was blown to pieces by players who have been playing it longer than you mostly up to 1 or 2 years longer than you... My grandfather calls it ""Pi**ing in the wind"". You can never catch those players up in class of equipment because the ""SKILL TREE"" is based on time not actual skill.... So if your thinking of buying it remember.... Even if you are a decently skilled player... unless you have a considerable amount of money to spend rushing your skill tree which takes about £30 for 10 days worth which on average the higher skills are around 19 days long and that is just one of many you'd need... I truly wish I hadn't bothered.

EVE Online is not a game that can be rushed.  There is just so much to do even in High-Sec Space, and much more in Low-Sec and Null-Sec space.

As for the time it takes to train the skills needed for the ships, modules, and everything.  There's so many of them that it is difficult to train all of them.  The long training times are there to keep players from becoming uber-bad arses at everything.  EVE Online is a game about balance, not who is the most powerful and skilled out there.

Patience is often called a virtue and a necessity in RL.  EVE Online requires that patience not be a virtue, but a necessity in everything.  If you rush things, then you will lose a lot.",1463206004,1463206004,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Clearly my initial experience my have been marred by some who were not willing to assist in any way but thankfully that has changed due to a very nice corp with alot of very nice people. If you play this game and find help limited as i did to start with, join a corp and hopefully they will be as helpful as the one i was invited to. Theres a lot to do once you know and the visual aspect of the game is quite stunning. The tutorials and oppotunities are quite useless but the Career Agents teach you way more and reward you in a big way. The best advice someone gave me and gave others was press F12 and follow Industry 1st till get a Venture(you will understand when do) then swop over and do the military ones. They will provide you with ships and loads of in game cash. They are also fun and teach you what the tutorials try to anyway, in general though just right click on anything for options, whether its your ship, an object or something in space. To be Frank (whoever he is) the game is very good! any initial problems about any learning curve are obsolete provided you find someone who WILL help you, the best way for that is join a corp/guild/group whatever previous MMOS/games had similar. Also the universe of EVE is MASSIVE! and if go exploring it can be quite nervy going through space in a little ship, with pirates around, particulary when go in what is referred to as 'Lowsec' as space gets dodgier the lower it gets to 0.0. Space is measured from 0.0 - 1.0, 0.0 being for experienced players with i gather ships, resources and fleets a plenty. 1.0 space is safe but still get attacked by little pirate vessels. They are not hard in general in 1.0 space and round that level but adds an element of the Meercat where you are constantly looking on Horizon for a red dot that is heading for you! IRL as in Nature red means danger and it does here too but the specialisation of ships the game has to other is amazing! A newb could kill an experienced player if their ship was specialised in a set way the other was not. Ships can not have every specc and so any weaknesses can be exploited with knowledge, luck and right mods. I love flying around trying to do me career missions and when go through 'lowsec' space (0.5 and below) feeling paranoid that some ganker is in the next asteroid belt that i am heading for! A perfect game to watch TV, listen to music (trance, dance, anything with 'ance' at the end) is great while playing and 12 hours later (which feels like 3) you realise just how immersed and fun it really is. Some people have left comments as they were witness to my original rant of 'rage quit' which i find funny knowing now what i know about the game and the help within the corp i had and still have if need at anytime. They are spot on in there comments and to CrazyWolffy if i put you off this game then please feel free to call me a moron once you play it and realise......well that i was a moron for my original post. Just to re-itterate, this game is quite stunning, if play please press your portrait top left and under skills, ship command, add some to the skill que, keep it stocked as counts down when logged off too and press F12 and do Industry for your 1st free ship then swop over to Military for more. Also get yourself in a corp, i did those few things and it made all the difference to my gaming experience.

It can be a great game with countless hours of enjoyment.. But it can also be a giant waste of money and [b]time[/b].. And more than likely, something you will not play for more than few hours, or weeks ever.

As someone who's played Eve for the better part of [b]9[/b] years. I've done practically everything at one point or another. Been in giant alliances and fought wars against russians. Got bored of industry and planetary crap, did the whole small corp pvp, stealth bombers and black ops. I've lived in 0.0, did the whole wormhole life and pve side of the game and quite honestly I just simply don't care for it [the game] anymore as a whole.

[u]The game itself has changed... [i](honestly)[/i] very little.[/u]


The ""expansions"" CCP launch every year, do offer new and decent content [i](Usually)[/i]. However, MOST of the content CCP provides for EVE is [b]not something every player see's or experiences.[/b]


And as such, I've known many players who basically experience NONE of the new stuff provided in expansions, [b]YEAR AFTER YEAR.[/b] and are, more or less, playing the exact same game from 4 - 5+ years ago.

There is a very real problem with EVE that I will get into in just a bit. But what EVE succeeds at ... it does... Pretty well.
It's a decent game if you have people to play with, people who know what they are doing. If you are able to join a decent corp.

If you have no friends, or no one to play EVE with, it's normally an extremely lackluster experience, very boring, and very very lonely. EVE can also be very harsh. You can get scammed, lose all your assets, and lose hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of items in game.

I knew a person who after playing the game for a month, bought a bunch of plexs. Who then undocked, and was then blown up. He lost about $300~ worth of plex. Needless to say, he quit the game shortly after.

EVE, for the most part, is a very ruthless game. You need to play it almost in the mindset of something like an even more hardcore dark souls. Expect to die, or lose your ship. Don't fly stuff you can't afford to lose, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Plan our what you're doing, where you're going. Know what you are doing, before you do it. Which, can be a little much when you are starting out.

I've known a lot of new players, and have helped a lot of new players with the game.
But, there are a lot of misconceptions. Mostly thrown off by CCP themselves, with how they portray the game... And there's a lot of unknowns and things that you just will not get your head around till you've spent a lot of time/money in the game (For the most part).

I've known plenty of people who spent months trying to get a certain ship, only to find out.. That ship was not what they expected, and they were extremely dissapointed and wound up leaving the game due to it. It's depressing to work for a carrier for many months, then to finally get it and realize.. Oh, you can't actually really use it unless you have other people or accounts to play with. There's a lot of aspects in the game that are awesome, however... They (Honestly) are not executed well imo.

Over the years, instead of EVE changing them to make them better. They've stuck with their somewhat flawed design in ways that has left a lot of people basically... In the dust. It keeps the regulars, but for the most part... A lot of other people just can't stick with it.

A lot of things in EVE really just are not designed that well for a solo player in specific scenarios. And generally, for a new player starting off... That is how it's played. Which is AWFUL. Then there's the dissapointment people get when they realize, they can't do what they thought they could. Or what they want to do. This is a [b]hard limitation of the core game design.[/b]

EVE is a game for groups of people. If you play by yourself, you will almost certainly be bored out of your mind more than likely. You will more than likely quit the game within the first few hours.

EVE is just not good at that, and probably never will be.



Don't get me wrong, I love EVE. I always have, even though I have a lot of problems with it. I still play it to this day. I've had numerous accounts over the years and it's still something that I usually come back to for a few months every expansion. Then drop off, of course once I realize there's still nothing there for me.

Most people I knew that were hardcore into EVE and used to nolife the game, have never played it again.. There's usually two types of EVE players. Those that love it, and play it all the time. And those that play it, hate it, and never play it again.

I'm a bit of an odd one stuck in the middle but oh well :P

I hope that one day CCP can actually change some of the things that HOLD eve online back from being the best it can be. But I know that will probably never happen, I still enjoy seeing and hearing about the fleet fights, watching the killboards, and playing every now and then but... EVE can get extremely stale for a lot of people, and that's why even people who love it might never come back.

Honestly, would I reccomend EVE? Not really because MOST people (Once again, talking about in general) do not like it, and have a real hard time with the game.

There, of course, are people that love EVE and eat it up like there's no tomorrow. Great, but for most people.. It just isn't worth it.

That said, if you are interested in trying out EVE let me know. You can use my referral here.

While I certainly had fun in it, the lack of any real sense of purpose just kills it. The systems in it are super slow and tedius to use, combat super slow and calculating, requiring a suprisingly small amount of skill, as everything is in the prep work and larger strategy.

Basically, the way I see it, this is the kind of game that for me was best played before i knew what i was doing. Once I was told I really shouldn't be doing virtually everything i was doing, the game became entirely boring. While I was aimlessly wandering about and got podded by some dude, i laughed super hard. When i ran across a bunch of enemies i shouldn't be near and got killed in 2 hits, i found it fun. When i found missions for my own level after I started getting some decent-ish ships, the game came grinding down to a halt. Every mission was ""check to see weaknesses, load out accordingly, target enemy and wait. Target enemy and wait. Target enemy and wait. Target enemy and wait.""

I don't see this being a game I ever return to, but I don't regret my time in it either. It was radically different from any mmo i've tried before and I give it credit for that. That said, it just doesn't appeal to me much.

Old Review
Yes...The trailer looks cool but not even close to how the game feels. The gameplay isn't fast pace, it doesn't require major motor skills. Most of the time your encounters have a predecided outcome that you just don't know about yet because you didn't think about what could happen.

With that being said if you walk into the wrong space you might find yourself dead in seconds. Eve Online is a strategy game to me. The next guy might say its a market trading simulator and the next might say its a mining simulator. To put it in short, eve online has alittle something for everyone.

Eve Online is also one of the only games out there that lets players backstab each other in the worst ways. It is not aginst Eve onlines TOS to scam another player out of there ISK(in-game money) or items. On the other hand it is against TOS to scam a player out of real money and worldly stuff.

Eve Online hates new players and all new players get to learn the hard way on the do's and don'ts.
The following ""Cookie acronym"" was created just for this...

""WoW holds your hand from 1-85, and makes sure you get a cookie regardless if you win or lose. Eve not only takes your cookie, but laughs at you for bringing one in the first place.""

So these bonuses to their crap makes a 1v1 situation impossible.

In addition to all of this, it's completely pay to win!  People buy plex on the market (1 plex = 1 month gameplay = 1billion in-game currency).  So a plex costs around $10-15 and people don't hesitate to buy these and sell them.  I played for 2-3 weeks and was bored, it was literally like working rather than having fun.

This game should be considered something not easy to accomplish. The game is a pay2pay game, if you don't follow: After you pay for a starter pack on steam, you must pay monthly subscriptions, or try getting an item named ""PLEX"" (Pilot License EXtension.)

For those who don't know what PLEX is, and how expensive it is read on below:

- PLEX is an item which allows you to gain one month of gametime or to be redeemed for one of the rewards below:
  - Gain 3500 AURUM, a currency which allows you to buy Ship skins, and Character clothing, and other services (see below)
  - Gain 30 days of a ""Multiple Training Certificate"". If multiple characters are used (to a max of 3) on a single account, and you want to train both characters, the ""Multiple Training Certificate"" gives you an additional training queue. [b]Under  no circumstances you may train 2 skills at once on a single character.[/b]

Now that PLEX is out of the way with, i want to talk about the statistics of how money is being made, and how easy this ""PLEX"" is availible to get.

""PLEX"" at the moment of writing scales from 1 Billion ""ISK"" (Ingame Currency: InterStellar Kredit), to 1.5 Billion ""ISK"". ""ISK"" is relatively easy to get in small numbers (especially with project exploration, if youre willing to be bored to death), but getting something about 1 Billion in ISK is something very hard to accomplish.

It is very hard to explain how this game works (VEEERRRYYY STEEEEEEPPP LEARNING CURVE), but as far as i know, theres 4 main roles in the game (as stated in special edition tab):

- You can be a skirmisher, who runs through ""combat sites"" to eliminate bad ships (PvE) and gain loot in exchange. I am not familiar with this, because i never took this path.
- You can be an explorer, someone who traces down space anomalies (Wormholes, Data sites: Read down below, Relic Sites), ""hack"" the sites, and gain (expensive) loot in exchange. This is quite a hard path to go down, because it takes a lot of money to get the equipment to be prepared for this.
- You can be a colonist (youre not really ""the colonist""), which ""colonizes"" (more kinda industrialises) planets and exploits them in order to gain materials, which can be processed at the planet into end-products, which are worth quite a couple of ISK on the market.
- You can be a industrialist, which mines asteroids (ore can be sold directly) for use in blueprints, whereoff the end product results in either a ship, a module, or whatever you can come up with, as long as its nothing out of the ordinary (Special (event) loot)

But its quite hard to get started as i stated before. It takes a lot of time to get the starting skills trained (Skill system), even with the Prototype Cerebum you'll get from start (A one-time use item, which you can't buy, which speeds up training speed considerably). Training times can scale up to 1 MONTH, which basically means you should've either sold your ""PLEX"" by then (to speed up using skill injectors, for ~667 MILLION ISK) or you would've used your first ""PLEX"" by then.

So, i wouldn't recommend this to the average player, unless youre sitting on a pile of cash, and you want to pay your first 12 months training skills using the subscription system. DO NOT (unless you want a lot of ISK at once) BUY PLEX, because its a LOT more expensive than actually taking a subscription.",1460899014,1460899014,False,4,0,0.483551830053329468,0,True,False,False

The problem with other MMOs is, players have no real, long-lasting impact on the game world. That boss you just killed? He's going to respawn in 2 minutes to allow for the next group of players to complete that quest. And so most MMOs are a tedious grindfest of fetch quests and uninspired raids in which every player is but a puppet in a world devoid of life, just running around on endless errands that go nowhere.

EVE is not like that.

EVE isn't a game: it's a sandbox. A hypercapitalist simulator. The players make the rules, they enforce them, and they break them. The consequences are real. Mistakes are costly, and death is permanent. The learning curve is steep. Very, very steep: more than 300 hours in, I still feel like a noob. But whether I'm mining on my own in a low-security area of space, or exploring a wormhole in search of a quick buck, or speculating on the commodity market, or trying to gain some notoriety in a remote outpost along with a rabble of scoundrels, I know that danger is lurking around the corner, and that I can't afford to let my guard down.

An impressive creation that everyone should at least experience. There's a lot of misconceptions surrounding the experience of new players, the learning curve, character progression and such, so I suggest you at least give EVE a fair go before choosing to avoid it. Like all games, it has its issues, but the common complaints, while I see where they are coming from, are frequently over exaggerated and naive. EVE online works much differently than other popular MMOs, so keep that in mind if you see/hear of a mechanic that sounds a bit iffy (such as the time based skill progression).

Downsides to EVE is basically the balance between high, low and nullsec. In highsec, outside of playing the market, there's essentially no way of making money outside of doing L4s, the have other things, but they don't pay anything worth your time. Looting/salvaging in EVE is such a slow and tedious process without a second account or friend it's not worth doing over rushing (blitzing) the mission. Suicide gankers basically kill anyone or anything, anywhere in highsec, I've never been ganked personally and I actually scored a kill on a ganker once, but the concept of being killed through cheesing concorde mechanics, while being incredibly safe from retalitory action by the system you are cheesing, is a bit weird. It's also dangerous to the health of the game, noobs often get caught into being a miner (instead of security) and will get suicide ganked, then they leave the game and post a bad review. Also they basically harass miners all day who are already making next to zero isk per hour. The devs should just remove 90% of high sec if their interest is to make everywhere dangerous or get people into low sec. Problem of low sec is most of the content isn't worth the risk for the reward you are going to get, there's good opportunities for low risk, low reward small group/solo PVP in low sec however. Nullsec is basically controlled by a small number of coalitions, so you aren't going to get anywhere there unless you want to join a blob. You also can't get ships big enough to do PVE content in low or nullsec, so basically most PVE'rs will be buying over 1 bill isk ships to do L4s all day. There's basically gate camps everywhere, with that in mind and suicide ganking in high sec, you get the impression there's nothing to do in the game, why else would you waste your time with that if you had better things to do?

The GINI coefficient of EVE is also absolutely borked, PLEX's are totally overpriced and unfeasible for most people to buy, instead your smartest option is to buy a plex with real money and sell it. This mostly comes from the fact that the large corps control so much money they can buy thousands of ships, an near infinite amount of PLEX and RMT at the same time. I don't really know why corps have been able to become that powerful when RMT is forbidden, is easily tracked by CCP, but suspicously, it is rampant in EVE. The corps control so much of the most (practically only) lucrative areas in the game, their wealth is absurd, and this affects everyone not involved in them. I highly suspect one or two things is at play to explain the imperialism, RMT, and prices in EVE. CCP secretly works with corps to RMT, this is known to have happened at least twice, both times of the same corp/player using a PLEX referral sham that was allowed until there was public outcry, which was incredibly dodgy. Alternatively to this, large corps RMT blatently and CCP turns a blind eye to protect the public image and to avoid reducing the playabase. Either way there's something foul at play, who makes EVE a job by running an ingame company similar to real life, without getting paid?

It's a hard game to get into as a new player and there's a lot of barriers that may get in your way when you try to do things your way (outside of getting horribly murdered), but the new player experience has been constantly improving for a little while now, so it is a good time to get into it.

You don't have to buy EVE on Steam either, you can get it from the website, you can also get some starter packs for an extra 5 dollars which may help you get started easier.

Yes, there is clearly a 'real world economy' and my God is it....probably detailed. Oh and the ships! Everything is generated in game, if there is something you see....a player built it! Isn't that amazing?!

These are the things that drew me to EVE, however after spending 25 hours, over a solid day of my actual life on this garbage I am about as close and involved to the EVE economy as a 25 hour old baby would be to the human one. 

It's spreadsheets and being a dickh*ad in space. There really is very little nuance beyond this. The whole thing plays like a space stock trader game....ok not the end of the world, right? I still think I could get into that, hopefully there is some action and excitement to make it 'feel' like a game whilst you are actually gathering resources to trade, right? Nope, for all this 'It's a griefing paradise' that I was promised, I barely saw another ship. 

25 hours in, few other ships, few missions - lots of clicking around and waiting for actual time to elapse to build my skills up. That's another thing worth considering - this game charges a monthly fee. You can only 'level up' by waiting. Not even waiting 'in game' time, waiting real life, human hours that you could spend walking your dog, shouting at your wife or playing anything that isn't this drab attempt at making Excel fascinating. You get better exclusively by paying them money, and waiting. 

I wanted the sweet economy thing to be true so badly. I even talked down other MMOs because 'EVE has this amazing online economy' and it does, it's clearly going on. I have never come across a game less accessible than this. EVE fans tout this as though it's some great selling point, however I think what's actually going on is people who have invested thousands of hours into this dross now need to convince themselves that it wasn't time wasted. 

If you haven't already invested a thousand hours, and if you're in any way normal, just don't bother. Jesus Christ this is tedious.

So, first mistake most people make when approaching EVE is they look at it like a generic game. This is no game, this is a second life. A chance to be who and what you want all while flying some beautiful ships (or in the case of some reviewers your Pod/space).

Have I done mining? Yeah, have 4 alts just for that. Have I done PvP? Yes, high, low, and null. Mission running is a nice break from running sites for PvE and can make you some good ISK (in game money).

Are noobs constantly being screwed over? Only if stupid enough to accept duel requests or loot something that tells them (and they have to acknowledge) will allow EVERYONE to attack them no matter the security status of the system (suspect flag). Also falling into that category are people who jump into low/null/wormhole space because ""There's better ore/sites there"", join faction warfare without knowing how to PvP properly, carry everything they own with them, afk in space, or allow someone to talk them into going into low/null space with them.

Your actions dictate what happens to you in game. Want help learning how to survive in EVE? Look for a corp that is focused on what you want. Want to build stuff, find an indy corp. Want to kill stuff, talk to a PvP corp. If all else fails, see about getting into EVE University, they'll sort you out.

Again, if you're stupid enough to do any of the aforementioned stuff. YOU DESERVE TO DIE.

The Steam hours played for me is not accurate, I use the launcher outside Steam so it doesn't count played hours anymore.

That said, let me start with the facts of this game:

- The community is small (at peak hours maybe 30k ppl will be playing it, in comparison to like 90k in a game like BF4)
- The learning curve is steep, very steep.
- You need real time to learn skills you can use in game
- A loss in the game has actual consequences
- Barely any PVE content
- PVP content only created by players
- Sandbox, as in player created content PVP and economy, nothing else. (this is not a sandbox game whatsoever)
- Graphics look good

Now let's get to phase 2, my opinion:

I have played this game for a long time. I can't say I have ever enjoyed playing it whatsoever. The only real sitisfaction this game gave me is when a skill completed. I am personally more of a PVE player, as I usually don't have time to get in a group, roam for a while and (hopefully) get some kills. Let me just say this, if you like pure boredom and PVE, by any means necessary go buy this game and install it right now! You will not be disappointed. The only PVE content in EVE are missions, mining and exploration. All three are extremely limited and not profitable in game unless you are lucky hitting a sleeper cache in exploration (only available to you if you have insane scanning kills, which take a lot of time to train)

PvP in this game is alive and well, so if you enjoy that, by all means try this game out. You will not be flying anything fancy anytime soon but hey, if you get a kill in a frigate class ship and you are having fun who gives a rat's @ss right?

Try joining a corporation as soon as you start the game, one that is active and can show you the ropes. Otherwise you will be stuck grinding missions from lvl 1 to 4 which feels like eternal damnation till you have waited long enough for some important and long skills to have trained. 

I can't say more than this honestly, the game feels very inactive, the developer CCP feels very uninspiring to me and changes to the game seem to make people more angry than happy. 

The player base can be very frustrating to deal with too, not a sentence is said without swearing, and taking advantage of people in this game is VERY common practice. If you want to be treated fairly play World of Warcraft on a PVE server, no harm can be done there. In EVE people will take advantage of you if you let them and scams are just as ordinary as burger joints in America. 

Try EVE out, flame other people, rage from time to time, spin your ship around in the hangar for what sometimes seems for hours at a time, kill a mind numbing amount of npc or mine thousands of rocks and gain nothing in return!

What I like about the games is the skill training queue eliminates the need for mindless grinding as all you need is a bit of patience and finding ISK has never been a problem for me.

I segmented the gameplay and started consuming it in smaller chucks of activity types and have had a blast from the word go.

One word of warning however, if you are serious about playing the game do not share assets in a Corp with your real life friends because this is a real test of character and if you are like me you will soon realize that almost everyone’s ethical standards are way below your own and therefore almost nullifies the need for further friendship.

Eve online is an Expansive, Rich MMO set in the ""Confines"" of Space. Most things(Edit:ALL) Things are built, flown and operated by players. from the ships, ammunition, warfare and all things things come together not just to set up a robust and ALIVE economy but also spur us to greater conflict amoungst ourselves.

The Devs have events on holidays and constantly update the game, we as players of course have our complaints but i have been here to witness how we ""Protest"", and its not by unsubbing. i saw the ""Burn Jita"" event where hundreds of players staked out major trade hubs exploding any who dared try to enter or leave, sure space cops kinda swooped in and killed them immediatly afterwards, but nothing to do but Death Clone out, grab another cheap ship, head back and make the point again. Not only did the Devs get the point, it was hilarious to see the Killmails 7 jumps away and thank Baby Vorcha Jesus that none of those poor Capsuleers were me.

It has some of the best graphics and in-depth skill systems I have ever experienced, and has among the most intense player vrs player environments that can impact any level of game play.

Alternatively, the game still is plagued with a slow skill progression where every player is stressed with how to make the best use of each of their 30 day subscriptions. Although the ability to ""play for free"" is a possibility players must invest both real time and real money, often times with multiple alternate accounts, to even come close to affording such things regularly. The harsh realism of space, and the hauntily similarities of the game to real life can make EVE online a ""Real Job.""

Though the harsh reality and learning-""Cliff"" of the game can be a detractor for many that can provide substantial sense of accomplishment for those who brave it.

The new player experience is flat out horrible: I kid you not, you create your character, you log in, and you find yourself in the middle of space in a small ship. That's it. Go, do your thing. Well, thanks for nothing! Yes, the ""opportunities"" windows will keep popping up on your HUD, but that just makes matters even worse, since those are not coherent, proper tutorial missions, just a net of achievements, basically. The real tutorial missions slumber deep within the ""help"" menu, which you can lure out by pressing F12.
F12. Seriously. The quests telling you the basics of how to get around in this massive universe are in a submenu of a menu, that can be opened by F12.
And that's just the tip of the iceberg, and only a mere hint on how cumbersome and overwhelming the UI of this game is, to a point where a second display is almost a must. Somebody once said that this game is basically ""Spreadsheets - The Game"", and, well, that's what it is, really. Everything important is in tables, texts and numbers, an unholy amount of raw data and information; I swear you could play this game without graphics even being there, because you do everything by clicking on table rows. Even the combat, yes.
That's another problem of mine. If you want in on EVE for the combat, then leave now, because the combat in this game is somewhat similar to Planetside 2 in the sense of being a logistics battle instead of the battle of spacecrafts. You need a good fleet commander and do what he says, and get the right amount of ships to the right place in the right time, and that's that. It's not your skill of flying your ship what matters, but rather your skill to counter-fit your ship considering the strengths and weaknesses of your enemy. To further prove my point, you can see a lot of YT videos, where a guy fights the whole combat in his tactical overlay, which, at that point, becomes a real-time board game. Yellow dots moving to purple dots, purple dots moving to yellow dots, that's it. Does it still require skills? Yes. A lot of skills, in fact. It's just not what you'd expect, and possibly not what you want to do when you think about space combat. Probably that's where piracy comes into play, because that's a way to fight small scale fights, but without a proper manual control over your ship it's just not that exciting (yes, you don't have manual control over your ship, you approach enemy crafts by telling your ship to orbit them or keep them in range).
Oh, since we are talking about pirates and piracy, let's just mention that there are enitre corps, specializing in piracy, WHICH IS FINE! Seriously, this is a sandbox game, part of the fun is that players can be ""bad"". The problem is that the war declaration system (wardec, wardeccing, or deccing) is a piece of garbage. So what is wardec, exactly? It's a system that enables player corporations to declare war on another player corporation, meaning that they can do PvP combat even in hi-sec space, where otherwise CONCORD (EVE's NPC police) would brake up the fights and hunt down the aggressors. This sounds about OK, right? Nope. The price of a wardec in the game is about 50 M ISK. Now, to put that in context, when the game was new, a PLEX (Pilot License Extension, this is basically gametime in a box) costed about ~400 M. That means 20€ could buy you 8 war decs, right? Well, now you can sell PLEX for 1.2 BILLION, but the price of declaring war remains the same, which means that now 20€ gets you 24 wardecs. The result? Entire pirate corps (so-called ""wardec corps"") sit on trade hubs, wardeccing EVERY. LIVING. SOUL. This is like if you could, in real life, walk into the police station, give them a checque about $50, and in return they would grant your family the right to do whatever you want with another family. So how can you play around this? Well, either you and your corp move out of the trade hubs, or change regions (and believe me, hauling an entire corp to a whole other region is so fkn annoying), or you can pay the ransom, because yes, these motherfuckers usually want ransom money to drop the wardec, which is usually 100 M ISK and up. That's basically a death sentence to a new corp, so that's a no-go either. So you either jump systems over and over and over and over and over again, like space gypsies, or make some trial accounts and have some hauling alts, who never leave NPC corps (those cannot be wardecced) and do the hauling between your corp's AO and the trade hub - not immersion braking, not at all, nah.
And with that, I think we finally arrived to the whole cancer of the game: the lack of immersion. In EVE Online, you don't feel like playing a game. In EVE Online you feel like working a job. Hours and hours and hours of doing nothing but grinding, farming and running errands, fueled only by the hope of someday getting some enjoyment out of it in a form of a good ship or some nice equipment - meanwhile the market is filled with fake courier contracts, item exchange contracts and auctions, with which people are trying to trick you out of your hard earned money. The space is littered with space pirates, who are either some bored gamers looking for some fun, or actual horrible people, whose sole form of enjoyment is seeing you suffer; meanwhile decent guys roam around space like nomads, being chased and harrased. EVE is not a joyful ride in space, it's hell, a good example of what would happen if anarchy would overtake our current world; an apocalyptic wasteland, a man-eat-man universe, of which I want no further part.",1454240428,1454240428,False,19,7,0.619107842445373535,1,True,False,False

[b]Ever wanted to be the space pirate, sailing the waves of the univurse. Taking down other ships for there cargo? Black mailing them to give you a high amount of isk so you will spare there pod or even there ship? Or was your dream to make a mega corp for miners and set up a major intustry making large ships and parts for an allaince out in Null-sec? This game haves something that other MMOs dosent have yet. The feeling of total freedom. There are so many ways for you as a player to play the game. Load up on rockets and antimateria shells to take care of the pirates that have a large bounty on them and have a jolly time with your friends. [/b]

[h1] Review [/h1]

I have put in some houers into this game, ( Lies, I have put way more then just a few :P ) and I am still haveing a blast with the game. Sure it was a hard learning curve in the start and I am still learning new things still today. As they are uppdateing the game the whole time. Adding new things and fixing with old problems. So I would say that you need one or a few friends to play this game with. Or that you find a nice corp to join like Eveuni that learns out the ropes to people about the game. As it´s a huge sandbox game with a player driven market. So I would highly recommend this game to any one that loves MMOs with the element of Sandbox where you whrite your and your friends story. With good looking grafics and a good sound track to.

Stay far, far away from this ""game"". EVE is tailored from the ground up to appeal to real life losers who use EVE to ruin others' time and effort. Accept right now that as a new or inexperienced player, you are a punching bag for the amusement of roaming gank squads that venture unopposed into the most ""secure"" areas.

The complexity of this game is beyond extreme and rest assurred that its small (and growing smaller) playerbase will always know how to beat you and strip you of everything you worked to accomplish. You can't win, you won't win, and no amount of time or effort will change that fact.",1453873110,1453874811,False,1,2,0.415969789028167725,0,True,False,False

You can sit in hi-sec relativley safe and run missions, mine ore, play the market, craft things to sell, run cargo for players, defend people, explore and more. That's pretty much more than most games like this offer, and that is just hi-sec.

Should you want to be a bit more daring, earn more money, blow up some people then enter low-sec and null-sec...

This is for me where the fun is, you get all of the above and more, join a corporation, defend your systems, enter faction warfare, mine ore that sells for millions, scan down combat / data / relic sites to earn a fortune or hell monopolise the corner of a market. 

Like I said it's hard to describe because everyone has their own way of playing the game and enjoys different things.

I've tried a lot of things in EVE, some that I thought would be boring as hell that turned out to actually be really fun - This sentence has never rung more true for the actual game, I thought it would be boring but god damn I love it and every person I have introduced to it has thought the same and stayed!

Give EVE a shot, try and play with a friend or ask the amazing community in rookie help should you need any help, plenty of corps take in new players and are very helpful.

This game IS NOT free to play. This game is PAY TO PLAY

FREE TO PLAY : means you dont need a  Monthly Subscription plan to keep playing the game
PAY TO PLAY:  means YOU NEED A MONTHLY SUBSCRIBSTION PLAN to keep playing the game

 I ONLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR PLAYERS WHO HAVE A CREDIT CARD OR A DEBIT CARD other wise you WILL NOT be able to keep continue playing EVE Online after you buy one of Steams starter packs with out useing PLEX to keep your subscription active. if Your subscription complelty runs out with out buying & useing the PLEX IN-GAME to keep adding Subscription time while your subscription is still Active YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY THIS GAME ANY MORE. So if YOU DONT HAVE a Credit Card or Debit Card your just going to waste your money if you dont PLAN on useing PLEX when your Subscription is all ways active.

Here is some more usefull info about PLEX. PLEX IS A INGAME ITEM which means you can ONLY USE PLEX WHILE YOUR ONLINE PLAYING THE GAME TO ADD SOME MORE SUBSCRIPTION TIME Thats why I said  your subscription ALL WAYS HAS TO BE ACTIVE IN ORDER TO USE THE PLEX

Yes you can buy the Steam Starter packs & DLC with your steam wallet but YOU CAN NOT BUY a Monthly subscriptsion plan with it. In order to buy any sort of subscription plan to KEEP PLAYING EVE Online once your subscription completely runs out after the 1st time you NEED A CREDIT CARD OR A DEBIT CARD to Reactivate your subscribstion THATS WHY I ONLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO PLAYERS WITH CREDIT CARDS & DEBIT CARDS. 

I LOVE THIS GAME TO DEATH & really wish i can keep continue playing EVE online BUT I CANT becuase of this dang Marketing flaw That i just got done telling you all about up above. This Marketing Flaw gives players limited access for players with out a credit card or debit card to keep playing this game after you buy one of the starter packs here on steam After your subscription runs out for the 1st time.   WHICH SUCKS BIG TIME IF YOU REALLY LOVE THIS GAME LIKE I DO AND WANT TO KEEP CONTINUE PLAYING LIKE I DO.  If this Marketing Flaw did not exists ID STILL BE PLAYING THIS GAME.

Not only was I about to join the most player driven MMO that I've heard of this week, but there was even a local chat for me to meet local singles. My first thought was, “practical online dating in a space sim, what a time to be alive!”

Unfortunately, it turns out that there are less women on here than there are on Ashley Madison, which was a big shocker/disappointment. It also turns out that “local” chat doesn’t connect you with local singles, which I found to be extremely misleading. If CCP can't offer a simple dating service, then what are they doing with my $15 a month!?!? 

After receiving a tirade of angry messages from the ""locals"", I decided to jump a few systems to Uedama try my hand at mining. These CODE dicks showed up after a little while though, and told me I had to buy a “mining permit,” but I was like “fuck the police, #yolo,” if you know what I mean. That led to me dying even though I was in hi-sec, but I’ll have the last laugh since I reported them. I'm sure the GM's will do something any day now.

Eventually, I got in touch with some great people in Jita, and they told me that they would DOUBLE every single ISK that I sent their way. So obviously I went, bought twenty-five PLEX, sold them, and sent all of my money to my investment manager. He told me that because my investment was so large, it would take at least two weeks to get the funds ready. I’m anxiously awaiting my new fortune.

Anyways, I quit my job yesterday, once I realized that if I play it fulltime I can pay for the game just by playing it. My girlfriend told me that I was an idiot, but we’ll see who’s laughing when I’m a space billionaire… well, if she ever comes back.

Overall, this game is a 25/10. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who ever thought about liking sci-fi, wanted to join the space mafia, or ever owned a computer.

Update: I NEVER GOT PAID!
Update 2: After having a conversation with my investment manager, I straightened out the issue with my finances. I also got into his corporation as a low-level investment consultant. For a limited time, we can offer you a guarantee that if you sent us your ISK, it will be doubled in just one week. Convo me in Jita for details, or just send your ISK right over, you can trust us.

I read some spends Months in RL to infiltrate corporations to gain theyr trust, only to fuck em over ans steal everything they had.

Spaceships:
the spaceships have various tasps.
Some have the task of mining, and these makes stipmining in africa look like a kids sandbox, these ships can carry atleast 3 mining lazers and if you are lucky, you can make big money, if you find the right organization to work for.
NEVER MINE ALONE! OR WITH STRANGERS! if you have a good ship and want to make money.
There will be people waiting for you to shoot you down.

Other ships are cargoships/transports that transpot smaller ships inside them or from a mining fleet
You gott the fighteres and warships that does the fighting in the game

If you think thats a suicideship heading towards you, it probably will be, and you will die.

Sadly, they were wrong, and upon its collapse, those who were trapped in New Eden soon lost their ability to travel between planets. Over time, society rebuilt, and took to the stars once more.

This is where you come in. You are a new breed of starship pilot, having relinquished your humanity in favor for technological immortality through the use of clones. You can mine for much sought after resources, prey upon the weak as a pirate, become the CEO of the universes largest corporation, and much more. 

All that said, Eve online has a rather steep learning curve, and it doesn't try to hide this fact. There are also griefers, as with any mmo, that will extort you for money, and kill you anyway, there are scammers that will cheat you out of your rightful pay, and there are people who will be tacitly unhelpful on purpose. And it's all perfectly legal. 

So, while I will in fact reccommend this game to others, I will say that you will need patience, and a good dose of pure pig headed stubbornness to get ahead at the beginning. Almost every aspect of Eve can be tied to some form of conflict, even the market, which is a big part of the player run economy.

 I guess you could say in Eve Online you'll never find a larger hive of scum and villainy, and you'd probably be right. Still, if you manage to make it past the 14 day trial, and actually find something to enjoy in the game, then Eve will continue entertaining you for quite a while. Just don't expect to progress as quickly as you might in a standard RPG. 

And remember: In Eve, it isn't paranoia. There really IS someone out to get you. You just haven't spotted them yet.",1451493012,1451493012,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of my only problems in terms of bugs was in the character creation screen. It requires you to complete all the steps, and i mean ALL THE STEPS, to finish. Thats only part of the problem. When i wanted to continue after creating my characters appearance, it told me i couldnt because i hadnt selected footwear. Lo and behold, THERE WAS NO FOOTWEAR SELECTION MENU. After spending about 10 minutes browsing everything it had to offer, i had to eventually restart the game and redo the process. It worked the second time through.

Ok so i spawn in and i thought ""Wait how does this work, its all complicated and stuff and my tiny brain cant understand these complex controls that i dont know are complex or not until i finish the tutorials!"" (I said all of that out loud, alone, in my room guys. 100%.) However, the tutorial is very simple, step-by-step and thorough. Its not annoying either. Every time you complete a part of the tutorial (which doesnt take long), it asks you if you want to skip the rest. If you are new, i dont reccomend skipping.

The community, from what i have seen, is very kind (or just stays out of other peoples way). Theres even an entire chat channel called ""rookie help"" where dedicated admins answer all your questions. I found it helpful on two seperate occasions. 

There is an entire market system which is how any money you make (at least in the beginning) comes from. From what i have heard and read in the negative reviews, there are griefers who like to trash newbies ships for scrap. However, there is a VERY effective police force (at least in the gallente systems) called the CONCORD, which will effectively destroy anyone showing player-on-player violence. And there are sentry guns. I made my home station  (the station i use for buying, selling, and storage and other services) the Federal Naval Acadamy in the Duripant system. There is a large asteroid field filled with Veldspar, which i can run out and mine for about 20,000 ISK (in game money used in EVE).

However, i realize this is very opinionated, which brings me to my next point; DONT BUY THIS IF YOU ARENT WILLING TO SPEND AN HOUR OR TWO LEARNING, AND WAITING AROUND AND REPEATING CERTAIN PROCESSES TO REACH A MORE GLORIOUS ROLE. Eventually, i plan on fighting for the Gallente, but i need a bigger more powerful ship and crew for that, and those are expensive.

TL:DR; This game is perfect if you are looking for an expansive, open-universe, independent and cooperative space exploration and combat-oriented game that is playable for hours on end if you get interested. Otherwise, its probably a waste of time. Then again. you can always refund.",1451456911,1451456911,True,2,4,0.504950523376464844,0,True,False,False

It's not Star Trek.. but it may be better! Countless high detail galaxies, upgradable ships, corporations and more. The best space based game I have ever played.

This is a monthly subscription though which causes me to stop playing after my steam deals expire. 'Plex' or month subscriptions are about $15/mo.

Look to grab this game on steam for about $15 which includes a few month bundle. Play hard then disgard or subscribe.

Pros
- This is the real sandbox experience with online players.
- Lots of thing to do.
- PVP gameplay is extensive and it is the main focus of the game.
- Human controlled corporates (akin to clans or guilds) added vibrancy to the Eve online community, it enhances the sandbox experience in a subtle way.
- Ingame graphics are top-notch, stunning weapon effects, the ship models are well-designed and great eye candies in the vast lonely space.  
- Enough options for PVE at low level if new players dont like PVP.
- Probably the best virtual market (ingame, not Eve store) I have come across so far, real players and NPC simulated supply and demand make the market feel realistic.
- The game is continuously evolving and improving thanks to players' subscriptions. You could be sure it is a matured game with incremental improvements every now and then.

Cons
- Steep learning curve, lots to read up but you should have no problem if you like space games
- No grinding but 'gaining experience' can be time consuming when no means to accelerate the process without spending tons of ISK or real money
-  Unforgiving to newbies who venture in low or null sec, you will lose alot of ISK making newbie mistakes
- Limited means of control for your starships in space, do not expect to pilot your ship with a joystick like a space sim.
- Pace of game progression is slow and will get boring if you only focus on one aspect of the game. Diversify your things to do in Eve, plan out your learning programme to experience the majority of what the game has to offer.",1451140731,1451141249,True,4,0,0.568208634853363037,0,True,False,False

I first want to say that this game is kind of what you make it in a lot of instances, being that this game is largely player run. Sure you have the devs adding content, fixings bugs, and so on, but it really has been the players that make this game what it is. 

I wanted to break this down into a few sections for me to review.

PvP: I think the game revolves around PvP. What do you earn isk(in game money) for? To get new ships to shoot stuff with. Sure you can buy a better PvE oriented fitted ship but I think that most of the time in the end your going to use the isk to get involved in PvP in some way. In fact PvP is not always optional in this game which I will explain later. Anyways though like I said this game revolves around PvP. I think EvE has a unique PvP design that a lot of MMO's don't have. It's a ""if you lose it sorry but it's gone for good"" kind of game, and that's for almost everything in the game. Even items(like plex for example) that you buy with real cash can be lost and won't be refunded most of the time. You can spend 100 dollars on plex and if your transporting it through space and someone kills you and takes it, it's considered your fault and you'll likely never get that money back. I have had mixed feelings about items being bought with real cash being able to be taken by others, but for everything else it's a pretty good concept and makes the game more real. The way EvE has set this up is really important to the game and removing it would probably kill the game. It's one of the main reasons this MMO is unique. For PvP there is a variety of ships to choose from, and a lot of corps, alliances, third-party groups will often host PvP roams/fleets that you can join. I would recommend a corp that does some PvP. I recommend this and later on I will explain why. Also PvP fleets can get huge and are often exciting. A lot of the time strategy is involved and good fleet structure is always needed. All in all PvP can be really fun in this game but it is up to you and your corp to get involved in it if you want to do fleets.

PvE: I cannot say the PvE in this game is top notch. All of it gets dull after awhile and for the most part only serves the puropose to get you isk to buy new pvp ships. There is a variety of PvE activities you can do which you can look up and see which one you would like to do most to earn isk. All in all I won't go much into detail about this. The PvE stuff is just dull in my opinion and really needs to be improved more. PvE is a job in this game. If your looking for a completely PvE experiance don't come here.

Community: I feel like this will apply to all MMO's. Pick a corp/alliance(basically eve's guilds) that is active and for the most part always has players on. Make sure your first corp will be able to teach you the ropes of EvE. The tutorial does some but you will more than likely need extra help from other players to learn stuff. If you find a corp that is really inactive do not give up, leave the corp and join a better one, same thing if the players in the corp you joined are A-Holes. Also find a corp that suites you the best in terms of activities, time zone, etc. I cannot go much further into detail because it really depends on the corp you join.

Economy: For the most part the games economy is run by players. Prices can go up and down on a daily basis at times. Most of the items you buy are made by players. You can also produce your own stuff with minerals and other materials as well. Since that is is pve though that can be a grind and a job. I personally just buy things off the market. it's totally up to you though. I cannot say much more really.

Graphics: They are fair enough. Not the most wonderful thing you will ever see but it's good. Also sometimes people call the ships submarines because they act like their under water. So definitley not accurate physics. 

Skills: You are able to use new items and improve your skills through training skills. You buy a skillbook of the market and activate it. It is all time based. Skills can take weeks to train sometimes so it's wise to choose them well and find which ones will be the most useful to you. Overall i think it's a good system.

Conclusion: Eve offers a lot to do. You have many things to choose to do and it's really what you make of the game. PvP is fun but overall PvE is dull and needs work. Most people I have met are also really nice and helpful but like I said you need to choose a good corp/alliance. I have not explained everything but a lot will become known when you start playing the game. Also ask for help if you need it.

Overall I rate this game a 7.5-8/10. I do believe it is worth the sub for many reasons which will take awhile to explain so i will not right now. I give it this rating because PvE is definitley not that great considering how long this game has been out(10+ years). Also I feel for over a decade of producing this game should have more content. As in activites to do and improving PvE more which they have but it still needs work.

- And then you meet russian mafia. I guess - to enjoy this game to full extent you have to be very social - ideally play with group of friends. If you try solo, you end up dissapointed. Yes yes, you can join corp, but .. these people don't talk to each other really. It's like CS:GO but these people own half a universe and camp at all low-sec gates all day just to obliterate you. Aaand they have big big ships too. With bigger guns. 

- The game itself is very, very unforgiving. Work hard to get enough ISK to get that dream ship? Ok - you might just get it, only to see it blown up when flying out of the station you got it. True story :) You work hard to get next one .... but this time you insure it. Another will get blown up, you will get the money, but ... then you spend half a day chasing that missing equipment you lost. That brings me to my point, most of the game you travel. And it's slow. If you have time to kill, this is ideal. Everything is slow (except when you find russian mafia). One of my combats with NPCs took 15 minutes to kill single transport. I went to take a dump, only to find it's not over yet. 

+ On the other hand, level of complexity - it's just amazing. So many items you can loot and put up on your craft, I have never seen so many. And I played for a week only. And I have explored perhaps 1% of it. Maybe less. 

+ It looks good too, while system requirements are pretty modest. That's a big plus. 

- Also crashes a lot on Mac. What a shame (MacBook Pro 13, Late 2014). 

Overall: Looking back after a week of intense play (played more hours than shown here), I have to conclude that this is very very slow paced game, if you don't mind getting blown up all the time by super aggresive russians, or to travel 1 hour just to get your new missile launcher, this game might be for you.",1450648161,1450648161,False,11,3,0.547871768474578857,0,True,False,False

EVE is a little bit different than that, because it gives you more freedom to do whatever you want in the massive world, called New Eden. At the beginning of the game, you get to choose your faction. There are four corners of New Eden to choose from, each with their own lifestyle. All of these factions are at war with each other. There are many more factions in the game, however, that you can improve your standing with as you play. However, with each faction at war with each other, if you raise your standing with one faction, your standing with ones at war to the faction drop. After customizing your character, you are spawned in one of the billions of solar systems in the game with a rookie ship and some modules fitted to it. After this, you can pretty mush become whatever you want. Some possibilities include a miner, engineer, PvPer, and even a criminal. Speaking of which, there is a bounty system in the world, where you can place bounties on other players. When you start the game, the best place to start is to do some of the career missions for the path you want to take, as they will teach you the basics and give you modules and skillbooks to do it. Oh yeah, in this game, there is no XP of level up system. Instead, there is a skill system. You buy skillbooks and train them to use an item. Training skills takes real time, so you may have to wait a while until you can fly that fancy battleship you've been eyeing in the market. Modules are the items you can fit on a ship. They are things like weapons, mining lasers, and several other useful things. Every module is a different type, (high, medium, or low) and there are only a certain amount of high, medium, and low slots on a ship, along with the ship's power grid and CPU. You can also fit rigs, which modify your ship in various ways, but if you take them off, they are destroyed. This is the same with implants, which modify your stats.

[b]I can't stress enough[/b] but there is no game out there that comes even close to the feeling of grandiose and the constant peril around you like EvE. It's horrifying and abso*uckinglutely fantastic at the same time.

PvP is a core part of this game and it will happen sooner or later.

If you want to avoid PvP as much as possible - you can always stick with a NPC corporation and be a carebear in high-sec.

The training system is very different than your usual MMO stuff (no standard ""levels"" or ""classes"") and it does favor the players that have been playing the game for a long time - BUT you can be very competent if you specialize early on. It all depends on your skill - both ingame, and RL.

EVE is everything. You can make it anything you want it to be. It is the closest you will get to full freedom in a  game.

Be warned it is not for the light hearted. It takes years to learn to play it well and even then you will continue to learn.

Also be warned it takes a LOT of time. That is the only reason I stopped playing. I have never experienced a game like EVE and I don't think I ever will. I still check up on it from time to time.

There will be many dull moments to be sure. But there will be many moments that will have no equivalent anywhere else.

That's right, you can use in game money to pay for your monthly sub fee. They've been doing it for a while, and it's great. 

That being said though, money is pretty useful, and those game time tokens (PLEX) sell for a handsome margin on the market, so I can see where folks think there's a pay to win aspect to the game.

There is PVE in the game, but the developer has no sympathy for you if you want to pursue this aspect of the game.

Because CONCORD is currently broken, high sec space is full of suicide gankers, griefers, etc. Some sociopaths in the game prey on newbies for kicks despite this supposedly being a bannable offense if it occurs in ""newbie"" systems. I have reported a bunch of players for doing this and never seen any bans resulting from it. CCP just doesn't give a damn.

Low sec space is full of gankers and pirates. Null-sec space is dominated by a single Alliance. The developer has actually been caught clandestinely helping certain Alliances in the game. Considering how much Alliance equipment, stations, ships, etc is worth if their ISK (the in-game currency) cost were translated into real life dollars, the developer helping an Alliance destroy others is unforgiveable.

Because of the skill point system where skill points generate over time with no way to accelerate them other than juggling your stats it takes a very long and tedious amount of time to develop a character, and you will be very weak compared to veteran players with no way to ever catch up.

After that it's pretty much ask in rookie chat for any stuff you want to know and believe it or not. They do help unlike any other MMOs but take heart. This is eVe. not a childs play like WoW is and deff not as ugly as it. eVe is beautifull: Any Sci-fi fan should atleast try it... just looking into space or warping is relaxing... oh and the music: Fitting and awesome to eVe

There is no possible way to catch up to older players. And there is almost no player verses environment content. Eve is a massive PVP game with players either engaging in or supporting PVP battles or conflict. If you are not in pvp then there is mining, exploration, trading and production. All of these are to support the pvp battles. As a new player you will have no chance of success in pvp on your own. 


Eve's real-time leveling system means you don't have to play to level your character. It also means you can not speed up your characters training. Because of this, as a new player, you will not be able to defend yourself against an older players attack or go pvp solo. This doesn't seem like too much of a problem at first because there is almost no new player training. So, you will be spending most of your time trying to figure out how to use the game mechanics and finding the limited training available in game. In the mean time your character will be leveling skills that your not sure are right. However, there will be players chatting you up willing to teach you and even more players recruiting into corporations aka guilds. I would suggest you lean heavy on youtube videos for your game mechanics training. There are many to choose from some much better than others.


The answer the players and I guess the GMs have come up with for the new player pvp problem is that you join a corporation and be cannon fodder. It works like this. You equip your rookie ship with a device that can hold a player of any level or experience in place and then your ""friends"" warp in and make the kill. You will be killed for sure. But, that's all you can do and will be able to do for quite a while because of the training system. That's it there is nothing else you can do in the pvp area.


That leads to the other roles in the game. Mining, exploring, trading and production can be done solo. You will need to train these areas to be any good at all and that takes real time. This is where those videos come in handy. You can watch them while you character is leveling. ""that's what I did and still do from time to time"" There are also help chat channels where you can get ok advice and better resource information like what website has the trade info you can't get in game. 


The game has a lot to offer and leaves a lot to be desired. Like the lack of PVE content. There really isn't any pve content except for the professions trainers and the profession agents. They have about ten different missions at each level and they are the same no matter what race or corporation you get them from. Doing missions gets you loyalty points that are only good where you earn them. They get boring very quickly because you have to repeat the same missions quite a bit to earn enough points to get anything good. 

If your looking for a good PvE game then look somwhere else. If your looking for a good craft / farming/ grnding game its not to bad. If your looking for a PvP game to invest a lot (several months depending on how fast you figuer out what skill are needed) of time waiting for your character to level skills and trying to figure out the game itself then I guess it would be worth it. 

They say Eve is a niche game and I guess thats true. Alot of the players have spent years trying to develope their characters and don't want the game to change. The developers have done just that.

This is a post quote from a  long time player concerning the PvE side of the game. I thought  it should be added. I dont know how long it would take to get to this point but, after the initial rookie missions grinding you can do what is described below.

""1: Do missions for one of the thousands of agents in the high security systems, earning money for better equipment, rising from level 1 agents up to level 4 agents as time passes.
2: Do exploration, finding areas of interrest in the galaxy, and trying your best to exploit those areas for things to sell back at a starbase.
Mind you, there are other things to do, but these two things are what I would define as action oriented Content in Eve.
At some point during these first weeks or months, you start to figure out that there are a few more things to do, which would be the Eve equivalent of ""end game content"".
1: Level 5 missions, which is group oriented missions, using the same approach as level 1 through 4. An analogue would be ""dungeons"".
2: Incursions, which is a system wide alert, as a pirate faction moves in, locks down a system, and tries to kill everything. These Incursions will spawn areas in the system which are geared for anything between a few pilots working together, to dozens of pilots.
The equivalent would be ""raids"".
3: Wormholes. These are systems ""off the grid"" so to speak, with combat (and exploration and mining) quite a bit harder than what you would find in normal space. You could compare these to ""Elite areas"" in other games.
Keep in mind, none of what you do in Eve can be truly classified as PvE, since at any time, you can meet other players with hostile intent. It is like playing on a ""PvP Server"", with no safe zones.""",1440335937,1447517294,False,81,3,0.673142850399017334,0,True,False,False

At first I thought it would be a cool game where you explore, build, research and create. Unfortunatelly the game is populated by sociopath griefers (sociopathic game play is encouraged by the developers) and requires a matching personality to play past a certain level. Going out to low law spaces invites gangs to attack you and steal your stuff. In some case they just attack you and kill you without even looting, for the fun of killing a weaker foe. Multiplayer cooperation is allowed and this is where most the sociopathy exists, gangs/corporations/factions form that only exist to disrupt other players fun and to extort resources form them if you wish to get anything done. It was very disappointing and quite frustrating. People who play this consider it a matter of course but I think it encourages the worst of animalistic and barbaric behaviors to surface, sort of like a nation where the government fell and lawless anarchy reigns.

second thing yor whole expirience with eve is pretty much going to depend on how you aproach it.
see the thing with eve is that its gameplay really isnt anything special average at best but what makes eve so great at least for me is the people i do stuff with the expirience of planning some op with them or simply figuring out how to save the damsel the most complicated way possible just to kill some time. Alot of people search out the null sec alliances and what not when they start eve because they heard of some huge battle and want to take part in something like that now sure yeah you might find some corp thats in some powerfull alliance or coalition that will take you in but most of the people ive come across that got into some of the bigger alliances in null were just used as a suicicde tackle without any guidness or tips how to get started or how to get those shiny t2 lasers they want and honestly null sec can be a very dull place for example lets say youre just killing some rats near or at your home system to make some isk and you see 2 or 3 neutral capsuleers enter the system and youre forced to dock up because if they find you your ceo or someone else higher up in the corp is gona grind you because it looks bad on their killboard or you get into a bigger brawl and dont get me wrong those can be fun up to a point where TIDI kicks in so hard it takes you an hour to just warp to something so yeah null isnt very fun place to be at least for me and specially since CCP turned it into a tug of war. My advice for new players is to stay in hi sec dont rush geting into big corps stay in your NPC corp and meet some people hang out in factions chats and others theres some good people to meet there and read item descriptions its very easy to get around fitting your ship or figuring out how to build something just by asking someone for some help with it or just reading descriptions and checking out tutorial and try out diferent stuff and find what you like the best not what will get you most isk in certain amount of time or fullfilling someones requests just for braging rights of being in some known corp also dont aproach eve with the mindset ""oh its this huge complicated thing that will take you monts to figure out"" on contrary eve can be easy to comperhand just by reading items descriptions and pay attention to tutorial that explains some basic mechanics most of the other stuff youll either learn through trial and error or simply by talking to people now the comunity i find is one of the best mmo comunitys ive ever come across tho it has its trolls and bu++hurts and whatnot but aside from HI sec wardecers camping trade hubs and some goons theyre pretty rare. also for both new players and veterans try out roleplaying corps its quite easy and can make eve so much more enjoyable just imagine doing an op fully in character. 

Overall eve can be a great game for you or the most dreadfull one youve come across it all depends on how you aproach it really. and one last tip dont think of eve as a second job of some sort with doing multiple characters just to get that operation running on your own or depend alot on out of game information and tools one alt is all you need really just to be in the wh if youre living in one to scan your self back in if you lock your self out or something.

I discovered a few weeks ago that I could no longer log into my Account Management page on CCP's site.  This something you must be able to do if you want to join just about any decent Corporation.  I tried repeatedly to log in and then I emailed CCP's customer support with a clear description of what was happening, including screenshots.  The replies I recieved just directed me to repeat what I had aleady tried.  It was like they hadn't read the message past the Subject line. 

Their third message directed me to contact Steam's customer support for help, which I did immediately.  After a week with no reply at all from Steam I emailed CCP again.  No reply from them, either.  It's been two weeks since I first contacted CCP and I have cancelled my subscription.  At least, I've cancelled it on Paypal's end.  To do it on CCP's end you have to use the Account Management page.

I don't know they chose to ignore me.  I wasn't rude or demanding in my messages and I don't have a poor rep in the game.

This game is massive. More massive than you realize. It is complex, time intensive, and incredibly difficult and sometimes very frustrating. The learning curve is insane. I played for 440 hours and feel like I just scratched the surface. This doesn't include all the time on subreddits, tutorial pages, and info pages I spent outside the game trying to get a hang of the trading, the ships, the riggings, the different configurations, optimal ship types, skill upgrades, weapon types, planetary harvesting.... Truly an incredible game driven by a massive community unlike any other. It is immersive and the only game that has actually made me yell at my screen and have to leave the computer so I wouldn't throw it out the window. 

The people in this game have played for years and often can be vicious to new players, but if you get into a guild quickly, that pain can be somewhat diminished. It is addicting, fun, frustrating, and very player oriented. Don't think you are going to be Kirito from SAO in here, it doesn't work that way. You will die. I promise. You will die even if you are in a guild with other people.

It's hard to speak negatively about a game that contains so much, and this game is what I want every space simulator to be.  I spent hours trucking goods from one station to another, even more hours hanging around asteroids slowly mining up goods, and even a few minutes flying through dangerous ungoverned space praying that I didn't lose my ship (and losing my ship).

But if you're like me, you'll crave more of those deep space dogfights and hate the consequences of loss.  I hated the point and click method of flying a spaceship.

I keep coming back to EVE over the years and every time I quit thinking the same thing... why do I keep trying it?

It's an ironic moniker to lend to a world where hundreds of thousands of players jockey for resources, scheme, spy, and blow each other up. On that one server, wars wage in perpetuity. Scammers ply their trade outside crowded space stations. Fortunes are made and lost amid the bustle of a full-fledged economy. None of it feels particularly tranquil.

And yet, Carl Sagan once noted that from space, Earth--for all its chaos--is nothing but a pale blue dot. So it goes with EVE: step far enough back from CCP's sci-fi massively multiplayer online game, and a picture of tranquility begins to emerge. Ten years of steady growth. The recent release of a 20th free expansion, Rubicon. Throughout all, consistency of vision, commitment, and support. It's no small achievement in the winter of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game, when young games are born, live, and die, all in World of Warcraft's shadow. In the face of such competition, EVE's languid pace would seem a detriment, and yet, like the universe, EVE is ever expanding outward.

EVE cultivates an appreciation for scales, vectors, and inertia, because it makes their mastery a matter of life and death. The game supports a healthy variety of pursuits, including nonviolent options like building, trading, or mining, but at some point almost all players must hazard a jaunt around EVE's tangled network of interconnected solar systems. Each system is a room of sorts connected by stargates that act as metaphorical doorways. They're spacious chambers, big enough to fit planets, asteroid belts, and space stations with a few trillion miles to spare, but danger always has a way of finding you in EVE. If you're lucky, it'll only come in the form of pirates or warring fleets that open fire on sight. If you're unlucky, it'll be a scammer, spy, or saboteur playing EVE's tacitly sanctioned metagame against you.

Conflict runs tangential to even the most pacifistic careers in EVE. After all, it's easier to maintain a lively spaceship market if players are always blowing each other up. But when things come to blows, it's actually a tidy affair. Ships can be piloted by clicking about in space, but most actions in EVE hinge on more mechanical commands like ""maintain distance"" or ""warp to"". It's a math-oriented system that hinges on numbers like distance, radii, and acceleration. Once the enemy has been targeted and the keys for weapons have been pressed, battles ebb and flow according to who can dictate range as their ships circle. Large-scale battles are as chaotic and complex as any sci-fi war scene, and skirmishes are thrillingly staccato. Victory in either is less a product of reflex than of strategy. The prelude to war--proper equipment, communication, teammwork, and patience--is usually the deciding factor. As often as a good fight seems to find the unwilling in EVE, it can prove elusive for those seeking it out. For every minute of battle or plunder, there are hours spent as prey eludes capture, as fleets circle and dance to the reports of their forward scouts.

Indeed, EVE's pace is glacial indeed...right until it isn't. A dominant alliance might hold a third of the world in an iron grip for ages, until a spot of corporate espionage dispels it into the digital ether overnight. An interstellar bank could compound every investment it's entrusted with for years, until it suddenly absconds with billions. The universe's first Titan-class ubership may be a world-beater, until it's destroyed because the pilot chooses an inopportune moment to log off. They're the kinds of stories that make headlines outside of gaming circles, the kind that EVE is uniquely equipped to tell. Whether you're speaking to the allure of exploring EVE's vast universe, the machinations of its political scene, or even the prospects of the game's next expansion, that capacity for upheaval is a draw unto itself.

What's refreshing about EVE is how much of that change is user-driven. Player characters in the game are canonically immortal, their consciousness tied to clones that are awakened whenever they find themselves on the wrong end of the metaphorical photon torpedo. So-called pod pilots are the movers and shakers of the EVE universe, and enjoy a privileged position as mercenary demigods (consider for a moment the level of desperation that would drive a non-player character to enlist under a commander who, by definition, never goes down with the ship, and you'll begin to grasp the morbidity of EVE's lore). What gets moved or shaken is a matter of taste. It might mean battle, as a soldier or pirate. It might mean cleaning up after said battles, and pawning the salvage. Or it might mean moving goods from one place to another, and shaking whenever outlaws start eyeing your loot. Each endeavor can be pursued in the name of EVE's four hawkish NPC empires, a smattering of lesser powers, or the great host of player corporations.

Picking what banner to fly is always an important decision in an MMORPG, but in EVE, the decision can make or break the experience entirely. Should you have no allies, the vast reaches of space can be brutally lonely and unforgiving. Sure, there are hundreds of space stations to rest in, nominal communities strewn about the network of solar systems that dot EVE's pointillistic map. But though the game now allows you to walk the interiors of these structures, there's little humanity to be found inside. NPCs are still just portraits in the interface that proffer textual missions. Other players are just smaller portraits in your chat feed. The resultant sense of disembodiment impinges on every interaction in EVE, and it helps to explain the popularity of extra-game forums and meet-ups. Absent a few friendly faces, it's just not that easy to make regions with names like The Bleak Lands or Stain feel like home. Go figure.

Actually, Stain seems like Shangri-la compared to 0FZ-2H. That's the naming convention of zero-security systems, which fall outside the protection of NPC guards, and where EVE's player alliances battle for control of the game's open territories. Zero security also sees CCP's most brilliant and nefarious contribution to player-versus-player gameplay: regions, and the distribution of resources therein, are asymmetrical. Zero-sec space tempts with its more lucrative opportunities, but making the trip means leaving the safety of the empires. Inequalities exist among the lawless regions, too. The imbalance creates further incentives for players to band together, if only for the express purpose of evicting those ahead of them at the table.

Asymmetry must be in CCP's mission statement somewhere. It's certainly visible in the designs of EVE's spaceships: intricate, inventive crafts that range in scale from small yacht to small state. Asymmetry colors the use of those ships as weapons, too. At first blush, the more expensive, upper-echelon crafts seem overpowered. That perception holds true, until you develop an appreciation for asymmetrical warfare. There are no restrictions--mechanical or moral--on the size of fleets corporations can bring to the field, and with enough cheap frigates and cruisers, most foes can be felled. Barring that, there's always sabotage, as legitimate a tactic in EVE as any.

Big, expensive ships are also big, expensive targets, either for rival corporations or pirates that operate on the fringes of high-security space. Being blown up might not mean as much if you just wake up in a distant clone vat, but it can take a serious toll on your supply of ISK, EVE's currency. Ships that get destroyed are gone for good, along with all the expensive and rare equipment they've been kitted out with. That can include PLEX, an in-game item that represents real playing time in EVE (and a viable alternative to the game's $9.99 a month cost for dedicated players), meaning some losses can hurt a player's real walle",1440368420,1440368420,True,328,29,0.909668684005737305,15,True,False,False

 I would advise any new player to watch every video and read every bit of info they can to decide what they would find most appealing to them, Then read more info on how to train to be the best they can at their chosen activity.
Solo play is difficult but not impossible but the big Isk earners are in alliances that allow different corporations to work together to achieve their goals and make lots of Isk. Most of them are noob friendly and will offer advice on all aspects of the game. Don't be affraid to ask questions.
There is a monthy subsription to pay but if you work hard and put the effort in you can earn enough Isk to buy plex which you can then use to pay your monthly subscription just don't let Isk earning take over the enjoyment of playing a truely magnificent game.

Now it's much more newbie-friendly and accessable, so I can't enjoy endless weeks of slaving over a 24-hour max skill queue...

On a more serious note, it's not a first-person cockpit experience like Elite: Dangerous. This is a great game if you want a true social MMO experience with beautiful effects and systems. You can get into mining for profit if you are naturally gifted at staring at rocks for hours on end (or employ chemical help). You can troll the everliving hell out of other players, for profit, and not be at risk of being banned (as long as it's all in-game and not real life stuff). 

The true strength comes from the game's PVP and Industry structures, imo. These are the aspects that this game does well and does unlike any other MMO. The sheer options of PVP available (fleet combat, sov combat, gate camping, interdiction, seige fleets, small roam fleets, cloaked bomber fleets...) will give you no end to how to mix it up.

8500,17130132,76561198000665281,459,6,17014,0,16822,1384998756,"Let me say quite Clearly that I love EVE to death, and while I'm recommending it to practially anyone that will give me the time of day, it is not a game for the faint-hearted or the easily bored. EVE is game about finding what you want to do and then doing it, but you have to be aware that what you're going to do has been done before and you aren't that special snowflake that will do something completely innovative. At least for the first 2-3 months you can expect to be bouncing around from one thing to another trying to find what you wanna do.

The very first thing I recommend doing after you get through the super quick tutorial they give you is to do the ""Career"" missions, which are quest lines related to the most basic things you can do, you wanna fly around and shoot stuff? do the Military missions. You wanna mine rocks and build things? Do industry. Do you wanna explore space and find interesting and often valueable salvage? do Exploration. In fact, do them all, because if you stick with EVE for any length of time you're probably gonna end up doing them all anyway.

After you complete the ""Career"" missions or even while you're doing them, find a corporation (a Guild for those of you familiar with other MMOs) because EVE is not a game for playing by yourself. Yeah you can go and be the lone pirate in the lawless zones of space, but you aren't gonna last long and you definitely aren't gonna be making money that way. Corporations are groups of people that can literally be thousands of people at a time that can form or join an alliance with multiple corporations to work towards a common goal, usually to hold territory in the most outer areas of normal space, or to head into a wormhole and establish a base, or multiple bases where other people can't get to the them as easily. Corps are essential not only because EVE isn't a solo friendly game, but because you are a new player and corporations will hold at least 1 moderatly experienced player that can give you a more accurate account of what EVE actually is.

Now, while I don't have the most amount of hours played on this game in steam, I have played this game off and on since about the Empyrean Age release, which came out in 2008. So i can say with at least some certainty that I know the basics of what I'm doing. So knowing that, I will tell you that I honestly still have only scratched the surface of what EVE has to offer. I've been part of a Wormhole Corporation that was kicked out of one wormhole and had to move (which was hilarious honestly), but i've never done too much large scale PVP, nor have I really delved into industry. So look to the other reviews to see what they have to say about those things.

Don't go into EVE after looking at some videos online and seeing that bigs ships and saying to yourself ""I'm gonna fly a capital ship"" or something along those lines. It takes a LONG time to even be able to sit in a capital ship. And i stress this, to SIT in one, not fly it, but sit in it. Because you could train straight to Dreadnoughts and be able to fly around all you want but you will not have the necessary skills to be able to use anything else other than the pilot seat. My current character was made in 2011, so about 4 years ago, and i came into the game saying i wanted to fly a carrier, using my fighters to blap people out of existence, but when i got into the game and did some research, i found out that capital ships take billions of ISK (in game money) so i needed to make some. I went into mining as a newbro and tried to make money that way, i got bored of that very fast, so i teched into battlecruisers, hoping to get on some kills and get some awesome loot and joined RedvsBlue (which is a good corp if you wanna get into fights constantly but with honorable people so you don't have to worry about losing anything but your ship) and now, finally after almost 4 years of training skills (with some breaks because I play EVE and then drop it sometimes so i lost some time to train skills there) i'm finally only 11 days of straight training to be able to sit in a carrier. THAT I STILL CAN'T AFFORD! So do your research, find what level of ship you would like to fly. then train in frigates. Doesn't matter what you want to do at the begining, frigates are what you are gonna be flying for a long time unless your corp can hand out the bigger stuff. Now this all applies if you want to be a PVPer or a PVEer, doesn't make too much difference there, but for people that want to explore or mine, totally different conversation that I don't know too much about, but if you wanna do that, you can ignore this for the most part.

There are literally tons of guides and wikis on pretty much everything that can be done in EVE. So my biggest recommendation would be to look at some videos (like the wonderful trailer on the steam page), look at some different videos, because this is a very cinematic trailer and then look at wiki pages about what interests you. Because while a lot of the stuff you'll find on YouTube will be tutorials or even videos big fights people go into, you won't find everything looking only at one section of the giant resource we call the internet. look at everything you can stand to watch. and then do a 30 day trial. if you don't understand something look it up or ask someone for help. You could probably figure it out yourself but it's much easier and less frustration to go to someone more experienced that could explain it to you.

That's all I've got to say, so I hope to see you in the verse

I thoroughly love this game and how there is so much content to it you could play for years yet still there be plenty left to learn. It gives a great sense of challenge and achievement. 

If you are not very patient and find travelling between one place and another boring when there is a long time to do so then this game may not be for you as there is a lot of travelling about between locations sometimes long distances depending on what you choose to do. But since the game offers a free trial period there is no excuse in not giving a go to see for yourself.

I also love the PLEX system that is implemented where you can earn enough in-game money (although this is a lot) to be able to buy a PLEX each month instead of paying real world money although due to how much of the in-game currency is needed this would need to be a goal to work towards affording.

As for actual gameplay the mining aspect can be a little boring in the high security areas and AFK mining is often the best way to in those cases, you wouldn't want to go AFK in lower security areas as there are more interesting occurrences there. There is also a very large PVP element to this game and so many paths to follow you can get hours of fun from it.",1436276051,1436276051,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've read somewhere very good description like -  ""Is big. Really big game"" and that is totally true.
For really having feeling that you are doing something to enjoy you have to play it atleast for half an year or year to get REALLY into it! 
And when you do THAT then you can say - OMG!!! This is really freaking good game xD

Patience is key. It takes time to learn the game's mechanics. It takes time to learn the game's economy.

It's not just ok let me log in and do some ""pew-pew"" :) So if you don't have time for really get into this game,I suggest not to play it.

Be aware that it is different from WoW or other traditional MMOs where you get a small group of people and run quests against NPCS with the random meaningless PvP.  In EvE, everything minus a few basic missions are player run; everything you buy is from players, all of the space is divided up with players, and it is a brutal experience solo.  Once you experience the big fleets and complex missions, particularly PvP, it is hard to match just how intense the game is.  

There are a few hiccups though; solo playing, as mentioned earlier, is not easy or gratifying.  You will be limited to hi-sec and maybe low sec, and opporitunities will be few.  You will also feel powerless in PvP.  My advice would be to get out of hi-sec, and check on Reddit; the community in game will troll you to death, but if you are new and ask questions in game or on support community sites, people will shower you with isk and teach you everything.  I have often heard that many people quit because of the community, but that only really occurs when people try to talk tough and out of their league.

In short, try it, join a (null-sec) corp or a hi-sec ganking corp and you will learn to love EvE in no time!",1436186319,1436186319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Learning curve is hard and even though they are experimenting with tutorials and opportunities, you probably need someone to guide you into the game.

The economy is best I have ever seen in a video game, and space battles are great even though you control your ship via clicking buttons instead of a joystick.

And sometimes you wake up 3 AM just to shoot couple hours a POS (Player Owned Station) with your friends to get the phat loot.

This game is not for everyone. It doesn't hold your hand. It doesn't lead you by the nose. It does not have mercy for those not willing to put in effort to gain anything. 

Pros:
Beautiful scenery. Literal galactic vistas that can be more beautiful than your own night sky. Highly detailed ships. (So detailed you can identify what the armament is by looking at them.) VAST OPEN SPACE.. over 7500 different systems to explore and get blown up in. There is something for every play style: PVP, PVE, Marketing, Mining, Industry, Research, Exploration (that pays!), manufacturing, and even more. Constantly evolving game with direct player influence over everything in the game and a great deal of player influence on further game development. It's not, nor will it ever be, dumbed down to make it easier.

Cons:
This game is one of the most unforgiving MMOs out there. If you blow up your big fancy ship that you worked months to save up for and trained to fly.. Too bad. It's gone now. Have to buy a new one. And if you had implants, they're gone now too.  No magical respawn where you appear in a ""safe zone"" complete with your newly rebuilt ship. Nope, you regain consciousness in your home station.. Naked, and with only what's left in your hangar. Sucks to be you.
Another con.. players can be giant jerks sometimes and scamming is rampant in the trade hubs. The devs take a very hands-off approach to this. So be wary about deals that seem to good and read every detail of contracts.

I can not stress enough how much I love this game. It's not for everyone. If you played WoW or other simplistic MMOs.. this is like driving in a goKart and suddenly being handed the keys to the space shuttle. Its awesome but you have the learning curve of a baby bird getting punted out of it's nest!

For even the basic PVE content you have to have 1 scout running, your actual character, and your ""suitcase"" character, and you are disadvantaged heavily.  If you want to do it effectively you need a scout covering every route to your farming system, 3-5 working ships, and 1-2 support ships, and you also need to be paying another playergroup money to provide deeper scouting/security (ie renter corps).  Depending on what you intend to do you will need more than that, those ""3000 account battles"" you hear of only represent a few hundred players.

Yet idc about all the fluff that says will be a pleb in a corperations... seriously... if u expect to not be reimbersed for your dedication to the corperation for the unfortuant side of losing your ass, then what did u expect in a permadeath game? Minus just more setbacks worse than WoW or any other RpgMMO has done in the past... DIE lose loot, Retrieve loot! Honestly so u lost your ass, and next thing complain wanted a more quickpace arcade style of combat, sheesh can not have best of both worlds so quit crying over your discontentment on the subject.

Its a good game, heck After saying its worse than crack, apparently Never played Evercrack.

Yet i digress, i question if will even be back at current rate of progress just to join a corperation that seems friendly.. 27hrs in, purchased at first winter time sale... Read reviews from friends that said its possible to make a subscription from using in-game currency... This either forces u to ask for donations from those have ISK to spare, or Expect to fork over the $$$. Still... Making the ISK is not the problem its the dedication to be content with where it is, If get PvP killed in a low Sec area, i find that an error of judgement on your part...

Pros:
- Player created...'everything'. --From your story, to the crap you buy. There's very little that did come from the players
- Stunning graphics.
- Built for PVP from the ground up.
- Massive PvP combat. --It may be a ""blob"" but where else are you going to fight some 300 other players at the same time.
- Consequences for everything you do. --Because of the nature of this game. You can do pretty much anything to other players short of hacking their account. You can scam them, aide them, kill them. But, depending on your actions be prepared to either be praised or hunted.
- No ""safe zone"". --Well, unless you count sitting in the space station.

Cons:
- Poor ship controls. --Ships do not handle like they do in Star Trek Online
- No ""fast lane"" for character progression. --Skills are trained at a set rate that can't be hastened by actively playing the game. You could literally sit in the station for 4 years and be just as 'progressed' as someone who spent 4 years running around in the 'verse doing missions, mining, PVP, PVE combat. While many will see this as a plus. If you're looking to have your play time rewarded (ie you gained levels/direct character progression). You'll quickly be bored with this game; left with a feeling that you didn't really accomplish anything.

All in all, a very fun game to play every once in a while. And those hours of playing definitely warrant a continous subscription. I can't wait to see how this game continues to evolve.",1433049388,1433049388,True,3,0,0.482768118381500244,1,True,False,False

We get sold on this game from seeing the exciting trailiers depicting intense space battles involving dozens of ships and we imagined flying in those conflicts. This isn't a pipe dream. Newbies can start fighting PvP conflicts immediately, no matter what part of space you are in. 

Don't let so called ""newbie corporations"" lie to you and tell you that the focus of the game is running missions or mining rocks. Instead get involved with a group like Red vs. Blue, or CODEdot and start fighting right from the start. EVE Online is full of players interested in assisting newcomers and getting them up on their feet. Red vs. Blue is a group consisting of two separate corporations with a permament war declaration (wardec) between them. You can join sides and immediately engage in the PvP. CODEdot (CODE.) is an organization dedicated to changing the way high securty space functions in the game and engages in near constant PvP against large targets, like mining barges and transport ships. They take newcomers and have a blog with information on how to prepare to fly with them (http://www.minerbumping.com/p/the-code.html). 

This game has a learning curve like no other MMO out there, so getting help and reading the content on the wiki is pretty important. Do some research and make sure this is really a game for you. Watch some people on youtube playing the game, especially the PvP elements of the game they participate in. Don't expect a theme park like world of warcraft, instead, recognize that the game allows for PvP in any part of space, and you are always at risk of getting destroyed. You can come prepared and learn how to outfit your ship correctly and play strategically to improve your chances of not only surviving, but blowing up other people's ships.

Play the game and have a lot of fun. Sign up for the two week free trial and really give the game a spin. Go out, get blown up, learn, and try again. Get involved in the community, talk with others, and definitely investigate some PvP corporations.

EVE is an MMO sandbox where you can be involved with battles of up to thousands of players

·         7,548 unique characters belonging to those two coalitions participated in the overall battle (i.e. landed on at least one killmail).  6,058 participated directly in the B-R5RB system with 2,670 in system at max

·         717 unique player Corporations

·         55 unique player Alliances

Just from that battle.

To survive in EVE you need income, to buy upgrades, ships, modules, anything really, so you need a proffession. Now as i write this, Mosiac expansion was released not two days ago, introducing the Opportunites system (revamped tutorials) so whe you start EVE they will show you the basics of the basics, nothing hardcore. After this you can choose a path to proceed on, be it:-

- Exploration , wandering the EVE universe scanning down abandoned relic or data sites, or protected sleeper sites, and even wormholes, and making money off what you find in these sites.

- Industrial , from mining to building ships and components, to manipulating the markets for yoru benefits, you make money ehre by being patient and clever.

- PvE , in EVE there are still missions to do that go up in levels, if you would prefer not to PvP, and there is also Pirate (Ratting) sites where with the right friends and in the right areas, you can make a LOT of ISK.

- PvP , obvious, blow the enemy up and loot their wreck, but on the side there is also bounty hunting, while not the most productive way of making money, and usually over-looked by players, by finding the right people and putting them down you can roll in some nice amount of cash.

EVE is unlike any other MMO, as you are not told what to do or where to go, it's open, you do what you want, and one thing EVE has been applauded for is that, what you are punished for in most games, youa ren't here, it is encouraged.
You want to manipulate a CEO for months, become ""best friends"" fight side-by-side, only then. once they open up a weak spot, you take everything from them, everything from the Corporation and run with it. That is fine.

You want to get a few friends, and set up a camp on a stargate, killing anyone that comes through, it's fine.

Want to manipulate the prices of items in certain regions for your benefit, yup, it's fine. 

Obviously the specific rules still apply, like any exploits, hacks or RMT is against the rules (With some exceptions with RMT, like with selling characters, so long as it is done through the right proccess.)


But, honestly, this game is fantastic, you will make many friends and enemies, some of these may even come into your Real life. One of the best things about this game is it is a mostly mature adult community, no annoying 10 year olds or whining emo-teens. (some exceptions, but they never last long)

Why take my word for it anyway, play the game now! But don't play alone, join a corp, get contacts, make allies/enemies, play the game to it's true potential, and you will never love another game more.

EvE is an exercise in humility. If you join now or at any point in the future, don't expect any satisfaction from this game.
The trailers are made to make you believe that you can change something - the news broadcast about the battle of B-5RB are making your mind imagine things that just aren't here.
EvE is not a Sandbox - it is a multiple choice point & click adventure like those ""make your own adventure"" books you read when you were a child. There is nothing new to be discovered, everything has been done by someone before you and better to the point where it is almost mandatory to use third party websites to fit your ship, mine, produce, explore or do anything in this game.
You will not stumble upon a miner in distress in your first week and join his buddies fleet to see a large battle - if you venture into the PvP space you will be blown up either by the pirates or his reinforcements. Chatting to any of those groups will make you a target.
PvP comes in three major varieties.
Solo PvP revolves around finding a mark that you can take without any difficulties. If there is a chance that an engagement could let you lose your ship, you don't engage. For a new players this means that you will never get in any PvP you can win.
Gang PvP revolves around finding a mark that your gang can take without any difficulties. If there is a chance that an engagement could let you lose your gang, you don't engage.
Fleet PvP is just two massive blobs colliding. Most fleet battles are decided by who gets the drop on whom - since fleet battles tend to last for more than 10 minutes, a little tactics can be put into it with reinforcements.

The Sandbox that is often quoted is nothing more than a tech tree with premade options. Ships, Modules and everything you make has been made by a very restrictive system of blueprints that allow no individuality. Any two ships with the same name will look the same, behave the same and do the same until you fit them with modules with the same attributes.

So in conclusion this is EvE: You grind your ass off in the same missions or same mining belts for days on end, waiting for your skills that are based on real world time to learn to finish learning. Nothing you will do will have any impact if you haven't been playing this game for years, shelling out a quite high monthly fee for a somewhat dated game.
EvE is the ultimate in waiting simulators. Get a better game.",1428591673,1428591673,False,1033,91,0.812036573886871338,64,True,False,False

With all the other side projects the makers of EvE are doing i see only prosperity for them in the near future. 

If you are tired of the regular MMORPG, don't mind training your character skills over time(it takes time to learn a skillbook to lvl V) and thus invest quite some time to really get somewhere in the universe OR if you just like to have fun flying small craft because that can be achieved very quickly and easily aswell, then this might be the game for you and with free trials available it is very easy to experience the small craft gameplay.

I've played EVE off and on for many years now.  I have to say that EVE and one other MMO from my past(Asheron’s Call) are tied for being my most favorite MMO of all time.  It seems I only stop playing these MMOs to try other games that have come out, but then coming back to my favorites, but I guess that would be the case for many gamers out there.

COMPLEX OR SIMPLE?
One great thing about EVE is that it is extremely vast in it’s game systems, game world, play styles, and number of players.  This gives the player option of deciding how he/she wants to play.  You can play as a simple spaceship pilot, running cargo for other players or NPCs. Or maybe a mercenary helping protect an area or other players and your Corp (guild).  Maybe crafting is your thing?  Well this review could not be long enough to cover crafting since almost everything in the game can be crafted by players including starship bases!  Why not be a pirate and cruise space attacking, destroying, and taking other player’s precious cargo? You may just want to be a simple trade hub day trader and became a market tycoon.  There are so many game systems that I would literally be writing a players guide here in this review instead of an actual review but I will list just a select few features that I find myself spending the most time enjoying.

MY MOST FAVORITE FEATURES
SANDBOX - Mostly for what I have already told you in the COMPLEX or SIMPLE section above.  You have the freedom to play like you want.  Be who you want.  You travel around in solar systems and jump from one to the next.  Solar systems are huge and there are so many of them I doubt any one player has ever been to them all.  I have traveled with friends across one corner of the universe and just covering that little area of space took us over 6hrs.  Let’s just say that the game world is so vast that I’m sure most players will never see more than a ¼ of what is out there.  You can build what you want, where you want.  Of course there are rules to what can be built in certain areas.  Or you would just have a cluster of player built crap at all starter areas.  Just learn what the rules are and what skills you need, gather the items and go build!  I run 2 Minecraft servers and I have to say that Eve is still the largest sandbox game I have ever seen.

SKILL SYSTEM - Completely classless.  There are a ton of skills, I not even going to take the time to count how many there are so many I’ll just say there is a crap ton of them.  You can pick and choose which ever you want.  No skill credits to limit you.  You can literally have every skill in the game if you want.  Skill leveling is not grind based, it is real life time based.  So no more grinding away at a skill to level it up.  You just add it to your skill queue and when the time is up, it’s yours!  Since it is real time and not in game time, you will continue to level your skills even when you are not logged in.

PVP and Corp vs. Corp (Guild vs. Guild)
The PVP is great, with real consequences if you die.  You lose your ship and your cargo.  As the victor in PVP you will be able to take other players items.  Corp vs. Corp is an extremely complex and large part of this game.  Corps are constantly building and trying to acquire more space to extend their claim.  Battles can consist of hundreds of players at one time and include using the ridiculously huge Titan ships!  Go out, join a corp, get in the fleet, and go start a mega war dog fight!

GRAPHICS
Some of the best I have ever seen in any game, space or not space.  Some of the stellar views are breath taking.  You can easily get lost in the game on the graphics alone as they really do make you feel that you are piloting an actual starship in space.  Just Google ""eve online screenshots” to be amazed.
CONCLUSION
I have over 600 hours logged on steam playing Eve Online.  And this is very far off from my actual play time because I had 3 accounts several years before I ever bought it on steam.  So there are a large number of hours that would not have been recorded by steam.  I keep coming back to Eve Online because after trying new MMOs and other games that come out, I find myself limited and not being able to play the game like I want to play.  In other games I must play how the developers want me to play and progress like many theme park MMOs (WoW).   Although I did play WoW for over 5 years…  it does not compare with Eve Online simply because you can do whatever you want, where ever you want in Eve.  Go try it out, and prepare to be amazed!

Do you want a time vampire of an MMO that will ruin every other MMO you've ever played because it's so diverse and complex?

Do you enjoy player interaction in an MMO?

Do you enjoy any of the following:

- Piracy (Blowing shit up for no reason, Extortion, Scamming, Being an asshole for no reason etc. )
- Mining (Sitting in an Asteroid belt blowing up rocks while you quiver in fear, hoping pirates don't blow you up. ) 
- Scamming (Yes, scamming and thievery in this game is perfectly legal )
- 100-1000+ person battles
- 1-100 person battles
- Selling your soul to CCP
- Quitting the game a few times because of the steep learning curve
- Being a egotistical sociopath maniac when in reality, you just love Fedoras and My Little Pony
- Flying cool ass space ships
- Explosions
- A money grubbing industrial bastard looking to make ISK off of anything you can
- Playing 8 characters simultaniously
- Having a 4 monitor setup just to fit all the damn windows on your screen
- Extremely unfair fights
- Killing people in extremely unfair fights
- Spending days upon months training for skills to fly that shiny cool ship
- Getting your adrenaline pumping like no other video game
- Live in a persistant, 40,000+ system universe where anything is possible

There are many reviews out there that will give you a sense of what you can expect of the game, so I will spend my time detailing some useful pointers to those who are considering playing the game for the first time.

One thing I have to get out of the way:
______________________________
Do NOT buy any of the 'add ons' you see advertised on Steam. Anyone with experience in the game can tell you that the items they give you in the add ons are not in any way special, and even a newbie can afford these items fairly easily with money you earn in game.

Also: know that if you create an account through steam you will not be able to take advantage of buying and selling characters on that account. This is not an issue for newer players but once you are wealthy enough to be buying characters you may find it an annoyance.
______________________________

So some advice if you do decide to pull the trigger and join EVE:

- Do not consider mining as a career. It is an acceptable and easy way to make small sums of money as a new pilot, but does not lead to the type of glorious and engaging gameplay that makes EVE so incredible. Too many newbies pidgeon hole themselves into mining, this either ends in extreme boredom or unsubbing the game.
 
- Sure when you begin the game you will have to spend some time training skills and it may be a bit boring in that initial month. Do a bit of research, join a decent looking corp that does something other than mining, and have fun. This game pays off immensely for those who are patient and persistent. 

- Do not look at the capital ships and be discouraged it will take you 120 days to fly them. This is not a game where bigger is always better. The biggest ships in the game are very limited in their practical use, there is tons of fun to be had in all sizes of ships.

- Try to avoid the temptation to spend money on PLEX to buy ships you can't afford, this just makes it hurt that much more when you lose them. You will lose ships, you will feel bad when your pride and joy is destroyed. The fact that you can lose almost anything you have is a big part of what makes the game so compelling.

- If you find yourself unhappy with what you are doing or the corporation you are flying with: do something different! Join a new corp! There are TONS of different things you can do in this game, and there are groups of people out there who specialize in all of these various activities. Joining the right group can make the difference between playing for a month and unsubbing, or being happy to play the game for years.

- If something sounds too good to be true, it is. There are many scammers in the game, anyone offering to double your money is one of them.

- Do not think you are perfectly safe if you are in high security space. People willing to sacrifice their ship can still attack you. They will be dealt with by the NPC Police, but they will still be able to destroy you before that happens. Always be on your guard.

- Do not try to play this game solo. As an individual you can have an impact on the game, but you will probably not have much success trying to do it alone. Again, the social aspect of this game is a big part of its draw and having a great group of people around you to share in your successes and failures is really what makes the game so fun.

I could go on, but in short: if you like spaceships and the idea of joining a game where your ability to succeed and make your mark in the universe is only limited by your ambition then EVE is definitely for you. You will experience crushing defeats, and glorious triumphs. All of it in a universe completely run by players in a way that will amaze you more and more as you play the game.",1423137368,1423137368,True,25,1,0.717392921447753906,0,True,False,False

Ive tried WoW, Guild Wars, LoTR online and others and just never felt the call that would make me stay with it. Ive also never written a Steam review before. But this game is an absolute masterpiece of science fiction and online sandbox gaming that I feel deserves my recommendation. 

It needs to be said immediatly that this is a game that you MUST have innitiative to play. This game will not grab you by the hand and take you on a magical adventure. If you expect this, you will sit in station, spinning your ship, get bored, maybe mine a bit and quit claiming eve to be boring and for masochists. Dont do this. If you are not willing or able to put the time and effort in to learn a bit and do things without being told to explicitly, Eve may not be for you.

If you do dive into the universe of New Eden though, after completing the tutorials I have some advice. Grab your cheapest, fastest, frigate and set destination to the deepest corner of player controlled Null Security space you can and try to get there. You wont. You will explode at some point. But along the way you will learn a lot, have fun, meet people who will most likley help you in learning the game, and begin to see this world for what it is and forget about the stupid ""spread sheet simulator"" and ""i dont have a PhD so i cant play eve"" non sense.  This sort of ""lets get out there and do stuff"" attitude will lead to you creating your own stories and fun and that is what eve is about. 

The new devolpment cycle is another reason to recommend this game. Previously Eve had a bi yearly expansion cycle. All expansions free. Now CCP has moved to a 6 week release cycle (still free) that has given the game an incredible sense of momentum and constant refinement that it didnt have before. They have also doubled down on listening to community feed back and iterating on the games strengths, along with playing up the story and lore of the universe.

No other MMO has the ability for new players to become invovled in end game level content so fast. Titans (the biggest most powerful ships in the game) have been killed with the help of trial account new players. My wormhole based corp has recruited players in their first two weeks and they have thrived. A tech 1 frigate with basic skills can wreak havoc with electronic warfare modules, or tackle ships that cost literally thousands of times as it with a pilot who has been playing for years, holding them down for fleet members to blast away at them. What other MMO allows a new player to get in the face of and actually threaten a veteran player in PvP? 

One last note is, for the love of god dont try to make enough money to buy your subsription with in game money in the first few months. It will suck the fun out of this incredible experience and will burn you out. Buy ships. Explode them. Learn. Laugh. Find a good group of players to play with and do what excites you. There is literally no other game on the market like eve and you wont regret trying it.",1422677745,1422678000,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False

A great deal of effort has been put into creating a real sandbox, the market and industry/mining complexity are great. It's a shame that without maxed skills (which take years to get) it's impossible to make a profit in industry. It's a shame that without weeks of grinding for non transferable status you cant efficiently mine in a given location and its a shame that without being in the oldest and most established cliques you can't efficiently access many basic resources.

The control over space would be great for empire builders but it's totally inaccessible to anyone not in the aformentined cliques who already control all the space.

The myriad of ships, equipment and tactics to use would be interesting if it weren't for the fact that you aren't allowed to use any of them. 

Exploration would be super cool if I had the skill points to be allowed to take part in that activity.

Basically Eve has lots of cool activities and stuff but you're not permitted to do or use any of them. Everything in their trailers is there but denied to new players. Couple this to one of the worst communities in a game that I've ever seen and you get Eve. No joke the average player is a sociopath.

In short Eve isn't so much pay to win as pay to wait... wait to be allowed to play except that you pay while you're waiting. Oh and the older players who have acces to everything also make all the money which they can use to play for free while you pay for their fun.

The game is completely controlled by players in every aspect. Everyone is playing on one major server and even though that might seem like it's insane, there are times where you will find yourself all alone in the universe.

You start as a new pilot with an endless list of things you can do in the world, you can become a miner, a pirate, a warrior, a corp leader and many more. 

You can make yourself the richest in the game or just feel like destroying other people to annoy them and steal their cargo. You can build the largest corp or have a group of friends just mining and having fun.

Everything is your choice, there is something to do for everyone.

EVE is not like other MMO´s where you can just log in and play for 10-15 mins and log out, EVE takes a lot of dedication and time to master, the largest ship possible to fly takes 2 years in real time to just be able to fly and even longer to be able to use all its functions. Although your skills train even when you´re offline, if you want to be the best and the most powerful get ready to spend a lot of time in this game.

All in all a great game and a great MMO that stands out, don´t let the monthly fee scare you away from trying as you can use in game money to buy monthly game time if you are rich enough, this won't happen after a month or two, but I did make it happen after my 3rd month and never paid since with Real Life money.",1385414029,1422056087,True,644,0,0.882500767707824707,22,True,False,False

Eve is a game of niches. You start out with an overwhelming amount of possibilities; for this reason you really need to find a corp to make the game fun and find good content. Eve is all about the player interaction. And for the setting, it's hyperrealistic; there are gankers, pirates, extortion rackets, and market scammers. But there are also a lot of people willing to teach you the ropes. The learning curve is hard; the tutorials will get you out of the station, but flying with fleets and working with people will get you into the game.

There is one shard (except for China) for the whole world, so you will be coming across fleets of people from around the world. The meta-game is huge; the game has been around for years now and CCP has proven itself somewhat capable of keeping content fresh.

EVE Online where do I start with this game. EVE Online is one of those games that if you love it or hate it you will have a story to go with it. If you are thinking about getting into EVE because you saw a video on youtube or heard about a battle that caused more than a thousand plus U.S. dollars (or equal world value) and thought ""wow I want to do that too"". Well hate to burst your bubble but that does not happen alot, infact fights like that only happen once or twice a year if you are lucky. Your best bet on what your experience is going to be is that you are going to be doing your thing and then get killed by someone that has been playing the game for years. Now what you can do is join a player driven group called a corperation or corp. (FYI you will be asked LOTS of questions when your are joining a corp) When you manage to join a corp it will open up more opertunitys for you, but the main one will be the other corps that have formed an alliance with the corp that you have just joined. Then with that alliance (expecally in null space 0.0 to -1.0) will generally have a set space that they live in and fight in, but im getting to far in, lets see if I can atleast help you find a starting point. There are many things that you can do in EVE but I will try to narrow it out for you.

Some of the things that you can do in EVE is be a market traider, a miner, an industrialist, a pvp'er, a pve'er, a explorer, or a pirate.

A market traider is about as strate forward as it sounds, you would buy low sell high in stations in order to make a proft.

A miner in my oppinion is the backbone of EVE Online. As a miner what you would do is go to astroid belts and mine them for their minerals and sell them on the market. Why I call the miner the backbone of of EVE is because they provide the materials needed to make EVERYTHING in EVE. CCP does not add anything into the market in EVE except the skills needed to make an item and a BPO(Blue Print Original) of an item.

An industrialist in EVE takes the minerals that the miner has gathered and turn it into items that other players use on their space ships.

A PVP'er and PVE'er are basically the same thing execpt for what kind of enemy you fight. A PVP'er fights other Players in the game, while a PVE'er fights randomly generated NPC's (aka Rats). Both of these paths does earn you ISK (InterSteller Kredits as Scott Manly puts it). ISK has no exact meaning, its just the in-game currency.

An explorer is an interesting one. What they do is use special moduals to scan locations down and hack the location to get the items stored in it. An explorer is also the one who finds the NPC faction BPC's(Blue Print Copy). An faction item is generally better than the T2 version of an item/ship.

Now a Pirate is someone that everyone in EVE just about hates to deal with. Just as it sounds a Pirate is someone who kills players just because they can. Plus with Pirate corps they generally serve no alligence to others, one day they are fighting by your side, and the next day they are trying to kill you, but thats EVE for ya.

Now there are other things that you can do in EVE, but I tried to name the things that I think are important in EVE.

Now in order to play EVE you need a subscription, and it costs about 19 dollars (U.S.). Now you can buy PLEX (Pilots Lisence EXtenction)  though it does cost about 800 mill ISK at the time of writing this, and you do need one PLEX a month to keep your subscription going. 

Now saying if I recommend this game I would say atleast try the free trial first then decide if you want to spend money on it, and at least give it 2 or more months untill you can say if you like it or not. I mostly do PvP and it took me about 2 months untill I started to get good at it. 

You can get EVE Online on steam or on the website its self. I play EVE on steam only because it was easyier for me to pay for my subscrition, but I will say this if you do decide to get EVE on steam you will have to deal with steam sometimes not connecting to your EVE account, but with the year I have been playing EVE this only happend twice too me.

As one of my corp buds once said ""the best way to learn PvP is to fit LOTS cheap frigates and keep throwing your-self in fleet fights untill you get it.""",1420359129,1420359129,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Skill learning is REAL TIME based. On some points, it's good, you don't need to grind your skills. On the other hand, it'll take months to get decent skills, years to get good skills and you will probably never pilot one of those top-level ships (Titans).  The skill system make sure that early players will keep the  upper hand.

- To  make it worse, at a time, you could get Tech 2 Blueprints that could be used endlessly (BPO). Now, CCP switched to limited use Blueprints (BPC) that you've to research... this is great... except that they didn't remove the BPO giving once more a big advantage to older players...

-  To make a better use of blueprints (use less time and materials to produce them), you've to research them. It  takes much time (to max up a Frigate (the smaller ship) blueprint, you'll need more than a month (2x19 days).  Again,  older players have their blueprints maxxed (maybe using less time that you'll need) which means that you'll never be as competitive on the market (except if you concentrate on smaller items)

- Besides Mining and Planetary Interraction, there is a 3rd kind of ressource needed : Moon materials. Nearly all the moons that produce these are controlled by some mega-alliances which make them out of reach except by buying them (at an artificially high price) on the market. While the first materials can't be monopolized, the third one is quite limited...

- Speaking of Powerblocks... the game is controlled by some big powerblocks (big alliances)... which are quite closed... you've nearly no chance to join these which means that your impact in game will be quite limited...

- To begin the game, you've some assets (starter mission grant you a few ships and skillbooks, which is better than when the game began)... but to begin to really play, you'll need much ISK. Advanced skillbooks are expensive, same for advanced ships and equipment... which means that you'll have to grind for ISK in the beginning... Either by mining or by doing  PvE missions...

-  When you're killed, you join a new clone... Except that any implant in your former  clone are lost. You'll probably need at least 2 clones, one for learning skills (with expensive +4/+5 implants)  and one for fighting (with no  or inexpensive implants)... To be able to create that second clone, you'll need to grind your reputation (standing) with one NPC corporation... which takes time.

As you can see, there is an huge unbalance between older and newer players.... one that can never be negated (when you learn new skills, so do them, add to this advantages like the T2 BPO, Blueprint research,... As long as these are not addressed, I could *not* recommend this game to new players.

If you still want to play, here is a few recomendations :
- complete fully the  beginner's missions
- you will be able to find several places in your part of the galaxy with the same beginner's missions... this'll give you some more ships/standing/ISK which will  help you much in the beginning
- take some time mining with your Venture (you'll get it with the beginner's missions) in 1.0 or 0.9 systems (no rogue NPC) with some extra mining drones (mining->5, drones->5, these will always be useful)
- at the beginning, think about ""generic"" skills (Spaceship command,  Hull upgrades, Mechanics, Repair Systems, CPU Management, Electronics Upgrades, Powergrid Management, Weapon Upgrades, Navigation, Warp Drive Operation, Afterburners, Cybernetics (3 or 4  in the beginning), Shield Operation, Shield Management, Diplomacy,  Social, Target management, signature analysis, long range targetting,trade,...) These will be useful  whichever way  you choose to follow (Mining, PvE,  PvP, Exploration, Distribution, Trading,...) as these will increase your survavibility in space, help you fitting modules on your ship and unlock a lot of other skills
- stick  to one kind of ship : Minmattar, Gallente, Amarr or Caldari and one kind of weapon (Projectile, Hybrid, Laser or Missiles). You'll have time to learn the other one later
- only fly what you can afford to lose... Each time you  get out of the station with  a ship, you may lose it... To an NPC, to a pirate gank (even  in High Sec), ...
- Unless you're into  PvP, use implants +3 or +4  to  boost your skill learning (some mission will give you implants as rewards)
- Choose your faction... Don't do missions for Caldari/Amarr if you have chosen Gallente/Minmatar.  Try  to grind a 8.0 standing to your favorite NPC corporation (make sure it has medical facilities) so you can create a jumpclone...
- DON'T USE YOUR BONUS REMAP (well, wai for about 1 year before remapping, more bellow)

After 6-7 month (minimum) and WHEN  YOU'RE SURE ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, begin to plan your first remap. Most skills are likely to be Intelligence/Memory or Perception/Willpower. Your remap will allow to max out Intelligence or Perception, to get a decent value for memory or Willpower and reduce the other to lowerr values... So, choose which remap you'll do (ships/weapons => Perception/Willpower, production/research/electronic warfare/drones/... => Intelligence/Memory).

When you've chosen your remap, only train the skill that use the other characteristics. For example, if you decided to remap Per/Will, train Int/Mem... keep in mind that you'll keep your remap for months (matbe a full year)... this will be 5-6 month training before the remap... after the remap, only train skills related to the remap.

DON'T JUMP  TO  BIGGEST SHIPS.  Frigate/Destroyer/Cruiser/BattleCruiser,  Small/Medium weapons, only T1 ships (you may use some T2 modules, forget about faction/deadspace/... modules).  These will require  less time for the skills and are less expensive.

And, try to find a good corporation. Avoid the ""gankers pirates"", they'll lead you nowhere  and there are plenty of good PvE/PvP corporations. Don't fall to these ""lotteries"" scams or to the racketteers... Fly safe.",1420076740,1420076740,False,315,25,0.734370529651641846,15,True,False,False

As a skill based game you can do what you like - mine, build , research, run ops, spy, battle PVE or PVP. Has a excellent detailed marketplace. 

But the more advanced skills take time - there are some things that help - like attribute modifying cybernetics - but it can take weeks to get high level skills. ( skills train regardless of if you are online) This is good - no amount of money canmake someone walk in and POOF be able to fly a battleship. 

Also has innovative chracter clothing and imagery interface.  

I am enjoying seeing how game has developed. They have updates about once every 2 months so always something new. 

If you like a hack and slash beat people up do same ting over and over every day sort of game - this is not for you.  If you like an open architecture game that  can be non competitive and easy going or brutal and politcal and cut throat then join us here.

When you first join in, depending on how you are as a player it's fun to create your character, because of all the options...you also get to choose backgrounds, names etc. My only word of warning here is to not make your family name the same as your own characters name...yeah. Otherwise in dialog it ends of being ""John John"" or something haha.
When you first get into the game theres a lot...lot to read. Like a lot. For most of the beginning your reading the tutorials, though this is optional, I think it really helps. 
Once you finish the base tutorial, theres still a lot to read, but that's ok...sorta. You then get into more of your own decisions, like choosing quests, or just going whereever you wish.

From the helpful community , overall depth of game, and great friends you make playing it, it's by far an amazing experience that shines above not only other games of the genre, but every other game out there. 


[b]Having everyone on a single server lets you, a single person, make an impact on the ENTIRE gaming community. Be it through commanding a giant fleet or being the tech 1 frigate you trained into 2 hours after getting the game, you make a difference. [/b] 

There aren't any specific goals set in the game, so you'll need to make your own. Unlike most games, once you've chosen your path it will take you a while to master it. So while your skills train passively (yay no long grinds for skills!) so do your player skills. [b]I've been pvp'ing in this game for 10 months and I still have a lot to learn in JUST pvp[/b]. Not to mention the hundreds and hundreds of other non-roller coaster career paths you can take up, you will always have something new to strive towards. 

[b]You won't need to kill a wild hog 500 times to use your gear, since your skills train passively![/b]

The pvp in this game is also unreal. I've never had games consistently make my heart race like this one. Be it you barely killed a guy and you yourself only have a sliver of health left, or you just won a fleet fight where you were just commanding 50 people, and you just barely came out on top from the 75man gang you ran into! 

Just in pvp, the depth is unreal. With hundreds upon hundreds of modules, ship types, and environmental factors it keeps pvp a challenging and fresh experience day in and day out. [b]You can change your game from flying solo, flying in small gangs with a few of your bros, to HUGE fleet fights with thousands of people![/b] 

Although the learning curve is steep if you go at it alone, it's not meant to be played that way. There's nothing else like making new friends and playing through the game with a group of people you care about and smacktalk and chill on comms with. 

[b]With only a day of training - you can fly and fuck with players who've already been playing for 10 YEARS. [/b]

I highly recommend you at least give the trial a shot, and hit me up so I can give you a hand. If I'm not available, [b]be sure to stop by the channel ""R-V-B"" and join them to get your feet wet with some fast paced and heart racing pvp![/b]

Read the details below and be prepared if you want to buy the game.

[b]Preparations before playing[/b]
I know it is a game but if you don’t prepare properly, you will regret it. Or you will quit the game much earlier. A free trial for 14 days is available to anyone. Any Eve Online player can send you a link for a free trial for 21 days. You can choose to pay the subscription or enter the CD code from a starter pack at any time. Your trial time will not disappear. Your paid time will just be added to the trial time. So always start as a trial. No need to waste 14-21 days.

[b]PvP sandbox[/b]
It is a sandbox game. Unlike theme park games where gamers can interact with what developers have created to have fun, in sandbox games you have to create your own fun. The PvP (player versus player) component of the game clearly outweighs the PvE (player versus environment) component.

[b]Not a solo-friendly game[/b]
Choosing your race or bloodline is not very important. Stats are the same. Only for role players it is important. Caldari area has the largest trade hub in the game at the moment. You start the game as a member of an NPC corporation. You can join a player-run corporation at any time. Learning the game alone is difficult. Join the corporation Eve University or some other corporation that is friendly to new players. Having a mentor to ask stupid questions is very handy.

[b]Character attributes[/b]
Very important. A new character is given three character attribute remaps. You can use them to tune five attributes of your character in quite a wide range. Every skill requires a primary attribute and a secondary attribute. The amount of skill points you have in a specific attribute determines the speed of “learning” a particular skill. Benefits of the primary attribute affect the skill learning speed in full while benefits of the secondary skill give half as much speed. A new player gets two bonus remaps and one regular one. Once you spend them, your next remap will be available only one year after! These attributes are important only for learning. Nothing else.

[b]Skill system[/b]
Never train rank V of a skill unless it opens up another skill that you want. Rank V is designed for perfectionists only!
Unlike other games in Eve Online you cannot accelerate your character levelling by putting more personal time and effort into it. You can only install implants that give bonuses to your primary attributes. They vary from +1 to +5 attribute points. These implants speed up levelling. Implants + properly maxed attributes for specific skills are vital. Besides, if you buy any starter pack, you get a cerebral accelerator that gives a massive boost to attributes for a short time like 14 days (+9 to each attribute), 35 days (+3) or 7 days (+17 or 19, I don’t remember). The accelerator works for characters younger than the specified age. The effect will stay with you between the time you inject it and the time you reach that age. After that you cannot inject it.
Unless you are a genius and know the game inside out you must get the program EveMon to plan your character progression. Eve Online is spreadsheets in space and takes a lot of calculations. It is not for impatient people, who want to do everything the game has to offer in a couple of months. A properly skilled character can take a year to get.
One thing is good, however. The game has a skill queuing system. You learn skills while offline as long as your subscription time is paid. The queuing skill clearly outlines when your skills get learned.

[b]Security levels of solar systems[/b]
Every solar system has a security level. 1.0 is the highest one and 0.0 is the lowest one. The range from 1.0 till 0.5 is called highsec. In highsec space police (aka CONCORD) will interfere if you fire upon or get fired upon without a war declaration. In this space you are kind of safe. The range from 0.4 till 0.1 is lowsec. Police will not interfere although the personal security ranking of the player, who commits a crime, will drop. If it is too low, such players will be hunted down by police upon entering highsec space. 0.0 is the null security space or nullsec where no rules apply but what you make. Don’t go there unless you are prepared.

[b]User interface[/b]
The back end of the game is much more than what you are used to in any other game. You will see how much ISK (in-game currency) you spent or gained every time. You will be able to see every trade between you and some other character. Lots and lots of text. Lots of text as tutorials at the start of the game. Some people complain that it looks like you accept a lot of license agreements.

[b]Space simulator?[/b]
UPDATE http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/quick-give-me-manual-control/
Until recently you couldn't fly using WASD. Double-click on empty space and you will fly in that direction. Or choose a marker from the overview (a list of objects that exist around you in outer space, five tabs max, mind-blowingly customizable), right-click and choose Approach or Warp or something. The game has a lot of right-click and choose an option stuff. Practically core gameplay.

[b]Graphics and sound[/b]
The game was released in 2003. It has been updated since but still doesn’t look too good. For instance, with all settings on max and shaders at low it will look its best. Music is okay but I wish it had soundtracks similar to music from The Swapper. Sound effects are nothing to write home about.

[b]Game development[/b]
The game development looks slow. CCP, the development studio, seems to pool all the human resources together and then use them on various projects when a need arises. CCP has a record of promising features and not delivering them. Coming from other games where every expansion offers a tonne of content, I cannot say that Eve Online expansions offer a lot. Probably because game developers don’t stick with CCP for too long.
CCP also seems to suffer from being too ambitious and from the lack of a clear and integral vision of how their games should develop. Google “CCP world of darkness” or “CCP Incarna” to learn about the game developer’s PR failures.

[b]Other players[/b]
They are the people you will interact with all the time. They can play the game for different purposes. Beware that scamming in the game is allowed. You cannot open a ticket and get anything restored. Read what you pay for carefully.
The veteran players of Eve Online consider the game a game for elite gamers and the attitude can be felt easily on the forums. In the game the attitude is mostly friendly. However, they expect those, who want to continue playing the game after trial, to put effort and time in learning the game properly.

[b]Those, who want to play it right now[/b]
Go for it if you have a buddy in a corporation that does a lot of PvP. You are likely to participate in fights from day one. You will lose your ships a lot but the corporation is supposed (ask whether your corporation does it) to reimburse newbie ships since they don’t cost much for veteran players unless you lose the ships in particularly stupid ways.
Go for it if you are reading the text much time later and the game has improved by a lot. The things I’ve learned about the new industry UI in Eve Online in summer 2014 is a promise of a better future.",1402767203,1418940169,False,581,1,0.764928102493286133,14,True,False,False

EvE Online has a huge variety of things to do. You can mine, which means watching a progress bar counting the time until your cargo hold is full. You can produce ships, modules and ammo out of the ore you just mined, which means watching a progress bar counting the time until your production is finished. You can research ""new"" technology, which means watching a progress bar counting the time until your Incursus blueprint has a -8% bonus on material input instead of the -6% bonus it had before. You can drive a space truck through space,  which means watching the autopilot do its job and wait until the number of jumps left reaches zero. You can do Exploration, which means doing a couple of minigames over and over in bland copy-and-paste environments, but gives you some nice loot. You can join Faction Warfare and orbit around beacons in deadspace, waiting for a progress bar to fill up, telling you that you captured the beacon and got a bunch of loyalty points for it. 

Of course, other people can attack you while you do this stuff, which gives you the entertaining experience of pressing F1 and then hoping that your progress bar takes longer to deplete than the opponents'. Well, you could also run away, unless your opponent has a Run Away Prevention Thingy fitted on their ship, in which case you are screwed. But of course, that's not the end of the game. You can always bunnyhop all across the universe to buy a new ship (the old one is permanently lost) and modules for it, and only half an hour later you can be back in the thick of things and enjoy another ten seconds long fight. Maybe you will even win this time. If not, well. Just start again.

There is PvE combat as well - it's just like PvP, but without the risk and with even less variety in the enemies. It's a great way to get money and stuff, but like any good way to get money in this game, it's mindnumbingly tedious.

The learning curve is not as hard these days as it once used to be and there are always helpful people online in the newbie corporation chatrooms. That's a good thing. But still, EvE is not the most accessible of games, and every wrong decision can have permanent repercussions. There is a distinct lack of sandboxes in which people can try out, for example, how to do PvE combat without risking the loss of their ship. Every loss and every error is permanent. That's a huge part of EvE's appeal, but also a huge part of what makes it feel like a concrete wall for many new players.

EvE certainly is unique in many regards. The central cluster for everybody is an awesome thing and I wish more MMOs did that. The huge degree of persistency and player-driven politics is also certainly interesting, but it is far less appealing in the game than it sounded to me on paper. Yes, players have done great things in the game - the memorable Goonswarm / Band of Brothers wars, or some of the more famous scams. But the point is, you will likely just be a corporate drone forever. If that sounds appealing to you - go for it. If you are more interested in market manipulation than in spaceship combat, give it a try. But if you want to do awesome, memorable things in space, EvE is likely to disappoint you.

To end on a positive note - CCP has great customer support that usually responds to tickets in a matter of hours, and they deploy bugfix patches every couple of days. Many other MMO operators could really learn from that. But sadly, good customer service doesn't make a boring game any better.

I wish I could recommend this game, and I would probably love this game if the core gameplay could offer more interesting challenges and fewer boring routines. But how the game is right now, it feels more like work than entertainment.",1418921243,1418921243,False,2,0,0.489731371402740479,0,True,False,False

Of course Steam also has no want to remove a purchased item from your account either!

********************************

Pros:
1) Generally do not have to grind to level up - Perfect for working adults who might not have the time to log on as often. Set skills, goes on business trip, come back with cruiser lvl 5 trained.
2) Prepares young adults to the real world - Don't show your shiny if you don't want to get robbed. If it is too good to be true, it's a scam. Society is filled with good people, bad people and a cesspool of trolls.
3) Low computing power required - Yup, I don't upgrade my PC every year so it's nice on the wallet.
4) Beats going to the cinema - Subscription can be cheaper than an outing to the cinemas and the drama can be more entertaining. And yes, there are lasers bigger than light sabers and I count 8 colours.
5) Matured players - Yup there are immature ones but if you find a mature corp, people are generally understanding that you have real life and still play games.
6) Tight knit community - Yes, you depend on each other to survive in game and a lot of  times you do meet up in real life and make real new friends.
7) Trains you to be calm in desperate situations - Pirates, suicide gankers and bounty hunters ambush you all the time and you get surprised a lot. Your survival depends on whether you are calm and a bit of luck. Same thing in real life, sometimes you need to stay calm in desperate situations.
8) Sandbox - You define whether you've won EVE or there's just something more you want to do. You determine your own objectives and whether you fulfill them or not.
9) PLEX - If you know what you're doing and makes enough isk per month, you can basically play for free. Have its downside though.

Cons:
1) Tutorials instructions are unclear and tend to confuse new players.
2) For people who have never been robbed in their life, EVE lets you experience what it feels like to be robbed and you probably won't enjoy that experience.
3) Racketeering happens in EVE all the time where some bored veterans forces newbies to pay protection money and being newbies, you probably do not have the skills to fight back or don't know anyone who cared enough to help.
4) Burnout is a major issue, having too many things you can do and trying to do everything at once will cause burnout.
5) EVE is pretty much a true sandbox for me, one thing about sandboxes is that YOU define what is the end game. Thus this can both be a pro and a con to EVE. For people who don't set challenging or realistic target for themselves, you'll end up lost or burnt out.
6) Being able to PLEX to play is also both good and bad. People tend to spend all their time trying to hit target for the month to enjoy the game. If you cannot afford $10.95 a month, I'd advice you to go get a job first, come back when your life is more stable.
7) Doomsayers plague hisec space and newbie corps. The mere mention of lowsec/nullsec spawns a lot of negative comments that deters new players from experiencing everything.

The basic design of the game that of a box containing space with your ship and other limited objects in it that you right click on and choose an action to perform or select and click a button to do stuff too it. Despite the steep learning curve the game is very simple, in a hard to follow or understand kind of way. The hard to follow aspect is why such a simple idea hads a steep learning curve.

[b]Don't Buy the Starter Pack[/b]
It sounds like a deal, but it's not. I bought it when I originally started playing, and trying to move that amount of stuff around as a newbie is more trouble than it's worth. Go to reddit or just about any other EVE site and ask for a trial code. That will give you 21 days to test the waters free, as opposed to the usual 14. Even if you subscribe 2 days after starting the trial, You'll retain any leftover trial days after subscribing.

[b]Play Through the Tutorials, Really[/b]
Every EVE vet will tell you that skipping the tutorials is about the dumbest thing you can do. While it is a wall of text (they are fixing it...it's already better than it used to be, which is saying something), it will teach you the basics of just about everything in EVE. You'll also get a good handful of ships to fly around in and a nice chunk of money to start off with. See above - starter pack isn't worth it, and will cause more confusion than problems it solves.

[b]The Skill System Doesn't Screw Over New Players[/b]
It's easy to look at EVE's skilling system and say that it gives veterans an unfair advantage. It doesn't. You'll probably spend the first 2-3 months getting all of the ""core"" skills out of the way, during which you can still have a lot of fun and do a lot of things - a week into the game I was flying around with small PvP fleets (5-10 people) and meaningfully contributing. After the ""core"" stuff is out of the way, any further differences are on the scale of 2-5%. There's much more going on in combat that's going to dictate the outcome than skills.

[b]Bigger isn't Better[/b]
It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of flying huge ships in massive battles, but rushing to that point is the easiest way to ruin your experience. You can fly those ships around, but you will be far from effective, which is a quick route to discouragement. Start out in the small ships, learn the game, get blown up. Frigates are cheap for a reason, and new and old players both fly them more than you'd think. Most common advice for someone interested in PvP? Fit 50 cheap frigates and go get them all blown up.

This game isn't one to be taken lightly. Starting out, the learning curve is EXTREMELY steep, as it's not like other mmo's. You could argue that this game is pay-to-win because you can buy plex and sell it for isk to get the best and most expensive modules/ammunition/ships/etc. but that isn't the case. The first few weeks, you spend a lot of time getting used to the controls and the objective in the game. You have to actually learn. With that being said, the more time you spend playing it, the more you come to enjoy it.

This isn't a casual game. You have pirates, mercenaries and massive corperations run by people. The market is mostly driven by people. Most of what you will find is made by other players. On another note, the rules in EVE are also very different compared to other mmo's. You will get killed by other players, you will get killed while mining, and you will be scammed by other players. Because the game is founded upon the idea that it is player based, the common sense rules in other mmo's do not typically apply (aside from EULA). EVE isn't for those who get upset by being blown up randomly, it's for those who strive by learning how to survive. The more you know, the more useful you are.

It take's a long time to become useful. You have these things called skillbooks and skills. Before you can train for a skill (keep in mind they train in realtime and can take hours/days/weeks/etc.) you have to buy the skillbooks. But even before that, you cannot train a skill if you do not have the prerequisite skills trained. Because of this, it's useful to have a plan for the character you are training. And it is because of that, that EVE is only for dedicated players.",1418157332,1418157332,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My issues with the game where twofold starting with the afformetnioned boring that seemed to creep into the game somewhere in my final week before I would have had to throw down for a full sub, mind you for those first three weeks I was completely glued to this game. Coupled with the depressing reality that nothing I did in game really mattered as far as character progression. Since everything is queued and gains points regardless of if you are even logged in, which was sorta cool I guess but the downside was when you where logged in what you did in game didn't matter because it continued to look strictly at the queue. 

Admittedly that might have changed since I last played but if it hasn't that means if you had say (insert ship skill) queued and went hunting pirates or mining asteroids you got no increase in your weapons or mining skills because they weren't queued. Nor did you appear to get any extra points twards something that you were currently undertaking and had queued. So say you are doing a lot of fighting and had some weapons system or targeting skill queued you didn't get any bonus as far as I saw for actually doing something related to what you had queued. Which injected a certain sense of futility in doing much of anything. I mean there was always grinding for loot to grind for better weapons/ships which you can't used until you queue to train up the requisite skills and log out to let the game train while you are not playing the game.

There was also the ever present dread of being pvp fodder in much of anything you do. If that is your thing then you should probably check this out but I don't really get anything out of planning how I'm going to ruin someones day or constantly looking over my shoulder to see who is coming to brighten their day by ruining mine.

What I liked about the game: This game opened my view on mmos, and showed me not only another universe of open simulation player driven gameplay, but another sub culture of gamers that is within itself an amazing experience. Everything is player driven, with a minor role of policing by npc and occasional staff. Space combat was ruthless and lawless. Creating an empire, and conquering space is all within grasp. 

Very easy to play while working at home or multitasking, attention requirement up to you.

My experience with the community was quite up and down, the first corp (clan) I joined was run by a person who was in real life on house arrest, and quite the character - in the game he was another person, he seeked power on a certain part of space, and spent hours amassing an army to claim this sector, that was at the time lousely run by a few rogues. We fought for days, throwing resources, going back and forth - I dont think that battle ever ended, I also never heard from the corp leader again, i'm convinced he was spending welfare money on in game currency to fund the war until he lost connection. o7 

What I didn't like about the game: Hard to pick up and play with friends, required masochistic patience. The learning curve is really a brick wrapped in your child hood blanket, and it smells like daddy when he comes home late at night and fights with mom before your nightly religious talk that leaves you not sitting down the next few days, and that brick is being swung by your.. ah well you get it, it's rough.

Would I buy at current asking price of 14.99 monthly? Yup and I enjoyed the time I spent with the game

If you aren't a special snowflake and you don't take dying in a video game too seriously, you can have a ridiculously good time playing EVE without putting in a ton of time and effort. If you want to play a game where everything is handed to you, no effort is ever required, and you can pay to win, then EVE might not be fun for you. WoW is always there if you don't want a challenge. I'll go through some misinformation that unfortunately kept me away from the game for a while:

1) The learning curve is not that bad for most areas of the game. It is a huge game with a lot to learn, but it isn't ""difficult"" to learn. People just get overwhelmed by the amount of information. For me, learning about everything is part of the fun. I'm a year in and have a ton to learn, and that's a good thing. I'm always improving and learning from my mistakes.

2) You do not have to wait months to skill up enough to do fun things. You can hop in a frigate and have fun in 1000 person fleet battles in null security space on day 1. Two words: ewar maulus. The hardest part about EVE is finding your niche and figuring out what's fun for you. Some people love mining (these pople are crazy), some people love PvP, some people love trading. The people that bitch and unsubscribe after a month of mission running in high security space aren't giving the game a fair chance.

3) You can compete with and have fun with multi-year veterans. EVE is not all about skill points. They will determine how many ships you can fly, and to a lesser degree how powerful those ships are, but if you are smart and have some skill then the advantages are not insurmountable. Each level of a skill takes an exponentially greater amount of time to train than the level before it, but the benefit of leveling up does not increase. So you might train a skill to level 4 in a few days and get 90% of the bonus that a vet got from spending 20 days to train it to level 5 (max level).

4) Everyone is not mean and out to get you. Yes, if you spend $400 on PLEX to outfit billion ISK ships that you can barely fly in your first week of playing, you're going to get blown up, whether you're in high sec or not. People in local chat in trade hubs will try to scam you. Think about what you're doing and ask questions in the newbie chat channels and you'll be fine. You're never safe in EVE (what's the fun in being safe?), but if you're not stupid you can prevent yourself from being a major target. In most ships in most of high security space you will almost never just get blown up randomly. If you're having serious problems with other players in high security space then you're probably being dumb.

5) EVE is not ""spreadsheets online"". I'm really not sure where this one came from. It has kind of entered the mythology, like the supposedly impossible learning curve and everyone being out to get you. If you're a hardcore market trader or industrialist, or run a giant corporation, then you might want to keep records of things, but in no way does this define the gameplay. I suppose the inventory window is kind of like a spreadsheet because it has sortable columns? I really don't get this one.

6) Getting into a good corporation with fun people is easy. Google Brave Newbies. They are a bunch of newbies who won a 1000 person battle against a powerful group of multi-year vets this week by being smart.

Things that are true about EVE:

PvE is boring for most people and is usually a means to fund PvP. You will probably have more fun with other people than you will solo. You will probably end up with a few accounts/alts. Multiboxers are annoying, but you won't really encounter them much in PvP. The players, not the universe, make things interesting. The lore is mediocre, but null sec politics and wars are endlessly interesting. Some people play the metagame more than the actual game. EVE is challenging, but that makes it fun.",1393446957,1416347762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Eve Online is one of the most advanced, tactical / strategic starship strategy MMORPG/RTS out there, whether you prefer to fight in PvE against a wealth of AI missions, encounters, deadspace zones, or incursions of pirates swarming from the dark sector, Eve Online both rewards players for their PvE / PvP Style of gameplay. 

A True Market;

Everything in the Eve Online community, from ships, weapons, technology, research, and equipment are player manufactured, found, or created, less than 1% of items in the game are procedurely generated to assist players in their skills and general manufacturing processes. As the value of ores and materials change, so do the costs of ships, equipment and items, a true inspirational community market of unsurpassed genius and integrity. No one person dominates the the market. With thousands of places to shop, 4 player driven / founded market sectors, players will have no problems finding the resources or items they need at a reasonible price. 

Real Skills / Real Time / Real Changes:

In Eve there are no levels, there are no experience points for destroying enemy AI's or players, there is simply time and money, as you go around killing other ships and players their ingame money system (ISK) is token to you in bounties and rewards depending upon who and what you kill. Reputation is your experience in Eve, for everything you do, if felt positively in the nation you fight for, and negatively in the nation you fight against. Skills in the game drive how quickly and how effectively you use items and ships in the game. Having more than 1,000 skills, each requiring real world time to develope, but have no fear even the time you are logged off of Eve still contributes to the learning process of skills. 30 Days of Membership means 30days of Skill Training provided you log in to change your queue of skills being learned. 

Real Skills / Real Time / Real Consequences:

Skills aren't everything, how you setup your ship, events that play out on the battlefield, and the people you fly with can change everything, in Eve, even the most robust and wealthiest player can be taken down by the most noobish and uncoordinated player depending upon how you play.

Unparrelled PvP Fleets and Squad Honor:

Eve Onlines PvP Fleet / Squad System is known far and wide for its companionship, real world leaders of both men, experienced and unexperienced, leading people into the fray, giving orders and handling issues while under pressure define some of the best combat experience fleet organization and player PvP Battles you will ever immerse yourself in. There is only one rule, The Fleet Commander says Jump, you jump, and don't jump early, don't jump late, and whatever you do, don't rebel, or you'll find yourself in a pod, slow boating it back to secure space praying you remembered to upgrade your clone. 

Rating:
Not for Level Junkies, not for young players intent on showing off, Eve is for the mature, action driven player that wants to change something in the world. There is only one server and your choices are felt across it like a stone in a pool of water. Will they be good choices, or will they be bad, who's to say, join the Eve Online Community today and find out for yourself.",1416146994,1416146994,True,3,0,0.504048168659210205,1,True,False,False

If your into games that can drag on for a decade and even then there would be more skills to train. The majority of people can be helpful and somewhat nice. There are also alot of murderers and theives who will kill just to kill, deing in this game can mean losing alot of time and money. and can happen in less than 5 seconds.

It a community based and formed mmo. Even a simple and peaceful task of mining or traveling through a jump gate/ which are used for long distance travel. You can be killed by other players, its a game that will make you afraid to lose assets that take a considerable amount of time to accomplish.

If you dont have a job and want one....play EVE, you can make a career out of attempting to be one of the ones who have decent equiptment and ships and whatever else that this has to offer, which isnt much more than a ship with equiptment, money...or a ship.  

You pay 50 for the game with 2 months gametime included, then after that 15 a month if your subscribed, 20 if not. It can take over a month for one skill to train one level in that skill in higher levels. This is a huge money pit for a game that gets rather boring and repetetive after a few weeks. 

Mine for resources, chance of being killed, finally get a nice ship ya want ""made it yourself"" can be easily destroyed, or pay a few hundred million for one, which can take weeks to attain or days, after spending weeks on the proper skills and etc..

So play it if you have the time to kill, like a months worth or more to kill.

The training que has been tweeked to instead of only allowing 24 hours worth of skills (which is often in my case just 1 skill at a time) its now allowing you to train up to 50 skills at a time, (which currently all 50 skills in training on my main toon equaling up to just shy of 394 days) as in actual 24 hour days... IRL days... So yeah.

I dont know what its like to be a new pilot today compared to when i started playing but i still consider myself fairly new to the game, Although i can run an Orca with Tech II boosts i only can do level 2 security missions, The orca is an mining command ship that grants fleet bonuses to the party.

In this game  you can mine the ice fields or asteroids, attack other players, do missions which are like quests, you can harvest the resources of a planet with planetary interaction, you can form corporations and an Alliance of corporations and declare war on other corporations or alliances and be able to legally fight anywhere without police intervention.

The end game goal of the game is to be in a zero security alliance and own your own parts of space or team up with others to explore wormhole space and build your own structures at these places. At the end of your eve lifetime you could be flying capital ships or even a titan, but they take extremely long amounts of time to train for.

In this game you level up your skills with time. Instead of experience points; you get a point every second which gets multiplied by whatever your attributes are. You can use a rare remap to change your attributes to learn certain things faster than others because so many different skills require different attributes to level up faster. The lower level the skill is, the faster it is to train it, up to a level of 5 for every skill. 

Movement in this game is not WASD movement with a keyboard, you right click something and tell your ship to approach or warp to, this is how you move around in eve.

EVE Online is a rather daunting MMO, because unlike games like World of Warcraft and Star Wars: The Old Republic, EVE is an unscripted world, making players the only source of drive for the game. Personally, I think it's brilliant, because it leaves a feeling of randomness and uncertainty to the game, and outside of a few hours of training missions, it can be truly exciting to play. 

In EVE, you have the option of filling a diverse number of roles, whether you want to trade, fight, act as private security for other groups, or any number of other roles, keeping character creation feeling fresh and interesting. 

If playing games like WoW has bored you out from the same old grind to 80 (or whatever the cap is now), fetch quests, and just plain old scripting, get ready for hundreds of hours of MORE fetch quests, tutorials, and more!

Wait, no... It's an exciting world, even if it's a slow start, but highly suggested to those with the patience to experience what is one of the best MMOs on the market",1413144431,1413144431,True,6,0,0.517895936965942383,0,True,False,False

Basically it's not one single game but about 3 or 4 different. You can play it and never leave a station, just trading for hours, managing and moving goods on paper - and people do. A lot. In fact the economy is objectively the most complex in video games. On the other hand there are pvp, pve, industry, exploration and corporation management just to list a few. Take part in massive battles with thousands of players or just take of with a handful of friends and roam low security systems, do missions against the AI or mine ressources to feed the marked or the industry of your corporation. You can even play this as a quite fiddly RTS when commanding large fleets or managing your corporation as CEO. So, there really is a lot to and even after years of playing you will still be facing new challanges. If you so desire and dare to leave the beaten track that you have been following so far.
The mass of content and complexity though comes with a massive downside. It is hard to pick up for new players and I can pretty much guarantee you that you will be utterly overwhelmed at first with all the freedom of choice and the possibilities that you are offered. It's a massive sandbox at it's core. The size of Tokio and you get thrown in as a toddler with a plastic shovel and every inch of that sandbox is paved in spreadsheets.
The trick is to stay focused on what you wanna do. Pick one aspect, like small industry and producing for say, and stick with it for at least some weeks if not months. Find a corporation that shares the same focus and learn from your corpmates. If you get over this initial month or so you are presented with an increadibly rich and deep game that can keep you engaged for years and years to come withoud even paying one single cent as it is entirely possible to pay the monthly subscription with ingame currency once you get to a certain level of income.
It's a difficult game with focus on attracting and keeping hardcore players and at that definitely nothing I would safely recommend for a casual player who just wants to hop in and have some instant fun every now and then. To be successful and stay on top of things it requires quite a huge amount of your free time and a certain degree of passion and personal involvement.

To put it straight in just a few words: It is a compelling, overwhelmingly deep and entirely player driven game on a massive scale with basically no borders that unfortunately suffers from an aging and less than clear UI.

I ran missions, explored wormhole space, station trading, Industry, PI, and mining.  However, I quit because this game is very focused on the sadistic side of human behavior.  You cannot prevent someone from killing you and taking all of your hard earned stuff.  You can avoid being killed for a short time but eventually you will be eaten by the bigger fish.  This is what they don’t tell you - this game needs new blood so that the bigger fish can consume you.  As a new player you are constantly flying around in fear of being cannibalized by others.  I can understand that you are better than me and you caught me and you destroyed my ship.  However, it doesn’t stop there.  After your ship is destroyed they Pod you (and they really don’t have to do this) and you have to start all over again.  The worst part is that people are constantly trying to scam you.  They say they want to help you but in the end they take advantage of you.  This is completely allowed - The game developers say this is the beauty of the sandbox mode.  I say it is “Lord of the Flies” in space.  A bunch of kids on a deserted island and all hell breaks loose.

Sandbox mode?  Don’t think so.  How can this be a sandbox game when you are limited to where you can go, and do, as a solo pilot?  Yes, a few good people exist but you can’t trust anybody.  I live this in real life why would I want to spend my recreational time doing this?

Final note:  The game developers (CCP)  have given-up on trying to resolve the new player retention problem.  CCP releases updates that only cater to veteran players - nothing to aid the new player.  The updates aid or assist the bitter vets complaints against null-sec or capital ship issues.  CCP has given up on fixing the tutorials.

With that said, i'm writing this review after playing this game for 8 years now. 

Preparations:

This game isn't for everyone. You need to have some kind of way to deal with loss because you will loose. You will loose money, pacience, time and most of all hair!... lots of it.

Lets say after 2 months you are still playing it. you dealt with all the frustration the game brings to you everyday. You still have a steep learning curve, after that time you haven't yet scratch the surface, you are starting to read all the big battle news, and look to your ship, and its crap! 
You will need time, to learn and to train the skills, because to train the skills needed to fly and use modules, it takes time, lots of it. I don't know currently, but when i started playing to have a character fully trained you had to wait about 30 years. That doens't mean you can't have fun after 3 or 4 months.

This game isn't a simulation. Everyone thinks it is, its not. Flying ships is point and click. 
Depending of the first career path will dictate what kind of wallet you'll have in the first year, allways full, allways empty, there is not a middle ground.
Keep in mind that this game is in the making for 11 years now, you have alot of mechanics and systems that were implemented along ago. 

The market is the most powerfull mechanic of this game, just because to you have any ship ingame, someone had to mine all the materials, and built it. The supply/demand of the items ingame are very balanced, CCP ensures that their market systems are the most stable possible. It is one of the most rewarding ways to play this game, just by ''marketing''.

Combat: Refined, PVE is dull and boring like in every mmo, it have been improving in later years, but the true sugar is in the PVP part of the game. Because you can destroy someone's hard earned money's ship. It is very satisfying to see the tears after someone lost a big, pricey ship to and epic spaceship popcorn explosion. :D

Devs, updates, new mechanics: I'm yet to see a full year passing by without a major game expansion or update. This game is growing still. You have new stuff coming in almost every 6 months. 
That said, there are too many things that should be looked at. But in general the game is very stable and improving.

The 1 universe: So this game only have one server that matter (it has more, but its test and other purpuse servers). Meanwhile you have diferent people playing from diferent timezones, then you have 5000+ mapped starsystems, put 50k concurrent players, and you can have the most massive, biggest epic battles on just one place. Just because one leader woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Is that simple.

Community: One of the oldest average community i've been into gaming. Full of diplomacy, backstabbing, spying, helpfull people, crazy people.... and i think the best community of any  mmo around. 

Try it.... Lets say you like it, there are so many diferent ways to play this game, that you can even play it and not pilot a single ship..... ever. You can even be the next big spy that took down the most powerfull aliance ingame! hehe

As an explorer I live for these sites. A few clusters of abandoned ruins ripe for the picking for those with the knowledge of how to find them.  

Avoiding the High-Security systems I head to lo-sec.  The loot always tends to be more rewarding there, even with the risk of being blown apart by a fellow pilot.  I hit the system.  Afterburner on, probes launched, cloak engaged, directional scanner on full range.  The D-scan is like my little eye in the sky while I hunt down anomalies.  Anyone comes close without a cloak and I see them coming.  While I scan I see a few ships come and go. Thankfully they can't see me with my cloak engaged. Most of these guys are armed to the teeth, and I don’t even have a weapon. A weapon on my ship would be like a water pistol against these ships.  The best weapon I have is my cloak.   If I can’t be seen I can’t be shot.
Nothing good in system, just some combat sites and a lone wormhole. Combat sites would be suicide in my ship I so decide to take the WH, after all you never know what you might find. A wormhole can lead literally anywhere in the game, you might come out a few systems away or on the other side of the galaxy.  You may not even be in the galaxy anymore.

I pop out the other side and find myself in uncharted space, one of the most dangerous (and profitable) areas in the game.  I check D-scan and see one of the ships that passed me earlier, and another, and another, and another.  I run the ships against my data base to get an idea of what they’re there for.   I find an explorer (like yours truly), a weapon specialist, an electronic warfare specialist, and a cargo ship.  Four ships in what looks like a team, all after the same thing I am.  

I start scanning down the sites, hoping that I might still be able to salvage something from this.  I find two data sites.  Either one could have enough loot inside to earn me a week’s worth of cash in a single haul.  I set the D-scan to filter everything but one of the sites, and the ships disappear from the scan list.  I know that the site is safe, but for how long.  

The thing about WH sites like this one is that as soon as you jump in a timer starts ticking.  When it hits zero a large number of NPCs will jump in and ruin your day.  If you want to get anything from these sites you have to be fast.

I start on the first one I get to and it goes surprisingly easy.  All the practice in lo-sec is finally paying off.  I skirt around the various firewalls, bypassing any subroutines until I find the system core.  Five seconds later the cargo hatch pops open with a satisfying click.  Unsatisfyingly, the cargo bay only held about a million in loot, nice but only a fraction of what it could’ve been.  I risk it and go for the second cargo container, knowing that the NPCs or the other team could pop in at any moment.  I'm running D-scan constantly, but it will only give me about five seconds to prepare if someone comes my way.  I try to focus, looking at what points are most vulnerable in the system, trying not to set off any subsystems.  I slip up.  I surround myself in firewalls, no way out.  I abort the hack right before the NPC's spawn in.

With nowhere to go I cloak up and slowly work my way out of their range.  There isn't anywhere for me to jump to that I know is safe.  The only other place for me to go is a small gas site I found while scanning.  I set course, hit warp speed, and immediately remember that these sites also had high level NPCs.

My cloak is still on cool down, I have nowhere else to warp to, and I just landed in the middle of three high level NPCs.  My ship isn't built for combat, but they are.  I 'm stuck just watching while my ship is blown apart around me.  I eject in my capsule right as my (once) favorite ship is destroyed.  As my capsule is buffeted by the blast a notice pops in my inbox.  The insurance bureau is sorry to hear about my loss and have paid my claim in full.
As I write this I'm floating in my own debris field, too stupid to plan a proper escape route and too stubborn to self-destruct.  If that doesn't sum up Eve I don't know what will.

My friends called Eve ""Microsoft Excel Online"" but it isn't that bad, EVE has a very complex and layered interface it is the definition of old school mindsets for how to approach developing a PC game. With that said I did not down rate this because of the interface, if the game didn't turn me off with other things the interface wouldn't have bugged me at all, instead it became one more reason not to play the game.

The problem with EVE in my opinion is that it failed to give me the impression that I was piloting a starship or was part of something bigger and instead I felt like I was the star ship itself. There is a distinction here and with that said I could not convince myself that this game was worth the price tag.

The community for EVE is very nice from my experience and once you understand the chat interface you can meet very kind and helpful people. I have nothing to really say about the developers since I never ran into any bugs or had any complications, the game does what it was intended to do well.

I played EVE for about 3 weeks and a few months later I decided to write this review since by now I think I have an objective opinion of the game and I will present the rest of it now:

EVE has an unfun micromanagement issue where you need to travel and do essentially a fetch quest but the time it takes to do this quest can get unbarable. Worse yet at the begining you will be micromanaging just about everything so it's not like you can walk away and take a shower and stuff will get done. I got to the point where I could set AI to take care of somethings in high concord areas (Basically AI will protect me from evil players) but there is nothing fun about mining.

The next thing is EVE's character creator, it's AMAZING I really liked spending an hour making my character but afterwards there is nothing, nothing to it at all. You can't interact with NPCS because you aren't your character persay. Instead Interactions happen between ships this threw me off big time and I gave the game a chance in the hope that maybe they had plans to expand this stuff but I know of no such plans and I'm unwilling to dump money and time on this game because of it. Essentially instead of feeling like the Captain of my ship I feel like a ship.

The Music in EVE passes the time well but bring your own music because even good music gets boring after your 15th material haul. 

Eve takes itself too seriously, the game tries way too hard and consumes way too much time, while I didn't mind it at first the back and forth between areas and having to wait for 2 days for things to complete so I could use them only to find some detail that requires something else be made before I could use it  or make something from it.  To put it briefly the game does not appreciate the value of the players time and it is not streamlined to deliver it's product to the player. The result is being pounded with self imposed fetch missions across a small portion of the galaxy which can take 20 minutes to traverse if you don't get lost.

Textures are mid to low, the character textures are mid to high though, but the game graphically is not puke worthy but it doesn't get any praises from me. Space ship fights look like something you'd see from a web game.",1410109071,1410109090,False,12,0,0.473280251026153564,0,True,False,False

There are many thing you need to pay attention to in this game. That can be a little daunting to some people. I don't blame them. I was intimidated at first too. The intro is mediocre at best.

Graphically, this game is gorgeous.  From the ship textures and detail, all the way to the station lighting and captain's quarters are practically flawless.  The attention to detail in some space instances like certain asteroid belts near ringed planets is great, the rings actually move with the natural rotation of the planet.  

As far as actual gameplay goes its extremely flexible.  You can spend anywhere between 10 minutes and several hours per day playing.  Doing something as simple as changing your skills in the skill queue, or participating in a full on fleet op, or just leisurely killing rocks for resources.

I noticed the other negative reviews, but as I had no preexisting EVE account and as I was planning a subscription to handle contiuning this new account I decided to proceed.

The reason I was choosing Steam was because of the 50& off price on the Premium Pack.  For $25 a months play and a nice leg up on assets and skills.

Loaded up, hit EVE, worked through teething problems, got my charatcer on the beam with skill queue loaded up for day 1.

Went back to Steam to set up the subscription. THE STEAM STORE WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PURCHASE AS TO PURCHASE THE EVE SUBSCRIPTION I NEEDED TO OWN THE STEAM EVE STARTER PACK.  THIS IS EXPLICITLY LISTED AS PART OF THE PREMIUM PACK.

Until they fix this coding problem I cannot subscribe. Submitted a tech support Ticket. Until I hear an answer back I am reluctant to invest time in a game that I might need a refund on.

The skill system is based on real world time so even if you don't have hours to dedicate you can still progress.  Most low level skill advance pretty quickly adding new abilities and skills and allow you to test different paths.

It is an unforgiving world where mistakes have a high price.  If you bite off more than you can chew and stick around longer than you should, you'll find yourself without a ship.  In Eve; when your ship is destroyed, it is gone.  You become a pod and can flee.  Your POD can be killed so flee quickly.  If you make it back to a station to can outfit a new ship and head out to try to salvage some gear from your reckage (loot your corpse).  Some item will be completely destroyed, but you can typically find some equipment you had.

This make exploring very thrilling and risky.  You'll love this game until you get ship you've invested everything into blown up with no hopes of salvaging anything, then you'll realize not to invest everything into just one ship.  Take my advice or learn the hard way.

it doesn't worth 6$ even w/o subscribtion. 15$/m is insult.

From a graphical standpoint, the game is very nice. Ships are detailed and impressive, the factions are varied to an extent. For example, weapon types vary between the four, though that really doesn't matter much as you can use any ship and weapon if you train the right skills. Skills take real time to learn and there are a fair number to obtain before you can be reasonably capable of operating even the most basic ship types effectively.

Where the game trips is the actual game play. Doing anything in the game takes long periods of time - from earning ingame currency to performing any action like mining, production, etc. We've all seen the videos of massive wars being waged in the game, but this is the exception. 99.93% of the game has zero action - it's been called a spreadsheet simulator and that is fairly accurate. Even that is a bit of a misnomer as even this component is more tedious than it need be. Hell, I'm a CPA - my entire worklife is spreadsheets and I find the tedium ridiculous in this game. It is quite telling when just about anybody that plays EVE will admit that they play other games WHILE playing this one. That is not exactly a glowing recommendation for the game.

The only fun to be derived is from the player corporations (and associated meta-game) and ganking people for their goods. For the anarchist out there, that sounds super and for them, if they can stand the tedium that comes with it. For the rest with a semi-neutral toward good alignment, ths game is only an exercise in tedium and frustration.",1407597140,1407597140,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Do you know that feeling, when something gets under your skin so badly, that you can't help but want it more, and more?  For me, EVE Online evokes that feeling, which either raises really weird questions about me, or points out the nature of this game.

The devs have done a wonderful job in smoothing out the early learning curve, which was a main frustration point for new players. Sure, it's still steep, but now if you can learn to read, the game actually teaches you the basics. Emphasis on ""the basis"". The game is still far, far away from holding your hand, which I do adore.

However, the game is still [i]extremely[/i] harsh when it comes to penalties. Most of the major penalties can be avoided to some extent; insurance will pay for your ship if you're blown to smithereens (you still lose your junk on the ship, though), having an up-to-date clone will prevent skill loss (you still lose your implants). Death IS essentially just a slap on the wrist... If you make sure that your backup assets are sufficient, and active. Otherwise... Well, I hope you enjoy sitting in your rookie ship again.

The skill system is still as in-depth as it always was; the metagame is still as enticing as it always was. You are, as always, free to pursue whatever path you desire. There's no such thing as an unviable playstyle.

... Just remember that at the core, this game is still about people.

-This game is a HUGE time sink. The whole purpose of this game is to remove time from your life (you could be doing other things than playing this game).
-This game has a subscription fee - money that could go towards a gym subscription instead. You look like you need it, fatty.
-If you want an action-packed space adventure, then this is not the game for you.

Alright so now that I've cleared the air, it's time to begin my review.

This game is awesome. I'm enjoying every minute of it. If you have the patience to understand what each icon on your left does, then you'll have a fun time playing this game. The game relies HEAVILY on time rather than on grinding. You know those annoying facebook games that require you to log in every once in a while to do something? That's pretty much this game. Surprisingly that's not a bad thing. Here's why:

The reason this game is fun is because of the way the in-game world works. You can be anything and anyone you want. If you want to be an explorer, a pirate, a stock trader (yes there is a complex stock market in this game), a bounty hunter, a soldier, a corporate leader, a miner etc; you can be that. This game is a sandbox, but it still has enough barriers to regulate the game so everything doesn't go into haywire.

The galaxy is massive and there is ALWAYS a fight happening somewhere. You could be in a quiet corner of the world, but someone, somewhere else is being raided by pirates. If combat is your definition of fun, then this game is NOT for you. If economics & politics are what you want, then this game is indeed for you.

It's complex enough to weed out the lesser-minded proletariats so that you may enjoy your brief impact on the in-game universe.

Do I recommend this game? Hell yes. It's one heck of an MMO and I can't believe I hadn't played it before. I'm an MMO veteran, mind you and I've played EVERY single MMO out there be it free or not.

Such as there was something called ""Burn Jita"" or some guy stole massive amounts of ingame money from players by a bank scam. You may hear about how difficult and unforgiving this game is with players killing for fun. All of this is true and so much more. EVE is not your standard MMO. 

     First off, I'll cover how you can continue your subscription. You've probably noticed the subscription plan, something called PLEX and you may have heard of the fact that you can eventully not pay at all for subscriptions. The subscription plan is self-explanatory, you can figure that out, it costs less per month the more months you pre-purchase. PLEX is a very interesting option though, you'll notice that it costs more than a subscription and yet all it does is add 30 days. There's a very good reason for this, PLEX is a sort of commodity in game, a very ,very valuable commodity. As in, it's not unheard of to get a billion ISK (Roughly $30) for selling one of these things though you're looking closer to 700-800 million for the lower priced ones. This means two things, players who need a boost in credits have an option to sell in game time, players in game who succeed financially will be able to effectively keep their accounts alive without having to pay real money. Now, I know what you're thinking, Pay to Win! This is not as true as it might seem. The reason is that in terms of what anyone would really deem ""Financially successful"", this 1 billion ISK isn't that difficult to earn if you know how. It also doesn't get you far unless you know how to play at whatever it is you choose to do. Lastly, players trying to use real world money to get in game credits are paying not only subscription costs, but added costs for these PLEX cards. They're really just designed to give you a relatively small boost, not fuel the next war machine or your capital ship construction project.

     Gameplay, where do I even start? First off, there's no classes. You can freely do pretty much whatever you want to do as the devs believe in emergent gameplay. You probably think this means pirates who kill for fun are allowed, well yes but there's a lot more. Remember that ""Burn Jita"" I mentioned? That was a single player who made a group and they planned to change the game. There's a trade hub named Jita, it's the biggest of the hubs and it was getting to where you had to sell certain items at certain prices as you would either get massively undercut or make less profit and not even hurt the people charging more. This player got his group to target and destroy massive amounts of goods going through the system, forcing players to direct economic flow to other systems, making the market fluid again. Players took to the forums, complaining about the trillions in damages suffered, guess how the devs responded? They were actually told about it beforehand so they decided to beef the servers up so players wouldn't have to deal with lag. That's a rather grand example though. There's a lot more opportunities to do what you wish. Want to be a miner and stay in a high security system? No one's stopping you, have fun. However, if you want the really high value goods, get a corporation together and head out in to the dangerous null sec, basically meaning that there's no police protection and if you die it's your own fault for not being prepared, the wild west of space if you will. You can join in wars, manage supply chains, colonize planets, transport goods across the galaxy, pirate, kill pirates, kill people who kill pirates, explore hidden sites in space, be an industrialist, play the markets, just make something up! The two week trial gives you a feel for the atmosphere of the game, I reccomend just buying one month on a subscription plan, this will let you delve deeper in to the game and try to really find if this is for you.

     In short, this game is supremely complex, the learning curve is high, the rewards for surmounting it higher, this is one of the very few MMOs that I can honestly say were worth every dollar. Before I forget, there is a real money paid for currency. I haven't really dealt with it, as far as I'm aware it's just cosmetic stuff so you're character can look more imposing in that portrait. I can't garuntee you'll like it, I don't know what kind of person you are, I just believe that it's worth trying before scrolling on to buy the next first person shooter that really is different this time.",1406237623,1406237623,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- You can play EvE how you want to. You could be a trader and do nothing but play the markets, you could join a corp and battle for player controlled space, you could become a pirate and rob unlucky travelers, etc. Unlike most other MMOs where combat is pretty much the end all be all, in EvE you can make the game experience what ever you want it to be.
- EvEs economy is extreemly deep. Where most MMOs barely have an auction house, EvE's market is a sizable chunk of the game. Players make and sell the vast majority of items in the game, and there's thriving markets for arbitrage.
- You don't have to play 40+ hours a week to make progress. Everything you can do in EvE is based on your player skills (and how much cash you have) and these skills train in real time even when you're offline. This (in my opinion) puts all players on a more even footing as to what they're capable of. You can play a massive amount if you want to, and you may make lots of money in the process, but it won't get you to the next level faster than the casual player who's on less than 10 hours a week.

Cons:
- EvE has a massive learning curve, much steeper than any other MMO I've played.
- Most missions in the game are terrible. They're highly repetitive and mostly boring as hell. Not to say that missions are really a draw of the game though, the vast majority of the content is experienced by making your own way through the universe rather than having some NPC hand you a map and instructions.
- The game in general can get very boring over time. I've been subscribed several times over the years but 4-8 months at a stretch is about all I can take before I find myself just logging in to queue up more skills. EvE can be lots of fun, but it's never been all consuming for me like some other MMOs such as WoW.

Overall I'd recommend giving EvE a try. It's certainly not for everyone, but the sheer sandboxiness of the world makes it unique among MMOs and worth at least a few months of your time.",1406153065,1406153065,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's one of those games with a notoriously high learning curve, but a curve that recently has been smashed down a bit. Once a new player gets the hang of the possibilities, this game can become the single most stimulating gaming experience one can have. 

I've always been one for politics. Making deals and decisions that can affect the course of history. Youll often hear about Eve's completely player run economy, but what i find most appealing is the politics. Alliances of thousands of players controlling vast expanses of space, hundreds of trillions of ISK(Interstellar Kredits) worth of assets, all with the ability, no matter how small an alliance, to take what was once a quasi-stable political map and turn the entire universe on its head.

There is much to do in New Eden. Explore the stars discovering ruined stations, derelict ships, criminal outposts, and rogue drone hives. Become a marketing tycoon and corner the market in a region. Build planetary industry and manufacture components by the millions. Mine asteroids, build ships, work for police or pirates, be a lone pirate in the dregs of space or join a massive alliance and fight battles amongst the largest monstrocities of warefare humanity ever created.

Now for the less biased review:

Eve is a 3rd person cinematic spaceship combat game, market and politics simulator. You pilot your ship by giving commands either by designating targets and clicking the ""orbit at X km"" command or ""approach"" ""warp to"" etc. When i fist signed up way back when i was under the impression it was a flight sim, in-cockpit type game. It is not. Even so, this game is absolutely beautiful, with breathtaking scenery, explosions, gunfire, missile flares, just everything.

A major con with the game of late is that a large portion of new players have taken up scamming as a profession. CCP, the creators of Eve, have always encouraged emergent gameplay, allowing anything that can be done without violating the EULA. Creating elaborate scams isnt condemned. As such it's very easy for new players to fall for any of the hundreds of scams created of the last 11 years Eve has been out (at time of writing). 

As a new player, dont do anything in game you wouldnt do in real life. Dont give anyone a loan unless you trust them; dont follow strangers to areas youve never been to before; and if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.

So long as you follow those rules, you should have quite an enjoyable experience.

While massive wars over territory and resources do occur, along with other epicc occurances, they tend to be few and far between, and ultimatly fairly pointless as again what is resolved largely comes down to the player community and how it reacts. If your interested in solo, or small group, play there is comparitively little to do as the major focus of the game seems to be on large scale guild or in EVE terms ""Corporation"" gameplay. Due to the politics paranoia is rife as well which can make forming connections and getting in with a good group difficult. What's more the game is totally infested with scammers, and newer players are among the favorite targets, although scamming and conning has become such a part of EVE that you see people largely making a joke about it and sitting around all day in major hubs like Jita claiming that they will give people 10x the amount of money back that they are sent. 

 This is not to say EVE is a ""bad"" game but it's one that I can't recommend in a general sense because it's not for everyone, it has a long-lasting, and enduring community, one of the longest ever, but it's not something I think the typical gamer will find a lot of pleasure in which is why despite the length of it's existance it's never achieved any kind of massive popularity on the level of Everquest, or World Of Warcraft. 

 If you play EVE expect a steep learning curve, and a decent amount of frustration, should you make it past that initial obstacle, the biggest question is of course going to be what group you get into, and how good you are at making your own entertainment in terms of setting your personal goals and striving to meet them, as they game is not going to present much in the way of quests or a storyline in the style of other MMOs.

Everything in EvE takes an incredible amount of time, either you put in the time and effort and become attached or like most people you just walk away because as a GAME EvE is not fun.  EvE simply becomes exciting when you start having things to lose.

Long version:

EvE Online is more of a Fishing+Poker+Spreadsheet hybrid than a game of spaceships.  You usually have to endure hours of mind-numbing boredom to be rewarded with brief excitement.  The boredom can come from grinding away to have a little bit of income or from enduring 30+ 1-minute long warps across nearly identical - boring - solar systems.  At some point you'll finally have some things in the game that you feel attached to and then it becomes PvP......it's still like fishing but now it has poker elements.....you have something to lose and something to gain and other players are trying to outsmart you.....well, outsmart you or they've been playing for 10 years and a loss is so insignificant to these players that it's essentially win-win for them because they stand to lose .00001% of their wealth to you and that's worth any excitement/potential tears they can get (They'll always have a better hand and more of them and all the chips, good luck!).

Anyway, spreadsheets!  EVERYTHING you do in this game is a spreadsheet with a space backdrop, most folks don't even recognize that there is a view of space.  Want to be a trader?  You dock in a station, open 2 or 3 spreadsheet views and spend all day staring at them, right clicking your orders and increasing them by .01 isk and then having 4 other people immediately up you by .01isk.  Want to run missions?  The spreadsheet is now a list of objects within about 400km of you, CTRL+Click the red things and click your gun icons then let math decide how much damage you do based on range+tracking speed+ a bunch of other things that you can enable as columns on your spreadsheet.  PvP combat?  Yup, just like mission spreadsheets but now you open an additional spreadsheet called the d-scan that shows you items >400km away so you can see what's coming to blow you up!

That's pretty much EvE summed up.  Yeah, you can make some friends and run a corp......or through 5+ years of effort you could be part of leadership of a sizeable alliance but that's just more spreadsheets with the addition of PR work.  They could call it real life simulator spaceship edition.",1406086251,1406086661,True,4,0,0.56813657283782959,0,True,False,False

Eve Online is the ultimate timesink and not in a bad way. If you have nowhere to go during the day or friends then absolutely put down you hard cash and give it a whirl. I would actually really recommend this, it kept me sane during my last period of unemployment.

Because this game is at the point to where now it takes months/years to do anything that has any impact on the living universe. You can have your own little fun doing small missions and mining ore and killing AI, which really is all fun and immersive, but the fact of the matter is that if you come into this game now, you're already too late and the train has left the station a long time ago.

The main reason I don't recommend this game is because of the leveling system. ""Skills"" aren't necessarily skill-based (though you will need to practice various ship ""maneuvers""), but merely time spent on downloading knowledge into your mainbrain (a la Matrix) so that your clone can use different ships or weapons. The higher the skill, the longer the wait, the better the payoff.

I stopped my subscription after realizing that maxing out the ships and guns that I wanted to play would take about 3 years. Granted, the ships, guns, and modules that I wanted to use were more advanced, but as a gamer and as someone who enjoys stacking numbers in my favor, I didn't like the fact that I would have to play sub-par until my abilities were maxed out. Nevermind if I had any skill with a ship or was clever at manipulating the market; because of the lack of maxed skills in my prefered style of play, I wouldnt' do as well.

If I had joined this game five or six years ago, I might feel a little differently, but after investing eight months into the game (two months just to get the slightest idea of what I would have wanted to/could do), I realized that taking so much time to make any kind of impact on the community as a player (not as a person, as I've met some very nice people along the way) wasn't very attractive to me.

All in all, as a game, I loved my time in EVE online. I might have even stayed if there was a cockpit. The complexity of ship loadouts, the vastness of space, the epicness of battles (that I've never participated in), the realistic flow of economy, it all coalesces into a great experience...for someone who was there to board the train early.",1406051633,1406051633,False,433,2,0.746495902538299561,21,True,False,False

It shouldn't have to be said that a love of space, spacehips, and fantasy in an MMO make EVE a perfect fit for you, but it should be said that the universe is only the framework - it is the individuals, your alliances, the friendly deals with corporations and the open acts of war with another coalition that drive the content of the game, everyday. EVE Online is not for the immature audience. Though the immature type has been known to find a place in the circlejerk of griefers and gankers that is found in New Eden, it is those with true-life skills in leadership, strategy, distribution, espionage, intelligence, diplomacy, education, industry, and philanthropy that make up the bulk of the universe.

I am the only gamer girl in my clan, and it is totally worth it ^.^, this game is not for the feint minded, it requires you to actually spend time training in skills and learning the concepts of the game; But once you do the rewards are endless. 

it is a massive sandbox world with 7,500 star systems and hundreds of thousands of players to encounter. you can make friends and form alliances together or make enemies and watch their ships explode as you destroy them in fierce battles, or watch your ship explode if your skills are to low ^.^...

 The world of eve is treacherous but yet very friendly, you can take up roles of whatever you want and you are not bound to them at all if you want to hide in low sec and kill capsules as they are passing through your system you can, or if your a brave bounty hunter you can hunt pirates or earn your isk by ratting in low or null sec, or even if you want a peaceful break from combat you can switch from your combat ships and pilot one of you mining rigs to harvest minerals to sell for isk or save for the blue prints you just found exploring the deep darks depth of space for; and use those minerals to build that advanced ship or fittings that would benefit you alot. 

Training is relatively easy depending on what you want to train in, you can always allocate your points to the primary attribute that skill requires to shorten the training time it takes for your character to learn that certain skill. You can also become a good enough player to use in-game money to buy plex that you can then use to extend your monthly subscription... my first month was the free 30 days from steam then i bought 1 month from the eve account management site which is cheaper... and my third month i was able to use in game money to pay for my subscription, and at this time i learned enough skills to do level 4 combat missions with diffrent corps and by myself to earn 50 - 200 million isk per run. 

The rewards of isk only become better as the risk becomes greater... you start in high sec where ccp forces are protecting you then there is low-sec, null sec, then deadspace , and wormhole space... i love wormhole space the graphics are beautiful ^.^, but my friend's pos (player owned starbases) that helped transport materials to build was attacked and destroyed o.o... but that is eve ^.^, and when you start you get an attribute boost that increases your attributes dramatically and allows you to learn skills faster for two weeks ^.^, lol i forgot about it until i was 2 weeks and a day into the game so i couldnt use it, and sold it for 300 million isk, which enabled me to buy my first battleship The Abaddon. 

Learning skills for ship piloting is also very easy you buy skill books with isk and it could take 5 to 7 days to learn skills from frigate to a battleship as a new pilot, but only a few hours if you keep playing for experienced players with im only 3 months experienced and i have 2 battleships and love helping new pilots ^.^... Also the economy is completly player contolled so you can be a trader and become the richest person in eve just by buying low and selling high... I think if you search this video on youtube (EVE Online Inferno | Official Trailer HD) you will fall in love instantly ^.^...  and i will also post a link on my profile page to give you a 21 day trial instead of 14 day trial... and you must buy through steam for starter pack and you will be able to take pictures to share, because the graphics are just stunning... so see you soon, and remember ""With risk comes Great Rewards in the world of Eve"". ^.^",1386658789,1405319390,True,20,0,0.624201357364654541,7,True,False,False

I cant recommend this game. it is a profound time sink, and has a really niche player base with very little payoff for more casual players. I played for about a year and i found myself waiting for the game experience to become fun, but it never did. the space combat is unforgivably boring, which as far as im concerned is a deal breaker. 

the ship designs are bizarrely ugly too, and it constantly tempered my desire for new ships. i care less about aesthetics than combat, but playing this i was forced to stare at my ship for virtually the entire playtime, so i would have been happier if i actually liked how my ships looked. 

the skill system was pretty much hands-off, you just had to wait for hours or more commonly days or even weeks to get a miniscule increase to a particular skill, and it never felt rewarding to max a skill out, just on to the next skill, a numb grind.

i realize that many people would cite the massive battles that occur as a counter to my assertion that the combat is boring, but these huge battles are infrequent at best, and due to the in-game economy being so closely linked to real world cash value, these battles could very well cost you more than a few wrecked ships. most of the time youll be battling human or a.i. controlled pirates/bandits in small time skirmishes that serve only to highlight how uninteresting the combat usually is.

 i keep a book by my computer for when im downloading programs or whatever, and i found myself rereading the entire Song of Ice and Fire series while engaged in combat or mining, both primarily rely on the same skill set of moving the mouse icon and occasionally clicking buttons. 

i also grew to mistrust the company CCP and the community of this game, although im sure there were lots of decent human beings amongst them. the biggest problem i had with the community happened when i first started playing. the leader of one of the most prominent corporate alliances had shown up to a livestream drunk and called out a player by his real name and asked his followers to grief this poor, totally innocent guy. the leader said during the livestream that he wanted the player to actually commit suicide irl, and the big bad leader was marshalling his ingame forces to ""make it so"".

this despicable behaviour was reprimanded with a slap on the wrist, a mere 30 day suspension from their little ingame council, and as far as i know, nothing more was done.

 there seemed to be a lingering resentment towards players who choose to pve or mine or whatever, and i read more than a few forum posts that were more like essays on how the elitist players are right in how they grief players who choose to mine, likening them to worse than mindless drones that deserve to die over and over. it felt like i was reading the manifesto of a sociopath, rather than a reasoned sensible opinion.

I'm going to start by saying that EVE is legendary for being unique. Not only due to its Learning Cliff, but also because of its Gameplay, Systems, & the fact that it's likely THE most authentic Sandbox MMO currently in existence (at least Sci-Fi Sandbox, if not overall). As such, with this game, you're going to either feel immediately at home, or you're not, in which case you're going to struggle for a while, only to end up quitting quite fast.

As such, before you buy, I truly recommend you get yourself a 14-day Free Trial Account first, before you potentially waste money on EVE. It's simply not for everyone. Even if you adore Dark Souls & worship its PvP, EVE might still not be the game for you.

One of the major hurdles you're going to face, apart from the Gameplay, Systems, the User Interface etc, is the Subscription - much like all Sub-based MMOs, you're going to need to constantly justifying spending the necessary quid each month to keep your Account active.

Some people criticize the Sub Model, saying it's outdated, others feel the game is too old for this, but I prefer to see it like this: EVE provides all of its content, all of its updates free of charge, minus the necessary monthly Subscription Fee.

Most Games launched at the same time EVE was look like they're stuck in the '90s. EVE doesn't. Not only does it look Visually stunning due to the continuous Graphical Overhauls (DX11 features are on the short list right now!), but it also keeps things fresh with constant Updates. CCP has actually just switched to a new 6-week Patching Cycle which will deliver more content, faster than ever before.

Of course, like any game, EVE does have downsides:  The User Interface is like 2006 Burning Crusade (for those of you who played), & Development is slow, but it is steady at least. Much like any other Game, the Community varies beween total assholes to campers, stalkers, gankers, griefers, haters, trolls, to extremely friendly blokes that actually want to help, to people who run Corporations dedicated to training Newbies in the various Career Paths that New Eden has available to you.

Speaking of; there's a multitude of Careers to choose from in EVE, you don't need to necessary do PvP (which can vary from Fleet-sized fights to small Gang-sized encounters to 1v1s), or PvE (which also varies from Exploration to Missioning to Incursions (Raids, specifically, Rifts), to Wormholes).  You can just sit in one of the 4 Major Trade Hubs (Jita being by far the most popular), & Trade items on the market all day long, making Millions. You can jump into Wormholes & live isolated from the rest of New Eden in your own secret corner of the Galaxy, fight for your Empire as a Loyalist in Factional Warfare (PvP), or become a Conqueror of Star Systems with an Alliance of like-minded psychopaths looking to seize the Player-Controlled Regions of New Eden (known as Null-Sec) for themselves (with a bit of backstabbing, lying, deceiving, stealing, bribing, & blackmailing involved along the way), etc.

In EVE, Progression is different, unique even. In many MMOs, you train (read: grind) to the Level Cap, max out some 2-3 Professions & you're done. Then you just bang your head against the wall when it comes to the Content itself until it keels over & delivers ""epic lewtz."" In EVE, Training can last for months on end until you finally have the Skills you need to fully Pilot that epic Battleship you've been drooling over for months - especially the Pirate Faction Ships, which have higher requirements, tied to higher Damage Output, etc, so when you do finally undock that sweet Beast, you feel like you've accomplished something amazing, you've achieved something that so long ago seemed impossible, even.

The revamped Tutorials help make the transition from your standard VG into EVE a lot smoother. Just a few years ago I made a Trial only to barely get past them. Now, I picked up EVE again over the Steam Winter Sale, & my experience was far smoother. I ended up clocking over 50 hours into it in just the first week alone.

That's not to say the Legendary Learning Cliff is gone, no, it is still very much there, & the EVE Community works hard to ensure it remains there, even while helping newbies overcome it. Rather, the Path leading to the top of the Cliff has been worn smooth by a decade of Capsuleers that came before you, but the ""Jump Here"" sign remains, waiting for those who wish to escape the madness of New Eden.

The Tutorials used to just drop you into the massive, gaping pit that is New Eden, now, the transaction is smoother. Needless to say, Combat is still unique, & takes getting used to. The game still stands out from anything else, BY FAR.

Oh, & the EVE Starter Pack is extremely handy for newbies. In short - recommended, but only after you do the Trial & see if you're actually willing to spend money on EVE.

There are so many ways to play and so many things you could do for self-fulfillment that I really can't condense the hundreds of possible job descriptions into a single review, but I'll give it a shot.

Combat in EVE is, to say the least, hectic. Fleet Commanders scream over interlinked third-party VOIP systems while using whisper keys to intercommunicate while commanding the attention of a thousand or more nerds flying a swarm of spaceships ranging from billions of ISK cost to tens of thousands while attempting to organize tackle [or stuns] squads, anchor and lead the swarm so that they don't get separated or cut apart, and manage the overall damage output of the fleet onto primary, secondary, and tertiary targets in the enemy fleet. All while staying alive themselves, and all while using a few keyboard hotkeys and VOIP.

From a fleet member's perspective, you're either healing or dealing damage, and your given set of third-party comms may be two hundred people screaming or ten pilots sitting in complete silence waiting for the order to drop bombs dealing hundreds of thousands of damage per second into the heart of the enemy fleet passing silently around you, unaware of your cloaked presence. Your client could be coming to a crawl or your computer could be exploding if you're running multiple accounts in the same fleet and it struggles to render the thousands of units on screen.

As for the actual combat itself, it's basically just some math. Certain factors like tracking speed of turrets, signature radius, and locking speed are taken into account to determine how quickly you can deal damage to the enemy and how effective that damage is. Damage types allow for specialization against certain ships, and certain ships allow for unique counters to specific fleet metas that given alliances may or may not choose to adhere to. 

Single-ship combat is effectively an algorithmic back-and-forth of damage per second and shield/armor/hull recharge per second, and who has the damage output to overcome the threshold more quickly.


---


From an industrial perspective, you may be quietly spending the hours alt-tabbed while a heavy miner vaporizes rocks and pulls in the yield... Of course, if you're into more specialized industrial pay, you could run cloaked blockade runners through enemy lines to steal from an orbital station that a spy gave you the access codes to, in exchange for a cut of the profits. You could also hectically follow the massive blob of nullsec fleets into battle, waiting patiently until they leave to salvage the corpses of massive capital ships and more literally the corpses of players on the field, who may be or become famous, playing a part in a massive body-trading underground that collects, trades, and pays for corpses of a particular type.

For some, EVE is all about living in New Eden. They prefer the escapism granted to them through the video game medium and enjoy making highly detailed characters with relatively massive autobiographies. They spend day-in-day-out while logged in treating the game like a roleplay simulation engine, maybe engaging in tense and [to some] extreme political talks negotiating a takeover of another Alliance's space, maybe just using their roleplay persona to spout memes from a given television show and naming all of their frigates after Starbuck's raptor. 


---

Even still there are those who prefer the solitude of deep space in New Eden, and pass quietly through the thousands of systems discovering Easter Eggs meant for players and traveling to places nobody else has ever been, anchoring canisters named after them or leaving enigmatic messages for any who might choose to follow in their footsteps.

--

You may be part of a fifteen thousand man Coalition, but in the downtime between wars you may prefer the casual comfort of station trading and manufacturing while watching films and talking with your corporation-mates about life and their problems with nullsec freighter work. You may even just want to play dubstep, watch giant space fights in game, and livestream popularized EVE events so that others can view them from the safety of their browsers and donate to your subscription fund!

The thing I love about this game is the amount of detail involved in almost everything, and keeping track of everything and preventing information overload can be challenging.  This game can only be recommended to the experienced MMORPG players in the crowed, and at that not to ones that have played strictly care bear types of games.  By background was from Everquest pre care bear days, back in the late 90's and early 2000's when dying meant you could lose all of you stuff.  That is an important distinction since in Eve the exact same can happen but with even worse odds of not recovering your gear.
In Eve your ships can get very expensive very fast, faster than the isk curve can keep up with.  Most will just buy a couple plex which they exchange on the market for the in game currency isk which is used in all purchases on the in game market.  This will allow them to fund one or two characters for the first little while to get the needed gear, unless you like grinding the old fashioned way for isk.  Most new players though will have issues with this since they want to get into the action right away, that just usually does not happen, unless you have connections already in the game world.
The learning curve is another element of the game that puts most people off, it is with out a doubt the worst in any game ever, yeah including old EQ.  You will be spending long hours reading forums and wikis trying to glean out every last bit of information that you can, especially after losing a few ships and wondering what is wrong with your fits.
And keep in mind after the 21 day free trial your now paying for the privelage of being all the older players favorite new ganks, because that will happen unless you are lucky enough to fall into a good player run corp.  If you are an experienced player and love having to live a game in order to be in the top and receive the just rewards then this game is for you.

1) The skillpoint system. While it is true that new players may never accumulate the same [i]total[/i] number of skillpoints that older players have, everyone can gain the skillpoints necessary to fill a particular role exactly as well as those old players can. Age allows you to branch out more expertly, but a level 5 certified Interceptor pilot will get the same results with their ship whether their character has 5 million skillpoints or 150 million. And for people with limited play time, there is no fear of being left behind by those who would otherwise ""grind"" their way to the top in a traditional MMO. The system has it's good and bad points, so it's really better to think of it simply as being [i]different.[/i]

2) The players. EVE encourages competition at every level, in every aspect of the game. This naturally makes people competitive outside the game as well, on forums, blogs, and news sites. This is not meant as an excuse, merely an explanation, as to why EVE players seem more monolithically hostile. Whatever you do in the game, there are almost certain to be other players trying to beat you at it, which makes finding the right people to play with far more important than it is in other MMO's.

3) The combat. I can only echo [url=http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/26v2lr/the_review_of_eve_thats_marked_as_the_most/churpxi] the rebuttal linked here,[/url] and say that if you find the PvP combat boring, you've never actually experienced it. To this day no other game has given me the same sort of adrenaline rush you get when your ship is on the line in EVE and only your skill at piloting can win the day.

I recommend this game for a particular kind of gamer. EVE has a rich history, a strange fabric, and a thick shell, and it's rewards are consummate with the amount of effort you put into walking your own path through it's universe.

The thing about EvE is that it's more about you making goals for yourself instead of trying to get the game find you some linear goal, the reason for this, is because in EvE you can do a LOT more things you could imagine to being able to do in other games, and there are too many ways of earning your way through the EVE universe.

In the beginning you can surely let the game just throw the missions at you but rather sooner than later, you are better off trying to do some of the things that is more about you exploring space or finding some weird way of making isk, while you skill up to some special ship you may desire, or reaching a set point.

The game doesn't need you to play all the time, which is actually where the real skill time trainer helps a lot, also in forcing you to plan ahead instead of instant gratification. And makes coming back after not being able to play for a week or two, have your character(s) beefed up some more.  :P

I might as well get this out of the way:

EVE really isn't a video game. It's more of a second, virtual life.

It's notorious for being difficult and having a steep learning curve, and as a life-long gamer (super nintendo days), I think that's pretty much true. It's information overload in the first few days of play. That being said, CCP and the EVE community have done their best to make the game accessible and playable to the average gamer. The tutorials are decent, and there are a multitude of FAQs, wikis, reedits and youtube videos on the web for those looking and willing to learn more about the game. It's a game of patience, but it can also be really fun. 

It's a sandbox, so you get what you want out of it. EVE has gotten some mainstream coverage for its epic fleet battles (at 4 FPS, mind you), but that's really only one aspect of the game. As a player you can explore, mine, hunt pirates, go to war, trade, build etc. It's really up to you: if you want to be a lonewolf and never have to interact with anyone, you can do that. If you want to join a corporation (clan) and do things with other people, you can do that as well. 

EVE is obviously a very well-made game, but I think the real gem behind its success is that it has one of the most supportive gaming communities in the world. Sure, there are always going to be trolls, but from my experience so far, a significant number of players in EVE are genuinely nice people, who enjoy and love the game and are willing to help noobs out (though they will not hesitate to blow your ship up, given the chance). I can't stress how refreshing and cool that is.

As for the costs, don't worry about the subscription too much. It can be paid for via in-game money, which you earn by doing stuff in the game such as missions etc. If you really want to play this game for free, all it takes is some time. 

If you bypass steam, there's currently a 14-day free trial on EVE's own site. Try it out. If it's for you, it's for you.",1400051416,1400051416,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Is it very complicated? Yes, very! However giving the game time to explain itself to you, contacting the various player-run corporations and receiving help and training makes the learning curve more of a gentle slope than a cliff.

What is enjoyable about it? Well firstly it looks incredible, its software and graphics have been updating to keep up with modern hardware and the game runs beautifully and looks even better. Secondly the combat is so very tactical that you really can't get a feel of how complex combat scenarios are until you are in command of one, ie try it! Thirdly you have the sandbox. Full-blown economic sandbox with empires rising and falling, constant conflict and intrigue within the massive playerbase. Simple put: Fun and satisfying combat along a large-scale universe-wide simulation.

Progression?
Contrary to how it looks, progression is measured in the skills your characters learns. These skills are learned in real-time whether you are on or offline. You need to always be learning something! Ships are bought and lost, but yuor characters remains permanent (well, sometimes he gets a little roughed up..).

E.V.E Online is a shining example of what an MMO can be. It has the deep skill and trait system with the open sandbox modern MMO's lack out right or fail to achieve in execution. Its well rounded and got a very social and skilled community. It's still going incredibly strong given its age and the Developers work tirelessly to add in new content on a shocking huge basis. They are keeping large aspects of it updated with modern gaming as well. Not over looking any aspect of their game engine. Its one huge server fitting 10,000+ daily average active players with little to no-lag. 

E.V.E Online is space based Pvp at its best. Yes, There are no manual dog fighting FPS style controls here but once you get used to their control system you will notice that less and less as you get drawn into the E.V.E gameplay. E.V.E works on a traditional stat and trait system not all that disimilar from older MMO's like SWG (Pre-C.U/NGE). This mix of skills and traits combined with your ship, ships bonuses and the equipment you choose to slot effects what kind of role you decide to play. 

Needless to say the many menus, massive game map, dozens of factions, ratings, reputation let alone the controls are pretty staggering at first. But you eventually find yourself growing comfortable with them.

In E.V.E Online you can really do anything you can think of if you work hard enough at it. Are you the lone gun for hire jumping from system to system looking for work? Maybe your a power hungry warlord after total galactic domination? Or maybe your a Bounty Hunter searching for that right sum to retire on. The options in E.V.E Online are pretty vast and there is definately somthing for everyone.

The tutorials ease you into the basics and are a lot better now than they used to be.  Do them all, don't miss any and at the end of them you will have some useful skills, more skillbooks waiting to be activated and a few frigates along with a destroyer if you complete the advanced combat tutorial.  Also, don't skip the mission text.  Many new players get stuck because they couldn't be bothered reading.  After the tutorials take a breather, relax, sit back and really think about what you want to achieve because specialisation is key.  If you want to make millions as a miner then take the time to look at which ships are specialised for that career, what skills you need to fly it and what skills you need to equip it correctly, like the ability to control drones etc.

The most useful piece of advice I can give is to find a good corp.  Don't be shy, put yourself out there.

But, man does break your spirit sometime :P.  It's not a game for the faint of heart or who like to lead by a carrot on a stick.

They give you the freedom to build empires but expect you to figure out how gather the resources, how use them, and how keep them safe as the game won't do any of it for you and you can't do it alone either so trust plays a large role as well.

So who this game is not for.
#1 Solo players.  You'll probably end up feeling like you're never getting ahead since to do a lot of things you'll want people around you or even need them.
#2 People who need direction.  While you can get it you have to find it first.  The game does some simple tutorials of a lot of the paths in the game but then basically lets you go of the bike for you to ride it the first time without training wheels.  You'll either fall or find your way.  There are no lvls, no real restrictions on where you can in which ships, or anything like that.
#3 Impatient people.  You can't power lvl your way to the top in this game.  While skills won't make or break you they do accumulate over time(not based on your actions other than making sure you have some queued up).  So you won't be able to do everything perfectly anytime soon and it will take you awhile to do anything perfectly but that doesn't mean you're useless for month.  The oposite really.  You just may be stuck with a job you didn't imagine starting out in a PVP corp for example but your role will be vital trust me.  Sure you can buy characters(within the rules of the game) but well they aren't cheap and you'll probably fall on your face because you lack the knowledge to use them right.

No matter what though remember you can change waht you want to do at anytime(or create alts if you want to do more than one thing at a time starting out would be my recommendation).  So if you started out wanting to be miner but find it boring simply stop mining!  Sure some skill points will go to waste but don't get lost a goal that's not meant for you.

EVE is a fantastically complicated piece of brilliance. It can offer the most rewarding gaming experience for those who put the time and effort into learning the mechanics and nuances that reside within New Eden. If you want to build empires you can. If you want to get into the fight right away, there is a way. You can join a giant alliance or a small corporation, or you can go it alone. 

It is your sandbox and you may do with it what you will. The economy is deep and intricate with each station housing its own economy packed with items that are almost entirely produced by players. Markets react to player choice. The price of a module or a ship can vary wildly with supply and demand as powerful Null Sec Empires struggle for dominance and control. 

All those who play reside on a single server. It lives and breaths, ebbs and flows. The universe is beautiful as it is deadly. The world is full of gorgeous alien worlds, wormholes, space ships, stations, asteroids and epic battles that non players have seen on the news but can only wonder about.  

EVE is home to a wide variety of people who come together from all walks of life. I have met very interesting intelligent people from around the world. They come from all different backgrounds and come together to form a community like no other. 

The game itself has aged very well over its history. The developers are a dedicated team who cares about the players and more importantly, what EVE Online stands for, which is a universe that holds epic rewards and dishes out dire consequences. 

EVE is the best game I have ever and probably will ever play in my life. That being said this experience is not for everyone. I would venture to say that for every 10 people who try EVE 9 will quit within the first few days. 

The challenge will not be easy. The game mechanics are difficult to understand and can take years to master. I will admit, the UI isn't the best, although it has improved over the years. EVE doesn't just have game mechanics, they are layered on top of one another like a cake. While some shine, others are buried deep down becoming relics of times gone past. 

As a new player, you will struggle with basic functions. How do I undock? How do I equip a weapon to my ship? How do I move? How do I warp? Where is this mission objective? How do I accept a mission? Why did I just get blown up randomly, I was ‘mining’ my own business.... These are just a few of the questions that new players ask every day. 

Many will quit because they have too many questions, others will quit claiming they are bored running missions or mining, and yet others will quit because the game is just too damn brutal. These are all true statements. EVE is not WOW. Completing tasks will not be easy, but a job well done, a battle won, an enemy vanquished will feel 10X as rewarding because you risked it all to get there. You will rise to the top and fall straight off the ledge. 

 For the 1 out of 10 eve is like gravity, and the further you venture towards its center the tighter its grip will be upon you. Once you cross its event horizon EVE will have you forever and no other gaming experience will compare. ALL players take long absences but they always come back.

 In EVE if you lose your ship it is gone forever. The only thing is to learn from the mistake and grow as a player. Combat is short lived but very intense. Risk and reward is what EVE is about and those who embrace it will thrive while those who are afraid of it will wither. So if you are the type of player who enjoys a deep challenging and ultimately rewarding experience take a free trial. If you are the 1 out of 10 and New Eden is a place for you Im telling you from the bottom of my heart that It will be the most rewarding gaming experience of your life and well worth the money paid. And if you don't well...EVE is not for everyone.",1395028428,1395200884,True,26,0,0.687131166458129883,1,True,False,False

Especially new players; most will hate it while some will love it. While commonly described as an MMO and sandbox, a more accurate description of Eve Online may be that it is an economic simulator wrapped in a political simulator with “roguelite” elements. While initially intimidating to new players and overall unforgiving, especially endgame, Eve Online’s developer CCP has created a meritorious masterpiece that has received a bounty of awards since its inception.

The pace of the game will be off-putting to the majority of potential and new players. Unlike the majority of other MMO’s, acquiring new skills and abilities in Eve Online happens in real time; there is no experience to be gained by completing missions or killing rats (NPC’s). Training new skills will take a given amount of time in Eve online, but may be altered by changing a pilot’s attributes, by utilizing implants, which affect training time. Skills in Eve Online may take merely minutes to train or may take months. In ARPG’s, the point of the game is to acquire new, better, and rarer loot. During endgame, the new loot may augment the game in some facets, especially in the case of Path of Exile, but general gameplay elements (endlessly killing monsters) and those of the player’s chosen class largely remain the same creating stale, repetitive gameplay. The seemingly endless amount of skills to train in Eve Online means that there will almost always be something new to do in-game which functions similarly, yet superiorly, to loot in an ARPG.

Gameplay in Eve Online is unique and very much different from other MMO’s; a player cannot move his/her ship using WSAD. Instead, you give commands to your ship, such as “orbit at 30 km,” “approach,” “warp to,” etc. However, you can still double click anywhere in space and your ship will head in that direction. This lack of freedom of movement will also be unappealing to many, but it allows for more tactical gameplay especially in PvP.

PvP is heavily strategy based; an expensive ship can still lose to a relatively cheap one. PvP requires not only an in depth knowledge of what the function is of each ship, but the synergy amongst them. Also, it requires that a pilot know what modules to best fit his/her ship. However, a pilot’s individual mistakes and lack of understanding of the game may be made up for by other players, since PvP battle may consist of several thousand players.

Time Dilation (TiDi), is heralded by CCP as a triumph to reduce lag in epic, expansive battles involving thousands of players. TiDi supposedly reduces the passage of time in the system, where the battle is occurring by up to ten percent as to reduce the stress on the server’s hardware. CCP decided to introduce this so that things players did in the battle would not be processed out of order. However, players who have experienced TiDi will report that actions that would have taken no more than ten seconds instead take between several minutes and up to twenty minutes to complete.

Players are arranged into corporations, corporations may thus be arranged into alliances, alliances may thus be arranged into coalitions; all of which revolve around the economy. These arrangements allow for complex player run governments. These governments vie for control of various systems across the galaxy for the right to harvest various resources. Almost everything in-game can be made by players and then be sold on various markets. Unlike other MMO’s, such as World of Warcraft, the market in Eve Online utilizes a brokerage system akin to that of the stock market. 

CCP allows controversial actions such as extortion, thievery, espionage, and scamming in Eve Online. If a player were to do any of these in the majority of other MMO’s, he/she would be facing a permanent ban. These controversial actions fit well into the governmental arrangement of players as well into the occurrences of wars.

The effects of PvP are wide reaching; they can be felt across the game. Such was the case of the costliest battle in Eve Online history; B-R5RB. Prices in in-game markets, especially those in the main trade hub in Jita, fluctuated more than normal allowing traders to secure large profits.

PLEX (Pilot’s License Extension) in Eve Online is analogous to gold in the modern world; PLEX is what determines the worth of ISK. Also, much like gold, the value of PLEX fluctuates. PLEX is an in-game item equivalent to thirty days of game time. It can be bought in-game with ISK, hauled to various markets, and sold. It can also be purchased for twenty dollars. Comparatively, a one month subscription that is instantly activated on an account (not PLEX) costs fifteen dollars. While not free to play, it is more than possible to play Eve Online without having to open a wallet, although this will most likely be difficult in the first few months of a new player’s account.

While not often addressed, Eve Online utilizes many roguelike elements and thus, may be classified as a roguelite. Ships may cost tens of billions of ISK and when they are destroyed in battle, the pilot lose ISK which translates to a few thousand dollars (USD) lost. Those ships take real time to make; potentially thousands of man hours to make and months of waiting for it to roll off of a production line. When they are destroyed, they are gone. There is no respawn; they no longer exist. The most expensive ships are titans, the Death Stars of Eve Online, are worth approximately three thousand dollars. When a ship is destroyed in Eve Online, a pod is ejected containing the pilot. Should a pilot be unable to escape in his/her pod and be killed in battle, he/she loses a clone which may have billions of ISK in implants. The most harrowing of losses, due to mistakes, involve pilots not updating their medical clones to retain the skill points they’ve trained. Should a pilot fail have failed upgrade the clone and be killed, he/she stands to lose millions of skill points which may have taken months to train.

Anyone one can be ganked anywhere by other players. Whether a pilot actively engages in PvP or simply mines asteroids, he/she can be ganked. Systems in Eve Online are assigned a security status. Depending on the security status, the in-game NPC police force, known as CONCORD, may respond and aid the victim by attempting to destroy the aggressor.

Players are most often drawn into the game by the epic, lurid tales they hear of massive battles, espionage, or betrayal. Eve Online is a massive game. While events do occur like these on a daily basis, they are rather uncommon. As a result, many players do not make it past the trial version or tutorial because of this realization, whatever or whoever made them decide to try Eve Online made no mention of the incredibly slow pace, or the unusual and very different gameplay style.

Eve Online is not perfect; no game is. Developer CCP has claimed through its public relations that TiDi is indeed necessary and successful in its purpose. Despite these flaws CCP has done many things right. According to the Guinness World Records Gamer’s Edition 2014, the battle of 6VDT-H in Eve Online reached a total of 4,070 pilots fighting simultaneously, making it the largest PvP battle in history. CCP is one of the few MMO’s that welcomes immoral actions into its core gameplay. Eve Online is a game in which there is an incredible amount of depth as is evident by the way players produce goods, the manner that player governments who want to do so must hold their own territory in which the resources to do so reside, the in-game economy, and the strategies utilized by players in PvP. While the pace will be appalling to some, Eve Online warrants a try from all.",1394096426,1394364443,True,2,0,0.518005549907684326,0,True,False,False

1. Do you wish you could go into space?
2. Do you like shooting stuff?
3. Do you have time?

If you answered yes to those then EVE Online is quite possibly for you.
This game is probably about as fun as they get, Though for you to have fun you need to give a lot of time to this game but in exchange you will be rewarded with bigger and better ships, more currency, contacts and friends.
Being apart of a corporation in my opinion is crucial to the enjoyment of this game, you can go online just to talk to your friends if you don't particularly feel like flying around or blowing people up.

EVE is a game you really have to try to see if you like it or not, and the 14 day free trial in my opinion is just not long enough to really gain a clear understanding of it or to decide if you enjoy it.
What I can say though, is if you have friends playing EVE then you will probably enjoy it and they are bound to help you out

EVE Online isn't a game it's a lifestyle.  I've played since 2009 and I'm still learning with each ship lost.  Just recently there was a ship destroyed or should I say ships and the price on these im not ever sure what the real numbers are but thousands of USD for sure was lost in that fight.

They also have a Council of players elected by players to voice players concerns and it is called The Council of Stellar Management (CMS)

If you haven't tried it then you should really think about giving it a shot It's a great game once you figure it out, the learning curve is a cliff hanger but once you get your grip you should enjoy it and you'll be able to use in game currency to pay the monthly subscription with a little bit of effort.

I love space and Sci-fi themed games and the stunning visuals got my attention.
So I got myself an account and after a prolonged Character-creation I was finally ready to take on the vastness of space.

But then I realised I got myself a space-themed Excel program. Fighting doesn´t rely on personal skill or cool maneuvers.
It all boils down to the skills you selected for you avatar, your equipment and some point and klick...
Just like WOW.

And that killed it for me. I like to fly MYSELF. I want to learn stuff, test maneuvers, crank my Logitech 3D Joystick to the limit as a human being. If I want a character to level and to learn new skill at level up I play an RPG.

But the pretty much main thing besides money in this game is ships, some of the ships on this game are worth thousands of dollars in real money, I'm pretty sure you all heard about the giant battle of Titans those are the ships.

Another cool thing about this game is how it integrates with Dust 514, Dust is the console version of EVE an FPS MMO if you will if you have a PS3 you can play that but its all in the same universe, if you have friends on PS3 that play that (Not all of this may be spot on) you can go to the planet that the battle is on and provide cover fire. 

There is a monthly fee of about 15 dollars but if you make enough money in game or ISK you can buy PLEX, 1 PLEX will pay for your month of play time so if you aspire to be a rich business man then you dont even have to pay with real money WHICH I FREAKING LOVE by the way haha.

spoiled by a poor war declaration system 

basically anyone can declare war on you at little cost to them and no real loss of standings. so you can end up in constant war with players that are far superior to new players. Its basically a way for long terms players to legally attack other newer players with no interference by he athorities. 

i have literally spent weeks stuck in a station unable to leave cause i would just get instant killed and lose the ship that i can afford. There are players in my beginner corp on trial accounts who have player for six days and not been able to leave their space stations as they woudl get destroyed. 

i strongly suggest you use the trial to see it for yourself.. while its a stunning game and very rich ... it is weighted heavily to long term players with little mercy for new players which does not encourage you to keep going. Certainly don'y buy the year long subscription its not worth it given you could spend half your time stuck in a space station cause some long term players think it would be funny to attack you.",1392840212,1392840212,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The GMs are actually fair, explaining things to new players and, in my case, personally messaging them to see if they need help.

Grinding is virtually nonexistant. Newer players will need to focus instead on getting player contacts and choose their skills, which are trained in realtime even while not playing (up to a week of being offline).

Older players can and WILL be knocked back to newbie status if killed and they haven't cloned, so the game isn't always dominated by the same guys with big guns.

Today I was the Fleet Commander in a 12h Wormhole Daytrip (which is probably the most boring stuff i can do ingame atm, it was more of a social thing then about killing Sleepers, nvm the involuntary PVP we were engaged in). 
Some small tips if you want to check this game out:
- Get a Buddy Code for the trial, you get 1 Week more this way. Just contact anyone who owns the game for it, they will give it to you asap.
- After doing the tutorials, join a corporation. Brave Newbies Inc. or Eve University are standard Corps with lots of content.
- DON'T BECOME A MINER. It is not fun and you need at least 20 accounts mulitboxing to make good money from it
- Fly small ships and get blown up. Try to kill anything you find. Even your Fleetmates
- Don't buy it on steam, you will regret it in the long run

This game is awesome and if you follow those advices. It takes a couple of days to get into (or shorter if you make some good friends ingame), but it can be the 1 game for you.

I like everything that Eve promised. Space combat, exporation, trading... I can not say it delivered on any of that as I am unsure if I even finished the tutorial. Visually anything past the UI was nice, like real nice. Looking at titties on Brazzers nice. The UI though, ughh...was like watching two girls, one cup bad.

The tutorial was simply atrocious and taught me jack shit. I honestly couldn't tell if I ever finished the damn tutorial. I think its major failing was trying to rely on the interface. I was stuck on one part of the tutorial because I couldn't find a fucking button. A button, how a bout you highlight the damn thing. Maybe a little glowy circle around it after min or two. I dunno. Maybe explain how the inventory works like you are talking to someone that has not played the fucking game. Actually, the entire tutorial felt like it was written by someone that had obviously been playing for sometime and pulled the short straw at the dev meeting to kickoff who would make the tutorial. 

Eve has to have the dog ugliest interface known to man. Nothing seemed intuituve for a new player. That shit can be streamlined and improved. I tryed to see if I could atleast increase its size. Maybe if the little fucking buttons were a bit larger I thought. Fuck no though, no UI scaling. I thought maybe there is a mod to improve this shit bowl, nope again amigo. 

I felt like I was trying to force myself to play a game with a learning curve that didn't just go straight up but actually sloped back some over me. They make a tutorial that can actually get me up to speed with some basics and make an interface that was not designed by a damn mentally challenged person, I will reload the game.

    Let me start with why I have put hundreds of hours into EVE Online and why I would recommend it to a friend.

-Graphics and Music: The graphics and overall atmosphere in this game are amazing and will stay that way, CCP continues to update this game over the years visually so that every time you log in and undock into space you just stare with amazement at the beautiful wonder of space and on top of it all the musical score is wonderful and beautifully written.

-The Hud: This may seem like a weird thing to bring up but if you have played lots of MMOs you know how important a good Hud is, the interface and hud in this game is by far the best out of any MMO. Customizable in every way, no limit to how many windows you can have open, all the text is small and sleek, hotkeys for everything etc.... Just feels and looks great.

-Freedom: This game is a true Sandbox, you get thrown into space, there are no classes etc, you train in whatever you want so you become the kind of pilot you want. You can explore wormholes, scan down old space archaeological sites to get loot. You can be a pirate and gank people just for the hell of it and take their stuff. You can be a bounty hunger or a miner or be part of a huge corporation playing the politics and trading goods on the market and much much more.

Now for why I do not play the game haha.
          I have plaid this game off and on for years now and the reasons I stop playing are always the same.

1. This game requires a large time investment to really have fun, you can get in and run a quick mission in half an hour. However to really do anything worth doing you are talking 6-9 hours.

2. The skill system is setup so that you have your character studying a skill book and they study that in real time. This is great because they keep on studying when you are at work etc... However because of this you do not feel any real drive or reason to play the game. Other then making ISK (which is the in game currency) and once you have enough isk you really run out of reasons to play. This could be easily solved by making it so that as you reach certain goals in the game or accomplish certain missions etc... to speeds up your study time but there is no feature like this so you eventually just get bored and lose any drive to play when you realize you need to wait 2 weeks before you can get your new gun or ship no matter how much you play.

So do I recommend this game? yes, great game. Do I think you are going to keep on playing it? no, you will most likely have a love/hate relationship like myself and every other person I know.",1390449815,1390450231,True,1,0,0.509803950786590576,0,True,False,False

EVE online sucks for new players who have no idea what they are getting into. If you hope to pick this game up and dive right in and be blasting fools with lasers in a dog fight in space you are sorely mistaken as to what EVE online really is.
 
EVE online falls into that love hate relationship that I have with many games, I love it for how beautiful it is, how complex it is, the depth of the game, and how it is by far the truest MMORPG game out there to that extent. The game is daunting to get into once you first try it out, and it does take dedication that I think a lot of MMOs these days have steered away from for all the wrong reasons. Yes EVE could be played casually but it will still require some dedication to the player to first understand what EVE is, it does not reward you for simple tasks, or patronize you to keep playing or completing arbitrary missions. 

EVE expects you to learn about the game, how to make money, where to go and where not to go, and how you should conduct yourself. If you fail to do any of these things you will be punished and I think it is that establish punishment that is lost on most games now a days. Unlike MMOs like World of Warcraft for example, if you are shot down your ship is destroyed well you not only lost your ship but the cargo the ship was carrying as well. So not only can other players destroy something you invested heavily into but they can also salvage your cargo and take whatever it was you were hauling if you were hauling anything at that time. Not only can you lose your ship, and your cargo but if you are killed or ""podded"" as the community has coined it, you lose all player advancement between the time your shot down to whatever your last clone is updated to. 

Now this may sound confusing but EVE does not have a leveling system, you do not gain levels you simply gain skills. Skills take real time to develop (thankfully you are not required to be logged into the game to still develop these skills), and as in the games intro you are one of many clones. So resurrection is covered lore wise, and it provides a unique system in which players have to ensure their clones are up to snuff before setting out into hostile territory. Certain clones can only contain so many skills before they are obsolete and you are required to purchase better clones to replace you if you are killed.

 So for example you leaned a fancy new skill that cannot be learned to your old clones in storage, and you forgot to update them. Well if you get killed you lost that skill, so all the time you spent learning it (and yes some skills take weeks to learn) is lost. Not only do you lose skills, ISK (currency) from your ships being destroyed and cargo stolen, but any modifications you performed are also lost when that body is destroyed.

 PVP is a big thing for EVE, there are PVE elements in the game but ultimately it is the players that shape the game more than the developers. Now there are no safe zones every zone is contested and players can engage in combat at will wherever they choose, and it is with this notion that PVP can occur everywhere that makes this game exciting, interesting and fun to play.

As for the things I hate about this game, well.. Let me just say that the learning curve is really high for new players. and experienced players can and will take advantage of that. But even outside of that the level of complexity the game has within the UI is a bit daunting and until you have gained enough feel for how to perform certain actions remembering where things are can be troublesome. To be fair though I cannot simply fault this game solely on these things alone there are a lot of positive things that make me want to play this game, and if you enjoy ganking people and having actual impacts upon them then this game is perfect for you to terrorize other players in. It is just that the time it takes to do much within any MMO is great, and EVE is no exception to speed and efficiency when it comes to getting yourself into a position in which you can roll out and kill people at will.

If I had nothing better to do with my time I could see myself playing this game for hours and hours, especially since I can cause mayhem as a space pirate in a world that allows for such activity to exist.

It is definitely a time sinker and can be quite slow paced if you're not with a good group or don't know what you're doing. There is a little to offer everyone and with the promise of more content and optimizations for the game franchise, it will continue to grow over time. 

The greatest time sink in this game would have to be growing your skills. This can take quite a while but, for those who are willing to play through a slow period of a week or two to access greater opportunities, it is worth it. Combat is intuitive, although targeting micromanagement may be the greatest issue there. The community is friendly enough if you approach them in proper ways. Attempting to vulture loot from a recent skirmish however, is likely not the best way to make friends. 

The shear depth of this game is mind-boggling and can easily be overwhelming. Fortunately, portions of the community are more than happy to help new players get their footing in what I feel to be a wonderful game. Joining a Corporation(Clan/Guild/Outfit etc.) is likely the best move for a novice player to start with, as you will quickly gain access to resources you otherwise would not have.

In short, I would highly recommend this game to MMO players and to others looking for a great space simulator. Be warned however, that this game is a massive time consumer and can possibly even burn a hole in your wallet if you choose.

TL;DR 

Gorgeous space based MMO with good community and great mechanics for an MMO. It can be a time sink and be rather tedious at times, but worth it if you take time to learn and appreciate the game for what it's trying to do: Be a damn good MMO.",1389584999,1389584999,True,1,0,0.519895434379577637,0,True,False,False

But the rewards are equally severe. To some it's a nightmare, to others it's a second life. Amidst the miners, traders, pirates, captains of industry, loyal servants of the state, pioneers and explorers, you'll find your place.

EVE is an investment, and for a long time it can seem like that it won't pay off, it's not a simple, instant-gratification game. Although the old tired line of ""being whoever you want"" and ""do whatever you want"" gets tossed around a lot with MMOs, open-world games and other similar genres, it does ring true to an extent. You can do what you want within the boundary of the game, but guaranteed you will rub up against people who are doing what they want. As I mentioned previously, EVE is a harsh mistress. You may think your simple mining vessel isn't a threat to anyone, and maybe it isn't. But there will be somebody out there who will see you as a target, encroaching on their territory, or their resources, or just see you as a fat juicy killmail.

It requires a lot of work, but the rewards in the long-run are fulfilling. When you spend those weeks, training skills, piloting small ships, mining and making scraps, only to finally step into your new battleship, or mining vessel - there's no feeling quite like it.

And it's not easy to let go of, either. I've played seperately over 5 different periods since I first entered the world of EVE 7 years ago, and while to some I am nothing but a whelp in terms of power, skills, finances, or reach, I feel I have come a long way. I have my place in the EVE Universe, and it is forever changing.

I have now played almost for a year straight and a couple of months started a second account through Steam and have not regretted it since.
I've tried WoW, I've played a bit of this and that. MMOs are boring grind fests, all the same.
But EVE is different, it actually requires you to use your brains. The world is dangerous, maybe a bit too dangerous times to times but it is also rewarding. There's everything for everyone, you can mine, trade, build, invent, explore, kill NPCs, kill players, lead small and big fleet, build a functioning corporation that makes profit, you can stay in ""safe"" space or wander somewhere with more risks, you can even do politics, whatever you want.

Skill progression is very different from any usual MMO, your skills advance in real time, it takes so many minutes and so many days or months to master skills, training all skills in the game probably takes 10 years, but thankfully you won't need 10 years to be good at something. Because of this system your skills progress even though you're having a holiday somewhere warm so that easens a bit of burden of advancement. Altought it also can be frustrating as some skills take days, weeks, months to master.

What is also positive is that EVE is not free to play, you don't have to pay micro transactions to be able to play properly, CCP has not taken that trend and lets hope it won't turn to that anytime soon.

""I'm a sucker for drama and epic scale, and an eight-hour running battle between two fleets of 100-200 each jousting for position across an entire star system, warping in and out from staging points to attack vital starbases, complete with line ships and capital ships exchanging fire at 150km, interceptors and interdictors zooming across the void trying to pin them down, point defense ships trying to target and shred the fragile interdictors before they can slow the fleet down, repair ships sitting in hopefully safe parts of the system and patching wounds, cloaking scouts keeping an eye on movements and reinforcements and trying to scan out locations that various people mistakenly think are safe, electronic warfare ships trying to blind people from the previous categories, and each and every one of these controlled by players...

...and this is even before you zoom out and consider the wider ramifications. What'll happen to Alliance X's income if they lose this system and logistics routes to a quarter of their territory are cut or at least made vastly more difficult?  What about the consequences to their political reputation? Internal morale? What about the commeasurate gains for Alliance Y? How will all this affect the potential choices of Alliances A-X, Massive Powerblock Z, and the price of veldspar in Jita?...

...well, the first thing you'd think of is ""lag"", to be fair, and that certainly happens - especially in the combat environments I prefer.

I have seen and experienced things that I have never in any other massive multiplayer game. I tip my hat to CCP in their ongoing development of this title. A decade strong, and they are still pumping out one or two expansions per year.

Now, what to actually say about this game. You spend your first week playing the game learning the basics of how to navigate through New Eden, but the learning doesn't stop there. When I say basics, I really mean the basics. Once, you're released into to universe you come out with a puffed chest and you feel like the world is your oyster (and it really can be!). You jump into a corporation or you start one, and you begin your journey. You, the player, are in control of everything that you decide to do. You can train up your security-based skills and head out on missions to burn pirates & and make some ISK. OR you can head off into the pvp realm of the game and bring chaos and disorder amongst your fellow capsuleers. Maybe you have a mind for business so you set up contracts and buy/sell orders on the market, and rake in the ISK. Maybe you like to work and explore, so you load up your mining/salvage vessel and you head out into the far reaches of space and look for the ""mother-load"". It's really all up to you, and that is just part of what makes EVE such a fantastic game.

Then there's the under side of the coin. Flip that over and you find that you have not only opened Pandora's box, but you are neck deep in the worst way. Remember that oyster that you thought was yours at the end of your training days? Yeah, you find that you don't want it anymore. You hate it. You despise it. EVE Online is a great game to play, and the things I listed out earlier really are fun and prosperous, but those same exact things are what can get you into trouble. That's right, this game is so community driven, and cut-throat that you never know who to trust out in the stars. You could have a really great operation going, but if you irk the wrong person or even maybe just pass by the wrong person at the wrong time, then you could potentially watch everything that you've done crumble before your very eyes. Now, this may really make you think, ""Yeah, I don't want that to happen. So what's the point if you are just going to lose it all?"" I agree, it sounds so wrong, and unappealling, but you have to accept that eventually your empire will crumble into ash. The beauty of it though is that this happens to everyone. No one in EVE Online is a god amongst ants. Sometimes, you'll see a situation that feels that way, but there will always be someone else who will topple everything over. It's all a matter of how you take your steps, and how you act accordingly.

All in all, I know that this game isn't for everyone, but I at least encourage everyone to give it a shot for a couple months. If you don't like it and you can't handle the cut-throat aspects of the game, then that's fine. We understand, and it's probably best that you aren't among us. Otherwise, if you find that you really like the game and want to amass your fleets to take on all of New Eden, then well, all I have to say is

Welcome to the stars.

The Good
The player base is really helpful most the time.
It's visually stunning

The Bad
The missions are as dull as watching paint dry
You are always at risk of being ganked generally for no other reason other than they can.
Designed to be addictive and to make money, not to entertain gamers
The learning curve is huge
You must pay for at least 3 months gametime and train skills constantly to have any sort of chance in PVP

Everything in EVE is relative, especially movement. Being able to see your ship in 3D space is irrelevent when you can do it entirely with the text data provided for you. 

This game is almost entirely Player driven. There are some NPC's but the market, logistics, security, and pretty much every other aspect of the game experience is controlled by players.

It is an near perfect libertarian-capitalist environment. Hard work, dedication, and cooperation are greatly rewarded, but sloth and foolishness are severely punished.

Because of this, you get a SEVERE amount of freedom. Diplomatic players can actually reap the benefits and travel freely between factions. You're not locked in by choices you've made from the second you've started playing your character, just the ones you've made well into your game.

Another side effect of this freedom/cooperation style of gameplay is that you may very well NEVER pilot an awesome fighter frigate/crusier/destroyer in your life, and you'll be totally ok with that. It is very likely that you'll have gotten a mining barge so huge, that you can afford to pay people to pilot fighting ships for you to keep away those pesky player-pirates. Or you could BE a player pirate, blowing up secuirty teams and expensive mining barges and taking their cargo. For that matter, you might even decide you want to build an awesome stealth-salvager to run away with the ship wreckage after those pirates and security players blow eachother up.

It is not for the faint of heart or even those kinda interested in what its about. It's learning curve can be death defying.

Known as Spreadsheets in Space, this game has everything you would ever need and also nothing all at once.

If you like space ships, big explosions, espianoge, beefy weapons, intergalactic trading, rep grinding, a highly social interaction mechinism, exploring, fighting, planning, mining, story, group events and many MANY other things... this is the game for you. HOWEVER you MUST at least have some aspect of patience. This game isn't one where you take a week and a half of solid gameplay and BAM your highest tier. Your learn through TIME, not action. Your skills automatically learn while your offline AND online. So go ahead, leave the game for a bit and a subscription intact, when you come back it'll be ready for you to set the next one.

This is one hell of a fun game if you want it to be. From the newer mechanics that they are constantly popping into existence, to older ones that still have relevance, it can take HOURS away from you in only a matter of clicks.

Some things to acknowledge: PLEX is different than a Time Code. PLEX you CAN trade for in game time, or you can buy it with in game currency (which if you make enough ISK, which is in game currency, you can basically play for free). However you cannot trade Time Codes. SO remember what your buying before you click OK.

Null Sec and High Sec are now active parts of the game, so just because your friends play in Null and your scared, doesn't mean your missing out on half the game anymore.

You need a computer to handle it, they've upgraded a LOT of graphics and removed some of the older problems. This being said if your computer could barely run EVE a year or so ago (this is 2013 at time of writing) then it can't run it now.

It is one hell of a game, one awesome world to live in, and can be addicting. SO if you cannot handle something like this on your own, DO NOT PLAY.

If you like trading, the game has it. A whole skill tree focused on allowing you to set tons of buy/sell orders and player contracts around the universe. And pirates to try to rob you as you carry your valuables through low security sectors.
If you like scamming, the game has it. And it's not against the rules. o.O 
There's a contract system for most of the interactions you might want with an untrusted player, but there's also a guide on how to use the contract system to scam people (like offering a contract where they'll pay and give you some items instead of receiving).

If you're into adventure, the game has it. If you google ""eve online star map"", you'll find a map of the KNOWN universe. Each dot there is a solar system you can explore. There are parts of the universe that won't show on map and can only be reached through wormholes. So... you might die irl before exploring everything.

If you're into combat, the game has it. From pve or suicidal attacks to mess up with afk miners in high security sectors up to full scale hundreds vs hundreds wars in player-owned null security sectors. You can expect some lagging on massive wars, but rest assured that it's balanced among all players to make the combat fair.

Expensive. Too expensive for an mmo. The starter pack with steam discount is worth it, and if you focus on gathering money, you might be able to buy the PLEX in game to get another 30 days. But probably won't have much ingame progress. Otherwise it may take a few months until you're able to get PLEX and play. Once you start playing, the game doesn't feel that expensive anymore, but it's kinda hard to get your friends to try the game. 

The steam starter pack has two problems. First, one of the items will give +9 of each attribute for a player up to 14 days after creation. The boost is awesome, and speeds up skill training a lot. The problem is that you'll get no warning when you create your character that you have an item that will only work until 14 days after creation. Most people end up losing a few days because they didn't know they had the item or thought it would be better to save until they're training higher level skills. 

The second problem is that the items on the starter pack have a value too high for new players. It wouldn't really be a problem if it wasn't for a single detail: you may lose most of them if you get killed. Some may be stored in a station until you're able to use them, but some only have value if you have them active or on you. The ship may be lost if you engage pve combat and don't know how to escape if things get bad. The +9 booster MAY be lost if a player destroys your escape pod after destroying your ship. Some reported that they lost, some that they didn't lose. I wouldn't want to risk. That's almost a 50% booster for noobs who don't have access to implants.

Anyways, the golden rule of this game is ""don't buy what you can't afford to lose"". As a noob you can't recover anything you get from the starter pack. It's not like you can't survive without them, but it's pretty annoying to lose all that stuff if you get suicide ganked by someone the second you step out of a station in a high security sector. Even though it's not something that happens often, it is possible.

Other than that, this is not a game for 12yo kids that used to play alliance hunter on WoW. If you want to see their impressions of the game just check the negative reviews on metacritic: ""QQ this is too hard. Where's my IWIN button???"", ""QQ me no understands this."",  ""QQ me wants iwin button plis"".",1388258245,1388259274,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,1,True,False,False

But the problem with Eve itself is, that it may offer a ton of things you can do but the main problem is that it will take you a long time to really get started into something. The things you can do or make are massive, but considering the fact that the skill system is time based, you may only concentrate on one thing(for example: mining) and have to stay with it as something different will take a long time to be efficient or even -fun-.

And speaking of fun, this game is only something for work-a-holics. Things to do take a long time, even plain traveling and there is not a lot you can do while it. If you want to have fun by blowing up other people or make money you will have to literally work for it and I mean this in terms of waiting, waiting and calculating.

To skip those waiting processes or do tasks that are meant for multiple persons, people tend to buy multiple accounts and to keep them alive, you either need to A) purchase gametime or B) farm several hours (maybe 10-20 with GOOD skills) to get a plex. 

The combat system is slow and this is intended as this game will set you up with people around the globe. But to be honest, there is not a lot of how you can influence the combat with your own skill. What counts are simple decisions and Skills in term of In-game idled skills.

So if you really want to play Eve consider taking a lot of time or money to be efficient. And if you want to get out in 0.0, keep in mind that you probably will just end as a 'fighting drone' for some Alliance.

Yes, you did read that correctly there is no grinding. The level system works based on time in or out of the game. Say you choose the skill to be able to captain the next size ship. Leveling can take anywhere from minutes to days based on the skill, but you do not need to be logged in to have the timer active.

Frequent updates

Cons
Combat is boring
Mining is boring

The game and developers encourage misconduct which is wrong

I do like EVE and the whole aspect it brings with it but a problem I found with it was I spend a lot of the time playing EVE doing nothing.  It sounds weird but it feels like sometimes your wasting time when you could do something else.  To get a good headstart into the game, it's recommended to get a read up a lot of the content that EVE throws at you because the learning curve of EVE ramps up very fast.  When you have done that, chances are it will seems pretty empty and joining a corp will be your best bet to staying in the game.

Joining corps also brings in new problems. Chances are if you are new, you might have no idea of what the corp does or what wars are going on and you find yourself floating as a dead corpse in cold and unforgiving space.

But if you're looking for a one-word description of this fantastic game, that word is going to be ""Emergent"".

What makes EVE Online so unique is the player-driven aspect to everything in this game.  EVE players create the economy (it is 99% driven by players); players create the wars and news stories you hear about; players create content through alliances, piracy, industry, and exploration; and most importantly for me, players create STORY through their interactions not only with each other, but with the developers as well, ensuring that New Eden is a living, thriving place that Capsuleers feel a part of.

To say that EVE has a steep learning curve is a bit of an understatement, but the devs have spent the last year or more working on the new player experience, making EVE a vastly more inviting game.  No longer will you be dumped straight into the action with no idea what's going on.  Instead, tutorials and starting missions give you experience and understanding into the core mechanics; new interfaces make ships and progression easier to understand; and active player corporations dedicated entirely to educating the masses are available and easy to get into.  And with dedicated roles that players can start to focus on at any time, even the newest player can give a veteran a run for their money.

Offline progression and the PLEX system ensure that no matter how much time you have available, you'll always be able to fit into New Eden.  Have too much time on your hands?  Then buy PLEX directly with in-game currency to essentially play for free!  Don't have nearly as much time to play because you're constantly working?  Then buy a PLEX from the EVE Store and sell it on the in-game market for a quick and legal way to buy in-game currency!

EVE Online is fantastic for any player looking for a real sandbox-style game with consequences, sci-fi and space sim fans alike, and those seeking gameplay that you simply can't find anywhere else.  Comes highly recommended.",1385825318,1385825318,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Eve online is a game based entirely in space where you can create your own persona in an online universe, piloting different space ships and making allies.
 

Gameplay: The only thing you need to play this game is the mouse. Everything in the game including combat, mining, traveling, making trades, and constructing objects requires you to either point and click or right click and select the appropriate option. Now this sounds boring and impractical but the first time you fight multiple enemies at once, you'll find that not only is it intense, but it works well. The majority of the game will be spent either doing missions, mining materials, or managing resources (building stuff, and buying/selling objects). You get quests/missions while docked at space stations and can buy and sell stuff there as well in an auction house like style. The missions are fun and get harder as you train your skills up to use bigger and better ships. 

The skill system is also unique to EVE online because you don't actually have to play the game to become the strongest character you can be. The way you train your skills in this game is by selecting it, and waiting for it to level up, there are 5 levels per skill and it takes longer for the skill to level up (training a skill from 4 - 5 can sometimes take more than a week). This is both a great and bad thing about the game.  The reason that this can be both is because if your a 12 year old or someone who has tons of time on their hands you'll feel like the developer is controlling how fast your character can level because there's nothing you can do to make your character level up faster. But if you're like me (a university stundent) or someone who has very little time to grind and do raids on a weekly basis, then having the ability to level up with minimal play time is good. You will need in game money to buy more advanced skills however, so this does force players to devote some time to playing the game. 

There's a lot of customization with the ships, weapons, and various mods you can equip to your ship such as boosters (which allow the ship to go faster) and stasis fields, which can slow an enemy ship down. I should also mention that the game is PVP, meaning that any player at any time can kill you, and you can do the same. I found it to be an exciting part of the game but I can see how others would hate the idea. I should say that each system in the game (you travel from system to system to do quests and stuff) has different security ratings with 1.0 being the highest, were no-one can kill another player without getting the cops on their asses (and the NPC cops are tough) and 0.0 being the lowest were everything goes... this means even if you hate the idea of PvP, you can hang out in 1.0 space without too much to worry about. 

Graphics: The graphics are great, they have been great for the past several years, and continue to improve as the developers upgrade them from DX9 to DX10 through patches. The vast space landscapes are beautiful and make the look and feeling of being in space believable. The graphics are great, but it does suffer from the same things as MMOs like the Matrix Online; Which is copied models being used over and over. Its not a big deal, but yes, every 10 or so missions you will see the same space station and randomized asteroid fields. There are 4 different factions in the game, so when you visit their systems and their stations you do get a sense of the environment being different. 


Story: Unlike MMO's such as World of Warcraft, EVE online doesn't really have a story to speak of. All of the quests in Eve are given through text, and most quest line only last between 6 to 12 missions before shifting to a new quest line. During these however a minor story usually exists, and example of this would be the first few fighting quests you can get; they have you investigating and taking out pirates and at the end of this quest line you can either join the tyrant you have been fighting against (aka do pirate missions) or kill him (continue to do pro-civilized missions). Even without too much of a story, you'll be enthralled with the game play, and satisfied at least, with the mini stories you do get. 


Sound: The sounds are great and work to make the space universe seem real. The thrusters on your ship sound real, the guns rail off shots and snap well, and when enemy ships blow up, the explosions sound good. There is music as well which fits the mood well, none of it licensed but it does sound like 80 SiFi films, much like John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" or music heard during the quiet moments of games like Mass Effect, which is good. There's also miscellaneous sounds when you're docked at stations sounds of stuff being moved and little touches like that, so it sounds good. 


Overall: This is a good game, but its not for people who like grinding and questing for XP in games like WoW. You have to wait for your skills to level, and some people are not going like that aspect of the game. Some people will enjoy not having to devote hours a day to gain level however, which is good. The game looks great, plays great, and has a large following who don't want to go play WoW or any other MMO anytime soon. The game is updated on a regular basis with free expansions that come out around every 6 months. So with a good online community, lasting appeal, great game play, graphics and sound, this game is something that if you're at all interested in, should give a try.  
 
 

Update November 2009 -
I read my review over again after I heard of the lastest expansion coming out, and I would like to clarify. Eve Online is not really a game for people looking for out-of-the-box fun. Eve Online really is better described as a space life simulator, in the sense that if you want to create an alter ego and create a well known company or become a feared pirate (not to NPCs but actual people) then you can in Eve, but it will require months of your life to do so. Alot of people play this game for one month and complain about the lack of fun they have, and fail to see that this is a game that requires a significant investment of time to really affect yourself or the game world. I also forgot to mention in my orginal review that (most definitly) 90% of the people who try this will be turned off by the game; I'm an interesting case because this was my first MMO that I tried at age 12... to give you an idea of how this MMOs difficulty is; I didn't even know how to move my ship the first day I played the game. 
 
But after I got over that ""minor"" problem I realized the potential of the world in this game, its like the real world. You can fly up behind someone and blow their brians out or make contacts and trade routes to make money and become a powerhouse in the entire game world. I can say this without any question or doubt in my mind, this is the most advanced MMO out there, you can change the world, and I don't mean change the world WoW style by getting a purple sword or  killing a character, or some bullshit like that, at the end of the day someone else has that sword too and the person (NPC or real) will respawn for someone else to kill. When you and a corp take on another corp and win a battle or when you get enough cash to control a trade route or material in the world you change how others must play (in either good or bad ways). If your in it for some quick fun, realistically, I should tell you to go play WoW, but if you want to build up yourself and make a difference in another world (it will take several months of devotion, no doubt) then give this game a shot; don't be afraid of this game, its like real life in that it has amazing opportunities...  but with lasers.

Eve Online is essentially an economy simulator in space. You get a ship and you can fight things, but the crux of the game is money: how do you get it? What do you do with it once you have it?

You might be a miner, a freighter pilot, a smuggler, a bounty hunter, a mercenary, a security specialist or a CEO. One way or another, you make money in space.

And they add new stuff to the game all the time. And by that I don't mean content. There's not much ""content"" in the game in the form of ""stuff to do."" It's VERY sandboxy. The attitude of the dev team is ""here's our game. Play it or gtfo."" That's not to say that they don't listen to the playerbase, but they don't compromise their vision to the extent that Blizzard will with WoW.

I give Eve Online an A+. Seriously. This is one of my favorite games ever. I don't play it now because I have more important ways to spend 15 bucks a month.

And don't forget the first rule of Eve: if you can't afford to lose it, don't take it off the station. There is no such thing as ""unfair"" in Eve. Devs don't listen to complaints of ""this dude stole my stuff."" Well yeah. He's a pirate. Stealing is what he does. Shut up.

A game where, given the time and energy, can not only be played for free, but can allow you pilot machines that are larger than imagination. You can be a part of something much greater than yourself. You can take on the entire galaxy if you should so desire. Just be aware that there are consequences to your actions and that an ounce of caution is sometimes worth more than a ton of skill. 
A massive time sink and potential money sink but once you get going, it's hard to stop. Skills train in real time so you may not reach your goal as quickly as you would like but as long as you keep going, you will reach it. Just remember before starting, it's a ruthless universe out there and you basically just have to deal with it. 8/10",1385508264,1385508897,True,1,0,0.500567495822906494,0,True,False,False

As many of its detractors point out it can sometimes be considered a second job to many of its players and in some cases this moniker is justified. For others this can be a reaction to the steep learning curve presented by some of the main mechanics and also the sheer depth of the world.

Unlike other MMO's EVE relies almost entirely on its player to player interactions to drive the world. From war to mining everything is done to, for or with other players and it is to the games credit that so many options are presented at each level of play.

The game has a very steep learning curve and a very unforgiving community, but where there is challenge comes great reward if you stick around long enough to learn how to play properly and turn a profit.

Essential Info about the game:
   * EVE has no levels or classes. All skills are trained in real time even when you are offline.
   * Two free expansions a year
   * Once you start earning enough in game cash you wont ever have to pay a subscription fee again.

Gameplay wise the game plays more like Knights of the Old Republic in terms of combat to compare it to anything else. The ship movement is not like Freelancer or Elite, and combat can sometimes be slow paced. Community wise it has both it's ups and downs, there are always organisations and groups to help you out and get you started on the right path. The game features an extensive API that is integrated with dozens of addons and tools accross the web from tracking your in game mail and skills offline, to monitoring star system activity.

The downsides to EVE against over MMOs is that it can be overwhelming. Corporations (clans) have many confusing aspects to them from tax rates to seperate divisions along with titles and roles. The UI is hardly friendly to begin with and requires players to set it up to be their own and how they can use it best. Unlike other MMOs death is a setback and punishment, if your ship gets totaled then you lose all of your equipment and modules on it, if you die then you lose implants and need to buy them again.

The community can sometimes be visceral and real, many players take the game very seriously and do not mess around, but the more casual gamers can be found at it's core. EVE allows for nearly any type of gameplay, from being a lawless outlaw and killing anyone you see, to running a massive corporate alliance manufacturing weapons and starting wars between players.

EVE Online is tied into two other games, those are Dust 514 and EVE Valkyrie (Valkyrie still in development). Actions taken in Dust effect EVE, they share a market and a currency, and battles on planets in Dust are happening real time in EVE. If a player in dust calls in an orbital bombardment then there is a player in EVE online piloting the battleship that carries out that bombardment.

It is a game people should always try once and give it a go, many people who dislike it do not give it enough time and over my years of playing it the game has improved considerably and with the Rubicon expansion, is beginning to change forever.",1385464002,1385464487,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You will think that all menu and window confusing at first but once you set a path for yourself you'll find that menu and option windows be less scary. Once get a grip to how all menu work you'll find that game itself is GREAT FUN!. They say that get into larger ship take very long time, ""THIS IS NOT TRUE"". If you know what ship want to fly you can spent the skill points aiming toward that ship and not mind taking points in any other skill. As you start out you will get skill points given to you AND get 14 day booster that help with skill training. A good pilot will be able go from day 1 in friget to day 30 into battle crusier AND by 1 year you'll able to fly a full spec out battle ship with all trimming, ""even fuzzy dice hang from window of cocpit"".

Music&Sound Effects: 71%, audio on Eve online is well thought out and rare thing, full 3d sound and can even hear your engie on ship running and rawr of rocket heading toward you.

Controls: 90%, Eve online is point and click game for most part BUT can custom build key bind to whatever feel you need it to be, want buttion that fire all weapon? you can, want buttion that lock all enemrys? you can.

OVERALL: 98%, Eve online wonderful game that can be pick up very quick AND even after logged off from game, your char still continue on with buiness getting skill, making money off market, building BIGGER BETTER MORE POWERFUL SHIPS!

BAD POINTS. I could suger coat this and say Eve has no down side but it wouldn't be real review so. EVE Online has many down sides, specialy on Steam. I found that could buy 1 plex off steam store, am sure will be fixed at somepoint.

EVE is not a grind, you do not have to grind for experiance, it accumulates over time.  The only possible way to grind is to grind shooting NPC pirates or mining, but that is by no means mandatory.  There are creative ways to make money, or in some cases, relieveing other people of their money.  Almost everything is legal, scamming is encouraged.

The real meat of the game is in its player driven content.  The world is shaped by the players, both the economic, and political world, in a way that other static content games can't even begin to approach.

With it's passive skill system, the game moves away from the need to always be online and always be working towards a goal. Anything on a schedule beyond simply updating your skill queue is something you decide on investing in or not.

Since it's originaly incarnation in 2004, the game has improved steadily. From moving to DirectX9 and retiring it's old DirectX8 engine (with rumors of DX11 and tesselation coming in the future), to improvements in tutorials and reacting to player feedback, CCP proves they are willing to work with the game on the notion that it's shared by the playerbase.

All ships in EvE Online tend to have a role that the ship excels at. In one case you may have a frigate that you'd assume to be not worth your time, but they serve a vital role in fleet fights and have numerous advantages over bigger, heavier ships.

EvE Online does require a monthly fee, but it is possible, if you get yourself established well enough, to pay for your subscription by buying in-game representations of 30-days for your account. However, like all items in EvE, they are subject to scams, thefts, destruction and so on which means that you'll have to be on your toes when dealing with trades and transport.

EvE Online is hands-down my favorite MMO. Others have tried, but none have come close to the sense that you, as the player, get to carve out not only what's going on in the universe, but what your place is in it.",1362472729,1385409990,True,4,0,0.557762503623962402,0,True,False,False

After playing 648.8 hours and wasting more than enough money on this game I can assure you, It is a complete waste of time.

Eve Online allows you to:

- Train skills for months on end! (In real time) for little to no reward!
- Grind missions for measly amounts of in game currency, which amount to nothing next time some 'veteran' pirate ganker asshole swings your way
- Head into area's of space known as nullsec and lowsec with the promise of attaining great wealth only to be met with gate camp after gatecamp after gate camp, and lets assume you avoid these gate camps, there's no guarantee you wont find yourself at the receiving end of a covert ops bomb launcher.
- Engage in cross platform combat with the players of the most generic space fps to release since the dawn of time
- Buy a PLEX (Which can be essentially used as a pay to win feature) that gives a considerable amount of in-game currency to piss away on the next encounter with your friendly neighborhood ganker.
- Shoot a laser at a rock for hours on end to ""mine"" minerals from asteroids which you can use to make items or piss away on the marketplace.
- Be a semi-anonymous sociopath with delusions of grandeur.

Its not so much 'dumbed down' as streamlined. Graphically it STILL looks stunning, now making full use of modern GFX cards. But the core dynamic is the same.. its a huge and beautiful sandbox.

Whilst my old account has a few years worth of training, I've decided to start completley afresh.. no baggage and no billion ISK to help.. and I'm so pleased I did. I have forgotten more about how to play this game than any other.. the systems are complex but rewarding because they are complex.

I went the whole hog and grabbed a discounted yearly subscription, and I'm really looking forward to spending as much time playing as I can.

If you remember “Home World” and you liked it then this is a Space Game you might find interesting, the game provides a huge Universe, and we I say huge I really do mean HUGE. The game is full of tiny details about space ships, military ships, mining ships, insurance, Market… etc. The game provides a unique type of playing experience, as you can chose to live the PVE* or the PVP** life, which gives the player the choice based on his style of gaming. 
*PVE = Player Vs Environment
** PVP = Player Vs Player


(The Bad)
The game is Complicated, and when I say complicated I mean it is even hard to complete the “Tutorial”. The Game has so many options that you are immediately forced to interact with while you do not understand the basics of the game. This forces a very steep learning curve. While other games such as WoW let you focus on playing and then giving you options while you level to gradually learn the game and master it. the map is as useless as it could be to a blind man, as it does not show you when you are going or even where are you in the first place.

(The Rating)
Good game with huge potential, but very hard to play simply because of the complicated tools and tutorial. ( RATING 6 / 10 )",1375635783,1375635783,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EVE just had it's 10-year birthday and it's looking better than ever. CCP Games has updated the game constantly with FREE expansions, adding more and more content every time.

7,500 star systems, each with their own planets, asteroid belts, stations, wormholes etc. Economy that is fully player driven. Huge corporations ran by players, some part of larger alliances, some trying to make it on their own. 

Many different professions ranging from military to industry, business and exploration.

Quite high learning curve, requires a lot of micro managing when setting up ship builds, choosing which skills to train, scanning treasures with probes, mining asteroids, calculating safe flight paths.

In EVE, your character keeps training new skills even if you're offline and it's almost (I think) impossible to ""reach the max level"" - or learn all skills. That would take years.

After a trial period you can pay your gametime with money or with in-game currency ISK.

Be a Trader, Manufacturer, and quite like the fighting route - do whatever the hell you want. 
         Given that this game is originally P2P, once you establish a good flow of income, its more than possible to purchase your subscriptions through the in game currency method. Expect at least a couple months P2P before thats viable though. All in all, its bloody good, but what i cannot stress enough is that this game is made for longitudinal play - Only buy it if you really think you will keep on at it. one skill can take months to train to max, and is usually a key skill required for *Thing you fancy doing* training.

Whether sitting back and watching the ISK roll in by mining, protecting/scourging other players and the spacelanes in general or building your own mini-trade empire, you can do it if you have the patence.
