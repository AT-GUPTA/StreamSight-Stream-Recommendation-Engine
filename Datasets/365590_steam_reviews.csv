If you ever need to reach out to Ubisoft Support, God help you because they won't. Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Worst DRM I've ever experienced. All my Ubisoft games are bricked because of their Ubisoft Connect system. Thanks. Avoid this company if possible 

What I said in 2016:
This is a fun game. The base game is alright. The story missions are alright. The side missions and events get a little repeative with different characters with a different quirk in each district telling you what to do. But all the events and the side missions in the regular world are pretty fast, so whatever. At least you don't have to climb a tower to unlock the map :P 

Besides the normal part of the game there is the Dark Zone. Which is a lot of fun and I recommend going there every 5 levels or so to get better gear. It's fun in groups and solo. The Dark Zone drops are good way to get gear or some pvp, but I recommend exploring the contaminated areas for loot, especially underground. There's also the Survival mode which is awesome solo or in a party! I wish these survival elements were in the base game.

I recently got to Endgame. Wow there is a lot of stuff to do in Endgame! A world tier system comes into play and the Underground expansion opens up. The Underground is extremely team based. Soloing is not recommended. 

Oh, Uplay exists. Yeah I know, that's a deal breaker for some. I've had problems with uplay before, but not recently. I still recommend this game even with uplay. Best to get it on sale like I did with the the Season Pass.",1482947413,1708878285,False,0,0,0.501661121845245361,0,True,False,False

the customization is also infuriatingly open.  i can use currency earned in-game to buy clothing and weapon skins. and theres a ton of options. dont see what you want? come back tomorrow.  itll still be purchaseable through what you earn within the game only.

The only big problem is that someone at Massive doesn't understand what difficulty means. So, don't think this is a tactical shooter. No matter what the PR says, it's not. It's a stat based looter shooter that is all about farming equipment with better stats to minmax your build for PvP. And if you don't have minmaxed builds for PvP, no amount of skill will save you in a gunfight against veteran players who've been at it for hundreds of hours more than you have. This also means that not having a minmaxed build makes it impossible to play missions on the highest difficulty.

This game definitely scratches that itch, and playing it now in 2023, it's kind of funny to think that this was originally released before COVID. The level progression is aight for a time killer, missions are recycled but good enough, navigating through the labyrinthine streets and buildings to get to objectives and enemies is actually pretty fun, combat movement is one of my favorite parts, weapons and equipment are fun to collect/build/deconstruct like pokemon for the best stats, world aesthetic is definitely the biggest plus, character customization options are rugged in gray or rugged in brownish gray.

Overall, it's not the most mind-blowing game I've played, but I got it for like $5 during the winter sale, and got what I was looking for, so I'll give it a rec.

Edit: After trying more of the game modes and more difficult areas, I'd say that the freedom to choose your play style is pretty well available. You can choose to stick to the more relaxed single-player action or with friends, or you can go into the PvP areas which are accessible to mid-levels which is reasonable. Definitely takes a bit of playtime to really see some of the more subtle triumphs of this game. Considering calling it a steal for $5 even having to go through the Ubi launcher and a somewhat basic story line.

Gotta say, it's a whole different game now and feels great. Very unique and interesting concept of a game/story. When it comes to character customization, there is not much for your character model but for cosmetics, there is so damn much, Which for me is a huge plus since I really enjoy choosing different pieces of gear to put on and make the character feel like my own masterpiece. It's really easy to understand how to play and whats going on with not a lot happening on your screen with the HUD being minimal as possible while not sacrificing vital information. In terms of gameplay, my only complaint is that there is a delay from when you fire you weapon and hit an enemy, to it actually having an effect on them. I would hit the enemies with a killing blow and their hit animation won't go through for about a whole second. It's not game breaking but it does feel weird.

Hostility is akin to love
Thinking of your opponent’s actions to fight,
Reading your opponent’s inner thoughts to fight,
Planning attacks that will hit your opponent to fight,
And then transmitting your thoughts with those attacks,
The more you think of your own advantage, at the same time you think of your opponent,
In the instant you mix with your opponent, a passionate feeling arises, and blood boils,
Reality is hurt, and you wound your opponent,
Hostility is akin to love.

After a deadly pandemic sweeps through New York, it's up to Agents to save what remains. Complete missions, explore the Dark Zone, and fight back enemy factions alone or with 3 friends. Experience a full endgame offering you new PvP and PvE modes.

The only thing I wish was better is the story.

     While being developed in 2016, The Division™ manages to encapsulate the full New York City experience, even in modern day. In my short field trip that was my time immersed in The Division™, I managed to feel right at home again! Trash bags piled higher than a kangaroo on its hind legs! Parked cars blocking the streets, which doors were almost always slightly open and me being the saint that I am, I closed them might I add. The Division™ is a game where you enter the daily life of your regular run of the mill New Yorker on their daily commute to work. However... I did feel like.

There is also different NPC factions that roam the area that, when spot each other, begin to engage in a battle.

Remains to be seen how the player amounts look like on PC nowadays when the game is old. At least to the some of the early missions it was hard to find players to play with, but then again these are rather simple and nice alone as well.

Every safe house hub in this game has its own theme and a contact who assigns you missions with his or her own developed personality. Contrast this with the sequel, where the safe houses are abandoned and empty and largely pointless. There is a real sense of survival and desperation as you trudge through the heavy snow, surrounded by ordinary citizens just trying to survive, which is completely missing from 2.

Not even judging it against the Division 2, I personally almost refunded less than an hour in because for whatever reason it will ONLY play in Windowed Mode and if I try to make it any version of fullscreen it freezes in the menu and you have to force quit the application.

Character creator is kind of sad. You can technically play as a girl but you can only have one of 4 very short haircuts. Long hair doesn't exist in post apocalyptic New York. Not even a bun or a ponytail to be allowed.

Gameplay is decent. The traversal is actually still better than Ghost Recon Breakpoint which is hilarious. It feels fluid and smooth. The gunplay also is fairly solid and fun, especially once you get some mods for some of the less accurate firearms. It feels punchy even on stronger enemies. 

Here's the big problem though, sometimes the ""Use Ability"" and the ""Heal"" buttons just don't function so be prepared to die if you think you can just heal when you're injured. Either it doesn't always function for some reason. Or the delay is so profound that I'm dying before the animation can play, but I doubt it, when it works it's fast, and it feels good. The heal button not working occassionaly is honestly the biggest problem here. You can really only solo this game now because people have moved on and not being able to heal 100% of the time on command is NOT okay for a AAA game.

Can't really recommend it, Division 2 is out and better in all respects. Hopefully Division 3 will allow more customization, or finally allow us to have red hair.",1702073894,1702680798,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Update on how i solve the issue, i just revert back to my initial driver installed on my laptop from the time i bought, and it just run so good that when the stutter or fps drop happen it will not crash the game, in fact it will back to responsive again after a few millisecond, so from here what i can said is if you still using pascal gpu or maybe a laptop version gpu, avoid any driver update, as it may not work well with your laptop hardware that bring more issue to you if you use other version driver that is not initially installed on your laptop.",1702299663,1702303411,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Since getting on PC I've found that The Last Stand released and so too had Global Events arrived. 

The only issue I have with this game truly stems from the fact that I don't enjoy MMORPG (even shooter types) without having someone to tag along, and quickly get bored roaming Manhattan without at least one other person to talk to as I came across random enemy factions. That said, this by no means dictates that the game is boring, and upon re-purchasing very quickly sank about 60-70 hours in the first week (give or take).

Advantages:
1. Festive city atmosphere. The festive atmosphere of Christmas, which did not take place, the winter landscape of New York. It feels as if time has stopped at the most interesting moment and you are trying to find a continuation by exploring the world around you. Also, the plot of the game is also well developed.
2. Mechanics. Convenient character control, enjoyable shooting, a huge selection of weapons and items, the ability to create different sets (builds).
3. Additional content (DLC). There are three DLCs for this game - the ""Survival"" mode (similar to the Hunger Games there you need to Survive in the NY in Storm), the Underground (an additional underground world of New York) and the Last Stand (additional invasions, new equipment and a new PVP mode are given).
4. Global events. These events occur approximately once a month and during the events you can collect rare builds for yourself.
Disadvantages:
1. Without proper support. The project was abandoned by the developers after the release of Division 2, although the possibility of creating Division 2 as an part of DLC to Division 1 was possible.
2. There is no new content. After support ended, the developers stopped creating new content for this game.
3. Audience. The total audience size is much smaller than it was before. On average, judging by Steam online statistics, up to 1000 thousand people play. It happens more, but it’s relatively rare, about once a month, when, for example, Global Events take place or there are discounts on the game. Also, there are cases of cheating on the part of players.

The sequel is an even better game, but the atmosphere of a cold Winter in New York cannot be beaten. The visuals still easily stand with the very best best on the PC, which shows how far ahIead of its time the Snowdrop engine was, way back in 2016. Maxed out at 4K, on an OLED, with Auto-HDR is a thing of beauty. The audio is also worth a mention because it really helps put you right in the game.

It can be quite a challenging game when played solo. You need to take your time and make sure you are suitably levelled up, otherwise named elite enemies will make mincemeat of you. The game does a good job of introducing you to the various mechanics and it is highly addictive. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of shooters.

Despite being an old game, it will still make even a good PC sweat on the highest settings, but it is very well optimised and I haven't had a single crash in all my time playing it. I have tried both the DX11 & DX12 modes, and both are absolutely reliable and perform well.

It's really good with its story but there is always that time where bots are shooting you through stuff that makes no sense to the game. Yeah I love this game and I will be definitely buying The Division 2 Gold Edition. What does suck is that its really limited to stuff, what I mean is there is not a lot choices to your character (In the beginning of the game). I am disppointed after for awhile in the campaign, what I mean with that is. That once your at like level 15 or higher the game will get boring and just basic stuff. And the clothing and hats are just very little to it. I focus mostly on graphics looks and story. But the story is very good but just very bad at the same time.

Edit: 
2023 Review - Division 2 should've been a DLC to division 1. Division 2 is not as good, probably because of the summer nature or something. Just something is off about it. 
The game today have dead servers and still is dependent on servers of online only systems which is very stupid. I bought the gold edition of the game and never played the DLC stuff back then til now. Well I would say now but I never get a chance to play the DLC at all. I wanted to play Survival so bad because it shows the potential of what Division should really be. Much more survival like. 

You are still selling this game yet you can't play the content you paid for. DLC is not an option at all. Some require as a ""main mission"" So you never actually finish the game because of it. This game needs an update to allow offline mode and dedicated servers. What would be really cool is a mod community for this game. This game still has a lot to offer. Just Ubisoft is lazy and greedy. Waste away games and since its online only, this game will shut down one day because of Ubisoft. I am blaming them for this reason. So much potential just goes to wate.

Winter 2023: „It's That Time of Year Again.“

————————————————————————

I played this game hundreds of hours on my PS4. It was also fun getting the platinum trophy for this.

I made the platinum trophy during christmas 2018 and after all these years I came finally back theseholidays and man, the nostalgia hit me like a baseball bat straight in my face. 

I would say it is my favorite game during the Christmas holidays because of the great winter atmosphere that is truly unique.

It has become even more intense as we are all currently living in a similar pandemic.

Tom Clancy's The Division, developed by Ubisoft Massive and released in 2016, thrusts players into a meticulously crafted vision of a post-pandemic New York City. As a member of the Strategic Homeland Division (SHD), your mission is to restore order and investigate the source of the catastrophic outbreak that has decimated the city. The game combines elements of third-person shooting, RPG mechanics, and a dynamic multiplayer experience to create a compelling and immersive online action game.

The most striking aspect of The Division is its meticulously recreated open-world environment. The snow-covered streets of New York City serve as a hauntingly beautiful backdrop to the chaos that ensues. From the dilapidated buildings to the eerily abandoned streets, the level of detail in the game's environment is nothing short of impressive. Dynamic weather conditions and day-night cycles add an extra layer of realism, creating an immersive atmosphere that keeps players engaged throughout their journey.

Gameplay in The Division revolves around a blend of cover-based shooting and RPG elements. The cover system is intuitive and crucial for survival, encouraging tactical thinking and strategic positioning during firefights. The RPG mechanics allow players to customize their character's skills, abilities, and equipment, providing a sense of progression and personalization. The loot system is robust, rewarding players with a constant stream of gear upgrades and weapons to enhance their agent's effectiveness in the field.

The multiplayer aspect of The Division is a key component of its appeal. The game seamlessly integrates both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. In the PvE ""Dark Zone,"" players can collaborate to tackle challenging AI enemies and acquire high-level loot, but the risk of betrayal from other players adds an element of tension and unpredictability. This dynamic creates a sense of camaraderie and distrust, enhancing the overall multiplayer experience.

In conclusion, Tom Clancy's The Division is a standout title in the online action genre. Its immersive open-world design, engaging gameplay mechanics, and dynamic multiplayer experiences create a captivating and evolving gaming landscape. Despite a few initial shortcomings, ongoing support from the developers has ensured that The Division remains a compelling and ever-expanding journey into the heart of a post-pandemic urban battleground. Whether playing solo or teaming up with friends, The Division offers an unforgettable and thrilling experience in a world on the brink of collapse.",1700748461,1700748461,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Aside from minor bugs, it's a totally upgraded version and makes up for it's awful launch back in March.

Glad to see the reviews going back up. If you're still unsure of this game try to pick it up on sale or check out recent gameplay.

1.6.1 Update was fun to play, still minor server issues with skill registry.

[strike]Will update at 1.7.[/strike]

So, with patch 1.8 on it's way 1.7 has been pretty solid so far, new builds to try with out with gear changes. This past month or so though as they have been working on fixes for numerous bugs/gltiches that needed attention. However there's a lot more work to be done and I do wonder if the community is being heard. I'll probably invest more time in this game towards the future.

[strike]Will update at 1.8.[/strike]

1.8/1.8.5 Update has brought many additional things to the game. New legendary missions, returning global events, and Division Shield rewards. 

With the announcement at E3 for the The Division 2, it's safe to say we will be getting a ""headstart"" by earning the Shield rewards (a form of Patch cosmetic that can be found in the dossier) in our current release for The Division. Since these will be carrying over to the next game, I say it's worth it to go for since they aren't too difficult but perhaps time consuming, which is perfect if any of you were burnt out from the current endgame and wanting some more flavorful new gameplay challenges.

Perhaps the closing chapters for this first game will pave the way for it's sequel.

Here's to looking forward...

It IS a PURE grind, by design. There's very little co-op here now in 2023...everyone is playing solo, and that's fine. It's generally how I prefer to play games these days.

Being an older game, the big bonus is, you can max everything on graphics etc. 

Bottom line. It's not a Far Cry or Ghost Recon style game...if that's what your after. BUT, it is very playable, IF you are prepared to be, or are, a grinder. I've got about 30+ hours invested already, and win or lose, I'm going to ""grind"" on until I get to the level 30 ""god"" point. So, maybe another 30-40 hours play-time. That in it's self is enough to justify the ""on-sale"" price in terms of hours of play per buck.

Just....don't expect to run amok from the beginning. And, definitely, don't stray outside your level looking for glory, or quick rewards.

Will I play Division 2? Hell yes!!!! I Got it as part of the deal on this one. ;o)

Update:
Finally got past level 30, although past 30 is a bit of a misnomer. Once you beat level 30...man, what a lot of great ""stuff"" becomes available. Much better weapons, much better gear etc. You can really do some ""serious"" damage in the game.

365590,35549527,76561198333502920,0,13,8520,0,8520,1695589614,"""The Division"" is a third-person shooter that throws you into the heart of a post-pandemic New York City, and Ubisoft has really nailed the immersive and visually striking gaming experience.

The depiction of the virus-stricken city is jaw-dropping. The level of detail in the urban landscape, from the snow-covered streets to the crumbling buildings, creates a hauntingly beautiful setting. The dynamic weather and day-night cycle add an extra layer of realism that pulls you into the atmosphere.

Now, let's talk about the multiplayer – it's the heart and soul of ""The Division."" Team up with fellow agents to tackle tough missions, engage in intense firefights, and navigate through the chaos of a city in crisis. The focus on teamwork and strategy makes for a dynamic and immersive multiplayer adventure.

The RPG elements, like character customization and skill trees, are a sweet spot. Completing missions and grabbing loot allows you to fine-tune your agent's abilities and gear to fit your playstyle. The variety of weapons and equipment keeps the gameplay deep and constantly engaging.

The Dark Zone is where the adrenaline really kicks in. A PvP area with high-stakes rewards, it's a thrilling mix of risk and reward. The uncertainty of encountering other players who might be allies or enemies creates unforgettable moments of tension and excitement.

The narrative, while not groundbreaking, keeps you invested. The unraveling mystery of the pandemic and the power struggles in the city add a layer of intrigue to the overall story.

Okay, on the downside, the endgame content at the game's launch felt a bit lacking. But credit where it's due, subsequent updates and expansions have tackled this issue head-on, introducing new activities and challenges for us seasoned players.

In a nutshell, ""The Division"" delivers an immersive cocktail of storytelling, cooperative multiplayer action, and satisfying RPG progression. The visually stunning depiction of a pandemic-ridden New York City, combined with engaging gameplay, makes it a must-try for fans of third-person shooters and cooperative multiplayer adventures.",1507394746,1700654395,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Just a unique setting with a great story, fantastic even. 
Atmosphere is awesome, especially if you play with limited UI or turn it completely off, You need to setup to get most out of it. Turn on neutral lighting setting, the night time will be more accurate otherwise it is too bright.
This game has great attention to details, Very asset heavy game, majority of the world was hand crafted with attention to details.
Story feels heavy, daunting and it should capture your attention if you are looking for a really well fleshed out fiction and fictional world to explore. The Division will reward your never ending desire to explore very well. 
Original score for the game is sublime, Characters, voice acting, sound effects, weather effects, the day night/cycle, all these are very well done and they help to create just absolutely awesome atmosphere.

Oh yeah, and the first one is better than the second one when it comes to single player. There is no competition here really, second one is kind of trash.

Okay so, the UI is mostly fine when you play the story. Once that is done and you start properly gear up for the ""end game"", the UI is a complete trash, just garbage, one of the worst UI implementations ever. It is a nightmare to handle large amounts of weapons and pieces of gear you can loot in this game. The UI is this console bound nightmare of the modern gaming, mostly just trash. 

I think that at some point in the development they decided to add ""loot"" and ""RPG"" elements in to the game, This is not an RPG nor a ""looter game"", whatever that is. The UI and the gameplay mechanics do not accommodate these aspects well at all. Looting and RPG elements are tact on rather than being part of the game. This game is a third person shooter first and foremost.

The end game really begins when you have all the weapons and pieces of gear. At that point you can start playing Legendary missions however you like it. These missions are incredibly fun, they are very intense and just a blast to complete. The problem is however that the gearing up process takes forever and is incredibly boring, because this is just a third person shooter and not a Diablo, the gameplay is completely different. It is easier now to gear up than it was before, because ability to buy Classified Cache was added. It takes way too long to gear up, if you spend 20 to 50 hours on story it might take up to 800 hours or more to start playing highest available difficulties with all builds and weapons available.

Obviously 99% of the loot is absolute trash so you need to manage that and the UI is not made for that, it does not display well a lot of different information.
This is one of those ""looter this and that"" games that in the end have no space to store all available pieces of equipment. Even three additional characters is not enough and you only get four in total.

(Gameplay has improved quite a bit since its rocky launch almost three years earlier. I have been told so by veteran players who started playing in beta stage then left a year in then came back after new content was added; by new content, I mean the game was overhauled).[/b]

[b]Things I like about it:[/b]
[i]- The feel of running around NYC is amazing. The ambiance is like no other game I've played. Super immersive and fun.
- This is the best PC RPG multiplayer experience I've had. Great coop as long as you commit to staying equal level. I've levelled multiple characters with friends after playing through the game on my own first and it's still a blast to try and shoot our way through the story missions.
- Combat is strategic and the AI is smart enough. Enemies at early levels are pretty dumb and the later enemies will use cover/stun grenades/rocket launchers to make your life hell. For me the challenge is perfect. I've not felt safe OR overpowered at equal level (short of endgame set gear anyway...)[/i]

[b]Couple gripes:[/b]
[i]- Menus were made for console and they SUCK for PC. Laggy, sometimes buggy, and you can only see ~5 things at a time on the screen. Really needs a bag mod from an MMO or something.
- Gear-splosion is really overwhelming at first. Stick it out! It gets better when you recognize what you need, but it's a rough learning curve and you'll spend a lot of time inside those (abysmally designed) menus.
- The inventory system is annoying. You can carry up to 120 items in your backpack and another 150 in your stash box (that's for a fully leveled-up character). But here's the thing, the amount of loot in this game is insane, of course you select and deconstruct/sell all that you don't and won't need but still it's such a hassle. You won't understand until you play yourself and see how you keep those precious Classified Gear pieces that drop and they fill your pack :) The game lets you play and level up four characters, so do the numbers and you'll see it's not so bad as long as you level up at least two characters. I did that and now I'm on my third character, taking it very slow and enjoying the game through the lense of a somewhat vet player :)
- The server sometimes gives you an error called Delta blablabla. It gets annoying but the redeeming aspect here is that my game is always saved automatically and that when I log back in I'm at almost the exact spot.[/i]

[b]Overall, I'm really enjoying the game! I hope they can keep the content coming. There are tons of possibilities with this game.[/b]

Fast forward...

Now we are headed to patch 1.8, which is bringing a whole new life to the game! with new game areas with 4v4 matches, new map areas to explore, to mention a few. 
Unfortunately the rouge mechanics are also changing ... A.K.A Rouge 2.0 which requires you to activate rouge status in the DZ and finding a location to clear your rouge status vs. a timer that runs out. Time will tell if this was a wise choice for the direction of the DZ or not. Other than Rouge 2.0, the updates can be played on the PTS and updates are expected in the coming weeks! Still playing it!

Fast forward .....

Yup, still playing this one! I've maxed out 4 characters and pretty much have everything in the game, something about this looter shooter keeps bringing me back! Check it out, wont disappoint. DZ is a bit of a hit or miss if you looking at the PvP part of the game. The PvE for the most part is fun and even more fun with a set of friends!!! :td_Hazard:

Fast forward yet again.... here it is 2021, still love going back to this game and just playing, holds a firm position as one of my all time favorite games I never get tired of playing!  Unfortunately the second part of the franchise didn't leave me as satisfied but still return to play it on occasion.:td_Hazard:

Yup, 2023, still playing it, jump in the occasional PvE/Solo Survival mode or just work on making the streets safe again!

so in short: PvE is OK but if you are going to get this game, get it while is dirty cheap (or free)

but if you like PvP ? well look somewhere else! cheater everywhere. i'm not talking about PvP junky that play this all day that are just good, nope, i talk about people flying, teleporting, shooting so fast that they spay bullets 3 times what it should be possible, downing the entire server by themself in half a second then teleporting outside the zone to avoid being in manhunt! you wont be able to get item in there. even if you report a cheater ingame or by their online form (with link to solid video proof), its gonna be ignored, no one gonna watch the evidence you provide ( tested and validated by ubisoft support themself )

then if its not the cheater, it'll be the PvP junky that watch for extraction all day (extraction appear on the map, everybody can see it). they just gonna explode you when you try to extract the loot you farmed... with their shiny maxed out PvP build, optimised as much as possible, they will glitch run (run faster than was intended), they will glitch door (exit DZ for a 1/4 of a second to remove rogue/manhunt status), they will glitch wall (hide into solid wall to avoid getting killed) you'll have no chance against them.

if by any chance you are able to down one, he's gonna hunt you non-stop just to prove ""something"" ( the side of his ... ego? ).

so i don't recommend this game, not because people cheat, not because its ""bad"" or people are toxic...nope! just because ubisoft stopped supporting it. yeah its a old game but they still sell it, they make money, they should still fixing MAJOR glitch or at least ban cheater? in fact i dont recommend ANY of their games because they do this for most of their games (drop support).",1606083574,1700101063,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

By its premise, The Division ponders the question of what happens to society when the human condition regresses and begins to prioritize the self over the many. As far as elevator pitches go, it’s not exactly ground-breaking content, but despite that it’s still one that I think many developers are hesitant to try to work with. It is, after all, very easy to write misery, and pain, and suffering; to kick something while it’s down. Covid gave us a mere taste of the fear and anguish that a pandemic can wreak, and to simply relay that to the player is trivial. On the other hand, to use that grief and then transform it into something evocative and exalting is the more daunting task, but it is a challenge that [i]everything[/i] in The Division was so well setup to handle. I think that’s what burns me the most about this game.

Unlike most games in the genre, The Division is not a post-apocalyptic game. Rather, it exists somewhere in the twilight between the beginning and the end, peering into the heart of chaos where mankind has begun to turn upon itself, giving rise to all its demons — but there are still some vestiges of humanity left in the world, and with them lie the last dwindling rays of hope. Massive’s art teams have done incredible work portraying this: In front of my PC at a comfortable 68 degrees, I feel the chill of a snowstorm as it rolls down the street and smothers the block with fog and swirling snow; strings of colored lights twinkle over the blacked-out cityscape; blood and soot stain fluffy white snowdrifts; music lilts from a discarded boombox, at once soft and tender, and then punctuated by staccato cracks of gunfire. These are not mere remnants of a civilization long since decayed, but the gurgling deathbed coughs of their society, desperate to hold on to their humanity in a world that values it less and less with each passing day.

The Division is lauded for the art direction of its setting, and it is well-deserved praise, but I think most reviews miss the target on [i]why[/i] it’s to be commended. The contrast in these scenes is not merely a visual quality leveraged to make an interesting picture. It is not just beauty to be systematically admired and then dismissed, and nor was the setting some arbitrary choice because “winter looks cool”. Rather, it is an active part of the narrative that holds up the themes of the game despite all of its mishandling, and it would all come crumbling down in its absence. 

Manhattan as we know it is gone, and what is left teeters on the edge of a knife; it’s not the end of the world, but you can see it from 7th ave. This winter is a bitter and isolating cold, rebuffed only by the fleeting warmth of memory — of the love of our people and the communal joy drawn out by the holidays, be they family, friends, or a passing stranger. It's a tantalizing reminder of what was lost and must be taken back, and an anchor to which we can tie ourselves in order to weather the storm — or, perhaps we will drown with it in our sorrow. The question the game wants to pose is, will you save it, or plunge the knife deeper? The Dark Zone, a PvP area where you compete for loot, is a functional embodiment of this theme, and it is what the game seems to have been developed to set up: The prevailing struggle of life even in the looming face of its almost certain doom, and how brave one must be to hold fast to hope. Rage, rage against the dying of the light, all ye good men.

It is environmental storytelling at its finest, and it is wasted on Ubisoft.

[h3]Spoilers Ahead[/h3]

In what is possibly the biggest fumble of its decade, Ubisoft saw all of the incredible potential that the setting offered.. and instead opted for the safest route straight down the middle, taking great pains to avoid shaking things up to any degree. The result is a sterilized story bereft of any intrigue and devoid of any ups or downs, though certainly not for lack of talent, mind. In fact, there’s tons of interesting story in the game!.. Just, not the story that you actually get to play. Instead, all of The Division’s interesting bits are portrayed through any of various collectibles: audio diaries, call logs, and ECHOs (a novel way of digitally reconstructing a scene) being the primary sources. One of my favorite audio logs is a first-person recounting from a college-aged man left on his brother’s voicemail. The first entry is carefree, telling his brother about a woman he had met, and asking his brother to spin a tale to their mother about how busy he is at college — typical student stuff. The next six voicemails detail his life throughout the pandemic: the spread of the sickness, his girlfriend’s symptoms and subsequent passing, scavenging the city and mugging an old man for supplies. By the end of it, he’s desperately warning his brother to get out of town, so as to avoid people like him. These (and the environment itself) are what carried the game for me, but they are too short and easily missed to be leveraged as a vehicle for any truly complex story.

Instead, what you get is just shy of twenty nondescript missions (sole standout being the Russian consulate, which happened to have nice-looking gold crown moldings), where you are tasked with holding the F key on any of a number of control panels before taking on an equally unmemorable boss — and since the bosses are just regular humans (sometimes wearing hockey pads, sometimes not) with an unusual appetite for bullets, the ludonarrative dissonance hits you like a freight train. At the end of the mission, one of your mission handlers calls you on the radio to say “Hey good job, that did something,” and off you go to the next glowing icon on the map. You know that archetype of a terrible DnD player who doesn’t understand how to roleplay and just casts fireball at everything? That’s The Division, except replace fireball with any of a plethora of functionally identical guns. The water pumps are out and the food is all gone, and the civilians are dying of exposure? Damn, that sucks, you should shoot random looters about it.

Arguably, this isn’t so far off what many other games do if you boil it down a bit — after all, there’s only so many ways a player can realistically interact with a game before the scope creep becomes unrealistic — but the issue for The Division is that all of these things happen in a vacuum. As an example: One of the missions tasks you with retaking a power plant so that the lights in the city stay on, and you are told this is a very big issue and people could suffer if you don’t. Mind, you have to be told this because otherwise you would never know, as the lights all seem to be doing okay and nobody is complaining about losing power. While you’re fighting at the power plant, the bad guys threaten to blow up the facility if they’re not allowed to keep hold on it — and you may have missed this if you weren’t listening, because it plays over a fairly quiet intercom and you’re busy spraying thousands of bullets in a building full of sensitive equipment — and what’s more, they even succeed in doing some damage! Fortunately, it is all fixed up by the time you leave the power plant thirty seconds later, and the civilian populace is none the wiser for your efforts. At the end of the mission, you get a data dump that one of your friends on the radio has somehow already decrypted and put together a Powerpoint on, and you are treated to about fifteen seconds of action movie footage of stuff you probably already know just by existing in the world. Suffice it to say that I actually don’t need to be told via video clip that the people who are wandering Manhattan with flamethrowers and burning people alive are, in fact, [i]bad people[/i] who wander Manhattan with flamethrowers and burn people alive. This is self-evident.

First time playing it in PS4 back in 2017, at first this game has a lot of potential. That is after I saw the mediocre review about this game, such as unbalanced gameplay, unpromising graphics detail, rock-solid AI that was OP at launch, always online and many more complaints.

So, I bought this game on PC for a bit of nostalgia, and actually, it is not as disappointing as back then. The snowy background of NYC was just mesmerizing with a combinations of chaos and modern dystopia of what it looks like when the city almost completely deserted because of a pandemic (somehow ring a bell?). Loot system is also been vitalized nicely, a good set of character customization (even though it was a loot-box type.) and a very aggressive AI that still looks like a tank, but capable to break. The Dark Zone, however, is still hardcore and difficult as I've remember. Good thing I did not stumble upon an OP and toxic player somehow, as the DZ is rarely show anyone playing these old games.

Truthfully, I'm an avid Division player, but not in a competitive way. I'm still playing this game up to Division 2 on both PS4 and PC just to loot something worth to calibrate to the best form possible.

[h3]Only after rebuying and replaying it so many years later, I realize how utterly bad it really is.[/h3]

[b]1. One of the worst control systems ever engineered for a third-person shooter.[/b]
The utter clusterf**k of controls in Division 1 is a pain to endure for the entirety of the experience. Despite key rebinding options, it won't get any better. Especially in combat, every action feels clunky and slow, particularly those related to movement and skills usage. Overly-long animations and bizarre hard-binds, such as double-tapping the cover button to dodge-roll instead of having a dedicated key for dodging, add even more misery to your journey. In the heat of battle, don't be surprised if you'll mistakenly vault a cover instead of using it, or perform one of the bizarre, useless, time-wasting ""tacticool"" cover-to-cover moves that will only get you killed, due to their ridiculously long execution times. You won't 'get used' to it, you will only suffer. Devs, this is not a tactical shooter, this isn't Ready Or Not and it's not paced appropriately to be one - yet, the actions pacing - yours at least, while enemies act as fast as a greased-up Irishman at times - seems to be set for that standard.

[b]2. There never is a true sense of build progression or specialization. That's because of how terribly designed progression is as a whole.[/b]
The Division wanted to do something new, by forsaking the standard class archetypes of regular ""Looter Shooters"" (terrible term, by the way) / Action RPGs and instead, allowing players to mix and match active and passive skills, alongside armor and weapon traits, to create their custom builds. On paper it sounds great, but at the end of the day this system has one big issue: it takes away the identity of single, specialized classes in favor of blander, shallower builds that, as specialized on some aspects they may become thanks to sets and specific Exotic weapons, will never feel like standalone classes with their own identity on the field. Don't even get me started on the amount of grinding for those exotics, either. 

Basically the designers thought that giving more freedom, by diluting and bloating the total available skill / trait pool would, in the end, result in more diversity for the end user, without the need to commit to a specific build and sticking to it (like in most other RPGs, where you choose a class / a hero and that's it). Well, that ended up backfiring, making everything shallower with very little upsides. During your journey from level 1 to 30, you won't feel like you have passed milestones that further define your playstyle, you won't feel like you have been doing some real progress; it will be the same weapons and skills you'll unlock relatively soon, only upscaled due to higher level stats.

[b]3. PvP (Dark Zone) is a terrible, flawed, issue-ridden experience you will not enjoy.[/b]
Implementing PvP as a main game mechanic / mode in this type of game is pointless enough, given how success is far more gear-dependent / build-dependent than actually skill-dependent, but let's say you're suicidal or naive enough to want and try PvP - don't. Seriously, don't do that. Let me describe you the worst crock of s**t imaginable: the Dark Zone, a large part of the map which is dedicated to a PvPvE (so that means hostile NPCs and players all in the same area) experience. 

Do you like to endlessly roam to find that specific Dark Zone-exclusive named enemy that drops that particular piece of gear  / weapon (MAYBE, drop rates are dogs**t in general for Named / Exotic stuff), only get gang-banged by a group of 3 people while being solo? Do you like people having permanent wallhack because it's one of the actual skills in the game? Do you like horrible netcode that wasn't structured nor programmed with PvP in mind, screwing you over with miserable hit detection and trash polling rate every other fight? If the answer is yes, then you only live to suffer, and I salute you, but you still shouldn't play PvP in this game.

Icing on the cake? Some of the legitimately best gear to have is ONLY dropped in Dark Zone, but it's not worth the pain of this mess. You CAN do without. And you better.

[b]4. Far too much repetition in enemies and mission archetypes, even for this genre.[/b]
The definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over again. In addition to all of the above, you'll be facing enemies that much too soon become very repetitive, with even the majority of Named and Boss tier ones being only upscaled archetypes of normal ones, just with a whole lot more health, damage and abilities on steroids. In comparison, Borderlands, to name another ""looter shooter"" most normies will know, is highly varied in this aspect. That says all, I think. The same goes for missions; there will hardly ever be unique ones, and anything outside of main missions, which do have some more uniqueness from time to time, will be a slog to grind, again, I know this RPG subgenre is meant to be like that to some extent, but Division 1 takes that extent far past what is acceptable.

[b]5. Uninteresting story with anonymous, forgettable characters.[/b]
Granted, story shouldn't be taken as a main expectation from this genre of game, but at least some effort should be made to make it at least tolerable or somewhat pleasant. While the atmosphere regarding level design, and the detail, effort put into building the environments are all highly remarkable, credit where it's due, the story surrounding these evocative locations will never be more than mediocre, or at worst, listless. I didn't remember a single character from my 2016 playthrough - no surprise there. 

So that's all folks. I wanted to focus more on why you shouldn't play this game rather than why you should. Simply because I felt like that for this review. Until next time.",1698547967,1698547967,False,45,6,0.61989128589630127,3,True,False,False

I can go thorugh the main story missions with almost not needing to do any side mission at all and I don't get stuck. (2) The HUD by default is overly populated for my taste (where to cover, where to jump, everything occupies space on the screen). It is quite configurable on the settings menu, I disabled most features of the HUD and it is a lot more immersive now. (3) With the focus on multiplayer, the main story line (which is the part that I personally am interested on) I was afraid was going to be bland. It is not so bland. It is not great, but it is good enough to really enjoy the game playing alone.

Pros: Entertaining game with a nice setting. Playing the main story, exploring the open world devastated new york with the encounters, is awesome. Fully recommend this game if you like the main stories in Destiny 2 as me.

I own this on Xbox and put a lot of time into it there wanted to replay the story and bought a Steam Deck. Did a play through on there before diving back into Division 2. Smaller screen makes it a little tricky... but it worked, all 60+ hours were on the deck.

Good story, beautiful landscape, but not for everyone. It's a grind and if you're looking for Call of Duty, this isn't it. For the story you don't have to partake much in the different builds, you can casually upgrade your equipment as you go. The Dark Zone is still active, but people are far and few, which I actually liked. Good game, worth it especially on a good sale.

You do need the Ubisoft Connect and the game requires online connection... which is a pain sometimes. You'll have to look up adding Ubisoft Connect to Steam Deck (pretty easy) and make sure you have wifi or a hotspot to play on the deck.",1698387818,1698387818,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I installed the game and it runs OK and whatever but as soon as I was able to start shooting and moving the game would immediately crash.

Weird but OK, try again different settings, still crashing. Verify integrity of the game and try again and ""Uplay is not installed, please install Uplay"" so I reinstall Uplay and the game starts properly again.

Try changing to DX12 and going into windowed, still crashes. Try launching again and ""Uplay is not installed again"" so I try to reinstall it again and the Uplay installer crashes.

Uplay then actually installs, I can boot the game again but then shooting crashes the game.

I give up and go to sleep, after I wake up and try again today the game for some reason now just works.

I have no clue why, it just suddenly started working and all is well.

Play for an hour and the servers have gone down despite the fact I'm playing Single Player and don't want to play with others.

However smaller teams and solo players will probably find it really tedious starting out, having to cheese bosses and occasionally finding an overland skirmish exploding into a huge firefight and getting attacked from all sides because nearby enemies are attracted to the gunfire.

It is an electrifying, edge-of-your-seat, and might I add, uncannily prophetic experience where I am definitely not going to admit that I played any part in the ensuing chaos.

In this nation that is on life support, society is hanging by a thread, and it is akin to watching a political thriller turned up to eleven. I would never acknowledge that my leadership may have had anything to do with the state of affairs.

As players get their boots on the ground, they are taking up the mantle of elite agents who are valiantly trying to clean up the mess – though, between you and me, it is those agents who should take the heat. After all, the commander-in-chief does not shoulder any responsibility for the nation's current predicament.

This game is a stark reminder that leadership, in all its glory, can be a two-way street, and the repercussions of one's actions are like ripples in a pond.

Seen a lot of mixed thoughts about this game over the years but never really got an idea of what it was about. The sale on it prompted me to look into it, and after getting a rundown of the general premise it convinced me to buy. Here are my thoughts so far for anyone else who might be considering picking up the title for the first time.

I would best compare the game-play as ""Destiny 2 meets The Last of Us"". Its sort of a looter shooter where the ""multiplayer"" aspect is fulfilled by players operating within hubs in the overworld and being able to join you for missions, but they're not populating the city, in the same was as Destiny where you'll be doing series of quests within an overworld. The Last of Us aspect referencing not only the post apocalyptic city setting but also the cover heavy 3rd person shooting.

Here are the main points of interest so far:

[list]
[*] The game graphically still holds up, but it feels rare today that a game has made my eyes feel so spoiled for choice when it comes to overworld detailing. There is so much environmental storytelling to appreciate, its all really good

[*] The premise of the story hooked me in immediately, especially after the pandemic it hits pretty hard. New York always looks good in the winter IMO, this game is no exception

[*] So far, the combat seems very easy, but only under the conditions of cover. I've played few games in recent memory that emphasized playing strategically with your environment this well besides maybe XCOM 2

[*] The UI, while admittedly very overcrowded, deserves to be praised for how well it communicate information tactfully while keeping it very ""high tech"". Maybe a little too high tech for 2018, but fuck it. Its fantasy, it looks good
[/list]

I know it sounds like Im sucking Ubisoft's dick with this review, but I'm honestly very impressed by this game. It seems a lot of people feel it didn't live up to what was demo'd or just hate Ubisoft (fair), but for the new player I can definitely appreciate it for what it is.

TL;DR: 9/10 (so far) Absolutely pick it up on sale, if not then buy it if you like a Destiny style grind.",1697853306,1697853306,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The setting and play style of the game is better than I remember thanks to a couple of updates i wasnt around for. As for the gameplay, the gun play is still great from what I remember. Lots of different blueprints for weapons and mods can be found in the massive world and modified to fit your play style. As for the campaign before you reach level 30, it can be kinda repetitive at times. Luckily the different guns you collect and new abilities you unlock keep it fresh trying to figure out what works good for you. I remember this game being very difficult for solo players at launch, but playing through the game a second time has taught me that while some of the enemies you come across will just absorb bullets its not as hard on a solo player as I remember. Survival is still one of the best game modes in any  Tom Clancy game even tho there is very little luck finding a game with other players.

The pros:

 +Graphics are stunning, and it runs very well on low end pcs [30-45fps]
 
 +Players in DZ are mostly very friendly [I guess its mainly because they're either new and don't want trouble or just prefer to be passive]

 +Hard mode is actually hard, a little bit unfair at times but overall I'm somewhat of a masochist. Play  at your own sanity with enemies that takes 10 trillion bullets to shred through armor. You'll need your gadget, trust me.

The cons:

  -Connection takes a very long time. Seriously, I had to wait 10 minutes to load in the character screen sometimes. That is, if it doesn't hit me with a BS error because Ubi has shitty servers.
I can assure you 1/3th of my playtime stems from the loading simulator this game sometimes puts me through.
 
  -Loading times for some area takes a whopping 1 minute to load sometimes, you can't run nor hide in the loading area in the meantime. This can be absolutely detrimental in DZ as you'll need a sniper to deal some form of damage while you're stuck walking or jogging in the meantime to the preloaded area. I highly recommend going with a team so they can deal main damage while you support and wait for the area to load. 

 -You best bet you don't accidentally walk inside of an object while its loading, else you're stuck. That's it, you're stuck. Better nade yourself to sleep.

Speaking of atmosphere, it's literally the main selling point of the game for me, New York and Washington (In the second one) are it's own characters with it's weather and time of day, it's still really impressive to see the heavy, HEAVY fog in these two games and this is the main thing it drawed me into this, I wish this was in some other game, because the division is not it.

Why do I say this? It's the most common criticism for this series but it's true, it's so frustrating to see this game being an rpg like everything that ubisoft makes, why isn't this a survival game? It could be so good if they took away the bullet sponges, I mean there can still be loot of course, but the bullet sponges with aimbot are such a turn-off! I do understand people like this a lot, but I don't and it takes away a lot from this game to me, it could be so much better in my eyes, and it sucks that there is not an option that could toggle that BS on or off, not everything can be an RPG, same problem with Assasins Creed and some other ubi games with its damage numbers, and padding to feed a game that shouldn't need it, it's already massive. I have an idea, why not make the weapons jam, or just fucking explode like in Far Cry 2 I.E one of if not the best ubi game (played on ps3 btw)

The game primarily revolves around running the same missions repeatedly and collecting a whopping 331 different types of collectibles, with dialogue that fails hard to add meaningful depth to the story. I even stumbled upon a Easter egg that referenced a summoning to Cthulhu while pursuing phones, which was surprisingly more captivating than going after collectibles.

The story attempt to make you care about characters without providing sufficient reasons to invest in their fates. You're expected to empathize with their losses and hardships, but it's challenging when you haven't had the chance to truly get to know them and their personal stories. SPOILER: [spoiler]The Division agents are introduced without any prior context or connection, you just know they exist and have their families, making it difficult to feel emotionally invested in their betrayal. You can even argue that they had valid reasons for their actions, further blurring the lines of loyalty and motivation.[/spoiler]

Enemies can get glitched inside buildings which lead to mission failures. While using incendiary grenades can sometimes solve this issue, it shouldn't be a recurring problem.

In conclusion, it offers moments of fun, but it's marred by repetitive tasks, a lackluster storyline, and occasional technical hiccups. If you can overlook these flaws, there's still enjoyment to be had.",1695991957,1695992094,False,52,1,0.671156048774719238,0,True,False,False

It's also much better than the sequel release imo if you're interested in this but see Division 2 pop up. They pulled a classic Destiny 2 move and reworked/redid so much that this game did right.

Suprisingly enough i find that the Division feels better and more grounded than the Division 2. I just hope they eventually just reboot their little genre as there is still a growing community, hungry for such games. 

Something the Division 2 kinda screwed up.

The Division 2 isn't as simple as it's predecessor. I played the Division 2 and enjoyed it but it always was crazy how i felt bombarded with contnet and didn't know what to do next (that happened after i finished with the campaign and the warlords of New York DLC). It is simply too complicated and made the RPG elements uncomfortably compley and in-depth. Especially the optimization stations. The Grind is painful. (not even Destiny 2 is that grindy).

Division 2's multiuplayer issue.

Sure it's a good looking game with lots of things to do. But mostly... you'll just see yourself playing through it all alone. I played their new rouge-like mode and barley had any filled sessions. Because there is too much for such a small playerbase and you cannot expect every activity to be brim-filled with matchmaking people. It is fair to say that atleast 73% of your playtime will be solo and the rest wil be random matchmaking with 1 guy or a full squad.
Something the Divison Did right was that while the content was lackluster, people always managed to get into a session. Even nowadays. You will almost always find a squad to play through daily challenges or global events because it's not a grind-fest with multiple different daily objectives and battlepass tasks like the Division 2 has.

not to mention the only grind modes in the division are underground, survival and resistance aswell as the raids like falcon lost. Those are 4 different modes which is quite frankly enough in my opinion.

About the Division

The reason i like the Division more than the Division two is mostly that micro-transactions are held to a minimum aswell as the atmosphere and lore being pretty stated and rooted overall. You are an agent who is trying to put law and order back into manhattan. You get to kill some crazy factions that have different believes in how to take care of the virus or taking care of themselves. You also have like only 2 factions that are thinking of taking over manhattan which is the LMB and Rikers.

The Divison 2 lore is basically. You are manhunting gang leaders of like countless factions that wanna take over Washington D.C for themselves, like.... Hello??? The virus is barley mentioned so the military could probably take over already like god dayum. But thats probably just me idk. Game is basically ""take this new fancy gun and do a crime"". You are now just playing search and destroy with a floaty story.

LOOT

The Division had the following in terms of rarity

Worn (The most common and lowest)
Standard (you are getting somewhere)
Specialized ( you have some decent weapons now)
Superior (now you are really getting into it)
High-End (the stuff you would run with in the dark zone)
Classified (Armor pieces for dedicated certain builds)
Exotic (guns with certain minor abilities and unique designs)

The only true gamechanging ones being Classified and Exotic (hell maybe not even exotic lol) which keeps the game simple and enjoyable as you don't have to read damn paragraphs to understand what is better than the other.

Well Division 2 Community i hear you. You guys got the same set-up in the division two but i am being quite frankly. You guys put way too much info into just a simple vest at times.

Division is like ""here is a classified armor set that gives your shield ability a huge increase in survivability aswell as giving yourself and your teammates high resistance. We call it the D3-FNC""

Division 2 is like "" here is a high end. It has various crazy talents and perks already which you can grind for a few hours to min-max out for something you will eventually remove for something else to rinse and repeat. Yeah sure your storage will be clustered up but you wanna keep them dont you?""

GAMEPLAY

It's pretty much the same aside the fact that body armor is now your new major health and not just basic health. So Your Armor is the only stat to influence your survivability and not your stamina from divison one that was influencing your healing amount, health, and other things while armor was just a flat-out % resistance buff.

there is not much else to say really lol. (atleast from my point of view)

OVERVIEW

I recommend people to still buy the division during a sale as it's story feels a lot more better with the amosphere and scenario you are thrown into. No crazy cyber-hyper tech guy trying to take over DC. Just a Bio-Weapon wiping out Manahttan and NYC. Gameplay feels alright even with the copy and paste encounters and it's a game you can just play shutting your brain off.

This game is exactly the matching description of the iceberg theory. It has a floating surface which is something everybody can enjoy and the ""body"" hidden under water. You all know everything about builds, bugs etc... so let's move forward. 

PROS:
- unique gameplay and nice ambience. 

CONS:
- there is no control from ubisoft over those who cheat
- there's not a customer service where you can report such people.
- the only valuable content is the content with massive problems (DZ)
- there is no balancing in builds leading to monotonous gameplay.
- there are not any tiers related to skills: farmers stand no chance (even if they are 8v1) against a pro player.
- the game survives on the camel's back of nostalgia and players that are ""competitive"" (can we really call it competitive if there are not any competitions at all?)
- few servers and fewer people
- toxic behaviour (you can write literally whatever comes to your mind) and still no consequences. 
- useless items/builds
- some activities are just unplayable if you haven't got any friends to play with (don't rely on mm).

These are just ""some"" of the things which makes this game a shame and a nono. They may sound minor issues (not really) but this is the only game I've ever played that has MORE CHEATERS THAN LEGIT PLAYERS. That's FACTS and It's not debatable. So if you are thinking about getting this game (if ever) just don't bc it's a waste of money and time whichever the price will turn out to be.

The atmosphere is great, and the endgame activities like Survival and Underground are great too. The Dark Zone is also an excellent time waster. Just as a tip though, don't do the world tier 5 incursions on challenging if you don't have at least one other person with you. 
Oh, and don't touch PvP. 

Overall, 8/10 game, get gold edition when it goes on sale.

(Edit after here)

Well, it's been a while since I touched this game. I came back recently to play with a friend and I'd like to say that... its still really good upon a second look! I figured out some AI quirks that make things easier (like how they don't know where you are if they didn't see you leave cover), and the multiplayer progression system is practically seamless! A minor criticism is that it's sort of hard to friend people through Ubisoft, but that isn't a problem with the game.

On a second look, 9/10 game, still a little overpriced for its age, but really great with friends!

""Tom Clancy's The Division,"" developed by Massive Entertainment and published by Ubisoft, is a third-person shooter that thrusts players into a chaotic, virus-ravaged New York City. With its gripping storyline, tactical combat, and expansive open world, this game offers a compelling blend of action and strategy.

Gripping Post-Pandemic Narrative (4/5):
The game's premise revolves around a devastating smallpox pandemic that has plunged New York City into chaos. As an elite sleeper agent of The Division, your mission is to restore order, investigate the source of the virus, and confront hostile factions. The narrative is engaging, with well-executed lore and a sense of urgency that keeps players invested in the unfolding story.

Expansive Open World (4/5):
New York City in ""The Division"" is a sprawling, open-world playground. The level of detail in recreating the city is impressive, from iconic landmarks to eerily deserted streets. The dynamic day-night cycle and changing weather add depth to the atmosphere. The open world encourages exploration and offers a wealth of side missions and activities.

Tactical Combat (4/5):
Tactical combat is at the core of ""The Division."" Firefights require strategy, cover usage, and teamwork, especially in the game's challenging PvE and PvP modes. The variety of weapons, skills, and gear available allows for diverse playstyles, making encounters both intense and rewarding.

Dynamic Loot System (4/5):
The game features a loot system that keeps players engaged and constantly searching for better gear. Finding and customizing weapons and equipment is addictive, and the game continually offers opportunities to upgrade and fine-tune your character's abilities.

Multiplayer and Co-op (4/5):
""The Division"" provides a robust multiplayer experience. Players can team up with friends or join random squads to tackle missions, challenges, and the Dark Zone—a tense, PvPvE area where high-value loot is at stake. Coordinating with teammates is essential, and the multiplayer component adds depth to the game's replayability.

Technical Performance and Polish (3/5):
While ""The Division"" excels in many areas, it has faced some technical issues and bugs, particularly at its launch. However, Ubisoft has continued to support and improve the game through patches and updates, which have addressed many of the early problems.

Conclusion:
""Tom Clancy's The Division"" offers an engaging and chaotic post-pandemic experience, combining a gripping narrative, tactical combat, and a vast open world. It's a game that rewards teamwork, strategy, and exploration. While it had some initial technical hiccups, ongoing support from the developers has improved the overall experience.

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

Review:

🏙️ In the heart of a crisis-stricken New York City, The Division emerges as a gritty and immersive third-person shooter that thrusts players into the chaos of a society on the brink of collapse. 🏙️

🌆 The setting is the game's shining star: a meticulously detailed, virus-ridden Manhattan where familiar landmarks now stand as haunting reminders of a world turned upside down. The graphics paint a desolate yet captivating environment, from snow-covered streets to abandoned offices. The game captures the tension and unease of an urban battlefield with remarkable accuracy. 🌨️

🔫 Combat is a blend of tactical gunplay and RPG elements that gives weight to every bullet fired. The cover-based system keeps you engaged in intense firefights, requiring you to strategize and adapt to enemy movements. The cooperative gameplay, whether with AI-controlled teammates or fellow agents, elevates the experience as you work together to outwit enemies and complete objectives. 💥

🗺️ The open-world design offers a sense of freedom as you navigate through both the main missions and dynamic encounters that pepper the landscape. Exploration yields valuable resources, and the dark zones—a lawless no man's land—add a unique twist by encouraging a blend of cooperation and treachery.

💼 The loot and gear system introduces a sense of progression and customization. Equipping gear that suits your preferred playstyle becomes a satisfying endeavor, and the wide range of weapons and equipment options ensures diversity in tactics.

🚫 While the setting is rich, the narrative might not fully live up to its potential, often feeling like a backdrop rather than a driving force. Some mission design can become repetitive, and the endgame content might leave some players wanting more variety.

💻 Technical issues, especially at launch, did hinder the overall experience for many players. However, Ubisoft's commitment to updates and patches gradually improved the game's stability and performance.

In conclusion, The Division offers a gritty and atmospheric experience that immerses you in a crisis-ridden urban jungle. While it might have its flaws and a narrative that falls short in places, the game's world-building, tactical gameplay, and cooperative elements make it a memorable journey through a pandemic-ravaged New York City. As you gear up, fight to restore order, and navigate the challenges of the urban battlefield, the promise of camaraderie and thrilling gunplay awaits around every corner. 🏙️",1457673867,1693240125,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1.5/5 - Bullet sponge boringness, id rather play something with more  character and interesting gimmicks  like borderlands but I do not like looter shooters in general,",1693065197,1693065197,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Never played it when it came out because there were far more exciting games to play but recently I’ve been appreciating doing something mindless to unwind so I gave it a try.

The Division, it seems, are a bunch of government sleeper agents embedded in New York ready to shoot the locals if they misbehave. Someone’s created a particularly virile strain of Smallpox and infected the population with it, causing chaos in the city and leading to the government to quarantine the entire area. The locals who survived have gone a bit feral and you’ve been activated to whack their noses with a rolled up newspaper.

I’m really not sure I’m on board with the premise of this game. The only reason you would put sleeper agents into your own population is to silence people who don’t agree with you and instil fear in the others making them all fall in line. It’s got a bit of an air of fascism about it. We appear to be playing an SS officer in a post-apocalyptic New York.

First thing I noticed is the user interface clutter is everywhere and it’s difficult to make out what’s going on. It’s ridiculous. The world is actually quite pretty but it’s hard for me to appreciate it because there’s floating text boxes and numbers all over my screen. I’d expect something like this from an MMO where the numbers are arguably more important than whatever’s going on in game but for a third-person shooter, you need to be able to spot the enemy far off in the distance or creeping up from the side without all these distracting interface elements clouding vision. You can turn these off in the options but perhaps it should have been a choice to turn it on.

You’re part of the second wave of sleeper agents being flown into New York to secure the city and work out what happened to the first wave, but first there’s a bit of a bandit problem in Boston to sort out. There is a brief moment where you see a looter execute an innocent but after that it’s just “you should shoot all these guys because we say they’re bad”. I see no characterisation here. Like, why what seems like half of New York decided that looting and murdering everything in sight is the best response to being locked in the quarantine zone with little law enforcement baffles me. There are plenty of unfazed civilians just hanging about on the streets so presumably there are supplies being sent into the city. Their actions strike me as the actions of an organised crime syndicate taking advantage of the situation but it’s never suggested that they’re working together. I find it hard to believe that half of New York simultaneously decided that they were better off taking matters into their own hands.

The rest of the game is based around doing missions for the three wings of your operations base: security who are trying to regain control of the city; medical who are searching for a cure and tech who are restoring the city’s essential utilities to working order. You can build new facilities for each, unlocking new skills and abilities which aid combat ranging from kinda neat to complete waste of time.

It’s a cover-based shooter and I generally find those a bit frustrating. Running about and shooting things is how I like to play but in this it’s a great way to be riddled with holes so plunking yourself in front of a wall is the only way to survive the more spongey enemies, and it’s extremely unforgiving in this aspect. Then I shoot out with my incredibly inaccurate gun with an infuriatingly long reload time and hit the lovingly detailed environment around whatever psycho I’m trying to kill. And I’m sure there’s some objects that the AI can shoot through but might as well be Kevlar when I try to return fire.

Each district has a recommended level and a safe house that acts as a regional hub, each run by a quest-giver with a maximum of one quirky trait that they will crowbar into every dialogue line. They’re supposed to be funny, I guess, but every time I finished a side quest to grind my level up for the next mission I would wonder if the looters are looking for an extra member. It’s supposed to lend the game some comic relief but the game is so grindingly gritty in both tone and gameplay that it comes across as desperate and annoying.

It’s a sandbox world that’s got a remarkable level of detail but it doesn’t feel very alive. There’s the occasional unreactive civilian blissfully wandering about a warzone and the groups of street thugs but most of the time is spent sprinting down boring straight roads to get to the next load of people to shoot. It could have done with some faster method of getting around. Maybe not a car as the clutter on the road would make reaching any sort of speed impossible but a motorbike would have worked well. Hell, I’d have taken a fucking moped.

That MMO comment earlier maybe more justified than first thought. The game itself identifies as a co-op shooter but everything’s quantified. Enemies have visible levels and health bars, randomly spawning side activities scatter the world and there’re other players milling about safe houses you can group up with. It’s like Destiny with even less of a soul. Gear you pick up have three stats which increase your overall damage, health and ability strength, the idea being you can equip different kinds of items depending on how you want to build your character.

The entire base of operations world hub is even more cluttered than the world and it’s quite hard to work out which NPCs are for what, or where they are. I eventually stumbled into the loot box room, which figures for an MMO. They offer cosmetics but they’re all variations of winter, hunting and hiking gear. Running about murdering civilians in a large purple hat might have been fun but this game is far too boring for that. You can collect key fragments from dead elite enemies, ten of which are required to have a go on the slot machine, or you can just buy them but, like I’ve said, it’s not worth it.

I wouldn’t say I enjoyed the game. It passed the time and scratched an itch but there are better games that would have achieved the same thing and that wouldn’t have made me feel like a Nazi in an insane asylum, and once that itch had been scratched, it was too vacuous an experience to muddle through.",1692571701,1692571701,False,1,1,0.492307692766189575,0,True,False,False

DLCs:
- Underground: Interesting, but average, like another type of activity, but in the city's underground (metro). Randomly generated missions proolong interest for some time.
- Survival: THIS is what Division had to look like, absolutely cool mode with a feel of real snowy cold winter pandemic apocalypse setting.
- Last Stand: Some kind of deathmatch, haven't even played it.

Downsides for me are:
- Looter-shooter genre.
- Need to have a connection (I really hope Ubisoft will make it playable offline when servers will be taken down).
- Cheaters in Dark Zone.
- Sequel ruined the story and franchise completely with it's updates.

You can like it, you can hate it.
I love this game. But with shrinking player base it can be hard to level up your character and enjoy some activities, sometimes you will need to find people on forums/discord servers to play with.

I wouldn't buy it unless it's on sale, but if you can get it for under $20, 100% worth it.",1692052537,1692052537,True,1,0,0.521276593208312988,0,True,False,False

I played The Division 2 first, and that game feels smoother in some ways, but The Division 1 feels inspired in a way D2 doesn't. The world of D1 is alive: you help citizens who approach you and often thank you with items, they lean out windows to react to your fights, you can explore apartments throughout New York and actually find clothes in dressers rather than random boxes in back alleys. With the outbreak more present it feels like there's urgency to what's going on. Even upgrading your New York base of operations feels more obviously important and interesting than the White House in DC. I never felt like going back to the White House, it was disconnected from me and I didn't see how what I did in game affected it. In D1, that route is made clear, and the NPCs you bring to the base have personalities. Even the dogs in D1 have more personality, and interact with each other and you in different ways, instead of always running away.

They're both fun, but in D2 I felt like I'd arrived too late and was mopping up someone else's mess with half the story already told. D1 feels like the game that was intended to be made.",1692033363,1692033363,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great story line. but having never played it pre ""pandemic"" it is very very crazy how many similarities there are in the in game rhetoric as compared to real life.

finished the game in about 30 hours. went around getting every little collectable just for it to be bugged anyway....

Don't hesitate to get this game. It's fantastic and so underrated. 

After purchasing the second one for about £3.50 (because it kept crashing) I could see the potential and thoroughly enjoyed what I could play of it despite the crashing. Then when the first came on offer for £3.89 and didn't have the crashing problem I got it, and trust me, at that price it's an absolute bargain. 

I agree with a lot of other reviewers: the first one is better than the second. It's very tactical, the story's amazing, I love the realism unlike any other survival game you'll play, the arsenal's phenomenal and boy is it fun. When it seems a bit samey, it's time to do another mission, and play out the rest of the story of the game. But don't settle for going solo all the time. I always play single player myself but when this game paired me up with the matchmaking missions, that is when I had the most fun. Do a bit of matchmaking Co-op play now and then even if you prefer lone wolf because it's great and you won't regret it. 

Surprisingly, I have added this to my list of favourite PC games of all time! It's not in the Best of the Best folder, but it's in the Best! I would even go as far as to rate this higher than a lot of the Far Cry games. Yeah, definitely. It deserves 88%, not 70% Eh?  It doesn't quite get 90% because it will still crash when you try to select Fullscreen in video options. But this is resolved by selecting Windowed Fullscreen, which is actually Fullscreen so you don't need to worry. Weird. And the fact that very occasionally guys will spawn out of thin air because the game doesn't realise you already killed them earlier and have just returned. It's nothing major. I wouldn't downgrade it much just for that so I'm giving it 88%, no less than 85%. Yeah, definitely get this game. It's epic, with a fun rating of 10/10 especially when matchmaking.",1691626687,1691629553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In other words, whatever my friends were playing 5 years ago is what I'm playing today. So it goes with The Division. I stumbled across this game the other day and I can't even rightly recall what intrigued me about it but I nonetheless pulled the trigger and bought the base game/DLC bundle on deep discount. At the time of writing this review I'm over 64-hours into the game. I've ""100%-ed"" the base game, I've been working my way up the ranks in both the Dark Zone and the Underground, and am loving every single minute of it. This game (especially in a post-COVID world) has struck a very fine and resounding chord with me. The dark and visceral atmosphere; the widespread hopelessness and desperation; the brutal battle between the enforcers of law and order and those who seek to dismantle the entire system and burn it down. It's all incredibly immersive, and we haven't even touched upon the gameplay itself. Your agent movement is excellent; the gunplay is really fun; the cover & move tactics are intuitive and fluid; the loot system feels very balanced; and all of the different game modes are just icing on top of an already delicious cake. This game is easily a Top 5 for me now, and though I've yet to play The Division 2 I am at least glad the series is enjoying a new sense of vitality with the advent of The Division Heartland and, to a lesser extent, The Division Resurgence on the mobile platform.

From the moment I started playing, it became apparent that this game was riddled with issues that hindered any potential for enjoyable gameplay.

First and foremost, the storyline in The Division is utterly forgettable and cliché-ridden. A generic virus outbreak scenario in a post-apocalyptic setting is nothing new, and the game does little to add any originality or depth to the narrative. The lackluster storytelling made it hard for me to connect with the characters or care about the world I was meant to save.

The gameplay mechanics were equally as frustrating as the storyline. The combat system felt clunky and unpolished, making gunfights more of a chore than an enjoyable challenge. The AI of both enemies and allies was laughably inept, with enemies often behaving in absurdly predictable patterns, while friendly NPCs regularly got stuck in objects or ignored the player's commands altogether.

Furthermore, the game suffered from a severe lack of content. The open-world map was vast, but it was mostly filled with copy-paste buildings and repetitive side missions that quickly became a tedious grind. The promise of a dynamic multiplayer experience was not fully realized, as the multiplayer modes felt half-baked and failed to deliver on the excitement of a shared online world.

To add insult to injury, the game was plagued with numerous bugs and technical glitches. Frame rate drops, connection issues, and crashes were all too common, turning what should have been an immersive experience into a frustrating exercise in patience.

Even the graphics and visual design, which were initially praised during the game's marketing, failed to live up to expectations. The environments lacked the level of detail and realism one would expect from a modern AAA title, and character models often looked awkward and lifeless.

Finally, the game's microtransactions and pay-to-win elements were an obvious cash grab, leaving a sour taste in the mouth of players who were expecting a fair and balanced gaming experience.

Overall, Tom Clancy's The Division fell far short of its promises and potential. Its lackluster storyline, clunky gameplay, technical issues, and exploitative monetization make it a regrettable addition to any gamer's collection. Save your time and money for a more polished and enjoyable gaming experience elsewhere.",1689862013,1689862013,False,2,1,0.498098880052566528,0,True,False,False

365590,141927776,76561199089868017,14,6,272,0,152,1693156660,"It's a third person cover-based shooter with an emphasis on loot acquisition and combat optimization. While there is player-vs-player gameplay, mostly it's player-vs-environment (AI).

While the shoot-and-loot gameplay is nothing special (Borderlands does it better) what really sets the game apart is the atmosphere and setting.

The plotline involves a devastating bioweapon attack on New York City that causes a collapse of law and order. You are a part of the titular ""Division"", a secretive government agency that is activated after all else has failed. You've certainly got your work cut out for you, as the city has been overrun by escaped convicts, looters, and a group of insane sanitation workers (""Cleaners"") that are determined to burn the virus out by killing all potential hosts.

And really, this is the best post-apocalyptic depiction of NYC, or any city for that matter, that I've ever seen. You've got ransacked police stations, looters in the streets, civilians scavenging for food, an impressive dichotomy of normal city life juxtaposed with signs of societal collapse...

Graphically the game is stunning. The Snowdrop game engine has some excellent weather effects. I never thought I would say that snow in a video game could be beautiful, but in The Division it is! There are furious blizzards, lighter snow flurries, high-resolution footprints in the snow, and even a light dusting of snow on your character's shoulders after they've been outside for awhile. But it's not just snow that looks good. Skyscrapers reflect light, glass shatters realistically when shot, the barrel of your machine gun will turn red and steam after prolonged fire, there's just so many little touches that make for a great presentation.

Unlike many Tom Clancy games, the Division does NOT have realistic combat. There is no ""one bullet kills"" type of realism, and no emphasis on bullet ballistics. Both the player and enemies have a large health pool. Most bosses can take a full magazine of bullets to the face and keep fighting as though nothing's the matter. While some people will complain about these ""bullet sponge"" enemies, I felt that overall combat in this game is fun. If you're looking for more realism in your Tom Clancy games, try Wildlands.

Combat mostly involves small arms firefights against groups of enemy infantry. While most of the enemies are just guys with assault rifles, a few of them will be specialists that present additional challenges. For example one specialist is a shotgunner that will deal major damage if allowed to get up close. Another specialist is a guy who hides behind a shield which protects him from your bullets, but he is vulnerable to flanking attacks. Many of these bad guy specialists have weak points; hitting the weak point will stun/damage the enemy.

The cover-based shooting makes good use of a cover-to-cover movement mechanic. There is also a blind fire attack mechanic which gives reduced accuracy but leaves you less vulnerable to return fire.

A big part of the game is unlocking skills. As you progress through the storyline you earn Medical, Security, and Technical skill points which can be spent to upgrade your base of operations. An upgraded base of operations gives you permanent buffs as well as more options for combat optimization. Extra shopkeepers can be unlocked, free loot can be gotten, and most importantly you can invest in your character's skill trees. You can have up to three skills available at a time, and which ones you choose will have a huge impact on how you play. For example, one skill is a ""seeker grenade"" that, once thrown will actively hunt down the enemy and explode. Another skill is a ""support station"" that provides constant healing as long as you remain within the area of effect. Skills can be easily switched out; there is no such thing as messing up your character build and having to re-spec your character.

Your base of operations starts out as a dilapidated post office, but as you gradually build it up it eventually becomes a high tech base teeming with trained personnel. Awesome!

This game has been described as an ""RPG"" but the storyline is linear with no plot choices to make. The character development of your NPC quest-givers also leaves much to be desired. Your Division boss (Lau) and the Medical supervisor (Kandal) were I guess supposed to be written as assertive leader-types, but instead they just came across as being arrogant jerks. The other two main NPCs in your base (Benitez, Rhodes) have better dialogue but are still mostly forgettable. The game's main antagonist (Keener) is poorly fleshed out and absent for most of the game. It is never adequately explained why Keener's lackeys (the LMB) are actually fighting you. On the plus side, there is a large amount of backstory flavor in the form of audio diaries (cell phones), written situation reports, survival guides, ect.

As your character completes missions they earn experience points which lead to level ups with better stats. Each mission you take on will have a recommended level, and I strongly advise that you respect it! Completing a level 20 mission when you are only level 19 is going to be tough. Completing that same mission at level 18 may be outright impossible. But overall for most of the game experience points are plentiful, side quests give good rewards, and there's little incentive to go grinding for XP.

Once you've made it to the maximum level (30) and beaten all the main missions you'd probably think the game is over, right? Wrong! The Division is actually only just starting because a slew of end-game content gets unlocked at that point! Completing the main campaign (with side quests) will probably take about 20 hours, but the end-game content can easily occupy you for HUNDREDS of hours of fun!

In the end game, since there are no more experience levels, you instead will be looking for classified gear sets and exotic items. These are rare loot drops, and indeed your character progression will slow down considerably. I do feel Borderlands handled late-game character progression better, because you could still level up and put points into your large skill tree, while in the Division by level 30 you've already maxed out your skill trees and levels -- better loot is all there is left to optimize your character with.

A brief synopsis of end-game content:

*High value targets, which are basically randomized open world quests of variable difficulty.
*West Side Piers, a new area that opens up with its own quests.
*Underground (paid DLC), a randomized quest line with its own level-up system and unique combat modifiers.
*Survival (paid DLC), you're stripped of all gear and must survive both the weather and your enemies.
*Last Stand (paid DLC), team-based PvP games.
*Daily and Weekly Challenges, replay the main missions under specific conditions for extra rewards.
*Incursions, the hardest PvE missions in the game, they must be completed with a group.
*Resistance, survive as long as possible against progressively harder waves of bad guys.
*Dark Zone, the main PvP area in the game, you can be killed by other players (rogues) but there is also PvE content. You can actually enter the DZ before level 30 but it's probably better to wait until the end game.

The Division also contains a crafting system, a weapon recalibration system, and unlockable cosmetics and emotes. There's a bewildering variety of currencies, probably more than any other game I've played (it should've been simplified).

The game music is high quality and helps to set the mood. Fighting criminal gangs in a neon-lit Times Square as a blizzard rages and the ""Times Square"" soundtrack plays is an incredible experience!

The Division can be played solo, but I strongly recommend playing it with friends. Up to 4 players can join up together for some great co-op fun!

If you're looking for a shoot-and-loot game with great atmosphere and fun co-op, try out The Division!",1689190670,1689190670,False,9,2,0.5328025221824646,1,True,True,False

{{ Disregard Time Played! I have have this game on Ubi Connect for ages and have Gold Edition and played the heck out of it! Only got it here to connect my game to Steam! }} 

I love this Game and its Mechanics. I think the Duck and Cover mechanic is hands down done so good in the Division games. The game has good story and good gun play with a fair amount of customization for you and your weapons and skills. I love the openness of this game, how big it is in scope of the New York backdrop. The graphics are real good as well. 

I love how they even added hit areas on the mobs that if you shoot it, it will have an effect on them as in hitting a ammo bag or a med pouch will cause them to freak out or take damage and even explode ! Also you can use the environment as well as in hitting gas cans or tanks to help attack your enemies by lighting them on fire or dousing them in chemicals to make them freak out and then take them down. 

I also love the RPG aspects of the game as well. You can lvl up your gear and weapons and your character via skills and perks. Weapons can also be modded to give you extra stats and fire power. 

I know this game has been out for a good while now but it's still a very good game to play today Solo or with Friends! I mostly play Solo and still enjoy the heck out of it. I also have no issues with missions on Solo play. 

So if you like a bit of a Tactical RPG in 3rd person, I say add this one to your cart! More so if you have never played a Division game!

Undeniably, the highlight here is the gorgeous city of New York represented in full detail and offering so many places to explore. Also on the positive side the battles have great pace and require clever tactics, the coop experience is well implemented and there is a vast selection of equipment, weapons, skills and customization. On the other hand the developers are stuck to the logic ""quantity over quality"". The main story is shallow, the missions are repetitive and unrewarding and the game lacks purpose. You will spend most of your time on the menus rearranging equipment or mechanically traveling from one spot of the map to another killing thugs without exactly knowing why or just pursuing more loot. It is a decent game when experienced in co-op but don't expect anything groundbreaking and certainly don't play it alone.


Manometer: 6/10[/b]
 

The good
- Awesome visuals. High quality graphics with detailed models and realistic dirty, warn out textures. Atmospheric lighting with good day/night system and a bunch of great optical effects like fog, flares and volume lights. Weather system is also nice with convincing snowfall and storms.
- Fantastically designed world. Its New York is one of the most impressive and detailed cities you can find in any game out there. Each neighborhood has its own identity and unique characteristics visually. Except of the ground zero roads the city has multiple layers to move on, from terraces to sewers and there are many gorgeous interiors to explore. Most of them are designed with real care and attention to detail. They have even replicated existing New York's landmarks.
- Except of one or two things the gameplay mechanics are smooth and well implemented. Characters' movement, changing direction and climbing are fluid enough. More complex actions like reloading, changing weapons or deploying skills are also very responsive.
- Well implemented battles with great pace. Although they are not as fast as other shooters you can feel the tension and survival agony. Multiple battle events (from explosions to snipping) and elements (from turrets to supporting stations) happening simultaneously offer a strong experience.
- It is deep enough. It offers a huge amount of weapons, updates, modifications, skills, clothes, abilities and lot more that give you the opportunity not only to upgrade your character gradually but also personalize her/him according to your taste.
- Seamless coop experience. Easy paring and team creation. Some of the difficult missions require strategy and good communication between the team members in order to beat them, which gives the coop mode an extra plus.
- Although there is a small variation of enemies they are well designed and convincing as thugs or gang members.
- Decent enemies' AI. They have a wide repertoire of movements and they use them cleverly. Depending on the battle's state they will follow different tactics deciding each time if it's appropriate to shoot, run towards you or take cover. Yet, there are some moments that they seem to not give a single fuck.
- Animations are realistic and smooth and they overall feel convincing enough (except when it comes on taking damage or express pain).
- Well built menus. Although the developers had to deal with a ton of information, skills and weapons they managed to arrange them pretty well inside a very functional menus' structure. You will need some time to get used of them though.
- Great sound design. Environmental sounds feel realistic, voice acting performances are decent and battles' sounds are satisfying.
- There are some parts with awesome rock music that enhances the atmosphere and manages to give you some strong survival/battle vibes.
-  Although the core story is weak and barely exists there are many points of interest scattered inside the world. Recorded messages, distress calls, visions, memories and hidden easter eggs will give you a fairly good idea of the city before and during the pandemic and will encourage you explore more.
- There are regions that offer a PvP option against other teams, although due to its age the online part of the game is pretty dead.
- All these similarities with the Covid pandemic are impressive and kind of creepy.
- It can offer a lot of hours of playtime and it is cheap when it goes on sales.

The bad
- The main story is shallow and unfortunately all these clues you collect from echoes or recordings seem to be too fragmented and unimportant. They don't really contribute each other in order to form a bigger story. Moreover the game's own structure manages to convince you that there are more important things to bother than the lore. It is supposed that you try to retrieve the city from some bad guys, but it does not give you the reason to do so. You will end up travelling from one spot on the map to another and just shoot guys in an endless pursuit of xp and cash without even having time to stop for a while to hear your radio or watch an echo beacon. And it is not the players' fault, but a designers' choice to hook you on looting.
- I would like a bigger variation of enemies and some more missions' scenarios. You experience them all during the first dozens of hours and after that they are almost the same again and again. The only thing that changes is the place. Side missions could be more rewarding too. They end up giving you just xp or some weapon or a silly index instead of a real conversation with an NPC or a cut scene video or an important event. Ubisoft just wants to fill the map with content without wandering whether it deserves your time or is repetitive.
- This dynamic leveling up system seems once more to be in vain. As you gain more money the weapons you can buy get more expensive. As you gain more firepower the enemies you face get stronger. Yeah, you can always have some easy kills facing a level 10 gang when you are at level 30. But the actual battle experience against enemies of the same level as yours never changes. Similarly the overall game difficulty on acquiring better equipment never really changes.
- You have to spend tons of hours on your inventory rearranging things and cleaning up a never ending mess from the continuous looting. Most of the gear you gather are expendable. Before realizing how awesome your new weapon is you have already found a new, even stronger one. Nothing has real value and you can never attach emotionally to your equipment (if such a thing exists).
- Weak atmosphere that feels a bit generic. The city is too crowded and active for a pandemic/quarantine situation. You literally cannot find a city block without its local gang, wandering couple or beggar. It should be more dark and lonely out there. It's a pity for the fantastic 3d model and the great lighting/weather effects.
- Gameplay mechanics are good but without  jump and crouch commands sometimes your character feels heavy and restricted. Also a lot of times the cover action can be sticky or irresponsive with a result of some annoying deaths.
- Enemies often don't react to the bullets they receive, while some pain or death animations are unconvincing. There is no blood too. Let's say that satisfaction through kills is not game's strongest asset.
- The city could be more destructible. Only few selected things get affected or destroyed during the battles. This also affects the feeling of satisfaction during the battle.
- Some minor bugs here and there. Some menus tend to glitch or give false information. Few disconnects and desktop crashes. Bad optimization at some critical points like battle respawning. After a death you will often respawn in the middle of the pit with a result of instantaneously dying again. Annoying.",1644928106,1687659950,True,9,2,0.606549084186553955,0,True,False,False

The game looks great, I was drawn to this one as I love the snowy new York setting. It a really cool place to be in. You can run it on medium-ish settings but the game will crash randomly. I ran it on low settings which did improve with the crashing (less frequent). 

As people have said uplay will not work on deck, and after following all the work arounds which didn't work, I installed Ubisoft connect and it worked right away. I ran it on proton 7 though so you may need to do the same to be able to play the game.

However my god, the game crashing after every hour randomly just got too annoying and the final straw for me was when Ubisoft connect uninstalled itself after one of the 268 crashes I've had this morning. I don't know if this was a deck issue only or just a part of the game but there was this weird delay between shooting an enemy and then dying. I would shoot them, their health bar is empty then maybe half a second later they would die. No frame drop or anything just a weird delay.

This game holds a much more sinister and realistic tone to it, focusing the story on more being about the People in New York who fell to Corbin-98, The Dollar Flu I mean.

The map for this game is 1000x better than Division 2's due to it feeling more alive with the citizens roaming around. In a two hour game session for this that I have done recently, I have watched 4 citizens die due to starvation and fall infront of me. I have rescued countless JTF soldiers, quelled apocalyptic gangs and restored some functionality to the Post office. (Still in the process of fixing everything up on my new run through the game)

Division 2 however, is much more of your Hollywood style Apocalypse scenario, less focused on the people and more focused on Agents and Dissent amongst them. In Division 2, you are working through the capital of the US and while its a cool area, they neutered the New York that you know from Division 1.

Division 1 has been a constant for me, because while I hate the combat system being cover-to-cover and catering heavily to consoles and controllers ( I use M&KB and play on PC clearly), it still feels like I have at least a decent bit of control over my character's movement. I've heard about them  making a New Division game named Heartland which is supposedly going to play a lot like Tarkov and all those games, and I will not be joining in on those.  The reasoning is simple, I don't like those style of games, but for those of you looking into getting a Co-op(potentially..

- Character customization is very limited. Not that I expected a huge list of faces and hairstyles, but GR:W has a lot better customization.

- Weapon tiers. You will get the same weapon many times, but with better stats. I hate this kind of system in non-MMO games. Level up character, find/buy same weapon but with higher tier and better stats.

- Consumables. Hardly useful system. This game is not about survival.

- Arcade damage system. You need to use many bullets before your enemy will die. There is a system similar to weapon tiers. Same NPC, but stronger. More bullets to waste.

- Difficulty. As a solo player, I have to say that some missions had too strong enemies for one player, Maybe because I had weak weapons (doubt it). Few players sometimes spawned, but some of them were not very careful and made fatal mistakes.

I don't know what else to say. MMORPG-Action. Installed GR: Wildlands shortly after my last launch and it's a lot better game.

Side note: Ubisoft has a serious tendency of making almost identical games. AC/FC had towers and crafting using animal ingredients. When they changed AC with AC: Origins, they added a different/more deep crafting system, weapon levels and looting. Looting and weapon level system appeared in The Division. I don't know about FC5 and GR:B. I heard that Ghost Recon: Breakpoint adopted few things from Division, and many players don't like it. Will latest Watch Dogs use something from Ghost Recon?

Mechanics are great, shooting and skills feel punchy and satisfying, although enemies can be spongie at times. Progression is good, without feeling too grindy, except of course when you make it to the end game (but this goes for ANY looter-shooter when you're trying to min-max)

The atmosphere of this game is so much better than TD2. Winter New York suits the material of the game so much better than summer Washington D.C. Really makes the dark tone of the game more easily achievable. 

World building is mainly through intel pickups and short videos that you can find and get rewarded with as you play through the story.

Probably the most complete feeling looter-shooter of its time, and definitely worth the price of admission in 2023.",1684879147,1684879147,True,3,0,0.532457470893859863,0,True,False,False

I wish more people still played so I could just run around the open world with friends, but for solo play it has been really engaging so it's not a huge complaint.

When I was a kid I got a brand new Xbox One, in the package this game was included via activation code. I played the game and didn't get very far and one day I lost the account with the actual game itself. This year I remembered that this game exists and bought a physical copy so I could play and finish it. I wasn't playing it regularly though I made it pretty far when my Xbox One ( yes the same one I was gifted a while ago ) finally broke ( problem with the battery brick, easy replacement though I couldn't find anyone selling the damn thing ). Out of desperation and sheer determination to beat the game I bought it on Steam while on sale. Having been exhausted from playing this game almost the third time, I still managed to push on.

The review starts here - I recommend picking this game up at a a sale, also during the winter due to the immersion. I'm not going to spoil the story even though this game is pretty old, but I'd say it is solid and kept my attention through the whole playthrough. 

This game is a looter-shooter, you are greatly encouraged to explore and by doing that you can find some amazing loot including weapons, modifications, gear and cosmetics for your Division Agent.

What I really like about this game is the gunplay. The game is played like a cover-shooter. Essentially, you are going to get killed EXTREMELY quickly if you are in the open ( duh ), so finding cover is essential to your survival. When in cover you can blind-fire or peek-fire also you can move around or vault the cover that you are hiding behind. Pretty straight forward. 

The missions are exciting, the main missions act like dungeons. You'd start with one area and push through enemies and obstacles until you reach a boss that you need to defeat in order to complete the mission in order to earn your well deserved loot and XP.  The side missions are...well...repetitive to say the least. The side missions are separated into 4 types of side missions. The regular ones which give you XP, loot, blueprints and so on, the Medical Wing, the Security Wing and Tech Wing side missions which each give you, aside from the XP, points for its corresponding mission type in order to upgrade your Wings at the Base of Operations. 

Base of Operations acts as your main...well...base. There you can upgrade the Security, Medical and Tech wing each of which give you upgrades,perks, talents and new abilities that you can equip. This encourages a lot of mixing and matching in order to find your perfect and preferred playstyle. Like healing people and staying healthy yourself? Try the Medical abilities! How about becoming a tanky, unstoppable killing machine? The Security abilities are for you! Do you wish to be a mastermind of gadgets and other smart devices? The Tech abilities have got you covered.

There are PvP and PvE elements in this game. The PvP aspect is found in Dark Zones-they are very dangerous places which reward you greatly, there you can meet the toughest of enemies, rogue agents and even other people all of which fight in order to get the best of loot. I haven't played much of the Dark Zone but from what I've gathered it's pretty fun if you are interested in PvPvE.

This review vaguely and barely covers the actual content this game has to offer, it's best you see a professional review or take a look at some Youtubers playing the game in order to see if you like it. Overall I'd give this game a praise for being so immersive and atmospheric, trust me, even exploring this beautiful city, which is New York by the way just never gets boring. I strongly recommend getting it on sale, especially, as I've previously mentioned during the winter so you can grab yourself a cup of hot cocoa, wrap yourself in a blanket and enjoy the sullen and atmospheric ambiance of the, now, infection overtaken New York.",1682898292,1682898292,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many hours in now and no crashes at all!

For a game that has been out for over 6 years, the environment, graphics, and gameplay are excellent. Better than some recent £50+ games I have tried which have been created as though we are just beta testers for their game. 

Probably said many times before but nothing better than running through a detailed snowy New York and teaming up with random people to complete legendary missions etc

Only my opinion but feel story and overall experience is better and smoother than Division 2. Surprised how much of a player base this still has.

I was sorely wrong, Ubisoft can actually make epics games *pun intended* like the ""Division 1"" (2016). I imagine Mr. Tomas Clancy wrote a story about Seattle on a normal day but I think Ubisoft forced him to make it about New York during a dastardly pandemic (Covid Virus).  First off, the garphics in this game are almost as good as Call of Duty Advanced Warfare (GOAT cod Imo), Seattle is modeled very well and you almost feel like a homeless man will stab you at any moment, just like real life Seattle. Secondly, the factions are very interesting, they have the poor people faction, the italians, the faction based on a race of people that I cannot point out, and the call of duty faction. All the factions have ""unique"" ""gameplay"" ""features"" that add a fun challenge (dark souls) to the game. Another aspect of the game that is really neat (interesting) is the dark zone, in the dark zone you get the fight homeless people who collected social security and you also get to fight other players. You can take your enemies EBT cards and extract them to progress. Overall the game is very enjoyable and makes me have a good feeling.

I played it back in 2016 but never finished it. That way my entry was relatively fresh but biased by the strong impression of TD2.  TD2 makes very obvious, where the game has aged well and where not. But even with that comparison it is very much still worth playing. Since I may sound a little negative during the rest of the review, due to its comparitive nature. let's put it that way: if TD2 wouldn't feel better than TD1, sth. would be wrong with TD2, not with TD1. The comparision doesn't make TD1 a bad game. It provided strong roots for what TD2 became to be and it is worth getting back to it even after 8 years and the release of its successor.

Worldbuilding, graphics and Level design: I don't think that either TD1 or TD2 is better or worse. But the snow in New York gives TD1 a special touch, which is hard to compete with. The graphics are certainly not up to date. But I was surprised, by how well the game still looks. At this point It is aging, certainly, but holy moly: these are still very impressive graphics. I enjoyed the in-mission-levl-design in TD2 way more, though. Right after finishing the game I have trouble memorizing, more than two mission settings. There were just fewer moment, in which I was taking a break , because I liked the lvl so much, as I still do in TD2 after 120h playtime.

Game Systems and overall gameplay: while TD2 is a real rpg-LOOTER-shooter, TD1 is way more a rpg-shooter in which the looting aspect is tuned down quite a bit. The advantage being, that you don't have to open a box every five meters, but it leads to the problem that you very weak for a long time at the beginning. This gets resolved towatds the end, before you hit the lvl cap. But until then it can be frustrating at times. It became even more prevelant in the endgame:. The progression system changes with lvl 30 into a gear value system which is bound to a world tier system. The higher the gear value, the higher wiorld tier you can access up until tier 5. it took me less than an hour to get there, So for the moment I feel very much overpowered in comparison to the main campaign. In TD2 it took me 10 h.

Mission design: the mission design while more fleshed out in TD2 are very similar in both games. The side missions are a different story. though. There are ideas in TD1 I'd like to see more of in TD2. This concerns i.e. mace like puzzles under time pressure. While I the time pressure didn't make a lot of sense to me, I liked the missions themselves. The maze like aspecct is still very present in TD2, but not as a core element in a mission. Other missions were less favorable. But I liked the pool of experimentation I could feel within the game and in parts I wish they would have evolved them in other ways, than they did in TD2.

Moment to moment gameplay: the gameplay in TD1 feels more unpolished than in TD2. There is a certain stiffness to how it feels and a certain dryness to how it sounds. While not being bad, it felt unpolished to a degree, where it was not game breaking at all, but I was never able to shake it off, which certainly broke the immersion. I don't know how it would have been, if I hadn't played TD2 before. But since shooters evolved a lot since 2015, I guess I would have had the same feeling. This gets better in the end, when you can upgrade the weapons. But it remains to be a feeling I can't shake off.

The fights also came very much down to a gamble: there are always time slots in TD2 in which I know, I can deal damage without being damaged myself and there are ways to make that part of your strategy. In TD1 it was very much how much damage can I deal, before the enemy kills me and I have to have to get back in to cover, because we are always shooting at eachother at the same time. There seems to be no reaction to the damage I inflict and it made the fight for me more stale than in TD2.

End game and dlc policy. It is in the end game, where opinions are split within the TD community. The systems are a lot more fleshed ot in TD2 of course. TD2 has the same core. But defining your gear works different and the specializations are not present in TD1. TD1 has none the less a compelling and interesting gear system in the endgame. I may like TD2 more in that regard, but I don't think anything is missing in TD1. It is a very good system with a lot of variety to choose from. 

TD1 does however have more end game activities to choose from than TD2. All of them are fun and provide a variety of challenges. TD2 falls short in that comparison and it is one of the reason TD1 is still played in 2023. You may not find players in the main campaign, but you certainly find a solid enough player base in the end game. Some game modes are split, due to the dlc, but it is not as bad as in TD2, where players are split in two different progression and gear systems. Still bad practice, but not as bad as in TD2.

There is a lot more to say. But all the details I could mention. would only lead to one conclusion: having played TD2, it was obvious to me that the ideas in TD1 are very much the base for what TD2 became, and it is strong base. I prefer TD2 at this point. But TD1 is a game very much worth playing in 2023. It is very imppressive, how well it held up and I highly recommend it 8 years later. And even though it is not supported anymore, there is still a relieable player base to play the end game content with. I wouldn't pay full price. But it is on sale often enough and definetly worth going for.",1680482651,1680571577,True,14,0,0.65570145845413208,0,True,False,False

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic New York City, where players take on the role of a Division agent tasked with restoring order after a viral outbreak.

One of the best things about The Division is how seamlessly it allows players to play through the story missions with friends. The game offers a fantastic co-op experience, and it's easy to jump in and out of games with friends. The game is designed to be played with others, and it's a lot of fun to team up and take on the game's challenging missions together.

The gunplay in The Division is top-notch, and it's one of the game's standout features. The game offers a wide range of weapons, each with its own unique feel and handling. The game's cover-based mechanics also add to the tactical nature of the gameplay, making for a rewarding experience.

Graphically, The Division still looks fantastic in 2023. The game's attention to detail is remarkable, and it's clear that a lot of effort went into creating the game's immersive world. From the snowy streets of New York City to the dark and eerie underground tunnels, the game's environments are both beautiful and haunting.

PVP in The Division is also intense and rewarding. The game's Dark Zone offers a unique and challenging experience that is sure to keep players engaged for hours on end. The game offers a wide range of rewards for successfully extracting loot from the Dark Zone, making it an incredibly satisfying experience.

Overall, The Division is an amazing game that still holds up incredibly well in 2023. The game's co-op experience is fantastic, the gunplay is amazing, and the graphics are still impressive. The game's PVP is also intense and rewarding, making it a must-play for fans of the third-person shooter genre.",1481877997,1680018264,True,1,0,0.512040555477142334,0,True,False,False

There are too many copy/paste enemies, and too many bullet sponge enemies (especially the bosses.)  All the factions feel very similar, so the majority of combat encounters are very similar.

In my opinion, it's superior to The Division 2 in every single way. They dumbed down the PvP in Division 2 way too much, making it rely too heavily on what gear you're wearing rather than your skill. The only real knock against this game is the hackers/cheaters that you'll occasionally encounter, and you will encounter them in PvP because Ubisoft doesn't care about banning them, no matter how many times they are reported even with video evidence. Highly recommend also getting the Survival DLC. Game is also great for solo players as 99% of it can be played by yourself. It's a looter shooter, so be prepared to grind the same enemies, missions, etc over and over for loot. It plays well with a controller, but you will be at a disadvantage because a lot of the guns in this game have some considerable recoil, which is very difficult to control with a controller.

You can tell this game had an extremely passionate team designing the map. It's absolutely phenomenal. There is no corner of the map that seems bland or plain. It really feels like a world. If there was no dialogue in the game at all I would still understand what is happening perfectly, as the map is so well designed I don't NEED anything else. 

The gameplay may be lost in translation to some, as fps players (which make up the majority of the market these days) may have a hard time understanding the concept of shooting a guy in the head more than once without killing him, let alone hundreds of times. I totally agree, it seems strange, and I was once the guy who said something along the lines of ""why not just make them more heavily armored than have them be so bullet spongey?"" But now that we have the division 2, we see that the first one probably was the better of 2 evils. 

The game design outside of the immediate third person looter shooter experience is very well executed. The upgrading the base with materials gained from accomplishing encounters in the open world is pure genius, and it feels so good. It feels so rewarding to unlock different abilities with each upgrade, and it the changes to the base of operations gives us a visual representation of the change we are responsible for in the game world. 

Speaking of rewarding, the incursions may have fallen a bit short, as they became the only way to gain actual gear without having to deal with pvp, which at the game's peak was full of tryhard groups of 4 with the absolute most up to date meta gear you could hope to get. Playing solo against them, well let's just say nomad gearset bonuses weren't cutting it. 

But DLC came to the rescue, survival was the dlc of a lifetime, the grandaddy of all extraction shooters, it was perfect. Not a single bad thing to say about this experience, besides the fact that it was before its time, so people again failed to grasp the concept, which is sad now because it seems extraction shooters are all the rage with EFT, Hunt:showdown, cycle frontier, etc etc. being so popular. Makes me wonder why ubisoft won't re-release an anniversary edition of a standalone version of Survival.

I'm feeling especially nostalgic about this game as I'm having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that it's no longer popular, and hasn't been for years. The second game is an insult to this one.

One major issue is its lackluster story. Despite being set in a post-apocalyptic New York City, the game fails to create a compelling narrative that engages the player. The characters are forgettable, the dialogue is uninspired, and the overall plot is predictable.

Another major flaw is the game's repetitive gameplay. While the cover-based shooting is serviceable, the missions all feel the same after a while. The lack of variety in enemy types and objectives makes for a tedious experience that wears thin quickly.

Additionally, the game's online-focused nature can be frustrating. The always-online requirement and forced multiplayer elements can be a hindrance for those who prefer to play alone or without an internet connection. The game's matchmaking system is also hit-or-miss, leading to unbalanced matches and frustrating experiences.

Overall, the game is a disappointing title that fails to live up to its potential. While it has some good ideas and solid mechanics, its lackluster story, repetitive gameplay, and frustrating online elements make it a hard game to recommend.

First and foremost, the game requires a constant internet connection which introduces delay and weird hit reg due to internet shenanigans

LOOT:

Most items you get from enemies are incredibly weak, assuming you get anything. Most enemies either drop nothing or cosmetics/crafting supplies

Fighting bosses is no exception, with the mission completion rewarding usually being more substantial than any loot dropped from enemies during the mission. For most of the time I played, my weapons were either crafted or bought, as dropped weapons are just so terrible.

SHOOT:

Gunplay feels bad; weapons have no impact, enemies are bullet sponges, and cover controls are terrible, especially compared to other games (Splinter Cell Conviction, Gears of War, etc.). Due to the aforementioned loot problems, there is this jarring cycle of ""weak enemies"" --> ""overpowered enemies"" --> ""weak enemies"" as your loot becomes weak and is then replaced. This same effect occurs in other games (EX: Borderlands 2) but is not as jarring, with a good legendary being able to be used for multiple levels without ever being necessarily overpowered.

OTHER:
There are 3 mission types: Encounters (fight enemies and defend an objective), side missions (run around and interact with some objects while fighting some enemies), and main missions (fight through this building and shoot enemies). Main Missions are the only ones that are actually fun, but they're recommended levels are so spread apart that you have the grind unfun missions to even stand a chance. In addition, the game's narrative is incredibly weak despite an interesting premise, so you aren't particularly compelled to play through the missions to see the story through.

Should definitely pick up on sale if you havent. And if you already had it on ubisoft with the expansions, you don't have to rebuy any of them if its the same accounts thats connected to steam, just buy the regular standard version, and everything you already bought on ubisoft dlc and expansion wise will still be there.

Yet ALSO one of the biggest DISAPPOINTMENT after playing for 4,000+ hours.
I LOVE this game, and ALSO HATE it for the same time.
Let me explain.
This game is truly wonderful. The graphics, the story, the dialogues, the lighting, the atmosphere are gorgeous!!
The mission, the gears, the weapons are so good too.
Everything in this game is so good until I started to play seriously in the Dark Zone.
One of the reason I keep grinding and keep playing is that so I can improve my gears and weapons.
With better gears and weapons and right mods, I can improve my chance of winning against other players.
Yess Of course I also need skills.
Yet in the Dark Zone, I found out so many people are cheating. After thousands of hours of playing in the Darck Zone, I finally understand that there are many different types of cheaters. One with absurd one shot kills and teleporting, others with aimbot, others with RPM, and no recoil cheats, and anothers are so good in cheating subtly to stay under the radar. They are so good in using cheat and they pretend to be just like any normal players. Some are well mannered, most are total bullies. Those are the ones that cheated and stay so proud of it.
All of these are happening every day and so little things the developer can do. People say the game is dead, the developer does not put enough time here any longer. Yet I believe it is not because of their lack of time, but it is their ability limit to solve this cheating problem. So most people who play in the dark zone have mentalities ""no cheat no games""
To close my review:
This is a truly wonderful games, but also with so many cheaters destroying the Dark Zone.
DO NOT ever buy this game if you want to play against other players in the Dark Zone. Save some time and avoid huge heartaches.",1638351387,1677780994,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

June 25th 2020. A ton of micro intel to find in the way of people's phone's, laptops and signals etc. Then there's the story missions to complete. After that's all said and done if you you like risking getting annihilated you can step into the ""Dark Zone"" which is PvEvP (person vs environment vs other players) if another player or team of players go Rogue they can take you down while you're trying to have you precious loot ""Extracted"" to your Chest i.e your Storage. Because you can't just walk into the Dark zone and leave the Dark zone with items you have looted from chests / storages in game. You have to fight the NPC's and other player's potentially to extract it out of the area. A nice little addition. Seldom have I encountered another player that has gone rogue and if some one did on several occasions other players will hear the ""Extraction announcement"" I'm certain, if they are in the Dark zone and have come to help or at the very least see what the commotion ""Shooting / fire fights ) is all about.

Once you have hit level 30 you wont level any further but you will access more of the sleeper / sub content in the game that becomes available only to the player once they've hit Level 30. Then you attain a new level system. Your items you collect have a level system of their own as well Mods which give strengths, weaknesses, buffs etc you can make your weapon stronger through attachments which have mods as well as you armour (Gloves, vest, jacket, pants, holster) those also have slots to which you can also ad mods.

The environment is very immersive, some of the buildings you can explore for intel items or while on missions. Snow covered streets, fog and snow combination some times painful on the eyes. in saying that I usually fast travel to another area. Some of the NPC's throughout the city you can interact with and you gain a tiny bit of xp. Well i think I blabbed on enough.

i'm not a big fan of most rpgs, because i'm very picky when it comes to 'what do i spend my money on', and, especially with the launch of cyberpunk, i'm not a fan of broken-on-release games from dev teams with tight schedules. that being said, i also hate pay-to-win. i know, shocking to be asked of from rpgs.
the division is a pretty good game, bar pvp elements. i remember playing this with gamepass on console and it was an experience like no other: it wasn't call of duty in terms of being a shooter game; or call of duty in terms of paid guns; or call of duty in terms of... yeah you get the point, i played a lot of call of duty back in those days, and, hell, i used to be a god-tier sweat on a controller. but going from 'competitive first person shooter with children' to 'casual third person shooter with ai' was like transitioning from being a coal miner to a blacksmith. just felt like i could do waay more stuff and not get team killed for sucking, because i'm the only one on the team. :)
i'll tell you this for free though: [spoiler] sub-level 30 missions can be extremely difficult if you don't take the time to grind for gear before completing them. i say that as a person who nailed a level 28 mission at like level 26 or 27 because [/spoiler] i'm just too good.
other than that, thank fuck this doesn't have a battle royale mode. ish.

What started off as an overly ambitious 'next-gen' project for Ubisoft turned into a semi-disastrous launch and a game that seemed to peter out and die with many problems affecting players' enjoyment of a game with such amazing potential. And to Ubisoft's credit, they brought the game back from the brink and turned it into something resembling the masterpiece it was meant to be. I have played through this game into the endgame on two different platforms eight different times - I always maintain 4 endgame characters to maximise weeklies/loot in general. 

By version 1.8, The Division became a hidden gem that only the most dedicated fans recognised. A lot of people wrote the series off and never touched it again, but now if you talk to anyone about this game, the applicable phrase is ""if you know, you know"". The expansions and major updates offer incredible game modes like survival, legendary missions, incursions, PvP, wave mode, underground (procedurally generated sewer crawler with hidden surprises). 

The builds you can make with the gear and weapons in the game are so effective and rewarding to put together and use, and the game is perfectly designed for you to work on your main build and improve it using resources.

""This is a Ubisoft game. You need to register an Ubisoft account"" ... done (The only reason I have an account with Ubisoft at all and also the reason why I NEVER BUY anything on their store with a passion of 100 burning suns), now let's finally game  ... NO ""This is a Ubisoft game, you need to run the uPlay launcher"" (that's what it was called before they renamed it ""Connect""). So I closed Steam, started uPlay, logged into my Ubisoft account and now gaming at last .... NO ""you bought this game on Steam, you need to run Steam client"". Oh, and you need a permanent Internet connection too. On BOTH launchers ...
Ok, it is an multiplayer co-op game. But there is also a Singleplayer story part. But guess what? Same BS applies for entirely Singleplayer Ubisoft games too - e.g. all the Assassin's Creed games, etc.
So you need to run both uPlay-launcher AND Steam client to be able to run this game and you need a live internet connection. No playing offline or on a train or a flight. 

Double-DRM \o/  - Why suffer through one when you can have more?

So, now they start re-offering games on the Steam store again, after years, when they learned painfully that their hubris of being big and untouchable allowing them to stand completely on their own, disconnected from the world  in their own little walled garden was completely unfounded.
So they are back. You can buy Ubisoft games again on Steam and get lured into their launcher and account BS ... again...

Oh, and did I mention this game is mostly dead nowadays? Lucky to find someone in the game to co-op with you. Maybe you can convince a friend, but still you need both launchers, an account and permanent internet. Plus you are lucky if Ubisoft doesn't close down the servers and support soon, as they do for their games. 

No gaming for YOU! Thank you for your ""purchase"".

As for the game? Good. Fun. Interesting story and decent difficulty to not spoon-feed you. But as others have mentioned: stay away from Dark-Zone and PvP. Rogue bullies and cheaters are taking the fun out.
But story playthrough with a friend in co-op or some nice random party members is enjoyable for a while.

Would I still pay 30 € / $ ...whatever ...? Heck no! Why is it fashionable nowadays to ask full price on AAA games or similar, even after years (e.g. Far Cry Primal, Far Cry 5, Watch Dogs 2, Assassins Creed down the line of Black Flag even, Ghost Recon, etc. same story - insane pricing for sometimes 10 year old single player games).

This game have a lot of grinding and everyday I went to DZ there will always be new and exciting events happening around me. For those who asked, I'm fully geared and maxed out. I kill people in DZ for fun, some will say it's a unmoral move but to me it's super fun. I enjoy every bits of the grind and I'm still on the quest to craft that perfect MP-5, Vector, and AUG. If you like the feeling of grinding and like to see your character grow in stats and items then this game is definitely for you. For me it can be better when the new expansion pack hits and when they fix all the game broken bugs. I'll give it a 8/10.

""An unfortunate downfall to one of my life's most memorable moment"" 

To my best teammates: Kai, Jimbox, BillySheldon, BK, KCStoner, LilFish, Manzymzk, Jagxsta, KimboR91, and many more...

This is where it all started, meeting all walks of life in the extraction zone next to DZ1 West Entrance. By gone the countless times chased down by the whole lobby as a battle squadron of 4-men unstoppable team with dedicated fragger, IGL, healer, and support. The sweat the scream and shit talking all happened in-between the screeching noise made by EMP flashbang, shock turrets, and seeker mines. By gone the time when everyone runs around in circle and your heals have to be a green puddle or else be ready to be flame by your team. By gone the time when people of different nations team up to fight the hackers. We lived through the 1.3 time when 1 shot sentry build dominated the scenery, that's when the whole world think I'm a hacker and y'll stick by my side. We proved them wrong. Patch 1.5 the most balanced patch with countless drama happening, but we stick together, but this is when some of us decided to take hiatus, we thought it's only for a short time.. We were wrong. Last Stand and everything else is story for another day, perhaps when the memories come back I will add more. We showed them how good team work and dedication can achieve. We've achieved the unthinkable, pulling down those insane 4v16 in the DZ, getting more than 100 rogue kills regularly everyday. You guys even helped me made it to RANK 1 in the WORLD for rogue kills (Friz) for 2 weeks or so. We were having so much fun without knowing it to be the last time. 

Thank you guys for the experience and no matter where you guys are I hope you guys thrive, just like how we did in-game.

This hasn't affected The Division as much as other titles, but there are some titles that are completely unplayable now because they don't work on new Operating Systems but can't launch them on old ones that can actually run it. And this restriction of Windows 7 isn't for any reason other than cutting costs, the launcher itself still WORKS on Windows 7 if you copy an old version of the .exe file into the game, as Ubisoft Support themselves recommends.

SUPPORT THE OS YOU RELEASED THE GAME ON OR DONT SELL THE GAME.






After hitting level 30 I finally feel like I've experienced everything there is to do in this game. That is to say that I've done all the story missions and the same 3 side missions over and over until I hit level 30.

So far I'm feeling like there's absolutely no end game content at this point and there's nothing to do for level 30's except get killed by hackers in the dark zone. Yes, this game is FULL of hackers at level 30. The user's weapon stats are all saved client side and there's no check in place to make sure the files are unmodified so people can edit their stats to have damage be 1,000,000 (literally) and their armor stat be over 5,000 and they run around the darkzone just killing people for fun. (Edit:) I've looked into this issue more on the steam forums, and from my investigation, people are using CheatEngine. The simplest and most widely known file modification program around. I simply can't believe that Ubisoft didn't foresee this issue before the game launched since there was 'hacking' in the beta as well. Actually I can, it's Ubisoft. I've had this happen many times after reaching level 30.

The characters feel bland and uninteresting after you talk to them the first few times. Each safezone vendor has their own ""personality"", I put personality in quotation marks because they're simply different stereotypes that always stick to the same stereotypical archetype without fault. That is to say, one of them has allergies. No other character traits, literally just blathering on and on about the histamines and pollen in every single conversation. Then you have the stereotypical PTA homeowners association mother who's excuse for you doing her missions is that they're lowering the value of the neighborhood. There's the typical New York tough guy who threatens to 'crack ya head in' every chance he gets and so on. They're very boring, very repetitive and provide nothing to the story other than a different voice actor for the same 5 side missions over and over. They also seem to go out of their way to make note of the characters that are homosexual. Sure, that's all well and good but it's simply out of nowhere and just pandering for more attention. Sure Dr Kandal, I'll do a mission for you. Oh, you had a wife? Oh, and EX wife. Do you want me to save her? No? What's that? She's not even in the game? Why bother telling me then. 

At this point, absolutely DO NOT spend more than 25 dollars on this wreck of a game, maybe once they finally add some content or fix the ""hackers"" if you can even call them that.

Update: Incursions are out! I've never played them because of a bug when you attempt to join an Incursion in progress, you get stuck at a loading screen loop until you close out of the game and reopen it. But don't let that fool you, Ubisoft is patching the game. They've nerfed every farming method players have found so far. The Incursion update added a bug where each challenge mode boss would drop 4 high-end gear items. This was fixed in a hotpatch the day after Incursions were launched. Meanwhile; players are still falling through the ground for no explainable reason, getting booted off Ubisoft's god awful servers, getting CTD's hourly and, since the Incursion update, some players are even reporting their characters deleted with no word if they'll be recovered at all. All the while Ubisoft is busy patching all the bugs that don't affect players or the game in a negative way.

From all of these ""new"" experiences with the game, I would absolutely recommend you to STAY AWAY from this game completely, ignore it even if it goes on sale. The game had potential but Ubisoft simply killed it with their typical business practices and only seem to be making it worse each update.
I will gladly change my review to recommended when/if it ever becomes playable or enjoyable because it really truly did have a lot of potential and my hype for the game pre-launch was through the roof.",1458603009,1674691753,False,113,4,0.590891122817993164,4,True,False,False

it has just enough character/gear customizing to hold interest. Especially considering anything drops anywhere (with rare exceptions).

I spent most of my hours solo. Only grouping for content that was not doable/practical solo. top tier difficult things. You would run out of resources before completing it solo. 
BUT you can  gear out by your self, i did. Grouping will get you there 20x faster though lol.


Its weird writing a review on a game that already has a sequel to itself. 

IS this game worth playing now? for a new player, id say no and yes lol. Indecisive and unhelpful answer. 
The population isn't there. and the people who are on are so far ahead of you with gear and content, it'd take you forever to get close enough to them to be invited to things. Doable, yes, but probably not fun. your choice though.

This game hit close to home for me with the reminder of the COVID pandemic that we have been living the past 3 years which increase the believably of the game with the possible consequence of living this world in real life.  

The main story is a bit short and incomplete for my taste as there were some storylines that were left unexplained when you play the end game (which at that time I fought it was just another mission) and I found myself hitting a DLC pay wall thereafter.

The P v P v Bot game-play at the Dark Zone is alive and well as you still encounter people who are still enjoying what this world has for all of us.  I have since trying to max out my gears and weapons which help to progress my gaming time in this world longer.

I am a loner so I mostly play by myself, but sometimes I Join some pro players with there Full DPS builds, and is nice to help them. Other times I've matched up with a new player and help them complete missions, get items, and is fun too. Th

The way you make your load out, for me is very interesting.

things i enjoyed
The setting is great, the gun-play is balanced, recoil is realistic, movement is smooth like gliding butter through a hot pan, the map is great, (so far) no crashes, the animations are nice, the vanity loot box opening animation especially, the dlcs (so far I've played underground only but it is a ball). 
now the things i dislike
the character customization is rather limited, the player is more squishy at the start of the game, when enemies are stunned(i.e. blinded or set on fire) they will start to slide in a random direction with no animations, sniper [press tab] to zoom in kinda sucks and does not allow those insane quick scope plays, DZ is kinda toxic so be weary and turn of public voice chat, majority of pvp players are metamancers so just get ready to be wrecked if u have a sub-par build, a huge learning curve for pvp (certain talents are essential and there are a few movement tech and healing tech that need to be practiced and take a while to master).

The game still has technical issues that were never fixed, are well known to the developers from many player reports, and will never be fixed as the development is finished already.
Things like frequent CTD, can't go full screen without crashing, DX 12 won't let the game even start, and random FPS drops that can only be fixed with a restart.

I've spent dozens of hours on this between Ubisoft and Consoles (Beta Included). 

At this point I'm pretty much the master of the arts. 

I've done everything you can do but it's still fun to play with randoms and friends. 

I love the Holiday vibes from this game. Also reminds me of Escape from NY. 

You will be doing several missions to build your character up and getting towards the end game. 

It's like Gears of War with RPG elements mixed with tactical shooters like Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell. 

The dark zone and raids are unmatched to this day. Love grouping up and going deep. 

Prey to the digital gods you get some mythic gear. Almost max level on my account. 

10/10 So much better than Destiny 2 without a doubt. Can't wait for Division 2 Steam.

PVP isnt really for me but still seeing manhunts active in the  darkzone at WT5 and got straight into 3 last stand maps.
Survival is one of the best versions of that game type i've ever played. Thoroughly enjoy spending an hour getting to the dark zone, killing a hunter and extracting.

Resistance game modes - by far my favourite part of endgame. just love the endless waves type game modes. You can literally jump straight into a game - the matchmaking is pretty much instant for me (i play weekends & evenings).

Previous review below: (and all still apply)

This is a solid game with excellent graphics, rich backstory, tactical combat requiring cover and strategy, changing environment (weather, day/night), random encounters, immersive setting, challenging bosses (but not Souls-like), easy to follow leveling and progression as well as gear upgrading and crafting. 
I had low expectations for this game for some reason but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.   
Overall of the better shooter looter options out there and I find this more cerebral and entertaining. Looking forward to trying this with friends as it is cable of grouping for multiplayer. 
I'm 27 hours in and still only about half way through. Very impressed with the amount of content with different quests and I have not repeated any missions so far.

Otherwise, a solid shooter / looter rpg game and if you take your time and enjoy a snowy New York in a Christmas coat (and look at the nasty winter outside the window) (and don't exactly come across a pile of body bags in the game) (and don't exactly meet a cleaning patrol with a named boss) (or in DZ for two+ a brave rogue who will shoot your face with a shotgun at close range immediately after the arrival of the helicopter), it is a seriously breathtaking.  You just can't listen to call recordings, peek into progress videos and get lost in the moving echoes, because then you will naturally have to wonder what we humans are really about...

Positive Things:

If you enjoy being regularly disconnected from the server and losing an hours mission progress its a cracking game. If your the sort of gamer that enjoys a exp level based game where exp level means absolutely diddly squat resulting in NPCs a fraction of your level wiping you out with a hand gun you'll love this. If your into free roam games you'll positively get a hard on for the completely restrictive street level 'run to a mission down a street that looks just like the last one' game play (sarcasm). However you might not enjoy the fact your character frequently does not respond to commands until you're so full of lead you cant lift your pinkie finger or when they fail to move at all when stuck between suprisingly robust bin bags. Accuracy is more of a phiisophical concept as far as the weapons are concerned but when all's said is the least worrying thing when NPC headshot you through cars, from behind solid concrete planters or even better straight through civilians that you yourself cant shoot through. Un explained frame rate drops accompanied with the frustrating deaths that goes with that. You'll also suffer from the fact that the med-kit button (V) is right next to the inventory button (B) that causes you to frequently get slaughtered by opening the real time menu while in combat (cant change this key binding which is complete effing BS). Weapons that look good from their stats but do in fact do less damage than a super soaker. Flame throwers that can penetrate solid barriers but weabons with 7.62 AP rounds that cant penetrate a hoodie. 'Armor' is more for show than protection because no matter what you wear your base level rookie with a pistol will kill you dead. Oh and the multiple deaths of 'Alex' the fkin rioter who is contantly being mourned by his fellow AI literally every other bloody kill.  Aside from all that the ABSOLUTE most gut wrenchingly frustrating, teeth grinding, soul crushing thing is that it could have been an incredible game. The atmosphere is good, the background sound is good, the story line is cracking and the actual graphics are still standing up now but as Ubisoft usually does (apart form with farcry) they produced a half baked game. It bugs the hell out of me. I deeply want them to have put the extra work in because this had all the hall marks of a great game format but just produced something underwhelming.

It's funny buying this in 2022 because you get swarmed with supply drops and the game sends you notifications for them for like 5 minutes but they are kinda useless past level 4-5 and if you did like me, got the free trial to level 8, none of it is useful, but hey it's infinite cheap crafting materials.

It also gives you about 500k of stuff you can't really use, so it kind of messes up the early progression since you don't need to loot anything for money and are already rich.

There are still plenty of people playing so the multiplayer holds up well, especially once you reach end game. The guns feel punchy and movement is slick for the most part, even though I'm not a fan of only being able to do a scripted climb/vault instead of free jumping on and off things.

World atmosphere and artwork are great and fit the setting. Base building is fun and feels relevant as it makes complete sense in the game world. Not so good is the repetitive missions, they can get exhausting after a while (same thing copy pasted over and over on a huge map in the typical Ubisoft fashion). Narrative is cool but it's mostly found in the collectables.

Darkzone wasn't for me, it feels unbalanced in a way that's unfun to me. I would say the game has plenty to offer without DZ though, so this didn't draw from the experience.

if you like mindless point and shoot games, this is for you btw

cons

once you're in the game for the first 10 or so minutes you will be spammed on the ingame ui with notifications that you've received some cosmetics or whatever, one at a time (there's like 50)

there's a button prompt to fall off a fucking ledge for fucks sake

very dull combat, it's just, go behind cover, peak out of cover, shoot, go behind cover and reload, repeat until all enemies are dead, once you've fought the first few enemies you fought them all, there's no strategy at all other than very basic flanking to be undertaken when fighting

if you're on pc the controls will feel weird, things like having to double tap spacebar to roll, climbing being under ctrl and not something more intuitive like spacebar, game has some slightly janky cover system as a replacement for the ability to crouch for some reason

very similar to destiny 2 allthough destiny 2 is at least more fast paced, you can shut off half your brain while playing this

I apologise for this very long read, but if you are going to write a review then you go into depth and explain aspects of the game! Writing ""it's a good game and should buy it"" is not a review and not helpful at all and should be removed from the page!

Yes the game is just released but I played this far back in Gamescom 2015 and then the closed beta and now release, so my review is very clear! Also not much of the game has changed since then so I have a very valid point!

Let's get into the liars that are Ubisoft!

Graphics: We all remember the first announcement of this game, walking through the streets and we all looked in aw... Then most of us came back to reality because we remembered this is Ubisoft! 

So the graphics are not what you all expect and they are massively changed and toned down compare to what we seen! 

When playing this game at Gamescom 2015 I thought the graphics where terrible, I mentioned to the Devs and they said it's not a final build, so I thought okay that is fair... Yet the game I am playing right now looks exactly the same as what I played. 
The graphics are fairly decent to play but nothing extreme to what we all are expecting!

Here, this video better explains it: http://youtu.be/fW6kehLgXdY

Audio: The gameplay audio is basic run gun, shooting tooting sounds. There is not even any atmosphere aspect of the game, when walking around the sounds are basic and offering no depth to the game! So to me, it's just a basic sound game and no real draw in!
Also the guns sound like toy guns for some unknown reason! Makes no sense why it sounds weird.

Controls: The controls are simple to get used too, nothing special and can be changed to the way you like them. They are easy to manage and get used too but the character can handle odd at times!

Gameplay: The gameplay is an open world aspect, which more or less feels like an arena closed off to everything else.  You gather missions, kill people, rank up and find special drops but that is it! Nice aspect is you can sneak and surprise enemies! 

The game is best played with your friends, small group of 4 and if anymore then make another group and meet up to do 'certain' tasks together but that's it. Unless in the dark zone which is the PVP aspect of the game. (Which is where it feels Ubisoft is trying to push 90% of the time is that section of the game, even though it's boring)

Each mission you complete and handle gains you character recognition to build up the area you are in. You can bring back the society with each mission, that is how it feels but not how it looks! Even the social areas that are ranked up and it's blossoming in life (the more you go) but you leave that and some how there are enemies wondering extremely close to the base, which becomes confusing on what and why you are doing what you are doing. 

There is not really much to explore, find and search for the loot aspect. The map is small and confined to the streets basically with some inside sections but from what I can tell, only accessible when on the mission, otherwise closed off. We cannot enter buildings or houses to search for stuff, SOME and I mean some buildings are accessible, but it is so limited you would not believe... It's not that type of game! You are clamped down into long streets, some ladders to climb to a small area, longer streets and lots of running back and fore, you would not believe how basic and bland this map really is compared too what they hyped and lied about the map actually being!

Nice feature of the game is the customisation! Even the HUD on the game is semi customisable... Resizing, arranging around where you want it and so on!

Also forgot DayZ Walking Simulator! This is by far the biggest walking/ running simulator around! (DayZ now added vehicles to remove the walking sim) but anyway, this is walk or run, depends how you feel... bad some bad guys, shoot shoot, cover, shoot, heal, shoot, run some more, run some more, ooo, find a nice loot box with green items in, then continue to run, run, run and then a friend says ""You can fast travel to certain places"" Thus then saving some time, but when out it is even more running! Running! There are vehicles in the game... but they are obstacles to climb or go around, that is it! 

(You cannot jump off a vehicle or walk off, he stands on the edge and you must press a key to get off, otherwise the invisible wall holds you there no matter what you are ontop off)

There is barely any missions to actually do for the story driven part! - The game is designed for you to grind the same missions over and over and over and over and over and over (You get the point so I will stop there) on a harder difficulty to get some better loot... That is pretty much the system of the game, otherwise it is dark zones but even there it becomes tiring and boring after a set period of time.  Clearly Ubisoft did not care about the story of the game considering it is EXTREMELY short!

There is hardly anything to do in the game, seriously! The main focus of the game feels like and looks like a small red part of the map (Dark Zone) where they want players to fight and kill, that is it.  REALLY that is IT!

Ubisoft here has focused on multiplayer ONLY 14 main story missions, which can be done in about 5hours

The game is based around loot which makes your character better, basically like Diablo 3 style! Almost identical to the game with the gear to make you a certain way and better etc!

They have tried to make an MMORPG, but this does not feel like an MMO at all... It feels like a small confined semi tactical shooter, with minimal loot aspects and straight approaches to things... That is my opinion!

Now everything else after above!

Ubisoft are more like a console developer with a PC porter! If you google then you will find that they are the new early access games... Not really finished games, also a huge bunch of liars, thieves and no good for nothing company, but continue to make games and charging insane prices and not being sued!?!? This should change!

I would say it started with Watch Dogs! We all remember seeing and then getting a game was totally different to what we seen, but had certain aspects of the original game we seen, then assassins creed (A game that did not work completely) and so much more games after where they shown one thing, but released another... 
Even Rainbow Six Siege was betrayed as one but we got another!

When The Division was announced, they said that the PC will contain a far superior game and be the better platform to play, yet when you do some Googling.. You will find a statement from Ubisoft saying ""They had to keep the PC version in check with the console because we do not want the PC to get to far away from them, making it unfair"" Which is Ubisoft for you... A console developer, PC Porter and will say one thing, show one thing but make another!

We seen The Division a few years back, we where promised so much and yet we got this game with missing so much! They brushed up on many things like a drone with players joining via tablets, that was removed, they said about a huge map and even openly promoted this (there is a YouTube video that even explains this) and yet they completely lied and less a false information to support the hype of the game in false promotion. Plus so much more. Google/ YouTube has a ton of this information so do not just take my word for it!

I am trying so hard to like this game, I had so much hype I cannot explain to anyone but Ubisoft have ruined it all for me and I am trying to enjoy this game with friends but I am finding it very hard!

Would I recommend this game? I want to say yes I really do, based on the company behind it and what they have done lately! I am going to say no, 70% of it, there are some positives but not much and lots has changed since what we was promised and got!",1457394597,1672069162,False,7,0,0.62103271484375,14,True,False,False

You most likely have heard about The Division 2 or have even played it before thumbing through these reviews, so you're probably here asking, ""should or play this one? Or should I skip ahead/stick with the sequel?""

You should play this one. Maybe you don't need to assemble a team of friends to fill a practically archaic lobby, but what you need to do is set aside some time to run through the campaign on single player and *experience* one of the most stunning games worlds you'll ever immerse yourself in. Really take it in, because I doubt we'll have another division title quite like it and I worry support for it will very soon drop off.

The story isn't anything particularly moving, but it's leagues ahead of the sequel in terms of believability, attention to detail, and motivation. The sequel severely lacks real motivation to complete the tasks they set out for you, whereas the first title not only gives you a distinct plan from beginning to end how you are going to take the city back, but implements it in your progression as it is divided into the three areas of military, technology, and medical. These upgrades are both statistical and seen in gameplay/RPG character builds, but also in the story and world. The multiple factions are relatable enough to be interested in their inception, and although the encounters/events (side quests) are often painful, soulless duplicates of each other, the characters feeding you info over comms from each of the safehouse are each unique and personable, a golden piece of writing in an otherwise dull storyline.

One could argue this is also a part of the explanation on story, but the world itself is immensely gorgeous, but detailed down to the fucking minute pieces, as you traverse 12-foot tall piles of trash, collapsed subways, and abandoned safe areas, detail and creativity with apocalyptic elements I've yet to see in games other than this series and The Last of Us. Beyond the visual appeal, it is also one of the most immersive experiences I've ever had, especially from a third-person view where I've always preferred first person for immersion. Most notable are the missions underground and simply wandering the snow looking for countless audio entries and hidden supplies.

All.in all, what really sets this game apart from playing what most people call a superior sequel is the immersive single player experience. I played this game entirely solo, completed every event, and still find things to enjoy doing just so I have an excuse to return to this beautifully mastercrafted city left devastated by collapse. The sequel does a lot of things better, and is still quite well detailed and depicted, but nothing quite captures the single-strap backpack, beanie-wearing agent creeping between ruined skyscrapers in the cold snow you can feel through the screen.

Set in a scaled down New York and build upon the Snowdrop Engine, this game looks and feels fantastic. The attention to detail in the world is simply astonishing with so many streets, interiors and landmarks all littered with stuff. The snowy backdrop and eerie silence of the streets just oozes a very unique atmosphere. 

Coming up to 7 years old, it's still worth playing even just to finish the story missions. The narrative is quite poor and the missions aren't hugely varied but exploring the city, building your character and the combat is great fun throughout. At worst, you'll definitely get a good 25 hours out of it and even more with friends. 

It's a real pity Ubisoft play their games so safe these days. This was actually a really original and promising concept that even with a sequel, they failed to expand upon. This is definitely the better of the two titles.",1670954661,1670954730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Didn't enjoyed the crap constant leveling and quick uselessness of the weaponry and the constant need for upgrading against an ever stronger enemy.  There is probably a game design argument for it,  but its annoying nonetheless. This constant need to spend game money to get better weaponry and armor. Even more difficult with a vendor system that only nets 10 percent for a sold weapon. There should be a perk or skill for better prices and bartering. That ties into the over powered stupidity of the boss battles. Gold level bosses need 20-30 headshots with a purple weapon to go down.  After a while this redundant repetition in each of the zones just got boring.  Sure I'm laying this solo,  and the game is probably balanced for 4 person coop,  but I gamed up to level 21, and I'm uninstalling this piece of inadequate frustration.  
I will the say voice acting work is exceptionally good.  Very New Yorker authentic. And the structural design of the rebuilding in the face of utter destruction has a well thought out purpose and common sense to it.   So there's good in here as well.  And it did hold my interest for 38 hours,  so there's that too.
[edit]
So re installed,  and kept going for the story,  which is always the driving force in good games. I'm at level 29 now,  and just cleared the grand central station assault. Again,  stick with this for the story and the world created. 
[edit]
The game play changes drastically when you hit level 30,  allowing for better weapons and gear and the entire game experience is exponentially better. With unlocked gold weapons a lot of the earlier frustration evaporates,  allowing for better immersion.  Lots of purple and gold items drop and these can be sold to get what you need to challenge the end game scenario and Camp Clinton.  Make sure to stash and store gear mods and weapon attachments.  They come in useful through  out the game.  Having  level 1 scope with 15x magnification,is better than a 4x level 30.",1670006302,1670368546,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can't believe I never left a review for this game.

This is one of my all time favorite games, just for the atmosphere and the story alone. This game also has great characters, funny moments, and good villains. A great addition to the Tom Clancy Library.

This game has some downsides. Game play gets a bit repetitive, and some gameplay aspects seem a bit dumb but I believe this game is very worth it if you can grab it on sale with all the DLCs.

This game had a horrible start. From the downgrade that ""Ubisoft"" made and keeps making, since the released day, were we had already countless bugs and connecting issues, and it seemed to be unfixable. But that, for a new ""AAA"" title, is just a disaster. Don't forget also the year were the Division released we had also some very good ""AAA"" titles were they looked very good and promising. And that for the Division makes it more difficult. That's the reason why it lost that many players.

Almost two years past since the game is up and running. And Ubisoft with Massive Entertainment spend resources and money to fix it as much as better they could. With every patch they fixed something but also they brought and something new. Now on 2018 the player base went larger than before and also we have 3 different expansions were they are very entertaining to spend some time with your friends, or of course, solo if you're a lone wolf on games.

In conclusion the game was keep getting better and better but of course some little things weren't fixed because it was just too late, anyway, they've done a realy good work and that was noticed to us. My personal opinion is that, they realy made a come back to the gaming community and for what they are capable of doing. I hope they learned a lesson from this and just keep making great games that our time is worth giving.

Sincerely,

For PvE you have missions with different difficulties, incursions, underground, resistance, side missions encounters , and the darkzone with landmarks and survival.

It got a lot of trash talk because on launch, a lot of players couldn't get on, me included (back on PS4). And a lot of promised features (such as playing from a tablet) were cut. But looking at it now, it's solid. Story is forget able but still okay enough to understand why YOU are there.

Up to 4 players can drop in and drop out on the host's map, meaning they can progress their main objectives with you and replay chunks they themselves have already done. The more the better in this game. There is a lot of replay value here; raising the difficulty, redoing a section simply because you loved it, even if it's a story bit, it never got old to me. However, it got old to most, seeing as the enemies have few skins, are bullet sponges later on, and well, the ''ending'' is a huge letdown. The DLCs in themselves are nothing too noteworthy, however if you enjoy the mechanics, they can be satisfying. The base game tends to have you run around in an empty city where mostly thugs and factions roam the streets, with the occasional civilian that asks for an item and give you a piece of clothing to customise your character (leather jacket, a beanie, a scarf, boots). It can feel like an empty space. Run here, run there, it all looks the same. It's all the same enemies. But the mechanics! Oh, that's what I enjoyed.

If I'm to sum up what this game is about and why it definitely gets a thumbs up from me is... 
Well it's from the combat; get into cover, move seamlessly about your cover and around corners of said cover, emptying your clip blind or while aiming, use your skills that aren't on cool down.
The customisation of your guns with bonuses to aiming, scopes, bigger mags and more, while all the different armors with buffs to health, armor or cool down reductions, etc...
This is with randomised loot dropped from batches of enemies, chests scattered around in the environment, from rare elites or instances bosses, chests, or in the PvP areas. 
There is even a subtle aggro system which isn't explained enough, but once you get into it is a massive thing to plan your party around.

One of the coolest thing is what's called the Dark Zone. Players can enter it and all that co-op is meddled. You can loot from the usual enemies, which are much tougher, bosses, or chests which require a ''dark zone level'', which goes up with most actions you do in the dark zone, and which can also go down when you die. The equipment you will find there is the best in the game, however you need to call in a chopper to have it extracted and identified upon exit. And here's where it's chaotic; other players can and will kill you. Even those on your team can. When you die, you drop the dark zone equipment you were collecting and trying to extract, and they can then try to extract it themselves. When someone kills you in the dark zone, everyone knows their approximate location, and get rewarded for your their death. Once you've extracted your items, however, they are forever yours to keep. What you come with is yours. What you're trying to acquire... Well, good luck.

So in short, I enjoyed it a lot. because what it DID do right, it did near perfectly. But it is repetitive for most. The second entry is more of this, with more colors and a different stats system.",1667731449,1667731809,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Go just about anywhere in this detailed replication of New York if you have the skill. And the help. Great exploration and loot. Great cover system and gun play. However...

If you expect to play solo, think otherwise. Even small quests involve lots of enemies in multiple levels. Without help you won't get very far. If you die, you go back to a check point. If you don't finish the quest before going off line, you don't go to that check point. You go to the start of the quest. Heaven forbid if you have to go off line because the kids are hungry or the wife frisky. No playing for an hour before going to work. Of course dealing with Ubisoft is as frustrating as ever.

I have to say, the performance of this game compared to D2 is #1.

I never crash. D2 crashes for me on a constant basis.

There's less bullet sponges.

It's more fast paced.

Enemy AI is more aggressive.

The Dark Zone is much better than D2.

Survival, Incursions, more challenging gameplay....

Don't get me wrong, I love all the crazy builds of D2, but the performance, gameplay and simplicity of D1 is so much better.

Did I mention D1 never crashes?

The main story can be completely solo-ed, but friends can join to help you. 
There is no need to play PvP to get the best gear in game, everything can be optained in single player mode.
Co-op missions are a good source for loot during ""Global Events"".
It's up to four player co-op and with the right mix of people you can have tons of fun. 

This is an always online game, because you can join other players missions or story mode on the fly.

-have an easy mode (as opposed to just normal and hard -which are both HARD-).

The gameplay is nice, playing with someone is better, but playing alone is cool too. I played the whole story twice, once on the PS4, and once again on the PC. I was arrogant enough to play all of the missions on hard, and it is quite hard. The enemies are bullet sponges, so if you don't like that kind of game, this isn't for you. 

The best part, IMO, is the setting. A snowy, dark, foggy New York City delivers an amazing atmosphere. And the graphics are fantastic! Even now, 6 years after launch, this game will tank my RTX 3060 when playing at 4k with everything maxed out. But the result is excellent! This game is insanely beautiful!

The other thing that I enjoyed a lot from this game world, is just how dense it is. The streets of NY are one thing, but it is actually possible to get a little lost in this game because a lot of buildings have detailed interiors with mulitple rooms and multiple floors. There are sewers that connect to metro stations. You can find a little shortcut and go through a building, or climb a building entirely. The exploration is just superb!

The base game delivers so much that even the DLC may seem a bit pointless. I have played over 100 hours on two platforms, and I feel like I am just playing it superficially. There is so much more than I haven't done. There is PVP, the underground, the dark zone, survival mode, and just the overworld after you finish the story. One of the most fun gaming sessions I've had was playing the Survival mode from the DLC. I spent like 4 hours exploring a dark, gloomy NY trying to scavenge whatever I could find, and trying not to engage the very hostile enemies. It is just so much fun!

Lot of grinding for upgrades on gear, storyline was decent and lot of side quests or pieces to find to add into the story / lore.

""The darkzone"" is the pvp area where its impossible almost to stay alive and get loot out, the AI enemies aren't the problem as its mainly the other players who camp around or follow you unseen until the AI knock your health and they can finish you off then steal all your loot for themselves.

[b]The Game:[/b] Tom Clancy's The Division (just ""the Division"" for the remainder of this review) is a great little online RPG game by Ubisoft! I'm amazed too that Ubisoft was able to pull of making an entirely new franchise and not have it completely suck like many other Ubisoft games (Watch_Dogs for example).

[b]Gameplay:[/b] The Division plays great, in my opinion anyways, and I am playing it on the PC (Windows 64-bit). The controls (keyboard and mouse in my case) feel natural and ""correct"". The game does not feel ""choppy"" or ""blocky"" like most multi-platform TPS (Third Person Shooters). Most of the time the camera just feels all wrong when using the mouse, but not the Division so kudos to Ubisoft for making the game feel great on PC when using PC controls.

In addition to ""feeling"" correct while playing on PC, the game actually plays correctly too. The only bugs I've ever really had were just latency bugs (I'd kill two enemies but the game wouldn't ""kill"" them until suddenly all at once - this has only happened 4-5 times total and the ""lag"" lasts no longer than 2 seconds tops).

[b]Game Performance (PC):[/b] The Division runs great on PC (in my case, right now an Alienware 18"" laptop with SLI). I'm not running it at maximum settings on this laptop (though it does run at max settings on my desktop); either way however The Division looks great - regardless of the computer I'm on. The game doesn't seem to suffer from lagging and other performance issues like Console Games on PC (aka shit ports like GTA IV and even GTA V).


[b]The Play ""Feel"":[/b] The way this game feels is pretty much covered in the above paragraph; however I may as mention it in specific detail here. The Division feels like an online RPG Third-Person-Shooter and on PC it feels like it was made for PC, again stuff I've already stated. As far as the way runs/feels/etc. though I will give it a seperate score for this. For being a decent game or even port (if it is) it doesn't feel bad so it gets [b]4 out of 5[/b] stars for the ""Feel"".


[b]Manhatten (PvE):[/b] All of your non-PvP quests for leveling your standard level and whatnot takes place outside the ""Dark Zone"" in the middle of the game's map. In this area you simply do PvE quests against NPCs, you don't end up fighting any actual players (PvP) until you are in the Dark Zone - which has its own leveling system versus the PvE leveling system (you level differently and they have no influence on each other).

[b]The Dark Zone (PVP):[/b] The Dark Zone is The Division's PvP Zone. Here player Agents can go ""rogue"" and kill you; they usually do this while you are waiting for your extraction for 90 seconds after launching your flare. Not all agents have to go Rogue however; if you choose not to you instead, will be killing these rogue agents. My knowledge on The Division's Dark Zone isn't the most complete; however I am aware that once you shoot off your flare, there is an intense wait for gear/player extraction. Other players can see your flare shoot off and will come for you for the loot you're extracting; so be careful and if you can - go to the Dark Zone with friends (up to 4 people per group).


[b]Overall:[/b] Tom Clancy's The Division is a great Online (MMOish) Third-Person Tactical Shooter. In the non-Dark Zone areas it's a PvE game and once in the Dark Zone it's PvE with PvP thrown in as well. I must caution to watch out for higher ""Dark Zone"" level players while you're a low level. They tend to kill you just because they can - half the time they don't even bother taking loot; or they'll steal all your loot but let you live - so be aware of that too. Otherwise I highly recommend The Division to anyone who is into the Tom Clancy series of games, or is into games with a realistic story, or just into online games (or third-person shooters). I should add that the maximum amount of players per ""Dark Zone"" instance, I believe, is 24 players (including you and your teammates if you're with any). Either way, while that 90 seconds may be intense - it sure is fun waiting with your buddies to see just how much shit is going to go down!

[b]Other Thoughts:[/b] Other than what I've previously mentioned; I don't have much else to add to this review. I hope it was sufficient enough to help anyone out with making the decision of weather to get The Division or not. I'd say yes it's worth it - but me and all my buddies think it is. For those of you who aren't my buddies or me - just make up your own mind because nobody is better at giving you an opinion than yourself! ;)


[b]Overall Score:[/b] 3/5 - [b]UPDATE - 2017[/b] This game's Dark Zone has become a living hell - I don't feel like rewriting the whole review on the Dark Zone and such; but yeah my recommendation and score are changing; though the review may not make sense now.",1459632813,1660977397,True,2,0,0.496183216571807861,0,True,False,False

TLDR Massive entertainement doesn't deserve your time and money and this IP should absolutely be given to another studio. 

To explain:
This product was a downgraded broken mess that massive never fixed,  taking month to address issues, bullshiting and lying to the community weeks after weeks, empty promises, making the same mistakes over and over, the absolute worst balancing ever in a video game, the continuous broken patches after broken patches, the continuous unfinished content releases after unfinished content releases. The sequel was started a day after launch, that pretty much tells you how massive never really planned to make this game live up to it's potential or just finish this game. Lazy/Stupid mechanic/broken/unfinished/untested are words that comes up  regularly when talking about massive's work even in the sequel today. 
The last year of Div1 life cycle (3rd year) being the most awfull because despite the game awfull last patch being completly broken and not ever addressed, devs explained that fixing things would take work and therefore they wouldn't do it because of the sequel coming  like 9 month after, then they had the balls to make a lootbox update that paywalled emotes. They did that to people (like me) that stayed despite two years of mismanagement and repeated fuck up showing just that massive doesn't really respect its community. 

All in all i can't recommand this series because of that company behavior (witch is repeating with the division 2) and i wish this project, if it was to be remake, would be handle by another studio completely.

I'll analyze WHY as a proficient end-game player at gear score 290.

If you play this game for long enough, it will give you three-stage feelings:
1. Frustrating: Before reaching level 30, this game is considered hard, you'll have to do lots of missions and skill stuff to NOT to be killed by a bullet-sponge enemy.
2. Entertaining: After reaching level 30, you'll start getting classified gears and have a feeling that enemies are easier to kill, but still they are huge sponges.
3. Unfulfilling: You want to collect all classified gears, but you'll find out that the RNG in this game is deliberately designed, so that you'll never get a full classified gear by ONLY doing LZ boss farming or Global Events or other things like that. It will keep giving you some specific classified gears and you'll notice lots of duplicates.

In short, the more you want to collect a full set of classified gears, the more frustrating you will be. If you want to play this game, don't be a perfectionist, otherwise you'll waste lots of time.

The only pro of this game is graphics, otherwise I can think of nothing.

Details of RNG in this game: Although the official said the chance of dropping classified gears is 6% atm, they didn't say anything about WHAT kinds of gears to drop. I kept farming LZ bosses and use a sheet to record the drops. I noticed that I hadn't have any new classified gear drops after about 50 times of farming, 50 times! There are 15 bosses, so statistically it should drop about 1 classified gear in one farm. But still nothing new after 50 times. There are always about 2-3 classified gears in any set that I will never have a chance to get.

I can understand why they designed RNG like this, because they want the players to participate in all kinds of activities and keep playing as a proficient player in the team. So skilled players like me or you now can attract more novice players just like you and me in the past and that means sustained income, because they've got servers and developers to feed, of course.",1512783309,1659615183,False,4,2,0.438348114490509033,1,True,False,False

As of now it's a solid third-person cover-based looter shooter.  You should *not* expect a tactical experience, though, and should be expecting the third-person shooter version of an action-RPG; this includes enemies with tankier health bars.  While the UI for navigating through all the loot you'll begin to horde leaves something to be desired, there is some build variety as you start to earn gear sets (unique gear that gains benefits based on how many pieces of it you have).

While the start of the game can be a bit slow to get rolling there is a decent endgame experience to be had with daily/weekly bounties, Incursions (raids), The Underground (repeatable missions made up of stitched together tilesets), a wave/horde mode, and the Dark Zone if you want to try your luck at some PvEvP

What I think is the stand-out mode, though, is Survival.  While it isn't great for grinding loot, it is a really great mode for the experience every now and then.  Either PvE or PvEvP, you are dumped into a freezing cold New York with survival elements (hypothermia/thirst/hunger/infection) while you power-level through the loot progression to get to the Dark Zone to complete an objective and call in a evac.",1659451493,1659451493,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are epic as well. Living in Chicago and knowing winters from there and other places in the country, I couldn't believe the way the sun would look on things. It was so accurate!!! From the slush look to the way the sky looks. All really well done. 

My only gripe would be sometimes being on whatever wall, you get so attached that you can't get off easy. Or, you make a wrong twist and you detach when you don't want to. But, those aren't major issues to me. It just takes getting used to. 

I recommend the game. It's simple, not really complicated. And the way it's set up, your grind isn't that hard but hard enough. Oh and you can even adjust that!

The solo journey through the story campaign whilst clearing each area and trying to level up till level 30 was actually somehow pretty fun.
And true for some parts that enemies can be bullet sponge especially when you tried to fight one that is one or two levels above you, and if same level probably only on the elite or mini-boss types and you are not dealing crit damages at all.
Reached level 30, then ventured a bit on Dark Zone solo, and now at last at Gear Score 278, I believe it's time to end this.
Dailies can be fun, didn't try Incursions yet, and HVTs are there for more activities, I guess. Suddenly also not motivated to complete all the collectibles.

If you like looter shooter, pick this one, 'cause hell I don't really go for those kinds but this one is pretty interesting.
Might pick The Division 2 if by some miracle it come to Steam, if not, then I won't ever touch it.
Story kinda pretty good, might pick the DLCs sometime later if the servers still alive.
OVERALL RECOMMENDED, even better if you have friends to play around the mobs too. xD",1657504785,1657504785,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

We weren't sure at the time if it was going to become our reality. We both really enjoyed this incredibly detailed world of a post apocalyptic New York City where you could walk into an insignificant building, only to discover a hidden story of an NPC through the environment or a recording picked up. It almost felt as unique in detail and character as a real event might be when over time you learned the horrible events that happened in this city and why. The combat was extremely fun and you could get very creative and strategic with the secondary tech like sticky bomb or turret. The factions of competing groups and bosses were well developed. Unlocking a new video or killing an enemy faction leader just added more depth. It was very hard at times considering you can mag dump all your ammo into some bosses and they still don't die, but it still engaged us to finish the game and keep trying. The gear system and crafting was awesome and it felt like Christmas to pick up a weapon or armor that suddenly gave you an edge over the competition. The community aspect of it was not bad either and you could get another player to help you clear out a boss you were having trouble with. I went on to play the Division 2, but the magic was gone from that game. It lacked something in detail to what this game certainly possessed for us.

365590,117770986,76561198280167220,0,7,1373,0,131,1707696164,"This game is a typical example of bad mechanics, rushed development for shareholder and company profits, as well as ideas thrown at a wall to see what sticks. I loved the levels, the atmosphere, the animations of the characters, and how smooth movement seemed up until it kept prompting you to hit A to slam against cover....
But then the rushed development and completely unbalanced and ridiculously hard gameplay occurred...

This is not a matter of ""Get Gud"" as many noobs would say, this game is straight up unbalanced and broken. 

How you say? Easy...

1.) You will not get any good gear Vs. your actual level, and pickups are next to useless. 
2.) Enemies are aimbot cheaters, some can actually shoot right through cover, they always know EXACTLY were you are, and have unlimited amounts of grenades and ammo at ALL TIMES defeating the purpose of you having limited ammo and grenades as well as using stealth as they will just find you anyways. 
3.) The game will give you pretty easy missions, then random thrust you into a insanely hard mission next to imnpossible, with enemy AI again, always knowing were you are and always throwing endless grenades that somehow can find you no matter were your at. They toss them like professional football players for christ sake! But no, you can't do that too, it has to make sure you wicked limited in range because ""Reasons"".
4.) Players talk too much sh*t, and randomly you get kicked from groups all the time by control freak morons. Even if you start a group, they can kick YOU. Fun! I love waiting about 10 - 20 mins to get a group together via quick match and then just get kicked mid mission which resets EVERYTHING. 
5.) Your weapons are nerfed AF while enemy combatants have super powered maxed out weaponry that most the time, if not at all, you cant even pick up from the bodies!
6.) This game is grindy AF! It is really really bad, and many times the enemy AI will be far far above your skill level, even if it reads same level, they have abilites far far beyond their level, because ""Reasons"".
7.) Simply put, the damn game does indeed cheat to favor itself. I've experienced numerous times, and it is unacceptable. I've even seen enemy AI get back up AFTER they are killed, and motionless for about 30 seconds. Not to mention endless spawning of enemies, even if it says your clear at times. That's glitched AF. 
8.) Very very very repetitive missions and goals. Run, shoot, maybe collect something, move on, repeat. You have rescue missions, hostage missions, look for and find missions, but they all end up the same mission as you ALWAYS ensue in a unbalanced gun fight. So really, the missions are all exactly the same unless of course, the computer cheats and endlessly respawns enemies, using unlimited ammo and grenades. always fun to have to deal with. 
9.) Again, stealth is almost useless, and trying to think ahead while being quiet is almost useless most the time as the game throws you right into a group of alerted AI during some missions. When they can shoot right through cover when clearly, they should not be able to, like middle of walls, through entire buildings, through the damn ground, just for a few examples, topped off with aimbot perfect shots and endless ammo and grenades, it is very very frustrating. Makes it pointless to level or get better gear and weapons. Literally, it doesn't matter, the AI will just kill you anyways very quickly in many situations. 
10.) Spawning after dying, oh my god....sure, lets just throw you way way way back, so you can run all the way back for no reason, no extra AI, no items, nothing, while the game remembers you used items before dying and does not replenish it!! Really guys, really?? All while I fight perfect aimbot AI with endless ammo and grenades??

All I can say is, you do not need to play this entire game to get bored with it very quickly and clearly see the rushed development issues and glitches with this game. I do not recommend this game unless you and a few friends like that type of old school arcade style of play were mechanics really don't matter too much. Not to mention the RPG elements are also completely unbalanced, but then again, the devs clearly have never dabbled in a RPG before so it really does show. 

I really wanted to like this game, but the amount of frustration and clear cheating by the AI is too much. I'm here to play a Tom Clancy game, not a stupid impossible Dark Souls wanna be shooter and looter. Idk why, but Ubisoft just takes Clancy;s name and throws it on every tactical game they make, thinking we as the public are stupid enough to believe that because of that, the game will be amazing. Yeah, no, I think the last good game with his name tied to it was Rainbow Six 3, ever since that it has become copies of other franchises and their game mechanics. Ubisoft clearly has become just like Activision, Blizzard, and EA, and the greed as well as the idiots they hire to order around the dev teams and who keep rushing the devs to make a game just to have a product to over hype and sell, is clearly and blatantly showing. Ubisoft is not even trying to hide it anymore and they clearly never learn as long as a few stupid people keep buying their games, it will continue to happen. I cant even imagine how the division 2 is, probably much worse...

If your a fan boy of the Tom clancy and Ubisoft modern day garbage games, you will love this game.

If your a die hard fan of the series when the games were actually good and not rushed, this is by far one of the worst Ubisoft has to offer.",1656393914,1656393914,False,6,4,0.502191364765167236,0,True,False,False

The 'UI' is quite ugly and takes some time to get figured out, the map is way too cluttered all the time without giving the user the option to filter some junk out.

The pvp is fun but there are some builds that just MELT you. It seems like you either have a PVE build, or a PVP build. If you have a pve build you will get melted in pvp, if you have a pvp build you will get melted by mobs. I wish there was moire of a balance but thats just the way it is, maybe after i get my build 100% optimized with classifieds it will be better. The base game is pretty dead but the Dark Zone is always poppin in my region, which is surprising considering The Division 2 is out. I will not buy Division 2 because the environments look boring and not detailed and they have nowhere near the atmosphere of one. Also I heard some of the mechanics became watered down.

The good
The city is gorgeous.
The guns and equipment are cool.
Main missions are usually good, and provide checkpoints (usually).
I could easily solo the whole game.

The meh
Side missions aren't bad, but there's a bit too much repetition. Not a fan of the water supply and find the virus box type missions.
Some cooler perks would've been nice.
No interest in the multiplayer but now in 2022 it seemed a bit quiet.
Guns are realistic, but you're fighting bullet-sponge style.

The bad
The characters, story and general faux-apolitical flavor of the game are stale and uninspired. The gab from the regional heads of each area was lame, since they were annoying stereotypes and comic relief that didn't fit with the rest of the game. Playing solo is kinda lonely.
The usual Ubisoft BS.

i used to play this game religiously back on console when the game was newish and i loved it! great game to hangout with mates decent PvP mostly PvE tho. but good game in general. the grind to get better loot / gear is hard due to anyone can take your items that you haven't extracted from the dark zone yet.

It's sad that Ubisoft has taken this great game and downgraded it when they published Division 2... The Division 1 is a great game, ya it had it's moments, but at the end, they really turned this game into something special. Would I recommend this game today? The answer to that is yes. The campaign is awesome. The end game will keep you playing to optimize and get the best gear possible. I feel it's also appropriate to give Survival mode and honorable mention. Best game mode I've ever played. The only downside is the rewards for completion could be better. Suffice it to say, it's worth a play-through. Maybe Ubisoft will come to their senses one day (unlikely after how badly the Rainbow Six franchise has been...) they could return to their roots and stick with a wonderful game.

Good setup for a post apocalyptic Batman, bad setup for someone with 3 guns, limited ammo, and a backpack full of junk collected along the way.

The Division is a multi-player co-op loot-farming game and as is the case with loot-farming games, it always plays better with others. As of 2017, the PvE and PvP are still broken. It has had minor graphical downgrades since E3, some changes to the gameplay, and over tens of bug fixes, yet it still has a fair amount of game breaking glitches. Every now and then, you'll end up in a match where the mission won't start because the door/gate won't open. This has been there since Day 1 and seems to have gone unnoticed. ""Fun"" glitches include fusing yourself to fuse boxes, portable barriers letting you pass through walls, and falling off the map through solid floors - all in the middle of multi-player PvE sessions. The game had a lot of potential, wasted potential. In fact, The Division excels at the things it does outside of the core gameplay loop. For example, its approach to telling a story through holographic projections and audio files, the graphics on display, and the houses left behind by those who passed away is excellent.

I really tried to like The Division because it looked amazing and seemed to have a lot of potential when it was shown at E3 but, as was the case with Watch Dogs, it turned out to be quite mediocre. If you find repetitiveness and enemy waves addictive, you might like this game.

Every time I fire up a Tom Clancy game, I get a warm tingling sensation at thought of the variety of realistically modeled gunshots provided by an armory of fully-customizable arsenal of every type of gun out there. The Division in particular even wows with the futuristic UI not found in Wildlands, which is great as well. Only half of Manhattan is accessible in this game but it seems mostly accurate from when I was a resident there IRL. Having finished Cyberpunk (a superb artistic achievement in Night City), I think they could've finished the entire island at the very least, since there's no creativity involved. The map is not as open-world as Wildlands, with some streets and areas blocked off by design. And the other four boroughs are pretty much off-limits. However, there's some vertical access both underground and in buildings; subways and sewers are interesting enough. Gameplay and story are balanced and polished to the brand's standard, with the tactical aspect being the primary focus instead of stealth. Looting and crafting are key parts of the game as upgrading weapon power is critical to survival. The usual Ubi multiplayer matching system works well enough for co-op with randoms.

I'll put the bad first for people who are honestly looking to buy this.

The Global Events (monthly updates for new content) are terrible. The game developers decide to make events at the END of the month to make a new ""update"" and give you only a week to complete the challenges. Also good luck trying to finish these events when every single one of them is behind a DLC paywall (even though I have the Season Pass, this is despicable.) These events are usually just filled with cosmetics for your character such as face masks and patches for your jacket. 
(item flexing- not content) 

The whole ""online"" element of this game is awful, get friends to play this with. If you're lucky enough to find others to play with on public matchmaking (after sitting in queues for 25 minutes) you'll be in a team of either 2-3 idiots that can't listen or do anything that isn't their idea- OR be power-carried by 2 people who have possibly showered twice in their entire life and one normal person with a moderate level as you go through the challenging missions. Global Event matchmaking is the absolute worst, people will screw you over to get the things they need then leave you once they got what they want.

Do not- and I'm serious.. Do NOT go to the Darkzone. For the Division, the developers decided to create a PvP zone in the map which has a higher chance of dropping rare / extremely valuable items and loot. This idea itself isn't bad as it allows for a constant playerbase in their servers, however the developers do not even bother maintaining this anymore, so now it is a scum-filled cesspool of hackers and edgy 14 year olds who are allowed to say- whatever they want.

Drug deal takedown, arms deal takedown, repairing satellites and that's the entire game, just do that x10. 

The character creation is really lacking, giving you only 6 ""faces"" to choose from with no way to modify specific parts on your face and rather things you can add on your characters face with piercings or neck tattoos.

I cannot for sure say how the loot drops compare to 8 years ago, but this is definitely updated to be played by someone alone without having to do the harder content, still get the same loot and enjoy the game to the fullest. 

The story is well written, although here and there I missed a bit of the ""Oomf"" effect. This is something that does get better in the next part.

Playing in solo imply almost that you have to play at easy which is most of the time easy. Therefore you may not die to much often. So from my point of view it is just a matter of what are you expecting to have in terms of difficulty to kill the ennemies along the game. 

One great feature of this game is the garments which has been really developed and perfected to a point that you will never see someone in that game walking around and dress like you do. 

On the other hand, compared to Ghost Recon Wild Land they did not use a concept that allows you vastly modify your weapon. Nevertheless there is some room for modification of weapons, but I found the mechanic close to what could be an arcade game. Where any weapons or gears are based on which level you are. 

Anyway to conclude my verdict is that if you fell to play a shooting game think about these facts. You can also go to see some people on youtube that have played the game. Also, be aware that there is not a ton of cinematics and most of them are not containing any trilling scenes.

However, beatting the game can be done quite fast (I would say too fast) and then You are left with PVP. Which from my point of view quite suck since that I never play PVP because my system and my connection are somehow S****y.",1548574747,1650951964,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The streets feel empty and graphically its an older game but the graphics are better and I think people are going to sit down and play it.

Its one of these games that you play and your shocked at how depressing that period of time would be and you wouldn't enjoy playing it at all, Im not feeling like its fantastic emotionally and I wouldn't say its reasonable the way the people are reacting they seem like they need to calm down.

Im finding the difficulty of the game to be harder than normal, I would say its something that is a representation of how easily you can't complete the scenarios.  Is The Division the best Tom Clancy game made in history? It might not be but the maps are the biggest that ive seen them and thats saying alot.  I can't help but think that im tired of the gameplay, im thinking its the age of gaming and about how I feel about it.  I can honestly say im not excited to do the next mission and the story isn't grasping my interest.

 I can say that it isn't detailed enough to be considered an immersive game and thats where gaming crosses the line into reality and people think IMAX films are better so you could say its the screens and VR experiences that are going to change the way we feel about gaming.  Theres not alot of these titles to play so you don't really think of them as an opening for another studio to make another one.

Im level 14 and im playing it less than the day before not because im tired of playing it but because its repetitive.  I wouldn't think that a studio could develop more content and release it without auto mapping cities and having huge data folders of content and thats kind of where game streaming kind of made more sense, is 50-100gb a big enough game for online content anymore? no its probably along the lines of 1000gb.

The difficulty of the game can get quite challenging and its not really that great to play it.  I can't help but think its one of the most difficult things to do and your totally reliant on the cover system and accuracy, noone is able to do this because of the accuracy limitations.

Im almost finished the game with only another few hours left but I don't really feel like playing it.  I think it isn't great and the map exploration is average. 

There are so many things to finish up after the missions that you can keep playing it for a long time and thats probably what people did, its kind of like one of those games you would play when it was released at full price because of the dwindling player base.  The Dark Zone is trying hard and thats probably where it was meant to be played.

Ive got my item gear level up and im finishing encounters but thats all there is to really do unless you want to play the Dark Zone.  Alot of thought put into the game but it feels repetitive.  The Dark Zone is probably the strongest gameplay that you'll see in the game and that kind of limits the amount of players.  Im thinking you see the animations at a more audible volume with The Division 2 but Im not sure why you wouldn't just play something else on steam.  I can't see the Dark Zone being enough content to keep playing it, it isn't.",1648710518,1650178875,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

They also have one person doing damage to them and you have 10 doing much more damage to you. The friendly ai could literally not exist and it wouldnt make a difference, im not sure theyre able to do damage even, and if agro the enemy ai will run directly through them straight to your position even when they cant see you. Its definitely not as fun as division 2 but its decent for like an hour at a time, especially if you never played the second one. The level system is probly the least fun aspect, in this universe where you play a highly trained agent, your former garbage man is still able to kill you with a pistol in a couple shots while you unload an AR into him. Grinding to max level is also not very enjoyable, theres like 5 side mission templates that you do over and over and enemies that are only a level or 2 above you are like twice as strong as you. I wouldnt try to do missions above your level, I'd even do missions below so it feels like you're using a real gun and not a bb gun, although even enemies 5 levels below you are still stronger than you hut you have a better chance. Leveling in shooting games is stupid anyways as it just feels like a bad way to restrict areas and missions and to bloat the loot with the same guns and attachments but this is probably the worst I've played in that regard. If there was a way to boost to max level and bypass the pointless grind and pointless low level loot it would be wayyy more fun. Gadgets also seem pretty useless, the first seeker mine barely does any damage and the turret can be broken in like 3 shots. I wrote this review as I was quitting to hook up my old xbox and play division 2, there is so much more to do and is so much more fun, I wish it was on steam.

Pros: the immersion is top notch. I've never been to NYC, but standing under the Brooklyn Bridge looking up instills a sense of awe that many games never elicit. Also, considering this game was released in 2016, the writers either had done excellent research or they were paid to write predictive programming. I'm going with the later, but it's still weird to look back 6 years and see what they were trying to warn/normalize us about. Also, despite the game being 6 years old, there are this people playing it as of this writing, but you'll probably still have to do most of the grind alone as matchmaking for missions takes forever. I think the people still playing are all endgame.

Negatives: Progress is SLOW. Takes forever to level up, and the gear is exceedingly bland. There are no classes. The agents all have access to the same skills so the ARPG elements feel tacked on. I'm a fan of the Rainbow Six Vegas series of cover-based shooters, but if I wasn't I would not recommend this. Also, the female characters are butt-ugly. Feminist game devs likely to blame. The NPCs look fine, so they must've not given the menial tasks to the diversity hires. Typical.

I played this during the free trial many moons ago and I honestly didn't remember a single thing about it. Not good, but at least I didn't remember hating it. I bought it for 7 dollars and some change and feel it was worth the price of a movie ticket, but not more.

The game truly shines when you have 3 others to form a squad and complete content with a group. That said, the game does not require a group for a majority of the content and there is an abundance of things to explore/complete playing solo. 

Upon reaching maximum level you are presented with daily quests & instances for credits and high end gear. This is eerily similar of the end game of WoW and other mmorpg’s. After looking at other reviews and having experience with end game content in similar games- The Division brings me back for more. For example, you can forgo dailies and prioritize extractions from the Dark Zone, where there is always that uncertainty of betrayal from other agents. 

All in all I would recommend this game. It is something fresh and fun for me. I like the MMO aspects and the story as well as the absolutely beautiful graphics. The major con with The Division is the lack of things to do once you reach the end of the game, and the developers are working to remedy this issue by releasing a steady stream of DLC in only a couple of days. I’m really excited to see what lies in store for the future of this game, as I believe it has a great story & concept, the refreshing new additions to the genre only strengthen this game & I look forward to seeing where the game is after the DLC releases.

In the end, I found it to be fairly competent looter shooter. The cover mechanics are pretty interesting in that they help you navigate from cover to cover fairly well in most cases, though it can be a little ""sticky"" at times. I found myself trying to work with them and use them to my advantage this time around and there is something to be said for it.

The bullet-sponge enemies are a problem but nowhere near as bad as when the game first came out. While the game has character classes and defense/support/offense builds it is somewhat hard to make that aspect stand out in single-player, especially since the game's economy is fairly harsh, both in terms of loot and in terms of money and mission rewards. You will be somewhat at the mercy of your best drop in terms of how you play. If you get lucky you get lucky, if not, I can see how normal drops would be upsetting. That said, the game actually does work fairly well when you stop trying to rush the enemies and, instead, focus on fighting enemies from cover, thinning the herd but not rushing it. When you play the game at the Division's speed and don't try and hurry the fight it really does open up a lot and becomes quite engaging. I found myself enjoying the missions, even the side-missions, because, in a way, the shootouts are crafted reasonably well--given that you play it ""the way the developers 'intended'"" you to play it. The pieces fall into place and it turned out to be quite an enjoyable few hours finishing the game. I thought I'd rush through the last few missions but ended up having a good amount of fun taking on side-missions.",1645847553,1645847553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Everything looks nice and its fun exploring NYC 3 months from now
-Back alleys and roof top climbing. Lots of it, the environment is well done
-Looting and scavenging is fun
-All the feeling of a guerilla and looter shooter that Homefront Revolution only gave a taste of (if you can ignore the grind and bull sh it)
-Sometimes the grind is worth it and you can have a fun time


Cons:
-You can die behind cover because 2 pixels of your hat was showing. 
-If you're playing single player mainly this is much more grueling
-Enemies can 4 shot you but it takes 500 rounds to kill them, and never reload
-GE's like onslaught glitch out so you're ammo types can match and still do no damage
The combat is awful, you're character will decide that instead of running to cover he'll stand or walk around slowly to make it easier to die to, or otherwise run to cover thats where the enemy is who kill you in 2 shots
-ALL THE CONTROLS ARE A SS. YOU CLIMB ONTO COVER AND DIVE INTO GUN FIRE LIKE A RETARD ALL THE FU CKING TIME
-For some reason, and this is how you know there was no actual oversight into the game, they made an apocalypse urban warfare game with a neo bubonic twist, with very few masks, let alone gas masks. It's an item that you don't even see despite being everywhere in the game and really only when you go into contaminated zones and the dark zone which doesn't come till at least level 22
-The most boring faces and clothing, it's NYC and everyone apparently only looted Sports Authority and Holister. Very little clothing options despite again, being an apocalypse game. The bandits and thugs have cooler looks than you
-Your character will purposely jump on top of something just so it can be shot by the boss with low health that you've been fighting for the past hour
-Flame throwers WILL hit you from a mile away, and because FU CK you, they can run and use them at the same time and you can't do jack about it because again, FU CK you
-Any kind of fire at all is a bull sh it insta kill unless it's on your enemies which of course -2 damage at most and that's being kind because you know, how dare you ask for fire or explosives to be effective in a Ubisoft game, what is this a triple A studio or something????
- Manhunt is bs because without a group you're going against medics with endless supply stations, engies with endless turrets, etc 
-Toggle auto vault on at your own risk, whenever your player finds cover or even a fence he'll jump over it, even if it means jumping directly into sniper fire. So many times I try to take cover just for him to randomly decide ""fu ck you Im climbing this bit ch"" and die
-You'll finish a mission, walk outside the area, and get blasted by an enemy boss out of nowhere. You'll die in a mission, respawn aaaaaall the way back at base, walk outside and the game shows it's appreciation with a nice big F U CK YOU by planting a random a ss boss with the lamest sounding name RIGHT IN FRONT of the exit. Oh you're fighting a street boss? Out of nowhere his minions and health fully respawn because FU CK YOU. Street bosses are a pain in the ass. Oh the enemy is chasing you because they one shot your riot shield away somehow? Here, 3 bandits right in the middle so you're trapped because FU CK you.
-You feel a sense of saving people on main missions sometimes, but you rarely get to actually save people because all the enemies already killed them, or they fled and they're now invincible.  Civies hound you for your meager supplies and will curse you out but they'll give you a beanie for your only medkit
-Random one shot kills on you by an enemy, even if they're way lower than you on levels
-Everybody sucks your dick and acts like you're the hero, and all the people on your side say ""we are surprised you weren't a gung ho agent who'd wind up crisped by the cleaners in a week"" which really puts things into perspective. Not that it matters, you don't care about anyone in this game it's so shallow
-The radio guy gets stale fast. It's supposed to be a conspiracy nut AJ type with a New Yorker accent but it just comes off as vague conspiratorial ranting that's been diluted with ""Ey I'm walkin 'ere"" NY attitude and I want to say it comes off well, but he says the same things over and over, it doesn't mix well, like a cheap AJ who's even more scared of naming them. He just becomes more and more annoying each day
-They go through the process of dehumanizing and showing how evil (with cheesy one liners like ""I need to gut me a cop"") the bad guys are, setting women and children on fire, firing at civies, etc, then after you defeat the group, show them all as desperate, wanting to get out, or willing to do the dirty work to get rid of the plague and stop the chaos. 
-The two skeletons holding hands in half life 2 have a more convincing love struggle than (and I had to check for this) Cecilia and Tony. 
-Single player is pushed into multi player but nobody plays the multi player option except in pvp maybe, nobody takes the agency queues so you don't get to make units like you used to when it came out. No clan or guild system so grouping is even more dead. Also you don't see or help any other players unless you're in a group or in PvP
-Cypher fragments become useless once you have literally every clothing in the game which isn't that many, making them a pointless mass reward
-If you have auto-ctrl on, you're character would rather play shoots and ladders with the rappelling equipment (ropes that let you go up and down quicker to access points), then actually go and do the objective. I can't tell you how many times I'd rappel in to stop looters from destroying the equipment, just to have a fight with the rope system as my character would rather go up and down over and over again.
-Another game where you don't have to buy anything because you can either make it or get it while out in the streets looting or helping people. And you're always swapping out old gear with new gear due to levels and whatnot, so have fun updating all your loadouts everytime you get some new equpment
-You got to play through the Uplay launcher which is one of the worst things about it
-No changing your facial looks so whatever you choose in character maker is it
-The worst spawn locations I have ever since in a game
-NPC allies are FU CKING useless. The enemy will ignore them to kill you and they'll stand around letting you get overrun fighting with only a pistol
-Enemies can spawn randomly behind you during a street battle, it's stupid. You'll see 3 enemies, then 4 more spawn behind you who shoot at you, then as you're running while they chase you with flame throwers, 3 OTHER enemies spawn further ahead and shoot you. It's like the game is purposely taunting you
-Enemy grenades will insta kill you without even exploding, they'll just pass you and you'll die. Your grenades, like all Ubisoft games, are no better than water balloons unless they're way under your level. Enemy grenades also  kill you behind a solid wall. They won't even blow up, 
-Survival is full of problems like Stuvyesant having few barrels and shelters and enemies one shotting you. 
-Incursion is just lazy enemy spam
-Turrets are crap
-Survival is garbage in general, you walk around the corner and there could be three gold tier enemies against you with a pistol
-After awhile it turns into boring cqc 1 v 10 boss fights where enemies spawn behind you constantly.
-LMB is sh it enemy + boss spam.40 guys on every corner and base so you can't move around without fighting them all
-Outbreak is a the worst GE out of them all


tl:dr The worst game I have ever played in my entire life, fu ck you Ubisoft. There's no replay value, let alone even wanting to finish it it shits on you so much. Complete garbage.

The environnement is immersive and amazing to look at ! But its playground is virtually empty. I really thought that it would be a more organic world with dynamic stuff happening, and scripted npc you could find here and there with their stories and quest lines. Maybe even choices to make... The Division is NOT an RPG, it is really straight forward, mechanical and bland. The activities are repetitive and fall flat real quick (picking up ""hidden"" collectibles we don't care about, and shooting random squad of scums).
Also you don't get to come across other players while exploring the map. You can only see them in safe headquarters here and there (unless you group up).

The gameplay is just effortless. The game tries so hard to look immersive and realist, but then you engage in a shootout, only to realize enemies are stupid arcade sponges. So out of the place !
And of course AI has aimbot.
There are ""abilities"", but it feels more like a 2015 developpement checklist than real decisions matching the gamedesign.
It's not even fun to kill enemies. The feedbacks are non existent when you hit.

As for the loot and attachment system, well it's not that bad, but the UI is terrible, which makes it all a pain to appreciate eventually. Too many menus to go through, options to mark, mod or compare equipements, buttons to hold etc. Just a non intuitive mess you only want to exit as soon as possible.

Overall, it's nice to take a round in the game for 5-10 hours with maxed out settings. But that's about it.
At least it has its own identity in the openworld genre. Shame they spent more time on props variety than storytelling, gameplay and quests.",1645749560,1645749560,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Game wise, still well made, fundamentally great, and enjoyable to play. Best with coop but great solo as well. The graphics arent much worse than Division 2 either which is a great plus!
 
DZ is mostly dead, and so far, Ive ran into very few people. Ive ran into more griefers and a couple cheaters already which makes it meh.

Two biggest issues i have found with the game as so far, are the super crappy enemy spawns. They are horrid. You will literally clear an entire road, turn, and have enemies spawn almost touching you a fair amount. This makes a COVER based shooter have a core problem of not having cover. If the enemies spawned on a more flanking pattern that would give a proper reactionary time. 

Second issue is locking standard global stuff behind paywalls. Once you have completed the game what do you do? You do the new stuff, new content, global events, and if purchased, the paid content. 

But when item 1 on the global event list is locked behind paid content, its kind of a middle finger. I wont condone that.",1644618973,1645664956,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The reason I won't recommend it is due to the poor performance on PC.

Some say the pressure this game puts on your system is due to memory leaks, but at any rate it seems pretty unfixable which is a shame. I tried the various ""fixes"" like underclocking CPU and deactivating half the CPU cores, but the results are barely noticable. To put it into context, my system reaches higher temps playing Division 1 in low settings than it does playing Red Dead 2 at very high/ultra settings.

But, this game will make you grind to gain loot so, you will enjoy every second of it.

The campaign is very fun to play through (even multiple times), the locations and atmosphere are used creatively and are beautifully designed, and the open world is pretty accurate to real-world NYC. This game is a looter-shooter, and I think the loot is well worth the grind in many cases. The PVE and PVP aspects of this game are strong and intertwine well in the Dark Zone, which is hands down is my favorite interpretation of a high risk high reward environment; it is what I think carried this game so far, and it adds an extensive amount of replayability value. 

The Dark Zone - this lawless area where no rules are applied to anyone, along with being one of the best ways to farm loot in the game, creates a HEAVY incentive to throw unwritten game ethics aside all in the name for better loot. Although I have played this game for so long the DZ still creates amazing highlights and noteworthy moments solely because of player interactions and the PVP experiences alike. Just yesterday my squad and I only planned to do a quick few runs in the DZ to help one of our friends gear up to World Tier 5, and that turned into a multi-hour long session of grinding loot and killing lots of rogues. Although there are other games with these kind of environments - Escape From Tarkov is an example - none come close to the uniqueness of the Dark Zone. The thrill and fear you get by popping a flare and having to defend your ground from other players for 2 excruciatingly long minutes just so you can get out with that one gear piece or exotic you have been grinding so long for, is simply unmatched. Sure, there are ways to avoid players and obtain gear but its only to an extent; there is NO safe place in the Dark Zone. The PVP and the Dark Zone compliment each other and go hand in hand with one another. Many other games have quick encounters that end with whoever can shoot quicker but the PVP in this game can last a little while and is very unique. Obviously gear is important when trying to take down other players, but skill is even more essential. There are many ways to play PVP and there are a lot of opportunities to outplay enemy players and use new strategies, or you can just try and see who can do more damage in a quick face-off 1v1. Besides the core gameplay of PVP being different from other games, its more-so the circumstances of how the Dark Zone works that makes it feel refreshing and fun. Instead of being pitted from team to team or every man for themselves like most games, the Dark Zone has no end goal for PVP; it is just a matter of how long you can last. In a server full of 24 players, it is quite exhilarating trying to see how many people you can take on with your gear and skill, and having a coordinated group of 4 can lead to a long server-wide manhunt on your heads. Or you can be on the other side of the spectrum, trying to kill some server-terrorizing rogues along with every other player right by your side.

There are some critiques I would give to this game. The build diversity is none-existent in late endgame, where classified gearsets are simply the best use for nearly any situation. Although these gearsets lead to better team-play in many gamemodes and creates a player's ultimate farming goal, once you reach that goal, the PVE side of the game becomes very redundant and unrewarding (to be fair, reaching this point takes quite a while). Besides builds themselves being extremely easy to put together, understanding how gear works can be confusing for many new players. I had to explain and go very in-depth to my friends on how certain mechanics work in the game and how loot works in general which is something I think the sequel to this game, The Division 2, did phenomenally well.

For the nearly 3 years (maybe 4 now? can't remember lol) I have played this game on console and PC, I have played it mostly by myself. But I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND grabbing a group of people to play along side you because this game is definitely made to be played with friends. On sale, I would say this game is a must-buy to any person that likes shooters and it is a one of a kind experience (I didn't even talk about the season pass, but 100% buy it if its on sale as well - underground and survival are insanely cool). If people just want a solid PVE experience out of this game, you'll find it, but I would definitely just recommend just picking up The Division 2 (along with the DLC) instead. Even though I don't play this games as much as I used to I always come back to it some time or another and can confidently say that it is one of the best looter-shooters on the market today.",1625093245,1641249491,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,2,True,False,False

-+Forcing player buying loot boxes,Garbage Zone,Normal boxes,Global operations,Phoenix etc. and reward is insane random,you can easy get 4-5 Same Exotic SMGs.
-+Forcing player to grind to Lvl 30 and then ulock a lot better gear to take around 50 hours.

----Dead Zone is garbage with small d**k player killers who kill you 4-5 times without taking your loot:)
-Gun dmg balancing suck a lot,how SMG do same dmg as LMG with longer range???
-----AL have Insane Aimbot,if you blind firing from cover enemy with shotgun hit you on 50 meters,same happend when you trying run from fight,enemy with AK-47 hit you in move all times.
-Builds need rebalance to get better tactical use,tank,medic,support etc.
---Enemy have some sort of shield what player dont have and take a lot of ammo to destroy specially in garbage Hero missions when enemys still spawning and for extra owerkill devs add turrets too:)
-No Rocket/Grenade launchers in game and enemy have really annoying grenade launcher.
---Not friendly if you are alone player or you can try play with randoms and hoping they are good.


Iam sure with removing aimbot,balance guns more and add solo play option it can be a lot better game.

I am playing it through again and the graphics hold up well. The main gameplay loop is repetitive; i.e. go grab this, go help them, go defend this, go fix this, etc. That being said, Ubisoft has done a good job making this gallery/cover-shooter-esque game seem less repetitive with its great looking atmosphere and changing scenery. One minute you're in MSG, then you are in a subway system, and then running down the street, inadvertently shutting car doors and taking bad-boi lives. The game, in my most expert, honest, and truthful opinion, is worth the sale price, including the season pass. 
There is a whole piece of the game that is PvP, but I am only a half-chad gamer and suck at PvP, unless it is CoD:MW2 in the late 2000's, yeeting throwing knives across the map. The multiplayer, from what I hear, went from okay-ish at launch, to a polished and enjoyable treat, unless you go to the Dark Zone solo; that's when you will quickly get corn-holed by 4 min-max brosephs looking to out alpha male your shit. 
Even with the age of the game, and the faults pointed out by more intellectually stable youtuber's, I would still get this game. It has become a Christmas tradition to pop this bad boy on and have a go.

[b] Positives [/b]
[list]
    [*] Gives a nice NYC in Winter during a Virus outbreak with a city in chaos.
    [*] Customization in this game is very good from the guns to even your clothes to make your character unique.
    [*] Single player/Coop to give you the feel of playing as an elite agent.
[/list]

[B] Negatives [/B]
[list]
    [*] The AI in this game is so bad, the enemy shot me through walls and doors at points where I was hiding I would turn the corner they would already be aiming at me shooting.
    [*] You come to NY with the most Useless agent who complains about not being out there the whole time. I expect something more than having an agent that would sit around and complain all the meanwhile saying they did great things. 
    [*] Lastly, this is a personal one I think when you clear a checkpoint in the game it should be taken over by your agents. I cleared one and instantly enemies spawned on top of me *4* of them at that. After being in a long battle than having 4 directly spawn on top of my head its things like that. 


[B]Overall[/B]

[i]This game has alot of [b]Positives[/b] and alot of [b]Negatives[/b] but I love tactical shooters and even though this is not realistic as items can be legendary and such it still feels good the movement and firing mechanics (such as blind firing).

Originally had this on PS4, bought recently for PC and was welcomed with a wave of joyous, loot-snatching-nostalgia. If guns, blurry shooter tactics, spookily echoing pandemic feels and (lots of) fat loot are things you look for in a game: The Division is worth a long and caffeine-fuelled look. 

Game-play is frantic and on the surface, pretty straightforward, but the mechanics offered by the range of weapons, mods, gear and different complete sets of kit will have you scrutinising every percentage point of skill and buff the game has to offer. 

The PVP on offer is some of the most fufilling too. What could be better than defeating another player who has announced their intention of killing as many other players as possible? Getting rewarded for it and then standing over their corpse applauding their toxicity whilst they are forced to watch.

Yes you can enter matchmaking for other missions, but no one will ever join...not even after 18 full hours

tries to be a single and multiplayer game, but going on missions with actual rewards is just waste of time because every boss is made to be not beaten by a singleplayer, no chance

and the darkzone, where epic stuff can be found...
psyche, no bro, top lvl players ask if you want to join for xp, next moment 3 guys on max or almost max activate pvp and you just die in that corner...which makes no sense, what does a lvl 30 do with my lvl8 guns

The main missions are broke up into 3 categories, medical, power, and defense, all of which give you credits to upgrade your home base for the applicable category. The main missions are interesting enough, and they reward you with cool gear and fun bosses to fight, some of them can even be very difficult, but there simply are not enough of them, there are (based on memory) about 12 or 13 of them in the game, and one final mission which is the end of the campaign.

The story is not very interesting, its very simple, and the clear focus is gameplay, which while is good, gets repetitive.

That being said the game does look incredibly, and runs fantastically as well, on a GTX 1080 I was getting over 144 fps on all ultra, and now that I have a 3070 I'm seeing frames in the 300s at times, so this is a very good looking game that is playable on older hardware. The UI of the game is really cool and interesting, I love the hologram look of it all and it is definitely unique to the series.

The side content of the Division is broken up into two categories; side missions, and encounters. Side missions are standard side content, some cool investigations and missing persons, there are some with up to 5 parts so they do give you something to do, however they can be boring at times and can get repetitive in certain instances, however I still found them enjoyable.

Encounters are, in a nutshell, go here, kill these guys, leave. They are incredibly boring, and are basically just to be used to level up, get credits for your base upgrades, and get new gear. I did all of them anyway because I'm a psychopath but if you are playing the game, I would only do these when you want too/ need credits, don't force yourself to play them as they are not that interesting.

Overall, the concept is great but the story is uninteresting, it was fun with friends doing the multiplayer content outside of the story, but I would say if your playing it by yourself, it is best consumed with a good TV show to watch in your second monitor.

That is like 75 cents an hour you pay just to complete the main story and get leveled up. I didn't do the actual math for you out there to correct me, more of a ish measurement. I recommend if you have never played Division to at least play the missions and all the extra things the game has to offer. Lots of open world stuff to do. I played on xbox before coming to pc and starting over. hours are definitely not accurate.

I had this game for the xbox one. over 600 hours it says on achievements. My friends and I decided to come to the pc world and we discussed how would this game be on pc. We didn't buy it till it was on sale. Today we just finished the main story and leveled up to 30. After not playing the campaign for several years and starting completely over again. This game was worth every penny. Co-op is amazing to die and laugh with your friends. It was just as fun as the first time we played it.  Though matchmaking is dead you may play many games solo unless you have some friends to play with. We are going to do all expansion stuff and make our way back to world tier five. player base is low for pvp stuff but the co-op is more than enough for the price for sure. I wish Division 2 continued on this path, it is also a great game. Here is to hoping for Division 3 and some luck to get my classified gear sets back before the manhunts destroy me every second. If you like shooters and co-op with friends and or strangers this game was fantastic and the  story of a pandemic is kinda in par with what the world is facing today. Hope you buy it and have some fun, then go get Division 2, and hopefully wait on 3. Good luck and have some fun.",1638492170,1638492170,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Division improved significantly in the years after its release, and became popular enough that I put in several hundred hours and they even made a sequel.


OLD REVIEW (Now Outdated):

It took me a long time, several days of play time, to come to this conclusion. 

The Division is, in no way, a *bad* game. It is, however, aggressively mediocre. It is forgettable, deeply flawed, and a huge missed opportunity.

The first thing I want to get to is the Dark Zone -- it is, in both practice and concept, a horrible experience. The best gear in the game, ostensibly the goal for most people playing an RPG, is gated behind an experience that relishes having other players steal your hard-earned loot. I literally would have zero problem with this IF there were a way to get that kind of gear elsewhere in PvE, but there is not. The stance of the developers and some fans of ""well nut up and play the game or go away"" on this is simply insulting. Why they would put this DayZ/Rust-style anarchy as the center of endgame is beyond me.

The next big issue: enemy variety. There IS none. I have now played almost 18 hours of this game, and I have encountered FIVE kinds of enemy total: 1) hoodie wearing thug with a pistol, 2) hoodie wearing thug with a baseball bat, 3) cleaner (a faction focused on burning out the infection) with a flamethrower, 4) cleaner with a riot shield, 5) bullet sponge boss. This is absolutely *absurd*, and downright embarassing. EIGHTEEN HOURS in, and I've been killing hundreds of the exact same mob, apparently all named Alex because the line ""THEY GOT/KILLED ALEX"" is chirped ad nauseum by the braindead AI.

Next: the story. PATHETIC. Your character is mute, and thus far in the game (18 hours of play) I've met four main characters, only one of which has had more than ~1 minute of talking time. A doctor, a security chief, a ""quirky"" technician, and a fellow Division agent. Where's this story going? Who knows! What's my driving force to continue? Who knows! It's as if the writers threw their hands in the air and said ""well nobody is playing this game for the story anyway, right?"" -- wrong. For a game that clearly blew so much budget on making a cinematic story experience, it's simply sad how flat on their faces it fell. In all the story missions I've done, there's no exposition except through some radio chatter, you never meet any of the bosses (they all have generic names and tons of HP), etc etc etc

The final nail in the coffin for me is just how mind-numbingly boring it can be to play alone. Matchmaking is only available while in a ""safe house"" hub, where you are sharded with 5-6 other players (most of which are AFK), and even then matchmaking is only available for story missions. If you wanted to explore and do side quests, you would need to try and matchmake under ""Free Roam"", which nobody queues for. So you do most of the side content alone, and you NEED to do side content because the story missions are spaced so far apart in level that you couldn't seamlessly go from one to the next.

I think the true issue behind The Division is that you feel unimportant. You are simply a *drone*. The entire First Wave of agents died or went missing (SPOILER for the first 5 minutes of the game, I'm the worst), and you could go missing too and they would just send more. You get so little money for completing missions and for selling the loot you acquire that you feel like you can't buy anything. It's a 40-ish hour slog (if you play comfortably rather than powergame) to the top, and then you just pull your hair out in frustration over the gimmicks of The Dark Zone.

I hate number rating systems because of how they boil down complex opinions into highly subjective numbers, but if I had to rate this I would give it a 6/10. It's a solid concept, much like Destiny was, but the delivery falls flat in a pitiable way. It needs a *lot* of work, and it needs it yesterday. 


Edit: I feel it's important to be honest and amend my initial review with one fact -- the best gear *is* available outside the Dark Zones. The caveat is that the acquisition rate is absurdly lower. It's no different than a cheap mobile game saying ""oh you can get all the best characters without buying them"", but it's through a 1% drop-rate daily chest. 

Another key distinction: ""it's being worked on [optional: insert ""you fucker""]"" is not a valid defense. I am reviewing the game I paid 60 dollars for, not the one it vaguely promises to be.",1457983122,1637378378,True,0,0,0.697716295719146729,91,True,False,False

I did hear there were initially issues, and a lot of complainers and kiddies crying, but I don't do pvp, I don't care about coop, I am a loner and this game hits every spot. If you like to play solo and like a challenge,  this game is for you.

So much to do, don't let the small amount of the Manhattan map put you off, believe me, it's huge. Story is decent, but not what this game is all about and the developers need supporting and I recommend you buy this game. I was lucky and got it in the sale + season pass with xmas money and it's got to be one of the best games to come out of 2016.

Devs...keep doing what you're doing. I would like to see dlc opening up new parts of Manhattan, Little italy, Central Park etc. I would like to see npc followers too so you can recruit up to 3 npc's to make a squad. It's not unreasonable as the ia isn;t that bad. Also a blood/gore dlc, nothing too showy, but the game really needs some blood spatter, on the walls, cars etc, and a little bleed out on the ground.

The game is really engaging, missions are well designed, AI is pretty smart on higher difficulties, and the game is also very rewarding. There are many different ways to grind for valuable loot in the endgame: dark zone, survival, incursions, main missions, free roam, resistance, and much more. The soundtrack and sound design in general is strong. Visuals still hold up today, and the atmosphere of the game is excellent. The main story and characters are not anything special, but The Division universe is held up by great audio logs and environmental storytelling; allowing the player to come to their own conclusions. Unfortunately, the playerbase has dropped significantly, so it's especially difficult to find players for end game activities. If you have a group of 3 other friends who are willing to play through until the end, I would recommend it, since the game is a co-op shooter at its core. Most of my time spent was solo, so it was definitely frustrating to find people to play outside of special timed events. Play solo at your own risk. I wouldn't recommend purchasing The Division for full price, but if it's on sale, I would absolutely recommend it to people who would like a tactical looter shooter.

Before I begin, I want to say that the gunplay in this game is exceptional. Guns feel good to shoot. Because it's an RPG shooter hybrid, you obviously not going to be able to kill enemies in 1 or 2 hits. It's the tactical elements though that make this RPG shooter more than just a numbers game.  You have to take cover to avoid taking enemy gunfire, you're encouraged to maneuver around covers to flank the enemies, you have to know when your position is exposed and pull back when needed be, et cetera. It works suprisingly well and it almost makes me forget that this is still an RPG at its core, with loot drops and stat changes. 

And yet, even though it's designed to be played as a tactical cover shooter, more often than not, you encounter enemies that don't play by the same rules as you do. You will die over and over because enemies spawn from behind you, one-shotting you in the process. Enemies frequently spam grenades at your position, without any cooldown. The ""elite"" enemies are probably the most BS elements about this game. They're massive bullet sponges, they have infinite ammo, and they are all equipped with cool shiny weapons like a flamethrower or a minigun. You don't get to use these weapons. These enemies also seem have to some sense of self-awareness. It's like they know they're bullet sponges. They don't take cover, they don't flinch when they get shot at, they know their weapons are extremely effective at close range so they will instantly rush your position as soon as they see you. 

The Division should be a good game but it's designed in a way that is extremely frustrating. The kind of frustration that you usually get in competitve multiplayer games when you lose over and over again and you don't get to learn anything from those losses. 

I play games to have fun. The Division is not fun.

+ Game can be playable if you grind side missions and encounters before hopping into main missions.

- Enemies are bullet sponges, if they are 2-3 levels above your level.
- The movement system is disaster.
- Feeling like there's delay when moving.
- The weapon handling/recoil/feeling could be better for a rpg game, should be something like in

The graphics are pretty good and the overall feel of the environment will leave you immersed for sure. As a newcomer to the franchise and to tactical shooters in general I still find myself going in balls deep into enemy territory and dying almost instantly with no backup. I like the idea of needing someone to have your back in order to advance to the mission, and so far, even after countless wipes on missions, I have never seen ONE person rage quitting.

After taking hits for a few release debacles (Silent Hunter, among others), Ubisoft finally hired some real talent and we got games like Rainbow Six Siege, Ghost Recon: Wildlands, Far Cry 4, and finally the Division. The Division is sort of a super polished 'every thing we have learned about punchy cover based shooters).  There will likely be stuff that some don't like.  But there is not a single mode of this game that isn't compelling if you like a punchy shooter.

I paid for this game, multiple fucking times and across multiple platforms.

I basically gave up on this game for the following reasons. 

1) I am maxed out in gear score, got the classifieds i want, and already beat the entire game.

2) I am certain there will be no more updates to this game, if there is more i will gladly come back

3) The dark zone is a very toxic area where players are overpowered and go rogue on low geared players


Now, don't get me wrong when i go on twitch i see people play survival expansion, and the reason to that is because it is balanced in terms to everyone starts out with no gear and work there way up like everyone else, Thus it makes it more fun and more reasonable to play. However, the other expansion ""Underground"" is VERY boring in my opinion, Only thing that is good in the underground is fighting the hunters as you would in survival, But instead of getting survival caches you will be fighting them for classifieds or exotics.

My final verdict for this review which will be the final review i will do for this game since there is nothing really to update besides what i listed, is a 4/10. Mainly because the updates are now over and same for Division 2, And for nothing really to do. OH I ALMOST FORGOT! The one thing i think will bring players back for a week is the global event which mainly you will be trying to grind for classified gear sets.

Once you beat the game you realized that the journey has just begun. I worked so hard to acquire gear and was rewarded. I did stop playing for a while after one of the updates because they nerfed all the gear I worked so hard for but a year later it clearly was for the better. I have returned and many more updates have taken place with tons of new content that was added and from the looks of it there are still a few more updates to go. I was amazed because there are not many games that receive a lot of attention after release. The player base has been at a constant and I wish those who have gotten a wrong impression of the game would give it another shot. I am excited for the future update involving something called the ""The Dead Zone"" as the trailer that I saw looked like they planned to add zombies or infected people. Thank you Massive. 

Pros:

Everything! So much customization and things to do!

Cons: 

The straight journey to get to level 30 if you are trying to rush it may feel a bit repetitive as some of the missions are similar just in different locations. For example the water supply encounters and side missions.",1512393631,1629264852,True,2,0,0.49438062310218811,0,True,False,False

While the game can captivate you with the weather, while the game can mesmerise you with its sunrises and sunsets, it just cant hide the fact after yeah many hours that its just all GAG (guns and grind).
The skirmishes are relatively decent although NPCs in terms of types don't set themselves apart in the level of experience in tactics you would expect them to have. Your own troop NPCs are woefully helpless in a confrontation which is easily proved and laughable considering on occasion one will say they could have handled it themselves and the civilians always seem to manage to escape the carnage unscathed.
If the game had an actual survival element besides dodging bullets it might have been a better offering but as it is, its only fan base will be the usual niche crowd only too happy to spend an eternity drilling holes in things.

Pros:
Graphics look nice
Guns are mostly well done
Sandbox gameplay where you can go where you want in a big city
Interesting setting with real people only and a deadly virus (corona on steroids)
Gameplay is based around a cover system making it look kinda realistic
There's 1 good boss fight

Cons:
Game fails to launch sometimes for long periods of time with the error Delta C 1 200

Post apocalypse with only humans with little enemy variety makes for boring gameplay
Movement is super clunky, takes forever to go around corners while in cover
There's very little multiplayer oriented content
No achievements
Missions are super repetitive, there's around 10 different types
UI is a gigantic mess it makes no sense at all
Forces you to use unity launcher and having an ubisoft account
The game is online only even in single player
You can rarely get stuck on the environment like a chair or a box and only way to fix is fast travel or login again
The MC cannot jump, crouch, lay prone. 
The game tries to sell you DLC at several points and there's a cash shop

However,

It has rubbish health system, over-simplify skills and pretty silly late-game combat. (Which kinda improved in D2, except for the last part, the late-game combat in D2 still a bit silly, but that's FPS RPG genre problem in general.)

D1's campaign is saved by the whole game design, your skills are based on research point, which makes you run around NYC to explore, and if you put your heart into the collectibles and stories (Some excellent VA.), the city become lively to look around. Sadly, those liveliness  end the moment you finish collecting them, ironically still way better than D2. D2 is a grindy, busy city with hollow souls.

The best way to play the game is in a party of duo and clearing mission map only in Hard level during campaign. I always go back to D1 with my friend once in a long while, we took our time slowly on every return with new characters, just chilling through.

Late games are pretty meh. You can play some game modes for gears, but you'll lost interest on the grinds very quickly unless it's your thing.

I recommend everyone to buy this game...

However it is horribly built around needing to be played with teammates even though it makes it seem like it can be played singleplayer all the way through. Unlike most co op games, it doesn't adjust the number of enemies or the difficulty based on how many people are playing. So if you're a lone wolf like myself, the more challenging missions and difficulties in the endgame are nearly impossible and super frustrating. Also often missions just a level or two above your current level are too difficult to complete solo. Overall as an RPG it is terribly balanced in my opinion. In the majority of the game enemies did insane damage, my guns felt like pellet guns (like seriously empyting 25 AR rounds just to kill one enemy??), and possibly the worst thing about this game to me, is how incessantly grindy it is. Like absurdly grindy. I don't feel like going in depth but the grind in this game is tedious, repetitive, and just not very satisfying. If you have a group of friends to play this game with I'm sure it's a whole different experience and much more enjoyable, but don't be tricked like me into thinking this is gonna be a fun game to do solo.

Basically, what im trying to say is that im surprised people still find this game fun after realizing that so much intel that veteran players knew was destroyed and useless. The updates in imo killed this game's spirit causing people to rage more. It still feels the same from console but somewhat more of advantage. I do recommend getting this game but if you're not too much of a lone wolf or just expect a long distance campaign along with the DLCs then don't get it. If you're up for a challenge, have friends who can also get this/can play with then hell yeah buy it and do incur missions after completing the campaign. Incursion missions are a hella of a teamwork and I don't know if its even possible to play alone and complete it, if so, have fun breaking holes into your walls.

This is a post apocalyptic cover based looter shooter. Exploring Manhattan in winter is a joy, punishment for not staying in cover is fair, enemies trying to flank you provides a good challenge, the variety of roles is commendable, and most activities earn you sweet goodies.

Expected faster progress through the story, but story missions are difficult if you're underlevelled and playing solo. Solo difficulty was very enjoyable, but requires respecting the recommended levels. The campaign story is pretty lame, but the story of the city, told through echoes and the smaller stories about the people, highlight the best the medium of video games has to offer.

Where the government caused all of the factions you are fighting, where only your actions are seen as heroic.

Of course you don't think about it because, you're just following orders.

Where survivors trade a fancy weapons for water.

And using excessive force is always the answer instead of talking your way out.

Everybody is balling until someone goes rogue and shoots you in the back with no apologies.

The best games are when you turn off your brain and shoot anyone who shoots back and/or you can read between the lines and find out what the game is trying to say. There is no right or wrong way to recommend this game, all I know is I had a good time.

NOTE

Some of you may not be able to launch the game due to missing Microsoft .dll files. Download and install the Microsoft ""vcredist_x64.exe"" package. If you already have it installed, run the repair option the software allows you to select in order to ensure the required files are installed. Next launch the game via the Steam client and it should launch ""UBISOFT CONNECT"" which will enable you to play the game successfully.

While the regular enemys are tough (when they are the same level as you) and that's a bit of a challenge, there are boss-like enemy's with added yellow or purple bars who are RIDICULOUSLY overpowered.

You lob dozens of sniper rounds in their head, or throw grenade after grenade and barely scratch them... meanwhile they waltz their way slowly  up to you, scratch their balls before wiping you off the face of the planet in 0.6 seconds flat with whatever gun they're holding. 

This is the only thing that sucks BADLY about this game. The missions themselves are quite good and varying in their diversity, and the graphics are quite beautiful but the performance is shaky and dodgy and this is on a Intel 10700K @ 5.1Ghz, ROG Strix 3080 OC.

You might become interested somehow and think that Division 2 would be good and I can attest that it was a true disappointment. I stayed away from the follow up title due to all the bad reviews but the DLC with a return to NYC got me excited. Major letdown. After buying it and playing for a few weeks I actually deleted it. I will NEVER buy another UBISOFT title. JUNK JUNK JUNK. It lacks the story the original game had and was completely unbelievable in it's wokeness , hurricane that destroyed NYC, and a major character turning rogue. Utter Nonsense. The biggest problem with these games is once you have played each mission through you repeat the same mission hundreds of times again scaling up until you finally have weapons that do adequate damage.

It is a enjoyable gameplay experience when it comes to combat and occasionally certain firefights will require coordination with teammates to counter the enemy AI.  Flanking will be useful to catch enemies off guard and get them in a crossfire however the AI can do the same to you.

Most of the ""sidequests"" consist of the same types of tasks repeatedly, such as defending specific points, picking up and moving items from one place to another, protecting certain people, eliminating specific targets, etc.  It gets a bit tedious after a while but you are not required to finish these assignments.

There are also many items scattered throughout the city to collect which unlock special articles of clothing for your character.  Outside of that, haven't seen any other benefit to collecting them outside of learning more about the game world a bit at a time.  Nice to learn more but tedious as well since there are over 300.

The meat of the story comes from the central missions which usually are in unique areas and advance the main plot.  Like the side missions, most of these can be done at the player's leisure.  I tend to enjoy these the most compared to the optional missions as they feel like new areas.

As of this writing, the DLC modes and the Dark Zone have not been tackled yet.  In general, I would recommend this game if you are looking for a collaborative experience with friends.  Story is so-so and the player's character is generic so this game focuses more on multiplayer, coop or otherwise.  If you have voice chat available that will make the firefights an even better experience in working together.

Still to this day, The Division is still a graphically great game, I'm running the game all on High settings and the scenery is just jaw-dropping. I really wish this game had a photo-mode. I'm 5 hours into the game writing this review and for some reason I want to do all the side missions and encounters, something that I rarely do nowadays because in some games it serves no purpose. In this game, it has a purpose so you can upgrade your headquarters. Sure the enemies are bullet spongy but that's what makes this game. If everything was 1 shot kill, then it would have just become another Wildlands or Breakpoint but taking place in New York.

As someone who hates the newer Assassin Creed titles (Origins, Odyssey & Valhalla) for being an RPG title now, I would rather play this MMO-RPG title, a game that's 4 years old than those newer games. And that's very interesting to say since I love the Assassin Creed titles (everything before Syndicate).

I'll be back to update this review after I beat the game.

----

After beating the game, here's my thoughts.

(I'm playing on 'Normal' difficulty)

The Division has 18 main missions. Each district has it's own side missions and encounters that you can gather by going into safe houses along with district bosses that you can defeat. After completing all of the side missions, head back to the safe house to earn a blueprint and XP.

I did most of the side missions and encounters before I started to play the main missions, after that was done I played the main missions and I completed the game in ~ 24 hours and played the last few missions on World Tier 2. To put that into perspective, I completed all the side missions from district levels 5 - 23 and I only had 4 out of the 18 main missions completed. I went to level 25 by just completing each district. Sadly I had to stop at the 24+ districts because I didn't have the Tech wing unlocked so I can't get better weapons to defeat these enemies with Gold health bars.

You can co-op through the entire time or solo the entire time (you just have to be pretty good at the game). I personally did it solo since people in matchmaking are pretty horrible at shooting. With this game not being 1 shot kill like Wildlands, stealth can't be done... sadly so don't try it. I haven't tried out the Dark Zone, I don't think I will. Based on watching other people play it, it's very loot-based where you need to have the best gear and a team before going in. If not, you will lose the fights.

In The Division, you can play however you want, whether it's doing all the side missions first or the main missions first, it's not very linear nor it doesn't hold your hand. If you go under-geared in a higher tier district or Dark Zone, you will get destroyed.

Districts are very repetitive with very similar encounters and side missions, but I don't mind it, though some will dislike the game because of this. Each district adds new scenery which kinda makes it new'ish in a way. As I stated, I enjoyed the game to the point where I did the side missions first (to get the repetitive content out of the way).

The only issue I really have with the game is what whenever I launch the game, it launches in Windowed mode. Pretty annoying, but nothing game breaking. I get fantastic FPS on High settings and I haven't had any server issues.

A lot of people dislike The Division but it's really a great game, I loved every second of it... as you can tell by how many hours I put into it. The Division is definitely a game if FPS gamers that want an MMO-RPG game, they should have this game in their library.

Why I wrote a review after 6 years the game has been released? Because it took me 6 years to finally finish it. Don't get me wrong. This game is great and you don't want to stop playing, but I had other commitments and stuffs and I always made a new character every time I got back into this game, so that's why it took me this long. The one thing that made me think this game is worthwhile is how it tells the story. The story is simple enough but the execution is what made me drawn to it. You gather intels and clues across New York and bit by bit, you connect the pieces to finally know everything that happened inside the city. If you ask me, that's the most satisfying way to find out because it makes you think. It's your choice, agents.",1624108914,1624108914,True,1,0,0.52702707052230835,0,True,False,False

The clothing you can get is really cool as well, and it is one of my favorite parts of the game. There are microstransactions, but not too serious, and it is only for cosmetics (which i think you can get just by playing the game). So the microtransactions aren't that bad, but if you want to blow $40 on them then go ahead and do that. In my personal opinion I think this game is better with friends to play it, but you don't need them to play it.

Now for the bad(ish) parts: Sometimes interiors don't load in immediately, but i don't mind. When you are walking through the entrance of the base you can only walk (which is just something i don't really like, but isn't that big of a deal). And i have heard there are a lot of cheaters but so far i haven't run into any. and  sometimes when I load in I won't be able to move (I use a controller, which might be why this happens), but i just go into my inventory and click around and then exit and it fixes that.

All in all i don't have too many problems with The Division, its a solid cover-shooter/looter-shooter that is awesome and i don't see myself stopping playing any time soon",1624047843,1624047843,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I realize that if someone were to create the Green Poison scenario, humanity would be doomed. I am going to address some of my favorite and least favorite parts of the game.

Tom Clancy's The Division is perfectly represented by the state of New York presented in game; cold, harsh, unforgiving. Don't expect go into the higher difficulties as a lone player and have a good time.

The stories that this game tells through drones, phones, laptops, and echos is without a doubt my favorite part of the game as a whole. So many stories from people doing day to day business to hearing of why SHD agents went rogue. 

How do you make a simple antagonist faction that is also interesting? The Cleaners. I LOVE these guys. To keep it simple, imagine your local garbage men suited up in hazmat suits, put a giant propane tank on their back, grabbed a couple AKs with a flamethrower strapped to them, and set out to burn the virus out of the city. Obnoxious opinion that nobody asked for: Joe Ferro did nothing wrong.

Survival is regarded as the best part of what the Division has to offer, and I agree. There are a lot of people that say it should have been what the base game should have been like, and that is where I have to disagree. While it is fun, Survival is a very challenging experience.

Underground is probably my favorite part of this game, despite mixed opinions. Having randomly generated missions set for you is really cool.

Resistance in the West Side Pier is a very cool idea. Just wish I could have someone to partner up with so I can get past the virus waves.

The one thing I hate most in this game however, are the Riker tank units. I have no idea who in the development team gave this monster the green light. Let's go over it. Explosive bullets? Check. LMG to keep you suppressed while moving towards you? Check. The reload of their LMG is completed instantly? Yep. Their one weak spot can only be destroyed once and doesn't even do that much damage? UH HUH.

I can guarantee that if you pit a Riker tank vs the final boss of the game, the Riker tank will win and kill you afterwards.

Overall, I give this game 3 Riker tanks out of 10.",1623551141,1623551740,True,22,6,0.714588165283203125,0,True,False,False

[b] What I Liked [/b]

I really liked I could play with a pistol and a shield.  I played pretty much the entire game with that set up and made it pretty far.  At least, as far as I wanted.  Plus, the story was engaging since I love games that deal with end of the world type stuff.  There is a decent amount of loot, content, and the graphics are still pretty solid.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

If you don't have anyone to play with, it's a bit of a slog.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

The Division 2 came out.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!

I bought around 2018 when it got a major rework but I never had the opportunity to play it. Some annoying problems persists, none are really game breaking but it can annoy you to the core. Most content works anyway and it deserves attention.

[h1]What impresses me the most may not be relevant to you[/h1]

The art and the story are never the main things that lures you to a multiplayer game, any game that has it should be praised as adventurous and risky for the developers, no wonder why it had a lot of trouble during its release, mainly with cheaters. The realism is impressive, the art direction is pretty. Graphics impresses me, sound FX is okay, story is pretty convincing and the story seems awfully realistic. As you're forced to walk on foot most of NY streets, you see a lot of what I'm saying. I've seen photographers taking pics from the windows, people asking for help or giving advice of where to go, body capture is decent, combat animation is satisfying... 

Sometimes you even forget this is an RPG purely based on DPS, in that regard the game is aging pretty well on that is what I'm saying, charming for its category. There is a curious synth-driven music vibing like the 80s I'm not sure if its just an impression. It is particularly realistic during or 2020 pandemic, makes you think too much about people, how easy it is for them to break down and how fragile it really is. I like the cold snow NY setting better than The Division 2 so I stick more with it than the other one.

Sadly, they never did much variations for that. You can help civilians and they'll reward you, but it's just 2 dimensional. You can't interact much and your character is voiceless like most multiplayer. A lot of other things could have been added, like trying to convince/subdue low level enemies scavenging or something. No, you're just a 2D terminator and that's kinda dull for the setting.

Missions are hard and action packed in such a dynamic way, sometimes they're so epic it even reminds me of games like ME2, even [b]Brandon Keener[/b] voice is on the game as ISAC. Missions are always aiming at the sense of urgency, sometimes surprising, it is awesome this way.


[h1]Is this another lone multiplayer?[/h1]

I haven't found people to co-op with me until I reached level 8 in around 12/15 hours of gameplay, but when I finally did it was just awesome. The combat can be pretty damn hard even if your level matches the hostiles (more on that later) and having someone to flow it with you is fairly needed. Made some friends and soon we were creating strategies that the squad (4 max) agreed in cooperating, then we were experiencing the true The Division I heard about these years. Fun is quite endless when you see the result of your strategy at the best of everyone's abilities - sadly it won't last this way.

Do not get your hopes too high because the lasting community in the chat is always slow and dumb and I think I was kinda lucky. It may take you some time for someone to respond your pleas, to find viable individuals on the same situation than you, specially low level and willing to play along. If you find high level players you're doomed to suffer, you'd be thinking that it will be good for you but the enemies level are based on the highest on your team, killing your fun-factor.

You do well to hunt some noobs on Discord groups before embarking, if not, just go alone and take your shot. It is totally doable, for I still find myself going solo from time to time. You can interact and see others in social areas, but there is no way to interact with other players when you're free roaming - unless you go to DZ. Free roam should totally be up to the open world itself, but it isnt, Dark Zones attempts to do that but at the cost of PvP conflicts ""rogue agents"" I don't recommended in early game. So this way we could bump into each other more often and join the fight. You have a nice organized GUI (the easiest to use I have seen) but the chat is mostly filled with fools and spammers, blocking them does little help preventing it. 

[b]Edited: cheaters[/b] Still are present in the game for 5 years straight. It has gotten better but also hopeless to get clear of those. Matchmaking balance sucks too so its harder to find fun, I wouldn't even bother trying.

[h1]The grinding and the rewards can be punishing[/h1] 

The Division levels up very quickly - your weapons and gear gets outdated fast as a result, when you think you're hitting the spot, nah, it will be over soon. So you can't avoid constant upgrading through the repetition of missions. What you can possibly avoid however, is the Dark Zone, thankfully. DZ is either filled with cheaters or low/high levels, but you can always try to team up to discourage solo bullies. The loot will be random but persistence may actually be rewarding but it is HARD as fakk. Replaying missions on hard-mode is literally Dark Souls with guns meaning you will die a kabillion times no matter how good you perform.

My way to get through that from early levels was to just do side missions and encounters - mostly alone. Eventually, even enemies level 8 were beating me up which meant I was doing something wrong. You NEED the best to keep going, abilities ready and gear always a step ahead. That's no option, it is quite mandatory. You either fall your ass or get ready for a beating. Or worse. You can take like half an hour just to kill 4 hostiles.

On early game, weapons are mostly repetitive, armor barely resembles anything new because they just change the color most of the time when you swap it. Once I could reach level 30 then things started to get interesting. Not just visually, like hardcore tactical veterans like a Tom Clancy's driven blockbuster - even the music and the expansions seems to mutate when you reach 30+ end-game. The end game ""ends"" abruptly. The farming is not rewarding after score 280+ and you may abandon the game there.

Character creation sucks really hard, (its better on Division 2) just so you can buy something. It isn't expensive but that's not very fair if you have paid for the game already. Some stuff can drop in the world but they're of course extremely rare so don't expect that to happen much. You can gamble, but it isn't straight with money, there is a intermediary called ''encrypted keys'' or random vanity items (no kidding, that's how its called) just to make it look less blatant. No wonder why looter shooter is failing world-wide.

[h1]The combat[/h1]

A.I. is smart no matter the approach. Sometimes intrusive, sometimes dumb, aggressive, intelligent, suicidal, you name it, they're doing it. Some random criminal can be slow and rage driven, but they don't sound nor move the same when you're fighting militia and terrorists. Sometimes they're so good at fighting, your best strategy just won't work and you need to go Rambo like they often do. This is arguably, the hardest gun firing games I have ever played, sometimes it is downright unfair and why not, even a little cheap-stupid.

Moving around looks realistic but sometimes it is just incredibly stupid. I saw countless times vanishing cover commands not showing up, nor to climb, because that particular place looked like you could cover but the system or the codes were missing there. That's incredible stupid and I just don't like the clunky controls sometimes, it gets on my damn nerves. It is beyond belief the devs never fixed it.

Sure, there is a lot of Ubisoft related nonsense and there were big problems on launch - but this game got so much support in following years it is essentially in the same zone as No Man's Sky.

That game is great, amazing graphics (especially for the time it was released, if only Ubi didn't shoot themselves in the foot with E3 overhype lies it would be considered a work of art). It's gritty, very dark, very real. Even solo playing is great, you can disregard the multiplayer and enjoy this game alone including endgame (apart from things that obviously need a team, but a LOT of the endgame is soloable).

Game world feels real, sure it is a game not a city simulation but this is the BEST depiction of real life place that feels most realistic in the ENTIRE gaming history.

Gameplay is fun and there is a lot to it, it''s not shallow at all there are things to figure out, discover and experiment for hundreds of hours.

If games released today would be as good as this old game is NOW, we would be giving them 10/10 and praise how well they are made. LOOKING AT YOU ELITE: ODYSSEY you garbage joke of a release.

On this regard- the game would randomly just quit to desktop after around 1-2 hours of playing AND it would always max out my CPU and GPU. Which, honestly can't be justified. (Ryzen 5800X + RTX 3060), the game would use 60%+ of the CPU even when doing absolutely nothing. Overheating like Hell

It is a fun story to play through and you get plenty of exploration, however it seems to me that most of the time you are just doing the same thing. You get players on lower levels popping up a bit in a few areas and higher levels in the safe zones, but you never actually see them in places like the Dark Zone, which is really unfortunate as that is pretty much one of the most fun parts of the game. **Previously in (around about) 2019, there was plenty of experiences that you could get into when playing the game, there was a lot of people hanging around and willing to do missions and even hang out.

As for my personal rating, i'd give it a 7/10, mostly because the exploration and missions are interesting to roam through, that including the collectables.

If you like exploration and just generally going through the game it may be good for you! On the other hand, if you wish to do it for the multiplayer experience of going into the PvP areas and finding people out there, it may not be such a bright idea due to the dying community.

I did actually like the singleplayer styled experience and adventuring throughout the story though, and to be honest, that is pretty much what this game is nowadays.",1622413709,1622413709,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good stuff:
- Really addictive third person looter shooter set in a devastated New York city.
- Stupidly detailed world to run around and explore, the devs did an amazing job, every street, building and apartment has so much detail and physics objects you can shoot, it's crazy really. Just stop and look around the locations the fidelity of the graphics is pretty stunning, Light shafts shining through smoke and glass shattering realistically.
- Intense gun fights where you'll have to retreat and take cover behind cars while sparks and partical effects are flying everywhere with loud gun sounds which echo around the streets,
- Smooth, high quality character animations and lots of character customisation.
- Lots to do and unlock, there's always a reason to keep playing if you like the gameplay.
- Play alone or with a group, it's really cool to take part in huge PVE gun fights with other people and everyone gets the same rewards,
- The end game is where it's at. Once you reach level 30 you will start unlocking the best gear in the game which is way more powerful than the guns and armour you'll find at low levels. Guns with unique perks and armour sets wtih abilities and buffs which stack to make you pretty unstoppable.
- The dark zone is the PVP area of the game where you will find powerful loot which other players can kill you for and you can kill them but it's actually more beneficial to work together. That doesn't stop some players though, it can get pretty tense.


The not so good stuff:
- Repetitive to the extreme, all you do is run to a location and shoot stuff but i enjoy that, some people might not.
- Before level 30 you will find only garbage gear but it is sort of an MMO so that's to be expected.
- Some missions are REALLY HARD alone. Enemies can be bullet sponges whereas they will shread your health with a few hits. Don't go into a mission under levelled, not even one level under because you will have a bad time.
- I also have the game on PS4 and the expansions are kind of crap and not many people play them. I don't know what it's like on PC but i won't be buying them on PC.

Also, the amount of hours posted does not reflect actual hours played. I owned this game through uPlay before migrating to Steam.

Now, the actual long part:

Surprisingly enough, the PvE is plenty fun and challenging enough, for a while. Typical copy/paste fetch quests, area defense, and assassination targets. The forgettable story is crappily stapled on to the endless grind to reach level 30. After that, there are plenty challenging daily missions and other repeat missions for higher quality loot, which is all fine and dandy until you decide that it's not enough.

Then you go to the Dark Zone, or DZ for short. DZ is the part where they royally messed up. The DZ has it's own currency, it's own ranking system, and it's own rules. To start off, the DZ has it's own ranking system separate from single player. The level cap is much higher, and the quality of loot increases with each level. The trick is, you have to visit the DZ every few single player levels to rank up your DZ rank so you aren't completely out-geared and out-matched by the time you hit rank 30 outside the DZ. Not fun, and not well thought out. Especially considering if you die in the DZ, you lose a few DZ levels.

Second is the currency. Forget all that money you've been earning through your single player experience. DZ only takes DZ credits in exchange for getting DZ quality gear. Only way to get DZ credits is by slaying mobs in the DZ. Should you find yourself dead in the DZ, you lose a portion of your DZ credits, far more than you'd earn in a simple run through the fastest mob routes. So profit is tough, especially if you're under-leveled. Don't let that get you down, because if you want high quality gear without the DZ, there's always the dailies and weeklies you can beat to earn yet ANOTHER type of currency to use back at the home base. But not to buy good weapons, just the blueprints. You gotta craft the weapons, and hope you get the stats and skills you want on it.

Now for the grand scheme. Take the levels, the currency, and add in PvP. PvP is possible in the DZ, but you get ""punished"" for doing so. Killing players or stealing loot will mark you as a rogue agent for a short duration, will put a bounty on your head, and make you visible to all other players in your vicinity. If you can live through the timer, you get the bounty, if you get killed, your killer gets the bounty. The more players you kill in a short span, the higher the bounty and the longer the timer. Pretty fun and fair for all. Except, it's not. Thanks to a near-non-existant anti-cheat system, the DZ is rife with players using hacks and exploits to simply ruin other's days. Mix that in with trying to earn DZ levels and DZ credits, and your in for a lot of profit loss.

The worst part, after all of that, is Ubisoft doesn't care. Not like it's anything new, but this really takes the cake. Ubisoft, deaf to the aguish and cries of the users, continues on it's merry little path of getting out all it's ""Year One"" content. Patches, bug fixes, adding in new missions, new currencies that we can't keep track of, new gear, guns, and much, much more, and yet, no anti-cheat. No help for those who thought this game was a much needed change from the pace of rinse-and-repeat First Person Shooters. I can only pray they don't let For Honor fall into the same pit of despair that they have The Division.

(P.S. Hey, Ubisoft, if you're reading this, you should add BattlEye to The Division like you did Siege. It's kinda helping.)",1473213969,1620585393,False,144,3,0.799531161785125732,0,True,False,False

The Story, back in the early 2000's the U.S. Government ran a simulation of what would happen if the U.S. underwent a biological terror attack. Operation Dark Winter as it was called pretty much showed that well... We'd be pretty screwed. Note I am not going to point at 2020's Covid-19 pandemic that's still on going as of now in 2021. But yeah what they found wasn't pretty. Now over in the Tom Clancy universe this lead the Government to start up a covert group of men and women who in the event of a major attack that could pretty much screw everyone over. In 2015 in the Tom Clancy world on Black Friday a major epidemic breaks out world wide sweeping into just about every major city in the world. Due to this the Government activates those sleeper agents who are part of the Strategic Homeland Division or just 'The Division' to assist emergency responders.

Needless to say the first wave of agents? It didn't go all that well thus you being a second wave agent show up in New York City to find out what the hell is going on.

Alright so gameplay, The Division is a third person cover based RPG looter shooter. Thus combat is for the most part getting behind something and popping out at whatever the hell wants to murder you in NYC. You have three stats in the game, Firearms that up your damage with guns. Stamina your general 'health' and the like. And finally Electronics that will let you do more damage with your skills, heal more with them, last longer, so on. Being a Division Agent you have a number of skills that you can use, everything from Pulse that will let you see enemies around you, Support Stations that can heal over time, Turrets that will attack enemies in range. A Shield that blocks anything firing at you. And note those can be upgraded so if you want the Turret acting as a Flamethrower? Yeah that's a thing.

Really you'll learn the basic gameplay stuff while you go from level 1 to 30. So lets talk the real meat of The Division the end game. When you reach the end game you'll be in 'World Tier 1' and will start to find all sorts of new items to play with from Gear Sets to Exotic Items. When you gather up items you can move yourself to World Tier 2. You have 5 World Tiers with the last being the 'end game' world tier.

You have a number of missions that you can do a repeat with a top 'Legendary' mission mode. You can farm world bosses for loot and they respawn every few hours. High Value Targets that you can pick up and hunt down. Small 'raid' like content called Incursions that have to be done in a group of four. And I should note, Division 1 doesn't have anything 'blocked' behind a content wall. You are not going to have to do an Incursion to get a Gear Set or an exotic item like an Urban MDR. Doing that content will give you more item drops and better chances to get those items. You also have West Side Pier as well, an end game area that offers up a horde mode that has you facing enemies from all of the factions. Still play it however you want, casual, solo, group, everyone can get the same stuff just the harder content gets you everything faster.

There's also the Dark Zone. This is Division's PvEvP area, the idea is it's an area of the City that was walled off and is in general lawless. The DZ has a higher chance of finding good gear, however you have to call in a Chopper to extract any gear you find. Also your fellow Agents can (and will) turn Rogue. This means they can turn around and kill you in order to take your stuff. If you don't like random PvP? Best stay out.

Division 1 also has three DLC game modes. Last Stand is a team based PvEvP mode that has two teams fighting in an area of the Dark Zone. Underground is somewhat rogue like, you'll take missions that will send you into NYC's underground areas and as you do more? You can take modifiers that can change things up somewhat. Finally there's Survival, a game mode that has you leaving all of your uber gear behind as you take a Chopper that into the DZ to find antivirals, that ends up crash landing with you being injured and slowly dying of blood poisoning. Also there's a blizzard moving into the city as well. Thus your goal is to find gear, crafting mats, warm clothing, meds, and make your way to the DZ to find those antivirals and get out before you die. Only you'll also be dealing with the enemy factions and a new group called Hunters who are hunting down Division agents and using the same tools you are using. Also if you are playing on PvP mode? Well it turns into a semi-battle royal as your fellow agents can (and will) be trying to kill you.

I could add in a lot more but well I think the question is do I recommend Division 1. And yes I do, more so when the game is on sale and you can pick it up with all of the DLC. Yeah it doesn't have the player base that it once had as most people moved onto Division 2. However the game is still rather fun, the fact that you can play solo and nothing is locked behind a content wall is a nice bonus.

as a legendary eagle in csgo, I am no newbie in shooting games. And I usually complete games on hard difficulty.
But this is the ONLY game so far that has me stuck in countless death loops under just NORMAL difficulty.
The AI is bad, plenty of enemy types don't dodge or hide, all they do is rush to your face and kill you with one shot. It is more tedious that they are pure bullet sponge. Imagine shooting at them for 2-3 mags and nothing happens.
The graphics ain't bad, but it has bad textures so it gives away a weird but strong plastic feeling. The story is meh. The difficulty is harder than an Asian math exam.

TLTR: 
This game can keep you busy the same way as if someone spilled coffee on your shirt and now you spend rest of your day doing laundry. Everything is designed to grind and waste your time. Kind of fun with friends but there are definitely better options out there. 

CONS: 
1. Everything is level gated to hell, fighting higher leveled enemy is almost impossible as they kill you in 0.5 seconds, forcing you to grind over and over in the same area before you can move on. 
2. Missions are boring and repetitive, go here -> fight wave -> collect data/rescue person -> fight a boss that takes about 1000 bullets. Even the ""Story"" missions are not much beyond this. 
3. Boss/mini boss are nothing but aimbot bullet sponges, they all have the same pattern: shoot -> grenade -> shoot -> reload, making it a marry go round wack a mole, and you are the mole. 
4. AI is brain dead, especially friendly AI, they don't trigger when enemies are 30 metters away, they can't hit anything and do about 0 damage. Enemy AI can hit you with a shotgun across the map through a window. 
5. Map is quite empty, no cool npc you can meet, no dialogue, nothing. No dynamic. All apartments are empty, Civilian have the same behavior. No memorable location or people, waste of NewYork City. All story delivered through generic audiolog that sounds like they used a story generator. 
6. Guns feel the same, no big difference between an AR or AK or even a mp5. 
7. The cosmetic selection is a joke, you get flooded with junk that looks the same, not even the stuff you pay for is interesting. 
8. crafting is grindy, so I need 10 green parts to make a blue part and 10 blue part to make a purple part and 20 purple part to make a gun that doesn't suck? No thanks. I have played 30 hours and only have 1/8 credits to level up one pistol, go figure. 
9. Dark zone enemies are all tanky as the mini bosses, best part, they spawn behind you and two shots you since you dont have cover. making solo impossible. 
10. Other less boring gamemode locked behind DLC and level 30 requirement, which takes you probably 40 hours to reach, no thanks.  



PRO:
1. The weather change is cool (although fog makes it impossible to see enemy but they don't get effected) 
2. More fun with friends but that can also be said about using the toilet.

The Division is an open-world looter-shooter set in the world written by Tom Clancy. When I first gave it a try, it seemed like Ubisoft had managed to pump out yet another generic and forgettable game that will quickly fade out. I was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong and as I got deeper into the game's mechanics, I was hooked. The Division certainly isn't a masterpiece or even one of the greatest games ever made and the story is quite disappointing, however, it does what it set out to do pretty well and although it does get repetitive over time, its still worth a try.

+ Graphics and effects
+ Level design
+ Good loot with nice variety
+ Setting inspired by Tom Clancy
+ Length
+ Satisfying endgame
+ Additional content
+ Shooting - the feeling, the feedback and ragdolling of enemies is great
+ Weapon variety 
+ Social features are unobtrusive if you are a solo player, yet do provide nice change of playstyle
+ Collectibles

Gun play itself is fine, but enemies as early as 3 hours into this game who's story is rated at 23 hours long are spongey and take like 2 and a half mags for one guy, on a weapon that's rated at 1500 damage. Every mission has like 3 waves of 12 enemies of that difficulty, and those are the basic enemies. Then there's the purple enemies and the yellow enemies. My 2 buddies and I are at least aight gamers and the mission in the mall took us 5 tries. 
     Gameplay itself seems padded by constant run ins with random enemies, the large waves of spongey-ass hostiles and if you have a mission where you have to transport components your movement is slowed to about an eighth of your normal walking speed. That on top of the fact that the movement in this game isnt very great to begin with and you're in a world of ""fun.""
     You can take cover in this game, which you'll need to do a lot cause enemies with weapons that are rated as weaker than yours take your health down by half in one shot. You go to use that weapon? Frozen peas. When you go to cover, sometimes your character runs out in the open and ""hides"" behind a pillar while STARING at the enemies. it's inconsistent, sluggish and just straight bad.
     Also, the menus in this game are atrocious. They're complicated, difficult to traverse but hey, they look futuristic right?! This game seems to have taken everything people who play games hate about action games and put it into one: bad UI, sluggish, inconsistent movement, spongey enemies that take forever to kill and a forced-feeling difficulty, and the almost necessity to have friends to do anything, even then it being overly hard. Basically, this game is only difficult because it takes a long timed to do anything.
     There are several good things though, the graphics, sound, and characters are all decent. The story... exists but is kinda confusing early game. Characters are fleshed out well and I definitely enjoyed some of the interactions. Gunplay itself is actually ok, minus the fact that in order to use a scope you need a higher magnification, as 1x scopes are also OTS or Over The Shoulder and there is no option for first person. However the looting is tiring and kind of confusing in itself, and the overall experience between me and my buddies was ""wow what a well designed game, I'm having a lot of fun"" that obviously being sarcasm.

Pro:
The story is nice, a setting where you are like the last hope for the country to keep ahold of its self somewhat after a virus outbreak. The look of the city is damn nice, the characters are enjoyable. Everything storywise is nice. But this ain't a visual novel, its a shooter rpg. Therefore next...
The idea of a 3rd person shooter rpg with this concept is nice, the skills can be useful(clearly, looking at you riot shield)
The co-op is alright, the pvp skirmish is cool, the idea of the Dark Zone as well.

By now you may notice a theme here, ideas, the concept. The division has a great concept... Now its time for the execution... where it all falls apart.
Con:
The execution. Whenever its trying to get to cover, dealing with Ai/players, damage output, loot and more, you'll find that the division may leave you lacking the tools to survive in certain situations. Of course you got your skills, but how does using a 1st aid on overdose to what i call extra health and running at least 1 second to cover and losing your extra health and almost half/half of your health.  A medkit will heal you fully, if you don't get hit. What happens when you have no med kits and skills on recharge? You use your wits and brain, but this game will do whatever it takes to make you suffer for some reason, it's breaks it own rules just cause, you will often have things come out wrong, whether it's trying to roll but instead go to cover, trying to insta a skill with a double tap but only a single tap is registered.  When you fully reload, but need to roll to save your skin it takes that reload away even though the magazine is shown full. 
The health is a joke, the AI is a pain, an elite can wail on you faster than a group of vets no joke.
And PVP is an unbalanced mess, especially in the endgame, you can get wreck very easily while your opponent barely feels it. And then there's the looting, it comes to a point where it feels like you do too much and get little to nothing to show for it. You may grind for hours/days/WEEKS/ god forbid month/s to get the gear you're looking for. One would say go to the DZ, oh yeah let me go in there with all those annoying rogues with hacks, in groups too. Which brings me to this point.

Remember the coop? Yeah playing this game, it seems like that would be the idea for the best way to play it. Don't get me wrong things can be fun in a group, but not everyone wants to play together some want to play by themselves. And this poses a problem for incursions, Legendary missions... Cause those are surrounded on team play and that brings a problem for those who can't find people to play with or can't play with anyone(this is for console players due to requiring online subscription). 

So imma sum this up for everyone here, I don't recommend the division because the execution is not good, the AI is a pain, the PVP is unbalanced, the looting is grind that can be so tiring, the feel for a need of coop instead of playing solo takes away from the experience. The division has a good concept but how they went about it is just not good. Everyone has their own experiences and may have different opinions.

I do plan to update this later. So it may change.",1617916294,1617916294,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The single-player mode was immersive, I believed in the story. The world, the city, the weather, the darkness, and scheming nature of the environment, it all gripped me. The Dark Zone was entertaining. Playing cat and mouse really was a thrill. As each meta developed it was a grind to stay ahead of it. I really miss this game and the style and story writing.

Worst map design bunch of cars all over the place this game forces you to play all the time in cover which sucks you cant take different positions there is no mobility to character level design is really poor i wish there should be more space around to move but nope its hard to stay in combat & survive.I won't recommend this trash division 2 is slightly better version than this game but both games sucks to be honest.

I wanted this game so hard since the release date but unluckily the price was too high for my poor wallet.
Now that I've got it I can say that these 10€ I spent to buy The Division are one of the best money I've ever spent.
[b]The Division is an RPG Third Person Shooter, with looting and covering systems, where you are an agent of the ""Division"" who has been sent to New York after an Outbreak exploded during the Black Friday to help people and to free NYC from bandits, scavengers, killers of various genres. [/b]
There is a ""long"" story to play alone, with friends or with strangers (I suggest you to start alone but then to play with someone else because missions get gradually harder), and an online mode called ""Dark Zone"" which is PvE, but even and far more PvP, where you have to find a better equipment and then extract it to proceed in the story or other DLCs. Other players can try to kill you to steal your equipment. The Story Mode and Dark Zone are included in the base game. 
The Season Pass includes:
[b][h1]--> The Survival DLC[/h1]A particular Battle Royale gamemode where you start with nothing and a 1hour countdown which means you have to survive otherwise you'll die, finding a better equipment, proceeding to the Dark Zone and then extracting it (even if you find a good equipment and then you die, you'll be able to transfer it to the story mode.)
[h1]--> The Underground DLC[/h1]Where you can explore NYC's underground to loot better equipments, and join Raids.
[h1]--> The Last Stand DLC[/h1]Which is a new Dark Zone gamemode where you have to conquer and to defend objectives (max 16players) to get a better equipment.[/b]

[b]The game has got quite many gamemodes to be defined ""long-lived"", it can bring you hours of fun especially with random dudes or friends. I think it's worth a try.[/b]

[b]SUMMARY[/b]

STORY: 8/10
GAMEPLAY: 9,25/10
GRAPHICS: 10/10 - One of the best I've ever seen, even if it had a massive downgrade from E3 2013 trailer.
OPTIMIZATION: 8,5/10
AI: 8,5/10 - Not bad, enemies are sometimes hard to beat even at Normal difficulty.
LONGEVITY: 8,5/10
GAMEMODES: 8/10 - There are only 2 main gamemodes with the base game..and some other modes unlocked after the end-game. Even if Dark Zone, Legendary Missions and Raids can all be long or short depending on if the player likes them or not, i think the full experience of this game can be ""tasted"" only with the Gold Edition. That's why i give it an 8 and not a 9.

The physics and hitpoints are great, the atmosphere works very well, and you will have at least 40-60 hours of fun here.

The only downside are the hackers - thankfully there are less of them now, but in the Dark Zone - they always happen. Which is unfortunate because you have a higher drop rate for some of the more rare items and materials. That is not really the fault of the developers - more a fault of the publisher to not implement anti-cheat tools. (I mean c'mon, just pay for that, Ubisoft...)

On the whole: A great PvE experience - especially with friends.

The four elements of the environment; winter, the holidays, urban streets and post crisis city mix great together and create a distinct tone to the world.

The other thing the game does very well is the cover shooting gameplay itself. The way the shooting feels, the way the cover mechanics function are all extremely well honed. It handles great and it plays great, in general being very satisfying and it feels complete.


The general structure of the game is a pretty typical waster, lots of pointless fetch quests, collectables and there really are no actual dynamic missions or gameplay it is all just fight your way through the instance until you win. The skill and class system is bare bones and feels totally unfinished, while the game has little actual mechanics or features to the combat beyond the actual shooting itself. There is no real melee system, no dynamic system for the player interacting with the environments, or anything else at all.

The movement is not really tight enough for the player to be able to properly weave through the environment in an emergency, which the game will put the player in, so the player just has to fumble around and hope they do not die if that happens. The dodge button and cover button are the same, yet they are polar functions, so that also makes it difficult to function in critical situations. Your singleplayer world will lag if you do not have a good connection to the servers. In the later areas enemy groups are put so close together in the world that often they will trigger each other even if the player is doing a mission. So the player will get swarmed and camped by enemies they have no idea were nearby because they got pulled in by the mobs being put too close together. Which just means, trial and error learning the enemy locations in order to compensate for them swarming.


From start to finish, all this game is about is just shooting at enemies. Which would normally be awful, if the shooting was not as good as it is here. Even though this honestly is a shell of what a real game should be, the great shooting combined with the fantastic environments actually makes it worth playing in the end.

But not for full price, at all, the on sale price is generally what this game is worth. And even then, it is only worth that price from the combined value of the triple A graphics and the shooter gameplay. 

As a concept this game is still a triple A game, which means it is designed to waste the players time as much as possible and bait them into spending cash on micro transactions and gambling boxes. But unlike other triple A games at least it does some things right, but only two things right.",1528361225,1615973749,True,28,4,0.657751023769378662,0,True,False,False

The game is a 8.5/10 until you play the Dark Zone; Where you battle real players and it falls to a 6.5/10.

I am beginning to hate this game due to the rouge players, and that's where the problem sets.

This game has hackers, and losers who take advantage of the rouge position.

So, picture yourself in a typical FPS or TPS game, and you are grouped up with four other friends.  
You guys are running around, dodging bullets, and holding cover, just to grab a bit of fancy loot.
After acquiring the loot, you head for the chopper to make your escape.
Ahead of you, a guy with an equal or less level starts shooting at you.
So, all five of you shoot back.
Yet, somehow, all five of you get deleted and the enemy runs off with 50% health.
All your loot is taken by the rouge player, and your left smashing your keyboard.
After this, and for the next hour, the same thing keeps happening to you, your friends, and other players. 

Eventually, you will hit the world 5 Dark Zone (There are 5 levels of the world: Newbies, Specials, Core, Grinders, and finally Tryhards). At the final tier, all players are thrown into the same map. This means, you could be lvl. 40 and get stomped by a lvl. 94 every day. Which is exactly what happens.

Full stop- the graphics and attention to detail is actually stunning. Like, I wouldn’t expect it from Ubisoft, but it actually doesn’t feel like the world is mostly copy pasted and boring. It’s much more dynamic, with marvelous graphics to supplement. I think the Snowflake engine was actually a big boon here. 

The gameplay itself is fun. It’s mostly tactical/cover 3rd person gun combat mixed with using specialized skills. It can really range in difficulty though, from having an easy single player time, to highly coordinated multiplayer encounters. 

This game really has a lot to offer, the looting pace is really fun, and character armor/weapon/cosmetic customization is enjoyable.

Ultimately, I'm going to lean more towards the first game as it plays somewhat superior to the second game, not mechanically so much, but in a way that makes the gameplay loop satisfying and replayable. 

While the missions aren't as cinematic, long, or as diverse as the Division 2's, they're still pretty good and I like them for what they're worth. They're very grounded and not over the top with action packed sets or ludicrous stories. I'm not going to say they're better in pretty much any aspect but I did enjoy them enough. They're all pretty replayable which is nice because in Div2, you either loved a mission or you hated it. For example, I HATED the presidential bunker mission because it dragged on forever and was pretty boring but I loved the American History Museum because it was fun. In Div1, the missions were mostly average but likeable. 

So the Dark Zone in this game is far superior to the ones in the second game. For whatever reason, Massive opted for 3 separate and compressed Dark Zones for what I can only imagine was to force more PvP encounters. This absolutely sucked because you could fast travel to different checkpoints to quickly catch up and not to mention that they have 3 evac area (started with 2) which meant you were almost always being stalked which made getting farmed items a bitch. At least in this one, you could take routes to purposely avoid conflict and sneak your stuff away mostly unbothered. Don't know why they decided to make the Dark Zone in Div2 a mostly PvP affair. It's also what basically killed balance in the second game as in Div1, your build was as strong as you made it. In the Div2, they balanced the PvP so much that it ultimately destroyed the game as exotics were getting nerfed and sets made useless so your builds were gambles as to whether or not they'd be nerfed. I had a super seeker build for PvE that got utterly destroyed and made all my effort for that build worthless. Also, I liked the feel of the massive Dark Zone in Div1 a whole lot more, it felt like this abandoned hell that was just overtaken, the ones in Div2 felt the same way but they just lacked that same feeling.

So the gameplay mechanics are where Div1 shows both an advantage and disadvantage. In the Div2, the gunplay are overall controls were much better, there's absolutely no disputing that. But after all the patches the Div1 got, the devs found the sweet spot, they simplified everything which ultimately made the game much less of a hassle. In the Div2, everything just became so muddled and messy. Div1 gave you your power fantasy and let you feel powerful when you equipped yourself properly while Div2 felt like an eternity of min/maxing which never paid off. In short terms, while they improved the game mechanically, they made everything else so damn messy that it just took away from the fun. While 1-30 in Div1 was awful while the endgame was amazing, it was the exact opposite in Div2.

Now Post Launch support is where these games have a huge difference, we are now at the 2 year mark of Division 2's release and well, the post launch support it has received at this point is abysmal. Summed up by broken and buggy releases, greedy seasons, and an overall lack of community interaction on Massive's part. Div1 delivered a phenomenal turn around with some of the best DLC, specifically Underground, bringing Div1 to the great state it is currently in while Div2 sits in a puddle of disappointment of constant community dissatisfaction from broken promises and undelivered content. They undersold the Div1 and added on with great content later on while the Div2 entirely oversold itself post launch roadmap.

Nitpicks: These are some of my nitpicks on what makes the Div1 a much better game
- Cosmetics are much better looking in this game
- Factions are more grounded in their setting and less kooky than their Div2 counterparts, they belong to their world
- New York has a much better atmosphere than D.C, something about the dark and desolate streets of NY as well as the world feeling more alive
- The builds are simplified so it doesnt feel like you have sit down and calculate your new potential builds
- Base of Operations was SO much better than the white house (screw that alarm) and 2 communities, like with DZ, it just felt like they disjointed your entire BoO and split it into 3 areas while giving much less charm.
- More memorable characters than the Div2, god, this game had much better characters, the ones in the Div2 were just not great
- Facial animations, just look at the difference in the games. They're not perfect here but theyre still better
- The graphics hold up REALLY well for it's age
- More interiors in NY so exploring feels a little more satisfying as every open window and door attracts attention
- Story was pulled off better. While neither game had a great story, Div1 pulled it off better, kept it simple and forward moving while Div2 threw way too much exposition your way.
- Sound design was better, the ambience of walking down the streets down to the gun sounds themselves, for some reason, they made gun sounds in Div2 sound like pop guns.
- More replayable content.
- Much better endgame loop.
- Mostly bug free
- Not riddled with these new ""seasons"" which were basically designed to make people spend money, in other words, no half-assed battlepasses and no half-assed events with recycled rewards with ridiculous grinds
- Grinding feels much less tedious

Overall, even if the Div2 is a slightly more mechanically better game, the Division 1 has come back to the top simply because the devs mishandled the living hell out of Div2. Hell, Div1 still has a pretty active playerbase so you wont have much issue finding games. They did right by Div1 up until 1.8, the game is in a great state, however, it's like they brought Div1 back from the grave and then gave us the Div2 then slowly pushed that into an early grave.",1614227485,1614227485,True,32,1,0.77638775110244751,1,True,False,False

The first time booting It up I had no audio and the game wouldn't load textures. I spent around 3 hours troubleshooting and installing drivers to get it to work. Once I got it working though it was pretty good. I think it may be because I have a relatively low spec rig, even though I surpass the minimum requirements listed on the store page.
I think that it's a good game if you can get it to work, but I would wait for a sale before picking it up especially since its still 30 dollars when the division 2 is out. Another thing to know is that you will have to install Ubisoft software anyways, so you might want to just buy it on Uplay or whatever they're calling it now.",1614105049,1614105049,True,0,1,0.481423050165176392,0,True,False,False

As usual, Ubi games are rock solid on stability. I've not had a single crash. I own a lot of Ubi games, so I'm used to their launcher and need for an account. Integration with Steam works well enough, so I don't see a reason to ding them for that. Graphics look great as they do for all the Far Cry games. It's kind of funny considering this game came out so many years ago and now Cyberpunk can't even figure itself out years later. I'm running a 1080ti, had settings maxed and didn't experience any frame drops or artifacts. Very pleased with the visuals and smooth game play.

As with all games that have preset actions for characters, such as taking cover, it was a little aggravating at times getting the game to respond to what I wanted it to do. When you take cover, getting up out of cover doesn't always work the way you want, so you might end up doing a roll or some other action. I had a couple deaths due to this, although it wasn't bad enough that I didn't enjoy myself. When you are in the heat of a battle, taking all your little digits off the keyboard and pressing what you are supposed to does work most of the time.

I'm an explorer in these games, so it took me around 50 hours to reach max level. I could have reached max level much quicker. Instead I spent time exploring the city, picking up the phones and random stuff along the way and standing around in the base studying how gear worked. The route to level 30 was going really smooth until around level 20. I noticed a steed change in the difficulty and my outdated gear became a big issue for a while until I got caught up. I had to pace myself a bit until I hit 30 because guys on level could beat the spit out of me quite easily if I wasn't paying attention.

Once at max level (30), the game changed a fair amount and what I thought would likely be the end of the game for me since I'm running solo, turned out to be just as eventful for the most part. While there's a lot of group activity focused missions, there was still a good amount I could do just running around. I'm still running around enjoying my new found over powered weapons. You can change the world difficulty, although after taking the beating from 20 to 30, it feels really good to exact some punishment at world level 0.

I found the game for around $12 with DLC, so I saved a good deal and I'm glad I waited to enjoy this. Well worth the money.",1614028915,1614028915,True,1,0,0.481423050165176392,0,True,False,False

Soooooo many bugs.

Gameplay: The original Division gives you a broad variety of options to customize your characters' skills and abilities, and there is a variety of end game content in which to apply those abilities. This is a vastly superior game to the sequel. I have spent a couple hundred hours playing PvE Survival mode, a 1-to-2 run around a 'snowified' version of the map, trying to loot and gear up before the virus timer or NPCs can defeat me. I've never played a game mode within any other game that I've enjoyed more than Division Survival. That is not hyperbole. I recommend that anyone who enjoys shooter games should pick up the gold edition on a flash sale to experience Survival mode.

Graphics, etc: I played hundreds of hours on PS4, and now have discovered that it's an even better game on PC. I just build my PC at a really bad time for GPU prices, so I had to settle for a 5500xt 4GB OC when friends paid significantly less for a 5600/5700 a year or 2 ago, but I'm happy to report that I have yet to experience a lag spike in Division. Lag was the most enduring issue with this game on console. I don't want this to be viewed as a post about which method of gaming is best, because there is plenty to like about console gaming, but Division is running on PC running better than Division 2 runs on PS4. It looks better, it plays smoother, I have no zero complaints so far. If you enjoyed this game on console and like me, now have the opportunity to try it on PC, 10000% you should. It's worth buying it again.

Division 2 is a very polished game, but it lacks the development arc/growing pains that built the original into what it eventually became. Division 1 was very broken at release, especially on PC where players were falling through the map, experiencing flashing lights, etc. The combat went through periods of feeling balanced, then very unbalanced, then eventually landed in a place where it feels good to play with a strong build and chew through enemies quickly, but if you use a bad build, they can do the same to you at higher difficulty levels. The introduction of gear sets and exotics (and eventually improved 'classified' gear sets and the optimization station) gave us the endgame that was originally lacking.

I don't enjoy this game's PvP because players can be very tanky with long time-to-kill, worsened by the spamming of healing and status effect abilities, but this doesn't impact my overall assessment of the game, because I have other games I can turn to for PvP. That said, other players will swear by the Division 1 Dark Zone being one of their best PvP gaming experiences. The DZ did provide a lot of unique moments for me, despite the fact that I was only there to farm vs. NPCs, not fight other players. The objective of extracting your loot and not knowing if your extraction will be disrupted by other players creates an uneasy tension that leads to excitement/relief when you're able to succeed in extracting a special piece of gear.

The only other game that I rank alongside this is Fortnite. I'm sure that some of my love for Division 1 is sentimental at this point; I have so much history with it, and I have grown a lot as a person in the last 5 years, and it was by side for me all of it. I can't guarantee that you'll love it as much as I do, but I promise you it's worth a try if you can get the gold edition for $13.",1613820869,1613820869,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is true! Except that fact it is still a great game! Yes it had a bad start, and in the end it was different from whats once was promised, but it is still pretty epic, with a great story and ambience, and you definteley should pick it up in a sale!
I probably would say you shouldn't go for any AddOns, as it is a bit difficult to find players now for the endgame content since Division 2 was released.

The abandoned city of New York that features in The Division is spectacular, a technical marvel that is insanely detailed, with some of the best lighting and weather effects in gaming. The clarity of detail can make for almost photoreal scenes. Combined with a good sound design, it makes for an immersive world. The meat and bones of this open world revolves around a solid, but unspectacular cover based shooting and loot collecting loop. Shoot baddies, collect more powerful guns and gear for your agent so you can shoot more enemies using better guns. At first, upgrading your character with ever more powerful weapons is fun and addictive, but a few hours in and you realise nothing really evolves. Enemies stay the same, all the weapons feel the same, the core combat feels the same from hour to hour, resulting in a game which just feels repetitive and bland. Even the dark zone seems boring if you keep playing in it - the only fun thing to do there was to become a rouge agent, and you barely make it out alive, or worse, dead, if you choose that route. It's a shame in my opinion, although those first few hours do feel quite special, leaving the rest boring and a grind to finish hence why I quit after a few hours without finishing it. I just Googled the ending of the game to save myself the trouble of having to grind until the end, and guess what?

Here's your TLDR: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME because you cannot play it consistently for even an HOUR most times without it crashing on you.

And the kicker? Ubisoft is probably saying ""no, nothing's wrong with the Division, that's just a bunch of griping gamers"" because THEIR OWN TOOL won't send the crash reports to them!

And it's probably nothing wrong with your rig, even one that's old as mine! DX Dialogue is open. It's saying ""no problems detected"". Hellfire, I play DOA6 on this rig and that game WORKS FINE. Before I abandoned it a month or two ago, I was playing Genshin Impact on this rig with my net connex WITH NARY A HICCUP.

So it's not my rig or even my crappy Philippine connection that's at fault, Ubisoft: it's your bloody infrastructure that's still crap in 2021.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. EVEN ON SALE.

In fact, I should have listened to the people who warned me about Uplay and not plunked money into this game. I thought, ""can't be that bad, right? It's an old game. How horrid could Uplay be? I mean, it's not EA.""

I'm just playing it because I have to make the PhP I put into this thing and the 40 gig it ate from my bandwith somehow worth it. Even then, given the aggravation I get from the crashes - sometimes with you just STANDING THERE IN A SAFE HOUSE DOING NOTHING - makes me think it maybe isn't worth it. 

Maybe I'll just DL Insurgency. Or reinstall ME2. Or just get my adrenaline fix from Hades.

-------------------- Previous Review Begins here -------------------

This is going to be the first negative review (I think) I am going to make of a game. 

Normally, I don't bother - I mean, if I didn't research a game enough before buying it, why go public and condemn it, right? Age of Information. That stuff should be on me - but I felt I have to do this to warn other people about the problems with this game.

Or maybe any other game from Ubisoft that requires both an Internet connection and UPlay.

And you don't have a fast Net connection and specs that can run, say, CP2077.

The Division is actually a good game. In the currently 9 or so hours I have been ABLE to play the game, the experience has been nothing but stellar. Even at the low settings I play it on (because my rig is old) WHEN I CAN PLAY THE GAME she is still quite an experience.

I have played a good deal of FPSes - Resistance: Fall of Man; Crysis 2; all of the Fallout FPS RPGs; Borderlands 1; the first Metro; the ME trilogy - and only one or two of them can compare to the kind of game experience in even a game as old (in 2021) as The Division.

This is a VERY VERY GOOD GAME.

That requires crappy digital infrastructure from the developer/publisher to play.

Seriously, I have spent more time trying to connect to effing Uplay, consistently getting those MIKE and ROMEO errors when I can easily stream even hi-res videos on my connection.

And when you DO connect, you get dumped by the game for one reason or another. Twice, there was an actual error that prompted the reporting tool but it refused to send because I guess Uplay is being a hard-to-get little bugger.

It's 2021, for God's sake. You'd think they'd fixed the bloody thing  by now.

And if a game is not an MMO, then maybe make it so the bloody thing can run even without a Net connex?

This game is great. Excellent even.

But unless you have an amazing Net connection and great gear, don't buy this. Then again, I checked several forums and people with far, far better gear than I were also reporting problems. Heck, I checked the DX tool and found out that, except maybe for the VRAM, I actually have better than the minimum requirements for the game.

Sure you can plan ahead even after a bullshit death, and try to maybe flank, but getting better angles don't do anything. If you can shoot it, it can shoot you and you will die every time. A bullet sponge isn't a fun obstacle. It is tiring, monotonous, and it just feels like lazy game implementation to pad out fights for no reason. Especially if it comes in the form of five dudes and you're only one person, which then the game just says ""good fuckin luck bucko."" Then you die, respawn, and do it again. Loading a full magazine into someones face will never be fun in my eyes, since the damage intake is so imbalanced for the player, and the fact the enemies just get every single damn angle on you it is infuriating. 
  If anything, I actually think the RPG elements made this game far worse. You have to kill everyone one at a time with one full clip at a time, while they can kill you with ease and not reload at all. So you get somewhat realistic properties applied to you in terms of damage intake, while enemies get funny RPG fantasy damage intake. So the game is stuck some of the worst game structure of wanting to be realistic, but not being realistic when a level number is just tacked onto an enemy. The game doesn't know what it wants to do, and it will be unfair everytime. This comes from a solo perspective, which is a terrible way to play this game. But thankfully none of my friends own this crap.
  I tried. I tried to enjoy its combat and atmosphere, because lets face it. The story is crap. So I tried to let everything else work, and I can't enjoy the stupid combat system. So fuck, what do I do? I don't enjoy it for the rest of my life and write this review out of frustration for trying. 
  There you go. A real stinker of a game. 3/10 stuff like that. Probably better with friends, but I don't count on it.

I am really enjoying the post apocalypse setting that's not filled with zombies.  The creators did a good job of creating a world where a virus has killed a bunch of people and brought the U.S. to its knees (even if it's hitting a little close to home right now; yes, I'm talking to you COVID).  This game explores the worst case scenarios where the government has fallen, large numbers of people are dead, survivors are trying to stay alive, and bad guys are trying to take over.  While it's not impossible to play this game single player, you can tell it was designed to be played with friends.  I found some of the missions to be really challenging starting out because you don't have much in the way of weapons, armor, etc.  The bad guys hit hard.  Sometimes it didn't take more than a couple hits to take my character down.  Don't expect to implement much strategy.  This game is designed for you to get behind something and shoot it out with waves of bad guys.  You are going to pick up a lot of weapons along the way.  It didn't seem too difficult to decide which weapons are the best.  I haven't done much in the way of modding or crafting yet.  On a personal note, I actually found the exact hand gun that I own in real life in this game so I can certify that the weapons really do look like the ones in the real world.  While the map is open world, you will be restricted to areas based on your level.

I think what I like about the game the most is listening to the audio recordings, its like they feel all too real sometimes, makes me glad for what we have and realize we are not far away from the game being a reality.

Aside from the story elements the game is challenging in just the right ways, I feel like as a solo player I can beat some real tough encounters with positioning and skills, timing and proper enemy engagement, and on top of that there is actually content that I feel I need to team up with people and thus finding people for such events is still actually easy to do.

1 - Ubisoft Connect SUCKS!!!
It's like Steam but fake and glitchy version.
I still don't get why is necessary to have an Ubisoft account and install Ubisoft Connect to play while there's already Steam.

2 - The game is full of bugs and everytime I open it, it crashes.
To avoid that, I had to install GeForce Experience (and made an account), this allowed me to enlarge the screen resolution without crash (it start windowed by default for no reasons).
But that's not enough: I also have, everytime I launch the game to click The Division's icon on the bottom of my screen for enter in the program otherwise game crash.
I've never seen a thing like this, that's crazy stupid.

3 - Menu and commands are terrible, it's easier to get on the Shuttle and go to space.
From the series ""Press ESC + X then Y and C + RMB + call the president of the USA"" to check your items.
Jesus Ubisoft, is it so difficult to make a simple inventory and menu nowdays? WTF.

4 - My PC is last gen and sometimes still laggy with this game.

Conclusion: 

My father have this game too on Steam and a totally differen PC but he have the same problems like mine, that's quite a proof the PC version of The Division needs a lot of fixes.

If you liked playing Division 1 on hard, I suggest you skip Division 2.
You're forced to play through the game on ""story"" difficulty until you reach the endgame. This means repeating missions over and over. The story difficulty is a waste of time. The only way to lose is if you let the enemies shoot you until you die without fighting back.

The open world enemies (who roams around keeping the open world play interesting) is too rampant. As result, they often interfere with the open world missions (encounters). As result, I'm fighting way more enemies than the game intended (as I am fighting both enemies from the mission and also the open world ones), and am more likely to be killed by the open world enemies rather by the encounter enemies during these missions. Moreover, the designers only intended for coop play, the enemies are often too overwhelming for single player. They need to realize that this game will die down after initial release and not too many people will play it, hence not many people available for coop, hence difficulties need to be tweaked. Especially side missions and encounters are meant to complement the main mission, not the other way around. I have to spend way too much effort on  side missions than main missions. Moreover, respawn points are too far from some of the encounters. I often spend more time running to the mission rather than doing the mission. JTF team mates act like completely untrained cowboys, they either converge around me while I'm shooting and obstruct my field of view, or do nothing and let us get flanked; they are useless! This game has so many things that needs to be improved and polished, yet it seems to me Massive is more concerned with getting the appropriate male female ration for various voice roles than with optimizing and polishing the game. Hey Massive, Since pressing space to enter cover, ever thought about pressing space again to get out of cover? Nope, cause you were more concerned with having a certain ratio of female JTF voices and certain ratio of les characters rather than focusing on improving the game.",1610599349,1610688858,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has an awesome range of guns to use and many enjoyable missions to play. Some downsides to the game for me include the player movement. I play using keyboard and at first the movement can be annoying, but over time its gotten easier to use, like all skills after practicing. It can be a slow paced game at times, but that helps cope with the tremendous amount of tension when fighting tough enemies. All in all it's a good game.

The only real problems I have at 84 hours of playtime is that one of the activities is pretty much impossible to do because it is pvp matchmaking and nobody else is doing it so I've never been able to get into a match. This is made more annoying by the fact that there's a quest marker to do said activity, and it will not go away until you've actually gone into a match which you will likely not be able to do. Also global events haven't really been a thing for a while which is unfortunate and I have no idea if or when they would come back.

Other than that though, I very much enjoy the game. Gameplay is engaging with all the different gadgets and abilities and character builds through gear, and although the story isn't particularly compelling I found that it didn't detract from my experience very much since I didn't really go in expecting much there. The setting is also very nice with New York stuck in a state of ruin during Christmas time, which is oddly beautiful.

At launch the overall scaling and endgame loot and balance were very bad. After the launch of Underground but before the launch of Survival, they undertook a massive rebalance that went a long way towards making this a very enjoyable game, and continued that through the 1.8 patch, and added a new PvE area in the northwest of the map and a lot of Dark Zone north of the original map.

The loot and build possibilities are great, Survival remains one of my favorite game modes of anything ever, and considering this game is now older and the price is either low or extremely low (I think sometimes you can get the entire game, DLC and all for about $10) this is very worth picking up if you like loot based games and/or tactical shooting. Lots of depth if you want to explore it, but enough value to the tactical side that if you just maintain some basic build points you can get through a solid open world and campaign missions arc that I've enjoyed playing through several times now. At $20 it's a very good deal. At $10 it's an absolute steal for the time you can sink, and if you know any friends who didn't play it before, everything after the Brooklyn intro mission can be run with a 4-player group (intro must be run solo AFAIK)",1609528832,1609528832,True,14,0,0.658520162105560303,0,True,False,False

Doing story missions, side quests, walking around new york may be fun.
Endgame gear (classified sets) grinding will be tough - Requires activities involving a party of 4 such as raids (incursions) and wave defenses (resistance). 
Global events do help solo players farm endgame gears but they happen occasionally.

Massive distrust in pvp - this game was once manipulate-able with cheat engine and so many working hacks from China still exists up to this date. If you get killed in pvp zone you are never sure if you got outskilled/better build or cheated. 

Survival DLC is fun and worth - It's a rogue-like race to extraction starting from 0 and you farm your gears to way out. PVE and PVP mode both exists so that new players can learn in PVE mode and more experienced players can compete in PVP mode. Almost no hacks in survival mode and time to kill is much shorter so pvp is actually more fun than regular  darkzone pvp.

Other dlc's aren't really worth mentioning. Like I said above, not many players in this game.

Overall don't take any less than 65~70% off deal including dlcs. Gold edition unnecessary.
Main game + Survival dlc would be good enough",1609389051,1609389051,False,320,21,0.845358312129974365,25,True,False,False

Edit: However if you've played TCTD2 before TCTD be prepared that it is more difficult compared to the 2d one: the drop rates are lower for uncommon items, chests are met not as often as in TCTD2 and survival in general is harder during combats 1 vs 3+. I'd say that in TCTD they've made the bet on co-op rather than single player. Also some items work differently compared to TCTD2. As an example of such difference we can use special ammo: here you pick it up and can use it when needed but it only lasts 30s meanwhile in TCTD2 when you pick up special ammo it becomes main ammo for your currently chosen weapon (at the moment of pickup) and lasts until you use up all the 30 rounds of it. Also different grenade types (frag, smoke, flash etc.) are available from the start in TCTD you just need to find them, meanwhile in TCTD2 they are given later on in the game if at all.

All in all both games are very good in my opinion and I enjoy the opportunity to walk around the districts and inside some buildings just observing how things are there, where I've never been before IRL.

But, I decided to take a look.  I'm really glad I did.  At time of writing I'm LVL 9, haven't got the best gear and I don't really care.  My opinion, as long as you don't try to go for the toughest enemies, try and clear the biggest locations, get the best gear, you can have a very good game experience.

The Division has a great story, a feeling that at one end your doing your part to rectify the devastation that has hit New York, where the civilians really appreciate what your doing (some don't, and I don't think you can shoot them in the ass to get the point across), the other leaving you with a sense of utter frustration as you see civilians stumble and die in the street from either the conditions or the virus.  So you keep plugging on, and you know you have to.

So yes I really recommend getting this game.  There seems like lots to do, lots to achieve and a worthy goal to aim for.  I read somewhere that, as long as your ""ahead of the map"", which I think means as your level grows, stick around in the initial levels and don't venture further that your gear is capable of.  You will lose that bullet sponge feeling.  Try to engage your targets at range, and head shots do make a difference.  Your weapons and gear feel real, you get that sense of carrying lots of tech as you trudge up the street.  I really like the ISAC system, your friendly A.I ally providing you with real time tactical data while your on your mission.  Feels nice and technical.  And one of the best game soundtracks I've heard.

So join up, do your part and help save New York.  Let's face it, most disaster movies and games seem to have that poor city either decimated by a virus, aliens, zombies.. you name it.  Let's help it out one... more... time.

Ubisoft gives Zero F*cks about the Dark Zone hackers who teleport to you and one shot you, Stealing all your hard earned items you worked your @ss off to get.

My favorite part however about the Dark Zone, Is when YOU get called a ""R(e)tard"" for trying to fight back against the hacker(s) and save your  high end weapons and loot.

You know i see so many reviews on steam with only one to twenty hrs in the game then some one thinks they should review it, To me and this is just my opinion that's wasting peoples time' that's why most if not all my reviews have over 100 hrs in the game. But i am old school my interest in computers and computers games goes all the way back to 1983, on a side note if any one who reads this review goes all the way back to then add me as a friend us old school need to stick together. Anyway on we go, The Division when it came out i had a i7 4790k and a GTX 970 GPU and for the most part the game ran very well on high setting and as for modern CPU,s and GPU,s like 20s or 30s cards you should have no problems running it on ultra settings. The story is very engrossing from start to finish i cant say much more than that as i don't want to spoil it for you. As a RPG you can spend hours just on your character alone. The missions and side missions are very varied with very good pacing, Its one of them with this game you can roll on your own or with friends. I've had some people say the games repetitive, People like that need learn how to play a RPG its not GTA 5' but you and i both know they will not be told. As for game play its up there with some of the best game play in any RPG out there even now, I mean you got the snow in New York at night in a fire fight from hell, enemies left and right with heavy fog every where. The thing i can remember the most is just getting lost round the city at night and getting in some mad fire fights some mad stuff going off that's what i will always take away from the The Division. The Dev's up keep of the game what with updates and balancing is simply amazing work. If you have never played The Division then you should give it a go then move on to the division 2 and that's simply amazing with over 785 hrs in that and still rolling.

Ubisoft came the rescue with their first reply within 12 hours of me posting my issue, and within a few days the issue was sorted.

For a now 4-5 year old game from a Triple A company with much bigger, better and newer titles to worry about, let alone the sequel, the customer support given to me took my breath away. Normally it would take over a month for me to get a fix, for that alone out of pure respect I give a positive review for a game I haven't even played.

I heard the game was really good anyways. Hence why I bought it lol.

Thank you Ubisoft Support.

I'm friendly to this sort of over-the-shoulder presentation, other than when the camera fails and I can't see my target but only my own back. ;-)  I'm a play-the-story and run-all-the-side-quests kind of completionist.  If you're not, then some of my commentary won't be as useful.  Stipulating that, there's LOTS to complete in this game and that's very fulfilling.

I like the leveling in the game and found, personally, that running all the side quests and maybe replaying some of the mission content on a harder level let me level up my character ""ahead of the map"".  This let me spend more time enjoying engagements and running the map rather than worrying about dying all the time. I'm not a Dark Souls fan for this very reason.  Again, Your Mileage May Vary.

I find the combat model to be solid, predictable, crisp.  You need a decent graphics card and plenty of RAM to keep the model feeling crisp.  This is a shoot-from-cover game.  No toe-to-toe, hack-and-slash battles here.  On the PC keyboard, movement control in battle, ESPECIALLY while retreating, can be hit-or-miss (please pardon the pun).  My greatest frustrations in the game have been trying to correctly control the keyboard while in retreat.  I often have troubles with the move out of cover walking instead of running, missing the next cover point, or landing on a cover point that is still exposed and having to force the character around the corner.  Lots of dying there.  This may be because I suck at keyboard control.  Could be.  I don't recall having this much trouble in similar situations on the Xbox, which suggests either failing memory or finding the controller easier to navigate than the keyboard in those scenarios.  YMMV.

Interactions with the world are pretty reliable with some minor annoyance from some items that are in field-of-view aren't recognized as actionable. Usually this happens when I'm standing too close to the item.  Not a big deal, but it breaks the flow when you're moving quickly around the map.

I'm VERY happy with the gearing improvements that come at Level 30 as you enter end-game.  I immediately picked up a series of great high-end gear that changed game play for the better.  I was really worried about being tough enough for end-game and wasn't looking forward to the anticipated gear-grind that one sees in, say, Destiny or most RPGs.

Which brings me to the Dead Zone.  I've hated the Dead Zone in the past.  It's just too damn hard.  Yeah, great reward from great risk and all that.  I get it.  But going back and forth between the story line and the Dead Zone never worked for me.  I hit it a couple times coming up through the ranks this play through and it was better than I remembered.  I first journeyed in around L19.  Given the end-game gear and my wildly-improved toughness, I'm ready to give it another try.

Ultimately, this is a really good game.  I enjoyed playing through The Division 2, which I never end-gamed, either.  But this is a solid franchise that provides many hours of enjoyment even for a fairly conservative battle-at-a-distance sort of game play.  And it's an adrenaline rush when you have a skilled run pushing against enemies.  Highly recommended.",1606415733,1606415733,True,21,0,0.738084256649017334,0,True,False,False

+Unique 3rd person RPG,

+current day setting, 

+amazing map and locations that tell a story (unlike Division 2), 

+B A L A N C E (Unlike Division 2), 

+O P T I M I Z A T I O N (Unlike Division 2 even after TU12 it won't be Balanced so, no point in optimization), 

+Great DLC, Underground and Survival are must-haves. Buy the Season pass though if you love the game.

+Game runs well too, just turn down Volumetric Fog if the gas grenades eat your FPS. 4 core optimization. 

+ORIGINAL DarkZone with ORIGINAL Gear Sets, 

+S Y N E R G Y (Unlike Division 2), 

+Challenging yet balanced PVE that feels rewarding and fun to play in the end game.

+Legendary missions are really cool, 

+If you like to help new players, this is a great game that is complex and loot focused, a lot of players need help, and it's (sometimes) easy enough to help them a fair bit.

+Game is on Uplay and EGS so Steam Charts only ever could tell 30% of the player base, it's popular in Europe.

+PVP against players who aren't cheaters can be super fun.

+STILL Global Events happening, 2 in December 2020! 

+++ #Division1forever #Division1AintDead

---Cons---
-Terrible ""guides"" on youtube featuring incomplete info and very bad advice. The more views a video has, the worse it is.

-Game has cheaters in PVP. It will make you rage.

-Ubisoft literally couldn't care less about hackers and cheaters ruining their product, or about cases of public shaming and online abuse. They are the worst in the business, hands down the laziest AAA publisher out there. 

-Chinese VPN players for some reason polluting our regional server in USA (Toronto CA Ubi Server)

-That's right, ALL of NA, CA, and even Mexico + South America on ONE Ubi Server in Canada...Weird.

-Chinese players have a culture of hacking and cheating to gain an advantage, since in their opinion, if you can't be caught then you are stupid not to use cheats. They VPN to America since we have less cheaters, and wreck us. They spam chat until it's unusable and even have boosting businesses built on this game, which.... in total is pretty damn disgusting. 

-No Language specific chat channels and many hidden chat commands that players don't know about such as ""Ignore"", right click names in chat for a small list.

-Hit registration and net code is not on a competitive level, you can't take this game too seriously, even if there weren't cheaters. 

-Even if people don't cheat there are some annoying glitches like the High Firearms D3 glitch some people in the DZ still use. Macros can be used for weird stuff like no recoil and skill proxy throw distance, making the game kind of weird for those who don't know about this BS.

-Sometimes annoying bugs and glitches (like most good games)

People downvoting Division 1 on Steam because Ubisoft decided not to put Divsion 2 on steam....
damn, pure genius. Wish I was that smart. // 

If you know what Rainbow 6 Vegas 2 was all about and enjoyed it.... 
and you like to play in challenging open-world games, with friends whenever possible... 
I think this game is WELL worth whatever they're asking. On any sale it's a steal. 
EVEN from Ubisoft. The game is just that good and fun imo. 
I am honestly mad as hell that I never played this game until recently.

After killing some flamethrower guy, prison escapees and PMC weirdos, don't forget to also enter the shitshow that is the Dark Zone where everything went fubar and players get to kill each other.

Pros:
-especially immersive due to recent events
-HUD is well designed and looks nice
-Plenty of weapons to choose from
-Campaign is alright for an open world game
-most possible gear builds are viable in game and can actually do something
-the Dark Zone experience, although not always pleasant, is definitely worth trying
-Cool Watch that does everything for you, except farming
Cons:
-DLCs suck, Survival is an exception
-online playing only, and sometimes your shots won't be registered by the server, This may kill you when you are in some high tier endgame locations
-Dark Zone is a shitshow
-heavy grind and most things are rng based
-most guys in endgame can tank 100ish~ shots from an endgame machine gun with their faces, this being the main problem since some of these guys can stun lock you once in your proximity and melee you to death. Group up with others to make this less of a problem
-I really want to play Division 2 on steam

I literally spent 90 hours in 2 weeks on this game when I first started seriously playing it. So much stuff to do, massive grind, normal PvE gets boring at some point but the Dark Zone never loses of its charm and is literally the sole reason this game exists at this point. The Dark Zone (DZ) is at this point an Among Us shooter. You go in, mask on, geared like Rambo and you fck people up or you get fcked. You can easily find people to either hang out with or kill once you know the map a little bit. 

One thing which made me fall in love with this game, SO MUCH FREEDOM. You walk around the streets, you fight some NPC idiots, you chill for a bit, then new enemies. There's so much stuff to do. 
Personally the most satisfying thing which happens is when I arrive into a gang war, some NPC idiots against some other NPC idiots and enjoy the view, chill, shoot at the low hp ones to get the kill exp, and resume the chilling.

Sets are a hassle to learn at first but there aren't too many, I've basically memorized them all at this point and I've got all the 4 pieces sets obtained. Meta weapons basically consist of assault rifles and SMGs. My personal preference is to have a sniper rifle, very good against tanky af elites and bosses. 
Check out guides or w/e you can find about weak points if you're new, they do help tremendously and can turn the tide of a firefight in PvE. 

ALSO (he didn't pay me for this) CHECK OUT WIDDZ ON YOUTUBE MY LEARNING CURVE WENT THROUGH THE ROOF AFTER LOOKING AT LIKE 10 VIDEOS

Anyway, this game is better than The Division 2, and I don't see myself getting massively bored of it to the point of uninstalling it anytime soon. 

Is it worth 20 bucks ? Hard to say. Less ? Instabuy.

They did a great job of building their world for you to play in and trying to make it as seamless as possible. Bullet sponge enemies aren't my cup of tea for games that are supposed to be based in the real world. Emptying 2+, 30 round magazines (with every shot connecting) with an M16 and the guy is still running around like nothing happened isn't cool, it's annoying and it's even more annoying when people can soak a .50 cal to the face when they aren't running around in future armor.

[h1]The Division Review[/h1]

The Division stands out differently from all other games. It’s not just a game, it’s a whole feeling. It provides everything that an excellent title should have. A brilliantly detailed and vast map, a lot of customizations, challenging enemies, re-playability, multiplayer, and a smart split of PVP and PVE regions makes the game a masterpiece and counts as a new-gen game. Color schemes and combat mechanics are all amazing. The number and level of enemies depend upon your lobby size, making it ideally challenging with friends. Don’t wait and enter the streets of New York to establish peace and order. 

[h1][b]Gameplay:[/b][/h1]
The scene portrays a pandemic in New York City that gave origin to many riot groups and gangs that are not co-operating with the officials. As an agent, your job is to restrict any illegal activity or inhumane actions. Establishing peace during a pandemic is a challenging task, that’s why division agents are recruited. Every segment of the map holds its side missions, crates, dossier, and encounters. Your gameplay experience will determine according to the customizations you configure, gears you loot, or missions you select. Firing feels super smooth irrespective of the gun you use. Authentic guns make the combat super intense. Pretty amazing to use a Vector with its incredible RPM, or finding that power punch M44. It doesn’t end here as you can even have 30+ weapon talents that add bonuses to your weapon. 

Variation in enemies is always a crucial part of a game, and division has a good variety in style and difficulty of combat. Some of them will die quickly, while some are built like tanks and will require loads of ammo magazines. As you can’t jump in the division series, so only specific objects are climbable. There are no vehicles, so you will have to travel on foot, but a lot of encounters with enemies can happen, so either select that or use fast travel on safe zones by completing their respective missions. According to your party size, the number of enemies change, which keeps the game difficulty balanced and fun.  Your primary objective is to establish a Base of Operations (or BOO), where you can meet other players and unlock three wings – Tech Wing, Medical Wing, and Security Wing. It broadens up the gameplay hours by a lot, personal favorite missions as they are unique, and each upgrade can provide one or more Perks, Skills, or Talents for the player, as well as making cosmetic changes to the wing and the base overall.

[h1][b]Graphics:[/b][/h1]
Hands down to the best realistic graphics that you will encounter in an open-world game. They are not bland nor too shiny, making it a perfect balance. The moment you enter the map, you will see gorgeous detailing and an impressive design. Every structure you see on the map can exist in the actual world, making it a great game to have a realistic experience. The snowy atmosphere is a delight to the eyes. Glass reflections and sun glares are all amazingly done. You will be surprised to see the amount of detailing done on the inner and outer parts of the map. Small detailing like tiny logos on machines, torn pages on the ground, graffitis, pianos, and photo frames in houses. Probably the only game with so much text on the screen and still no interruption on screen as it blends perfectly. The orange tint for the interactive menus feels so good. And all these detailing on a huge map! 

[h1][b]Main Pros and Cons:[/b][/h1]

[b]Pros-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Great overall game.
    [*]Broad gameplay.
    [*]Supports multiplayer. 
    [*]Astonishing graphics and in-depth detailing.
    [*]Story feels real.
    [*]Impressive way of supporting PVE and PVP playstyles.
    [*]Various gear customization.
    [*]Easy to learn controls.
    [*]Good looking attire and skins.
    [*]Aim shoulder swap.
[/list]

[b]Cons-[/b]
[list]
    [*]It might feel challenging for a lot of player base because some of the enemies require a lot of bullets.
    [*]Stutter and crash issues on minimum rigs.
    [*]NPC allies are dumb.
    [*]Dark zone has hacker problem.
[/list]

[h1][b]Tips to new players:[/b][/h1]
Only play single-player if you are ready to grind and face a big wave on enemies. An effective agent depends a lot on his gear. So instead of sticking to one type of gear set, change them while leveling up. You can add mods to specific equipment that will help you in combats. Focus more on wing missions as they unlock several weapon talents and perks. The most basic and effective gear set is to use high damage sniper, high rpm rifle with a big mag, and a good firepower pistol. If you are struggling with knowing where the enemies are, use tactical scanner ability that can be unlocked by the medical wing, this will highlight all enemies on the radar. 

[h1][b] Miscellaneous Information:[/b][/h1]

[b]Dossier-[/b]
Along with the story missions, there are several side tasks that award you extra items. 
[list]
[*]Division Shields - Shields are a collection of twelve collectibles that reward players for completing challenges throughout the game. Earning a Shield will reward the player with a shield cache that contains a selection of valuable items and currency bundles. They also give rewards that you can redeem in division 2.
[*]Commendations- These are specific general and combat challenges that reward you cosmetic cypher fragments which can be used to buy 3 random premium cosmetic items from the premium vendor.
[*]Evidence- A unique way to gather information that helps you to figure out what is really going on in New York.
[*]Field Data- It can be categorized into six categories: Survival Guidebook, Phone Recordings, Incident Reports, Crashed Drones, Missing Agents, Echos, and each one has different missions and rewards.
[*]Expansions- Visit underground to collect audio journals and urbex albums for extra rewards.
[/list]

[b]Loadouts-[/b]
The game has the option to make six loadouts that you can switch anytime according to the combat. 

[b]Crafting-[/b]
You can use electronic parts, fabrics, weapon parts, and tools to craft better mods and gear.

[h1] Honest Rating:[/h1]
Division not only slays the graphics scene but also stays firm in the gameplay aspect. There is a lot of stuff to do in the game, making it high hour grinding game. Select your gameplay according to PVE or PVP preference. Remarkable in-game UI and multi-player options make it a perfect pick to play with friends. Highly recommended game, even without a sale.

Each gear piece is unique, from it's helmets, braces, padding, armor, and weapons. It's incredibly stat based and talent based, and you can build and form your character in a lot of ways. It's more of an RPG than a shooter, and that's what I was looking for. For an RPG game, I'd give it an 80%, as a video game 60%, and as a shooter 80%. It's a progression game, from the player statistics, the gear which you can fine tune, to the skills, talents, and the way you can choose how to form the base camps. Overall, I like this game better than it's sequel, which is a PvP game, whereas this is a PvE game. I can see how this game isn't for some people, because it's mainly an RPG, and some play it as a shooter.

I phrase it this way because it has the appearance of a AAA title, but really just fails on extreme basics. I write this from the perspective of someone that has been gaming for about 30 years, everything from super hardcore sims to casual side-scrollers.

The failings are in basic mechanics:

--The tutorial system likes to flash something at you very briefly, then permanently disappear before you have a chance to actually read it.
--The menu system is bewilderingly complicated. There are tabs upon tabs upon tabs, organized in a seemingly random way. It really blows my mind how a design factor like this could be overlooked.
--There is no pause. I can see why a rogue-like game or a purely multiplayer would do this, but in theory this is a single-player game with MP elements. The fact that there is no separation between SP and MP is actually a hindrance. I don't have any interest in multiplayer, ever...but I can't pause the freakin' game.
--On that note, even if I accept I can't pause it, and instead go to one of the safe areas so I can take a phone call or something IRL, it ends my game with no announcement and kicks me to the main menu. This occurs after only a few minutes of inactivity. Apparently I'm supposed to keep flailing around at all times or I'm punished. A simple ""do you wish to leave and SAVE YOUR PROGRESS"" would be nice. Note: I am talking about an actual game mechanic, not a bug.
--It doesn't tell you that certain actions in a mission are part of a larger objective, and if you leave the game at that point, you will have to repeat that entire @*$&% story arc. I quit at one point and literally had to redo about 30 mins of gameplay.
--And when you have to repeat anything, due to leaving the game or getting killed, you will have to listen to the entire radio transmission history again and again, each time you respawn. I'm trying this mission for the 7th time, I don't need to be briefed...AGAIN.
--And why am I trying this mission for the 7th time? Because the cover system is laughably terrible. I'm rolling no wait I'm going into cover no wait I'm sticking to this wall no I'm trying to get *off* this wall no I'm trying to go around the corner no I'm trying to move to the next piece of cover but no I've left cover for no apparent reason now I'm dead again. I don't what type of player likes this system. There are plenty of games that handle ""sticky cover"" fine...this one, not so much.
--Enemies frequently shoot through objects and kill me when I'm behind solid cover. Maybe it's just through some impossible 1-pixel-wide tear in the time-space continuum...but how they're able to do this is invisible to the player. This happens a lot. One enemy, downrange, I'm crouched behind a metal crate, and something just one-shots me in the face. Not fun. Again - basics.
--What is with all the floating GUI overlays in the world? I can see why Deus Ex would do this, because he's a cybernetically-enhanced guy with AR goggles. But why is my GPS position, my objective, my waypoint to the objective, the sub-waypoints, etc all overlaid on virtually every surface? It really breaks immersion and it's really friggin annoying. Ideally I should see one overlay - the objective, and then have to consult the map for more detail (like literally every other game in existence). I just want all those cheesy lines to go away lol.
--Missions are reeaaallly repetitive. I'm only 9 hours in, and I feel like I've seen it all. Same hooded-sweatshirt guys saying the same lines over and over. I'm just...bored.

It's a bummer to be so negative as I generally don't leave reviews like this...but this game has really basic design/mechanic problems. Oy.

The devs are listening & communicating with us & that doesn't happen very often!

The gunplay is awesome. The cover system works great. There have been a lot of people complaining that the AI are boring, however, as someone who has completed dozens of ""Challenging"" missions over the last couple days I can tell you that they are anything but. You can fight the same group of mobs 30 times and they will constantly change their tactics based on how you play.

**Update as of 12/25/17**

I sidelined this game for quite a while in hopes that when I finally decided to pick it up again there would be plenty to do.

After patch 1.8  I decided to hop on again and see what has been added and changed and I was extremely disappointed. There have been several purchasable DLC's and major update since the last time I played,  But I find myself doing the exact same things that I was doing when the game was first launched.

Grind for gear so you can grind for gear so you can grind for gear.

You are fighting the exact same enemies the use the exact same tactics the only thing that has changed is that you are fighting them in different locations on the map.

When I think ""mmorpg""  I think of games like World of Warcraft, Everquest, etc.  The common theme being that there is a reason for all of your grinding, that reason being end game content/bosses that you are working towards defeating. Defeating those final bosses in a raid is what the entire PVE aspect of the game is about. The gear and rewards you get for killing those bosses just a bonus.

In The Division, gear is literally everything. The entire game is simply grinding for gear and there is really nothing special about that gear. The end game simply revolves around you upgrading the stats on your gear so you can continue to farm more gear, which eventually just becomes useless junk because reaching the maximum available item level doesn't take very much time at all.

This game was marketed as an MMORPG/tactical shooter and I feel like it has failed bringing us either of those.

I had about a week's worth of enjoyment from this game when it was first released, but I don't see any reason to play it anymore.

It was an interesting blend of genres that, with a heavy marketing push, ended up paying off financially for Ubisoft and creating a successful new franchise.

The story revolves around a post-apocalyptic New York after the city has been put in quarantine due to deadly pandemic. Sounds familiar? It is only a few steps away from the current events, so it can definitely help with the game immersion. :) Although the New York City is well designed and the attention to detail is fantastic, it can be a bit stale always experiencing snowy environment.

When it comes to gameplay, it will either make or break the game for you. It involves moving cover to cover, using different weapons and skills, and constantly replacing weapons and gear with better rolled stats. The main complaint people had with this game when it first came out was the “bullet sponginess” of enemies: “They are human enemies yet they take so many bullets - Me cannot compute!” This is intentional design of the game and there really is no gameplay issue with it. Besides, if you are using a rifle or marksman rifle and go for headshots, enemies are really easy to kill. An issue that I do have with the game though is the difficulty curve. If you do all the side missions along the way, you become very overpowered and the game provides no real challenge later on. Another well-known main problem is the lack of the end game content. After you finish the story there is really nothing else to do but the Dark Zone, a PvP/PvE part of the game. For this zone you really need to have the proper gear and teammates, because if you don’t, you will get wrecked by people who have both and know what they’re doing. The Dark Zone was not the most appealing part of the game to me and I'm not sure how active is nowadays.

If you treat this game like a campaign/story experience you will not be disappointed. If you are able to get 3 more friends to play this with, the game becomes even better. The difficulty scales significantly and it is much more fun to coordinate and experience the game with a group. For the end game content I would suggest focusing on The Division 2, as it has much more to offer.",1602125592,1602125592,True,4,1,0.520063459873199463,0,True,False,False

MGR Gaming’s Conclusions:
Spoilers Ahead:

As far as Tom Clancy games go, this is a brilliant new Gameworld. Even though this is the first one where weapon damage is less realistic than the others. It still gives you that fantastic Tom Clancy experience.

The game paints a very visual and vivid picture of how bad things have gotten, as services failed things piled up and the situation got much worse. It paints a very realistic picture of what such an event or any world level catastrophic event could cause. 

The gameplay is both good and bad. The enemies really are “bullet sponges” and that isn’t just due to the game being an RPG; The games combat mechanics really need some balancing. The end result isn’t really that rewarding, to be honest. For an RPG one would expect the DPS to be comprised of some unique modifiers and other contributors, unfortunately, that is not the case here. It basically comes down to finding gear with better stats, and no unique modifiers. It is quite difficult to accurately measure your combat strength and prowess due to how the system was set up, further bringing down the ‘wow factor’ here.

The above does bring the overall long-term joy down that the game offers, especially when it comes down to end game grinding and playing, however, I am hopeful that a future patch will rebalance this.

The gameplay is fun and rather memorable; however, it also gets lonely quite fast. There are, unfortunately, no random occurrences or even scripted occurrences for you to come across whilst exploring Manhattan. There is the odd chance that you will run into some JTF troops randomly patrolling the streets or engaging enemies. That however is it, which is disappointing, especially since this is considered an Open World MMO. One would expect there to be plenty more to see and do.

The Dark Zone is a rather unique aspect. You get to explore a brand new zone that is ready to face you. Enemies scaled to your level and to make matters even more challenging, rogue agents. You will meet fellow agents whilst exploring the Dark Zone, and things can go either way. They might aid you or they might attack, kill, and rob you of your hard earned loot. 
The Division has a lot of potential and it is fun as is. It can be better for sure, once a few updates fix the current problems that exist and perhaps add some new features.

However, I cannot say the game is perfect because it does have quite a bit of flaws and time has not always been kind. The most important thing is that the enemies are pure bullet sponges; they take so much more to kill than you, and there is a lot of grinding you need to do in order to feel like it's 'fair.' This makes it very hard or unfun for solo players who don't like grinding, especially if you go into the Dark Zone (which is a PVE area that has succumbed to hackers and the most elite players as most players left the game years or months ago). The Dark Zone is an optional PVE area, but it is a big area for gaining better weapons fast; so if you're scared of the online play from hackers, not liking PVP, etc. then you'll find 1/3 of the map unusable. Another smaller thing though is that gameplay is repetitive as the missions don't change. 
In general though, I do recommend the game because I had a lot of fun when I first played, and I log in every now and again for a quick game. However I'm very comfortable with solo play, I'm okay with grinding, and I'm not a big PVP type, so if you are 𝘕𝘖𝘛 like me then I cannot recommend the game.",1600704023,1601059536,True,27,0,0.716539084911346436,0,True,False,False

I just spent hours just simply trying to get the flipping game to work. It wont let you delete old profiles, wont go into full screen mode when you set it to that, you have to play the game with the stupid windows bar at the bottom of the screen because for some reason it wont go away, when you shoot at enemies you have to unload a million bullets into them just to drop them, even if they are head shots. CMON, ARE YOU SERIOUS? YOU GUYS SPENT ALL THIS TIME MAKING THIS GAME BUT COULDNT INCLUDE THESE SIMPLE THINGS? This is my second try at playing this game and i havent even been able to play for because i can figure out how to restart game and all the other various problems. I am reminded now adsactly why i quit trying to play this game a couple years ago, because everything is screwed up. what a waste of my time. IM SOOO IRRITATED.2nd Part of REVIEW: So, after spending a day figuring out how to find all the secrets out about how to delete an old profile, to create a new one, and i worked on the full screen/window bar problem and it started working, and then did a whole bunch of research about what all the different little numbers on the huds mean and other mechanics of the technical aspects of the game, I finally was able to start playing again and this is what i have to say about it.ABSOLOUTLY BEAUTIFUL. THE GAME IS ABSOLOUTLY BREATHTAKINGLY FLIPPING BEAUTIFUL. I thank you guys for taking so much time out to make such an impressive environment, all the detail, the whole experience, is worth all the pain of what I had to go through to get there. I came all the way back here to fix this review because you guys deserve it. You did an amazing job. I also happen to think I am an above average FPS player, and i want to mention a few things about the gunplay etc. I appreciate that you spent alot of time with the different customizations options for us to toggle at our liking of the weapons. I also, appreciate that after upgrading the weapons and figuring out how to use the scopes properly so that i could turn it into a fps appropriatly when needed. Honestly, I love how i can kind of choose between 1st and 3rd person view to an extent. I had to place my zoom button somewhere easily accessible so that it would leave me with a seamless experience when in a firefight. And, honestly, i like it. I like that i can change between the two views. Def deepens the visuals and experience. As for the AI. A+. The tactical movements of the AI were well done. As, for the sponge issue with the bullets. That should be fixed please. I cant stand that. I do understand that it is needed for more unexperienced players. But, honestly, screw them. lol. How are they supposed to learn huh? Just kidding. No, but serious, can we at least have a hardcore setting to eliminate that issue for those that need that type of gunplay? I am not expecting changes of course to this since its so old, but, maybe for future games you make? Also, very happy with the way you set up the communication aspect for the players in group management. Communication is everything. THANK YOU FOR MAKING SUCH AN AMAZING GAME.

No negotiations, no arrests, no saving wounded or starving people, no rebuilding anything. Wait, you said we were emergency service professions not soldiers? You are right!! And you also fight professional soldiers in the game. So Its like getting stuck in bizarro world of bat sh*t ideas? Correct.

The gun play seems perfect until about mid game, than bullet sponge ruins the remainder of the “core experience”. Take out this boss in 15-30 head shots.... wait what? Yay its realistic, he is bamf. *vomits* 

Your character is stronger than the plague that wiped out the city. As you gun down hundreds upon thousands of rioters, looters, ex prisoners. Wait? I thought we saved people? Nah man Violence solves everything right?

The story is contrived, filled with tropes and stereotypes. By division 2 they totally deviate from plausibility to outright fiction. Perhaps writing something believable was beyond their capabilities OR they wanted to make a different game. Who knows but the introduction to holograms, bad guys with unlimited resources and military equipment that would be impossible to move around cities decimated by “freak” tornados and weather events on top of the plague are just a few cherries to add to the s**t cake. 

Some characters act completely different than what is written about them in the games own archives; i.e some one is a level headed professional mercenary but their npc dialogue and what they actually does is totally a 180 boss fight. “What a twist” screams M night!

This type of trash appeals to as specific type, sharknado fans or meta gamers. Enjoy your mountain dew kids.",1600034779,1600035093,False,5,2,0.494177788496017456,0,True,False,False

2 enemy factions (both just variations between thug and thug with flamethrower) which will both bore you 2 hours in. Only difference is whether or not they have a flammable canister strapped to their back. They'll do nothing to make the story more immersive and they only come in a few variants (generic gunman, melee dude, engi placing turrets, sniper and heavy gunner). Bosses are just the same with bigger healthbars. They're still just bland bullet sponges and that's all you'll end up doing aside from PvP, which always ends up just being a simple match of ""who has the biggest numbers"".

And for some reason they have yet to figure out what a PC is. The controls are very clearly not meant for PC and the person in charge of assigning keybinds but have been having a stroke. Duck behind cover defaults to spacebar. Jump, of all bloody things, defaults to ctrl. Forward roll defaults to double-tapping ctrl. Shift is sprint, but shift is also the button for changing the third person camera from looking over the right shoulder to the left shoulder and vice versa. The map doesn't seem to notice that there's a mouse, no click-and-drag options exist and you move it with freaking WASD. Scrolling doesn't even seem to register when zooming. Every interaction is a damn hold-to-confirm action even when you're in a hurry. Inventory has a bunch of dumb keybinds that could have just been a right-click drop-down menu. But no, that'd be too much effort in a cheap PC port. These devs don't care about their users. They shoved their button mapping over to some default keybinds by a guy who never played a PC game in his life and figured that'd be it. 

If the game was any good, I'd forgive such a lazy PC port. Hell, I love NieR: Automata despite having only played its PC port and that one had a lot of similar issues. But this is a bloody shooter. Shooters are best played on PC thanks to mouse control being more accurate than a controller could ever allow. Yet controls feel sluggish while running away from enemies that can 2-hit you while you can only hope to kill them on your 5th magazine because of their dumb bullet-sponge design. 

Free is the only correct price-point for this lame snoozefest of a game. And even then there's better things you could do with your time.",1599241593,1599241593,False,3,2,0.498906165361404419,0,True,False,False

Note: Free to claim on Uplay until September 8th

[h3]Introduction[/h3]
Let me just start off by saying [b]IF[/b] I pre-ordered this, I would be [b]severely[/b] disappointed. The Division Is a looter shooter with RPG elements. It's set in the visually stunning New York City after a disease brings the country to its knees. You - The Division - are your ordinary folk tasked with bringing order back into NYC after those events (By shooting people). That's all I got really from around 16 hours of game play.

[h3]Story and gameplay[/h3]
The story is not interesting enough to engage me. The premise has potential but it's poorly executed - much like the gameplay. Now This is an RPG which means you will get slaughtered if enemies are higher level than you. I can accept this. What I can't accept is that enemies are really bullet spongy, even at your level. This has never been fun, so I don't know why devs keep doing it.  Having to empty a mag to kill a single enemy feels very sluggish and unenjoyable. The only time gun play felt good was when enemies where much lower level, and I could drop them within 5 or 6 rounds. It's also a looter shooter and the guns all feel the same. It's not meant to feel like that.  Sounds are also lack luster. They aren't horrid but they are lame enough to notice.

[h3]Neworking[/h3]
Bad gunplay is exaggerated by the fact that there are no local servers and an online connection is required to play, even solo. Now this might not be an issue for everyone, but it was for me. Having AI enemies rubberband around and teleport closer to you when their primary weapon of choice is a fire axe that can drop you in a couple hits, it's pretty irritating. Certain sound effects are also tied to latency like, TF? I have played games with no local severs, but the networking in this game is kinda [b]really[/b] bad. It's unfortunate because the devs cared more about DRM than player experience. This could have been mostly mitigated should they have just had local play. There is no P2P/listen server support in this. Playing online was just messy and there could have been some fun to be had if playing with friends.

[h3]Monetized[/h3]
Now It wouldn't be an Ubisoft title if it wasn't monetized to hell and back. It's all here - Season Pass, DLC, In-game microtransactions, lootboxes, all that crap. This was surprisingly hard to find too. Now most if not all of it is cosmetic but cosmetics in this game are kinda lame. That's coming from someone who loves customisation. Pretty sure I saw a hat you can buy for 5 USD. Like Really? At that point I could go out and buy a hat for myself IRL.

[h3]Final experience[/h3]
I thought I'd have one last push on the game. So I booted it up ran a KM, died, respawned a KM away, ran back, died again, realised It was a really high level area, ran some more, got into the central hub, I was told to interact with a terminal, but at the terminal I was told to talk to someone. So I ran around for 15 minutes looking for them. [i]That doesn't sound like a lot but you run around for 15 minutes looking for where to go.[/i] So I left came and came back turns out the character didn't spawn in? I still couldn't interact with them so I watched a Youtube tutorial and they interacted with them, while I couldn't. Nah This wasn't worth it. It Didn't tell me who I had to interact with, I just had to spam [i]E[/i] on everything and hope for the best. This was the final nail in the coffin. This wasn't fun. 

[h3]Positve notes and twocents[/h3]
Now the game DOES look good, its visually stunning in some areas. It feels like a believable setting and place. There are some really cool things like micro destruction on glass, bullets create holes in like in siege. When in cover your character is in cover and moves over an open door they will close the door. Things like that. The game is really nice for some cool screenshots, but it's a hassle to turn off the HUD and there is no dedicated photo mode. I bought this game for around $5 and honestly I don't know if I'd pay more unless you really know this is the game for you, and you know what you're getting in to. I'm not saying  you can't have fun with The Division but there are games out there that do The Division so much better. It just feels like It has no soul, a husk. Apparently some of the DLC is fun like survival but I don't own it so I can't say anything more than that.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] [i]This is a collation of my thoughts, before I uninstall it. I'd Rather have the HDD space than the potential for nice looking screenshots. It's uninspired, clunky to some regard, and gameplay is ruined by bullet spongy enemies, bad networking, and an always online DRM. Monetization is very egregious, also an in-game hat that costs $5. Save your money, and go buy yourself an IRL fedora instead.[/i]",1598213610,1598973646,False,2,1,0.461538463830947876,0,True,False,False

went back into the game.
pros: not that many hackers or people in the DZ
cons: not that many people to play with period. 

there's been tons of updates since 3 years ago. I have a lot to get through between DZ, survival, and the other terminal stuff. you'll still run into a few hackers here and there (that's probably the only reason why they're still playing the game--no one to report them) but i digress. It's a game I'd boot up after a long 12 hour shift and just want to mow through a few cleaners here and there. 

love playing this game, it's everything a casual player needs. Just the occasional running and gunning, loot, and continuous updates. I love going into the DZ with my squad using different odd combinations going rogue, ganking solo players (though we get called hackers A LOT). some players just can't accept that there are those better than them (some are just silly enough to stay and take on all 4 of us)--there are no rules in the DZ, deal with it. 

Aside from the hackers, I think Massive has been taking the right direction going through the waves the perma-bans and fixes. No game is perfect and I'm just glad that they go through the community forums and adjust the game accordingly. I'd wait for a few months before deciding to buy the season pass itself due to the possibility of bugs and whatnot.

It's been a while since I've seen an user interface this slick - The diegetic panels hanging in thin air sell the feeling of modern urban warfare more convincingly than a dozen of imaginary gadgets and beam weapons ever could.

Or maybe the best part is the post-catastrophic New York itself. A sizable chunk of a city ravaged by a weaponized virus has been meticulously created, and it looks and feels absolutely spot on. There are small details and nice touches everywhere, and exploring the alleys, stores and subways is constantly rewarded with little snippets of information that reveal the plight of the individuals caught up in increasingly dire circumstances.

The game doesn't shy away from its heavy subject matter. I'd say the worldview of The Division is surprisingly dour for a high-profile AAA blockbuster. The somber tone is disrupted only by the side mission voiceovers which try to add a dash of humor to the game, ending up sticking out like a sore thumb.

The environment tells a much better story than the main plotline, which is mostly concerned about shutting down various factions operating in the city and providing the players with more fodder to chew through. The shoot & loot gameplay of The Division manages to stay smooth and engaging although the enemy variation is minimal: Shooting guns just feels right, which is weird considering you'll usually have to unload a whole clip for a single bad guy to give up the ghost.

Moment-to-moment tactics never rise into a big role when playing alone, but jumping into a small group brings up the nuances of engagements better, with actual flanking moves and planning required, especially on the higher difficulty levels.

Praise must also be heaped upon the Snowdrop Engine, which is one of the most impressive pieces of graphical technology for the current generation. It might not be the fanciest engine, but the vistas it manages to consistently pull off are certainly impressive. Sound is not quite as great, and there's a lot of repetition in the audio that is somewhat jarring.

Anyhow, I quite enjoyed my time with The Division, playing both alone and in a group. The game nails the tempo of individual firefights, but more importantly it understands the value of quiet moments as well. Jogging along the deserted streets, just exploring and taking in the views remains my favorite thing in the game.

The Division is a solid cover-based loot shooter. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table; It just polishes an existing formula to a pleasing sheen. I think it's easily better than Borderlands, for example. Maybe that's because I found the subject matter way more compelling. It's a Tom Clancy game with the usual Tom Clancy gun/military/technology worship toned down. This post-apocalyptic world proved to be more interesting than anything Fallout 4 had to offer.",1458407681,1598131894,True,4,0,0.502186238765716553,0,True,False,False

Aspects of the game are more linear and confining than one would expect in a looter shooter with an open-worldish feel. There's plenty of gear and character customization, and the visuals are really good. On the downside, movement can be janky, and the default keybinds are unorthodox and confusing. The shooting is also decidedly softcore; it sometimes feels like you have to empty two clips straight into a tango's baseball cap to down him. I'm not asking for a mil-sim in a looter shooter, but for a game that keeps prompting you to duck, take cover, and act tactically, the shooting is much closer to Call of Duty than CS:GO.

A modified version of Smallpox has spread throughout New York during Black Friday and has forced the government to quarantine new york given the immense amount of victims. The USA president activates Directive 51 which consists in activating sleeping agents of an ""unnamed"" Division to send them in the quarantine zone to assist, maintain order and investigate the reasons of the outbreak. This was called the first wave as they went missing. Here comes the Second wave of The Division. Here starts the game: you're the second wave! The story is very simple yet intriguing, but DO NOT EXPECT CUTSCENES or stuff like that, the whole story is more like a pretext for the game itself, but if you enjoy the game you can find all crumbs and pieces of story through secondary missions, collectibles and endgame content. With them I've been able to get a bigger picture of the situation from multiple points of view, though it's not fundamental. And no, it doesn't require my playtime for that.


GRAPHIC. Engine And Artistic aspects.

Despite the Downgrade scandal, The Division still shows a marvelous New York with Massive's very own Snowdrop Engine. The biggest visual strength of the game is not about the variety of models (because it's pretty poor under that aspect, both for your own character and for your enemies), but in the game's world: a believable recreation of New York recreated with well known places and buildings but the biggest positive note lies in the immense amount of care for small details: some snowy roads might look the same as some buildings are quite common, but there are abandoned cars, buses or garbage truck, rubbish, animals and any sort of tracks that will make you think there was life there until a week ago, or more. Such as pile of bodybags. Or worse. Besides this gruesome example, you will notice an immense care for details that will require a bit of horsepower from your system to fully enjoy them.


GAMEPLAY. How does it work?

Let's start with the basics: you can play with up to 4 friends cooperatively. The game is a third person shooter full of RPG mechanics. So you go around and shoot in third person view, you loot enemies for armor parts or weapons, scavenge bags and backpacks looking for crafting elements or items that will give you small buffs (Healing factor, status immunity). All of this while you raise you character level to maximum cap of 30 and unlock passive and active abilities. The game is full of side missions, Encounters, Incursion (difficult wave-based missions) collectibles and main missions. Once you're done with the main missions and reach level 30 you reach the ""endgame"" that unlocks higher difficulties and world tiers (another way to increase the whole world difficulty), which will reward you with higher class items, rarest and unique items (if you're lucky) while you will face tougher enemies. Way tougher enemies. It will unlock also the ability to enjoy global events which consists in particular bonus paired with malus that change the gameplay increasing fun. They usually run for a week once a month and they advertise them via twitter. There's much more to say about all mechanics but Steam has its limits so suffice to say there's more to this, including PvP, Dark Zone, and so on.",1597000573,1597000573,True,34,2,0.715166628360748291,0,True,False,False

The division is one of the best games I have ever played, the story is decent and the game play is cover based with some non cover based mechanics. A lot of people argue that if you are not a hardcore player then the game is boring and tedious. I was not a hardcore player and only played a lot until I beat the campaign in patch 1.5, after that I bought the DLCs and played a few games of each (if you want more context on the DLCs check out my review of the season pass.) I played one campaign by myself and even bought 3 of my friends this game. I beat the game with 2 of them and never did with the 3rd. This game is a great game to play with friends, it has build diversity and even pvp that takes more skill then just aiming well. The game has 3 main build paths, Firepower, Toughness and Skill power. Firepower relates to the amount of damage you do to your enemy, Toughness relates to how much health you have and Skill power relates to how much healing or damage your skills do. There are over 14 unique gear sets that all have different functions with specific perks that make them better depending on if you want to be a sniper, tank, healer, dps and more. 


PVP in the division. PVP in this game is highly reliant on reaction time and good builds. Many people argue that having a god build is required to win in PVP but that is not correct and bias. The game rewards you for being the better player in most instances. If you and a guy are shooting eachother and you can shock nade him he is disabled for a few seconds giving you the advantage, being a smarter player is essential for surviving in PVP. The main place you will encounter other players where you can fight is in the Dark Zone, in here it is PVE and PVP, this is one of the places to get some of the best loot after beating the campaign. To get loot you have to clear landmarks which have difficult enemies that drop on average 3 pieces of gear. The max amount of things you can carry in the Dark Zone is 9, after reaching the limit you have to go to an extraction point and extract the loot which fending off enemies that are trying to stop you. Other players can find and kill you at any time, but this requires them to go ROGUE, which pits them against all other players. If you kill them you get xp and they are forced into a 30 second+ respawn screen. After extracting the loot will be in your stash at any checkpoint or in the Base of Operations. 

The last main aspect of the game is Incursions, these are ""raid like"" encounters where you fight many named and elite enemies. This usually requires at least 2 players, but if you are good enough its possible to solo it. Matchmaking is very possible and in fact is encouraged. I don't have much else to say about the game if you want to know more about the game there is a youtuber who had amazing guilds on the division here is a video example on the Dark Zone and how its more skill then builds. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAn60lX8Stc

Graphics are nice.  Environmental conditions are nice though those who developed probably only thinks it snows in NYC during the winter holiday.  Rain doesn't exist.

Weapons are good.  Each have a different feel so you need to find which one works for you.

Help/tutorial is a joke.  The hints do not stay up long enough for you to read it entirely and you have a good chance of missing them since they pop up at some inappropriate times.

Trying to using consumables in combat is cumbersome in the middle of combat.  At the beginning or just before you initiate, no issue.

Missions do not scale properly.  Bad guys can spot you very quickly when you are behind cover or they know where you are at as they enter the combat area before they engage in combat with you.  Fighting overwhelming odds can be exhilarating but when those numbers are 10-14 at one time, it is too lopsided.  

The JTF npcs are more of hindrance than help.  They have ran in front of me and stood there blocking my line of sight or ducked behind cover where I was at and nudged me enough to throw off my aim or just put me out far enough to get hit by the bad guys.

Some environmental situations are horrible in third person.  Hard to see anything through a tree that has leaves on it during the winter (and I thought the leaves of trees in NYC fell off in the winter).

If you want to enjoy the game, play it with someone else, it might improve the enjoyment but it is not that enjoyable playing this solo.

[b] Pros: [/b]
[b] + [/b] Very good story and alot of lore
[b] + [/b] Very good graphics for a game from 2016
[b] + [/b] Alot of replayability and grinding (After all the updates and DLC)
[b] + [/b] Good PVP, but requires alot of learning of the gear system to perform in PVP

[b] Cons: [/b]
[b] - [/b] Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype from E3
[b] - [/b] Not alot of players in lower tier (Since The Division 2 has released and have alot more players)
[b] - [/b] The GPS system in the game can be kinda ""buggy"" saying to go one way that is blocked or something is in the way so you have to find your own way.


[b] Summary: [/b]

Very solid game after a bad period during the release and the first half year. 
But it has a very good story and lore alot to dig in too.
The game has a very unique gear and weapon system for moding your weapons and gear to make a build perform to what you want. Now there is alot of replayability after alot of free updates and some DLCs.

[b] I highly recommend playing this game if you like lootershooters or third-person shooters. [/b]

Pros:
- good  weapon handling (it's fun to shoot, different guns handle differently)
- nice graphics
- interesting setting (many iconic NYC buildings are included and are part of missions)
- the story missions are well done; there is some variety and the scenery changes a lot, including very iconic buildings like the UN building or NY main station
- trying to level up your character, gear, and base is motivating; you always want to keep going

Cons:
- some missions are repetitive (especially the side missions and encounters, which you have to do to upgrade your base); the medical encounters are the worst where you have to find stuff without any direction in sometimes very large areas - frustrating! And it is the same thing every time!
- some people criticize the ""story"", but I don't agree - as you play the game you uncover things like the origin of the virus, background of the various fanctions etc. which is interesting - but I would have liked more (especially the videos are well done)",1595373740,1595373740,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The weapons feel great.  Sound design is on point.  Enemy NPC AI isn't too shabby, though their tactics really cause one to ask who the hell talked this poor sap into charging into a gun battle with an axe.  I don't really get a suicide-bomber vibe out of these gangs, and as a result, these melee fighters felt out of place.  The friendly NPC can be annoying.  It's like, ""Hey, civvy, here's an idea - you're walking upright.  Pick up a gun and get out there.  Or shut up.  I'm not particular as to which.  But stuff the fawning compliments.  I'm not your savior ...""  

Maybe I'm being to critical; the story thus far feels pretty engaging ...  and I should preface my criticism with this:  I only played solo, though I do realize it is 'geared' towards co-op.  

But there are little things about this game that are so bloody [i]stupid[/i].  The enemies are still bullet sponges, though to a less extent than at first release, as I understand.  The whole gameplay aspect of these mindless morons charging at you in a gun battle with a bat, absorbing shot after shot as they charge.   [i]Stupid[/i].   There are maybe five types of ""encounters"" or ""Side missions"", and they basically mimic each other:  Fight for an objective, take objective and perform some game mechanic with the environment (Place supplies in storage, fix comms at location X, gather virus data, etc), then defend said objective for X number of minutes.  Rinse and repeat.  Once you've taken a couple of sectors, the only difference with upper levels, as far as I can tell, is the number of bullets the enemies can take.  Weapons barely scale with the enemies I was facing, so every encounter outside of the random 2-3 enemies on the streets, were a BLOODY CHORE to deal with. 
No thanks.

Didn't bother much with the Dark Zone.  My few adventures in, I only encountered NPC and always seemed outgunned and way under in hitpoints.

Saving loadouts overtop other loadouts, because no matter what loadout you were working on, when you overwrite that loadout, your always back on the alpha loadout unless you re-selected the one you were working on.  I quit this game on level 15, almost halfway content wise, after having accidentally saved yet another Bravo or Charlie loadout over my Alpha.  The whole inventory and skill system is cumbersome as all hell, and you know what?  I just don't care enough anymore to fix them again.  

More often than not I'm cursing at the shear absurdity of the situations Ubisoft built into this game, so the thought of putting effort back into reassembling my overwritten loadout so I can .. do what?  Hate it some more?  If the weapon is truly scaling to the character level, then enemies that can survive two 7.62mm rounds to the head should be a rare thing, not the average, no matter what the level.

Firefights were difficult in that often the player character would get stuck on walls.  You get this grenade indicator casting a red shadow all over you as it ticks off, and your character is banging the wall as you try to move out of cover to another location.  Wow, what a cool feature.

It's too bad.  Infuriating UI and, at times, absurd enemies made this game more irritation than fun, and me all the more irritated that I had to deal with easily fixable nonsense to enjoy the fantastic environment.   I cannot in good conscience recommend it.  Gonna try Div2.  I hear they fixed a lot of these things, and I got the game dirt cheap.

Set in fallen NYC after pandemic of mysterious virus. Despite the fact it is mainly co-op shooter, I am not into online aspects of the game at all. As a single-player experience it is still fairly good, though.
In-game menus are nicely crafted, but they are not the most convenient ones and unfortunately you need to use them a lot, since the game is throwing stuff on you constantly and an equipment upgrading is a key to survival. 
I love the way the movement of the player was designed. I love the atmosphere the game creates. I dislike bullet sponginess of enemies, which breaks realism and sometimes deprives gunfights of fun. But the biggest disadvantage of Division, in my opinion, is its placement in the loot shooter category, whereas it would be an incredible chance to build a RPG on game’s assets. Maybe one day…

You are gonna come across rogue agents(first wave agents and aaron keener) in the story and pvp zone.

Pros :
+Noice soundtracks (especially west side pier battle ones and precinct siege)
+Loads of character customizations
+High Tech Gadgets
+Snow (Man it really is damn good to immerse myself in the game)
+Atmospheric Surroundings
+Dialogues of enemies (especially rikers dialogue ""fookin idiot"" I love the way how it is to be said by them)
+Aaron keener (Rogue agent and underrated villian but noice personality)
+Loads of customizations for guns and gadgets too ( you can make any builds out of it)
+ 4 players can be played together (including you)
+AIs are smart (They can flank you and can use tactics to fook you up)
+Incursions and some hardcore legendary missions (these ones are tough but you will need to coordinate with your teammates to complete)
+Cover based tactical shooter (You cant just shoot em up by just aiming at their heads and out of cover)
+Fast travel
+Hunters (First wave agents or rogue agents whose outfits are fookin awesome.They look like modern military killers)
+Global events (These are the events which are only for limited time and can be occured again after a few months or so.In these events there are some modifiers on a mission in which you will have to grind for points in order to get yourself a reward.There are some exclusive rewards for completing)
+Masks ( I love goddamn masks because they make me look like a goddamn scary character and heroic thats why I envy hunters)

Cons :
-PVP is fooked up Dark zone( hackers and end game players are everywhere and some of the best gears can be looted in there)
-Bullet sponges ( enemies pve enemies are bullet sponges because massive fooked it up this game. you will have to shoot too many times to kill an enemy especially in higher level difficulties)
-Server problems (Sometimes there's a server problem like delta error)
-In order to learn story you will have to get collectibles ( or you can just watch in youtube)
-Builds are too much of the work (RNG can fook up your builds. I mean you will have to grind for the gears for which to make yourself a build and its too much of the hassle because RNG is shite)
-There are less players playin the game (Mostly they are playin end game contents)
-No vehicles ( You will have to rely on your running to get to the area you wanted to go)
-No melee weapons (Only hunters have it. They are brutal and cruel)
-Bugs ( There are some bugs one example is when you die and when other player revives you it just doesnt register)
-This game is mainly for cooperating and coordination (Missions are designed in such a way that it can be only done in with the help of teammates. Still there are some youtubers who did it in solo)
-No stealth

Still this game is one of my favourites because I mainly did go for storyline especially aaron keener( his story is continued in tom clancy the disappointment 2). It was the first project of massive ( they are mainly known for strategy games) but ubishit just threw it on their faces thats why the game is such in shitty condition right now.",1594447544,1594447544,True,16,1,0.607851266860961914,1,True,False,False

First few hours might be bullet sponge annoyance, but once you have better gear, the game starts flying and you would not realize you have spent hours playing it. Once the main story is beaten, you can continue playing to grind for better gear. Unlike grinding in other game, here the grinding is actually fun. There is always so much things to do here.
I wish, there are more resistance maps. Resistance maps feels like Call of Duty Zombies and Survival, which I like. I wish you can dress with tactical gear without paying money. There is enough enemy variety to keep gameplay fresh and challenging. Daily and weekly mission is interesting enough to keep you playing. The bad thing about this game is the travel time. Although you can use Fast Travel, still I dont want spend time running to a mission destination.

I faced a lot of frame drops issues despite I tried many possible solutions from YouTube and another sources the issue persisted. 

I requested support from Ubisoft but they are trying to blame my hardware about this issue, but I have many demanding games like Shadow of Mordor, Project Cars, Max Payne 3 and others that runs smoother without issues with my actual hardware therefore I am requesting a total refund.

Take in mind the frame drops issue, and if you think I am the only one facing it I suggest you check in YouTube the tons of videos reporting this.

Update: After an enough amount of time searching for a solution, even I wrote to Ubisoft tech support but I got an empty answer. Finally I get the solution by myself, does not matter if the game request at least 8 GB of RAM, the sad news are that you need at least 12 GB (minimum), and totally recommended 16 GB. I think this is due to the huge data the game needs to load, in order to bring you the amazing New York city, screen elements and all the things that make this game an excellent game (in graphics terms).

Not [u]at all[/u] the epic open-world RPG experience they advertised it to be. Not. At. All.

[h1] Long Review Ahead [/h1]

First, and to get it out of the way, bugs and crashes are everywhere. There hasn't been a single session where I haven't had a CTD. Not THAT frequent, like others have experienced, but still there and annoying. Also, classic U-Play sh*tty ""Delta"" errors kicking you off the game for no reason. Classic U-Play issues - won't comment more on that.


[h1] The Problems [/h1]

[b][u]1. Character Creation:[/u][/b] Expect to see clones of your character EVERYWHERE. This is perhaps the MOST limited character creation I have seen in an RPG. Whether male or female, you get to choose between 5 preset faces, 5 hairstyles, a few ugly neck tattoos, and, worst of all, accessories. Yes, accessories. Instead of accessories (such as glasses) being in-game gear, they are considered a part of character creation. It's unbelievable how they made such a development decision. That means that if you choose any type of accessory for your character, for example sun-glasses, you have to stick with them forever. You can't take them off. Ugly face-paint included. It's simply ridiculous. (Don't be surprised if they ask you to pay for a character remake in the future).

[b][u]2. Missions:[/u][/b] Boring and repetitive. There are no more than 12 main missions lasting 15 minutes to 1 hour each to complete on hard, depending on the group. That's the real gameplay. Everything else advertised as ""side-missions"" is plain bull*shit. These side-missions are 4 missions recycling themselves all over the map. Worst part is that they are not exactly ""side"" since in order to level up and unlock abilities, you actually have to spam them. Also, they are the unimaginative missions you would expect and have seen in every RPG: rescue the hostages, activate the water supply, defend/hold the area, capture the stronghold. These recycle themselves all over the map and become a chore after finishing them for the second time. IF these unnecessary grinding missions didn't exist - the actual gameplay would be 5 hours tops with the Main Missions.

[b][u]3. AI and NPCs: [/u][/b] Disgusting. I have encountered 5 or maybe 6 different models of enemies throughout the whole game, all named Alex for some reason ([i]""They got/killed Alex!""[/i]). It's basically the usual hoodie/thug model, a stormtrooper model, and a fat boss model. Sometimes you see these weird snipers with a cape that came straight out of a Lord of the Rings movie. It's impossible to distinguish between the different enemy ""factions."" Only reason you can tell a Cleaner from one of the other guys [i](yes, that's how bad the story is: I don't even know their name)[/i] is the flamethrowers they have.
[b]-[/b]Civilian NPCs engaging in the same 3 behaviours (silly fighting betwen each other, limbing, coughing and dying) all over the map. Also they run like stupid in the middle of gun fights.
[b]-[/b]Store Clerks in the Base of Operations spamming ""Come closer"" ""I have the best deals"" all the time even when remotely close to them - simply annoying and shows how no testing went behind the game.

[b][u]4. Difficulty:[/u][/b] A joke. No real mechanics or skills needed to beat anything on hard since the game is a cheat on high difficulties. That is, enemies, other than being even more spongy, are also suicide-crazed shotgun wielders. They just charge at you from behind and 1-shot you without even seeing them (let's not forget the ridiculous spawning out of thin-air - especially in the Dark Zone). Further, you also get these annoying snipers poking their little spongy head behind cover. If you are found off-cover for 1 sec, you get insta killed out of nowhere, forcing you to spam in-and-out of cover between their shots in order to stay alive. Fights against sniper-bosses are an irritating 2-hour long peek-and-shoot game where being out of cover for an extra second means death. It goes like this: Enemy pokes head out quickly to shoot | you have a chance to shoot 2-3 bullets first that do almost no damage before being shot at | you return behind cover ASAP. If you don't, you die with 1 shot. And repeat for 1 and a half hours.

[b][u]5. Map:[/u][/b] Quite small. Taking under consideration that 1/3 of it is the Dark Zone, the rest is divided in small areas that only seem large because you are forced to jog/walk around the map. Copy-pasted apartment interiors/exteriors are all over the place. Every part on NY feels the same, however, overall [u]graphics:[/u] They are good for a 2016 title - ruined by a bad story.

[b][u]6. Story:[/u][/b] Boring, characterless, unmemorable, rushed, and confusing. Stuff don't make sense, although that's to be expected since you get spammed with all that information since the very beggining. [b]You walk around while getting audio feedback on what to do, then you somehow trigger another side-mission on the map and the old audio stops and a new character starts talking and telling you stuff. It's a huge confusion.[/b] No logic. Characters are all forgetable and generic. It's just rushed.

[b][u]6b. LITERALLY NO END GAME.[/u][/b] All you get is a daily mission that has you repeat a mission you've already done and endless grinding to do in the DZ to get slightly better gear. 

[b][u]7. Dark Zone: [/u][/b] As far as I can tell, the DZ punishes rogue agents so harshly that nobody actually goes rogue and kills others. Once I got jumped by 3 rogue agents, got behind cover and killed them all. All other instances were friendly/cautious people helping. Worst part about the DZ is how enemies spawn behind you out of nowhere, making a solo extraction almost impossible.

[b][u]8. Money milking: [/u][/b] Game is barely 2 weeks out and I just found out they are already selling clothing on the U-Play store for 4-GBP (5 euro?) each. And guess what. Gold Edition owners don't get sh*t for free. [u]EDIT[/u] - Pre-order people were screwed badly: All pre-order ""EXCLUSIVES"" are now given away for money to anyone. Way to go GreedSoft.

[b][u]9. The icing on the cake:[/u][/b] Since the release of the Closed Beta I expressed my negative opinions of the game on the Steam Forums. Long story short, I got banned by an Ubisoft moderator. After contacting Steam since it seemed like a hate-ban, a Steam representative actually investigated the issue and told me that he wouldn't have issued a ban since [u]I didn't[/u] violate any agreements, asking me to contact Ubisoft because he can't do anything about it. Of course, before contacting Ubisoft, I asked the Ubi-moderator in the appeal section as to what did I do wrong, never to get a reply for him, making me threaten him that I will contact Ubisoft if he keeps ignoring me. After I got no reply, I contacted Ubisoft and after days of waiting, they somehow reached and scolded the Ubisoft Steam Moderator who, in the end, let the ban remain as is. After the ban was over, I returned to the forums and asked a question, only to receive another ban for ""trolling"" from a 1 month old post regarding the Beta on the EXACT same thread he issued the last ban! So, he bans me RIGHT after the last ban ends again for a second time. Apparently, the guy got mad at me for contacting his employers and decided to ban me again, without replying in my second appeal and without explaining the reason, other than writing ""trolling"" as an excuse. If you are seeing this, this is why you are and always will be stuck in this dead-end job.


I can go on and on, but I am out of characters left. Forgettable, flawed, and mediocre.[b] It's clearly evident how ""The Division"" turned out to be just a really really good marketing job. Expected, since all we got until the very last minute were actor trailers, a limited Beta, and no actual gameplay footage. [/b]

By time i got to that point i was playing challenge and incursions solo and my co-op buddy struggled to even play hard lol.  It's a great game lots of weapons and stuff to collect and different build types for your char by time I got to 300hrs I had every armor set synergies sweet weapons had some really great setups. 

i was about to reinstall it (2-29-2020 last played 9-5-2019) and caught the division 2 on sale on ubisoft store for $2.99, so I said oh yea! I'll buy and play it now. I haven't played yet but soon literally just got it. This is a solid place for a new comer to start though ""The Division 1"". So buy it and sink some hours killing looters and gang bosses. i never liked the dark zone PvP stuff, I played it a little but i felt was just a gank fest not really my cup of tea. 

Some of you guys might like that sorta thing to each their own. Yes i highly recommend this version. IDK bout 2nd one yet we'll see. There is a reviewer on here some where says you might like this if you like ghost recon or splinter cell but it is nothing like either one of them not even the slightest in mechanics. It is more like ""mass effect's"" cover combat also the active combat skills. 

Char load outs, weapon stats and mechanics, mods, passive skill setups and types outfit system and account boundness of cosmetics remind me more like that of  the free to play game from trion called ""Defiance"". If you have ever played both games I mentioned, you'll see a huge resemblance to both. Definitely the Defiance resemblances.

Take note:
If you plan on just soloing, just get underground and maybe survival DLC. Personally, it wasn't what i was into. (the survival) I played underground the most and the other DLC contents are best for pvp. Outfits and weapon packs might not be worth it to you, just depends what type of person you are. 

You can't use the custom weapons end game (they are max level of 4 and can't be upgraded just special non changeable skinned weapons for noobs) you really only need 1 char in this game. (though 2+ help you collect division tech and phoenix credits more quickly, need this stuff to upgrade weapons at level 30) 1 char can do everything and any cosmetic item unlocked is account shared. 

DLC weapons only good till bout level 6 after that they are useless. You can loot weapons just as good and better as dlc weapons. DLC armor same deal. Some of the weapon skins you'll probably not use lol You'll find a lot better in game unless you just want to look like a fool with christmas wrapped guns..... The outfits themselves they alright, I use snow camo and urban camo a lot on my char to be more role play like, so get them if you want the cosmetic options. 

You'll unlock a lot in game regardless. I'd recommend them on sale, because it is just cosmetics wont change anything. The camo wont hide you to the AI or anyone in a PvP zone because you got a big a55 name over your head lol and AI once they spot you they hunt you down.

As I reached the end game the dookie hit the fan at mach 10. Solo play is out of the question. You will need other players to enjoy any of the end game features. Forget about the dark zone you will get mowed down by other players in groups of 4 so just lay down and die. Ubisoft alienated every solo player by shoving co-op down our throats. I was going to buy the division 2 then realized it's not single player and never was. Ubisoft is right up there with EA for being pure scum.

I came into [i]Tom Clancy’s The Division[/i] expecting a solid, open world third-person shooter with light RPG mechanics and some novel online functionality. I have gotten just that. Am I missing something here?

My first impressions: some of the most fluent cover shooting I've experienced since [i]Spec Ops: The Line[/i] and post-pandemic New York is as beautiful to wander as it is haunting, wonderfully immersive in its appropriate desolation.

[i]The Division[/i] is absolutely gorgeous to look at and surprisingly well-optimized out of the box; one of only three games out of hundreds I've been unable to max out on my current configuration, I average a solid 30 frames with a custom blend ranging between the high and ultra presets which, for me, is both impressive (for a two year-old notebook—ASUS ROG G750JZ) and appropriate given the technical depth presented here.

Character creation is OKAY. Not good, not bad, but OKAY. It's serviceable. Personally I don't find the player models anywhere near as ugly as people have made them out to be. If anything I find my agent to be rather adorable—an everyday woman on the job.

The plot is, for the most part, relatively unexplored and welcome territory for the medium. Storytelling, however, has been threadbare, so if that's a personal concern then this may not be the one you're looking for; [i]The Division[/i] is gameplay-centric to its core. I think most everyone will be impressed by the opening cinematic, though!

Really enjoying the original score, too; the menu and combat themes are perfectly fitting.

There's been much hot air over server issues. Let me put this into perspective: they were back up by the time my preload was finished unpacking, something nearly unprecedented for a game with significant online functionality.

Overall, [i]Tom Clancy’s The Division[/i] has been a fabulous addition to my Steam library, everything I wanted and then some. Is it a revolution in game design? Hardly, but for those of you with proper expectations in mind, I struggle to think of any genuine alternatives.",1457511346,1593564497,True,3,1,0.508211493492126465,0,True,False,False

- The Division is by far not only my favorite Tom Clancey's game, but also one of, if not my favorite single player game of all time. This game is not far all gamers, and i totally understand that, but that being said, I would like to go over the reasons I have such high praise for it. 

- The Division is a third person shooter, set in the futuristic world of New York, where a deadly virus has erupted causing mayhem and chaos throughout the city. You play as a Division agent, a first responder that deal with threats the the average civilian and tries to help with regaining order from a multitude of factions and different enemy groups. This game has a wide variety of different RPG elements such as skill trees, different class mods, and builds that can enhance certain playstyles. These aspects alone make the game very enjoyable for me, but there are a few other things that really sell it. 

- Can this game be bland at some times, yes. There is not a wide variety of different types of enemies, as well as most missions feeling quite linear, however the overall idea and look of the game is beyond breathtaking. I love being able to approach the game in any manor i want, you can go balls to the wall and just run into conflict, you can play it stealthy, you can use gadgets and manipulate the arenas to your advantage. This game does not offer much of a challenge, which i know can be a turn off for many players, but the atmosphere and customization that this glorious third person shooter offer, it is a movie like adventure with very solid gun play as well as an intriguing story. 

- I also very much appreciate the mulitplayer aspect of this game. Ubisoft could of really made this a single player game only (which is how i played the majority of it) but playing with friends is also a blast, and the dark zone is a very cool concept that gives the players an interesting challenge in an effort to get better gear for their personal kits.

PS - I have played the Division 2 as well, but it is not on steam so i can't write a review for that title. I do prefer the second game as i feel like they bumped up the difficulty as well as adding some new fun mechanics, and the updated graphics only enhance the experience for the player. I have more hours in 2 as well and love the DLCs that they keep pumping out.

Enemies are largely the same, except for their levels. Hit a wall of enemies too difficult to handle? Casually walk back through the streets to scoop up a few extra missions so you can come back and fight the exact same enemies you have been fighting, but with higher numbers.

There is nothing here that causes you to feel like you NEED to do anything differently. 
Sure they might have grenades to move you from cover, but you have a limitless healing box. The environment is almost NEVER an issue, presumably because sub zero temperatures mean nothing when you have a parka and a scarf.

When The Division first released way back in 2016 I was highly skeptical about whether it would be a game I would personally have an interest in. Visually it was amazing, but game play wise it looked very co-op heavy which I'm not a fan of. I held off buying until now, and have been very happy with this game so far! 

I only have a few hours at the time of typing this review, but I feel confident I can give an accurate impression on a game that I've been skeptical about for so long. First the pros: 

1.) There's a lot of content here. Lots of different activities and missions to sink your teeth into. 

2.) The graphics are top notch. Performance wise everything runs smoothly, I've yet to encounter any bugs or glitches. New York has never looked nicer, in a post apocalyptic sense at least (sorry Crysis 3).

3.) The controls are fantastic. A cover based shooter is never too complicated to play, but I found it very easy to jump into the game and learn the ropes very quickly. A complicated set of controls and game play sometimes turns me off playing a game.

4.) But what I'm most pleased about is the option to play alone and how it doesn't impact the PVE elements as much as I originally thought at pre-release. Co-op is seamless and players can drop in and out depending on what you prefer.

There is a story, but the game play definitely takes centre stage here. There's a lot of focus on completing missions and looting enemies and locations. It doesn't feel overdone, or repetitive so far.

Con-wise I can only find a few minor personal gripes:

1.) Scopes are not very effective. While other attachments genuinely add something to each weapon, the scopes barely make any difference to zoom/aim. Having a bigger difference between each of the scope types would make for more interesting combat.

2.) Killing every ""shady looking person"" doesn't feel very immersive as a Division agent. We're supposed to be protecting people and yet I feel like a murdering lunatic sometimes when I'm shooting at anyone who has a red enemy indicator above their head. It would be nice if we had the option to detain and or scare off looters/rioters. From an immersion standpoint at least.

Overall I'm very happy with The Division, and think it's a great game worth playing if you have any interest in RPG's or cover based shooters in general.

I'm actually downloading to play this game again after having spent over 500 hours in the Division 2, and I have to say, the first game has better features and gameplay all around. 

So I was one of those guys when this game came out that refused to play it.  ""Oh look, another microtransaction game from Ubi-Shat, imagine my shock.""  Well, let me set your mind at ease about the microtransactions in this title.  They are purely for cosmetic items and in absolutely no way affect the gameplay.  This is not a ""pay to win"" type microtransaction game.  

Glad we got that out of the way, so lets talk about the actual nuts and bolts of the game.

===================
GRAPHICS  10/10
===================
Amazing.  The maxed out graphics are stellar, and without a doubt, some of the best work I've seen in the genre, especially given that the title was cross developed for our console brothers.  It's getting to be more and more rare that a developer takes the time to allow us on the PC to harness the full potential of our hardware, especially on these cross platform titles.  New York City is lovingly rendered, in its glorious post apocalyptic splendor.  Everything down to the most minute details.

===================
GAMEPLAY 7/10
===================
Alright, so I have to admit that I really love this game so I'm probably being a bit generous with my ratings here.  However, I am going to tell you straight out that I knocked the rating down to a 7 when I originally wrote this section as a 9/10 based on the simple fact that the PVP is abhorently awful, and in some cases, it is forced upon you.  I have never appreciated games where I couldn't ""opt out"" of pvp and ""opt in"" when I wanted to do it.  Yeah, tell me about realism and all that nonsense, but I'm playing a video game.  If I wanted realism I'd just go hang out in the actual Bronx and get my permadeath there.  

To go into more detail, effectively you build your character to fullfil certain standard MMORPG roles, healer, tank, DPS.  And a 4th role, PVP humper.  I kid you not there is gear specifically designed to help you be a better greifer.  And while that may appeal to some, it effectively means that when you are in the ""Dark zone"" area as a PVE class trying to do the PVE content in that area you may very well find yourself being murdered and griefed by people with such friendly and clearly not getting off on it handles like ""ISmellYourFear18"" and ""CannibalFrank"".  Seriously though, there are a certain kind of people who do that sort of thing, and with Ubi balls deep into the development of other titles at the end of the lifespan of this game, there is virtually no enforcement of anti-cheat rules.  Without exaggeration here, if you see a person bypass the 10 second ""going rogue"" timer to instantly attack you from inside your own group, or see someone able to ""blink"" around the combat area, literally moving instantaneously and becoming an imposible to hit target, that's not even fun, that's just blatant cheating, and tends to drive people who might otherwise be interested in some casual PVP away.

That said however, the PVE content is a lot of fun, assuming you don't find yourself wandering around in the Dark Zone on a saturday afternoon, or any day during the summer break.  The insurrections are unique experiences which create a challenge, the missions themselves are interesting enough, the storylines and side missions you are to use to level up are creative and varied.  Some say that the game is a bullet sponge, and it can be.  The trick is to keep upgrading your gear and to not attempt challenges too far above said gear, or you're going to feel like you're trying to dig your way to china using only a broken spork while you chip away at those insane health bars.

===================
PERFORMANCE 10/10
===================
So this game will run on anything at least quasi-modern.  Got a 4th gen i5, with a 600 series Nvidia graphics card an 8GB of ram?  You can expect around 35 frames if you kill everything to minimum.  It's going to look like microwaved dog crap but it will run at a playable framerate, and you will be able to enjoy the game with your friends.  As mentioned in the above Graphics section, it scales dramatically between those minimum and maximum settings. 

With regard to bugs, I have not experienced a single crash in the insane amount of hours I have spent on this game.  

===================
FINAL THOUGHTS
===================
While at the time of this review the game is effectively dead, with most of the new players being ones who were pulled in an effort to get the perks you can attain for The Division 2, there are enough old guard still around to get content done, and even pugging isn't terrible when you do it during a Global Event, which happen every few weeks.  As you can find this game around the net for under 10 bucks, it's well worth the price of admission, and if you've been looking at the sequel, there are nifty things you can earn for your characters in that game at this point.

I generally enjoyed the game a lot just playing through the story missions and exploring the world (all maps 100% explored except Dark Zone). Some of the activities get a little repetitive but I still found it a lot of fun to explore every district and to see the sights. 

The game has some awesome ambience. UbiSoft did a great job on bringing the world to life. The graphics (4K ultra) still hold up to this day. There is an amazing level of detail in the world, NPCs who go by their own schedules, NPCs who comment on your mission (successes) and even small details in the environment like flocks of seagulls at the Hudson piers while the city center is populated by common pigeons.
I almost completely skipped the DZ, the gear grind and the DLC which is multiplayer/survival focused additional grind.

The game (which is ""meant to be"" played in coop, I guess) was actually quite challenging all the way up to level 30 and then it suddenly became a complete cakewalk when I could finally use those juicy high level items I got from a loot cache at the start of the game. However, in spite of always being a little over-leveled it was like playing a modern FPS on 'hard' up to level 30.

All in all I really enjoyed my 45 hours with the game and I'm looking forward to The Division 2 which I have already tested (beta, free weekend), bought and started a character but it will have to wait a bit as I need a change of scenery first.

P.S.: The technical stability (DX12) is a bit hit and miss. I had a few (maybe two or three) game sessions around mid game with quite a lot of crashes (once per hour or so) and then many prolonged game sessions towards the end with absolutely zero crashes.

Update

Pros:
• Great environment design (amount of 3D assets and varieties are huge)
• Strong atmosphere of post-pandemic world
• Amazing sound design

Cons:
• Bugs. Use DirectX 11 instead of DirectX 12 because game crashes after switching to other window.
• Game is basically dead without other players, so:
• Gameplay and balance:
Game not has been made with solo-play style in mind, and so in middle of the game is huge difficulty wall if you play alone. You need to farm levels and loot to progress, it quickly become almost as boring as washing dishes. And even with all of the efforts you made, you get almost instantly killed by spawning waves of mobs.
Only way to get around this is to grind, and gring, and grind, and grind. It's not fun.

I really like the atmosphere of this game, and amount of work that has been made to produce such a game is tremendous. Huge applause for team that made this game, but I cannot honestly recommend it to anyone.

TL;DR Better to save money to buy Division 2 as it has online players.",1591631924,1591980718,False,1,0,0.495412170886993408,0,True,False,False

Incredibly boring game all up, imo.
I got it for free through humble and I wish I could get a refund on the 3 hours I spent on this unoriginal, dog turd of a game.

well im gonna start by saying i actually liked this game. i played this almost entirley in coop and after a it was all patched up and everything, and tbh it was fine.

need i say more? 

(oh lol the enemies are bullet sponges sooo maybe keep dat in mind XD) 

its an okay game to kill the time, i wouldnt spend my hours grinding away considering its player base has dwindled and more importantly, THE DIVISION 2 IS OUT!!

After playing it for myself, I have to say that it is extremly entertaining and fun. I am new to this game, but I just had to write this review while the impression is fresh. I was lucky enough to find a friendly group of players that helped me to get started and it was a hell of a lot fun. I still have a lot to learn, I am still trying to understand some of the features but I do hope that this game will keep me entertained for at least 30 hours and since I paid only 9.99 euro instead od 49.99, I wouldn't be mad if it was any less. Overall, the game is fun, I like the concept, it is not difficult to get started and the graphics are stunning. There are some problems like clumsy stealth mechanics  but you get used to it. The Division is a game that I would recommend to anyone.

Update:
After playing The Division for 40 more hours I just wanted to update this review since I gained some experience in this game. 
For being one of the most controversial games of 2016, I was, and still am, amazed by how good this game is. It is easy to pick it up and you get the basic idea about it in a first few hours of gameplay but some game mechanics and ""secrets"" are scaterd throughout the game which keeps it interesting. Leveling system gives the player sense of accomplishment even after finishing the main story and getting ready for ""grind"" stage of the game. 
Graphics in this game, even on the lowest settings, are still pretty nice and the scenery of destroyed New York is pretty amazing. I've heard a lot of people saying that it get's boring and everything starts looking the same but it's the city that we're talking about, you can't make the impossible. 
Characters can sometimes feel empty and forced but there are enough good conversatins that make you forgive the rest.
Gameplay, as I mentioned in the beginning, is interesting even after finishing the main story since the game is practicly only beginning. Dark Zone, Underground (DLC), Search and Destroy, PvP and events are still waiting for you. Grinding part is also fun and can feel repetative sometimes but it remains fun even after 30+ hours. 

After all, I still highly recommend this experience to anyone willing to spend a bit more for the game from 2016 but I asure you, you won't feel sorry.",1530050296,1591531134,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was when the Dark Zone was the ""endgame content"" so of course I tossed it to the side. Luckily with the gold edition, I was guaranteed every DLC that would release for it, and I'm glad I did that.

The main story isn't that bad honestly, it's a situation that is wild enough to be fiction and realistic enough to wonder when it's going to happen. The gameplay itself actually takes a while if you have the people and are willing to actually play the game in more of a story driven way. I can't imagine there's too many people going into the Dark Zone anymore with the massive amount of scaling issues that Ubisoft never thought to look into, but for anyone that wants to actually enjoy the game the main missions are huge cinematic pieces, the side missions get grindy but have a knack for world building, and all the collectibles tell a story from someone's perspective.

The expansion packs are what really keep the game interesting though, they actually add some content after the game has been beat and it's all said and done, which really adds to the value of the experience you're actually investing money into. Overall, if you're here for a competitive shooter, you've come to the wrong spot. If you're willing to sit through dialog and learn how Manhattan could be brought to it's knees, welcome aboard.

Seriously though, I never played this game when it was first released. I have played The Division 2, and I bought this game recently as 'a prequel' to that just to understand the story and what I missed jumping straight to 2. And honestly, I love the atmosphere of this game so much better than 2. NYC gone to hell during Christmas! The weather effects, the lighting and the attention to detail of NYC is amazing. I actually found the building I worked in and the garage I park at in game.

So how do these two games compare and is the original game still worth getting?
The answer is yes.
The second game definitely improves on some of the aspects of the original, as well as adds more features and game-play. It seems the 2nd game is getting more of the love since they just released an expansion for it as well as moved to a seasonal 'Battle Pass' system in-game. And finding groups for the harder missions in 1 is a bit tough since I think most of the community has moved over to 2, which forces you to have to solo through most stuff, which is doable but rough sometimes.
BUT..
This game has more soul. Maybe because I'm a native NY'er, but D.C. ( which the 2nd game takes place in during the summer) can't compete with what they created in NYC during the winter. The 2nd games NYC expansion kinda fell short for me because I don't think it captured what they created in the first game.

I still recommend this game, the atmosphere they created is great. You really feel like your running through Manhattan.",1589990823,1589990823,True,2,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False

The single-player experience (story, detail of world models, atmosphere, music) is great. In addition, this is one of those games where there's no shortage of people on the internet gushing over the incredible amount of detail, and rightly so. The work put in is apparent and beautiful. The progression of rebuilding a base of operations to serve the remaining Manhattan public was a great choice of backdrop to tie the segmented nature of the main story together.
The AI can be buggy and strange, but it saved my ass (unsaved game time) in a major way once. Movement control can feel clunky, but after some time you'll likely not care [strike]due the quality of the experience,[/strike] exept sometimes during fights.

Regarding pvp, I saw two comments on [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/7merer/troll_rogues_in_dz/]reddit[/url] that I thought described it well:

[quote=person2][quote=person1]its almost as if the rogues lack the f**king balls or skill to actually go toe to toe with someone on par with them.[/quote]
I mean, yeah. That's why they are playing in the DZ rather than a real PVP game to begin with.[/quote]
[quote=person3]Or they like the mechanics of not knowing what to expect from any given encounter. The difference in ideology in goal for each player in the Dark Zone is part of what makes it one of the most unique things in any video game I've ever played.
And why I keep coming back.[/quote]

Playing casually-light grind, you can reach max level in a week or three where you can focus on gear sets and builds.


TLDR; Single player is a great cover-shooter-fps-rpg. PVP not focused on fair competition but rather increased unique interactions that foster strategy.

For PVP and 7 raids you still need at least 1-2 more people. But i found them as it still has lot of live players.
As for the salty reviews, yep all those guys are salty AF like after playing dark souls.
I mean Sure enemies are bullet sponges only in the point of game where you are just shooting named bosses and his elits. Named boss is suposed to have more than 5 bullets worth of HP. And if you use brain in building your gear you take down a named boss in like 10-30 bullets. Suuuuuuure if you go heroic difficulty that is made for challenge they have double HP but it is flashing in red on it just when you switch the difficulty.
I personaly did not have any crash in this game whatsoever. And i maxed the settings, but I usual have my drivers up to date, let my system check for corrupted files, and actualy pay attention to how my OS works. On that part go read the crashreports those salty guys claim they have problems with. What i seen is literaly questioning why are they still using PC.

And now to not sound as defender the cons.
The PVP multiplayer is literaly making you farm and min max gear. That is min maxed by pvp rewards for kills or if you can survive a bunch of screaming guys in voip rushing you from all sides. 
That thing should have been limited or something more then just giving you the ability to once in while scrounge around 1 by 1 supplies in pve zones to minmax your gear.
They made underground DLC availible to you too late. That should have been opened from like lvl 10 it is just bad to be integrated and not as a deep part of main base that many people do not even explore.

So to count it.
Pros- coop,pvp, longer than 1 hour storyline, Difficulty scaling by setting, load of stuff to do, good looking for its age.
cons- pvp 1v100+ possible, best parts of game are at the end and on the sidepaths, too many whining people who dont play attention.

So after 386 hours on Record, I mustered up the courage to finally write a review of Tom Clancy's: The Division and I, unfortunately, have to say No.

Please note this is mostly from personal experience and opinions.

Tom Clancy's: The Division is a very fun game, It has some really good RPG elements a relatively good amount of content and from the date of this review, It's still expanding with new content and patches being released.

It has very fun combat and shooting mechanics, a very good cover system a decent variety of skills and very entertaining PVP.
The new Incursions that have been recently are relatively entertaining and can prove a challenge but it can get really repetitive and annoyingly sometimes, it's also the best way to get some really good items now.
It was a very entertaining game for the most part, especially when you got a group of 4 friends with you.

However the game's story is completely unmemorable and outright boring as-well-as short, you can pretty much beat the main story and reach level 30 in about 8 hours.

The game has boring characters and barely any cutscenes explaining the story.

Most of the story is told by dialogue that comes on while playing the game and half the time you're trying to shoot enemies to even pay attention.

But the game's main issue that I had a hard time with is the stupid RNG system!
The best way to obtain strong weapons and armour is by crafting and ever since the latest Incursion DLC, crafting has been made slightly more difficult but added more and stronger crafting recipes.
They also made it so finding High-End items easier.
(Even though what you find tend to be complete Garbage.)
However, even though you can craft good items, you still have to pray for the game's Random Number Generator to give you an item with decent stats.

The game is grindy.
I placed nearly 386 hours in this, more than most of my friends and people I've met in the game and due to my bad Luck, I watched as those friends got lucky with Really good weapons and became superior than me, whilst no matter what I did I never had the same luck and fell behind.
I never felt like I was making progress no matter how hard I tried.

The game also has a severe problem with cheaters in the Dark Zone (PVP Area)
The game has no anti-cheat, You can use Cheat Engine and give yourself unlimited ammo and you'll never be caught unless you get reported or recorded and exposed and even then you'll only get a 3-day ban for your first offence.

The game is also riddled with bugs and glitches, though some have already been polished there are still a lot of nonsense going on.

In the Incursions there is a glitch which allows you to complete the challenging difficulty with ease and get the best possible loot.
The developers mentioned that people who exploited this glitch will receive a punishment.
Do I agree with this? No.
As someone who has done this glitch, the items I've obtained from this glitch were mediocre, to say the least, and even If I were to receive any punishment for this, I wouldn't care as I stopped playing the game anyway.

What I find strange is that when the game initially got released there was a glitch which would let you farm the same NPC over and over again ""The Bullet King""
When the glitch got fixed, nobody got punished, the developers admitted it was their fault and even made a joke about the glitched NPC.
Why are they punishing players for their mistakes now?

The developers need to fix their priorities.
Let's punish players for abusing a glitch which we didn't fix on our unpolished game, but let's not do anything about the hackers roaming wildly in the Dark Zone.

I like this game, however, it needs to be fixed, It needs to do a better job to deal with cheaters, it needs to be polished and most certainly needs changes.

At the moment, I don't recommend this game because of the current issues which ruin the experience.
However, there is still a whole year of content coming out soon and when they get released, chances are I will return to try the game out again and update my review.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 19th April 2020

It has been 4 years since the initial review of this game, it has had very little improvement.

I understand that The Division 2 was officially released as of last year, however, there are still plenty of people still purchasing and playing the original game.

The new features and expansions are incredibly dull and uninteresting, I was highly hopeful that this game, in particular, would've seen improvements and it did, but very few.

If you're still interested in anything related to Tom Clancy's: The Division, you might as well give this one a skip and go straight to the sequel.

Whilst a lot of the mechanics have not changed at all, it's a definite improvement in comparison to the first.",1461135520,1587231987,False,8,0,0.538399040699005127,0,True,False,False

In my opinion, this is a great game, i am quite enjoying the Resistance mode currently, and its fun to team up with a group of friends. 

Story View:
The story is good enough i mute my discord call to hear what the cinematics are saying, some of the missions can be a bit tedious, but overall it was pretty well done

World View:
Honestly, probably one of the best looking games ive had the pleasure to play. sure it got downgraded a bit from showcase at e3, but it runs quite nicely. The attention to small detail makes or breaks games, and this one, was done correctly 

Gunplay View:
Nothing much to say here, guns feel good, sound good, and look good. one or two weapons have ridiculous recoil, but nothing too unmanageable.

Cover Mechanics View:
EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE it ticks me off going into cover again when i dont want it to, but for the most part, I do enjoy the cover mechanics, the animations are pretty smooth. sometimes you climb up on top of cars instead of taking cover and die on top of a car :^)",1514253668,1587090466,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With an amount of time that I have ""Played"" (played meaning grinding and wising I could just shoot myself) I can say this game is just plain Horrible. Lets start with the story, its doesn't exist, the main idea you get is the fact its a virus that was man made, and use to spread. After that all the missions are just looking at factions and fighting them. Speaking of the factions, you got bandits, cleaners, rikers, and a PMC. You would assume each would act different, but nope, they all act the same minus the fact that they have different explosives on their back. Cleaners have explosive canisters on their back or hips, and use flames to clean, Rikers have bags and hip pouches that can explode, the bandits have bags that explode, and the PMC has ammo on the back that explode when shot enough, see the similarities? Gun play is ok, not amazing but not bad, and the cover to cover fighting is alright. The true problem with combat is the fact that staying above level on enemies at a normal pace will cause you to have an uphill battle. They can soak bullets up, but you can barely take one bump without your character falling over needing help. Youll need to be at least 4-5 levels above them to be able to fight them more easily. The base upgrading can be nice to get you new gadgets and perks, and even talents, each being useful (some better than others). Finally you got the Dark zone, being the most fun with it (as long as you have real gear.) the fighting feels fair, and the loot drops are much better than youll see normally. So at the end of the day if you want to grind in an unfair, and generic shooter, and you dont mind wanting to take a drill bit to your weenis, then please go on ahead and play this game, if you like not wasting your life away like I do then stay the hell away from this game.",1586506686,1586506686,False,3,0,0.5,2,True,False,False

The story lacks any kind of substance, the gunplay is average at best and just awful at worst, the enemies are the same after early levels and they just zone in on one player and ignore the other players, even if another player is directly next to them. The AI acts as either a Navy Seal, or a grandma playing CS:GO for the first time. Zero situational awareness

There are around 14 or so story missions and a large number of side missions. Unfortunately the direction Ubi chose for this game was quantity over quality. The side missions suck. Many of the side missions feel the same and do not add to the story or make you feel like what you did was actually worth it. The story and missions is a massive let down and makes this game a grind to play. 

The customization had potential, but almost any and all cosmetic items you find and loot are very dull colors. Throughout the entire game, I only found 4 items that were not a neutral color, and of the 4 items I did find, they were all very dark. The other few things I did enjoy about this game were the different upgrades you could make to the wings in the main safe house. You could unlock perks and upgrades to use during combat, but this is a pretty standard thing for games of this genre. Also the weapon modifications were somewhat cool, but they never really felt like they made much of a difference. 

I have yet to play the dark zone and I have very little interest to, but I have heard from some that the dark zone is pretty cool. 

Overall, this is a very meh to just plain bad game. At times it was decent, but most other times it was a chore. I really wouldn't recommend playing this. I'd give it a 3/10 in my opinion

The details, from signs to the accent of the voice acting is just wonderful. The idea itself is great, and with the current events the scenario is almost a prophecy.

The problem is the gameplay. It's neither a true single player game, nor is it a true MMO. You could play single, but the constant up-leveling forces you to upgrade and change your gear constantly. So you hunt for gear, with the best being in the PvP area of the game, which is separate from the one where the story progresses. So you get the push in the form of a not-so-subtle hint that you have to play multi-player PvE or PvP, the latter leading to a faster progression. If you don't, the game will become very grindy and somewhat repetitive.

The game itself is nice and interesting apart from the glitches and bugs. Even though I'm running on low settings, I see textures not loading properly in-game and sometimes inventory items not loading. The game is unplayable for me as even the enemies don't spawn until I'm very close to them and the game doesn't even let me sprint to cover when it happens. Another bug I found was the audio lagging. I don't hear enemy gunfire or grenades blowing up during a fight, and after the fight when everyone is dead and I'm looting the area then only I hear all those sounds. So terrible.

Edit at 28 hours:
So I tried to resolve above issues by trying several combinations of settings and managed to reduce the bugs by around 70%.

-Disabled VOIP in game settings

It is great. All this despite the fact that I do and want to play solo. Other players are just an annoyance and there is absolutely no reason this needs to be always online. 

It is a shame because the game is actually very fun as soon as you get past the very jarring experience of the enemies being complete bullet sponges, which looks and feels quite weird when everything else looks realistic. This is possible to get around somewhat by focusing on maximizing damage at the expense of health etc. 

Some other pros and cons:

Pros: 

- Extremely pretty graphics and environments with clutter and objects littering everywhere
- Very good and smooth animations
- Very intuitive, smooth and good traversal, something Ubisoft should have props for and perhaps they are the best in the field when it comes to this
- Fun, meaningful and useful upgrades and abilities
- The fun factor is quite high, the game is very fun to play overall
- Music is very scarce, but the little ambient music that kicks in sometimes in calm moments is really really good and gives a great sense of atmosphere. I usually mute all music in the Far Cry games so I wish they could take the sound design from here over to Far Cry.

Cons:

- Always online
- Other players running around like headless chickens (like in all games) with ugly name plates above their heads ruining immersion even more
- ""Global Events"" that add ridiculous overpowered modifiers that are impossible to turn off. You will just have to quit playing the days the events run if you don't want to play with the modifiers on, very good implementation that. 
- Some of the most idiotic ""design"" choices I have seen in a game. I am trying to solo the Incursion missions, which are extremely hard and granted made for several people, but I find it fun to try to do it myself and I did finish some, but one of them you need to push two buttons at the same time, which is impossible solo. So you can start the mission, but you can't finish it. Very good design there.
- Repeating lines and events for NPC:s making the world feel quite fake and like some kind of theater set
- Very bad map design and extremely annoying how it changes angle as you open or close it to disorient you even more
- Every bad guy seem to be named Alex for some reason
- There is like 5 different NPC faces, making them feel even more like clones and actors
- Quite heavy and icky vibes of forced diversity and ""strong womanz"" stuff, making the game feel even less realistic, believable and grounded in reality
- Very uneven and sometimes horrible voice acting and writing and attempts at ""humor"" that just feels quite pathetic. The game is quite uneven in many aspects to be honest, being completely fantastic in some areas (like the sense of detail in the environments and graphics) and feeling very rushed in others (like the repeating dialogue), almost like there is no single passionate director behind the game that is driving a coherent vision and not letting obvious huge flaws slip through in an otherwise insanely polished product, a problem that is quite common in many Ubisoft games and gives a vibe of a game that is ""factory made"" in some aspects. 
- Loot boxes
