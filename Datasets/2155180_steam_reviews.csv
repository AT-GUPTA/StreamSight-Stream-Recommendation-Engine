The game gives about 30-40 minutes of free building time, after this enemies start raiding your village without obstacles in endless waves. If you don't find the necessary raw materials (coal, iron, silver, limestone) before this, you have lost. A randomly generated map sometimes places these too far and there is not enough time to acquire them.

But game is practically over when you get the production chains in order. veteran soldiers and Fearnaughts produced. Nothing can stop you anymore and from now on you will slowly conquer the map for yourself for the next 5 hours.

So the whole game is either lost or won during the first hour.

I suggest that these monsters and thieves are either removed completely or their location is moved somewhere on the outskirts of the map. In their place, proper enemies who build their own cities and economy.

There's enough complexity in its design to make it interesting and fun.

Forester + Well = Woodcutter + Sawmill = 2 Types of Logs, 2 Types of Planks, Firewood, Excess conversion to Firewood etc
You have pathing, you have radius, sustainable food and wood but depleting ore/rock and forage/hunt, making a need to expand and trade.

The main premise of The Settlers is entirely missing from this game. If you want to compete/fight for territory and resources with rival kingdoms you won't find that here. Instead you have to trade with and befriend other Pagonian villages (that don't expand or fight). Once you clear out scattered camps of bandits, thieves, werewolves and sceptres on the island, the entire territory is yours to claim. At this point the game gets boring and after a couple of play-throughs you've seen it all. 

This game is a gentle, relaxing settlement builder/resource gatherer with basic combat and trade elements. Fine in it's own right but it doesn't live up to the expand and fight concept of the old Settlers and that's a huge shame. That said, it's early days and new features will arrive and if the developer adds combat with other villages I will amend this review. However, the road map and lore of the game suggests this won't happen.

So close but so far.

I need a special building to station people with jobs and another to train people for the job and yet another to make the equipment they'll need...no not FOR their job, that's another building entirely from the one that makes the stuff needed to be trained for the job...Come. On.

My most specialest memory of my short time was when I discovered that I can't even expand without a resource. No, not exploring, that's different and only REVEALS the map. I need to consume stone for ""border stones"" which my guards use to expand my territory that I can build and utilize in. WHAT!? I need to use a special resource just to claim territory!?

For a city-builder, even building is painful. Most games would have either a free-form building system or a grid-based one. This revolutionarily uses a road-based grid, so if I build a road I'll then have buildings clunkily snap to it. If I build a structure, the road (and the grid coming off of it) will clunkily snap to it. Just. Peak. Gaming.

I might be forgiving if I saw any redeeming qualities, but I genuinely don't. This is what I'd expect in an alpha level build where they devs are trying to see if their map generation works or the building system works as intended. As it stands, this is not a $30 product, early access or not. Add to that the fact that building and managing in this game are hopelessly boring and frustrating...I don't see how this can ever be good.

I never played The Settlers way back when, so I'm not on any rose-tinted nostalgia trips, here. This is a modern game. Not from the '90's or 2000's.  I find no worthwhile qualities in this product as a game. City-building was boring. Exploration was boring. Production was overly complicated and boring.

I mean, I guess it looks pretty enough and I like the music well enough. That's nowhere near enough to make up for what is essentially a complete lack of engaging gameplay.

Pioneers of Pagonia offers a nostalgic journey back to the days of classic Settlers games, complete with charming old-school vibes and some modern twists. Despite the game's undeniable potential, it's important to address some glaring issues, most notably the frustrating number of crashes that plague the experience.

First and foremost, Pioneers of Pagonia captures the essence of the beloved Settlers franchise, making it a delightful trip down memory lane for fans of the genre. The graphics are visually pleasing, featuring a delightful mix of intricate details and picturesque landscapes that immerse players in this new world. The inclusion of innovative road mechanics adds depth to the gameplay and enhances the overall experience.

However, one significant drawback is the alarming frequency of crashes. These crashes disrupt the gameplay to an extent that is beyond acceptable. While the game's core elements are promising, the constant interruptions can be a major source of frustration, undermining the enjoyment of the experience.

On the gameplay front, Pioneers of Pagonia falls short in terms of teaching players how to navigate its intricacies. The objectives function, intended to guide players through the learning process, unfortunately, falls flat in execution. It does not provide the necessary clarity or assistance to help newcomers grasp the game's mechanics effectively. This issue can deter players from fully immersing themselves in the world of Pagonia.

In conclusion, Pioneers of Pagonia is a game that successfully taps into the nostalgic charm of classic Settlers titles. It offers engaging graphics and intriguing road mechanics that enhance the overall experience. However, the frequent crashes and ineffective objectives system hinder the game's potential and can be a significant source of frustration for players. With some necessary updates and improvements, Pioneers of Pagonia could become a standout title in the genre.",1706372307,1706372307,True,3,0,0.519841313362121582,0,True,False,True

Settlers is one of the most-played games of my youth, so when I read about PoP, I had to try it. To my surprise, it works pretty well and stable on Arch Linux / Ryzen 7040 - I am 37hrs in and it did not crash once yet. The gameplay appears quite resource hungry and sluggish at times, though, given the rather simple game mechanics and graphics - so there seems to be quite a bit of optimization headroom.

All the basic resource cycles work well and intuitively, but as the hours pass, there are quite a few recognizable shortcomings that need to be adressed. To name a few examples:

 * a building type that requires a resource not yet present in the game
 * build marks on ground where no building can be set
 * Soldiers walk right through a fight of their faction and do not help, because they are en route to a different task
 * way too few Zoom steps
 * map generator sometimes generates impossible maps (enemies block resources that you need to fight them)
 * storage can not be linked to buildings directly

Overall the game seems to be made more for a relaxed, meditative way of playing (a bit like Dorfromantik) and less for constant action and juggling complex challenges. It lets you breathe and gives you enough time to sometimes just watch your little pioneers do their thing. 
Which I like, but I also realize that for many this might have been enough for a game in the 90s and today there are similarly priced competitors who offer a lot more complexity and possibilities in gameplay.

Don't waste your time. 
Its really a poor design. You can't control your units. they go kamikaze as soon as you create them, and cost you a lot of work to make them.
Guards are wondering around instead of ""GUARDING"" the spot you order to guard. 
You can have 100 bandits stealing breaking the whole town and the guard will be outside watching the sunrise.

Most of the units you cant control them and wont obey. 
Is consider a strategy game, you can't be Strategy if you can't lead nor move the pieces of the board. If you can't control at least they should follow the order/command.

These annoying creatures can force you to lose if they are spawned to close to your starting location and there is simply nothing you can do about it. Throwing more troops at them will only mean they grow even faster and the inevitable end comes faster rather than later. The only counterplay are fearnaught units which require silver. So, if the first silver deposit is blocked off by several werewolf camps, then you lose. It's that simple! Unfortunately, this happened to me on several occasions. Please fix this ASAP! Just moving the werewolf spawns a little bit further away from the starting point should be enough in most cases.

Now for the good: Pretty much everything else! The building mechanic is fun and organic, as soon as you've gotten used to it, there's a feeling of calmness in the entire game and the resource chains are very intuitive and just the right amount of complex.

You build up houses and places that will go get ore and make things. Also farms and other things to. 

You also send out your guys to go move the boundaries of your area. So you pretty much own this land to start but as you send your guys out to look and explore in new areas, they also more the boundary area further and further, allowing you to get more types of resources for your workers/buildings.

It is in Early Access and still needs more content but it is already super fun and worth spending time with. It is pretty much like a Sandbox game of Anno where you can do what you want and what pace you want.

Give it a try now or get it after more updates, either way you are in for a good time if you like city builders, settlers games or Anno games.

Vom Design her nicht ganz so optisch wuselig wie die Ubisoft Siedler, aber hey! Das Spiel ist um so vieles besser in Konzept und Umsetzung. Es gibt durchaus die eine oder andere Kritik, aber nichts, was zu einer weniger positiven Beurteilung führen könnte. Wir reden hier immerhin von Early Access, und bis zum Release kann und wird sich noch eine Menge tun. Dass es z.B. beim Speichern eines Spielstandes (noch) nicht die Möglichkeit gibt, einen Namen dafür zu vergeben, oder dass viele Gebäude sich relativ ähnlich sehen, und dass ich selber befreundeten Dörfern keinen Handel vorschlagen kann, sondern davon abhängig bin, was sie mir als Handel vorschlagen. Dem gegenüber stehen viele feine und gelungene Dinge, wie z.B. das Sichtbarmachen, welche Arbeiter und Träger gerade mit welchem Gebäude zu tun haben, welche Ressourcen und wo in Reichweite eines Gebäudes sind. Besonders gut finde ich, dass mir quasi alle Infos, die ich je brauchen könnte am oberen Bildschirmrand angezeigt werden. Die Anordnung ist gut durchdacht, platzsparend und konfigurierbar.

Die bisher bestehenden Wirtschaftskreisläufe und Abhängigkeiten machen Sinn (ich denke da vor allem an die Nahrungsversorgung); sie sind detailliert und liebevoll in Szene gesetzt, und sollen noch erweitert werden. Mir sind noch keine Bugs oder Unstimmigkeiten aufgefallen, und selbst als ich einmal spaßeshalber so wenig Träger hatte, dass praktisch nix mehr ging und das Spiel quasi zum Stillstand kam, konnte ich meine Siedlung noch retten. War mühsam und hat gedauert, aber es hat funktioniert. Das heißt, dass die Systeme untereinander gut abgestimmt sind und gut aufeinander reagieren. Siedeln macht einfach Spaß. Je nach Karte kann es auch mal ziemlich herausfordernd werden. Wer so wie ich seit vielen Jahrzehnten zur Entspannung siedelt, hat hier einen Volltreffer gefunden. Den Schwierigkeitsgrad kann man sich ziemlich detailliert einstellen, oder eine der vorgefertigten Karten spielen.

Man ist nicht allein auf der Insel - es gibt einheimische Pagonianer und Störenfriede. Die Einheimischen haben nichts gegen Dich als ankommenden Fremdling, sie bieten sogar Handelsmöglichkeiten an, für die Du aber erst mal ihr Vertrauen gewinnen musst. Die Störenfriede, naja, sie stören halt den Frieden (grins) und können ziemlich lästig werden, aber auch das kann je nach Belieben eingestellt werden. Apropos:

Es gibt auch eine Armee, die man aufbauen muss - mehr oder weniger, je nach Spieleinstellungen. Die Einheiten kann man nicht direkt anwählen, und gerade das macht das bisschen Kämpfen sehr entspannt, und vermutlich eher uninteressant für Spieler, die auf den Kampfaspekt nicht verzichten möchten. Die Gegner sind Diebe, Banditen oder eher magisch angehauchte Wesen, und alles was der Spieler beeinflussen kann ist, wen er in welcher Anzahl wohin schickt. Auf den Kampf selbst hat man keinen direkten Einfluss. Ich hoffe, das sich das nicht grundlegend ändern wird. Es gibt schon zu viele Spiele, bei denen das Aufbauen nur dem Zweck einer schnell zur Verfügung stehenden, schlagkräftigen Armee dient (siehe Ubisoft ...). Das kann durchaus auch mal Spaß machen, aber das ist halt nicht Siedeln, das ist dann Erobern oder sowas.

Die Hoffnungen, die wir Siedler-Fans in aller Welt hatten, als wir hörten, das Volker Wertich ein Siedler Spiel plant, die Enttäuschung, als er bei Ubisoft ausstieg und die allein es (meiner Meinung nach) dann verhunzt haben, und das glückliche Aufatmen, als Pagonia (noch im Early Access) erschien - das ist in meinem Fall eine Love-Story mit Happy End. Ich bin glücklich mit diesem Spiel, und wäre es auch, wenn es schon das fertige Endprodukt wäre ohne weitere Entwicklung. Aber - und das ist das Geile daran - die sind ja noch nicht fertig!

You play alone on every map.

There are no AI players. No human players. No second player to play against or with, AI or not.

Yes, really. There are NPC camps instead only.  NPC camps are one building with some mobs around. They don't expand or pose a real threat. When you kill all the mobs around a building, it disappears. There are different camps that need different approaches to get rid of them, but thats all there is.

Other towns that look like other players are just fake and sit there with a list of quests to fulfill by the player. If you do, you get their territory. But they don't have a working economy, they dont expand, they don't attack. Even the NPC camps ignore them. There is no real way to lose the game. You play on a blank map without competition just to fulfill some quests and kill some static mobs. The game was fun for a few games, but it killed replayability for me. After the tutorial games there is not more to experience.

Its completely different to the enemies of the old Settlers I + II games, which had AI players that would actually settle, create a working economy which you could try to disturb to dry them out and it would just work as expected. Nothing of that exists in PoP and it's not on the roadmap either. It might come later, but since it seems to be a task for many years to complete, I personally doubt it will ever be added.

So if you still want to buy the game: Buy it for the building part, nothing more.

The building part is alright, but incomplete in comparison to the original games. For example it's always just one island, no ships. There is not even a fishery yet. Some of this stuff might come with time in early access.

I, for one, don't recommend it at this state, especially not to people who search for a modern Settlers game. This is hyped for sympathy for the devs, which is understandable.",1702574365,1705196625,False,0,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,True

OK Luckyly I have an i7 Laptop with dedicated NVidia GPU that more than fulfills the minimum requrements.
The GTX 1070 Mobile is a bit close to minimum specs but the 16GB Ram and i7-8700 schould be more than enough to run it.
And it runs - at 1 fps - like a slideshow. Absolutely unplayable. 
I would like to reduce the resolution to someting like 1080p or 720p to increas the framerate - not possible on the game.
Reduce unneccisary reflections not possible.

There is definitely promise and the game, as devoid of challenge as it is...is fun enough to keep me entertained. But that lack of challenge makes everything you do kind of meaningless.

I think one of the big things that causes this issue is how many resources you start with on each map. It feels like way too much. You're never bottlenecked by resources in the early/mid game and it leads to not caring about how well you've done setting up your supplies later in the game. So you're constantly just plopping new buildings down because resources feel meaningless.

I'm giving the devs the benefit of the doubt on this one. It's fun ENOUGH for EA, but there definitely needs to be movement in the correct direction before this is a successful game.

I would recommend this game in its current state as I think it has a lot going for it and can only improve from here, but I would like to make the following suggestions for future game improvements:

- Sound & Music
It can be pretty barren at times and it's missing the vivid nature sounds of the Settlers games, and in general just needs more musical elements

- Environments & Pathing
It can be frustrating trying to lay out your settlements only for things to be derailed by some terrain that's slightly too high or awkwardly placed. It would be nice if the Quarrys could flatten that ground, or even some building that could make it so you can build on marshland etc. The same can be said with drawing paths/roads, I like that's it's far more flexible than Settlers but that has the downside of just making me want more flexibility! It would be nice to be able draw pleasant curves etc

- Larger Storehouses & Storage Overload
Currently once a building maxes out its production it comes to a halt. You can build small storage sheds nearby to offload that extra but the settlers will immediately rush out to fill it with anything they can, causing the classic Settler traffic jam where the Settlers just wait in giant lines to drop off their stock. This gets even more frustrating when you're playing on the larger map settings where you have longer roads with only one point of access. I would prefer if there a larger storehouse building in general that would act like a secondary settler ship (I know that can you restrict what goes into the storage sheds)

- Fisheries
Kind of puzzling that there's no fisheries, it would be great to have them in! I think it'd be cool to have them actually go out in boats as opposed the land fishing in Settlers, this would make it unique and be another resource sync to build boats etc, same for using up provisions

- Rafts & Water Roads
With procedural generation you get a lot of replayability and generally good maps, but sometimes you hit an awkward body of water that creates a frustrating road building experience. It would be nice to, just like Settlers, be able to produce water roads to ferry equipment and stocks across it

- Edit Modes in the UI
When destroying something you have to click on the building itself and then select destruct, I would prefer a destruct button in general so that I can break down multiple buildings at once rather than having to manually go into each building

- Combat
It exists, which is good, but I wish it had a bit more depth. It's not entirely clear how much more power your units get when you store wealth, or even which units are best suited to which tasks. I know this information exists in the forum but that's not in the game, and it really should be a tooltip! 

The only way you can make units attack other units is by setting their patrol mode to whatever you want to engage with, I like the extra freedom vs Settlers but I think it needs more iteration. 

Additionally there's no settlement combat, it's strictly bandits and monsters. I think it's missing that push to acquire lands and resources which you get when you fight against other settlements - it would also be nice to introduce more warfare mechanics such as catapults and so on

- Multiple Islands
It would be nice if the maps had multiple islands that require you to build a secondary settlement ship and corresponding harbor, just to give it additional variety. This could also be the driver for collecting rubys/emeralds, which currently can only be traded for

- Map Objectives
I like that there's some special objectives on the map such as building the Dragon Shrine or the Ligthouse etc, and I'm hoping that more get added over time. I do wish they had some passive bonus or something though, I love the designs but feel they could be more 'special'. The Dragon Shrine desperately needs some cool lighting or laterns that float around it for example

- Dungeon Delving
We have numerous special units such as Rangers and Fearnaughts, which are cool, but kind of lack purpose. Or, conversely if you read the forum meta, they have all the purpose and then soldiers have no purpose. I think soldiers should manage bandits and fighting other settlements, whereas Rangers should take monsters and Fearnuaghts should take on more etheral monsters such as the spectors etc. 

As part of this, considering we have an Adventures Guild, it would be interesting to have dungeons across the map that can be explored and take the Rangers/Fearnaughts out of use for a period of time to explore the dungeon and collect treasures such as Rubys/Emeralds/the unique items for trading. This would give the Adventures Guild more purpose and could act as quest provider

I played a lot of Settlers I, and Pioneers of Pagonia scratches that itch. This puts me in a biased position versus someone who did not play the earlier game. I am not comparing it to other recent games, rather, whether I am having fun with it.

At present, the game is in solid, playable state. There are features on the roadmap that cover missing pieces, and I expect that the developer can cover at least those roadmap features. They are not making promises about features that will not be met. The missing features are often things that were in Settlers I, or are needed for Pioneers. (E.g., gems are needed to craft magic weapons, and they only way to get them now is to get lucky trade offers. However, a roadmap update will bring gems, which allows for rebalancing of combat units.)

The economy works as expected, combat needs the greatest rebalancing. Right now, the game has a similar feel to Settlers I, where combat is not the focus, rather the focus is on balancing how much you move your economy to support your military. At present, there are only PVE enemies in camps (bandits, werewolves, etc.). These PVE enemies need some rebalancing in their behaviour so that there is pressure on the player to expand in an efficient fashion (with the level of pressure set by game map options). I obviously cannot be sure how the final product will end up, but rebalancing such enemies seems to be relatively straightforward - at least more straightforward than getting an AI player.

There is no PVP, but since I would not play it, that is not my concern.

Unfortunately can't recommend the game - i know it's not a settlers remake but it didn't grip me the way Settlers did. by the far the most interesting level was the first one and just understanding the economy chains. once you've done that, it's the same for every level you play afterwards

i'd have to echo some of the other comments here about lack of real progress or proper AI settlements. The bandids/thiefs are just plain irritating. there's no slow steady unlock progression. the levels feel empty. The other villagers are useless and let a load of enemies pass by them even through their camps despite them having stationery seemingly useless armies guarding them. 

the last level... took me 9 hours - it was a chore - the werewolves were ridiculous. the BOARS however are another level - there's so many of them even with 7 hunter camps solely hunting them they never felt to be depleted, constant respawn. they stop your villagers doing their job because they get scared. guards can't kill them. this puts the trading missions into a halt despite you having the items and enough traders - they just pick the item up, run into a boar, drop it, run back, rinse and repeat... really badly designed imo.

i'm not sure what the plan was here, i know it's early access but if they perhaps inject some kind of story campaign with a slow release of building or tech unlock where you feel you get better/more advanced each level i'd probably replay it, but currently the missions are soulless

At the moment the gameplay loops are rather simply, the balance is off and you can finish one city within one or two hours. But everything which makes a good settler game is there, and you can see what could be possible.

It is a ""real"" early access game. The idea is great, just the content isn't finished yet. If you look for a good settler game you might need to wait a year or two. If you want to support the developers you should go for it.

Was super excited to get it loving the art and what I imagined to be a potential story line about exploring the far reaches of a mystical land. Unfortunately, the game is a bit to early in early access to offer all of that. I will say that I played only about an hour and the Guidance track of the game so take what I say with that in mind. I may be harsh below, but that's because I'm hoping this game will eventually turn out to be as amazing as I HAD hoped it would be. 

The resource table is very busy and doesn't really lend itself to figuring out what the heck is going on. Are you getting new settlers? When? How many? Oh! You are actually making babies - who knew?! 

The missions are helpful but don't really give any sense of purpose. 

The buildings and world are pretty but you can only build on the grid like in City Skylines so you have to be mindful of that - it's not like other games where you can place freely. 

The music is great - no issues there, love that. Could use a better tutorial with a narrator, like the woman from the trailer. That could help with the missions - do one mission at a time instead of ALLLLL of them. Include a narrator and tie it to a purpose instead of just ""place 2 forester,"" do something like, ""your people have landed and are ready to begin building, they petition you for a lumber yard."" That whole aspect is missing. 

Explain why I need a guild hall please? and all the other related buildings? I got missions to build them but then they didn't function and no guide on how to make them function. Same with the lumber building - I ran out of foresters to accompany additional lumber buildings so it was like, ""oh well, I guess we're just cutting not planting here..."" If there were a way like in Frostpunk to order more specialized staff from the ship or a tutorial on how to make specialized staff from the Guild Hall that'd be great. I figured on the Guidance track that I would have gotten slow, deliberate tutorial for each building. 

Overall, my favorite things looking forward are the artwork, music and potential for story. That's why I still would recommend the game. If you don't mind convoluted guides and resource tools, you may be fine. It can be figured out if you take the time. I'm just not that kind of player. I need it explained to me.

I am always looking for that fabled settlement game - 
That is something more than a city planner not all janky with the RTS and my enjoyment of micromanaging is considered “medium”. 

This game works for me. It does not stress me out with micro and a scenario can be completed within several hours of play. Yes it plays like a 3-5 hour game not some megalithic time sink. I am still working through the pre-generated scenarios and honestly they are perfectly designed for training. They introduce new components and required strategy for progression. The objective / quest list is excellent guidance. 

I generated a random map/quest game and it was engaging. I did not think it would work so well. I rushed my settlement because I did not plan on finishing it. I wanted to see if the generator did meaningful things with the inputs that was requested. I will say the generator NAILED IT !

There are only a few key bindings commands that I use:
F - set target work location
R - send patrol to location and wait
Tab - cycle through selected building type
There are a few more but I don't roll like that.

I would like to do a CTRL-# on a building to save and toggle it. There are 3-5 buildings that need reasonable input management, There are some other inventory control QoL that I am in debate about. The game is so close to the balance that over automation of the production could break it. I am talking about build “limits” Vs. the current build “requirements”.

There are a few more key bindings but I just don't look to remove all the clicking. 

I play the game at normal speed for the first 2/3 and things develop well. Placement and planing can be challenging and enjoyable early and mid game. The accelerated late game speed speaks to the open end the game still has. I am grateful the development teem is sticking to a road map and  not a hurry up and fix. Or this game would feel rushed at this time. The game sets comfortable at the $30 point. If I paid $40 for this I would not be upset. I play mostly early access games and this is one that I feel is actually going to launch well for its janra. 

I am excited for this game. The combat system is not crazy and I don't play settlers games for crazy RTS. Combat is reasonably challenging and reasonably relevant. It will impede and affect your development while you work towards the game objective, not the other way around.

There is always more to say but it is cutting into my game time. The landing party is to large and grows to fast. I always have 300-1200 people walking around creating traffic jams. Yes traffic is relative in this game, something that is good and few get right.

- Max setting 
- No crashing
- No lag
- No Bugs (what I thought was a bug was a design thing that was over come - people traffic – 500 people wanting to sleep on the boat because I did not build housing)
- UI scale 80%

This is a promising 'Settlers' successor.  You act as resource manager for your community, laying out your town, allocating resources, creating soldiers and trading with neighbors. I played the friendliest campaign to get a feel for a casual 'cozy' play through. If you like resource management games, give this one a try. 

You have access to the entire building repertoire from the start, which is a little overwhelming if you're a newcomer.  Fortunately you have a list of objectives on the side of the screen to guide your efforts. The land is 3D, and you have to respect that you cannot build on cliffs or in the water, so one of the challenges is to fit buildings within the confines of the landscape you have available. You can edit key bindings so you can easily move about the land, and you can click on the mini map to jump to specific areas and tab through storage areas so you can see what you have. Across the top is a list of available resources that you can edit to your liking.

You send off explorers to map out unknown parts of the map, and set up guard towers to expand the borders of your land, and create various buildings to accomplish mission objectives.  The animations are quite cute, I really enjoyed the overall aesthetic - if the workers aren't busy and you zoom in, they'll wave at you to try to get your attention. The game is filled with adorable details like that.

Potential improvements (minor fixes):
- This version of the game could use some balancing. It seemed like I had a lot of workers available even if I didn't have a lot of housing and one tavern. That's great for a sandbox mode, but it's not particularly challenging.
- Artifact events should zoom to the location and really highlight what is found; in this version you click on the artifact event and you see an empty field because it has already been picked up, so I never even saw what it looked like (singing sword). 
- I'd like to be able to zoom out a little more.

Otherwise game play was pretty smooth and intuitive; I had no crashes or major issues on my system.

It's a great start for an early access game, and I hope they continue to develop it. Currently it doesn't have the same vibe as the older Settlers games. The buildings seem low-res compared to the map and people; like, they're a bit too cartoony. The military stuff feels... weird... especially with the different types of opponents, which require specific types of troops and weapons to fight them.

But as the game stands right now, there's not much content there. A single scenario takes a couple hours to complete and the only real loss condition is running out of resources which is pretty hard to do. 

You'll set up your basics then just try wait on your explorers and guards to explore and expand. Some maps will have enemies that you have to train soldiers to defeat but they're more like a temporary roadblock than a threat.

It feels like I'm playing with cheat codes.

You start with this massive ship with more citizens than I ever needed. Never once did I struggle for a resource. Basically I just slapped down buildings until I met objectives.

I hate when building that you can't build through trees. I would hope my builders would be able to cut them down to make room and nope, you have to build wood cutters and hope they cut the spots you want to place more.

The guards slowly expand your land, you also can't direct them where you'd like them to expand. You just hope they go in the direct you need for an objective.

It's a pretty game, but the UI is also confusing where some buildings are. Multiple buildings are spread through categories I don't think make sense. Military and crafters were one that come to mind.

I found no noticeable penalty for not having enough housing. No one seemed to care they were homeless.

-Platzierung von Gebäuden ist z.T. etwas nervig (wenn es wegen minimalem Platzmangel nicht geht, oder die Gebäude sich nicht gerade platzieren lassen.
-Start etwas zu ""einfach"", der Start ist schnell gemacht, das Mid-Game zieht sich dann aber.
-Es fehlen (noch) diverse Anzeigen zu Produktivität und Effizienz.

I had my doubts before but after playing it myself I am now certain. 
It just feels soulless to me instead of rekindling the ""Settlers 2"" fires. 

Here's my superficial list of what I didnt like during my ~2h of playtime:
- no missions, campaigns or otherwise man-made maps 
- you unlock everything from the start which is ok for later games, but it takes away the fun of finding things out yourself
- maps look mediocre at best, uninteresting at worst
- some of the buildings look like some designer should give them another look and make some changes because they look so bland
- with a road system like this you should be able to turn on some guides like angle snapping
- however, because of the way the roads work it feels less like Settlers and more like Anno, but Anno does everything else better
- some animations are sadly missing, like a gentle sway of your base ship in the water (right now it looks just like a prop)
- I was hoping they would bring back ships, even if it would just be superficial like in Settlers 2, but no, you are starting the maps with a ship that will never move on an island and thats it
- should have brought back the Settlers 2 notification sounds

some points to consider when starting out:
Be sure the road is complete - problem with storage/carriers if not ;
Be sure to put your forester down first, woodcutter's are faster than I expected;
Add your hunters, gathers, vegetable farms, then provisioner and tavern w/ tables very early;
Miners need the 'meals' provisioner provides before they start mining ore;
Add Crop farms for flour (bread) and flax (cloth) early -- needed for meals and storage
storage bins for farms, windmill, provisioner, mines, etc. products

Couple of things to suggest for possible inclusion: 
Smaller building footprints; 
ability to save and start new game with new saves;
ability to 'name' or describe saves;

It starts off enjoyable, allowing players to delve into the intricacies of the game mechanics. However, the food production chain appears somewhat convoluted, particularly with unnecessary food market stalls that currently only serve the tavern.

The enemies are well-designed, and strategising the best way to combat them adds an extra layer of fun. However, the indirect fight system presents a challenge when trying to prevent villagers from getting too close to the very strong werewolves too early in the game. This sometimes ruins a match. There is always some guard from a distant watchtower who decides it's time to expand the border right in front of the werewolves lair.

While entertaining initially, the game lacks long-term appeal due to the absence of a key element from the original version: competition with other settler populations for resources, expansion, and engaging in conflicts. Although the existing enemies are initially enjoyable, they become mundane and impersonal over time.

Trading with other villages proves dull, as it fails to contribute to growth and acts more as an end-game transport system for delivering artifacts to fulfill specific goals.

A lot of this game is really polished, so I occasionally have to remind myself that it is still Early Access when there are things that I may find have room for improvement or feel like a straight up oversight lol. I'm really excited to see where this game is at when it makes it to Gold and I purchased the game now because I want to help give feedback and contribute to a better experience.

Overall really enjoying my time playing this and really enjoying the music too.

With that said, if you aren't keen at playing a game while keeping an eye out for it's potential - I'd say wait. I see there are some people who expect gold in a Beta/Early Access state and have really unrealistic expectations.

I have to say the thing I'm the most excited for in the ~February 2024 update is the large storage option lol. So. Many. Smoll. Piles. Everywhere.

My first game or two I ran into a few snags since I was trying to accomplish certain objectives, but wasn't really sure where I was going wrong with my production chains. Admittedly I might have missed instructions somewhere, but... 
[olist]
[*][b]White Flags[/b] basically mean you need to take an action and/or there is an issue with production chain in some capacity. 
[*][b]Red flags[/b] are more critical white flag situations (i.e. can't work due to not having connected road or available resources). So, look for flags and know you need to take some sort of action.
[*][b]Builders will wait around on materials[/b]. Boy, was this a lesson I wish I learned faster lol. If you are missing a key component of your supply/production chain and find you need to build a key building but have no builders - pause production on buildings that you don't have all materials available for. Builders are bunch of slackers - just standing around waiting on materials when there are other projects they can start and fully complete lol.
[/olist]


Aside from what I'm seeing in their planned releases - I'm really hoping to see a few features coming:
[list]
[*] Would like to have a quick search to locate buildings easier,
[*] More use of the highlight ability could go a long way, with either building or selecting production chains to figure out where you're going wrong, etc. Especially when placing things like wells.
[*] UI is definitely clunky and feel there definitely can be a lot more simplicity added to it. Maybe making use of tabs (that can collapse instead of showing a permanent grid with some odd pre-selected options)
[*] More details on (combat) units.
[*] Add priority to work orders please! I would like to just ""set & forget"" a few buildings but it requires a lot of micromanaging to make sure they are producing what you need first.

It misses exactly what those games whole point was though. Great campaign, great story and nice combat. 
With the direction it seems to be going in, i'm not sure if i'd have bought it, and it's not worth the €25. 
Pick up Vikings of Valhalla if you want a procedural map colonizer with an identical game play every round. 

Maybe once the game gets out of early access some of the deficiencies will be alleviated, or perhaps a modding community can fix some things, but for me the deal breakers are:
Let me attack (and defend from) enemy villages.
Campaign with lots of missions. (at least like 20+ for the money this game costs)

Nice to have would be:
Some different cultures/factions with alternate play styles.
Perhaps some unit control.
Naval units?

Your much needed workers such as hunter and explorer are utterly oblivious to the enemy camp sites and so die. Resource gathering units such as mines will stop mining once full, this would be fine if the carriers ever came to collect the stock, pretty hit or miss whether they ever come to collect , so you waste valuable land space building storage that also never seems to be used and remains permanently full. Between lack of space, a forester who very much loves his work (3 woodcutter huts clearing a forest could not keep up with a single forester), local enemy camps slaughtering your people as they do not see the big tents in front of them, mines that stop producing, trading that is fairly random due to the laziness of the carriers, thieves that even when you place soldiers directly in front of them simply walk past and rob your camp of resources it dearly needs at the start. Massive buildings and small building space meaning you plonk thinks where you can fit them rather than where would make more sense. Exploring and extending borders would be the answer but most explorers are dead instantly due to previously mentioned blind to baddies syndrome and your guards are about as much use as a chocolate tea cozy.

Pro:
- Attention to detail is really nice. You can just watch the people going about their day. Nice stress relief after a long day :)
- Many different Unit types that do general or special things
- City building / Buildings feel really good

Con:
- Long term motivation could be a little bad since there is no PVP or something like enemy tribes. The only challenge currently is to fight NPC Camps of Bandits/Thieves/Werewulfs/Spectres 
- The start of the game can be challenging, but once you have wealth and better units you can steamroll over NPCs

- There is no campaign yet

- The UI is extremely chaotic and counterintuitive. Your global inventory is not collapsible, and you start each map with half of the stuff not visible. To make it visible, you have to click around 50 times, and in the process, the UI moves away from your mouse pointer. Consequently, you have to expand the element again. Doing this each round makes it extremely frustrating. Some elements even ovberlap and you have no option to collapse the different parts of it.

- There are no statistics. Such a game without live stats is only half the fun. I want to see what is produced in what amounts and globally identify what is missing and where I might have a bottleneck.

- The enemies are complete trash; there is no incentive to kill them. Their camps just disappear and leave you with a loss of soldiers and resources. You can reclaim the stuff that bandits and thieves stole from you, but that's it—no gain whatsoever, no reward for wasting your time.

- Werewolves are a complete joke. If you encounter them too late in the game, they will behave like replicators from Stargate and reproduce themselves infinitely. Even when you try to kill them with special units, they will launch spontaneous attacks on your territory. So, while you may kill 10 or 20 of them, some are running through your territory, biting dozens of villagers. When they return to their empty camp they quadruple their numbers instantly. And swallow all your combat units, whether they are fearnaughts or any other, and you just get overrun.

- The building system is extremely tedious, not fun, and frustrating. For example, you cannot copy a building's configuration. So, if you want to build 20 dedicated storages for wood, you have to place down 20 buildings, then click on them one by one, and set them up with two more clicks each. That is just insane. Since there is no warehouse-building, there are only tiny huts where you can store 64 items of one kind and thats it.

- The ""treasury"" building is a joke. It's a dedicated building to store valuables, but if you don't have a military building near it, binding your combat units permanently, it can happen that a thief steals an artifact (which is unique to the whole map) and carries it to the other side of the map—game over.

- Some buildings are just duplicates of the same function. Just make one farm type that can house different worker types (vegetable farmer or crop farmer). Maybe even introduce a basic farmer and an expert farmer so that the player has to do something to upgrade those units. The same applies to mining buildings. There are three different types of them, and those are not reusable or configurable. You just have to break them down when the resource is used up, then build another one to harvest a different resource nearby. This is not fun.

- There is no unit upgrade system, so no matter how many enemies your combat units kill, they do not gain experience. Also, unlike the original settlers, it is not possible to upgrade units in any way. They just feel like an extremely poorly implemented basic resource.

- The combats are round-based and exclusively one on one. That means your units will hit the enemy, then the enemy hits your unit, with the other 24 units just standing around and watching the fight. This feels awkward and looks wrong. At the very least, let the enemy rotate through a group of units.

- Units do not have a health bar, and there is no indicator if units are healing or hurt. When you create a game with a combat system, at least let the player know about the HP of their units. 

- Other factions are always just neutral, randomized, conquerable fixed outposts. They do not expand, cannot attack you, and the only way to get them out of your way is to befriend them and make them merge with you. The (luck based)  trading system is a joke too.

- Speaking of obstacles, the building system of the game is extremely frustrating. You plan out stuff, only to realize that one cosmetic pixel is missing to put down a building, even when it visually looks fine. There is landscape manipulation, but your diggers will not dig on your command; they can only dig if you place down a building. So, while there is landscape manipulation in the game, it's locked away from the player. Want to lower a hill to place a big farm on it? Nope, instead, every little slope becomes a no-build area, preventing you from using that land in any smart way. 

- There is water in the game, both in the sea around the island and in lakes on the island itself. You might think, ""Let's go catch some fish,"" but guess what? Nope! Water in this game is currently just an obstacle. You cannot fish, use boats, or collect water from it. There's no option for salt production on the coast for better nutrition. Essentially, you can just turn it off, and there is no difference — well, except for less frustration when building your base.

- There is a well in the game, but there is no measure of the moisture value of the grassland. You can just put it anywhere and call it a day. It's another shallow mechanic that feels like its just there to make it more tedious for the player.

- The military buildings in this game can be headache-inducing. You cannot tell units to stay inside; they will always chill outside. So, if something crosses their path, and it's the kind of units that attack on sight, they will do so, even if it means this attack calls in more enemy units and results in all of your combat units being killed in the end. Building up an army near an enemy camp and attacking with everything at once is not possible. Ctrl+clicking multiple buildings is not possible, and that just feels wrong.


- The minimap is absolutely useless. You don't see your units or enemies on it, there are no hints about jams in your way-system, and you don't even get visual notifications when you are under attack, instead you have ti click on the text notification to be teleported where the attack happend. It is just what the name says: a small map without any features whatsoever.

- talking about production mechanics, there is some thing like normal and higher priority treatment for every building, it would be way better if you can enter a weight number and thus create clever production chains, backup chains and a nicely balanced overall production of your base, cant be that hard to change it from 0-1 to 0-X right?

- What I also really didn't like is the max zoom-out level. On one hand, you can zoom in like a stalker and watch your units' faces, but on the other hand, zooming out is not possible. 

- The lack of information about what's going on on the screen is also frustrating. You can click on units that are doing something, but you won't get any properties of the unit like health, current task, destination, carried goods, etc. Nothing. Just the type of the unit, and that's it. Even dead units are not marked as dead; their ""tooltip"" stays the same.

I could extend the list indefinitely. This game feels like an early pre-alpha or demo, but certainly not a full-price early access game. It lacks content (generally not a problem for an early access game, but I am speaking of literally no content; it feels worse than a simple mobile game). It lacks interesting mechanics, a story, and basic accessibility features. The only thing it doesn't lack is PR that makes people who played The Settlers and The Settlers II and hoped for a proper remake buy this game and drown in frustration and disappointment after a couple of hours of playtime.

I will not touch this game for at least the next 12 months. Since the game is so poorly developed in its current state, it will take a lot of time to address the general issues. It is simply not fun in any way. There are Settlers II ports and remakes that feel way more like the original game than this could ever even try to.

Visually the game is great, and collision of your pop does encourages some thought around proximity of buildings
and pathing. It just gets dull very quickly, I don't know what else to say. The goals on a random map are just build a bunch of stuff and balance your economy, then keep expanding while dealing with annoying hostile creatures. 

Encountered no bugs, so that's an impressive note for an early access game. The amount of buildings in the game is already impressive, and the interaction between them is solid.  It's just that it doesn't build to anything like an epic final war against another civilisation that I've come to expect from games like Settlers 3. The best you can hope for is peacefully expanding by fulfilling trade deals - which is just a little unsatisfying for me. 

Will continue to follow development and will update the review if these are addressed.

EDIT: 

Mack over on Worth A Buy summed up my thoughts really well, to paraphrase:
""There are two types of city builders. There's the Settlers 3 and 4 types with the armies and all of the other stuff with attention to detail of buildings and micromanaging things. Then there's the Foundation and Banished, which are fighting against the elements, or you're just building up a nice colony. This falls into the latter...""

If building up your army and fighting it out was your favourite part of S3 and S4, this game just doesn't offer that experience.

THE BEST SETTLERS GAME EVER!!!

Now the details:
I play settlers from settlers 2 (1996). I've played all the titles except the first one.
It seems that the creator use settlers 2 most as an inspiration with some elements of 3 and 4 and many upgrades like more food types, more wood types, more ore types and everything with ""more""!!!

The evolution of the Settlers series after so many years with some good and some not so good titles, until the Pioneers of Pagonia was created is now at its best!

I've played Pioneers of Pagonia with an i5 and GT 1030 and I've got 30 fps in zoom and 25something in far view - completely playable in everything low settings.

I really enjoy the looks and playstyle of the game.
You can see every ressource, build pretty well, and its overall a really rounded game.

After 20 hours of playing i would wish and love if you can get them in the game.
I saw some things like the Fishing hut already and mining for gems, which i love.

Pls Add:

- Bridges, to cross lakes. make them cost wood for brides over lakes  and out of stone for crossing over the sea. or build some architect guild to enable higher tier buildings including brides, so lakes are still an obstacle early to midgame but atleast late game you can use them

- let roads soft lock in when in a 90 degree or in the same line as the road it is connected to.

- give the buildings some more leeway to be placed. 

- a priority system which building is the most important from atleast 1-3  because they prefer the buildings nearest to the ressource to deliver first, when you prio them both aswell.

- Let pagonians not be stuck in a traffic line because one of them is stuck, happened a few times already

- let builders not stand around afk, its really annoying to disable for example some storage, they are hard to click on and if you build 6 for example its already annoying to disable enable them
so it would be a big quality of life if the builder would go away in the ship or the nearest construction camp when no material is being delivered, so they can do other stuff.

- the markets are not getting delivered well, even when you have a lot of carries having nth to do or even priotize the markets

- yeah i would love fishing like a ressource like we are on an island? xD pls You can even install some traveling merchant ship for precious things like emerals when you got a ship haven, they can go to or you need to go to them with a ship and deal on the sea with them.

- let the rangers and guards spread more out on patrolling and atleast let a 2v1 happen its so silly when 9 ppl standing around wittnessing some  1v1 vs some trash bandits, use that when veteran soldiers aka knights fight each other because of their honor system.

- the advanced magic soldiers like heroic fearnaught are just for show and not practical without a mine for gems so pls make that more accessible

- Guards are pretty shitty, and soldiers have no real advantage compared to rangers, make them stronger. or the ranger and fearnaught meta will keep going. Soldiers are a waste of ressource.

- Pls let the stacks at armorsmiths be added by 3 and not 5
no job needs 5 tools, only 3 per job
so its a quality of life change if you use 3 stacks atleast for armorsmiths. 

- Pls use some ranged units like archers or let the rangers be ranged?  or give the guard turret the ability to fire arrows when rangers are inside.

- Pls give the ability to disable guards claiming seperatly, you only can stop producing border stones and wait till they run out currently, or you disable the guard turret, but the units go away then xD

- pls dont package coke in the provision bundle for the explorers anymore, they just ignore every bandit they run into and get killed

- pls let the marsh be more accessible to buildings, i understand its wet in the swamp / marsh but then let the builders build some wooden plank construction to place buildings on.

- give more descriptions on why you would need several kinds of veggies when you just can let pagonias reproduce with hunting lodge and some veggie farm where there is only cabbage and pumpking for some reason
that its based on where the different plants can grow based on the terrain,
but then atleast show which crop will grow best when you play the terrain where you hover it currently.

i forgot many things i guess, but these are some key points

i really adore the game and just would enjoy these points fixed :)

I respectfully disagree.

Let me illustrate a typical game to help prospective buyers understand why: [/h3]

[hr][/hr]

My dilapidated ship, cramped to the brim with desperate pioneers, arrives at a peaceful island: [b] Pagonia[/b]. A gem of nature, full of life. Soon the ship vomits voracious invaders ashore, starting my inevitable cancerous spread upon this unsuspecting host.

First, the untouched groves have to make place for my beachhead industry: Axes relentlessly chop into wood, turning ancient life into material to be used in forthcoming corruptions of nature. Sawmills ingest the dismembered trunks, cutting them up into uniform lengths stripped of any individuality. My pioneers haul all material through unnaturally rectangular streets, pushing like blood cells through the veins of some gargantuan organism.

Yet my spread is hindered. 
Only great stone towers that house my offensive complement of invaders can expand the borders of my Reich. The stone these land grabbers have to use is cut from boulders that will never provide shade and shelter for any animal again. My pickaxes make sure of that.

[i]Ravenous mouths cry out to be fed.[/i] 
I scan the biome for anything that moves, thus sealing its culinary fate. Swiftly, the arrows of my hunters, trained to indiscriminately kill with only one shot, will end the peaceful lives of defenseless rabbits, deer, and swine. Their roasted flesh stinks up the shore. My famished invaders shall be pacified for the moment. Labor continues.

It is not long until my designated spies lay their greedy eyes upon the first Pagonian natives: Paltry, emaciated, hooded creatures they are. Sometimes their hunger drives them closer, into my lair, to take what is not theirs. I already have hundreds of goods in my overflowing stores, but theft - [b] THEFT OF MY STUFF! [/b] - will not be tolerated. To put an end to this offence I have equipped some of my frontline units with torches that unmask these miserable impostors. The blazing Ranger Schutzstaffel takes back what is rightfully mine, and more. These filthy thieves have forsaken their right to live the moment they set foot on my soil. I do not care about their hunger or their needs. Justice will be done by my blades.

These blades come at a price, though. The metastasis that is my ever-expanding iron industry belches black soot and smoke, turning what was once luscious green into pitch black. Armorers maddeningly hammer away at chain mail and sturdy shields. Though defensive items, they are all to equip my offensive schemes: The second Pagonian natives, resisting more fiercely in their faraway camps, will be overrun by my ironclad mercenaries like the infesting cockroaches they are.

The third Pagonian natives, although docile, can not be eradicated by brute force. Their resource-rich land entices me, so I play their game of give and take: I give junk and in turn they let me take invaluable treasures. The longer I feign my part as an honorable trader, the more their suspicions melt away. They lower their defenses, finally wanting to shake hands on a mutual and collaborative future.
I shake their hands. The barrier is gone. I assimilate. Everything.
The natural, winding layout of their hamlet is an eyesore. It has to be bulldozed completely to make place for more efficient metastases. Their idyllic ancestral homes are exchanged for contaminating industries that corrupt the indigenous magic to produce even deadlier weapons.

Only when the last animal has been hunted down, the last tree felled, and the last natives obliterated or enslaved do I retire. Sweaty and exhausted, I now need to cleanse my body and my mind from this tainting experience.

[hr][/hr]

[h3] TL;DR: 9/10 game[/h3] if you can stomach its Machiavellian depravities.
Upcoming patches promise the ability to also murder aquatic life. This pleases me greatly.

It is a more easy-going game, there are no survival elements like in ""Banished"" or ""Frathers Frontiers"" and there is no population happiness like in the ""Anno"" series. 
There is a bit of military action going on, but against thiefs, bandits, and so on ...

The version you can play in Early Access is already very polished and offers a nice experience.
While you can settle peacefully you can also play maps with PVE content to fight bandits and different monsters (each with own characteristics). 

The artstyle is very nice and there is always something to see going on. 
I play using a framecap of 40fps on a radeon RX5700XT in 1440p. It runs very smooth and also the graphics card stays cool and quiet. 
I would not use FSR(1) as graphics get very blurry using any factor of resolution scaling. 

From my point of view some work needs to be done with the balancing of goods as it seems very easy to produce high amounts of food with no way to spend it all. 
That would not be a problem if the warehouses would have more space to store goods. 
I would suggest to have warehouses that could store unlimited supply like in ""The Settlers (1)"".

The gameplay is veeery chilled and relaxing based on my experience with the instructional map. If you ever played any economical city builder before like e.g. The Settlers, Anno or Highrise City, you will guess very quickly, which production line is required in which sequence. The look is appealing and the game behaves stable and robust (me playing this on Linux Suse Leap 15.5). Btw: I play the game with the default settings and turned off only VSync.

On the other hand:
1. Resources are all yet there as stones with different label only. This needs proper mines for e.g. coal and copper.
2. No break down animations when crushing a building.
3. Camera does not allow a more horizontal view when close to the ground, which would be nice for enjoying the 'wusel'-show.
4. The top menu of resources is more confusing than informative. An icon for opening a drop down list window would be more appreciated. In same way the window for mission objectives should be an icon only for viewing on demand.
5. The game does atm not allow any adjustment nor determination of the resolution. It's all just take it as you get it.
6. The fog looks strange sometimes like a bunch of flat textures banged together, which it may be indeed. A bit more fluent appearance of the fog would be nice.

Positives:
1. What i see here is a very nice start back to the roots of The Settlers' philosophy.
2. Watching the guards pushing border stones is absolutely adorable.
3. Listening into the crowds is fun. I play this in English and the first thing i heard was a guy shouting ""Guten Morgen zusammen!"". Since these people are multi-culture by skin, having a bit multi-culture in the crowds chatting is welcome.
4. Placing roads works fine and is a good extra challenge in planning the usage of space.
5. I love the idea of placing defined squares for farm land. So much better than the large wheat fields appearing everywhere in older versions of The Settlers.
6. Displaying on click the radius of a buildings impact is great and useful.

So there is some new stuff here, which is great. But it does not feel like a full game yet.

Just brainstorming:
A) How about different coloured churches, temples or mosques by factions - and once a religious building of different colour has been taken down, the factions can unit? Or a faction without any religious building is the only faction that can have peace with all neighbours - but its transporting peeps need more taverns?
B) How about rare natural disasters like a mountain breaking down crushing houses in a radius leaving rocks for mining before the area can be used for building again?
C) How about a trade system with neigbours allowing joined usage and maintenance of very expensive buildings like e.g. an Opera? (Such could a bonus feature for co-op matches against AI factions.)

Overall i find Highrise City atm a bit more entertaining, but in contrast to Highrise City, these Pioneers of Pagonia behave very stable and robust. I had zero crashes so far even while switching back and forth between game and music player.",1702952508,1702953196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Experienced Settlers players, especially of 1-4, will be delighted to see that Volter Wertich, has gone back to his roots, and is developing a game in the same strategic and logistical manner that the original Settlers games.

It is important to read the road map before buying or playing this game, so you are aware of when certain functions are destined to be introduced so that you avoid disappointment and making posts/reviews which clearly evidence that you did not research before purchase.

This is only the second game I have ever purchased in early access of the 141 games I own on Steam over the 20 years I have been using it since I purchased Half-Life 2.   I normally avoid doing it as I prefer to play a finished product.  For example, I even wait for Definitive Editions of Larian Studio products and prefer buying their games.  

I decided to purchase this one as I was so disappointed in Settlers New Allies and read an IGN interview they did with Volter Wertich on how he left Ubisoft as their vision of Settlers differed from his, and he wanted to back to the origins of the series and I wanted to support him in his endeavours on this game.

I did not intend to even play the game but caught on YouTube that the first scenario was open-ended so you could go through the current game mechanics.  So, I was intrigued and played it and it took me just over 5 hours to see how the mechanics were developing for the finished product.

I was pleasantly surprised by how complete a substantial proportion of the basic game mechanics were.  And even more surprised that I encountered no bugs, glitches or crashes and the game ran very smoothly on my ten-year-old PC.  

But the most surprising thing was how relaxingly wholesome fun it was, and it truly does harken back to the good old days of Settlers 1-4.  Not like the click fest and zooming around all over the map of the more modern versions.  I hope they keep to this format as development continues.

The game has significant potential, and I will be revisiting my review in February 2024 after the economy update is released with the production statistics included.  Because I had so much fun, I will be playing the rest of the included scenarios in the coming weeks.

I do recommend supporting Volter and his team as the game is genuine fun as it is now, and the future looks good for a traditional relaxing logistics game of Settlers Past, rather than the hectic click fest of more recent ones.

If you make friendship with your neighbours and do some trading you can take them over like a little present. That's it. No effort to engage their towers, etc. Mostly they don't even have them.

The positives:
- Many resources you have to manage and combine in resource chains
- Beautiful artstyle
- A real settlers vibe
- the pathing is really good most of the times
- genuinly intuitive and fun gameplay

The negatives:
- the fighting system is not transparent. You cant  see what makes one unit better/different to the other
- Werewolves are way too strong. You go all in with your troops, maybe kill 40 if you are lucky until all your units are dead,  with the little twist that all your dead units  becoming  werewolves  instantly and you are basically where you started with 40 werewolves, pretty frustrating
3 things would fix that: 
1. Range units/towers: if I could snipe the werewolves from a safe distance, no new werewolfs would appear
2. Not every dead person  becomes a werewolf, let  there be a  50% chance of  them becoming a werewolf and  it  would be fine

# Pacing
After securing a few basic resources you can simply build most buildings. The choice what you do first feels almost meaningless. For me this lead to a feeling of aimlessness rather than freedom. After getting access to cement and with that wooden cogs the game almost played itself.

# Spacing
Most buildings have a huge range and are efficient enough to supply a large settlement with very few copies. This allows for a lot of freedom when setting up buildings, to the point where it feels irrelevant where you place your buildings.
There is one exception: residences, tavern and the market need to be build close together. A great system on paper, but with the current balance and lack of UI elements the system feels opaque and unfinished.

# Placing Buildings
The placement system is one of the more frustrating elements of the game. I frequently had to raze buildings in order to connect roads or the other way around. Its tricky to place roads in such a way that they allow for buildings to perfectly fit next to them. I like the idea of not adhering to a rectangular grid, but the way it is now... I wish I had a proper grid. 
 
# Long Term Motivation
I applaud the choice to move away from a PvP centric formular, but with neither PvP nor a campaign I struggle to see the long term motivation. Playing a couple of rounds in order to explore the buildings, units, obstacles and factions is fun enough, but for now there is little reason to return once you've seen everything once or twice.

# Resources
There are a lot of resources, or are there? Take Pumpkins or Cabbages for example. The same building will supply both and so far I havnt seen any reason to build more than one veg farm. The same can be said about mushrooms and berries or the different types of meat. To a lesser degree even about the types of wood. The variety of resources is a great concept but until it is developed further to make it something you have to actively consider in some way if feels a bit half baked.
I would also enjoy more complex resource cycles akin to bread.

# Starting resources
The maps I have tried were very generous on starting resources. This makes mistakes less punishing, which is nice, but they are so plentyful that a significant part of the match can be played with them rather than setting up resource cycles.

# UI
There is a lot of key information that is currently not displayed in game: what are the differences between the available military units? What ingredients are needed for the different types of meals? How many buildings of Type A can fully supply a building of type B? Any kind of productivity displays.

# Objectives
There are quite a few objectives, which is fun, but many dont do anything other than contributing to winning the match. It would be great if, say the board monument, would actually have some kind of effect once finished.

That is quite the laundry list of complaints, but luckily most are issues that can be addressed by balance, polish and minor feature tweaks. I'm confident that a lot of them will be addressed over the course of the EA phase. The aspect I'm both most concerned and curious to observe is how long term motivation and game modes will develop.",1702876022,1702876022,True,66,3,0.871460318565368652,0,True,False,True

There was no real challenge, and the only requirement was to place a few buildings in the correct order for the map to be easily finished.

That has to be said. Settler games were about logistics, optimisation and war. This game has none of those qualities.

The game is still pretty decent though, chill strategic adventure game with focus on... Well actually the games biggest weakness right now is that there are no real focus. Your objective is build your village to point where you can do objectives for neighbors while minimizing damage seemingly random enemy camps do to your village. And eventually destroy said enemy camps, not because you have to but because the notifications for those camps coming to steal your stuff is annoying. All of this is hardly a challenge, but takes time. There however is no penalty for taking too long, like there is no penalty for overproducing or not even penalty for underproducing. Everything just takes more or less time depending on how well you manage to estimate your amount of resources at your disposal at any point of game. But nothing really stops you for getting in the end, so you have no need to worry.

So for anyone looking for challenge or game focusing on logistics, this is not the game you are looking for. Anyone looking for chill village builder for 20 hours, this may be for you, though there are probably better options out there. Art is nice.

EDIT, after reading what other have written as reviews, I'm convinced that quite big chunck of ""thumbs up"" are not legit reviews. Either those players have not played Settlers games or they are lying. Because this is so much not like those games in any other way than by appearance of first two minutes.

As someone who dearly loves the old games and wants them to return. I really hope this improves, and I feel that the current road-map will not be enough to achieve this.
The game had the potential to return some really interesting mechanics to the genre, but it doesn't quiet yet.

The lows:

Combat: No enemy city building, no multiplayer pvp. No interesting magic that settlers 3 and 4 had. No real threat of loosing territory(that I've seen so far). I hope they take the current neutral ai that can join you and improve on it to pose as a threat to you.

Multiple playthroughs: I don't feel there is much to differentiate, where settlers 4- had multiple distinct civilizations, this doesn't. Where settlers 5+ or other city builders had very varying environments this only has a minimal amount of it. I can see this improving if we had a scenario editor.

No campaign: Considering its a small team I understand why there is none, but the old games had some truly amazing campaigns that I still enjoy playing. 

The highs:

City building: It's definitely been improved on compared to the old titles. Bigger production chains, cities skylines road traffic, and cute graphics.  The tool smithy feels nostalgic and I'm fighting against the trees for building space like in the old days.

Optimization: With good graphics this game runs really well, and I have yet to meet any bugs. Its clear that any new features will be delivered well.",1702834040,1702834040,False,5,2,0.451896935701370239,0,True,False,True

*Snapping. You build a road. You try to build something. The building will snap with it's connection point facing the opposite direction to the road. Or you build a farm, and want to build fields around it. The fields can't just be painted, they seem to have to be placed individually. Then each field will be rotated slightly differently so you end up with a patchwork 

*Guard Towers. This game has successfully defeated defence tower spamming. Bandits, thieves and assorted varmints will kill your builders and Guard Tower just doesn't care. You have guards, but they're usually too busy planting rocks  to notice their mates getting killed. If you make soldiers instead of guards, they might fight back. But being noble, they'll fight and die 1 at a time rather than dogpiling on the bad guys. It also doesn't seem possible to rubber band select a bunch of idle solders and order them to go smack stuff, because that would be too easy.

*Micromanagement. This one's nailed. Soldier might need a sword & board. So queue up a bunch of soldiers. Then don't forget to queue up a bunch of swords, shields, armour etc because you have to do that manually. Nothing as simple as generating the orders, or being able to set a production limit, ie keep 20 swords in stock. Swords and armour also evaporate on loss, or are soul-bound to their original owners because when your soldiers die, and they'll do that a lot, the gear is gone.

So far, so frustrating. Sure, it's early access and some stuff has been fixed since the demo. We can now rotate buildings with z/x instead of trying to use the mouse. But a lot more work needed.",1702743822,1702743822,False,47,3,0.663411140441894531,0,True,False,True

Not so good; it is not like Settlers 1-4.

Miss the direct creation of soldiers and then to move them around in a pack. You just can set a location.
Miss things like ships, warehouses and donkeys to make it great.
Also there are no bow man, so defending is just wasting your soldiers; kinda stupid since it is random, if unit wins or looses.
Fantasy enemies like ghosts and werwulfs are just not required; at least the wulfs are op.

The gameloop isn't satisfying, the conditions of making things work aren't communicated clearly to the player, things just trot along some things work and some things don't and you change stuff and sometimes it works better.

Surviving the Aftermath has a tech tree and you can prioritize jobs, build roads, its a entertaining city builder with a theme and some stakes.  Strong recommend that as a city builder with a simple worldmap glued on.  Perhaps my mistake is that this is a Early Access Game, and it looks nice and provides like 5 minutes of gameplay, but I expected more game to be put into the game.  The gameloop is less satisfying than playing Solitaire.  The advertisements say there are like forty resources, but apparently they are including different crop type choices (which are choices which don't matter). There is hard wood and soft wood, copper, iron, coal, limestone.  Build wood gears then build a windmill then build a bakery, build a provisioner that turns wood into rations, build a tavern near a food stall that also needs to be near food stall well, build houses near the tavern and tavern tables, and the houses will have babies if they have food.  So like there is some interaction between buildings but its not crazy new city builder territory.  I wonder if the aesthetic is supposed to be silly and relaxing and if you could have more dwarf fortress like emergent game play with some degree of randomness, but then as a game design, that needs to be communicated to the player.  (oh this map mode has bandits, and the bandits fight with rng combat!  mmmk,) so its a simplified not quite RTS thing that i just spam soldier creation while wondering what rations do while my production mass produces, and why do so many people sleep on the boat?  if i delete a military camp will the soldiers go to another camp or go to the boat to be retrained?

That is the possibility of 2 settlements fighting each other.
Every game in old settlers went like:
- start the game
- build some supply chains
- feel the thrill of seeing the opposing settlement thinking that they are gonna kill you
- destroy them, gaining new materials in progress of destroying or be destroyed

Pioneers lack the last two steps that I've always loved.
Now, the game gives pleasure until you have some supply chains and see another settlement.
Interactions with it are not rewarding, you don't get territory or supplies.
You have to produce some specific supplies for the sake of giving them away.
What's the point?
Killing is the fun part that we didn't get.

PoP finds a bit its own niche in the genre. It places a heavy focus on building up the economy with a good level of complexity. Its main draw in my opinion is that it plays a bit like a puzzle on each new map that you start. The starting situation is always a bit different and you have to react to them, especially which enemies and trade opportunities are nearby. Space can also be very limited which makes it an actual puzzle to fit all buildings that you want. This gives each new map, which typically lasts a few hours depending on your choice of difficulty, a new feel even though the elements are similar.

Important note: To reach this puzzle effect, I think that it is quite important in this game that you make it difficult for you. Thankfully, endless procedural maps with many configuration options allow you to do just that: you can start simple and then increase the difficulty step by step.

The last point might be important if you come from a game like Anno or Cities: Skylines. I love both of these game series and they are also a lot of fun if they are easy in my opinion. By design, PoP is different in that it lacks the realism of those two games. Moreover, when PoP is too easy for you, building complex and efficient supply chains is not really a challenge whereas it still is in a game like Anno 1800.

Finally, some points that are missing in the current early access version:
- there is no direct unit control: I personally don‘t mind it, but be aware of that
- there is no story campaign, just a set of predefined maps - this would be nice eventually, but also not a deal breaker for me
- there is no multiplayer, but coop is announced for early next year
- the UI misses some information about production chains and efficiency, but this is already on the roadmap for February 2024
- The starting situations and objectives could be even more varied, but this is also on the roadmap already
- Some quality of life feature are missing, e.g. placing farmlands easier, but this is also on the roadmap

As a closing remark, I think that early access is an amazing concept for this kind of game where you play many maps, each lasting a few hours because it will make it fun to play now and then pick it up again after each major update. This is very different from story-driven games that you really only play once. So here people who start now don’t get the worst experience of all players, but they just get more of the experience.

However this is one of the rare reviews that I will not recommend until it is out of early access. Been burnt out by way too many of the city-builders. Refunded for the time being.

This title shows a lot of promise if they can deliver. However in its current state I can’t see going over 4-5hrs of played time before getting bored.

The price for which it is sold should at least contain a bit more content, right now it feels more like a completed proof of concept and gameplay (which is very solid)

The Good
+ You have the whole (or most) Economy Concept ready and implemented. It's good and really feels like a descendant of the Settlers Genre

+ The randomized map engine provides good replayability

+ Nice Graphics. Attractive to the eye


The Bad
- There is no campaign or storyline at the moment; all you can do is play a map that is either premade or generated

- Buildings aren't distinct and unique enough, you can sometimes build the wrong building because it looks alike or the buildings get lost in your city and you sometimes forgot you build a workshop or school.

- The UI is fairly bare-bones, it would be handy to have more tooltips and explanation of the UI as well as a stats page or something similar to keep track of everything.

- Sense of progression feels a bit bland. All you do is just build Guard Towers and that's it. No interactions with the world really. It just feels like you are there and expanding but there isn't much purpose. The objectives depending on the map could just be something like ""Be friends with all AI factions on the map"" and that's about it. You don't really feel a need to go further down the food production chain or any tertiary products",1702678873,1702678873,False,4,0,0.494234532117843628,0,True,False,True

I have little time in it but, as first impression, it feels like there is not a strong reason to have the economy going other than it is beautiful to look at the animations and attentions to details the developers have put into the game.

Pioneers of Pagonia reminds me of the hours and hours I've sunk into Settlers II and Settlers IV back in the days of old. It is quite relaxing to just watch your village grow and see all the people busying around. The love and care put into the building designs and the quality of the animations is really lovely and I've spent at least an hour or two already just looking at my people doing their jobs. 

If you are looking for a city builder that lets you build and build almost as much as you want to, look no further. Once the map is finished loading, your mind starts racing, thinking about how to use the free space before you. A natural forest you can use as an inifinte wood and meat source with a forester, hunting lodge and a few woodcutters here, a patch of land with a variety of different soils available that just scream ""build farms here"" there, a wide open field well suited for your tavern and town center right over there or a large area of ores nearby that make an industrial area a good choice, you'll always find something more to build.

If you came here for a complex fighting system or opposing factions like back in the old days of Settlers, you'll be severely disappointed. It might (in the very, very distant future) become a thing but don't get your hopes up, this is no RTS or Settlers where fighting for resources or territory is a big focus. The difficulties come from the neutral enemies that range from mildly annoying on the lower difficulties to quite challenging on the higher ones. The great thing about them is that you can decide before you start if you want them at all, and if, how strong. So if you want to chill and just build, build, build... well, you can. If you want to be forced to think efficiently and have to rush towards the depth of military units to defend yourself with, you can do that too.  

For those looking for goals that aren't beat some enemy camps up, you can look into the trading route and ally yourself with neutral villages by doing jobs for them, ranging from supplying items to them or locations they want you to, to discovering random things on the map all the way to building landmarks for them. As reward, you get better items from trade, vision and later even can join forces and merge.

At the time of writing (2 days after Early Access Release), there's a few smaller issues I've noticed.
- If you are trying to trade / supply items for neutral villages and your trade carriers get scared due to a boar, they drop the item, it has to be recovered and then they try again. If unlucky, this can repeat for hours... a better pathfinding to avoid walking through forests or being able to set the path the carriers take to the villages trading posts would be a big help.
- Setting up farmland can be annoying, since you have to select for every single small patch you place what exactly is supposed to be grown on there. Of course, you could also keep other farms far enough away from the fields and select only the crop / vegetable you want on the farm itself, though that can be difficult to achieve if space is limited or you have different soils that work best for different crops / vegetables. 
- Guards not following the patrol command and focusing on expansion at any cost is somewhat annoying too, though that is easily fixed by swapping out guards for soldiers, rangers & fearnaughts. Or the devs could add a button that toggles just territory claiming on and off maybe? 
- Personally, I'm not a big fan of every thief and bandit on the map knowing where you are even if you don't know where they are and coming for your stuff from literally the other end of the map. It makes it quite tedious to have to send multiple exploring parties and rush the expansion process just to get some peace and quiet lol. 
- I'm not sure if it is intentionally set up like this or is a code limitation but Werewolves and Spectres just ignoring Bandits and Thieves doesn't make much sense to me. Thieves and Bandits being allied I can understand but the monsters don't have much reason to like them over me, do they?
- When building, having a road already set up can be detrimental to the building space. I've had to delete roads, place the building and then draw the exact same road again, in exactly the same place as before, just to fit the building in the space a lot of times. While not a big issue, it is a minor annoyance.
- When sending Advanced Military Units to take out hostile camps with like 64 copper coins and 40 silver coins in treasury, I expect them not to die in the 2nd or 3rd fight against low tier enemies. 

By now I've finished / won all the pregenerated maps and tested around a bit with the map generator and I'm impressed with what a small but experienced dev team has accomplished already for an Early Access Release. Is it a bit rough around the edges? Sure. Is there room for improvement? Most definitely. Is it a great time regardless? Absolutely. Add to that that they listen to feedback well (added Speed Change Option, changes to Farmland since the Demo, larger Storages on roadmap) and you know this game has a bright future, if given the time and love it is given at the moment. Keep up the great work Envision!

The tutorial is outrageously bare-bones, and progression is almost non-existent. You're given access to almost everything immediately, and the only real challenge is to wait for things to be built once you've placed them down.

The game runs really well, and it feels like it would scale well across a range of systems. The graphics and art style are also charming, and the presentation is clean. The UI is a little heavy, and without a tutorial to ease you in, it feels a little overwhelming. Some of the building icons look almost identical, and having to navigate through the building sub-menus can feel like a chore.

If you're looking for a good management with decent progression, then this isn't it. At least not yet. I feel like a lot of the positive reviews I've come across on Steam aren't being overly forthcoming about the state of this game. It feels like it's stuck somewhere between a creative and sandbox mode, with little to offer in terms of replayability at this time. I'll definitely be checking back on this one once it's out of EA. But for now, I'd rather take the refund and go elsewhere with my money.

[h2] TL;DR [/h2]
If you want a complete management/city-building style game, then I'd highly recommend picking up Anno 1800. It'll likely get a decent discount during the Steam Winter Sale next week, so you can pick up some of the DLC and have a blast. Pioneers of Pagonia has got a long way to go yet, and while I usually don't mind supporting developers early on in their project, I just don't see enough here to warrant parting with my money for now.",1702584650,1702586500,False,8,1,0.521750569343566895,0,True,False,True

I never get reviews that complain about early access title not be complete. 

- So what can you expect with this game?
If you want an original settler feeling you are fine here. The game as it stands now as an early access title is not finished but feels great and is really good at this developement stage.
You can see the good basis on which they want to improve the game in the future (see roadmap) plans. 
- Is the price ok?
I think the price could be a little lower for this early access stage
- You want Multiplayer and battles with ai?
Then this game is NOT for you. At the moment it will be more like a cozy game. The battle part is not big but will evolve over the developement of the game.

Totally my lack of skills and great fun. 

I had a slight issue with the guild hall not recruiting even though I had tools available and people so I made another guild hall and another tool maker and even more chaos ensured and still no miners were working....Then I had the bright idea to turn off production at the mine - which sends away workers (or the lack of) and then turn it back  - which sends out a 'Hey I want workers message' and voila - working miners!

I love Settlers 2 and this is as close as it gets.
""Settlers 2 - The Next Generation"" is still vastly superior in my opinion and you should get that game instead of this, still runs perfect on Win11. It's called ""Die Siedler 2: 10th Anniversary"" on GoG.

Also let me clearify: Youtubers profit from liking games. All the day-1 reviews are there to sell a game, not to actually review a game. You having fun playing a game is optional - selling the game to you is mandatory. That's why a refund system such as Steam offers it, is so great.

And another clarification: The new Settlers is still dogpoo compared to this game. Which does not make this game great, as everyone assumes. If the new Settlers is 2/10, this game is 5/10.

Some very subjective things first:
- The audio design is quite boring. No Settlers feeling at all unfortunately. No ""Jiippii"" or nerve-wrecking prompt sounds. The music is okay-ish. It conveys the feeling of being safe, which you are because there is literally no thread in this game.
- Same goes for the art style: Looks like a generic mobile game from 2015. There is nothing that makes me want to look at the details. It felt inconsistent as well, some buildings look as if the same person created them, others are completely out of place. The animations are also pointless as they do not show the ""process"" of what the person is doing. 
- The ""Wuselfaktor"" exists but who cares? Other games wusel more and better.

I personally did not want to have more resources and production chains. Other games do the ""source product --> intermediate product --> item"" in a way more satisfying way (such as Anno, Factorio, even Rimworld).
This doesn't even feel like there is more relevant chains and products, it's just more. For example now you don't have wood but two types of wood. Wowsers. Or you can choose between different crops on your field but they all serve the same purpose.

And it's also inconsistent: You now have to feed your people. No, you only need to feed them when you want them to reproduce. Which is needed because ... getting to that later.

It would make sense if the variety of products lead to something, but the game does not have an ""ultimate goal"" or anything like it. It's expanding for the sake of expanding. 
I am 36 and did this already a 1000 times in a 100 games.
And I don't mean a goal like ""achievement X"" or something. I mean: where do all the resources go in the end? Example Factorio: All resources are for sience packs which unlock better technologies which make you buiilt a rocket to escape the planet. Or Anno / Rimworld: All resources are there to upgrade your military to fight for dominance or survival.
Nothing like this here.
There also are no other factions / players / competitors. 
You have all the resources in every game and no competitors - You can limit resources by yourself in the map creation, and that's it.


What the game desperately needs is a competitive AI that has the same goals and objectives the player has (expanding, finding the shared and limited resources first, eliminating the opponent and mybe loot him) which would translate 1:1 to PvP mode as well ... 
If I'm not competing to reach the gold first to upgrade my soldiers to fight the enemy ... Why exactly am I doing all of this?
Getting back to the reproduction thing: If I do not lose half of my population in a fight against an enemy, why would I need my settlers to reproduce? Why would I do all the tings?

A well made campaign could also elevate this game immensely. 
Something to work for. A meaning, why I am doing all the work.

The main issue for me is the way combat and territory expanding work. 

To expand territories you just build one or two guard towers, and set a focus point (optional), and you capture a huge amount of territory like this after some time. It is not very satisfying, and you can't lose it. The mechanics of guard houses in Settlers were amazing and exciting as you were expanding slowly, and you had put more thought into where to expand, it worked well with with other nations as they could conquer your guard houses, and you theirs. In Pioneers of Pagonia, there are no foreign tribes, and evidently no PvP. There are allies that you can trade with and gain a reputation with, but it is quite simple.

There are enemies, but they just raid you and steal stuff, and if you destroy all of them their camp disappears. 

They also said there will be no campaign only generated maps. Not sure what they plan, but the generated maps get boring quite fast. Yes, there can be variety, but it just all follows the same kind of rules, so there are no shapes people would create. For example, Settlers 2 had maps that mimicked real countries. Not to mention complex storytelling is impossible without a campaign. Something that Settlers had.

Production chains are fine, so I wouldn't change them. Though, some things are a bit much like having softwood and hardwood. I didn't find a difference in their production, so not sure what's the point of making it more complex by having more wood choices. Maybe, if softwood didn't grow everywhere, and I had to be more selective about it, but both types grow the same. Or at least it feels like that.

There is still a lot to polish, better tooltips, more buildings, and life quality improvements, but this is expected from an early access game, and I believe it will come.

The game can be fun for a few playthroughs, but I cannot imagine myself sinking to this the same amount of hours I sank to Settlers game or even other base-building games. It is not that interesting once you try all the things.

So I wouldn't recommend it in its current form. Hopefully, it gets more interesting over time. If you have nostalgia to play Settlers, just play Settlers.",1702544302,1702544302,False,198,6,0.73569941520690918,0,True,False,True

I played 4 maps (going down the list of the pre-made ones) and none of them had any enemies other than bandits, so it's entirely possible that larger threats change this, but every time I have 500+ ""carriers"" (unemployed people basically) and no amount of spamming soldiers/builders/etc kept them from capping the ship with only 2 farms and a handful of residences.

This led to a feeling of there being no point to try and optimize. The bare minimum effort will have you swimming in resources and people and there's no reason that I could see to not just build 1-2 of everything and then turn your brain off. Something like Anno is also very generous with its resources and hard to fail at, but its very complicated production chains (with considerations such as optimal ratios that are almost never 1:1 or even 1:2 and dozens of goods) coupled with establishing multiple colonies in a single run make the game more of a puzzle. Meanwhile games like Against the Storm actively try to kill you and have you scrambling just to feed and clothe your people.

I'm hopeful that the harder threats like werewolves address this, and there's plenty they could add to the game to flesh out the production lines, but I think the game needs both more goods (while there are a variety of goods, the majority of them serve nearly identical purposes. There's no functional difference between any of the food types for example) and any reason to put in any more than the bare minimum of effort.

I don't know what the dev's plans for this game long term are, but I'm interested to see if/how any of the things I wasn't enamored with are addressed.

Leider nein. Ich habe viele Colony-Sim oder Städtebau-Sims gespielt wie RimWorld, Kingdoms Reborn, Anno, Cities Skylines und Foundation und nach meinen 2 Stunden mit dem EA release und 1 Stunde mit der Demo, finde ich leider keine Gründe dieses Spiel zu spielen. Es macht nur bedingt Spaß, fühlt sich Ziel- und Orientierungslos an und es gibt ein paar Dinge die einfach stören. Warum kann man keine Felder für Höfe zeichnen wie in Anno oder Foundation? Warum muss man alle Felder einzeln anklicken um das Saatgut auszuwählen? Warum gibt es keine Minen mehr sondern sind Kupfer, Kohle oder Eisen einfach Brocken auf dem Boden die man abbaut? Das sind alles kleine Dinge ich weiss, aber das macht mir das Gefühl kaputt. 

Das was mich immer wieder zu Anno, Kingdoms Reborn oder RimWorld zurückkommen lässt, ist dass ich dort ein Gefühl von Fortschritt hab. Ich fange mit wenig an und arbeite mich dann hoch, schalte neue Gebäude frei und muss Ressourcen und Arbeitskraft managen und ständig kleine Engpässe optimieren und kritische Entscheidungen treffen. 
Bei diesem Spiel fängt man mit so viel Ressourcen an, dass man erstmal alles einmal baut, bevor Materialien knapp werden. Das ist was ich mit Ziel und Orientierungslos meinte. Es hält mich nicht bei der Stange.

Playing it feels like a delightful stroll down memory lane, reminiscent of the days when my Amiga grappled with floppy disks, pixelated graphics, and crashes more frequent than a politician's unkept promises.

Back in those golden days, I was knee-deep in Settlers, crafting my pixelated kingdom with a nonchalant disregard for the floppy disk ballet. Fast forward three decades, and enter Pioneers of Pagonia, the brainchild of Volker Wertich, the maestro behind Settlers. It's like reconnecting with an old friend who's had a facelift but still cherishes the golden era.

This game is a smorgasbord: exploration, colonization, and trade—all served up with improved graphics and sound, making it a spa day for my nostalgia.

Hold onto your hat, there's a co-op mode on the horizon! Team up to tackle AI enemies! I haven't given it a whirl yet; I'm too busy embracing my lone wolf status, a true pioneer. The first wife wasn't fussed about the game, but the new missus? She's enchanted by the charming graphics. Or perhaps she just relishes my epic fails in battle. Marriage remains a puzzle, much like why the game won't let me tweak the speed for my arthritis-riddled mouse hand.

Now, here's where it gets fascinating. Pioneers of Pagonia isn't just a gaming extravaganza; it's a potential cognitive elixir. Studies show that gaming, with its strategic demands, can improve cognitive abilities in old age. Some even suggest it might play a role in staving off dementia and Alzheimer's. So, while I'm immersed in this strategic simulation, I might be giving my brain a workout akin to a mental gym session.

Pioneers of Pagonia is the game you can dive into for hours without a hint of boredom. It's a strategy and simulation extravaganza, a refreshing departure from the usual blood-soaked war dramas. A resounding 10/10 because, let's be real, it's a masterpiece. And as it matures through early access, we players get to play director, throwing wishes and complaints at the developers. More factions, PvP mode, and how about letting the camera zoom out a bit further for a grander view of the world you're crafting?

If you're after a game to whisk you away from the world's chaos or distract you from the aches of aging, Pioneers of Pagonia is the golden ticket. It'll make you feel like a pioneer, a settler, a legend—or, if you're anything like me, just a slightly whimsical old-timer reminiscing about the good ol' days. Here's to this intoxicating blend of nostalgia and modern flair, with the promise of even more fun on the horizon! And who knows, maybe it's not just a game; it could be my secret weapon against cognitive decline.

Für Die Siedler (besonders Teil 1+2) Fans ein Pflichtkauf. Bockt einfach abnormal & Volker Wertich bei seiner Vision zu unterstützen, war/ist ein no-brainer. Sowohl in der Beta als auch jetzt hatte ich keine (Performance)-Probleme oder Bugs.

Das Einzige, was mich stört, ist manchmal das Bauen (keine Wege, Felder etc. platzierbar, trotz Platz) und dass man in Lagern nur ein Produkt einlagern kann. Finde ich ein wenig sinnlos, aber gut :)

Ne MAC-Version wäre auch schön, aber ich verstehe, dass dies vorerst nicht von großer Wichtigkeit ist.

Anyway, mMn sollte jeder ""Die Siedler"" Fan dieses Spiel kaufen. Je größer der Support, desto mehr Features. Und gerade Volker Wertich hat es absolut verdient.

Gratulation an das gesamte Team für den gelungenen EA-Release. Freu mich auf die Reise von Pioneers of Pagonia.

Right away: I've already played several hours in the beta (October).

A must-buy for fans of The Settlers (especially parts 1+2). It's just insanely enjoyable, and supporting Volker Wertich in his vision was/is a no-brainer. I had no (performance) issues or bugs both in the beta and now.

The only thing that bothers me is sometimes the construction (unable to place paths, fields, etc., despite having space) and that you can only store one product in warehouses. I find it a bit senseless, but oh well :)

A MAC version would also be nice, but I understand that this is not of great importance for now.

Anyway, in my opinion, every ""Die Siedler"" fan should buy this game. The greater the support, the more features. And Volker Wertich especially deserves it.

Its a very pretty game that runs well, maybe missing some of that cuteness of the Settlers series had though.  But its not a direct sequel and I'm sure the devs want to have a some of their own magic in their game.

Sound is also very good, everything feels busy and as you expect it to.

The settlement layout and road flexibility is great, and very easy to use. Can plan out your roads or just let it auto-route them.

All of the buildings have great animations of the workers doing their job.

Economy is different, there's no delivery priority, or manufacture priorities currently.  Tools/weapons etc are on demand rather than stockpiled, and no unit promotion that I've seen, though there are tiers of units with better and harder gear requirements.

Seems to be a good variation in game types and customisation, but no story or progression currently (that's not a negative in my view, but some people might prefer it)

Some things that aren't negative as such but might be :) storage is weird, no storage buildings, but storage pallets in effect that can hold one type of good (controllable or anything).  Can simulate the worst rushhour if you plop a few of these down in quick succession and all the goods are moved from the production to the storage.   It 'works' so far, but could be seen as fiddly.

Mining doesn't feel as good, its just surface stone with coloured lumps in them.   Prefered the idea of underground mining.

No fishing either, but there's gathering (like Age of Empires) instead for early food.

No donkeys :( as there's no 'road' progression either, its setup not to need that mechanic..

That said if this was not EA I would not be recommending it.  It lacks a good amount of QOL polish and most noticeably for me the game really needs a production UI.  Right now you have to find the right building to tell it to create what you need and you may not even notice that you need to make more to finish a building or unit.   Finding the buildings is not easy once you get your settlement going unless you planned out placement really well.  You can set products to infinite but otherwise you just say how many you want.  Having a ""Make until X"" option would help significantly. A central UI to manage all this will make the whole mess easier to deal with also.

The managing of many different and interwoven production changes can be laid back and relaxing, but it can also be extremely challenging due to the different neutral enemies (dont expect a few easy opponent and directly cry out for a player KI, the fight against a horde of werewolves is challenging and satisfying enough!). One way or the other, it is a delight to watch your settlement grow, to plan new districts, or to launch an attack on the evil thieves to get access to these silver ores you've been longing to get to finally fight back against the werewolves.

Even though it just got into EA the depth is already quite good. There is no campaign, no multiplayer, but procedural generated maps which challenge you every time.  Pioneers gives you already tons of content! Every seed generates completely different layouts, maybe in your game you will lacking iron, another maybe even stone, in the next one maybe there is a camp of werewolves (if you want it to be challenging).

Also: Dont shy just away as there is no direct unit control. Surely, Pioneers strength is not the combat, it is based upon the early ideas of Settlers 1 & 2, where logistics and micromanagement (wider variety of tools for example) played a bigger role. But of course the controls, graphics and depth have improved a lot.

[b]Tutorial[/b] - You can start a tutorial map that doesn't start with a tutorial? That makes sense! What?

[b]Maps[/b] - Solve objectives where you can start with 3 peaceful maps or 3 hostile maps of up to 1000 x 1000 tiles.

[b]Buildings[/b] - You can't relocate buildings and can only demolish them. And even though there is a snap functionality, buildings like farm tiles don't always align properly and farm tiles need to be placed individually one by one which can be quite annoying. But at least there is a construction priority option which is unclear how to use because tutorial was almost non-existent.

[b]Controls[/b] - You can speed up the game from by toggling between x1 and x5 speed. But you can't pause the game. And there doesn't seem to be any way to order your settlers to avoid enemy combat. Once they start expanding your territory into the enemy territory, they just keep on going in there and dying until they finish their work or die for no good reason. And on top of that there doesn't even seem to be a way to locate or control your individual settlers either.

[b]Difficulty[/b] - What difficulty? Well other than no tutorial and lack of controls challenge? :D

[b]Gameplay[/b] - Smooth with decent graphics and good effects.
[b]Enviroment[/b] - Very well crafted with great ambient effects.

One of the standout features of Pioneers of Pagonia is its ""Wuselfaktor,"" or the sense of bustling activity and productivity in the game world. The game effectively captures the feeling of managing a thriving settlement, which is a testament to the developers' attention to detail. The carefully designed economic systems also contribute to this immersive experience, making resource management and city-building a rewarding endeavor.

The game's guidance through tasks and objectives is working but could be better.

However, there are areas where Pioneers of Pagonia could use some improvement. The pathfinding system could be more refined, as it sometimes leads to inefficient movement of characters and resources. Additionally, an upgrade to the road network for higher throughput could enhance the overall efficiency of the settlement. Improved transportation infrastructure can make a significant difference in the management of a growing community.

One noticeable drawback is the user interface (UI), which appears somewhat dated, resembling interfaces from the past. While it serves its purpose adequately, a more modern and user-friendly UI design could enhance the overall gaming experience and make it more visually appealing. Which also applies to the Tutorial system.

In conclusion, Pioneers of Pagonia shows promise as an Early Access title. The game's ""Wuselfaktor,"" well-thought-out economic systems, and clear task guidance provide a solid foundation for an engagingbuilding experience. While there are areas that need improvement, it's important to remember that the game is still in development.

I would be ashamed to sell a game in this state. The game has no tutorial, no campaign, no real custom adventure and the worst part is that there is only  a SINGLE map. Every map starts with you having the ship and landing on the beach with some mountains near it.
I am not joking, there is literally the same start on the same beach on every ""premade"" map and skirmish.
The game curently has 6 maps, 3 with combat and 3 without combat. The only difference between the maps is what the inner land looks like but those differences are minimal so you will literally have the same build order and layout every game.
The game also has atrocious UI, you never get any feedback of what your colony needs or produces. Feels like playing a building sim with no economy. There is nothing here, i doubt they will make a campaign or have different starting areas like starting in a dense forest or a swamp. There is no need to change building order and there is no adaptive play here. The roadmap only mentions minor improvements and Co-op:) so this is mostly replaying the same economic sim with the same build order every time.
I was really expecting a big campaign with vastly different starting areas, conditions and materials. Combat looks dissapointing but since there is no variability in starting i feel like the armies will always be the same.
Another problem is that you start with 500 people and every building uses a lot of people, it's super hard to understand what's going and to prioritise building and production lines.
In my opinion, the devs are pulling off an elaborate scam here since i don't see anything original or anything inovative, just creating some assets and using them the same way every time.",1702474718,1702474893,False,23,8,0.240506500005722046,13,True,False,True

This is without question one of the best economy/wares production focused base builders out there. The game takes the super addictive formula established by games like the Settlers series, and expands upon it in modern ways.

Building your settlement is super rewarding, not least because of the high level of detail - you can follow every piece of raw material and every trade good to its final destination, you see the workers in the buildings doing their thing, and the hustle and bustle of your ant colony is extremely satisfying to watch.

The production chains all feel well balanced and can get quite complex in the later game. The procedural map generation works quite well and is very adjustable so you can tune the challenge to your tastes. Want less building space, harder enemy camps? No problem. Prefer a more peaceful approach with weaker enemies, if any, and plenty of fertile flat land? Also no issue.

The maps are varied enough from game to game to pose new challenges every time. Perhaps you don't have immediate access to deer, which will hamper your production of goods that require leather and might mean that you'll have to build a bigger flax production than you usually would. Or perhaps the nearest iron and silver veins are quite far from your starting point, meaning you might have to prioritize between expansion to a certain area to gain access to iron and silver, or taking on that pesky thief camp close by.

There are also neutral factions on the map, which you can trade with and do favours for. Doing enough favours will eventually unlock more, generally more profitable trading options. If you keep raising their approval you can even join their territory with yours, although that will end all trading with that faction, as it ceases to exist.

Military isn't a huge factor in this game, and while the enemy camps on the map can pose a significant challenge if you don't handle them swiftly, there is (at least at this time, who knows what might come!) no warfare against the other factions / skirmish-type play.

My only real qualm right now is the farming system - placing individual fields can be fiddly, doesn't look great, and restricting the crop type on them is a pretty tedious task if you want to change many fields at once. That is a very minor critique though and that being my biggest point of issue right now just shows how good the core game is.

There's many features I would still wish for to be added, but I am confident that we'll see many of them make it into the game during its Early Access period.

I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone even remotely interested in the genre. The early access price is fantastic and I'd say it's worth every penny.",1702468853,1702468853,True,67,2,0.786503374576568604,0,True,False,True

The progress from the betas into open early access has been big. There were a lot of features added (big maps, missions, unit tiers, etc). The biggest improvement is the economy and infrastructure aspects.

You will feel Settlers 2/3 vibes, you will love the traffic jams on the roads, BUT THIS TIME BOTH WAYS. Yes my friend in management, roads go both ways now!

While there's still a lot of features to come (this is Early Access), but it's already so much fun! The economy mechanics feel like a finished game. The most balancing in near future will be likely in regard to enemies and mission objectives.

You can select map with no enemies for complete chill, or generate map that will be so hard the enemies will crush you. Or, of course something inbetween :)",1702464548,1702464548,True,104,4,0.858000099658966064,5,True,False,True
