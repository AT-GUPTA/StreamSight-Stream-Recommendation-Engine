With just over 1000 hours, most of those streamed via OBS studio, I can confidently say that this is hands down the best app I have used. The English translation from Japanese is great with no grammatical errors, so navigating the UI is easy. I have only encountered bugs regarding hotkeys, but those are fixed via restarting the program or resetting all emotes/expressions and are overall very minor and don't occur often.

Recently, I started using plugins with VTube studio to boost its performance, such as VTChaos, and Mix it up. With the API update, VTube Studio runs amazing and seamlessly with these plugins, allowing easy repositioning at the press of a button on a stream deck, changing ""expressions"" or adding items to the scene based on keywords said by viewers in your Twitch/YouTube chat.

One thing I wish was different was the ability to toggle a ""condensed view"" of your hotkeys. currently I have over 30 set up and its a little annoying to have to scroll through them individually to change or remove one.

You can add your own models, items, backgrounds by browsing VTube's local files and modifying the ""streamingassets"" folder <3",1645025285,1645025864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
