Overall: I've had some fun with this game (763 hours at the time of this writing). I'll keep coming back to it. That said, if you get it, understand its challenges and issues - of which there are many. Having also bought the other games in the series (UA both types), you'll find many of the same issues. If you can work around them, great, but know what you're getting. Finally, there is a substantial body of knowledge on the web about this game in particular. Want to know how to beat a particular mission? There's a how to out there.

Pros: 
1) moving your units around the battlefield is a lot of fun and the units typically are more responsive than what you might see in the TW series.
2) The army management system is interesting and fun, if perhaps unrealistic. In reality, the difference between an 1855 and a 1863 musket was pretty negligible, but hey, whatever. It gives you something to spend the money on.
3) Good tactics are generally rewarded - which I appreciate.

Cons:
1) the LOS system in this game is one of the worst I've seen in decades of playing wargames. I can't tell you how many times I've suffered under artillery fire from batteries that I just somehow can't see. Considering most of these are LOS weapons, that's simply ridiculous. While I get it that terrain plays a role in seeing things, with direct fire systems, if the enemy is shooting at you, you should have a very good chance at seeing them - particularly a big honking cannon belching smoke. 

2) Speaking of LOS, the terrain that would obscure or enable LOS is not intuitive. There are the occasional eyespot points, but mostly not at all. A LOS analysis tool would be useful, but this is a finished game, so that's not going to happen. Mostly, just detach skirmishers (who seem to have better eyes for some reason) and stumble forward until you see something.

3) The opening unit placement in this game is simply horrible and completely arbitrary. Sometimes you have multiple set up boxes and the ability to very carefully place your units, other times, your units are just scattered around the battlefield, many times not even with unit integrity. There is also no rhyme or reason to this. I can detail out the starting locations of union forces at the opening of Stones River, which is ostensibly a Confederate surprise attack, but not the union forces at the beginning of the Mule Shoe, which is a deliberate (planned) assault on a fixed position. Oftentimes, this reaches the level of the absurd, such as at Fredericksburg for the Confederates, where you get a set up box with one brigade, and box is barely larger than that brigade, but the computer gets to determine the locations for all of your units in the following deliberate defenses.

4) The battles are very stilted and do not allow for variations when the player changes history. Hold the line at Seminary Ridge at Gettysburg, completely smashing both Hill's and Ewell's corps? That's ok, you're thrown back on Cemetery Ridge the next day without even the option to stay. Also, see above about unit placement. This happens repeatedly in essentially every major battle, on both sides.

5) On the topic of battles, the timers and flags makes things absolutely silly. 

First, the timers. Sometimes you get extra time, sometimes you don't. Some might argue this shows real uncertainty. Not really. Trust, me I've done this for real, this is not how it works. What this means is that people have to search wikis to see if they need to make the timeline or not, and then adjust accordingly - uncertainty gone. Also, having been in real fights, the absurdity of battles abruptly ending mid volley with brigades in each other's faces is simply ridiculous. 

Now the flags - While I get the point of objectives and key terrain, the way they are implemented is silly. For instance, at Shiloh, the Union can slaughter the Confederate army by the bushel, holding its ground, but let a small cav brigade get around your flank and sit on Pittsburgh landing, you've lost the battle - even if the rest of the Confederate Army is dead.

If you share this interest, you, like I, are probably aware of how few games tackle this period and that none of them have ever been great. I would rank UGCW as the best I have played, but it is still a relatively limited game with some unfortunate mechanical flaws. There is no grand strategy, you raise/tweak your army before each battle and then have it out. Your performance in battle makes minimal difference on subsequent battles. Winning the Peninsula Campaign doesnt end the war in 1862 or even change where the next battle happens. You dont need to big brain any battles to be successful, but a basic understanding of the mechanics doesnt hurt. In general you just want to outflank the enemy and rout their units so you attain concentrated fire. Topography does play a role but concentration of fire and getting your artillery in close will nearly always win out. What the game excels at is allowing you to control your units very easily, letting you use units commanded by your favorite generals to lick some rebel/northern scum, and letting you play out all the big battles. Union and Confederate campaigns are 90% the same battles. The game also has some bsic rpg elements for army composition, letting you lel up and select upgrades for your units and comanders.

But a friend of mine suggested the game to me after I told him that I like games where casualties sustained are carried over like in Homeworld series, Ogre Battle and Fire Emblem. I was still skeptical, but here is my review:

Game-play loop: 9/10
In the campaign, your manage your army and go from battle to battle, managing each brigade up to multiple Corps. You have to manage your officers, Soldiers and their experiences, which are tied to each individual. The battles take between 20-80 minutes. The tactics rely more on positioning rather than the arcade style of Total War. If two units are in perfect cover, they can spend the entire battle firing at each other and barely lose 20% of their Soldiers.

Sound/Music: 5/10
Functional, music is alright, I don't really listen to it. Gun sounds are representative.

Story/Narrative: 8/10
Follows history, but allows tactical freedom and the ability to change history, such as CSA victory at Gettysburg. Or Union victory at Gaines Mill. As a general you are immersed in that you feel your loses, the restriction of funds and the lack of equipment that you may face during the Civil War.

Graphics: 4/10
Functional, nothing special to talk about. Sometimes the units have the wrong animation. Terrain height can also be a bit confusing at times.

Final Remarks: This game is definitely carried by the battles. Its a great feeling when you enter battle with 9,000 Soldiers against the enemy's 17,000 and you end up losing 500 Soldiers while the enemy loses 12,000. All because you use your skirmishers, cavalry and artillery properly. Or when your mission is to assault a location like Malvern Hills, Deploying about 25k against 34k and end up losing nearly half of your army, yet still taking the hill, which is historically inaccurate. It goes to show that positional advantage plays a huge role.",1704437389,1704437389,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You certainly sacrifice some of the visual complexity and sophistication of later TW titles, but this more than makes up for it in how stable and responsive the command system feels. I don't find myself nearly as frustrated with how my units are maneuvering after receiving orders (barring dragoons/mounted rifleman, I wish you could toggle their skirmishing off) as I do with something like Warhammer 3.

Would love to see a version of this game set in the Napoleonic era.

My only major gripe is that the battle timer can sometimes feel arbitrary and I have definitely had a battle end up as a draw because my opponent was able to force me off the point in the last two seconds and contest it.

The sound effects are not where they should be in relation to the men yelling, since the South had its infamous ""rebel yell"", although it is missing in this game. The two sides sound identical. Shame. I would only pick this up if you are a hardcore civil war buff, but even then you will quickly begin to see what I am describing here. Casual players will likely be disappointed in the poor AI decision making. The game is missing the option for some kind of music during the battles as well, which they put in age of sail, and it was quite good in that game. It is like they didn't even try to make the scenarios playable, and focused too much on trying to be historically accurate. Bottom line: The maps get too ""busy"" with units to manage if you're not into that kind of fast paced complexity. I enjoyed Sid Meir's Gettysburg so many years ago. That was a far better game IMO, even with less impressive graphics. As well as ultimate general Gettysburg for IOS. There is no random scenario generator to encourage replay in this game, which was a huge disappointment. I stopped playing the campaign after experiencing game breaking balancing and playability issues at Gaines Mill. Enough was finally enough. Age of sail is much better in my opinion. If you are a casual player and do not enjoy a very large amount of units to manage, this might not be a good fit.

*Updated

I gave this game another go, and built the largest infanty corps I could early on, which helped with some of the scenarios. This game has a significant learning curve, both to the army management, and the actual battles. If you do not get the management part of the game right early on, it will make many of the scenarios too difficult to accomplish. Once you get a feel for how you need to set up your army to suit your play style, you can have some fun with this RTS. It still feels lacking in the sound effect area, particularly with the same sounds that are used in other games.",1700766365,1702613897,True,0,0,0.514006137847900391,0,True,False,False

• Semi-autonomous units. Unit officers will adjust and engage threats on the march and in the field on their own and are not completely brain-dead like Total War units who will just walk into danger without question (don't get me wrong though they still sometimes need help). You can also delegate instructions to division-level officers and they will do their best to complete your orders. The drag-a-path movement feature allows you to create more complex maneuver orders when you want.

• The battles can be really dynamic sometimes. Instead of simply eliminating the enemy or holding a bunch of static objectives the battles often change or develop in real-time. Suddenly, you might find yourself performing a fighting retreat or a glorious assault on newly decided objectives. Reinforcements or ambushes can really shake up the battle. The AI in this game is also fairly aggressive and competent and will attempt to envelop you when possible so you need to always be paying attention to your flanks and for spooky business.

• The campaign-specific features like your career points and unit progression are really cool. I can level up my stats that benefits my army in different ways. You can also equip your units with different weapons between battles. It's pretty cool that I can give my battle-hardened 1st and 2nd Infantry brigades lever-action goodies and watch them go crazy. You can also spend reputation points from winning battles on getting other bonuses but if you spend too much your public support becomes weak.

• Supply wagon system for logistics (ammunition). You need to make sure you not only bring enough supplies for the battle but also know how to position your supplies and when to bring them to your depleted units. In longer battles the need to properly manage your logistics becomes really important.

• The line-of-sight and terrain system is pretty good. Heavier terrain slows you down, provides more cover, and makes you more sneaky. Open terrain lets you move faster and fire more effectively but you are very vulnerable.",1701596319,1702378158,True,22,0,0.701055288314819336,0,True,False,False

I like that it challenges the hegemony of the Total War series.   
I like that it's a different arena - the Civil War.   
I like how much content it has, tons of engagements, from skirmishes to battles.   
I like that you can build your divisions and corps and see them expand over time.   
I like that you can outfit units with different weapons, including cavalry and artillery units.  

But there also some things that fall flat:  
It doesn't tell you about many important features, and you suffer unless you explore and find them.
It doesn't tell you, clearly, what many things do. Does ""condition"" affect accuracy, or morale? I don't know.  
It doesn't give examples of what different weapons or artillery do, or how they will benefit you.
In many cases you have to tinker with things, but your decisions are very expensive, and permanent.

Skirmishers are probably the most powerful unit. Because the dominant tactic is always surround a unit and break their morale. But I didn't realize I could separate skirmishers from units until a few battles in.

So, many battles, you're just lining up and taking it in the teeth - often struggling because your, initially, green units are getting mauled by veteran Confederate units.

Once you start detaching skirmishers and circling around, it's easy to consistently break enemy units, capture and kill artillery, and capture supply wagons.

Because of this, many of the battles start to feel 'samey'.  
Each is challenging enough, and different enough, to draw you in.
However, you will (a) detach skirmishers, (b) race to surround and break your enemy, (c) win, go to camp, replenish your units, (d) do it again. 

I stopped even buying artillery or cavalry units and just massed infantry. I tried various artillery such as howitzers and long guns, and it wasn't clear if they were more useful or not. I bombarded enemy units, not in cover, with 2 howitzer groups, and they took little damage. But then Confederate artillery of unknown guns just nailed my own artillery across the map with pinpoint accuracy.

Massed cavalry is amazing, but expensive, and dies quickly. So again, it tends to be a bad investment.

One of the best wargames out there
Somehow, the developers managed to make a game, that is almost perfect.
You have you army, that starts from a small force, to vast multi core army, with brigades, regiments, artillery, cavalry, infantry.
Its amazing, how this game manages to give player so many options to customize and develop his forces, while still remain interesting, engaging and fairly ""Balanced"" all the way throughout entire campaign.
The battles are pretty realistic in terms of line warfare and fire superiority, your forces ""Push"" the enemy and gain ground by using an overwhelming firepower, flanking and a bayonet charge. 
Unlike many other wargames, you don't actually have to kill every enemy soldier for a change...

It seems like the game has a lot of respect for all these soldiers and Officers, who fought and died in an American Civil war, and tries to depict history through a series of battles.
As a player, you also have a chance to learn the logistical part of that war.
As the war progresses, you get a chance to learn more about the firearms and artillery pieces. 
All these Springfields, Ordnance cannons, Napoleon cannons, Cavalry carbines...
If you play as a north, you will get a lot of high-end weapons and the amount of recruits will be almost endless
But the South have more skilled and resilient soldiers on their side.
What will prevail?
Industry might of the north or a desperate bayonet charge of the south?",1683006247,1701125057,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

outside the review, you guys developing these games are awesome! keep up the good work! i haven't had that much fun since AOE 2 released!!

as in all great games, give us as players the freedom, and we will always keep playing! keep it just to campaign and we will tire after a while and move on. ( maybe still play every year or so until someone else dose it better)

I adored Sid Meier's Gettysburg for PC, though, which is one of the first things I ever bought with my own money when I was 14.  I found it incredibly thrilling.  I was going to enjoy this game no matter what for that reason as long as it more or less resembled SMG in the way it played, and it does.  I have lots of small gripes not worth getting into, but by far the biggest problem with this game is that for a ""dynamic"" campaign it is more or less on rails.  I have only spent significant time on the North campaign and it's incredibly frustrating because I find it very easy all the way until Fredericksburg and after that the game just sabotages you in order to force Gettysburg into being a more or less even fight, and by the time Gettysburg is over you have a tiny army and every battle after that is needlessly difficult.  Overall there isn't really anything dynamic about the way the campaign goes along.  The south was up against it from the outset and many scholars believe that it was Mclellan's unwillingness to take risks and take advantage of the materiel advantage early on that allowed the war to drag on until finally Grant forced the issue and made it a war of attrition.  Obviously it's much more difficult to make a campaign truly dynamic and ahistorical, but I think it could have been done much, much better.  My second biggest issue is the lack of immersive flourishes.  For instance, Sid Meier's Gettysburg had cinematic introductions to each phase of the battle with generals discussing strategy in period language and accents.  I loved that to death and I still remember bits and pieces of it from 30 years ago.  ""We lack only for shoes, suh.""  I realize that this is a small studio and it's better to do it not at all than poorly, but I would love that kind of thing to be added, even if it's just lo-fi graphics and text like an SNES RPG.  Another great memory I have from SMG is that when you won a battle, they played a yell of your troops and a band would play Dixie if you were the south or the battle hymn of the republic if you were the North.  I still remember what a rush it was and how emotional it was hearing those tunes.  Something like that would be great.  I hope they're working on a dramatically improved sequel.  That said, I greatly enjoy playing this and I wish there were many more like this one.  I would love a modern version of Napoleon's campaigns as well with just the battles, none of the other crap they have in games like total war.",1699002082,1699002082,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The development is here but the reason I say the game play suffers for the ease of an oversimplified ""balance"" issue to alleviate their ""trouble"" with proper balancing is level or advancement ""SCALING"". Just like Oblivion or so many games before, where you can be doing great and the game not only doesn't account for that but pretends you never did anything amazing and throws the kitchen sink at you but if you had no agency or skill the game would ""pretend"" for ""balancing"" that you were amazing and make the enemy weaker.

One of the biggest flaws is the agonizingly slow pacing of the game. Some might enjoy that, but many of us want to enjoy playtime rather than wait for units to slowly crawl across the field. Another is poor AI, and very inconsistent ability to command the AI - there is a menu that allows you to give AI controls, but you will rarely encounter it because it's only available for certain selections. And, there are no commands that are actually useful - such as for skirmishers to stay in skirmish range and to retreat when approached by infantry. There is also no ability or tendency for units to take cover or to stay in cover. This means you will do a lot of micromanagement, which is neither historically accurate (as a general had little ability to get new information or to send new commands during a battle), nor is it fun. 

Also, some of the defaults in the game are completely mindless, and should have been fixed long ago in alpha and playtesting. One of the biggest is the tiny default size of supply wagons - 2,000, when they can be increased to 20,000. This should have been 10,000 by default; and if you forget to set it when creating a new army, that army is doomed in its first battle. 

Perhaps the biggest flaw is the inability to merge units in the management screen. This means that veteran and elite units will inevitably shrink in size, or will need to be constantly replenished with rookie troops that will lower their skills, or with extremely expensive troops that drain your funds. And, as you get good at the game, the opponent's army size will increase - so you'll have units of 600 infantry up against enemy units of 2,000+.


It is little things like this, which should be easily possible for the developers to improve, which make the game deeply frustrating rather than enjoyable. Do not expect the developers to improve this - they have not done so in the 6 years since the game was released.",1698608551,1698608551,False,11,1,0.598728418350219727,0,True,False,False

This game feels how 19th century battle maps look.

[h3] Perfection In Simplicity [/h3]
There are only four unit types; infantry, skirmishers, artillery, cavalry. Many unit behaviors we are used to micromanaging are automatic; infantry fire and reload on the move when an enemy is in range while they are carrying out a move order, skirmishers hold fire while undetected, skirmishers and cavalry fall back to reload after firing, [b] artillery switch between shot types [/b] and (un)limber, all units turn to face the nearest enemy.

[h3] Tactics and Maneuver [/h3]
Units do not rock-paper-scissors each other. Prevailing in an engagement comes from terrain, flanking, concentrated fire and equipment usage. You do not send unit A to hard counter unit B. [b] 200-500 skirmishers can engage, survive, flank, and delay a 2500 strong infantry battalion. [/b] Rookies in favorable terrain with close artillery support, and flanking skirmishers or infantry can handily beat back hardened veterans. Maps and armies are large enough, upwards of 120,000 soldiers, to allow large maneuvers. Identify the weak flank and send half or more of your army to roll up their sides and rear - if you have time before nightfall. Just like Chancellorsville but this time it's your idea :) Forests, rivers, fields, towns; attack the weakest areas - or send your men to the meat grinder of breastworks, I'm not your dad.

[h3] Your Army - Your Way [/h3]
Control over all levels; battalion, division, corps, army. The units you bring into battles are all your own. How many of each type, how many men in each battalion, how many guns in each battery. Artillery battery with 24-pounder howitzers (shotgun kings) or 20-pounder Parrots (counter battery scythes)? 250 skirmishers armed with long range Whitworths or short range repeating rifles? 1500 veterans or 2500 rookies?

The Good:
The Army Organization choices and Unit/Officer progression are my favorite parts of the game. These aspects allow you to shape the army to realize your vision. Do I want large infantry brigades of mostly green soldiers or should I focus on smaller brigades of battle hardened veterans? You can determine the characteristics of a unit as it ranks up. One infantry brigade can be strong in stamina and melee while another is more efficient and better with their weapons.
On the tactical side the AI is NOT 100% scripted.  When AI units initially deploy to the map  they are static. The opposing force adapts to your choices over the course of the fight, hence ""no plan survives contact with the enemy"". Battlefield tactics and use of terrain are in full play and work well.

The Bad:
I'm a big fan of sandbox play so...
My least favorite part of the game is when it feels scripted. On the strategic side you have to fight battles in a specific order with a set start/finish date of the war, hence the ""historical"" feel to the game. A game, if possible, should not only offer the historical battles and an historical campaign, but also sandbox play. Basically you make the strategic choices, i.e. where battles would be fought, whether to be offensive/defensive, do I fight a war of attrition.
Units cannot mix weapons. Not a game breaker, just FYI. An infantry brigade of 1500 soldiers has the same weapon so if your short on a rare weapon your brigade size can only grow as large as the availability of that weapon. Units in the CW sometimes had a mix of weapons i.e. 33% Harpers Ferry M1855, 33% Springfield M1855, 33% Springfield 1861.

And The Ugly:
Scaling.

As someone who is a huge fan of the American Civil War and grew up playing Civil War Generals 2 and Sid Meier's Gettysburg, this title fulfilled my need for a contemporary Civil War game. There just aren't a lot of titles to choose from and the ones that I have played were lackluster or just mods for existing games such as Empire Total War.  This game combines the best of Civil War Generals 2 and Sid Meier's Gettysburg as well as having that Total War franchise feel to it - but without the bugs (mostly). I can tell that the producer was a fan of both of the aforementioned titles, especially Civil War Generals 2. 

The game starts in 1861 near the beginning of the War and allows you to command a small force to either capture a fort (South) or a small city (North). Depending on difficulty, this is either a trivial first mission (colonel difficulty) or nigh-impossible (Legendary difficulty). You have time frame to capture and hold the objective points. After the first battle you are brought to an army camp screen where you train new brigades and equip them with weapons based on how many you captured from the enemy in the last battle(s) and how many you can afford since you are awarded supplies/cash after every victory. Once you equip your small army, you move onto another small battle and then to the first Battle of Bull Run. In this “Major” battle your recently raised troops form a portion of the army and the rest of the troops are historical units that actually fought in the battle. On legendary difficulty, this battle is far easier than the previous smaller battles. For some reason, there is an extremely long time limit on this battle. Since I had almost infinite time, on both my playthroughs I hunted down and wiped out the entirety of both armies to get as many captured weapons as possible. I more or less followed this strategy until the late-game battles where it was either too costly or not enough time is available. I think there are rough 15-20 major battles that get progressively more challenging, especially as the south. Finally, the last major battle is fought at either Richmond or Washington where you face a horde of enemy troops desperate to defend their capitol.

The Union Legendary campaign, while challenging, was far easier that the southern campaign. As the South, after Antietam you really start to have difficulty in replenishing your troops as you face better equipped and increasingly large union armies. You really have to start playing cautiously and smart as the South as taking too many casualties will be a catastrophic mistake which will snowball and lose you the game. The first playthrough I made it all the way to Cold Harbor but I had to restart because I simply didn’t have enough troops to hold back the union onslaught. The second time around I played conservatively through every single battle and even kept a detailed excel grid of how many losses I suffered and how many casualties I inflicted. I managed to grind my way through the last few battles and made it to Washington with an army of over 100,000 troops which I was ecstatic about. However, even though I managed to capture the city I didn’t realize that I then needed to HOLD the city including all the forts in which I just captured. I ended up quitting and I almost quit and uninstalled the game because my troops had taken horrendous casualties taking these forts and I now had to face an army of OVER 200,000 union troops! I was outnumbered 4 to 1!! Finally (yesterday) I managed to calm down and ended up saving the game six separate times during the battle to minimize casualties to I could then be prepared to fight the endless waves of Union troops. After several restarts and over ten hours of grinding and min-maxing, I barely held on the city and finally won the south campaign. What a ride! I will say that I got so frustrated so many times that I had to quit for weeks or months at a time. I almost gave up on winning as the South on Legendary because it was just too hard to replenish causalities, especially in my veteran brigades. In hindsight I would say that this is a very necessary problem for the south based on history and adds a great deal of immersion. 

The Union Campaign is difficult early on as you struggle to take positions that are heavily entrenched. Oddly enough though, I think the hardest battle on the Union side was Malvern Hill where you face a horde of Confederate soldiers who rush and quickly overwhelm you. Only timely reinforcements kept me from losing this battle as I clung on for dear life. The latter battles become easier as you slowly but surely amass greater number and superior firepower. The union artillery is especially effective and as you gunners gain experience they can tip battles in your favor with a few rounds of deadly canister shot. By the time the last battle at Richmond came I had a massive army of almost 200,000 troops and I simply grinded down my foe whom I outnumbered by almost 50,000. General Grant would be proud!

With all of that said, this is a great game. I think this is probably on of only five games that I’ve put over 1000 hours on in my life. I found brigadier General difficulty to be too trivial and Legendary difficulty to be too challenging at first, so I decided to “get good” and figure out how to win on Legendary. I would say in terms of challenge this game is S Tier. I had to restart battles and even campaigns several times because I either took to many casualties, got overwhelmed, or lost valuable units that got stranded and either shattered or surrendered. 

The game is not free of bugs, there is this super-annoying one where enemy cavalry will become un-targetable and just run through your lines and end up reforming in your rear and start wreaking havoc. There is another one where feeling troops will get stuck in rivers and sit there taking shots until they shatter. The AI itself is fairly competent and will attack weak points but is prone to over-committing and doing these “highland charges” where entire divisions will just run at you en-masse and take massive casualties if you know how to counter it. Another “bug” is where if you scale your troops down to smaller brigade sizes the enemy armies won’t be as large. Personally, I tried to exploit this at first but then thought it was too much cheese. It also lowered the enjoyment factor as I like to fight massive armies and capture lots of weapons. The AI units also tend to stand out in the open and take fire instead of seeking cover.

Overall, this is a solid game that has kept me entertained for the last five years. I would recommend it to anyone who is either a fan of the civil war or a fan of the horse and musket time period. It’s FAR superior to Empire Total war as the units don’t bug out on terrain and fire when you tell them too (for the most part). The Legendary difficulty is no joke and was one of the most challenging RTS experiences I’ve ever had. It was extremely fun and rewarding although it was also very frustrating at times. I’d give this game a 4.5/5 and would highly recommend it. Be warned though, it’s addictive and might keep you up late at night!",1692562099,1692562099,True,93,0,0.904252052307128906,6,True,False,False

The Civil War was fought in 10,000 places, from Valverde, New Mexico, and Tullahoma, Tennessee, to St. Albans, Vermont, and Fernandina on the Florida coast. More than 3 million Americans fought in it, and over 600,000 men, 2 percent of the population, died in it.
American homes became headquarters, American churches and schoolhouses sheltered the dying, and huge foraging armies swept across American farms and burned American towns. Americans slaughtered one another wholesale, right here in America in their own cornfields and peach orchards, along familiar roads and by waters with old American names.
In two days at Shiloh, on the banks of the Tennessee River, more American men fell than in all the previous American wars combined. At Cold Harbor, some 7,000 Americans fell in twenty minutes. Men who had never strayed twenty miles from their own front doors now found themselves soldiers in great armies, fighting epic battles hundreds of miles from home. They knew they were making history, and it was the greatest adventure of their lives.
The Civil War has been given many names: the War Between the States, the War Against Northern Aggression, the Second American Revolution, the Lost Cause, the War of the Rebellion, the Brothers' War, the Late Unpleasantness. Walt Whitman called it the War of Attempted Secession. Confederate General Joseph Johnston called it the War Against the States. By whatever name, it was unquestionably the most important event in the life of the nation. It saw the end of slavery and the downfall of the southern planter aristocracy. It was the watershed of a new political and economic order, and the beginning of big industry, big business, big government. It was the first modern war and, for Americans, the costliest, yielding the most American fatalities and the greatest domestic suffering, spiritually and physically. It was the most horrible, necessary, intimate, acrimonious, mean-spirited, and heroic conflict the nation has ever known.",1691772123,1691772123,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

That said, inside of a campaign or custom battle, you can choose your commanding officer(s), choose the weapon for your particular unit (infantry, cavalry, artillery or skirmishers) and you can ""level up"" each commander after a certain amount of experience, choosing different perks for each commander.

Being able to re-name the commanding officers helps on a large-scale battle so you can remember which perks you have chosen and utilize to your best strategy/tactics.

This is a major step from the previous version of this game.

Drawbacks:

- It needs more maps.  like, a LOT more maps.
- For ""custom"" battles, I wish I could save my set of units for future use instead of having to slowly (re)create each one
- Having an ""auto-balance on/auto-balance off"" feature would be nice so you can match armies versus 3:1 or 4:1 odds
- Flanking/rear - as another user posted, if YOU are flanked/rear attacked, this matters ONLY for YOUR units.  If you do this to the computer, this doesn't seem to do much.  I found I can gang-up on one enemy unit straight-on and get better results than attempting to sneak a few units around the rear; getting the enemy in a cross-fire doesn't do a thing.
- I've noticed that friendly fire doesn't seem to be much of a thing in this game; I had six artillery units pounding a few enemy units . I charged in, my units barely took a scratch while the enemy was being slammed with artillery shells.  I would think that, in the real world, such would not be possible, let alone a simulation.  

Overall, however, I've put in a lot of hours in this game in the past two weeks alone.  As stated, I like having simple units sometimes: guns and big guns.  No snipers, no tanks, no space lasers, etc.  This is simple ground warfare with human units versus armor/remote missile strikes/special attacks.  This requires you to use strategy to plan your attack and tactics to adjust on the battlefield.  The campaign allows for growth and development.  Learning curve is low, will keep you busy for a long time.

So I picked this up again last week and have had a hard time to stop playing, I'd play the night through if I could.

To play this game well you have to learn to use combined arms (mostly infantry, skirmishers and artillery) tactics. You need to know the strength of your units and their weaknesses. The same applies to weapons, some older muskets are quite unreliable for firing, but useful in melee, but you might want to give your veterans rifled muskets instead for longer range fire. The same for artillery, use your old brass 6 pounders at point blank range, but keep your 3 inch ordnance rifles further back, maybe try and knock out enemy artillery. In addition to knowing your own units and equipment you also have to be aware of terrain and the aims of the battle you are fighting, not to mention enemy forces. It won't do to just launch a series of frontal attacks against a well defended enemy. Use cover, draw enemy fire on your skirmishers while you pound the enemy line with artillery. Once they are softened up move the regular infantry in to see what you can do. Well, that is assuming a relatively simple enemy defence. If they are really fortified it might be better to try and flank them. And of course you will not always be attacking, there will be meeting engagements where you have to rush your forces to get to better ground, but rush too much and they may gee exhausted and be unable to hold against a determined enemy. Other times you will be defending. Really lots of variations but a good tactician should be able to master most though sometimes it might be better to fight a draw rather than take too many casualties.

There are also some downsides to this game. While the game basics fit the period well there are a number of un-historic elements. For instance the size of brigades, the organisation of divisions and corps. In the end, even if you are playing as the Union you will probably be organising your forces along lines used by the Confederates, just because they are most efficient in game. Command structure could also be better reflected in the game as division leaders are highly abstracted and corps commanders' don't seem to have any real skills like brigade leaders. I've mostly played the two campaigns so far and one thing that I find to be badly designed are names for non historic battles (the small engagements with specific missions in between the large historic ones. Yes, raiding a convoy is a mission, but don't call the battle Convoy Raid, that just takes part of the immersion. Also the intelligence reports are badly written, not at all like actual correspondence of the time. 

This is a rather simple game that most anyone can play, but to play it well you have to learn tactics as commanders at the time did. This is also, at least usually, a fast game, some of the campaign battles only taking half an hour, while larger ones might take two or even more.

Before I started playing Ultimate General: Civil War I had played quite a bit of Ultimate Admiral: Age of Sail, that is the more recent game in the series. I wish some of the innovations of that game had been ported into the older one, even if it were as DLC. Also new campaigns and battles, but I fear it is too late to see this game updated. I am a bit sceptic for the next iteration of the series portraying the American War of Independence, mostly the new strategic play. A game on the Napoleonic Wars, or maybe the Seven Years Wars in Europe in this system would be interesting as well.",1689798934,1689798934,True,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False

Personally I do have a lot of fun playing this game but I will say it is flawed. The game mechanics and how the game functions during campaign are some of the larger issues I found personally. 

     For instance, flanking is huge in this game like in many other strategy games but the area in which a unit gets flanked is huge. On many occasions I have had units rout from ""flanking"" when they are only being hit from the front (usually when the unit is being attacked by cavalry). 

     In addition to this skirmishing lines will refuse orders. In almost all my battles I will make large lines of skirmishing units in order to attack or hold a position in order to slow the enemy advance but when order to engage a unit my skirmishers will fallback to reload. This gets to be very annoying especially when I don't want to put them in the ""hold"" mode so they can rotate and engage another unit. 

     Other flaws within the game mechanics is how  on harder modes if the AI has a number advantage they will just constantly charge your units until they take the objective. In campaigns for the South you are almost always at a disadvantage and to be constantly charge with no regard for true strategic maneuvers is just tedious, repetitive and discouraging. 

     Now, some of these problems would be easier to dismiss if I could deploy my army exactly how I wanted. I appreciate being able to choose a few units at the start of a mission but then to just throw the rest of my army into over stretched or not so favorable positions gets to be upsetting. I believe if in a campaign mission the player should be allowed access to the full map, deploy their army as they so desire and time their attacks as they see fit. The player shouldn't be restricted to such small squares just for the map to open and leave gaps in the line or for the mission to continue into another day and bring you into a disorganized mess of what was your army. These simple flaws within the game play really take a toll on how you can play. These issues often prevent me from being able to try new armies or replay a campaign altogether. 

     If you seek a semi-historical game with an almost Napoleonic style of strategy then by all means I encourage you try this game. This game is unique and offers more detail than many others and is still undoubtedly one of the best strategy games out there.  However, I must emphasize and warn how the AI and in game mechanics may foil your plans or discourage you from continuing.",1689309892,1689309892,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For example, you don't want to tell an engaged unit to move backwards by clicking behind them because they turn around and get slaughtered, you should have them fall back first. 
I don't of any other games that really accomplish this level of simulation of Napoleonic battlefield tactics.

It's not the execution, but the idea that makes it great. Scale is perfect, building your army makes each campaign different. But that's when the game works. But even with years of updates and many more years of extensive modding, the AI, and the event triggers, etc. are still often times broken or buggy, seemingly hardcoded to maximize misery.

Example 1: Don't save your game during battle! It ""resets"" the AI when you load it, meaning they might throw away their entire army on a mass charge up a fortified ridge, turning an interesting battle into a boring cleanup on aisle 5, or magically get their morale and stamina reset, allowing them go from helplessly routing off the map, to taking on multiple brigades of your at once single-handedly, as they turn and face their demons and win the war, all in the blink of an eye. This doesn't happen normally when playing a battle... except for phase changes in battles and after loading a save, which unfortunately, happens a lot.

Example 2: You've taken the final victory point! The enemy is 95% destroyed and you're breaking out your victory cigar. Except you needed to take the victory point  1 hour before the battle ends, and you took it 56 minutes before it ends. So, actually, you lose and you have to re-fight the entire battle if you don't want to mess up your entire campaign. Or not! Maybe you take the victory point and the battle is half over, with tons of time left on the clock, except you win this time! You didn't even have a chance to whittle down the enemy on the map, so the next battle, they'll have a 50% bigger army! Good luck figuring out which way you'll get kicked in the teeth without fighting each battle several times and taking notes. Wish I was joking.

The BG mode does not make the AI smarter or anything it just gives them a massive amount of overpowered units (all 3 stars).",1686370984,1686370984,True,7,0,0.582604646682739258,0,True,False,False

Really love this game and wish I could recomend it, sadly with all the bugs I cant, firstly there's the AI which HAS to be micro managed as your troops will do their very best to get themselves killed!  flanking idea is a fucking joke! and your troops once again wish to get themselves flanked at every given moment, even when there is no one around? cavalry rush through your lines as if they weren't there and run around behind your lines making sure you have to divide your troops to chase them!  Troops ignore your commands and go and do what they want, usually that means walking into canister shot......the most annoying, the AI team has the ability to move your troops for you? yes! they will pull your troops out into melee even if your troops are further away and set to ""hold""   The AI is advertised as ""intelligent"" it is actually ""psychic"" many a time have I aimed my skirmishers at the enemy's skirmishers to have the aim line redirected elsewhere while they run away, the same with cavalry, making sure you have to click many times just to get them to shoot at at whom you wish, by this time they are safely away and for this mechanic? the developers really suck!!!!!

Antietam and Shiloh are just a joke!!!! The AI loves having little tantrums like rushing you if it loses :D
I've put in many hours and the developers make no changes to these bugs....so unless on sale....DON'T BUY IT!

The game is well thought through on every level but the bugs that are just......off putting, perhaps the devs should not breed, game has tantrums....devs need a punch in the face",1532032949,1686192953,False,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

I played it when it first came out and could not believe how bare bones it is compared to a full-fledged A-list title. Sure, this is not an A-list title, but let me give you my reasoning. 

I am in my 50's. I've played strategy games for 40 years, including the 1/2 inch counter boring old board games like Squad Leader, PC games like Total War (all iterations). I would consider myself a grognard of strategy games. I also have some minimal standards. 

Put all this into perspective when I give you ONE game breaking flaw in the game. In the first scenario, you are to take a town. You order a unit of men into some buildings which supposedly give 200% cover. Moments later you see them dropping like flies because half of them are not in the building and are getting shot to pieces. The flaw in the game is you cannot change the unit formation. A unit of soldiers is a rectangle and the building is square, so some of the men don't fit. Wow that is just absolutely stupid and alone breaks the game for me. I cannot use any actual strategy. 

There are historical attempts at naming units, commanders, weapons, and so forth. But that's where the realism stops. Nothing in the game is realistic and it is all prescripted so the time is always rushing you into positions you have not pre-memorized. It's total nonsense from a tactical standpoint. I cannot scout with cavalry for even two minutes without wasting half the scenario's time limit.

I like that you can customize the troop names, outfit them with what you want. But if you want any sort of challenge, this game is impossible. The difficulty for this game is either way to easy or literally impossible. The amount of troops you receive after a battle is literally not enough to complete a campaign. The game can't expect you to reasonably complete a campaign if after the battle of Chancellorsville, a battle where both sides took around 20k casualties, you only receive 11k troops for a draw.

The game lets you be the commander of a army.
your army is loyal to the Confederate South or The Federal North.
in this game you can create your own army and rewrite history by winning or losing battles, these battles gives you monney and manpower that you can use to make your army better.
During battles it feels if you are the leading comander of that battle, during the battle you do not have the information of the field, not knowing where the enemy is.

During battles you can feel that the enemy wants to push forward and complete their objective (in a historical way)
the gunfire and the screaming of chargeing men, the canon fire that can destroy enemy brigades in minutes.
this game is only in singelplayer unlike Ultimate General Gettysburg.

I recomend this game to those that like Historical strategy games.
This game is not kind in the begining mission of the North and South altough the Nord is mutch harder it shows that the north is not better than the south because they have more men, this is shown in the first battle of bull run, the south does get some manpower problems if you get past the second battle of bull run

The first Union battle, Battle of Philippi, put you up against 3.5k Confederates while you have 2.5k. Historically Battle of Philippi the Union had 3k and the Confederates had 800. Potomac Fort as far as I could find did not have a battle outside of the naval engagement and it ended indecisively. So the game saying ""Experience the bloodiest period of U.S. history"" is really pushing what it means to experience history. Yeah its no fun having 2 minor engagements to start the game where its basically a cake walk.

AI is also pretty bad. You know I can take my time engage in an artillery Exchange. Then enemy will shell me with 1 or 2 artillery in which my men are in 100% cover and all together lose about 100 men, The enemy with me shelling 3+ in no cover will lose 80 men across the same number of regiments that I have.  I think the most annoying about the AI, on normal where no buffs exist, the Enemy will not break. I will have superior numbers, have my flanks cover and do a general charge, and all of my forces get routed. I can even take out the general there seems to be no penalty on the enemy. I would expect that if nothing else the enemy would suffer like a organization penalty like maybe their units move more sporadically or are less effective chasing your men down.

I think my last complaint is the controls. I try to box select and I end up moving my unit. Or I will just be unable to select units at times that aren't retreating or fleeing. I also can't form ""solid"" defensive lines. What I mean by that is for the most part is you can tell your units where to go but its really difficult to move 1 unit. So I end up moving two or three just because its less tedious. If I want to move Williams I should not have to do that annoying left click drag movement, That is what I select my units with why would I do it. I am ngl I did a test on Picket Charge custom battle as both Union and Confederate, Put all my units on AI and just sate back and watched the battle. I watched several instances where the AI inflict a Flank from Artillery bombing. I have also witnessed how the AI will turn to intentionally inflict a flank and then go back to who ever they were shooting. I am not even talking about a turn flank I mean we will have to lines shooting at each other the AI slightly turns inflicts a flank and turns back, but the unit turning doesn't receive any flanking. in these same scenarios I have also seen a regiment of 2100 will lose 800 men in 76% cover (in a defensive position you put your unit into) and gets routed from a charge, but the enemy with 1 artillery and and a force 1600, will lose 400 men in 50% cover (on a open piece of field with either end of the regiment dipping into wood areas) and would not only route the initial Regiment charge but would route a force 1000 coming to help the initial regiment with 1 volley from the infantry.

As awful as this is to say, I believe the best way to play this is with a mod or the Trainer and yes there are other games Like Hearts of Iron that really are better with mods, but those games have a solid foundation to build off of. This seems like it was almost made to be played with a mod in mind and it baffles me there isn't even a workshop for it.

I will say the game is not bad, just never play off of casual and don't get your hopes up on playing relatively historically accurate engagements. If you are wanting fun line battles and very slow movement being careful of everything you do well this is the game for you, but just realize AI is given some extra benefits and some benefits of the doubt you do not get on normal and that controls might actually fight you at times. So I can't recommend but I can't not recommend. 

It is really up to you, I have played more broken games like the Tom Clancy Endwar but I had/have more fun in those than playing this since the AI doesn't feel like its cheating.

Edit: I feel like it would be good if I added, I have fond memories of a strategy game based on the civil war when you still for the most part bought these type of games in a box and had to install with a disk, and I was hoping this would live up to that.",1677975855,1677977051,False,0,1,0,1,True,False,False

Here you command and manage an army and all the ins and outs of it, but that's it. You don't move a chess piece around the map deciding which particular part of the south you feel like burning down that day, you're given a set of missions that you can choose which order you do them, usually with a larger battle meant to cap off that part of the campaign, and then you're given another set. Instead all of the big long term strategic decision making is focused on how you organize your soldiers.

You have control over how large you want your regiments to be, whether or not they're regular infantry, skirmishers, cavalry, or artillery, what specific weapon they use, who commands the regiment, what perks they get, whether or not you want to staff the unit with expensive veterans or cheap rookies that lower its stats, even what the unit is named when you move it around the battlefield. Your army and what you do with it is persistent, and only rarely do units that aren't yours show up for you to control. This leads to fun moments during missions when reinforcements show up, and its YOUR guys who arrive, not some nobodies spawned just for that mission who will never be seen again. Similarly, for the larger battles that take place over multiple days, the opposing side's regiments will persist as well, and if beaten to the point of being ineffective or outright annihilated, will not be replaced.

Battles can end in draws, or defeat, and the game keeps going, because the long term campaign is about managing the war instead of winning every single battle (though you can do that). How well you do effects your reputation, which can give your soldiers a morale boost or penalty depending on how low or high it is, and can let you commission more gear from the government without paying cash for it. The game is less about ""WE NEED TO WIN THE WAR TO SAVE/DESTROY AMERICA"" and more about ""Man, I gotta do good or I'll lose my job!"".

Theres some clunky parts as well however. Sometimes when my soldiers were routing they froze in the worst possible place instead of running and got shredded. I would see regiments ready to fire instead be stuck in an infinite reload while getting shot. Cavalry is effective when you could micromanage it but somewhat frustrating to use as it would move without being ordered. You can't swap weapons between units, so unless you have enough guns or cash to completely replace the weapon for every single soldier in that unit you're out of luck.

I give it a tentative recommendation: I liked it once I got used to it, but it might not be what others are looking for.",1676632358,1676632358,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Not that there is anything wrong with SMG, Ultimate General Civil War takes it one step further.  The graphics are superb and the ability to build your own brigades and corps make it a lot of fun in that you can still play historical battles, but this time create your own tactics to create different historical results.  The units work and move flawlessly and once you discover all the nuances there is nothing you cannot do.  I like the fact that you have to look after your troops and watch them grow and become veterans, while you sacrifice your AI reinforcements.  My only heartburn is with the scaling.  Its is not always historically accurate and the enemy can sometimes out number you by 20 or 30%.  On Civil War Battlefield that can make all the difference between victory and defeat.

Pros:
- Ability to do custom battles and scenarios
- UI looks great
- Ability to move your armies is solid

Cons:
- Successfully taking an objective in story mode and then have the game load the next scenario telling you that you failed to take it and that you have to retake an already achieved objective is absurd.
- There should be more custom options for custom battles.  The ability to continue fighting past the time limit is such an easy thing that could be implemented.
- Story mode will just move your units around at random between scenarios

Firstly the morale system is 100% broken. You get flanked and lose 40 soldiers and your men flee. You flank the enemy on two sides, killing 200 in a single volley and the enemy stands and gives you a volley where your men then flee. Its infuriating. You try and  use tactics to win the battle but the broken system means the ONLY way to win is to have numerical superiority at EVERY point to kill more enemy then you lose, and then pray even then your men dont flee. I have had battles where I have killed 3 enemies for every one of mine and yet still almost lost because of the morale system (This was when playing as the Union too so it makes even less sense for the confederates to take that kind of casualties and still almost won). If there is a 1 vs 1 you WILL lose because your men will break and flee. I have seen a troop of 200 skirmishers in the open rout a brigade of 2000 infantry that were in cover. Thats insane. 

Second big issue is the invisible enemy troops. You will take long range artillery fire, sometimes at the start of the battle, even though you cant see the enemy. Massive units of thousands will come out of the woods out of nowhere, just meters in front of your men. Add to that the broken morale system and you get a surprise melee charge that routs your superior force. You cant plan a battle, you just react to the battle. Which I guess is somewhat accurate to real life, but this isnt a realistic battle simulator. There has to be the ability to see the enemy before they are literally on top of you. As shown by the fact the enemy can see you at the start of the game, clearly the AI has the advantage there. 

This game is so close to being awesome. But the totally broken morale system alone makes some battles essentially unwinable. If I wanted to lose battles my side actually lost in real life I would join a reenactor troop. If I lose because of bad strategy fine. Its when I lose only because of a broken core gameplay mechanic that it becomes an issue.",1608399580,1673884289,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you don't put thought into your strategy then the AI will have your troops running in panic from the battlefield in no time.

- Use large infantry formations as your main element for holding positions or pushing back the enemy. Don't make them walk about too much, just use [spacebar] to hold position so they can reload and let the opponent have it.
- Use skirmishers in forest cover to snipe at the enemy formations and generally increase their level of friction.
- Use cavalry in open terrain to chase down the enemy and inflict heavy casualties once they start routing.
- Keep your cannons well back and bombard the large enemy formations continuously.
- Keep a supply wagon moving between the lines to reload ammo.
- Don't bother chasing down the enemy general - it accomplishes nothing much.

It is still the best ""War Between the States"" themed game that combines both Grand Strategy and Real Time Tactics.

It is a mixture between ""Grant, Lee, Sherman: Civil War Generals 2"" (from Sierra On-Line) and ""Sid Meier's Gettysburg!"" (from Firaxis), both from 1997. UGCW almost feels like a 20-years-later sequel... Now, if you've played those, you simply can't deny that UGCW was heavily influenced by both of these older gems.

UGCW It's also a fantastic game for experimenting with mods (available online) to make it more realistic.

There are only 5 things that I personally find completely wrong and that I deeply regret:

1. All units keep on firing even when they've completely run out of ammo.
2. There is NO OPEN SOURCE CODE available to further customize it, like with uniforms, headgear, or sounds.
3. There is NO MAP EDITOR, so there is no way to create both custom and non-included historical battles. 
4. Despite its ""inclusion of the whole war,"" there's a lack of many more campaigns and the battles within, like the exclusion of the colorful (and very vast) Trans-Mississippi Theater, and from that one you'll only get the Battles of Prairie Grove and Mansfield.
5. The critical flaw: NO MULTI-PLAYER! Just unbelievable!!

Other than that, this game is very well designed and very addictive. It's just a good old game.

Here are some comparisons:
-you start off as an officer with about 8 units in a battle rather than controlling an entire kingdom or Empire.
-the controls will take some gettin used to.
-In Total War your troops are re-trained automatically or you simply re-train them in your settlement whereas in this game, you will need to have a weapon, a recruit, and enough money for each unit you train or re-train.  This makes you care about your men more.  One of the reviewers said that the choices don't matter.  He might have a point.
-bad AI just like Total War(I think)
-no Total War style campaign map.  This game focuses on the battles.
-Less unit variety

If you are for some reason on the road and stuck with some garbage laptop that you use for work or something, and if you’re a hardcore RTS gamer, THIS GAME IS PERFECT! 

Even on some 2018 windows workbook with like 2 gb RAM, integrated graphics, and an i5, you can run this game at max settings. On top of that, the graphics are delectable. They’re like one of those old civil war paintings. The musket fire plumes look delicious and all the little hills and trees are so impressionistic. You can just pause sometimes and marvel in awe at all the battlefield chaos, cannons cannons lobbing ordinance atop a ridge line from 400 yards out, then the loaders getting around the front and stuffing the barrel, infantry caught up having formed some jagged frontline after they’ve responded to and attempted flanks on flanks, some bayonet brawl between thousands of troops in the center of the map as they’re clawing their way out of a valley that’s turned into a kill hole… spectacular. 

The sound really cranks things up, the rifles, cannons, and muffled shouting of troops all harmonizing in a quite morbidly comforting wash of Civil War ASMR. The music is sort of just stereotypical Civil War violins and stuff, so it suffices. 

The reason I said it’s for hardcore RTS players or Grand Strat players is because this game is deep af. I still haven’t figured it all out. Infantry do the vast majority of the work, with their main purpose being to establish the line of engagement with the enemy. You clash as far up against the opponent as you can get, then reninforce those flanks until you’re strung out. Then you identify bottlenecks and choke points, prodding at where the enemy is weak or routing, and reinforcing lines of yours that are getting pressured . It’s a thrilling push and pull. 

Artillery can seem lackluster, but you gotta get close with it. Cavalry are much more realistic in their utility when comparing their role in, say, the total war games. A cavalry unit committing to the wrong charge at the wrong time will disappear in seconds. A cavalry unit executing the perfect charge at the perfect time will take care of most problems within the blink of an eye. 

The scale of combat is unique, with you commanding over vast ranges on multiple fronts, often with little sense of battlefield control or cohesion. A division may be combatting enemy presence that is far west of the main opposing force, approaching eastbound, meaning that you’re commanding troops moving in the opposite direction of the main enemy far behind their lines.

502520,125481667,76561198010299955,0,108,1503,0,563,1669020611,"This is a great army and tactics management game, you can align your troop makeups to match your personal style, though I would always recommend bringing infantry with artillery, and then you can equip those units with different firearms, and decide whether or not to bring supply wagons to sustain ammo reserves mid battle. 

It's a difficult, if ultimately enjoyable game, and the company seems focused on their ultimate admiral series, which I have to assume is also good, but I'd like them to take this concept and bring other conflicts like the crimean war, the franco-prussian war, and even the napoleonic conflicts into this type of game experience, and honestly I wouldn't mind them meshing it with ultimate admiral to bring it all together.

This game however remains a fantastic way to re-enact the civil war, you can either try to repeat or, improve, the twists of history as the Union, or you can challenge yourself to a test of survival as the rebels, both offer challenging gameplay scenarios, with a compelling level of personalisation for your army corps.

Then I would play Close Combat games and loved those too. This game combines both of those into one. You have the subject of the civil war combined with the playability of Close Combat. It's simply awesome. Now I will say, the difficulty is a little intense. Even on the lowest difficulty, the enemy always outnumbers you. For instance, when I play with Union on the opening mission, you're surrounded by Confederates and are easily out numbered 3 units to 1 at almost all times. But then when you play confederate, the union on the same mission then outnumbers you 3 to 1. It makes no sense, and the historical realism isn't there. It's really just a challenge based game. Which this I am okay with, but I will say it makes the other features pretty much pointless. For instance, I can buy tons of units. I had 60k on the field once. But then, even on the easiest difficulty, the enemy not only outnumbered me, but for whatever reason, I'd lose like 200 men in a 2500 man unit, and they would run away scared, but the enemy would lose 1000 from a 1500 man unit and push forward.",1667444421,1667444421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has some not-so-great design choices around enemy scaling to the size of your forces and it's kinda lame that the course of the war doesn't change at all based on the results of the battles. The AI is also pretty easy to cheese in the vanilla version of the game.

The campaign could also use a little more freedom, maybe more like the ACW mod for Empire:TW. 
As with any game, there are some issues, some worse than others. the three that bug me the most are as follows.
1- Emeny units routing through my lines and attacking my artillery and supplies, or just capturing the objectives at the last minute. This is incredibly frustrasting when in one battle every enemy routs away from your army, then suddenly they rout through multiple brigades, or completely surrounded and running through many units and reforming way faster than your units ever reform. 
2- Enemy cavalry- These guys are ridiculously bugged, from riding through brigades and not being engaged in melee to being completely invisible as they charge your artillery across an open field. You can hear them but not see them until your units open fire, a little too late. 
3- Enemy charging and wheeling speed: the fist one is really just a pet peeve, only toward the end of the war did multiple regiments rush enemy positions one after another in rapid succession. The wheeling speed is kinda dumb though, enemy units constantly wheel and reverse almost instantly, but it takes your units forever to do either one. Just make it even across the board.

It can be kind of difficult at the Major General level for most players but Colonel level will provide a challenge for most beginners while not being overwhelming.  It is probably easier to play the Union side since they generally have more access to troops, weapons and gold.  The Confederate side has better generals and more experienced units to make up the difference but you need to preserve your army during the course of the game to have much chance near the end - sometimes a draw is okay (in the campaign) if it means preserving your army for another battle.  Just don't lose too many battles or you will lose your command and end the campaign.

I also enjoy the control and flexibility in how you get to put together and equip your army between battles.  There are already some excellent resources out there so I won't discuss them here.

[u]Here are a few tips:[/u]
-- [b]Don't let your units take fire from their rear or flanks[/b] - it doesn't take much to rout troops that are being flanked especially if they lack experience (which usually means lower morale and endurance).  Conversely, [b]hit your enemy's flanks hard as much as you can and try to roll up their line.[/b] 
-- [b]Use your skirmishers often [/b]- They have many uses:  better visibility of enemy movements, can slow down a much larger enemy force especially in difficult terrain which can buy you time or help protect your flanks, as a meat shield when charging enemy positions (I lead with the skirmishers and let them soak up the bullets with the full brigade right behind them).
-- [b]Artillery can be devastating or ineffective depending on what you use and how you use it[/b] - howitzers and Napoleans are very effective at short range against targets in the open but much less against units at a distance or in cover; parrot guns are great a longer ranges against enemy artillery but don't do much against troops at close range.  Artillery uses ammo fast so be sure to only fire when effective.
-- [b]For campaigns, preserving your army for the long haul is key. [/b] Don't waste troops if you already meet the victory conditions. 
-- [b]Veteran troops are expensive to replace so know when and how to use them.[/b]

I could go on and on but these few points are something to keep in mind from the start.

The campaign feels great for the first 6 hours or so, and I loved building up my own army, that whole feature is a nice touch. But you soon get a sense that the campaign is monstrously unfair. Seemingly no matter how many battles you win, no matter how badly you obliterate the enemy army, they keep coming at you with more.

It's a very steep learning curve, there is no real tutorial. Having said that, I really like the battle mechanics and the sounds etc. are excellent. The graphics are displayed nicely but I would have to agree with some of the players who express frustration that the campaign really does not reward battlefiled victories with political and economic bonuses. The other issue is the timed battles. Each battle has a timer and if you do not get your objectives within the time limit, then that can lead to numerous defeats. I am playing as the Confederates and am up to The Wilderness Campaign but if I am brutally honest, the whole thing is becoming very grindy. Yet again i am faced with overwhelming Union odds and I am on the point of giving up the Confederate campaign completely. As many people have said in previous reviews, there are some battles that would have , historically, enabled foreign powers to come in on the side of the confederacy. It is a real shame, because battles wise this is a great little game. Whether or not I would recommend the game to others is actually a difficult question. At first the gripes that I have seem minor, but when you are deep into the campaign, it just seems so much of an effort to beat the timer with what you have available. If there was no timer, then I would have time and space to really try different tactics, flanking methods, tactical retreat to draw the opposing forces into an ambush. I have said no to recommending the game. I can't point out all these faults and say yes get it.

-Advantages and disadvantages seem to mean absolutely NOTHING. My men will have a moral boost and the enemy a neg or mine will be vets and be a much larger force yet mine will always break first. 
-Different levels give the enemy the fortification buff even when they are NOT in a fortification. The battle of bull run 2nd day is a perfect example, where the destroyed rail road is apparently the most powerful defense you can have. I sit and watch my 2, 2star, 2k veterens get completely demolished by 1100 Confeds sitting in the open. 
-Despite what the stats say when you buy them, picking Veterans seems to change nothing in the battle. They seem to break and rout just as fast as the newbs.
-Charge distance is really short...... Except for the AI who will start a charge from a quarter mile and somehow not run out of stamina
-I randomly loose control of units even though they didn't route or panic.
-Units will ignore commands you give either to move somewhere or to attack something, sometimes they even just spin in a circle and get flanked and rout it is such a retarded AI.
-The FLANKED feature is VERY annoying because showing just a tiny portion of a unit's side often is enough to trigger this debuff that RAPIDLY causes you units to loose moral and flee.
-Units will ignore your targeting commands and change targets, which often lead to your formations rotating to face something else and activating the FLANKED debuff.
-There is supposed to be a capture mechanic when you either surround a unit or break them with enough units...... This mechanic rarely works and will instead cause the enemy to glitch around and disappear.
-Cav units have magical powers that allow them to pass through huge infantry blocks and capture things that the infantry are actually sitting on.
-There have been several battles where units will spawn right in front of you...... doesn't matter that you may be on a hill with the view or a completely flat field.
-The controls are so lacking it can get frustrating.

My final thought is that the game is fun but some of the bugs and AI utter retardation combined with a lack of controls add a level of annoyance that can build up VERY quickly.

Your task in each battle is to capture or defend key positions within a time limit. This shapes where the action is concentrated and forces one side onto the offensive. Terrain features like forests, farmhouses, and river crossings affect how the units move and fight. You will usually have to plan your assault or defense around local strong points, like a hill dominating a stream crossing or a forest's edge overlooking open fields. This type of 'battle planning' feels more fun and realistic than the typical TW (total war) battle.

In battle, you have full control of each deployed brigade in your army, except when they are wavering/routing. Brigades that do rout will always eventually recover (no shattered retreat status) unless they get totally destroyed or captured. Your brigades are mostly infantry, but you will also have brigades of artillery, cavalry, and skirmishers/snipers. You usually choose a few brigades to begin the battle with, and receive more of the army later as reinforcements. Like in TW, you give commands to each unit (go here, attack these guys, face that way), and they will follow your commands as long as they are able. You actually get a few more commands than TW gives you, and they are really good additions. First, you can draw a specific path for a unit to take from A to B just by dragging the mouse. This lets you avoid hazards or execute flawless flanking maneuvers. Second, you can fall back by pressing a button. This has your unit retreat a short distance while still facing the same direction - returning to safety while avoiding the massive morale impact of an attack in the rear. Third, you can detach skirmishers from infantry brigades. This creates a brand new, fully controllable small unit that is perfect for scouting and harassing the enemy, at the cost of weakening the original brigade. 

The addition of these new commands gives a lot of depth to gameplay. For example, you might detach skirmishers and send them across a river to the edge of a forest to scout for enemies. When the enemy is spotted, you can begin to concentrate your brigades to defend the area where the enemy will be, before you are already under fire. You have your skirmishers fire a volley at the advancing enemy, then fall back into the dense forest before they are hit with return fire. Keeping your skirmishers at the flanks of your main force, you screen against possible flank attacks as you move your cavalry into position to flank the enemy or go behind their mainline in pursuit of undefended artillery. In the middle of your line, the enemy has concentrated their force and a charge has broken your line. They rush to exploit the opening, and you must decide whether to pull the entire force back to a new defensive position or attempt a counterattack to plug the gap. 

My only real gripe is that in career mode you are restricted to the real historical battles of the civil war - so after 2nd Bull Run, the next battle will always be Antietam regardless of who won. The developers have painstakingly modelled every major battle after the real terrain and features of the historical battlefields, so I get why they couldn't do this for imaginary battles too.",1661460865,1661460865,True,9,1,0.627392470836639404,0,True,False,False

During a long campaign you manage retreats, flank the hell out of you enemy, despair, succeed, lead cavalry charges, hold the line till reinforcements arrive and breach enemy fortifications.
So I'd rate it a 9/10.

You will most likely enjoy the game if...
- you enjoy tactical challenges and (slow) RTS - the focus is on strategy and tactics rather than reactions and speed
- you are interested in the theme (American Civil war) or want to learn about it.

Pros:
+ Really fun tactical battles, finds a good balance between challenging enough and  allowing success. 
(I played my first playthrough on ""Easy"" and am playing the normal difficulty campaign right now - am not a hardcore gamer)
+ Good Level design with goals and strategical points to fight for. I especially like that you can draw battles, when both sides reached part of their goals.
+ Historically accurate for a computer game, contains the original generals who fought the war and recreates the battles of the civil war,  the weapons used are accurate as far as I can tell. Learned a lot about it during my playthrough
+ Good amount of content for the money. There are enough campaign battles, some lasting several days and vast maps, some small skirmishes. Bought it for about 14,- € on sale and its worth it easily
+ No major bugs or crashes 
+ Good campaign where your army grows and battles effect the strength further down the road 
+ Good audio (fitting music, voicing of orders accepted and such, creates good atmosphere)

Cons: 
- Sometimes unit management can be annoying (when they block each others lines, fall back into the wrong direction...). But those are minor issues. Game mechanics work well overall
- It is not a sandbox game. The battles are mostly scripted and a timer limits the possibilities of creativly finding ways to solve a problem - sometimes you just have to stick to the plan.
- Relativly few embellishments, straightforward (like a startup or winning video, reactions of poltics and society to the outcome of your battle, not real tutorial)

From what I've seen from play throughs and heard from other players, the enemy team generally matches your force no matter what.

For example, if I'm the South and I bring 10,000 troops, the North will bring 30,000 troops. If I were to bring 50,000 troops on the same battle, the North will bring 150,000 troops. (Generally speaking).  This punishes the player for managing their Army well, good tactics, and negates progress.
It also doesn't allow for too much historical manipulation. When I play a game like this, I want to determine the entire outcome myself.

While it's neat to let your troops follow a general command, often they do really stupid things that get your army flanked for no reason. If your troops ever turn around for any reason, you get flanked, but if the AI does the same thing you get no bonus. The rules don't seem to make sense without looking up guides and reading manuals. 

If you're not spending all your money on spamming as many troops as possible, the AI will bring more and more army until you're so outnumbered, no amount of planning can help you win. 100k army against 20k army is very difficult even on the lowest setting. 

Artillery misses almost every shot. Unless you can shoot them for 5 minutes in an open field, it just doesn't seem worth bringing compared to the hundreds of rifles you can get instead. 

Cavalry hardly ever gets flanking bonus, because the AI just doesn't seem to be able to get flanked. I've had them engaged head on with a rifle squad, and the cavalry DIRECTLY behind a squad all on it's own. The squad turned, wiped out my cav, and then turned to engage my troops again. No flank, no rear hits.

You decide which groups receive veteran or rookie replacements, maintaining or diminishing their experience as a result. Even deeper then that you manage funds which are used to outfit your divisions with specific weaponry, giving them an edge on the battlefield, but also increasing the risk associated with losing more expensive weaponry. The campaign is fun, union and confederate campaigns have the same major battles but different minor battles, keeping both campaigns fresh and desirable to play. At 25 hours, I can say this game is well worth the money and I plan on putting many more hours in this title. 
I do have a couple of gripes, cavalry seem to have a mind of their own and require constant micromanaging to be effective. Some of the main battles are split into portions (to remain historical i know), but they do things like encourage you to push a position while you have a defense objective, if you are successful in taking said objective, it doesn't matter as the next day will load in and all your men will be back at the line they're supposed to be holding. This forces you to retake all the ground you had already split blood over.
Those gripes aside this is the most fun I've had when it comes to a strategy game in this setting and I highly recommend it to anyone who is even remotely interested in a civil war RTS.

No true campaign, core mechanics suck, bugs galore, no unit variety, pointless equipment, Boring game play, no difficulty except AI has more units. Units don't break, just retreat then come back.


This game has a ton of issues at its core The campaign is not a true campaign, just set piece battles that have two minor battles and one major one. units do not break, they just retreat a little ways and then return, so in a battle you can ""rout"" an enemy force, then they will suddenly show up behind you and rout your units. Units will ignore commands. The battles have a timer that the battle revolves around, if you run out of time you can continue but the battle will randomly end. The difficulty is done through the enemy having more units than you and the units not breaking. Some battles will have small sections of the map available, then zoom you to another separated section, then randomly go back even though the objective hasn't been secured. the map will then open up and you will have three minutes to organize both armies and attack a finale objective. Overall, the game has major core game play issues, bugs that allow objectives to glitch outside the map, the difficulty comes from fighting the bugs and bad game play.",1659302571,1659302571,False,5,3,0.510125577449798584,0,True,False,False

I grew up playing two Gettysburg games in the 1990s, one simply titled ""Gettysburg"" that had movie footage from Gettysburg mixed in with its 2D pixel troops and aerial view of the battlefield. I also played ""Sid Meier's Gettysberg!"", which had an isometric view of the battlefield with the battle of Gettysburg split up into smaller battles over the three days. I later got the ""Ultimate General: Gettysburg"" and played it a little bit before getting frustrated with the dodgy controls, poor AI, and horrendous pathfiding.

Ultimate General: Civil War allows for you to become an officer at the start of the Civil War. With limited troops at your command you go through the great engagements of the Civil War and several smaller skirmishes building up your reputation as a commander and potentially altering the course of the war. As you complete battles you get experience which allows you to expand your capacity to command more troops and have access to cheaper arms and more manpower to fill your depleted ranks. This part of the game is fairly well done and shows the pressure a commander can be under when dealing with limited resources. It's once you get to the battlefield where the glaring problems with the game exist.

I have several issues with the AI, pathfinding, UI, and line-of-sight in the game. The topography of the maps is not always clear and sometimes when you have troops cresting a hill and looking down into the area below, somehow the game says they can't see down the hill. You have to physically start moving down the hill to see down the hill. Sometimes you are on what appears to be flat ground in open fields, but for some reason the ground in front of you is shrouded in the fog of war and troops that seem like they would be easily visible suddenly pop out as if they were invisible and ambush your unit. Vision being broken by forest is sometimes odd as a unit that would still be visible as it enters the forest suddenly goes invisible and breaks line-of-sight and you have to physically go into the forest to see the unit you were attacking again. When moving units as a division, the units behave erratically when moving into position. Skirmishers, for instance, will run and completely ignore units in front of them until they get to their designated position or until they are engaged in melee combat with another unit. If you control the skirmishers on their own, they walk until someone is in range of their arms (usually the extreme range) and will shoot at anything and not focus targets, swing around, firing at any unit that gets anywhere close in range. You have to force them to not fire to move into a more advantageous position. There needs to be a middle ground somewhere to give more options for unit behavior, like when to engage, what range to engage. Cavalry with carbines and sabers also seem to not want to use their firearms and will only use them randomly. I try to move the cavalry into position to fire, but they just stand there and do nothing. I try to move them closer, they just stand there and do nothing, or retreat if someone looks at them. There's no way to select what weapon to prefer when attacking, at least not one that is readily visible or available. It pretty much makes your cavalry a melee only or ranged only unit. The AI also sometimes makes some very strange decisions. On one map, I was defending a hill next to a river with several units and the AI kept hitting the same spot over and over again without any success. The AI seems to laser focus on a single position and will attempt to move units out of that position without regard to any other option, regardless of loss.

The campaign also has some issues with regard to alternate history. It's not advanced enough to take into consideration battles won versus lost and how that could impact the outcome of the war. Also generals cannot be ""killed"" on the battlefield, even if you do manage to remove them from the map. Officers dying on the battlefield was not uncommon and it should have been factored into the game. The game should have also factored in the outcome of battles and created alternate scenarios to fight in to either accelerate or lengthen the end of the war. The Historical Battles option in the game could be used for players who want to reenact their favorite moments from the historical war. If they make a sequel, I hope they can make a more expansive campaign.

For an indie title, it is not bad. It can provide a lot of fun and can scratch that itch if you are in that Civil War mood. I cannot recommend it to people who are not Civil War buffs or who are strategy fans in general. I think it is made for a niche audience and it does an adequate job.

The battles are meaty and feel great. Most of the American Civil War games out there do the scale of battles correctly, but without the oomph of musket fire and cannons. This game does that part very well. Battles feel visceral. You can almost feel the cannons shredding through lines of troops, you get a twinge in your stomach while feeding your men into the meat grinder on an assault. You can feel them get cut down by volleys of musket fire but you press them on because you must take that hill dammit. 

The AI is also fun to fight. They will try to flank, they will exploit weak spots in your line, and in general give you a run for your money. If you are like me you'll find yourself often beating the enemy by small margins. Every victory feels well earned, which in turn makes the few times I've dominated the enemy or pulled off an encirclement or heroic flank all the more rewarding. 

Civil War battles were a bloody, grinding mess. It was volunteer army against volunteer army, and everyone who paid attention in history class knows that the tactics had not yet caught up with the technology (for the most part). The game gets the feel of Civil War battles so, so right.

My one gripe with the historical accuracy of the game is that it does not really simulate actual Civil War command structure. It would have been cool to have Sherman for instance as a Brigadier General commanding a division, with Colonels under him commanding brigades, and regiments under those brigades. It's a minor gripe, but I'm a Civil War nerd and I love those details. That being said I found myself easily overlooking that abstraction because the battles felt. so. good. Seriously I have played all the Civil War games and the way the battles feel in this one just can't be matched.

Here's the bad. The campaign missions are highly scripted and make what should be more of a simulator game feel very gamey. The first campaign I ran as the Union I beat the Confederates pretty well at Bull Run, won the side mission battles, and was feeling good about myself. I ended up losing badly at Shiloh not because I did anything tactically wrong, but because I underestimated the size of the units the Confederates would have at that stage of the war. My men were just outnumbered. This didn't bother me. I love hard games. I love learning from my mistakes. So I took the lesson that you should build brigades deep and not wide and loaded up a second campaign. 

Everything was going great the second time around. I beefed up my units. We encircled the Confederates at Bull Run and I ended up capturing the entire Stonewall brigade. I went into the Battle of Shiloh with 1200 men to an Infantry unit at minimum.

This time around Shiloh was a tough fight, but we held the Confederate advance so well that when the scenario suggested we fall back to the Hornet's Nest, I didn't feel the need. I was holding the line. My men were tired but the secesh were too, and they were taking many more casualties than me. I ignored the game telling me to pull back. After all I hadn't even lost the first few objectives. I was still holding them. Why would I pull my lines back?

At the very end of the scenario ONE FREAKING CONFEDERATE CAVALRY UNIT managed to squeeze past my lines and capture Pittsburg Landing. This led to me to ultimately lose the battle, because in the game's eyes I didn't control the most important objective. On no planet whatsoever would one cavalry unit of 300 men completely cut off an army of that size. By every measurable metric I had one that battle. But because I didn't play the way the game wanted me to and take the carefully choreographed historical steps it wanted me to I lost. The game literally wanted me to make the same mistakes the Union made. Let me re-fight the Battle of Shiloh and win the damn thing. 

I realize that The Battle of Shiloh was a fighting retreat for the Union. I have no problem with games recreating actual historical battles and giving you historical situations to see how you would handle them. But there was no need for me to actually engage in a fighting retreat! I had won! I had mounted a successful defense! 

I'm sad to say it sort of ruined the rest of the game for me. I'm not sure why the developers decided to make the campaign missions quite as scripted as they are. They have a solid battle engine and really fantastic AI. They could have made the campaign battles much less scripted and more sandbox style and this game would have been a masterpiece.

I give the game 6/10 stars. It does a lot of things right. But let me be an actual Civil War general. Not just a puppet going through the same historical dance moves that the real life generals did.",1658086315,1658086315,True,28,1,0.67955470085144043,2,True,False,False

THE GOOD
- Campaign battles scale well. You start with smaller groups of units and maps. The game progressively builds up complexity as you advance through the campaign. 
- Tactics and coordination. Either coordinate your attacks or suffer the consequences. Getting flanked is brutal. Use your skirmishers and charge artillery if close. Pause the game. Play the tactics game or suffer the consequences. 
- The way you control your units is intuitive. Moving and positioning your units is a huge part of this game. Pay attention to terrain and use the ""Double Time"" command to make sure you move units quickly. Timing is everything and units move more slowly through wooded areas than roads or open fields- this makes all the difference in flanking the enemy or being flanked. 
- Pay attention to your supply lines and each unit's details. Units that run out of ammo will not retreat (they will shout for ""Ammo!"", and instead will take casualties. Establish supply lines and protect them. Keeping a tab on whether your unit's captain is down, morale is low or condition is low is something you must do to be successful, especially once the enemies start using cover and trenches. 

THE BAD
- The historical accuracy leaves a lot to be desired. if you aren't familiar with the Civil War, or are just here for a light theme, this won't be a problem for you. The battles you've heard of will appear (Gettsyburg, 1st/2nd Bull Run , Antietam) BUT If you are more than a casual historian you'll start to notice the details are off. Where reinforcements arrive from, how objectives shift across the map, the overwhelming number of enemy units that continue to appear regardless of how many casualties you inflict. 
- The campaign is too scripted. Even if you win every single battle you'll still end up fighting through 1865. This is where the replay value breaks down unfortunately. It's fun the first time, although it doesn't provide the entertaining ""what if"" scenarios you would assume you are influencing. 
- Cavalry units don't need to be used at all to beat the game. This is unfortunate. You've got one of the game's units (1 of your 4 options) that are unnecessary to use- this feels like a design oversight. Artillery and Infantry are enough to beat the game, and often will give you more utility than Cavalry since being coordinated and keeping your army together is the best way to avoid a tragedy. 
- AI charges are devastating, which is unrealistic and frustrating. They'll have more success than the user with this mechanic. To counter this, every time you hear the ""charge"" trumpet pause the battle, find out which of your units is getting charged and fallback (if possible). Charges weren't used much in the civil war because they were wildly unsuccessful given how devastating the weapons were from a range. Spare me your Little Round Top story here as well- charges were rare, but they are constant in this game. 
- Some battles have entire parts that are inconsequential to the outcome. For example, Chickamauga's start for the Union is entirely historical units (cool, right!). However, regardless of whether you tell these troops to retreat, march them straight into the enemy, or try to hold the line it doesn't have any bearing on the outcome of the battle. Your own army troops show up and are next to the objective to keep the battle going. This all creates a question- why are the devs including entire gameplay segments that are fillers? 

OVERALL
Do you like tactical games? How about constantly pausing the game, micromanaging units and adapting your strategy? If the answer is ""yes"", than this is for you. History buffs won't be blown away, especially the longer you play, but it's a solid strategy game that does what it does well- tactical battles. Don't expect anything ground breaking from the campaign or army management and you'll be satisfied. I thoroughly enjoyed this game- no regrets in my time investment, but given the lack of depth in the campaign and the inconsequential battle segments I can't justify pouring more time into this. I experienced a good game and leave with nothing left to gain on this battlefield.",1657418975,1657418975,True,1,0,0.50397336483001709,0,True,False,False

gamer since 75, got my first 2600 in 77.  Imo if men of war made a game like this or game labs made a game like men of war, it would be one of the best of all time. Not sure how big their company is but if they like millions of bucks I would say start on the ww2 path. thousands of ww2 games only a few dozen that are good. Total War does not take the whole RTS market!

 The pace and building your army as u go and managing resources and men with saving when ever u want. the maps and length of battles and length of game feels worth the price on sale or not. Its not frantic, would like one more click of zoom but it is just the right pace for me. Reminds me of Close Combat but much better. 

If you like rts or civil or any type of war game I can not find any reason not to buy this game. I come back to it over and over. 500 plus hours and it is still challenging to me. Soo many games I buy make me feel like I paid too much. Not this game. Oh yeah, I wait years for aaa titles to come down in price. Black ops three was on sale for 19 and I thought that was too much. I got this game when it was new and if it broke somehow I would pay again. Not sure how long I will have to wait for total war ..hammer 3 to drop to 29 lol. 

Get this game.

Ps: this is not a graphic beats, the t&l wont make you feel like your on the field, but I dont think there is any other game that makes me feel as invested as I am in my squads or divisions or armies like this game does!

I was reading some of the neg. reviews, I have a mid level pc and my old 2 core with gt450 played the game just fine, the AI changes every time I replay, how you deploy and the number of men and upgrades change the battle every time. Conversely it is a historical game and there is some consistency to the AI. Play it over with different stat. and you will notice the changes.

Sorry to go on but the neg. reviews get to me. This game is like chess imo. Every little tiny thing you do when in building mode affects your strategy options in grand battles, there are a few ways to win a grand battle and many ways to lose. Your very first building mode makes a difference in you end battles! A major part of this game is about stamina for your little guys and patients by you. The thinking part is one of the things that keeps me coming back to this game. You will have to restart many grand battles! I have watched specials on the civil war including just last month an 8 part show. Seems pretty accurate to me in many ways. Not a buff but I think this is a good representation of the real battles and strategy and intricacies involved...and luck. Tutorial...Read the manual which is in full color with pictures even and you will know how to play the game in detail. You do have to read and you will have to restart grand battles. not necessarily a game for kids or jump in for an hour and blow some stuff up with incredible graphics. Not COD by any means, the opposite imo, its for people who go from 25-5 in cod and now go 5-25 k/d imo, even though I would have loved this game at any age, I funny that way, I like to have a few games that make me think rather than react fast or build as fast a a cpu can and spam out armies. You cant just build 50 tanks and spam the AI.

The small skirmish battles where you only command 1-2 corps are fantastic, challenging and packed with fun strategy. 

The large campaign battles are where this game really struggles. The top negative review doesn't make sense unless you've played the game ""How do X amount of troops suddenly go missing?"" The game will randomly decide to redeploy your troops elsewhere, whenever it needs to. I just barely drew the battle of Fredericksburg to a draw in my last battle, and it's because the game decided to spawn only a quarter of my forces elsewhere, and worse yet, it chose to spawn only 2 unit of infantry, and 5 of  cannons... with low ammo, because they were low ammo when I had them fighting earlier, however a supply wagon was on it's way to resupply them, before they respawned on the other side of the map, and the map completely cut them off from the rest of my forces. 

my above example isn't the first time this re-spawn my forces elsewhere thing has happened, it was just the most recent, and the first battle that made me Tie with the enemy rather than my deserved Victory.

The game will pretend that 3 different battles are happening at once, cutting off each section of map to a smaller map, and then decide to join all 3 subsections towards the end. which in infuriating because you never know when its going to happen. When I first looked at the pregame battle map I already had a plan, rush one flank, and then spread while the rest of my army simply holds the damned line. Then I got to the battle portion, and suddenly each portion of my army was cut off from the other two thirds, and unable to rally at the flank I knew I was going to rush. 

So all in all this game is fun, it is challenging, it is good, but I have no idea why the large battles where you can finally bring your full force to bear are so poorly designed,  Clearly the game can handle big battle simulations, why detract from those epic moments by cutting them into smaller battles?",1657066029,1657066029,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]The Game[/h1]

Ultimate General Civil War is an American Civil War RTS battle simulator with campaign mechanics.
-Play as the Union or the CSA
-Campaign, Custom Game or Historical Battle - No Multiplayer in Base Game
-Economy, Manpower and Armament Constraints in Campaign
-Multiple Difficulty Levels
-Major Battles of Civil War plus 48 Smaller Skirmishes which affect the Major Battles in the Campaign (i.e If you win the skirmish of Seven Pines the AI will have a manpower penalty for the major battle of 2nd Manasses)

[b]Pros[/b]
-Absolutely no bugs in the 60 or so hours I have played
-The game looks pretty good for being almost 5 years old
-Managing which units get what resources can be fun (i.e. Which units get the modern(1861) rifles and veteran replacements and which units get the raw recruits)
-You lose enough battles/skirmishes you get fired
-There is a time limit which can force you and the AI to do things that are unexpected

[b]Cons[/b]
-The tutorial is laughable. It is not really a tutorial, it is simply the first skirmish in the campaign, and the game drops you in the deep end. Here are some units, that is the objective... you figure it out. Along the way, you may get one or two messages about how your general has a radius that affects unit morale. 
-No matter what, you always feel unfairly “behind” the AI in the campaign. On normal difficulty as the Union, I beat the AI in every battle and skirmish (except Seven Pines) and I am constantly facing a CSA army that has more troops which are all Vets - For me, the cost of vet troops is simply prohibitaivly expensive. When I play as the CSA the reverse is true. I can only conclude it is a coding decision to shore up a bad AI.
-When you find a leader in the game with your last name, but on the wrong side of your belief





[h2]The Short Review[/h2]
I wanna say this game is an oldie and goodie, but it is a lot more complicated than that. 

In short, the game can be fun, but more often than not the game is frustrating. The frustration is not due to having a great AI and being beat fairly - it is because of decisions the coding team made to give the AI a leg up. One could say the game is cheating. 

I am not a Civil War historian, but I know the US South suffered from equipment and manpower issues throughout the entire war and acted accordingly. Instead of figuring out a way to simulate that in the game the designers simply give the south more manpower, better manpower, and money than the north if you play as the Union. If you play as the CSA it does the same by giving the Union more manpower and money, but that is more realistic so more acceptable - I guess.

With that in mind, the game can be very frustrating at times, but at least for me, I have gotten hours of mostly fun gameplay and will continue to play it while I try to figure out how to get around the unfair advantage the AI has. For that reason, and the limited number of games in this genre I would recommend it. It really is the best of the worst in the genre of American Civil War strategy games(RTS or otherwise).

The AI is retarded. Even when I issue them a Hold command the units will end up turning or chasing in just a way to allow one volley from even 30 skirmishers to flank them. Meanwhile, I can surround an enemy unit on 3 sides with full infantry units and it still takes forever to flank them. Even when I do flank an enemy unit, they retreat behind my lines instead of towards theirs, causing me to have numerous skirmishes across the field to avoid my main line from being flanked by 20-150 troops.

More often than not you can loose an engagement simply because a unit turned itself 5 degrees to the left without your command and got itself flanked. I even had a 2500 strong infantry unit get routed by a tiny skirmisher and a 300 strong infantry force because it barely turned itself. Here I am making beautiful tactical moves, enveloping the entire enemy force, guarding my actual flanks, while the AI routes my units because of tiny 5-10 degree turns it does itself. Completely unrealistic and not really fun. Expect to spend most of your time micro managing tiny adjustments to facing  (which has cumbersome controls btw) and doing your best to force your units to hold those positions. If you need to advance while doing this, good luck.

Then there is the cav with its dumb AI. I had a cav unit hiding in the woods with decent condition and issue the order for it to charge a small distance to an enemy gun placement. Apparently the unit got tired before they made it across a microscopic field and decided to just stand there in the open and get blasted by guns. ""Charge men!! Wait, my horse is tired. Let's stand is this lovely field and have a picnic while the horses graze. We can enjoy the flowers and the sound of our bodies being crushed by cannon balls.""

Original review:
First off, I know the game is a bit older and the price is quite low so I did not expect a lot. I played the battle of Shiloh for about 2 hours as the Union and honestly had a lot of fun. What's not fun is that I nearly routed the entire Confederate forces on day 1 - just to be back behind my lines on day 2. Other reviews that say this game is SCRIPTED are correct, something I was hoping would not be the case.

Yes it was fun for 2 hours. Immediately quit the game on day 2 of the battle after the game erased all my progress.",1656121919,1656398660,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The battles are scripted in a way that takes all strategy and tactics out of the player's hands. I am 40 hours into the Confederate campaign, and have just lost the campaign, due to the battle of Chickamauga.

I deployed my Artillery Corp, consisting of 7 infantry brigades and 80 cannons, to protect my left flank. Only, on the 3rd and final day of battle, after holding all my positions, the Union attacks my left flank, and the game decides I only deployed 2 infantry brigades to defend the left flank, instead of 7. Thus, my cannons are defenseless against 20,000 Union troops. How does it make any sense, when the game doesn't even let you deploy your troops as you like?!

My intention was to deploy my 80 cannons behind my 15,000 infantry, yet the game put 12,000 of them on my right flank, even though I specifically assigned that Corp to the left flank. Not only that, but the left flank is its own battle map, so it won't even let me move my troops up to defend it, even though the Union gets a bunch of unfair troop spawns. I would give this game 10/10, if not for this fact. Instead, it gets a 6/10.

But the Scaling of armies in this game, the biggest let down. It's atrocious and for that reason alone, DO NOT Each new battle phase has to be fought with similar historic numbers, so if you lose badly or win by annihilating the opposing army, each new battle you are numerically set back to square one. 

Scaling makes the game almost unplayable - DON'T BUY!

Yes, you will have some 'white stars' grading units as superior, you'll get better weaponry. But, it is a bit like 'Ground hog day', you start each new battle pretty much as is and was, pointless from a strategic point of view. Scaling essentially takes this game to ruin.

Now, the American Civil War is a period in history both romantic and brutal. The in battle mechanics are okay; it can be difficult to keep track of your units and you will randomly forgot about this or that 1,000 men here and there, such is the fog of war, I'm okay with that. But, one aspect I am not okay with, is phantom units at the rear.

So you will 'rout' an enemy unit, they'll disperse in horror, sometimes they'll run right past your lines. You can't pursue them, they just flee in terror and 'good riddance' you think. Your army is in position.

The enemy is dumbfounded, they've been put to 'rout' and they politely skip past your lines and you can't stop them! So, what to do, well you fight on, being a super wizard general, then suddenly...your cannons and baggage trains will come under attack at the REAR! 

You guessed it, the unit you smashed earlier, those men that your own army just let run right past and through them, the enemy unit you couldn't stop from screaming past your lines. Well, they've only re-organised, had a chat and decided rather cunningly to attack you from the rear. 

So the best tactic in this game, is to have ALL YOUR men scream 'surrender' and crash to 'rout' they'll be allowed to walk unmolested through the enemy lines. Then at some later point you can simply magically re-organise your men and attack the unsuspecting enemy from the rear - absolute rubbish game, makes no sense and did I mention the scaling is atrocious.",1570181923,1654104246,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, if you want a game that treats you fairly against the AI while still providing an adequate challenge, you're not going to find that here. Calvary runs as fast as most infantry units, and supply wagons seem to not be drawn by horses but propelled by rockets. Generally, unless you consistently wipe out the entire AI every major engagement you are either going to be outnumbered or outgunned. This is fine sometimes however when playing defense (here is looking at you CSA in Fredricksburg and Antietam) your majestic army will be wiped out not because the enemy is better, or uses better tactics, but because of killing 2:1 still isn't enough.So even if you win the battle, it becomes Pyrrhic. The reason I finally set it down was because of Shiloh. Oh Shiloh you buggy little mess. I won the first day decisively, cutting the enemy's forces in two and using howitzer and carbine calvary to contain breakouts.Estimated 70% losses on the Union side, and the capture of Pittsburg landing with 50 Minutes to spare. Did the game do what it was supposed to and declare victory like other multi-day battles do after you complete all objectives? Oh no. It not only resets me and allowed the scattered and destroyed Union army to walk back to their fortifications, but granted the scripted 25K reinforcements for the Union despite my capture of the landing that would have made it possible!

[SMG!]), improving in some aspects while regressing in others. I’ve played through both campaigns multiple times on Brigadier-General and Major-General and despite the scenario repetitiveness, I always learn new tricks that keep combat and army management interesting. I’d love a sequel that addresses the game’s shortcomings. 

Pros: Fun, easy to learn while difficult to master, pleasant maps, and, most of all, organizing your army is very addictive. 

Cons: The AI is unimaginative and difficulty is increased by AI cheating and player penalizing. The campaign is very linear and once you learn the scenarios, there are lots of cheap hacks. There are numerous mechanic problems that coalesce to make winning battles more about accruing ridiculous KDA ratios than using Civil War tactics and strategy.

Recommendations for an Ultimate General: Civil War II

1) Units recover fighting capacity way too quickly. The morale penalty for high casualties is welcome but insufficient. Since the AI doesn’t care about taking ninety percent casualties, this leads to tedious attrition firefights. 

You can inflict over twenty-five damage on an AI brigade only to face it on the to the frontlines within a few minutes. Since replacing your own losses is costly, you can wipe out ninety percent of the enemy army and win with a 5:1 casualty ratio yet be unable to replace your losses. A much slower recovery rate would also challenge players to manage brigades more carefully. In short battles, you might only get one engagement out of a green unit. 

2) An “effective strength” metric (like CWG2 had) would alleviate this problem. As units maneuver and fight, soldiers flee and formations get tangled. Effective strength would be dependent on morale, condition, and a new sliding scale—organization (another metric from CWG2). 

3) A clumping penalty. The AI loves clumping (I’ve never played a Civil War video game where the AI didn’t). First, impose organization/efficiency penalties that lower effective strength. Second, the “blocking” mechanic needs to be more stringently implemented. It’s way too easy to have your units in a tangle all somehow firing at the same enemy while exhibiting remarkable firing vectors. 

4) Replace the “unit breaking” mechanic with routing, like CWG2 and SMG! Routed units take extra casualties, are more likely to surrender, and will flee off the field if not rallied but are not removed from your army in a campaign. 

5) Movement/UI/Unit Commands
Add a “use roads” command to have units prioritize road pathing, a “stay in column/limbered'' command, and 
division formation commands. 

6) Infantry
Program the AI to detach/reattach skirmishers. Detaching skirmishers is one of the game’s strongest mechanics but the AI doesn’t use it and instead gets bonus skirmishers (the generically labeled skirmishers aren’t from historical orders of battle). 

7) Artillery
a) Add a line of fire for topography and terrain. It’s currently a cheap and effective tactic to clump tons of artillery behind your infantry. It would be more rewarding to utilize lines of fire to deploy and counter artillery.  
Note: I’m okay with artillery being able to fire through units. Since the game is brigade level, there’s a degree of abstraction as each brigade has four to six regiments spaced out in battle lines. 

b) Increase artillery range to historical effective ranges. 

c) Long range artillery fire (even if negligible damage) should disrupt a unit’s organization, leading to decreased effective strength (a mechanic present but a bit overpowered in CWG2). 

d) Make counter-battery fire more effective. First, add a command for artillery to focus other artillery. Second, artillery needs to incur heavier penalties from incoming artillery fire. As is, the AI will keep artillery units on the firing line until they’re destroyed. Historically, accurate counter-battery fire could force a battery to withdraw due to damage to guns, caissons, horses, ect. 

e) Make artillery units partially visible when firing. Blackpowder cannons give away their position from firing and even if enemy artillery can’t directly see the guns, they can return fire. 

f) Add horse artillery, siege guns, and siege mortars either as new units or artillery variants (like CWG2 had). 

8) Skirmishers
Refine the skirmish “running back and forth while fighting”automation; it creates more micro-management problems than it solves. This also applies to detached skirmishers, dismounted cavalry, and especially mounted cavalry. 

9) Cavalry
Cavalry is a mess. Granted, I’ve never played a Civil War video game that does cavalry justice. AI and allied cavalry are frequently represented as skirmishers or infantry because of the inherent flaws in cavalry mechanics (ex: Wilder’s Lightning Brigade and Forrest’s cavalry corps at Chickamauga). 

a) Eliminate the 750-man size limit, refine the maneuvering, efficiency, and firing mechanics, and decrease cavalry cost (possibly adding a horse resource pool that’d also be used for artillery and supplies). As currently designed, a large cavalry brigade is unwieldy if not inoperable. That’s a huge part of the problem. I typically run 4-5 brigades of 400-500 troopers. By comparison, the Army of the Potomac’s cavalry corps at Gettysburg was over 10,000 men divided into seven brigades. 

b) Get rid of saber cavalry and create slots for primary and secondary weapons. European-style heavy cavalry wasn’t a thing in the Civil War. Troopers typically carried a carbine, multiple pistols, and a saber (if available).

c) Add an infantry battle line formation with talent skills to specialize between mounted, dismounted skirmishers, and dismounted infantry. When dismounted, cavalry lose ¼ of their effective strength, as those folks tend to the horses. 

10) Corps Commanders
Add a “rally” command (like SMG!) to use on routed brigades.

11) Fortifications
a) The fortification mechanics need a complete overhaul. Many are death traps, and they wreak havoc on firing arcs, flanks, and perceived visual location. Lastly, the AI is obsessed with manning some of them. While most aspects of the game work (just not always in a historically fun way), these often don’t.

b) Add a “dig in” mechanic (again like CWG2 and SMG!) as a toggle on/off command where brigades automatically entrench if stationary and unengaged. There can be two levels of entrenchment: level one provides modest protection and is destroyed when the unit moves (with some leeway for wheeling) and level two gives substantial protection and becomes a permanent map fixture (like the Cold Harbor breastworks). 

c) Add a skill statistic for entrenching. Increased skill level decreases entrenching time, increasing the protection provided, and decreases condition lost. 

13) Officers/Generals
This aspect is frankly a bit lazy and one of the worst aspects of the game. 

a) Create multi-dimensional leader statistics. Instead of one trait (command that only affects efficiency), have multiple traits (like CWG2) that affect a variety of unit stats (example: charisma increases morale and melee). These traits increase (or decrease) based on the unit’s performance. 

b) Eliminate the rank-based experience and make ranks work like actual ranks (i.e. officers hold a rank commensurate with their command regardless of competency). Officers still get promoted based on tenure, but it’s not always correlated to skill level, and there’s no major-generals commanding 200-man skirmish battalions. 

c) Bad generals can’t be demoted but can be relieved at a reputation cost.

You are restraint by time restriction + unbalanced ai and it is unbalanced reinforcements. Even in the first mission enemy skirmishers will have double the range of your infantry including your skirmishers.

Looks beatiful overall but turns into a frustration quickly. How well you play sometimes does not matter, your 600 man squad will be sniped by 200 man skirmishers, your 600 hundred will inflict few hits while those skirmishers will kill 30-40 with single volley., this is not by ambush. 200 man will stand infront of your 600 man, exchange volleys and they will win.

So as usual it is GAMELABS tradition, put something looking nice, put lots of nice stuff in it, and somehow manage to turn it into ultimate frustration. Well done. 

------------------------------------
INITIAL REVIEW

It is graphicaly 2D sprites style but still pleasant looking game, only ground texture detail could be a little higher.

Generaly a very good game. Only problem is for me, an usual UG and UA common problem, maintaining your army for future battles, because the enemy ai will throw lots of stuff at you in the advancing missions. You have army of 25k soldiers, enemy will attack you with 45k soldiers, and the game becomes very difficult and may be you will be stuck.

So the campaign screen is where you should be good at, not the real battle :) Managing your army, you can create army of veterans with best rifles, this way you will be limited in numbers and fail. I have not tried other apprach but I am sure it will succeed, which is thousands of meat shields approach, overwhelming the enemy with quantity instead of quality. 

So negative thing is scripting of the campaing and increasing difficulty, you need an advisor reminding you to recruit more or guide you. For example telling you ""General we need to have at least 30k troops in our advancing battles / we need more artilery etc., recon estimates enemy numbers to be around 40k"". This is valid for all UA/UG games, same with ultimate admiral when you are happy with your 5th rate frigates and suddenly you face SOLs in your next mission, and you do not have funds to buy bigger ships (may be there is no big ship in store) to counter the enemy.

So this small tiny problems just makes Game-Labs strategy games to be just above average-good instead of being good-great games. Wish they were correcting these problems, but they kind of move on.

Overal this game still gets an 8/10 from me, worth investing and playing if you like the historical setting and you are very patient. So accept these problems and adjust your gameplay, you will enjoy for sure.",1642948179,1651506455,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, your ability to win a battle with only two control points balances it out.

The campaigns and battles are very interesting and the AI is excellent. I like the realistic weapons modelling, and the way battles play out very much, you can really feel a sense of urgency and emotion with each confrontation.  
.
What's special about this game, is the ways you build your army up : using the resources at hand, purchasing the right type of rifles and cannon, appointing the right leaders, developing your veteran units, then assigning your brigades into the right corps and divisions, then replenish your units after a hard fought battle.. The flexibility in organising your force is immense, and in itself makes for a different playthrough each and every time. It is the feature I like the most.   
.
Having said that, the one thing that put players off is the linear campaign, and the fact that all battles are on rails. Given -this makes for excellent historic play, and I guess that different army builds and force layouts might shake things up a bit in each playthrough. However, the fact remains that once you know the way each battle develops - after several playthroughs - it feels like being able to see the future, and you can easily beat the game at any difficulty. You know what forces you will face, where charges will come from, where to defend fiercely, and where you can even avoid battle in order to place your force in a better position to rush an objective. It is at that point the game loses a lot of its punch, and leaves a tiny bit of a bitter aftertaste.  
.
I can imagine that if the developers ever decided to work on an open campaign map (even a hex style, wouldn't have to be Total War), further developed the economy and political system,  and therefore encouraged some sort of randomization in each battle, this could become one of the best wargaming platforms ever.

It can take an inordinate amount of time to get things set up and it would be nice if there was a way to set division templates or group-manage units.

One of the best Civil War games to come along in quite some time. Right up there with Civil War Generals 2 and Sid Meyer's Gettysburg. Great campaign game with the decisions you have to make between battles and some RPG elements as you decide how to level up yourself and your officers in about a half dozen categories. You start as a division commander in either the Union or Confederate army and work your way up.
       The battles are real time as in Sid Meyer's Game but with the campaign option added as in Civil War Generals 2. The game isn't perfect but in my opinion the few flaws are minor and hardly worth mentioning, so I won't. The game as of this writing is in early access and seems to have great support by the developers. Should see the few flaws ironed out and more content added as the patches keep coming pryor to full release in about a month. The game is certainly in a very playable state right now though anyways. As a Civil War History buff I really do appreciate this game and want to thank the developers for a great pre-release. I would give it an 8 out of 10 as is and should be at least a 9 by final release. For now it's back to my armies campaign and more challenging, fun battles!
       The following added 4 years later (Update) -  For some reason I've played more hours than what is shown. Overtime the game has come into full release, has been updated and has gotten even better. Game labs has done a great job! I now give it a 9 out of 10.

I'd give the game a 6.3 our of 10 at this point, mostly because it's okay, but far from perfect. Play conservatively on the hardest setting and you will still win 94(?)% of the time, if not always, once you understand unit behaviors and reactions better. That easy to beat on a hard setting is not good, but I will admit over 30 hours of play will refine your skills for Big Picture Strats, as well. I love the graphics and pace, which you can make faster if desired, but the following are the game's downfalls:

1) The landmarks not being named is just laziness and a time waster. 2) Multi-day historical scenarios should not be interrupted and reset to predetermined points, but rather should be allowed as a continuous scenario. Getting set back when you've amassed great gains is annoying and developers should have adjusted slightly for this or left it alone per my suggestion.  3) The Fallback order is messed up and shows troops reversing direction when in fact it should be more of a controlled backwards, shooting walk facing the enemy. Getting flanked is detrimental; you back to the enemy is unit suicide. 4) Many scenarios depict positional defenses when all that was there or required was the actual busy terrain per the actual battle. Too many of the battles incorporate dug in defenses, whereas battlefield positing is more interesting and what being a general is about. 5) Still don't dig the micro management of budgeting and outfitting units in the Campaign mode. Enough micro management is put into this rather slow and thoughtful form of combat to begin with. 

Upsides? - A great substitute in lieu of a better game for the genre. Nice graphics. One can pause for setting unit orders. Multiple play speeds (bet be a master on higher settings, although playing a few fast... think speed chess... may reveal a few fundamentals faster.. or hide them... IDK) One can create a skirmisher unit from any brigade, and (too) small units may be combined with others, as well.

End Point: In defensive scenarios, such as Gaines' Mill and Malvern Hill, there will be a time limit to which you must hold a position, often before you are told to defend the next backward position. It is very suspect that the PC player makes it's hard move just as this time limit approaches. There you are, holding against great odds for 2 hours, and i the last minute you are overcome. This is fine for historical accuracy, I suppose, but what it means is the AI is leading you on to achieve that timely simulation moment. You are not getting by your hard fought tenacity, but rather the AI holding back. It takes the wind out of my sails for the game, and means the AI may be programmed to behave this way even for scenarios with no clutch points accept the end (lone time limit as oppose to multiple planned resets within the same scenario). That said, if the game is worth playing at all, it is in the single time limit scenarios... you get the idea, but once I noticed the AI defeat when it had to for historical accuracy, or the entire scenario resets all surviving units to next-step positions, it was less fun than my rating. Therefore, as of now, I'm done with the game. This alone makes Sid Meier's Gettyburg (supposedly abandonware, now) a superior game, from 1996.

However the campaign mechanics are abysmal. You often have options to place multiple armies at multiple ""engagements"" of a multi-part battle, but there's absolutely zero information on whether your other armies are going to be included when you fight that phase of the battle. Sometimes they are! Sometimes they aren't! How am I supposed to know?

You also randomly get borrowed units from other armies that don't level up alongside your units, but there's never any indication on when this is, or why.

Playing a flawless campaign of the North, I won literally every battle up until Gettysburg. The first day, I won with ease, with my main army. Assuming my main army would be included with my secondary army, because that's how the campaign battles have worked up until now, I made my secondary army small as a kind of reinforcements. Nope. suddenly in this phase of the battle, even though it's literally played on the exact same map, my first day army is vanished and only my secondary army is on the field. Naturally I was up against 20 divisions with 2, and had to hold 4 points, and lost.

Supporting the confederacy is not a legitimate opinion, of course people have a right to freedom of speech, but it has limits when the speech threatens or implicates harm to other people - which advocating for slavery most certainly is. The more common route of the assortment of idiots and white s*premacists, the ""states rights"" argument or any take that denies slavery as a primary cause of the war is *harmful* misinformation (cause it covers and aides the afore mentioned n*zis), thereby also qualifying to be removed by mods. As they have facilitated the community, the devs have a responsibility to crack down on pro-slavery takes within it, which so far as I'm aware they have not. This isn't debatable, the only folks who would dispute any of this are those who have some sympathy to the slave owners. Do better (please) devs. I get that you are probably a small team that may lack the ability to moderate all their forums, but if you even implemented small things, like a pinned post or a section in the menu or at the start of the game about any confederate takes being unwanted and disgusting, then at least you are not simply ignoring the reality of your community.

So far I have clocked in just over 25 hours. I am addicted and here's why.

1. The game is hand drawn, down to the figures and portraits. making the game experience not only INSANELY pretty but also completely new for any strategy game that I have ever played.

2.The maps are 100% Accurate, again also hand drawn, they are accurate maps of the battlefields that these battles were fought on + some surrounding areas. Making it so that you're not confined to repeat the battle tactics of the time, it gives you the freedom to be your own tactician.

3. The Audio is superb, I could listen to musket volleys and cannon fire all day. In addition you can also hear the faint marching and drumbeats of your enemy through the fog of war, giving you an idea of where they might be

4. The Armies are absolutely massive, yet well organized and very easy to control. I just finished the Battle of Fredericksburg with an army of 80,000, and the game is like, ""Yeah but the rebels have 60,000 and are dug in, so maybe take 40,000 more."" And I am like holy shit okay. But the Army is very organized into Corps, divisions, and then your individual brigades that you can control. I really appreciate this structure because it is easy to understand and my ADD doesn't go crazy like it does for other strategy games.

5. I lost 57,849 men at the battle of Fredericksburg, It was not an enjoyable experience. You get an after action report between battles and even between battle phases, You are awarded Manpower and money after each battle, the income of which is decided on whether it was a Defeat, Draw, or victory. However, you also are awarded Political points,or you lose political points if you suffer a defeat. which can be used to purchase generals, equipment, money, or manpower. 
6. Equipment is probably my fav aspect of the game, it gives you like 50 options of various era appropriate rifles, percussion muskets, flintlock muskets, revolver rifles, carbines, cannon, howitzers etc to equip your units with varying degrees of availability. Wanna equip your new brigade with 2500 Henry rifles? Guess what, there are only 4 on the market rn bitch, better stockpile that. Want some Texas carbines? Guess what, you’re the north bitch, better hope your enemy has some that you can capture in battle. AND EVEN if you do have 4000 British produced enfield muskets, do you have enough men to give them to? 

7. The last thing I wanna talk about is the AI and the Time progression. The AI is insanely smart for any strategy game that I have played. Yes, it does get a kick in the pants to help it against a human player, but not enough to make it seem ahistorical or overwhelming. However it is mean. It will attempt to flank you, charge you if it has numbers to do so, It will keep reserves that you will curse. And when the enemy brigades charging you have the names of Jackson, Bragg, Lee and Stuart, you can’t help but worry for your lines.

Lastly, and the biggest thing that I can’t decide if I like or dislike. UGCW is a real time strategy, and I mean REAL time. The dev team went back, checked out how long each combat phase of each battle took, and they gave you that time. For example, Lee took Gaines Mill in 2 hours. Congratulations, you now have 2 hours to take Gaines Mill. and That is the MINIMUM amount of time that they give you. Your 2 hours are up but you are almost there? Sure, finish the fight. Granted there is a speed bar and taking an objective early in an assault mission will end the fight early. (If you survive the AI’s counter attack) 

Overall, I just spent 3 hours watching 57,849 of my men try to take a hill again and again and again, And I was invested in every single second of my crushing defeat. I am a very big fan, If you are a fan of the total war games but they just dont have the right Umph, give this one a try",1641516843,1641516907,True,30,0,0.780014991760253906,0,True,False,False

History - some of the history stuff was cool and since I knew the battlefield layouts it was pretty neat seeing how they translated it into their games visual assets. But there were some heinous errors, oversights, and missed opportunities. The game feels like you're only being shown ""some"" of the battles -- yes gettysburg, no vicksburg. Only maybe a third of the major conflicts are shown (which, tbh because of other issues with the game that I'll address later, probably was for the best. The game would have gotten extremely tedious.)  Final map is ""The battle for Richmond"" which in the civil war was inconsequential, and not the Appamatox campaign where Lee actually surrendered. Seemed like they couldn't find a way to show the Siege of Petersburg either (and wave away in the game text by saying ""We decided we didn't have time for a siege"" - what a distortion of the real story!) and had to do something else.

Gameplay - It's almost hard to say that the game has gameplay. You don't actually do that much, aside from positioning units which is generally unresponsive. By the end game, unit counts are too high to micro and attacks degenerate quickly into selecting large groups of units and having them rush isolated gaps. AI is sketchy at best, especially cavalry. Coding seems lazy and overly simplistic, similar to clash of clans style games rather than a RTS combat sim. Although to be fair, it's not entirely unenjoyable, and kept my attention for a few hours. 

Campaign - by far the worst aspect of the game. Totally lazy design, even though its the games main feature. Each planning round you get a set amount of pre-determined cash and recruits, a set amount of of battles and side missions that you need to do, and a new talent point which gives small flat-rate enhancements to the handful of things the game is tracking (unit replenishment, recruit percentage) or allows spying / larger units. There is no variation from this formula, and the focus on tedium like micromanaging your unit replenishment really drags the pacing of the campaign down.  It really doesn't take much effort to come up with an idea for a totally different way of handling the campaign mode which would have made it much more enjoyable -- replayable seed-generated side missions, a map and choices instead of a list of battles in a set order, a larger variety of maps and battles, avoiding the simplistic focus on ""cash and recruits"" mission rewards and giving a UI which allows the player to make choices that influence the evolution of story and the ability to outfit your team. XCOM's campaign UI isn't even very good but at least they tried -- that's not what this developer did though, c'est la vie.  Very bad, boring, monotonous and lazy.

Replayability - None. Once you play through the campaign, you can play through it the exact same way a second time. There are no meaningful choices that will affect your gameplay experience. Which honestly, is just fine -- since the game wasn't that fun to play, and the campaign mode was tedious and uninspired, I don't even really want to play it again. But you'd think that the developer would care about it, right? They did add in a ""custom game"" where you can select one of the scenarios you already did. But there's no actual ""custom game"" like most other RTS style games, and there's also no ""build breastwork"" gameplay feature, so there would also be no point in a real ""custom game"" because you couldn't ultimately really customize a map full of cool defensive features and then assault it, which you'd expect from an RTS game but somehow this game doesn't need to actually do any of the cool stuff people like, since by the time you figure out that it doesn't, you've already spent the three hours of your steam refund window on the slow and tedious campaign menus to get a refund.

the ability to build your won army to fight the war is great, but i just wish there was a restriction on your army's movement, as sometimes the battles that you fight are insurmountable distances from each other, more specifically, the aspect of having more than one army and you could have multiple different commands in different areas. 

the amount of battles you can fight in the game already is a lot, but i find that there are some that are missing or severely shortened to make space for others, for example, Vickburg and the campaigns in the southern louisiana are missing and the overland campaign battles along with the siege of petersburg are made to seem less important than cold harbor, which in my opinion should not necessarily be considered a major battle as much as it is in the game. this could also tie in to my earlier point on the different commands, because that would allow for you to operate and fight different battles than in the normal game. 

and ending this is the issue that i find with having multiple corps, the costs of creating them tend to have you make them later in the game which starts to hurt you over time as the more corps you make the less experienced they will be, because of how the battles themselves work you want to send your strongest men into the minor battles to make sure that you can win them instead of using them as battles to help train your less battle hardened men.

i'm not going to touch on the many great aspect of the game as that would expand this even more, but despite the issues the game still is a marvel and a testament to how to make a historically accurate game, but one that still allows for the customization and touches that a play could make on the games feel, along with some difficult AI the game is a great mix of accuracy and feel into the time period.",1633833488,1640997558,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You're not going to get realism with RTS, ever, so forget about that, I look for fun and downtime from actual strategic wargaming with these kind of RTS titles, personally, although this game does have some depth, it does not kid itself or you with realism for good gameplay. I also want that genuine Civil War wargaming feel with the aspects unique to that or early industrialised warfare.

This is massed ranks of regiments going at it, toe to toe, across open ground, then charging, breaking, doing it again. This happens. Exhaustion is also a variant and factor, which I approve of and want, because it forces me and the AI to go into the ""Dance of death"" where we have to cycle units into and out of the line, rest, do it all again. Exhausted units, even if superior will break and run against fresh troops. The Dance of Death is a term from that time, it is accurate gameplay.

The terror of seeing huge formations on the other side moving into the line, usually the bluebellies. All of these things I got to see in another old game once, Robert E. Lee: Civil War General by Sierra. It was also a light game but very popular, it had all of those aspects in it, plus you'd lose men to desertion as the battle progressed, that was also very good and true to the time. It was why armies wore bright colours in Europe, not just because it looked nice, but because it would be impossible to ""turn your coat"" inside out and fight for the other side, often under duress.

So it's a shame that UG:Civil war does not have this, but it has everything else to give me what I personally am looking for in RTS US Civil Wargaming.

There is also a nice aspect between the battles of raising and equipping, refreshing your regiments that is quite fleshed out and gives you a sense of investment in the game and campaign. All the names and regiments are accurate after watching through my civil war documentaries and watching videos about the battles again.

There is also supply, which I personally like. I am not balancing well enough between re-manning and raising new regiments with chunking out my supply wagons enough with hard cash. My cannon keep running out about a Third into the battle and about Three Quarters we get low on musket-balls, I rely too much on capturing enemy supply wagons with my cavalry, but really should balance unit formation and resupply with adequate supply funds between the battles, and this is also good, tough but fair, giving a sense of realism.

This is again a good sign of a game for me personally, when it makes me look back through my own resources and references about these battles with renewed interest, like with Shiloh after fighting through it the first time last night and seeing what a bloody battle so early on it was. Sometimes you just sit there, paralysed and aghast watching the shambles play out across the map. Which sadly happened in real life, but today is a new day and I know to pull straight back to Pittsburgh Landing now, unlike the Union generals at the time.

The other thing is that wargaming these battles properly goes against my personal playstyle, but in this case I don't mind. I do mind when it's the devs making play like how they want me to, but this is also accurate to the the time (so it's not devs being lazy, as can happen in other games). When I went up to Fort Sumter, I knew I had to rush it, storm it. I don't like that, I am very loss conscious and love economy of force, it's more satisfying. But I know this era and style and it worked better to storm it messily.

Every time I try to play my style, be really slow, take hours, lose tens of men only a time while annihilating the enemy, usually indirectly or from good cover just is not the mode here, that is how you lose battles. You have to push the enemy relentlessly, just keep throwing more men and materiel in there, because he's dong the same and it's desperate stuff.

So I bought this game on not much discount and despite some bad reviews because I wanted something like the Sierra Game, or Sid Meyer's Gettysburg, Ultimate General: Civil War for me personally delivers that ""pick up and play"" wargaming action I look for when not poring over hex maps doing painstaking moves with more serious turn based games.

The maps look really nice with again the sort of ""arcadey"" look like in those older titles or in Sudden Strike, which again, I'm personally looking for and appreciate in this kind of experience.

I can understand why it might not be some people's cup of tea, but for me and given that I get a full game and campaign with force-building and supply aspects makes it more game and the full game in one price instead of all those dlc like Sudden Strike's strategy, and your troops in that don't even get experience, like in Ultimate General: Civil War. So there is also the Human Resources aspect also to the game, where, apart from the men getting more experienced, it's also good to hire and fire competent and officers to lead your units, as well as use any political influence points you might garner to get named famous officers assigned to your officer pool, or get more troops, money via those political points (you also get to improve yourself, which buffs your army stats, like improvements to your officers do).

All in all a pretty good offer from these devs, but again from my point of view. I had it wishlisted for about a year while I thought about it, because of the price and the fact that it was nearly never on sale, plus some of the negative reviews, also the sort of gamers that were reviewing it on Youtube. They were not really gamers like me and more the sort of ""play it by the numbers"" instant gratification gamers who never have any real understanding of the era or gameplay, even the expert ones.

But in the end I'm personally glad I took the plunge for those reasons.

The older games I mentioned, I've personally enjoyed, but I can't, won't play them again. I'd want at least a similar experience again for my money, plus some more bits and this game does that while still being fairly original in combining and compiling those with being up to date.

The reason everyone says it gets harder after Gettysburg for the Confederates is because Chickamauga is a hard battle regardless of tactics involved, and the rest of the major battles are when the Civil War had become more reminiscent of World War I. The tactics of simply outflanking the enemy becomes much harder when they are massed together on a fortified hill with lots of cannons. And as the Confederates you're going to be attacking 80% of the time. So, even on the easiest difficulty, you have to destroy enemy armies as much as possible in the earlier stages of the campaign.

FINALLY after so many many many years, you have here a very tactical, but very accessible game for anyone interested in The American Civil War and all the battles/skirmishes that happened during that war. 

This game runs very well, is easy to understand, the learning curve is not huge, and the more you advance your tech tree for your army, the more intense and awesome it gets. I really do enjoy how you can create your army and be more artillery or more infantry or heck go nuts and have a whole division of Calvary! It is whatever strategies you want to implement. 

This game so far (as of 11-25-16) gives you the battles from your first skirmishes all the way to Antietam. The rest of the war will be added in the next 2-3 months from now. Look forward to it!

Controlling your units, directing them into line position, and setting up fields of fire are all simple and work very well.  The campaign has you in charge of either the north or south, managing squads, leaders, weapons, and finances.  Beyond the regular campaign, you can setup scenarios as well as adjust some combat/battle options to create your own battles.

The Bad: In the beginning, I was having a lot of fun playing through the campaign.  But at some point, it felt like the difficulty spiked.  After reading information about the game, it turns out that the opponent’s army size scales so that it always has higher troop levels than yours.  This made it so it didn’t matter what decisions I made organizing my army, the enemy would always overwhelm me.  After having this happen and most of my army getting wiped, time after time, I decided to move on.  It also seems there are still several features missing and bugs left that require mods for the issues to be addressed.

Overall:  I would only recommend this game to someone who really likes the civil war.  It contains lots of detail and does a pretty good job simulating the battles.  Anyone else just looking for a new RTS might wait till this one goes on sale.",1638154420,1638154420,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am currently playing on the easiest setting, and the A.I. has very nearly, many times, routed my armies (with ease). I have sat here and watched as the computer player forms it's own front line, performs complex flanking maneuvers, prepares for assaults, effectively coordinates its own units.

I like the whole buying gear from the armory and outfitting your army personally, the reinforcement series, and the intercepted enemy messages between the fights. I'm a sucker for that kind of micromanagement and flavor in a game.

Caution - don't get too attached to any particular units or leaders. It can be heartbreaking to see a pet division you've raised up from nothing and equipped with the best gear get melted under a withering salvo of canon and musket fire while you're on approach to a defended enemy fort.

Your officers aren't safe. Your supplies aren't safe. Keep your canons back from the main line with units defending them (from what I can tell, friendly fire isn't a thing). It's a good game!

Too bad, suddenly your guys are somewhere else, the enemy has shuffled stronger units around so that the ones that were in front of you ten second ago are gone and a horde of fresh troops has appeared out of the blue. Oh and morale? I've never seen a game where a group of 200 men (mauled down from over 2000) will charge 1500 soldiers on high ground.

Honestly a hidden gem of a game. I just finished my first full campaign after many restarts and retries as the union and have to highly recommend this game. I'm personally a fan of the kind of challenge type missions spanning real battles of the time this game has to offer. The games artwork is beautifully done, the audio is amazing, the game play is pretty solid and the fact your generals and officers gain experience over the course of the war and the fact you have full customizeable control over your army that you use throughout the war is a great addition.

It does have its draw backs though that may be off putting to some. Most missions are timed, some being unclear as to how said mission times work. Which to me was kind of frustrating. A lot of the battles can feel scripted, meaning they feel like the game pushes you to place units in specific places and do specific things with those units rather than full strategical freedom. There are some missions where your forces will be split up and the game wont tell you before hand. So you'll have to reload from the start just to find out how to get a good split of units. And one thing i thought that was terribly annoying is the fact that your units will always auto fire at the closest enemy line or unit. So if you have a line of infantry you want shooting at some guys in the east, but also have dudes north that are closer to your dudes, your dudes will auto turn to face the guys north instead giving the enemies in the east flanking shots on your guys. Not sure why this was decided to be a thing in the game. I wish it wasn't as i've accidentally lost plenty of good men at very inopportune times to this function.

Other than that even with its shortcomings the game in my opinion has more positives and is just a fun time. You'll get oodles and oodles of hours playing this game. Even if you beat both campaigns you'll probably just want to do them over again to try new strategies. And even if you one and done both sides you'll still get your monies worth and you'll enjoy every minute of it. Had to leave a good word for this game.

Lots of pros about the game including the depth of strategy and forethought going into battle. The only issue I would gripe about is what they call scaling. The opposing armies are given extra men to help their fight. The problem I see is its arbitrarily decided without any historical forethought. Kind of like a boss level approach to FPS shooter games. Making something hard for the sake of making something hard, to me, isn't fun. Because where's the realism? So Ultimate General is like a casual game to me where it stays on the shelf for a long time till I forget how much it cheats and then I play it again until I run into the cheating. I do recommend this game with caveat it'll sit on the shelf most of the time just because no one likes a cheater.

There have been battles where I felt every loss and where the numbers of men that have been killed or wounded makes you shudder to think about the heavy price of life that was seen on both sides of the conflict back then, the BIG battles especially really capture a bit of what a day or days of battle may have felt like.

Sometimes the battles can be frustrating and very hard to manage, other times you are angry with the A.I. Generals who are basically forcing you to sacrifice your men and units in order to achieve victory.

Balancing out the money, weapons and manpower while trying to ensure that your units are supplied well also gives you a taste of how much of a nightmare logistics might have been back in the 1800's.

It's not a perfect game and there are times where you feel that the numbers of men being sent by the opposing army seem a bit ridiculous, but overall I have had a blast creating my armies, customizing the unit names and finding the best unit set up that works for each situation.

Main critique points:
- bad AI
- no unit formation control
- Menu-UI is convoluted, some things unnecessary, important things not prominent enough...
- translation into german was probably done with google translator
- different difficulties give you a numeric handicap, do not (really) change the AI's behaviour. 

Audio: 
- bad soldier voices when reporting in (sounds like 64kbits mp3 quality)
- recycled soundscapes in camp menu which cycle through and through. (why not use the music of the main menu?)

The game gives you the illusion of a challenge. You got some things to choose from - like perks, army composition, weapons with different ranges and firerates. Skilling units with experience. But in the end it never really mattered. 
I expected it to scale and get harder and scale up with time - but it does not. 

I played US Campain on normal difficulty for like 20 Matches I didnt loose one of them. I wouldnt consider myself to be an RTS-God, sometimes I had to reload and think, but after you figured it out the game is far too easy. All I did was trying to have more than 110% of the enemies corp size (men) and I used every weapon I got dropped. And I won. Easily. Altering the difficulty gives you a massive handicap on the other hand, making winning almost impossible. I just did the first intro-mission and my forces got absolutely crushed - there was absolutely nothing I could do about it. But the AI didn't behave differently. It just had the numbers and the effectiveness.

The praised A.I. of the trailers does nothing really great. It reacts if you misplaced your units - punishes you for your mistakes, yes. But it is not pro-active. It does not force you to make mistakes - maybe only in scripted events. 
The last game I won was ""hold position x - wait"". I hid in the woods near the mission point, pushed enemies away and stood there. For three in-game hours. They charged me several times, promts appearing calling ""confederate units are approaching from the west!"" - but after the AI didnt find a way to get around me, it just did nothing. The units tried to stay out of range and that's it. When they charge, they immediatly stop if you deploy skirmishers from the infantry unit making two units out of one. 
It also suffers from more major flaws but explaning them all here would overload this comment. 


Conclusion: 
The game looks unfinished. A bit like nobody did an play-test. There is much potential for telling stories of the american civil war which had been spared. That is totally ok for a small studio. But there is so much more what this game could be and is not. Just Imagine what Multiplayer support would change. The AI wouldnt be a thing anyone would talk about anymore.",1631499526,1631499526,False,21,2,0.585532903671264648,4,True,False,False

If you enjoyed the Total War series, the unit control and multi-unit battles are very similar...morale plays an important role in a units ability to fight. But, comparing this to Shogun: Total War, there are more options and buffs/debuffs available on the battlefield due to the various historic weapons. You can choose to stay in cover and fire volley after volley, if you have adequate supply nearby. You can run up on the enemy and then charge, which can rout that unit entirely. But you can only charge for a short time before the men are exhausted. In between battles, you can manage the army structure and weapon loadouts. For example, buying the rifles with a longer effective range can give you the edge in a shootout against a tenacious foe while you are both in cover...but would it be more effective to use that money to raise new regiments of rookies who can charge the enemy? You can also choose to specialize a unit for endurance and speed, or fire accuracy, or for reloading rates. The opportunities for tactics are endless.  Your officers level up and gain perks that benefit all troops under their command. You can hire new officers from the academy. You can also spend your reputation points (earned by victories on the battlefield) to compel the government to send you more men, or better cannons, or special officers. Your general(s) inspire morale in their troops on the battlefield but cannot do any combat and will run from all enemies that attack him. Artillery cuts lanes in the battlefield. If you enjoy battlefield tactics, this game (really more than a game- it's an historic US civil war simulator) is well worth your time.

The battles are also SO stacked against you it's not even funny. If you are defending, the enemy outnumbers you almost always more than 2:1. Even on the 'easy' difficulty, its very difficult to make any progress. And in battles when you have a lot of forces, it is super difficult to manage and give all of them orders.

Pros

1. The Battles are fun and the maps are neat

2. The Enemy AI can be smart and a good challenge sometimes

3. The Controls are Nice


Cons

1.The AI can be dumb and run into the enemy and retreat into the enemy

2.The game isnt really being updated

3. you really just follow a script of battles which does just get repetitive 

4. The battles themselves are fairly restrictive in the sense that you can only control a certain area at a time, not the entire battlefield (This is only the case in some battles)

This game's campaigns is very stale for one, same set of battles each time with these smaller set up battles in between. This could have been an interesting premise but your performance in the major battles does not affect the war in any meaningful sense. One extremely noticeable battle is the 1st battle of bull run, now had the Union secured a decisive victory as I did during my go of the battle, then the civil war would have been very different. An early victory here would have emboldened the Union to be more aggressive and it would have broken cohesion of the rebels. Now would that make for a fun campaign, probably not but it would add much more replay ability to the game. 

Now for the worst part of the campaign, the difficulty level. This game suffers from one of the worst difficulty heights I have seen in a while. So much so that playing on normal is so easy that i have never even scored a draw in my 15 hours of playing. While hard if so difficult that I have to try every mission at least 4 times before I get the hang of it. Now this fucking sucks for a lot of reason. One while for some people this level of play is fun, and i understand why it is this is something that would often fall under a very hard or legendary difficulty kind of deal. For those who play a lot and like to try try try again until they succeed. For this game I am not interested enough to play each level 4 times before I can move on. A good amount of the fun in this game is playing a battle for the first time and not knowing what the enemy is gonna do, having to react in real time. That is fun and is why total war battles have found their way too many hearts.  In this game however the ai will spawn in the exact same spot everytime and will move to the same spot every time. It will act in a way that is historical. While that is great and all, game play wise its dog shit. If you were Napoleon or Grant or Lee or Alexander or fucking anyone and you could just rewind the clock on the battle you would be the greatest general to ever exist. Knowing exactly where the enemy is and what its going to ruins all of the fun, especially when you have to inorder to beat the damn mission. 

Now I am in my final year of university for a bachelors in history and will be moving on to a masters program so I do enjoy history quite a lot. I however firmly believe that games are about changing history and understanding how just one small movement of the pieces can change everything.

The ai is lackluster to say the least, the Union will rarely ever dedicate its whole force at one time and instead will attack one by one. The rebels do not hold position and instead when its a defensive battle for them they will charge you. Now maybe due to incompetency this did happen quite a lot in the civil war I know of an instance at gettysburg where a Union commander almost lost the battle because he was way out of position. 

Overall this game has all the mechanics of a good game but the campaign is so frustratingly difficult or boring easy. The campaign is the game in a sense, if it does not work the game does not work. I would instead hold out for the Armchair historians new game that is coming later this year.

If you're at all passionate about the battles of the American Civil War, you'll find it hard not to be engrossed in the dedication taken to each and every motion the game places you in: moving from day-to-day, attack to counter-attack and so on. It's a unique kind of RTS in that you'll come to know its own system of morale, ammo and structure. It's a line battle game and the tactics you'll be employing are built deeply around that, meaning while it's relatively straight forward, complicated manoeuvres can be difficult to pull off successfully. The fun lies in making it work or hanging on against all odds, but the occasional jankiness of UG:CW can make it an infuriating situation (I'm looking at you ""FLANKED!"" notification when it's the tiniest of angles I'm moving parallel to an enemy division).

It's fun, but hard work, with long missions making this a surprisingly heavy time sink. The downside comes in the lack of dynamism in the main campaign. While I can fight optional missions that affect the morale/number/intelligence of the enemies I'm fighting in the big battles, it's a dumb, mystifying let down to receive captured enemy intelligence reports thereafter. Why bother telling me about the absolutely crushing defeat I've inflicted on them if they somehow always manage to muster up a fuckton of new recruits to fight me at the next battle? I get the point isn't to snowball, but god it would be fun to and arguably would have made these experiences more dynamic at the cost of their historical qualities, but better as a personalised experience.

Anyway, I wouldn't pay full price for this, but it's an easy buy during a sale. Just know you're going to have to learn a fair bit about how this works and adapt accordingly, it's a tough game but immersive if you're at all interested in the US Civil War. I'd love to see a future rendition of this with 3D models and a better representation of the carnage the battles meagerly represent. Still, nothing like standing atop a pile of confederate corpses.

the biggest issue is it has the illusion of freedom. You are permitted to buy forces and upgrade at your will. 
Not wanting to send my soldiers into a meat grinder i opted to upgraded their weapons for range and damage, and preferred a smaller deadlier force over thousands of meat shields. Unfortunately i progressed far enough with this strategy that I can no longer go further, since i don't have a large enough force to start the next battle. so that's it. start over and play with meat shields or walk away.

If they wanted the game to be played a specific way they should simply give you the recommended forces and take the freedom aspect out of it. especially since said freedom breaks the game. 

Another lesser issues is they divide your forces randomly, but you wont know how until the battle starts, so there is a lot of going back and reloading and replanning for a mission because they put all your infantry on one side of the map and all your cannons defenseless on another.

I will use the Battle of Chickamauga scenario playing as confederates as an example for why this is, as everything wrong with this game is present in microcosm. To start off, you are always outnumbered, even if you have crushed the Union army 20 different times up to this point. Furthermore, the enemy will always have better weapons than you, again even if you've badly beaten them repeatedly before. You have to hold out against overwhelming union forces who will charge without the slightest concern for casualties, inflicting horrific casualties on your own forces as you struggle to hold on to arbitrary Victory Points that will determine whether or not you win the battle. And if you lose, not only do you not get the vital manpower and money you need to rebuild your army, but you will instantly lose the entire game and be booted back to the menu. 

But you win the battle, against all odds and suffering unsustainable casualties. You barely have enough manpower and money left to refill your nearly destroyed units. And then you play the very next battle, and you realize that all of that was for nothing and the Union has magically refilled its ranks and is using the same tactics and you are even more outnumbered than you were before.

This game is the embodiment of trying to hold sand in your fingers, and if you're like me and are so OCD you have to complete everything then this it will probably give you a stroke. The only way to win this game is to cheese every battle and simultaneously get very lucky. Its the same for both sides, just a bit easier as Union.

Summary:
- No victory matters
- Battles are incredibly scripted around certain Victory Points
- The enemy AI is dumb as rocks
- Losing a single battle late game will cause you to lose
- You will bang your head on a table

This game is pretty damn addictive just from how fun it is and how much you can do to change what you do in each battle. I was actually able to learn about campaigns during the war and their important battles. There are a shit ton of battles in this game that I have yet to reach all of them just from the sheer amount. While in the beginning of the game it can be a bit of a hassle to actually get through as both Confederate and Union, the rest of the game is still pretty damn fun if you learn how to utilize each type of unit and their weapons, being able to rack up thousands of kills with just a 800 count infantry brigade. As well as just the cheeky feeling know you managed to capture an enemy behind their own lines using cavalry or 2 other infantry brigades. As well as just being able to get them to rout using nothing but skirmishers.

-  The Bad -

Though I do have some other gripes such as how larger units actually take more damage than they do and are just very difficult to command due to how slow they are in terms of movement, even if that does make sense. There's also how you can't really choose what parts to attack on your own since parts of the map are just completely restricted to you unless you wait out the timer which sucks a lot like in the Fredericksburg battle. It's better to skip trying attack at the 2nd phase due to the lack of cover and sheer amount of artillery so I just always have to wait it out in order to actually do some damage, but even then I have to move all of my units down into the forest in order to actually be effective. It'd be better if you could actually decide where your units go besides these decided spot on the map or at least allow to skip the timer. But those are just a few issues with the game that I have with it.

- Conclusion -

Even with those issues in the game, the ups of it just completely overpower it just from how fun it is to try and command an army and kick the enemy's ass. It's especially fun if you find new ways to lead your army by small parts in the map where you can cross a river or get behind the enemy and try and get them to rout. Not to mention the fact that you can always get better in each battle by trying out new things. I managed to destroy almost the entire enemy army at Malvern Hill just by having less men in each brigade. It's super fuckin' fun and I would totally recommend it to anyone. Interest in history or not this is a solid strategy game. I would like to hear what other people have to say about this game in terms of bad and good things, as there may be some things I missed out on or some thing that people may have to add on to.",1626241027,1626241027,True,17,0,0.700633704662322998,0,True,False,False

I got all the way to Shiloh and was at least 25 hours into the game before I found out you can create skirmishers from any infantry unit and not just have to rely on the units you create for your corps. There is a map that suggests  you use skirmishers to delay and I had no clue it meant to use the detach ability to do so. I must have played that initial battle (as CSA) at least 10x and now I'm going to discard all my progress and try it again, this time with the ability to play it 'properly.'

Manage and Army in the Civil War in an XCOM-like format and fight across major battles throughout the American Civil War. The issue is that it is executed so poorly that I cannot in any capacity recommend this game.

After trying the first couple of battles, I was extremely unimpressed. The A.I. is terrible and cheats to try and beat you. Vastly larger soldier counts (even on Brigadier general with max Army Organization), blindly charging a single position, being heavily resistant to flanking and killing their general does nothing to their morale. The battles and overall campaigns are extremely heavy scripted which disincentivizes any form of strategy in favor of min/maxing. No matter what you do, the enemy will not lose sufficient reinforcements for what you accomplish, which realistically doesn't make any sense. If the Union won both the 1st Battle of Bull Run, the Second and Fredericksburg, the CSA would have crumbled. The only thing keeping them in the war was the crazy victories Jackson and Lee were able to inflict on the Union. Because of this, it feels a lot less like a war and more like a movie you are watching.

If you are someone that like RTS's such as Age of Empires, Company of Heroes, Command and Conquer or Total War, stay away from this game. It is not worth any amount of money due to just how frustrating the mechanics are. The combat is the worst I have ever seen in a game like this. Cannons are useless unless you are shot gunning them in the face, cannons can fire through trees and soldier right in front of them. This really is not a strategy game and is not fun. I wish I could defeat the ZERG Confederates in the game by doing the last thing I can think of, refunding the game, but unfortunately I cannot.

Dislikes: 

Units are difficult to control and some things seem like they would be simple programming fixes.  Brigades in the same division do not deploy together at the beginning of battles, the first division is always split up on opposite sides of the deployment box forcing you to spend the first few minutes reorganizing so you can command divisions as a unit.  The maximum number of units that you can select at one time is smaller then the maximum number in a full corps (24 units).  So when trying to manuver a corps together, you have to do it division by division or end up leaving some units behind.  The sliding of stacked units is just stupid at times, with units sliding the longest distance to become unstacked, rather then sliding the shortest distance.",1624474498,1624474498,False,5,0,0.560975611209869385,0,True,False,False

This is a great strategy game but it has a very deep learning curve. There are many guides out there that do help but even on the most easiest difficulty you will struggle, especially if you're new to strategy games.

That said, give it a shot if you enjoy line warfare whilst making sure your cavalry and cannons are in the perfect positions for ultimate effectiveness.

The degree of difficultness can also be attributed to the army management screen. I won't list these here but before and after a battle you will be able to customise your army with either Infantry, Skirmishes, Cavalry and Artillery divisions. You will also get to choose what equipment they bring to battle and how you, as a General will focus on building army, either through putting points into Politics for that extra cash after a battle or medical so that your forces don't loose as many men after each battle.

I've only played the campaign, which is a top down select which battle to play etc. Usually their is a final battle on that area of the map you can do at the end to progress the campaign (ALWAYS do the mini battles first, they help negate the enemies forces with de-buffs / extra skills and cash in the final battle but be warned, suffer to many casualties and it would all be in vain.

I like the historical aspect and the combat but the game's ai whether its the pathfinding or the enemy ai are complete idiots or its complete cancer. Enemy units of 300 dudes will retreat behind your advancing line and will come back and shoot you from behind. Sometimes your own units will be engaged in a fire fight with an enemy unit then will decide to charge for no reason into a hoard of enemy troops instantly dying. Lastly, the game doesnt seem to know what can count as a victory or what should count as one other than the ""historical"" objectives. For example, I played the battle of Chickamauga and I had managed to encircle the enemy army between the defensive positions you hold and the objectives your tasked with taking. I had managed to take all of the objectives and hold onto the defensive objectives until the last 6 seconds when the enemy human waved their way through the center and captured one objective pretty much furthering their encirclement but i lost the objective. When i sent my hoards of infantry upon them and shattered them with artillery the battle ended before i could retake the point saying I was defeated. The casuality count was 32 thousand for the enemy and 18 thousand for me. I am very intrigued as how this can count as a loss from any perspective other than ""historical reasons"". Because it baffles me how an encircled army with all avenues of escape cut off and with the enemy army closing in some how wins because they took a single mill road that would have been retaken if the battle had continued for another 15 seconds.

UGCW has filled a gap for me, a gap that Total War has yet to try and fill, and probably never will. It's historically accurate to the period, with two long campaigns and several playable historical battles, like Gettysburg or Shiloh, Chickamagua and Chancellorsville etc. It has an AI that's brutally efficient, pressing the attack and attempting to outmaneuver the player. The music is somber but highlights the glory of the era. The sounds are amazing, you can hear roar of cannon and the pop of musketry as infantry go on the attack, screaming as they charge with bayonets and swords.

The campaign is fairly in depth. It's a linear experience mostly, but you can customize your army as you see fit. You can adjust weapons and supplies, size of brigades, corps, and divisions. Officers and their units gain experience as they fight on, making them more efficient on the battlefield.

As for things I don't like? I think the enemy AI and the scaling can be a little unfair at some points. Sure, some of that could be my awful RTS skills, I won't deny. But the fact I can decimate several enemy divisions in several battles and they still have massive resources in 1863 is a little absurd. 

Overall, it's a delightful RTS, and has a fair amount of replayability. Definitely pick up if you're a history nerd like me.",1622887564,1622887564,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It provides one the chance to really excel at shaping battles in advantageous ways to attain victory for one's side in this titanic conflict.  The animation style though relatively simplistic is still visually pleasing.  The various mechanics of customizing your army with specific types of training and weaponry is much appreciated, and these historical battlefields are truly lovingly rendered.

I do however do have a handful of complaints where the game falls short:
- I wish there was more unique descriptions of what happens to your character depending upon specific victories or failings after the war in either victory or defeat.  Perhaps one's pre-chosen career path before the game and/or the stats you focused could affect this.  Like if you focused hard on the Political Stat you would have a political ending.  Whereas in a recent playthrough I put only a moderate amount of points into finance and yet became a Banker after the war. Despite maxing out other skills like Politics, Military Organization, etc.
- I also wish there were some more potentially intriguing political choices in the game and consequences for victories and defeats.  Like, if you lose the Battle of Gettysburg as the Union, Lincoln is not reelected and your Commander in Chief for the remainder of the war is McClellan.  Or if you lose at Antietam, Lincoln does not release the Emancipation Proclamation.
- There are also a few major battles I think the game sorely misses out on.  In particular post 1862.  For example Vicksburg is not a Siege Battle we can engage in.  And the March to the Sea is not focused on as strongly as it could have been.
- I also wish there were more unique Historical units.  We receive the Iron Brigade as the Union, and the Cavalry under Forrest for the Confederacy.  But what about the Irish Brigade amongst many other unique and famous units?  I think the exclusion of such units, as well as famous black units for the Union, is a major missed opportunity.

Aside from these minor complaints however it is still a quite excellent game and I heartily recommend it for any history buffs out there.  Especially if you can pick it up when its on sale at some point.",1622303409,1622303409,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics and details are great too.

I'm a huge fan of Ultimate General: Gettysburg and highly recommend that game but not this one. Anybody complaining about graphics obviously never played Gettysburg and doesn't care about strategy and overall game play, their probably just someone who wants every game in 4K with 120fps! Who cares! The graphics of your game can be amazing but if the game play sucks then why bother!? This game is all about strategy and tactics not graphics. That being said I am very disappointed in the strategy and tactics of this game.

For starters Artillery is absolutely useless in this game. The artillery doesn't break up enemy formations or charges. It inflicts very little casualties until point blank range with canister fire.

I also find fortifications to be completely useless. For instance if enemy forces come at your fortifications from a slight angle your troops will completely ignore them until in melee mode. The casualty rate is also not effected at all by fortifications. My units will suffer loses at the same rate whether their in fortifications or not.

The AI is also horrible it lacks any strategy at all. Rather than attempting to outflank your positions or pound you with artillery to weaken you, the AI will just send everything it has at you in a frontal assault over and over again. The worst part about this is that the AI will always be better than you at a frontal assault. It doesn't matter how much your front ranks outnumber the enemy they always push you back and route your units!

The lack of strategy is also effected by the timers and limits you to trying to push the enemy off the field as quickly as possible before the end of the day/timer. In real life some battles would last for days with one army just trying to maneuver around a hill and take it. In this game your limited to just a few hours. As the Union you should be able to mass produce artillery and just pound rebel positions into submission just like real life, however the balancing aspect of the game doesn't allow this. It doesn't matter how much you spend on weapons or making your army bigger they always match you. It is very frustrating when playing as the Union and being matched in manpower, artillery, and equipment in every battle. In reality the rebels largest factory in Richmond produced only 30000 rifles over the entire civil war Springfield Armory produced 15-20000 a month. The rebels should be outnumbered and outgunned in every battle that's reality! The most frustrating part of all that though is the Artillery being completely ineffective. Even if you make over half your army artillery and buy as many cannon as you can you'll be overrun in a matter of seconds because they don't stop, slow down, or inflict any real damage upon the enemy.

The final frustrating point is the campaign. My problem with it is that there is no way to fight a different battle. Your always fighting the same battles over and over again and it doesn't matter if you win battles you should've lost. For instance if you win First Bull Run as the Union you continue the campaign as if you lost it. The reality is that if the Union won First Bull Run then the Union would very quickly have been knocking on the door of Richmond early in 1861. If your the Union and win Second Bull Run Lee still invades the North. The reality is that Lee would not have invaded the North if he lost Second Bull Run. 

So overall this game needs a lot of improvement before I can recommend it and it's disappointing because I really want to!

For some Historical reference check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrXxz4iniRs 
If you don't understand the strategy of the civil war you will after watching. You'll understand why Robert E. Lee was so aggressive despite being outnumbered and outgunned all the time!

I also have more hours in the game than Steam is recording because I'm not always online. Something Steam needs to fix!

UPDATE: May 2021

With the release of Grand Tactician: The Civil War I've been playing Ultimate General Civil War again for comparison. Unfortunately this game still has a negative review from me. Despite improvements made to the game over the years the overall game play is still lacking. This game lacks and campaign strategy it remains just a Civil War arcade battles game. If that's what your looking for then this game is for you. However that is not what this game was marketed as. When i purchased the game I was expecting what eventually became Grand Tactician: The Civil War. In that game i can move armies all over the place. In that game there is a campaign strategy I can take Richmond early in 1861 as the Union and continue marching the AoP further South all while having trouble containing the rebels in Missouri! 

While the artillery in UG:CW is improved not so heavily nerfed as it was a few years ago my original points about the type of weaponry being useless still stands.It doesn't matter how well armed my Union army is the rebels always match it. the Rebel army always rivals my size so raising huge vast army is useless. Better to keep it small and rely on the other armies in the big battles and preserve your army for the battles in between.

Because of the style of the campaign your still dragging this one army all over the South and fighting in every major battle which also takes away from the realism. Fighting the Battle of Shiloh on April 6-7, 1862 and then fighting the Battle of Cross Keys on June 8, 1862 with the exact same army completely takes away from the idea of a true campaign. The logistics of such a movement of a massive army would not allow for such a marvel in 1862 for either side.

In the battles themselves my original complaints also stand there is no ability to change the strategy of any battles the way UG: Gettysburg mastered. It doesn't matter how many times you fight the battle of Shiloh once you figure out a winning strategy you will play the battle the same way every time. Also the way it breaks up a battle map into sections and makes you fight the battle in sections also takes away any true strategy the game COULD allow. This is something GT:TCW masters actually and gives you the map for a large area and allows you to fight anywhere on the map and approach a battle differently than they were fought IRL. For instance Chancellorsville is always fought the way Hooker and Lee fought it IRL in UG:CW. In GT:TCW i can be more aggressive as AoP and not halt at Chancellorsville and actually push Lee.

In the end this game is nothing more than a Civil War Battles Arcade game, and unfortunately that's all it will ever be for me. If you want a true Civil War strategy game along with being able to fight the battles my ultimate recommendation is Grand Tactician: The Civil War!",1487453750,1621991810,False,39,0,0.629763424396514893,10,True,False,False

Victory is often a mixed bag. When you feel you can't have your cake and eat it too, You can win with objectives or you can win by simply smashing the ever living shit out of the enemy and killing more of them than they kill of you.

pros
great movement system 
engaging battles
difficult but not impossible on harder difficulties
makes you cherish some of your corps and not want to waste them
great amount of diversity in battles
amazing art style and special effects
great camp vs battle - i really enjoy the way the whole campaign works

cons 
melee is crazy - i have no idea why a bigger force with better melee weapons looses when charged after peppering them with bullets - might be something im missing but AI seems to charge a lot and win every time. it gets to the point where i fall back at every charge
armies will just appear - at the edge of the map even when your troops are standing right there and can ruin your best units, there needs to be some sort of warning that a force is coming. 
defences like trenches and fences - the thought is there but when 3 units can shoot at your 1 behind cover you'll lose every time. it seems like you're way better not to use the cover given and just stand in some bushes.
POWs - not sure whats happening with them but it seems broken, when 600 men are being hammered by arty and 6000 men they don't surrender, it seems like taking prisoners is near impossible sometimes but as confed you need to take them for late game. 
Cav - when saber cav are chasing a fleeing unit , who obviously wont surrender, the unit can rally and beat your Cav in melee. Which makes them useless in most situations i only use rifle cav as there's no point have sword cav.
Skill point tree - great way of customising your army how you like it - more info or more men/guns. but on higher difficulties you have to go a specific route, money and men first. politics is all that matters at the start, then eco, and army size. could maybe have more skills so you don't have to go the same route every time.

After each battle you gain money, new recruits and XP and need to buy weapons and grow your army. Currently half way through the union campaign (20 hours in and only at 1/4 of the game!) and my army has grown to tens of thousands of men in 3 corps and 15 divisions. You can customize your army however you want. Choose the brigade type (artillery, skirmisher, cavalry or just plain infantry), the size, weapon and perks for your veteran brigades.

The battles can be a real challenge and positioning, cover and reconnaissance are very important. The enemy AI can be derpy at times, but it will try to outflank you and be really sneaky. Some battles have multiple phases, where more of the map becomes available. This can be annoying, because a flank which was secured, can suddenly become wide open.

The graphics look pretty, there are plenty of guides and the community is helpful and made some good mods. Definitely worth the price.

As usual, it takes a little time to learn how to move units correctly, yet that is not that difficult, just a little time consuming.
The rts AI is solid and makes for a good game. Yes, it can, and will stomp a hole in your inner 'Alexander The Great' or, Patton, or Rommel if you don't know how to fight as an army with cohesive unit(s) via sound strategy and tactics. 
The 'game board' presents problems for me because of certain vision problems and color blindness. Yet the 'board' is certainly an integral part of the game, and warrants taking time to study the 'terrain' the battle will take place on.
Get the Gettysburg game also; it is the equivalent of smash mouth foot ball for computer war games. 
In light of the correctly modeled 'Napoleonic era tactics' used by both sides, one can quickly see why the casualty numbers for both sides became horrendous as the war drug on. This aspect of the game is sobering.

Try attacking Richmond outnumbered 2-1 by all elite Confederate units with advanced weaponry. Just getting through the fucking first couple 'tutorial' scenarios required half a dozen reloads. Certain scenarios you can't bypass if you lose. ""Oh you lost part of your entrenchments at Cold Harbor to wave after wave of  stacked Confederate units while we only let your reinforcements come onto the battlefield in the last 30 minutes without enough time to sprint to the objective? You lose. Reload and try again three more times."" Literally many of the battles I'm supposed to attack the AI will actually attack me because it's so stacked against me.

I played through three campaigns. A lot of stuff in the campaigns doesn't make sense at all. There are little-to-no ahistorical scenarios even within the battles themselves. The game obviously wasn't playtested thoroughly or the developers had zero respect for their customers. For example as Shiloh for the CSA - if you manage to take Pittsburgh landing, it makes zero difference. It still advances to the next day and now you don't have Pittsburgh landing. The flag will even show as CSA but the Union will have all the fortifications you already won. Apparently the designer considered this feat impossible

The conditions and the timer will work against you when you're ""supposed"" to lose or be pushed back even if you totally disagree with the way the game will change objectives and force you to fall back when you might be crushing the enemy or you might lose a battle or end up with a draw in a scenario due to a technicality. It gets old and invites the reload-and-fix mentaity in spades because it's so dumb. I kick the AI's ass and very often when it's a good fight it will be cut short by a scenario end or a change in objectives. 

It pains to me to think what could have been. My first campaign I assumed that there was multiplayer. I was like ""oh well, that was kind of an anti-climactic end to my months-long campaign playing time, at least there's multiplayer."" And then there isn't.

I played both side's grand campaigns . You begin gradually buidling your own Corps (up to five of them) with a set number of divisions and brigades you can have depending on your stats. You get ""Career points"" over the course of the campaign that you can expend to pad your stats in a number of areas such as organization (size of units), medical (recovering casualties), training (recruiting veteran troops), ammunition starts, recon (seeing what the AI army will have beforehand) and a bunch of other things. Additionally you create and equip all the units you field with what you are given. As the war goes on other weapons become available in larger numbers and you can replace the old ones or re-equip units however you see fit with what weapons you captured or bought or were given.

For the most part you fight with all the forces you made. On occasion you will have other garrison units or especially cavalry outfits for specific battles which are not part of your command but still your's to control for that battle. Those are usually trap scenarios. You don't have to play every mission available to you. Look at the dates of the battle so that you don't skip any that you don't want to skip. Generally they are an opportunity to get more money, manpower, and career points. You can lose battles and you should understand the victory conditions before you plan. Some battles do not make it all that clear that you will get more time and continue to extend based on circumstances (which were pre-planned by the mapper).

Combat is better than in Ultimate General Gettysburg. You are no longer 100% reliable on the Corps commanders for helping your units' morale recover, they'll recover on their own. Effectiveness, reload time, range, and deadliness is all effected by what muskets, cannons, carbines, or repeating weapons  (whcih are way too watered down) that you give your guys. You can take any given brigade and deploy a battalion of skirmishers which is very useful for scouting and working against artillery or side threats. Your units' various veterancies come with perks you can pick. You can recruit replacements between battles. Artillery is not quite as overpowered while still remaining potent with proper support. Long range artillery (solid shot in this game) is almost useless (24 guns inflicting at most ~5 casualties a volley) for their ammunition expense, except for targeting precious enemy artillery to support your infantry. A ""target artillery"" button would be very helpful for the guns that occasionally will lose sight of their target and then turn to the nearest infantry. You also can no longer select your ammunition type, like you could in Gettysburg.

There are some other small quirks. I don't quite understand why you have a Lutheran seminary model in Ultimate General Gettysburg but other random structures that don't resemble it on the battlefield in this version's Gettysburg. Unless I'm missing something, there's a lack of labeling on the map. The intro may refer to specific spots on the field but without knowledge of the battle you won't know where / what they are. Fortifications are a big problem at times. It's often sadly true that putting your men in designated places for defense is more detrimental than it is helpful. Sometimes it will subject my guys to a ""flanking fire"" regardless of where the fire is coming from and they will quickly rout. Very often my units will not fire with all their might when in a defensive structure -- putting them in a losing fight despite the protection afforded. I don't quite understand the conditions causing units to surrender. Sometimes when they are overran, exhausted, and routed, they will surrender quickly. Other times they won't ever until they lose enough men to simply vanish into a placeholder mob of men which freely leaves the battlefield unharassed (desertion?). 

You can't rotate the map around. Even Sid Meier's Gettysburg! (1997ish) allowed this so it's kind of a surprise that they designed it so you can't. The field is only visible from two angles, straight from above and a little cocked to the side. The end of the campaigns is a little rushed, it basically goes from Cold Harbor to your last battles. The Western theater is forgivably mostly ignored other than some major battles (no Atlanta campaign). Also, as many have pointed out, the default speed of gameplay is quite fast and I'll generally play on the slower setting. 

The AI is challenging at times but once you become used to the basics it will cease being a major challenge. UNTIL YOU TRY the higher difficulty levels where it's just stupid. The AI gets elite troops every scenario and always have better weaponry. Many battles (Union and Confederate) I obliterate the opposing army on the 'normal' modes. During my campaigns I inflicted twice or more of my number of casualties which I took during the campaign. The AI reacts poorly to breakthroughs. If you smash through one area the defenders will often stay in their fortifications or trenches allowing you to come up behind and shoot them. Sometimes they'll try to march right by your men to get back to those defensive positions. The AI is also a poor attacker, you can only really be overwhelmed when in a poor spot or at very bad odds. I am an old-school gamer. I always complete Singleplayer before multiplayer. That's what I did over months. So I was a little sad that when I took D.C. and I took Richmond after all that hard work that I can't compete against other humans. I was really looking forward to doing that in a way I fought against humans in Gettysburg! and other Civil War games.

Overall, the campaigns are entertaining and a little challenging. The replayability comes in the units you build and how you fight the battles. Bring your full complement of troops, you'll need them. I just wish I could fight other humans.",1524609113,1618979431,False,3,0,0.553219437599182129,1,True,False,False

THE BAD: It's a historically interesting game that is well designed, but it's stupid hard after a certain point and just becomes ridiculous. In campaign mode, after the battle of Gettysburg it is just dumb. Playing as the CSA is actually easier than being the Union, which doesn't make any sense, and there is no way to win without conquering a battle royale style final battle with all of the CSA heavy hitters present, of course a final showdown between your general and the man himself, Robert E. Lee. During the final battle campaigns, the only way to win is to send thousands of soldiers up hills and against impenetrable walls; victory is only attained through sheer brute force. For this reason, the game becomes really silly. 

THE GOOD: Amazing game play on the historical battles and for the first half of campaign mode. Building armies is a lot of fun and challenging and there is a lot of rich historical information. Optional battles in campaign mode offers a lot of flexibility and brings a strategic influence to the game. Having your line spanning the battle field and cutting down the enemy as they attack is quite a fulfilling experience, and really brighten your day. Up until Gettysburg (and during), this game is just incredible. Historical Battles are all also quite interesting and challenging to play. 

THE UGLY: After a certain point and on the higher difficulty levels, the AI just starts throwing itself at your lines in a desperate attempt to break them. In the worst scenario, I inflicted 58,000 casualties on the CSA at the battle of Cold Harbor, a horrific event that would have not only ended the Civil War, but likely would have ended the south and anything to do with the Confederate cause forever. Also, reorganization of the army in camp can be very clumsy and frustrating. No way to combine brigades or divisions, no way to swap, (unless there is free space) and career points are needed to increase the size of the army, which makes choosing skills obvious and silly (you have to choose the one that increases your army size). Also ugly is that Brigade and Division leaders are often killed or wounded rather randomly, which effectively removes them from the game, however, Corp Commanders are never lost, even if they are destroyed on the battle field. Also, soldiers behave like mindless zombies who relentlessly throw themselves into suicide situations, thus resulting in highly unrealistic maneuvering and tactics that just would never be seen on a real battlefield. Finally, and worst of all, the game doesn't let you setup the battlefield, and is instead highly inflexible in who and where your troops deploy, usually resulting in very awkward starting positions that would never occur in the real world. This makes for a frustrating experience when you can't execute the tactical plan you had because the game restricts you from doing so for no reason other than apparently making it harder to win. In one example, I had all of my artillery deployed on the other side of the field from my infantry, and enemy Cavalry just attacked them and routed half of my brigades. It was just stupid.

You can use real tactics and maneuvers in your formations

But the main issue with this game is the exact same issue I had with Battle Tech.  The ""progression"" in this game is a lie.  The game uses ""Tiers"" i guess is what you'd call them. Once you go over a certain point with your troops then the ai will automatically upgrade their armies to that next tier. So in a sense no matter how well you play you can never get ahead, and often times it puts you at a disadvantage. Lets say you barely cross that ""Tier line"", then you'll be fighting numbers and quality troops highest in that tier. 

You'll also notice whatever side you're fighting against has an incredible breeding program while you're always struggling.

then this a good game despite it broken flanking mechanics

You can easily resize units to 10k each, makes it hard to position with massive units but it's good fun

The union campaign is the easiest of the two

With the rebalance mod then hard mode is genuinely hard , lot of love and hard work gone into that mod and it corrects 70% of the glaring flaws of the base game

And to keep the game fun you'll maybe want to add some resources to your side or harder setting are just a slog to survive and very little actual fun

I have played 47 hours at this point I have massive experience at playing these types of games. I would like to think my review here will be taken seriously.

Problems I am seeing are that no matter what you seem to do the game will not allow you to win battles playing the confederate side. I played entire campaign more then once and I have won only a couple battles with some draws as a confederate. Even playing historical battles that the confederacy won.  Something that seriously pissed me off is that as a confederate, historically the Army of Northern Virginia was a defensive fighting army yet the game forces you to constantly attack opposed to playing defensive. Meaning you are trying to attack against overwhelming odds every battle. When I have played the union side it is the same thing. A difference being the computer creates the confederate units as being the same size or larger then yours even when historically the confederate side would have been drastically out numbered in that particular battle. Another big frustration is that the times I have turned the tide and am rolling up the enemy flanks the battle will suddenly end am I am told I lost,

Playing the customs battles is pretty much the same thing. No matter how big I create my units, with best weapons and leaders, the union is able to breach my defenses and cause my veteran units to route. 
The battle of Cold Harbor being a prime example. Something else I found out when you are creating your units for custom battles is If you build a unit then decide to disband it and rebuild it the game will not give you back the money you spent, which can be a huge chunk of money, It pretty much forces you to reset and start over or you are just out that money and the unit. 
Another thing I ran into when playing custom battles. I have bought weapons from the Armory only to have them not show up in my supply yet the money was gone. I also discovered that no matter how much money I put into the supply option I never had enough, the supply wagons seem to run out after resupplying only a couple units and my units will run out of ammo and be routed.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. By no means will I stop playing this game. I just want others to know what I have experienced. I welcome any suggestions on what I may be doing wrong and also welcome hearing about your experiences.

For example, when starting a campaign I create an ""avatar"" general to be me. But the highest I can be is a corps commander. So if I have multiple corps in my army, am I both army and corps commander? How am I ordering other corps to do things when I'm not their commander?

Beyond that, the full campaign has the player bouncing from east to west like a ping pong ball. I understand wanting to get all the major battles in, but it kind of ruins the realism.

The civil war game I really want is where the player starts as maybe a regimental commander (or higher, if they want), and works their way up the chain of command over time. This isn't that.

You could win 10 battles in a row and then lose one and be devestated for the rest of your campaign until you eventually get removed as General and have to start over.

One major issue I have is that it is extremely linear. Nothing you do makes a huge difference. For example, I've captured Trimble 3 times. In 3 battles, back to back, I've destroyed his brigade and he has surrendered to me, yet pops up in the next battle as if nothing has happened. Similarly the Civil war plays out exactly as it did in real life, regardless of how many battles you win. It kind of takes the fun out a bit.

The game has an rpg mechanic: you get some customization for the general as far as career which affects your specialties are. units can gain veterency and you can pick skills for them, same for corp commanders who have skills.
It has a nice army management layer: namely choosing the size (100-2500 men) of units, the type and quality of their weapons, and force management as far as choosing a balance of infantry, cavalry, artillery, and skirmishers.
And on a strategic level, you manage a campaign as either the CSA or Union, fighting a long series of battles where the casualties you inflict are reflected by the size of the army you're facing in the next battle, as well as their training and equipment level.

Battles flow, units rout, recover, reinforcements arrive in the nick of time. A well placed gun line can decimate an attack and entrenched troops are very hard to dislodge. It feels as if you have to make critical decisions on deployment, reserves, defence and attack. 
The time limits are well judged for each part of a battle and you sometimes hold on by the skin of your teeth to win. 
In between battles  you need to allocate resources and command points and decide whether to enlarge the army, recruit green or experienced troops, invest in better weapons etc.
It would perhaps be better to be able to play your character as an army commander rather than corps commander, maybe with the ability to boost the command of corps commanders in a vital sector.
Also the campaign follows the same path as the historical battles so your army is jumped rather unrealistically between Eastern and Western theatres with the same forces. Perhaps 2 campaigns for East and West would be better.
It's also a shame that the campaign ends at Cold Harbour and not the end of the war but I guess the siege of Petersburg and battles around Appomatox don't give much scope for scenarios.
Having said that I love the scale of the battles, they feel large and you can quite intuitively control large forces.

Only two criticism:
1. I do think it's missing a level editor/community option so the battle list could be more fleshed out and give this game more replay value
2. I wish both the single battles and campaign had less scripting/more open-ended play. It's a bit frustrating that battles often get broken up for linear, predefined cutscenes, and I wish there were more freedom to just play start to finish with the only interruptions being seamless troop arrivals (which happened in Gettysburg and does happen sometimes in Civil War). Same for the campaign - wish there were more (or any) strategy in terms of troop movement and strategy.

Overall, UG:CW is a really good game that I continue to go back to over other strategy games.

Even though they were level 3 veteran units at a regiment level of 400 men they were still able to withstand an onslaught of 2 of my Brigades with a combined strength 2800 men both of level 2 veterancy. Don't get me wrong I know I can fall into a thermopylae defense against a strong willed enemy but no civil war regiment can lose more than half of their unit in a single engagement and remain in the fight. At one point 95 men were holding a defensive area against 2000 of my men, and my men were about to rout with my general standing next to them. Good brochure of weaponry widely used during the conflict but every once in a while the stats were nerfed.

A game should be fun, this isn't fun when you have to continually re-fight a battle to try to win the thing.  I am okay a couple of times but I am only at Shiloh as Confederates and I am re-fighting it for maybe the fourth or fifth time?  Lost interest and it's time to move on.  

The game is nice, I would love to zoom in closer like Total War though.  I like the character options and army building, sound is nice, battlefields are beautiful and allow you to make use of positions for defense.  

On the negative though, showstopper for me is the lack of fun factor, It is a little too hard to win and I suspect this has forced many players to quit if I read the accomplishments right (low percentage completed after one or two battles).  

I really hoped when I pick the easiest level I actually won't have to keep re-fighting battles and could have some fun.  At easiest settings, the battles are a bit too challenging.  By this I mean you are being asked to assault a town or defensive line and the enemy gets reinforcements and outnumbers you and is more mobile and keeps circling around you and taking victory locations so you wonder if the battle will ever end and it just feels like work.

I switched to Union and couldn't win the first battle on the easiest setting.

Ultimate General: Civil War is a great single player strategy game and much of this comes from the way the campaigns are structured. Battles are scripted to represent historical strategic realities, and brigades carry over from battle to battle with an upgrades and equipment system. The scripting system allows for multi-stage/multi-day battles, large battles with multiple fronts, piecemeal reinforcements, and the changing of objectives mid battle. The campaign initially gives the player only a few divisions to control, and most of the early battles are fought by units that do not carry over from battle to battle. As the campaign continues a larger percentage of the army is paid for by the player and by the battle of Second Bull Run the entire army is managed by the player. This game has hand crafted scripted historical battles that have the player using armies they designed over course of a war and it works very well.  

This game is balanced to be reflective of historical realities, but this makes one campaign nearly impossible on higher difficulties. The Union has access to more money, soldiers, and better weapons, but are more often expected to storm defensive trenches. More standardized production, rising conscription, and new innovations make the Union army more powerful over the course of the game. The Confederates get less of everything, but more often get easier defensive missions until the late game and are awarded legendary generals earlier into the game. During the late game the Confederates are expected to go on the offensive for battles like Gettysburg and even storm well defended fortresses while outnumbered. This can easily drain the player of resources. The customization options are not just a way for the player to customize their armies, but also a way for the developers to force the player to consider the bigger picture while playing the game. Even with intensive micromanagement, long-term planning and rampant exploit abuse the Confederate campaign is nigh impossible on the hardest settings, but this makes sense.  

There is a large number of exploits, glitches and issues with balancing that can ruin the game for new players. [spoiler]Detaching skirmishers will trick the AI into changing targets, halting all firing and even abandoning their defenses to make a suicidal charge.  Most defensive positions greatly reduce firepower and are broken in a way that leads to brigades being fired on from behind by units they are facing from the front.  With some defenses firing on a brigade from the front from the right angle can instantly route a unit. Later Union trench battles can be cheesed by using snipers to shoot at a trench from the right angle to force a cheap instant route. Forests are incredibly overpowered as they allow units to maintain a high firing rate and take little damage. For the Confederate version of the battle of Second Bull Run the optimal strategy is to start the battle by abandoning the walls, trenches, and houses for a forest that should be the final line of defense.[/spoiler] This game has many issues and players would be wise to keep themselves ignorant of them. 

Ultimate General: Civil War has clearly had a lot of effort put into it, but more advanced play devolves into exploiting the game. Some levels on higher difficultys feel as though they were designed around being cheesed and exploited and that’s just not fun. However, the game at its core respects the history and provides a fair challenge. This game is 100% worth a few normal playthroughs, but please the challenge of the hardest settings is just tedium.",1614836302,1614836302,True,6,0,0.560277938842773438,1,True,False,False

Played this game a few years back and loved it. Recently came back and played through both campaigns all over again, and found that it is a game that does not lose its charm with time. 

My only critique really would be the soundtrack, which I felt didn't really reflect either side, or even the time period. However, this is minor, and turning the music off allows you to get really immersed in the sounds of battle. I am personally a fan of the sfx in this game.

 First, the battles are a bit slower paced. Not like a simulation, but not quite like a Total War game either. This means there's more emphasis on predicting how a battle will go prior to placing troops. Also you can't rely on troops to sprint from place to place so committing troops in one place or another can alter how the battle goes if your people are out of position. Units who are flanked, even by a little bit can quickly break and soon your whole line is breaking apart if you're not careful.

 This leads to another point. AI is smart enough to generally go toe to toe with you. They make good use of their units and can exploit weaknesses if they arise. However, I think a big portion for why they are so effective is because EVERY battle seems to have the enemy outnumber you in nearly every way. Their units are larger, i.e. more troops per unit, and they have more units. This is mostly in the campaign where apparently the enemy portions change specifically to outnumber your army.

 Despite that, this game is good fun and I recommend it to anyone who likes the history around the American Civil War, or just wants a tougher challenge when playing Total War or a game similar.",1613328651,1613328651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have been blown away. The more I play this game, the more I come to appreciate how fluid, balanced, and tactical it is. I love that there's just 5 kinds of units, enabling you to manage massive armies without getting overwhelmed. I love micro-ing my units, I love naming my units stuff like ""The Scooby Doos"" or ""Blue Man Group"" (Because the Union wears - nevermind, you get it). I love customizing weapons and officers before battles. I love telling my infantry to charge an artillery battery and hearing their battlecry. There are like 1000 little things in here that don't sound amazing on paper, but in the aggregate, those little details are what makes a great game great. 

One thing that I wanted to draw attention to is the fog of war. This game was one of the most opaque fogs of war (fog of wars?) I've ever played, and I LOVE IT. When you have no idea where your enemy is, it adds so much strategic depth to the game and also creates some hair-raising experiences (like when you hear a rebel battle cry coming at you from the forest, but you have no idea where it's coming from.

Most positive reviews here lack any mention of some serious deficiencies in command, mechanics, and the campaign, and from the small number of negative reviews it seems that only a small number of players ran into the same issues I did. I LOVE aspects of this game (particularly unit and army customisation), but since ""The Good"" has been covered by so many people, I'm going to focus primarily on the negative, but even with the positive, I would not recommend this game for a very important reason I will get to.

So as much as this is a standalone game, it should be remembered that the designer started his career in game design as a game modder- going on to create a comprehensive set of balance patches for Total War games that focused on a more flexible morale system and realism. The changes that his mods made in those games generally have now become the ""default"" for this game. Morale is more of a give and take, and rather than simply ""routing"" your units can leave and return to combat several times during the duration of a mission. Lots of casualties taken at once also are now more critical to your units morale, and flanking is even more important than in Total War games.

With that comparison out of the way, it's very obvious that despite learning what changes in mechanics from the Total War series were beneficial, Ultimate General is still one of his ""early"" games. Some quality of life improvements are missing (such as stances or formations that would be useful- as it is now you have no ability to quickly form up your units and must resort to slowly lining up units one by one before ""locking"" them into a stiff formation that cannot shift it's arcs of fire effectively), and the ""drag to"" command style, while sounding good hypothetically, is at best unneccessary 90% of the time, and at worst will actually draw BEHIND your unit if it's moving and cause them to about-face mid battle, often routing them immediately. These facing issues continue when your units ""fall back"" or rather, ""fall beside"", through their own right flank, again exposing themselves to enemy fire. When choosing a target, your unit may select an enemy group further away than others, again exposing their flank causing a rout.

""Innovative command system: You decide which level of control you want. Command every unit individually or just give them a main goal with one button click and watch if they can take that hill.""

No. This is a dreamy wish. Your friendly AI is lobotomised (think total war AI controlled army) and your individual units are incapable of handling themselves without constant micromanagement. Weirdly enough, the enemy AI seems competant, but that could be because they had a 5-15% advantage in numbers over me most of the campaign. I understand that people complained about this in the first game as well, but it doesn't seem to be quite capable yet. Additionally in a campaign where you're TOLD (""sometimes, foreshadowing can be relatively obvious"") that you will get better rewards if you take more objectives, you will NEVER cede control over to an AI if you can help it. 

I guess I should get to the anecdote that brought me to put the game down, saying ""Ah, I'll pick it up again a little later."" I have yet to pick it up again even though I enjoy the game immensely.

When you begin a mission, generally you have no idea what to expect. You will get basic information, like the number of armies you can field, and the aproximate composition of the enemy force, but your particular objectives or what they might CHANGE TO throughout the mission are absent. You do not get to see the number of days a mission can go for.

One major problem with this:

When you are composing your army, questions such as ""Should I recruit more men, or should I get the ones I have better rifles?"" arise. Often times it's best to go with a balance of both, but in certain situations a large force of moderately equipped troops WILL BE REQUIRED to smash through the often superior numbers of the enemy, and in others the exact inverse. On missions that last more than one day (of which there are a few), larger numbers of troops generally are needed to absorb the casualties of large fights. However since there is no way to know before the mission starts how many different stages of objectives it will have, or how many days it will go on, designing your army is a completely crap shoot the first time around.

Suddenly the mission you had properly provisioned for when you thought you only had one objective to capture/defend now goes on for another set of objectives or god forbid another day, forcing you to desperately push forward to capture it before you're destroyed, or to restart the mission with a different army now that you have the hindsight of save-scumming. You would think that a mission briefing would show you ALL your objectives at once, but no as the General you've decided you don't need to be privy to the exact objectives on the map until you've chosen your army and played through half the mission. What the fuck? I can understand the surprise of a whole other day of combat being REALISTIC but why would you not tell me plan B, and C?

And hell, it's not like YOU (as the general) get to decide if you want to fight another day, or split a small mission into a 2 day cake walk, THE GAME decides that for you, but still doesn't tell you when it has arbitraily decided to have a two-dayer. 

The worst perpetrator of this is a confederate mission that pits (even after acing all previous missions) 45000 Union troops, against (at my best) 37000-40000 troops. After spending the better part of my play time with this game just trying to get past the first sets of objectives with enough men that I didn't have to restart, it told me that if I pushed hard enough, I could take the hill and victory would be mine!

It was such a high, pushing harder than I had every pushed before, using the combined tactics of what remained of my advances rifle squads and my cannon-fodder line-riflemen. Several valiant charges later we broke through the defended position! We captured the objective, with the enemy recapturing it once more- WITHIN THE LAST 5 SECONDS I captured the point and secured it! I jumped out of my chair-

-only to see the game roll me over to the next day, move all of my units BACK to a previously captured objective, spawn a fresh set of union units on the hill (who then recaptured it before I could stop them) and give my entire army ZERO rest of recouperation/reinforcements.

I was heartbroken.

I don't mind buying this game as a thanks for all of the work he's done on the Total War games- as a thanks for the mods- but this game does not have a ""Dynamic Campaign"" or an ""Innovative Command system"", and the small quality of life failures (proper missions briefings, fall back, drag-to, moving goal posts) pushed me away from this game.

I've always wished that their would be a successor to Sid Meirs Gettysburg and Antietem. You have to use tactics and position your divisions to limit casualties to have any chance and winning the campaign. 

My only beef with this game is that it resets your army when another phase of battle starts (or another day)
You can have their whole army rolled up, and stuck in the corner of the map, then BAM! All the ground you gained and lives lost to secure the safest position for your army (Covered terrain) Your armies get moved to the historical starting position of each phase. I almost quit everytime this happens. 
I rolled up the Yankees up to the tree line in Chancellorsville and started my huge flank attack and now im back at the original road and will have to lose double the lives gaining the ground i already had.

P,S, Developers 
I would be hugly interested a game that is basically the exact same game but either Mexican-American war, Spanish-American war, Franco-Prussian war, Austro-Prussian wars.

I see many compaining about the AI not losing the troops lost due to previous battles when starting a new fight. This is would practically be impossible to program for, instead the devloper tried to make each fight interesting, balanced, yet realistic historically (in the amount of troops and everything else). When you win these battles, you do get more troops as a reward and in the next major battle the enemy will be penalized, with less troops or poorer weapons, so i think that's pretty balanced tbh. In addition you'll be fighting multiple different armies, so even realistically, many times your next campaign battle wouldn't be affected anyway in real life, as the next army you fight would be fresh, just like in the game.

This is however not a game for people who havent played lots of stratergy games before. If you havent it could be very difficult, as many of the reviews can verify. So be ready for that but i don't think they understand the game when they use it as a criticism. This game is made by stratergy gamers for stratergy gamers, looking for their next challange.

I would say that after you get the hang of it, it can be pretty fun. Obviously I have no life because I played the game for 37 hours at the time of review. The campaign goes in depth and you literally control the battle. You control each individual regiment and you control where it goes, what they do everything like that. It is not too complicated to get the reigns. Multiple times I was fired from being general because I am absolute trash at this game. But it was overall very fun. Like if you're like Justin and you're cracked at Fortnite, you'll be cracked at this game. No cap dog. And that my fellow soldiers from Privates, to NCO's, to Officers, to me the general, stand up and Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo! Say Geronimo! I am just kidding lol that would be absolutely hilarious Jarvis. THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE!!! No cap, this game is good. But on a serious note, this game is very good and I enjoy playing. Hence the many hours I have spent. Half of them, I tried to beat just the first battles, sometime s I couldn't even get past Shiloh and the 1st Battle of Bull Run without getting relieved of my positions as General. This game can be hard, but once you get the hang of it, a few hours into the game it is extremely fun and I have 37 hours of enjoyment. This game feels very rewarding once you complete battles and actually win. You get to add troops, customize your army, all the way down to the guns your troops use, and who leads those armies. You can hire troops, and you can have massive armies. You rise from a small general and lead all the way up to a heroic one that will go down in history. You can choose to be Confederate or Union, and as a Union it is much harder to start out and win. But it gets tougher on if you choose Confederate. With 37 hours, and this is sad, I haven't actually beat the game. I know it's sad, but I have faith in whoever gets this game, they shall become a greater general than me. Thank you for reading this long review, hope you found it helpful, enjoy your time on this game if you decide to buy it.

-A few single batles that can be fought individually; they are inconsistently made and some of them you get to control the actual strategy of the battle but usually not so much. Anteitem is good, other battles are not so well excecuted. 

-the AI is good but not can't be tinkered or modified to simulate the command style of specific generals. Syd's Gettysburg did that back in the early 90s but whatevs; these guys quit early and their game stinks by comparison to a game made more than 25 years ago.

-A ""campaign""  game that is nothing more than a series of scenarios on a rail so that no American Civil War can ever be won without a fighting at Gettysburg etc, as though those battles were inevitable (spoilers; they werem
t inevitable and they could have happened other locations on different ground). It's a real limitiation of the game.

-the graghics are good for this sort of thing but it's a little light on blood and not enough carnage. It dehumanizes the actual death price paid for these shenanigans.

-You can fight a battle where you define every parameter of every unit in a historical battle but you CAN NOT set it to give you random unknown values while walking into the fog of war. It's lame to ALWAYS know what you are facing and seems to indicate a poor unfinished game of limited value.

-Artillery  is well excellent and behaves like reports of the real items although there is a problem judging the dimension of hills upon which to place artillery making some it difficulat to choose good artillery locations without pausing the game and checking real maps that are less confusing. The details in gameplay seem to be there, the map looks like crap in this respect though. 

-History is highly creatively interpreted, examples include, ""battle-trains,"" difficulty running away from flanking fire, and foot skirmishers that are faster than mounted cavalry.

Cons
-None game is perfect @ $5 price level. More than that it is quite overpriced. 

I paid full price but no one else should ever so unless it were a finished game.  No replayability",1483743986,1610467566,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can have two 'troops' of units both 'clashing' into/thru each other when crossing a narrow bridge. 

The cover that buildings provide shouldn't apply if both divisions of forces are fighting each other in what is equivalently the same building.  

Divisions shouldn't receive a flanking penalty when being given a withdraw command (within reason).  

Divisions should be able to 'about face' to be able to turn around when assailed from the rear (distinct from 'wheeling' your force, I'm aware).  

Excessive casualties on a bridge or similar 'choke-point' should impede the passage of troops.  

Opposing cavalry shouldn't be able to glide through standing divisions of men.  

Responsiveness to commands should be a bit 'tighter' (weird delays when issuing orders).  

Etc. etc. etc.  

Close to a correct formula though.  It's simplicity invites you into the game, but there isn't enough there to keep you engaged IMHO.

I played a Union campaign and was enjoying the game play until i got to the battle of Shiloh. Basically that battle is unbeatable for me because i decided to upgrade troops instead of spam lots of them. I was outnumbered 4 to 1 by the CSA. Literally unbeatable and forced me to take a defeat. The campaign mode needs explanations on how it works because now that I messed up my first one, i have to start off. I appreciate a difficult challenge but going into the campaign completely blind isn't challenging gameplay, it's laziness by the dev.

There are some cool aspects to the game but don't waste your money this because it's basically Sid Meyer's: Gettysburg with a campaign mode that lets you customize your army. Units shoot through each other, artillery fires canister shot right into your man with no friendly fire and cav is totally useless.

In this game, you can play the campaign or historical battles. Historical battles place you in command of the army of your choosing during the more well known battles of the ACW. You are given objectives and troops that are similar to that used in real life. The campaign is the real draw here: You create your general and are given command of the army of your choosing. You fight a starter battle, then are given a handful of units, and you are supposed take your army to victory. Doing so requires that you resupply and equip your troops before each fight using resources obtained. You get to choose how large your units are, who commands them, and what they are equipped with. There is no campaign map - it's just a campaign menu, but It's very compelling. You are then asked to take these units into the well-known battles of the ACW and achieve victory. 

Battles play out similarly to Total War battles, if you are familiar with those games. Individual units or groups of units (i.e., brigades in the parlance) can be given commands in real time, and they will follow them to the best of their ability. Moral plays a big role, as brigades rarely fight to the last man. Again, very compelling stuff here. The AI will keep you on your toes in several of the battles.

In the campaign, winning or losing battles results in the gain or loss of political power. You can use political power to buy weapons, generals, recruits, etc. However, if your political power falls too low, you lose the campaign (i.e., the president of either the CSA or USA fires you). Again, it's all compelling - do you spend political power to help your troops, or do you save it in case you start losing battles?

Sadly, in this game, your main enemy isn't the Confederate or the Union. It's really: The clock!

Fans of this 'timer' say it keeps the game more challenging. I personally side with the other camp and think that, on a game that is so realistic and slow-paced, this very tight timer set for each battles forces us to neglect the strategic aspects, and way too often just run and charge the enemies like chicken with no heads (or cavalry with no horses I should say!)

It's sad because the solution is very easy: Like the Total War series and so many similar successful games, why not just making it optional?! How can that bother them, or the community in general, if I prefer a slower and more realistic pace with no time limit, when I play offline and all by myself?!!

But outside of this much debated issue, which definitely causes me to play it much less than I normally would, the game is otherwise fantastic! 

It runs well without any issues. Graphics are great. Sounds are very realistic. And trust me, those 'puffs' of smoke coming out of the guns of an entire division when they fire (and the corresponding enemy units falling in front of them) during each salvo....are borderline 'orgasmic'! ;)

A very rare and unique masterpiece, both for the genre and the historical era! And as such, very easy to recommend!

My problems with the game? Merging brigades through the army management screen is not possible. Considering the cost of recruiting veterans to depleted brigades, this is very problematic.

Secondly, and one of the biggest impacts, when mass moving units the pathing behaviour is bonkers. Instead of assigning the closest unit to the new line, your units will criss cross and show their flanks to enemies. This forces you to move one or two units at a time. When you are commiting to line actions with 15+ Infantry brigades this means a whole load of micro on battlefields that are huge.

Some annoying gameplay issues. Your General & Supply cart might move away from an order position randomly, which will then put your troops at a disadvantage. Cavalry was traditionally used as a shock troop, skirmisher, or enforce the routing to ensure battle is won, but cavalry in this game is terrible. Sometime they charge and sometime they don't, sometime they shoot and sometime they don't, they feel sluggish and when engaged in battle it is easy for flanking units to break the cavalry even, thou it is not realist the enemy flanking troop will shoot into their own troop engaging the cavalry. Friendly fire?  
Cannon, why do cannons even exist, they are useless? No shock value, kill ration is terrible and any unit vs a cannon unit will win. So no benefit in making use of cannons, none. 
The game seems more frustrating than anything else, which in a real war situation is true as war is frustrating, but I want to enjoy my game.
One never seems to be able to get an upper hand. You buy more troops, the opposition matches you, you buy better equipment the opposition matches you. What is the point as the small subtle changes should give a small advantage, but it just gets matched.

Really good RTS style battles with just enough after battle army management (building/equipping/recruiting/training) to give you a sense that you're not playing a scripted series of battles, adn that your building and shaping the army as you go through the campaign.

When you recruit a new brigade, give it a name, fight it through a half dozen battles over 10+ hrs, replenish it from your limited supply of veterans, give it your best weapons from your measly supply of guns, and finally see it progress to elite status - only to see it cut to pieces by grapeshot in 10 seconds after you charge it headlong into a battery of enemy artillery because you need to take the point their sitting on before the clock runs out ... well it was a fairly emotional experience which i'll need a bereavement counselor to help me get over",1606517864,1606517864,True,12,6,0.670000255107879639,0,True,False,False

The things that are great:
- Persistent army - kinda like in Homeworld series your army remains and get veterancy across the campaign.
- Huge range of historic weapons to choose.
- Logistic and economy of your army.
- AI is very COMPETENT - what I mean? usually game have dumb AI that has 10:1 advantage to have chance with player, or the AI is cheating, all knowing. Here the AI PLAY LIKE HUMAN - play well, try to counter flanking, but also makes some msitake that you can exploit. Simply the AI is fum to play against.
- nice spit between side-battles and major battles.
- multi-phase huge major battles - example: phase 1 - you fight on left flank, phase 2 you fight in the center, phase 3 you fight on right flank, phase 4 you merge all into one huge battle, phase 5 you need to push/retreat to final point.
- ""reputation points"" which can buy you favors (new equipment, officers, cash, recruits).
- Union campaign is fun and Confederate campaign is a bit more challenge (but still within resonable and fun level).

There are some cons:
- there is almost no ""persistent army"" on enemy side - you can obliterate entire armies during battle, but enemy will aways get fresh and veteran troops next battle.
- many of weapons are in such small amounts that you barely can equip one brigade with them.
- you don't really know how many phases/days each major battle takes.
- veterans cost waaaaay to much.
- oficers die to easily and it's pure RNG, to the ponint you could easily lack officets to recruit when you have full 5 corps.
- there is no indication that you will loose surplus reputation points when you get above 100.

Now for the long story:

As a person who loves  intricate, well-designed strategy games and also has a childhood interest in Civil War history, it is incredibly rewarding to find a game which successfully combines those two passions. Typically, most attempts to bring the Civil War into the video game industry always seems difficult, either because the game is developed primarily by historians who are not familiar with game design, or because the Civil War itself is such a niche market, rather than broader stroke themes such as in TW Empire, or EU4, which allow you to play as numerous nations throughout a time perioud spanning centuries.

Luckily Ultimate General, in my opinion, killed it with this title. It has all the Civil War aesthetic to immerse you in the 1860s but also an incredibly intelligent and innovative AI that truly makes defeating your enemy feel like an accomplishment (cavalry dont just conveniently charge straight towards your cannon so you can blast them away with cannister shot like in TW Empire, as fun as that is). In other words, as the title suggests, by the end of each major battle, you feel like an actual general, unleashing your inner bloodthirsty Grant by using your infantry as disposable cannon fodder to overwhelm your enemy, or your inner tactical Lee by setting up clever ambushes on good ground and flanking your enemy at the right time. 

Every terrain in the game makes a difference, from having your regiments hide out in a copse of trees, hunker down behind stone walls, or even just take up position at the crest of a steep hill. Flanking and outmaneuvering your opponent is also more important than in other games. You should always attempt to surround your opponent if possible but need to be cautious not to leave your own flank exposed. Just like many real battles from then, things can quickly to hell because you decide to maybe counter attack a weak enemy only to find out they had more reinforcements hiding out on the other side of the field. 

Outside of combat, the game also presents an engaging army management feature that doesn't break immersion by feeling to game-ish. Rather than unlocking better units or upgrades thru research like Civ or TW, you can to purchase or capture improved weaponry or use your reputation, earned by success in battle, to get better rifles and supplies for your men. Also, instead of ""leveling up"" your units, you can can choose to assign certain officers who have distinguished themselves on the field to lead various regiments (something that you will find incredibly common in Civil War history and politics). For instance, in real life, Lee was only as successful as he was because he delegated command to men he knew he could give generic orders to, and then they would in turn take care of the minute details on the battlefield. In contrast, the Union struggled through much of the early stages of the war because many of the officers were appointed by political favor, often times being politicians themselves rather than West Point grads, and thus knew nothing about how to handle an army. Every officer is a little different and will improve or degrade your units strengths accordingly. 

There's a lot more I could nitpick, but this is a far too  long review anyway. Again, the main takeaway is that this is not only a good Civil War video game, but an honestly fun and immersive strategy game that feels a tad more mature and realistic than some of the others I've played. I highly recommend, at least when you get tired of the cinematic carnage of Total War of the constant expansion of Civ",1605389801,1605389801,True,24,0,0.726882338523864746,0,True,False,False

502520,79211091,76561197974845494,0,7,9113,0,3556,1705796346,"I want this review to be VERY CLEAR.  I have owned this game for years now, but only really coming to enjoy it now.  I think that I may have been in the mood for a ""quick fix"" back when I first picked this up, and never really gave all of the mechanics a chance.  

This game is BRILLIANT.  You will see negative reviews saying, ""AI Overpowered"", ""Veterancy Broken"", ""Cavalry Useless"".  In my opinion, if you take your time with this game, really think about what things would have been like, and play accordingly, this game's mechanics are SPOT ON.  

EXAMPLE: Civil War Cavalry - (taken from wiki) - There were four types of mounted forces prevalent in the Civil War. Cavalry were forces that fought principally on horseback, armed with carbines, pistols, and sabers. ... In the second half of the war, most of the units considered to be cavalry actually fought battles using the tactics of mounted infantry. - The word ""vidette"", as in Vidette Cavalry, comes from Romance Languge (French/Italian) vedetta which is associated with and outlook or sentinel.  You cannot use all Cavalry as Shock troops.

THAT SAID, you can do things to ""SPECIALIZE"" your troops. Outfit your 750 man Cavalry Brigade with some Carbines that have a range of 300 or more - NOW YOU HAVE MOUNTED INFANTRY.  Their starting carbines are sort of useless, but HEY, THAT'S HOW THINGS WERE!!!

 - ""I'M ALWAYS OUTNUMBERED"" - HEY NUMBNUTS, EVER HEARD OF A MILITIA? Ever notice those extra 15 THOUSAND  RE-BORED FARMER RIFLES and your extra 12 THOUSAND MANPOOL? Throw some ROOKIES on the field! THESE ARMIES WERE NOT COMPRISED OF BATTLE-HARDENED TROOPS. Most of them were freshies, conscripts, and green volunteers.  Only later on did you have experienced troops.  I am fielding several ""State Militia"" units headed by lowly Majors.  They work!!

 - USE ARTILLERY PROPERLY - PAY ATTENTION TO RANGE.  At close range, a howitzers and smoothbore cannons turn into GIANT SHOTGUNS.  Crossing a bridge? BRING A CANNON!!  Assaulting the woods? BRING A CANNON!! Holding a Chokepoint? CHOKE THEM WITH THE CANNON STUFF IT DOWN THEIR THROATS!!! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHAWWWWWWW! You get what I'm saying? Good.

- Keep your boiz in COVER!!!  Don't send them out into the slaughter unless you HAVE TO

- the ""F"" Key can be used to ""FALLBACK"" in case a unit is taking heavy fire.  DO NOT MOVE THEM OR TURN THEM to retreat.  PRESS F!!!!! They will back away from the enemy WITHOUT TURNING THEIR BACKS. They will not be ""FLANKED"", lose morale, and ROUT from the fight.

There are so many little nuances that it's hard to write everything down.  I've been sitting here typing for 10 minutes now, but I'm just hoping that you get the idea, and maybe give UGCW another chance if, by chance, you lost interest.

It has an extremely high difficulty curve, but once you pass the first hill, it's smooth sailing. In-battle movement is fun and the pause option gives you a moment to really calculate your options before committing your men. That said, it can be very frustrating when units stop responding or just won't fire their weapons. You can have great positioning, but sometime your people won't fire.

Where Ultimate General: CW goes above and beyond Ultimate General: Gettysburg is in the army management. You create your own corps, regiments, detachments, the works. You choose their weapons, their training, and give them stats that will impact the longterm cost of your war. It's excellent at elevating the core gameplay to the next level, but comes with a big drawback. Mid-way through the campaign, you can find yourself in a hole where you either have the wrong units or not enough money to buy new units. It requires a lot of advanced planning to get your army ""just so."" 

Ultimate General: Civil War is simple. You line up a colored group of numbers and watch the other numbers go down. But the sound design, especially the power of the cannons, makes it extremely satisfying to trick the 3,000-strong Confederate regiment into the riverbed and then hit them with 50 cannons of canister that knocks them down to 1,300 men in 5 minutes.

Battles in Total War, the closest mainstream alternative, can have fewer men than a single unit in this game, and with it comes some educational merit. ""Why didn't they just flank around rather than fight in lines?"" some people ask. Well, you can try it here, and you will quickly see it's impossible because the armies are so large.

Replay-ability comes from building your army differently, and seeing how it handles different scenarios. There are multiple viable strategies in army composition that can beat the campaigns. Sadly, this freedom is squashed substantially on the highest difficulty, Legendary, which artificially increases difficulty by giving the AI super soldiers, the best weapons to equip them, and by outnumbering the player on top of that. It basically forces you to go with a quality over quantity build.

Weapon balance is a bit wonky, with muzzle loader rifles being better than even repeaters in infantry, (the most common unit,) despite being far more expensive. Fortifications are weird, as the efficiency hit on fortified Infantry sometimes makes them more effective fighting out of them than in, which is just plain silly. There was more to defense than standing in a treeline, but that seems to be the extent of this game's imagination.

Overall, it's a good game, but switching to the J&P Rebalance Mod is highly advised. At the very least, you should use the UI and AI Customization mod, which serves essentially as an unofficial patch for the base game; making the experience far better.",1603739467,1603739467,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This isn't a total war game. Yes there's a campaign, but it doesn't really matter what you do, you'll always be constrained by the scenario. 
If you assign your first corps to an attack, you MIGHT get to use the entire 1st corps, or you might only get a few divisions, and the game doesn't really tell you this. 
Moreover, if you crush the enemy force in a battle (dealing huge numbers of casualties,) don't expect that to be reflected in the following battles. The enemy will always outnumber you, no matter what you do. 

So, while the gameplay is very fun and I do recommend it, I lost a lot of the potential fun when I realized that I'll never actually get to have a battle where all my preparation and would be size superiority lets me crush my smaller enemy force. 
Late game you are ALWAYS placed against a larger force, no matter what, and often times they're entrenched and you have to attack THEM.

This is an [i] incredible [/i] strategy game.

With most RTS games I get bogged down in the minutiae of managing 2000+ individuals separated in about 20 units, give or take, but where UG: Civil War really shines is with its easy-to-manage units. The controls are intuitive, allowing for less micromanagement and more time trying to attrit the enemy into suing for peace.

Another laudable feature is the AI, which is more intelligent than many other RTS games and will make you pay a steep price in blood for attacking fortified positions while also (mostly) focusing its attacks on where it deems your defense to be weakest. 

UG: Civil War strikes the perfect balance between too much realism (i.e. having a delay in unit reaction time b/c a system of flags has to signal them or a man on horseback has to deliver their next orders, or having your green units route when adjacent units break) and not enough realism.

I often sit dazed at the human cost after what started as a minor engagement. Other times I am shocked that the AI miscalculated and took such severe losses against an entrenched position. But that was the real Civil War, rife with miscalculation on both sides that resulted in over a million casualties. 

That's a [i] river [/i] of blood.

Stresses me the hell out (but in a fun, satisfying way)
Can get a little monotonous in the smaller battles
Some small features missing
  - Can't mix weapon types in brigades
  - Can't equip divisions as a group
  - Difficult to manage brigades as a division together in battle
  - Can't apply medicine to wounded leaders (How long is he out?)
  - Can't give ""best route"" destination orders, troops march in a straight line
No updates in almost 3 years??

Overall I really enjoy this game.  As you can see, I've played it for many hours on different difficulties and with both sides through the campaign.  I haven't spent too much time on the historical battles because there's no personal investment like in the campaign where you build and equip your army and watch your officers develop.

The Greats- This game does a great job letting you build out an army and play out historical battles on incredible looking maps. The various difficulties and ability to choose whether to fight minor battles also allows for greater flexibility and speed. I love that you can retain your troops and improve their experience and skills and that it makes such a tremendous impact in the ongoing campaign. The mechanics of the actual battles work very well too- if you flank someone it hurts, if you can an overwhelming attack units can start to panic. Great overall game play.

The Good- The reinforcement and morale points system is a good modifier- you can request additional troops, funds, or equipment, but it comes at a cost of overall reputation and morale, and if that dips too low and you lose a battle- that's the game folks! 

The Opportunities- I want to be careful not to call this ""The Bad"" because I don't actually think there's anything bad about this game, but there are ways to improve. This is solely a tactical game- you fight from one historical battle to the next until the end of the war- with the exception being the ""what if"" campaign around storming Washington D.C. if you've made it that far as the Confederates. In an ideal world some strategic component allowing you to redirect away from some historical battles would be excellent. Also in their later games you can take artillery and then use it in the same battle, whereas here you can only take it and set it up in the next battle- would be awesome to turn those Napoleons you just took on the enemy.

For all of that this game comes with a high recommendation from me. The developers are superb and continue to push out great material- but this one will remain my favorite from them. The only potential usurper might be the new Grand Tactician: Civil War game- we'll see how that one comes out.

- Each Regiment/Division is equipped with musketry of your choosing, and offers dynamic bonuses based
on historical data of those particular weapons and their availability during the Civil War. You can also customize these divisions and name them, which makes you feel attached to them. 

- Supplies are necessary. Every battle depends on your ability to bring ammunition to certain parts of the battle. I don't know how many times I have not had adequate munitions, and have been forced to cede a part of the battlefield in the early game.  

- Terrain is key and plays a major role in your ability to advance larger units of troops to certain
areas of the battlefield. Having troops under cover of a wood line, or in a wheat field can have different results in firefights. 

This game truly fills a void that most games do not. It is a little more in depth than most strategy games that are mission based, and it really makes you feel in control of your army.

That being said, the campaign mode is wildly inaccurate from a historical point of view.

Given the significance of the battle, and the overwhelming losses the Confederates took that day, it should have ended the whole damn war. There would have been no logical recovery for the Confederacy after that in any historical sense. I basically obliterated their whole army.

To start off with, the tactical combat in this game is pretty good. The units move much more smoothly and reliably than in UG Gettysburg, and I feel the weapons effectiveness of the game strikes a good balance of making assualts difficult and costly, but not impossible, even against superior numbers. There are a few questionable factors; for one, while I understand the necessity of making combined arms defenses possible, allowing artillery to fire cannister shot directly through friendly lines seems rather gamey, and while better than most RTS game AI, the AI in this game is hardly brilliant. Overall, though, the tactical combat is clearly well thought out, and will serve as a good foundation for future Ultimate General games.

The strategic aspects of this game are its main failing. First, though perhaps a minor point, I would like to note that the reinforcement system in the game generally leads players to prioritize rebuilding weakened brigades, rather than forming new ones, as was generally the approach taken during the actual Civil War. The main fundamental flaw, however, is that the campaign is essentially a series of historical scenarios, which, aside from manpower, do not change with respect to prior divergences from the historical sequence of events. If, as the union, you win the first battle of Bull Run, you still have to fight through to 1865 to capture Richmond. The game also fails in historical accuracy and interest by compensating for its insufficient AI by simply giving it three times as many troops after each battle as the player gets. This means that aside from complete encirclements, players' prior victories have a minimal effect on the enemy forces in the next battle.

To summarize, the basic battle system of the game is very good, and the historical battles are quite fun, but the strategic campaign mechanics need to be completely reworked to provide either particularly interesting, or historically accurate gameplay.",1520479297,1596251514,True,18,0,0.709220409393310547,0,True,False,False

In total war armies quickly become colorful specks for you to use in battle. However, in ultimate general, you have full control. You have complete customization on your army. How many men are in a unit, what equipment they use, even their commanding officers. This truly makes the army feel like yours. That's not some random unit you sacrificed for the greater good.

After getting interested in the history of warfare I've become more and more dissatisfied by the Total War series. This games and Field of Glory 2 are likely the best relatively accessible games that try to show the reality of battle.

personal Pros: 
- the art style does a good job of giving an idea of the size of a battle and the simple design of terrain and units give you all the information you need at a glance
- the progression of building your army while progressing through your military career is neither too quick or slow. The progression is at a spot where you are not frustrated but truly feel that your more experienced and later veteran units have worth making you feel every casualty taken and really getting you to think about how to use them.

personal negatives:
- due to the battles being set instead of there being a sandbox campaign (like in Total War or Mount and Blade) there is some battles that are overly scripted with what is expected of you and what the enemy throws at you resulting in huge difficulty spikes. I often restarted battles until I was satisfied with my performance. (I have to add that the style the campaign is done with aka you doing historical battles in their historical order, between every large battle you can choose to do a small amount of smaller battles in a non set order, is absolutely not a negative especially considering that the budget of the game would've likely never allowed anything else)
- the game is still a video game and as a result has some odd things in battle, one example is that having two 1000 man units against one 1000 man unit in melee will do more damage than fighting that unit with one 2500 man unit

overall a great game with some faults some of which are ironed out by the J&P Rebalance Mod which I would highly recommend

But the Campaing Battles can be absolute H*rseshit. At the Battle of Shilo (Confederate), I fought hard and captured Pittsburg Landing on the first day, expending all my ammunition. Only for the Game to proceed to the second day, setting all my troops back in front of the union defenses, [i] giving the Landing back to the enemy, [/i] and telling me that I should capture it [u]again[/u]. With no replenishment of ammo, with weakend troops, against an entrenched enemy who was just given back his strong defensive position. And that is just absolute b*llshit. I fullfilled all Victory Requirements, routed the Union, and was told to go f*ck myself and do it again. 
EDIT: So it turns out that proceeding to the next day of Shilo despite having captured the Landing is a well known Bug, which oddly still hasn't been fixed, which is too bad. But now, I can finally fully recommend this game. Just remember to save whenever you can during battles, it can save you a lot of trouble and time.

About a year later and I started a Johnny Reb playthrough, though it pained the Patriot inside me, I pretended I was doing an alternate history in my head.

     One review I read mentioned the complaint of the enemy unrealistically replenishing troops. Yeah you kinda have to have that because once you start rolling the enemy, if they didn't unrealistically replenish the game would lose it's fun factor as you stomp all over them..it is a game afterall. But still, I reached a point in both campaigns the AI struggled to keep up with my numbers and, for the Rebs, about the Battle of Malvern Hill, I had an entire Corps that barely saw combat because I used them as a flanking maneuver and crushed the Union forces completely, encircling them as if I was Hannibal at the Battle of Cannae.

      Reference to the review that mentioned the timed events, I am okay with it because some of the battles I ran out of time, but continued on and once I captured the objective uncontested, it still gave me a victory.

      Reference to the Battle of Shiloh, I kinda expected something like that so I didn't push my troops too hard to capture the point, but towards the end of the timer, I set my forces up for an assault for the next day. Which, I resoundly sent Grant back North.

Cons:

- no tutorial:  new players need to know how to play.  I had a vague idea from their previous entry but a new player will be lost.

- Unit commands are extremely lacking and need work.  If you need an example devs look at the Total War series.  I can arrange my units how I want.  What is really bad is having infantry fire all at once 4 ranks deep.

- No options to change what kind of shot my artillery is firing.  This is a must in this game and especially during this era.  I want to select grape shot when the enemy is up close and personal!

- Positioning troops is very lackluster.  There are numerous formations that were used in the Civil War.   I also want to be able to stretch my line to cover more ground.  If that is an option I was not able to find it since there was no tutorial.

- Cavalry has one option charge.  There is not option to dismount and fire.  Which makes a huge difference in a battle.  

- Defensive features and entrenchment needed a lot of work.  If I am defending a position and holding it the entrenchment value needs to increase.  Also, let me determine how to deploy defenses in the battle setup screen.

Pros:

- Beautiful artwork.

- The traits are very useful and could be even better with a tutorial that explains them in depth.

- Overall the details of the weapons were nice and you could purchase them if you wanted from dealers.

Overall, I can't recommend this game.  It needs a tutorial to make it complete and work for all players, new and old.

More often than not it falls in the former. The enemy is overwhelmingly numerous. They have weird and inconsistent stats that completely dwarf those of your men. They follow scripted paths and there is no real rhyme or reason to the side missions as they impart literally no benefit to you, besides experience. Units are fickle and will barely listen to you, decide to retreat randomly despite no moral problems and there seem to be multiple issues with cavalry involving them not firing revolvers, taking huge casualties in melee against advantageous targets like artillery. On top of all that, the actual combat mechanics are a bit wonky with the battles lasting so long not a single unit has enough stamina to actually last the entire battle or where you are encouraged to shoot into your own melee for extra devastating kills and magically you miss your own men. Meanwhile the AI seems to just constantly get THOUSANDS of fresh reinforcements all the while your same army corpse is taking constant attrition and not a single inflicted casualty seems to stick on the enemy.

Some battles are so lopsided, to the point of ridiculous parody where the numbers are entirely off from the real battle, As for example the battle of Shiloh where in the campaign the enemy has nearly 20'000 more men than you whilst you are fighting on the union side DESPITE the exact opposite being true about the real battle. It just all feels wrong like there is someone behind the scenes making sure every battle is an utter close call with huge casualties even when it's not required. But then the AI is just utterly helpless when you learn the script and manipulate it into performing the actions you want like charging your infantry line with loaded canon behind it or skipping through parts of a battle by intentionally losing to save on ammo and manpower that you can use in the final stand in a better tactical position.

All in all I just can't recommend it. It seems to have way too many problems for it to be a proper RTS and there just isn't any fun to be had when you constantly have to take a peek behind the curtain just to curtail the constant finger on the scale trying to give you a challenge with battalions TWICE your size. And once you peak behind the curtain the famous charge on the Cemetery ridge at Gettysburg morphs into a pathetic 3 battalion charge because you completely murdered the whole opposing army.",1592789013,1593947767,False,5,0,0.547471165657043457,0,True,False,False

Interesting tradeoffs in developing army in between battles.  Pretty good battlefied AI, especially compared with other games I've played in this genre.  Challenging even on easier/mid levels, without feeling ""stupid hard"" with illogical AI advantages on hardest level. 
 There's ways to beat every battle, at any level, without resorting to gamey exploits...but that doesn't mean it'll be easy or cheap.  As is appropriate to the subject matter.

Worth mentioning:  there is a ""campaign"" between battles, but that portion of gameplay is confined to building/training/equipping the army in camp.  There is no campaign map with maneuvers carried out on the strategic/operational levels.  The campaign is a fixed series of battles all the way through 1865; winning a crushing, ostensibly war-ending victory at, say, Antietam or Gettysburg doesn't end or otherwise shorten the course of the war (although it can reduce enemy's manpower, resources, and morale in future battles).

Overall, I'd probably give UGCW a 7.5/10 overall, but easily 9/10 in its genre (my primary comparison being the similar Total War titles, specifically Empire & Napoleon...with the aforementioned caveat that the comparison is restricted to battlefield play only, as ETW/NTW have a campaign strategic aspect whereas UGCW does not).",1593612891,1593612891,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you have played through Gettysburg and want more this *might* scratch that itch. It does for me but just barely. If you have yet to play either game I would recommend Gettysburg over Civil War. While Civil War does have more battles and a campaign mode but are lacking.

- Battles: The focus on the entire Civil War in this game means that each battle has far fewer unique ""what-ifs"" and the AI also seems much less able to put up a good challenge.

- Campaign: is essentially a linear stitching of battles together and the AI receives massive amounts of scaling which while keeping things interesting largely defeats the purpose of leading an Army.

The combination of RPG with RTS is a nice touch from the development team. The RPG mechanic involves the management of your character or your army and allows you to apply bonuses through the Careers tab. Each selection can drastically alter the trajectory of your armies success and can affect the long term outlook for how your army engages the enemy.

Not that it is perfect of course (seriously developer that one voice yelling ""sir yes sir"" in the camp screen absolutely pierces my eardrums every time), but I absolutely love the concept.  I am a big fan of the total war series (especially empire/napoleon hint hint), and although this is missing the depth of a TW campaign, it has even more customization of your units in many ways.   

You control your units weapons, either purchasing them with money won through battle rewards or scavenging your own fallen soldiers weapons as well as the enemies.  If you do give it a try, don't put it down after losing the first battle once or twice.  I did, thinking it was not for me, and then picked it up a week later and havent put it down since.  

Hint for strategy, flanking is the key to winning (as always in these games).  However this game does routing/broken units a bit different.  When a unit breaks, you can't give orders to it until it recovers, but they will still be fighting and shooting a bit.  They just do not fire a coherent volley or maintain a formation.  There seems to be different levels of routing, where sometimes the unit breaks and scatters away from the enemy, and other times are almost in a formation but each individual is firing at their own pace, albeit much slower than the standard volleys.  They also recover from routing much easier, meaning when your center breaks, you need to have a reserve to plug it, but then you can shift the broken unit into your reserve to plug another hole or to send around for a flank attack.  Units break pretty often, but I pretty much always see what I did wrong to cause it. 

One result of this is that cavalry gets eaten alive pretty often, having them mop up routing units only works if the unit has extremely weak melee, eg cannons, otherwise your cavalry dies too fast to clear a large/full unit that broke from a well timed volley into their rear flank.

In response to the review that mentions the campaign following the pre timed events and ignoring what is going on, I do not see it as actually causing a problem.  Sometime the text that pops up during these does not make sense with the battle, but it does not actually affect the flow of the battle when that happens.   I mean, the battle is affected by reinforcements arriving on both sides at different times, but its not like you have to all of a sudden retreat for no reason if you are winning.  Just destroy the enemy as you see fit as long as you accomplish the mission, and you can ignore the text.

With 2 star generals leading small platoons personally at times. You cannot even utilize your entire army & it seriously detracts from the game making it almost pointless to get a major victory because the next battle you can't even use all the men.

It pretty much plays the same as Gettysburg but with enhanced graphics and customization of your units in the campaign which covers the entire war. Fight large battles consisting of tens of thousands of men, often into the hundred thousand range. Although there is no strategic campaign against the AI, it will fight well during battles and attempt flanking maneuvers or focus its' army on your weakest areas. This game is mostly fun, but you will also come across frequent senseless mechanics that I will address below. 

Graphics: It's a nice looking game that's not going to win any ""wow"" factors. That doesn't mean it's bad, but it doesn't focus on graphics. The game focuses on actual gameplay, and I have zero complaints about it. You can zoom in fairly close to the combat, but not eye level like Total War games. Ultimately, the game looks nice, but by no means will tax your system.

Sound: Crank the volume and you have a full on war going on. Sounds are crisp and clean, muskets have good cracks and cannons provide a great bass roar. The music is also good. Nothing extensive, but fitting for the game.

Gameplay: Take command of the Northern army or Southern army and fight well known battles and many lesser known battles. As you progress as a general, you'll be able to customize your armies with the number of men you want, the weapons they use, and commander abilities to further enhance the regiments such as improved accuracy or melee ability. Since it's an American Civil War game, most combat will be done at range, but if you time your charges correctly, you can do serious damage. But that's where problems creep in. 

The AI can be wonderful at times, and absolute trash at times. The AI is able to charge its' armies across the entire map without penalty, covering large spaces in a short time. Then they'll hit you in melee and possibly route your armies. Anytime a unit is near a charging army, they will reorient themselves to face the direction, even if they are getting shot by other regiments or multiple units are between them and the charging group. And the melee mechanics are quite wonky.

I've charged 2,500 men into a group of 200 men and I didn't kill them. They routed, but they didn't die. 10:1 odds, and they didn't die. And this will happen frequently. I've charged 1,200 cavalry into a group of skirmishers in the open. Despite being armed with sabers, it took the cavalry more than 30 in-game minutes before the skirmishers were completely routed.

And that's lucky too, because cavalry and skirmishers are some of the most finicky units to try and control. The moment cavalry see enemy units they run the opposite direction. Click to engage and they'll sit there. Double click to charge and they'll move in close and suddenly run away. Skirmishers will act similarly. Instead of skirmishing with the enemy, they'll sit just out of range so they're not firing. Click to engage they move up, fire once, and run away. They refuse to actively engage the enemy. Many times, I can't even get them to fire unless I give them a move order, then they'll fire without issue. Same applies when you recruit actually light infantry with long range weapons. Many times I've had the enemy engage the light infantry and they won't even return fire until I tell them to move, then they start shooting.

The objectives to win/lose a battle are very straight forward. But the objectives you actually need to achieve to win the battle can be hard to decipher. As a defender, did you hold 12 of the 13 objectives? Congrats! You lost. As an attacker, did you capture 1 of the 7 objectives? Congrats! You won! Be prepared to fight 2 hour (real life) battles and then lose because of a single objective despite wiping the board on each other objectives.

If you plated Ultimate General Gettysburg, you'll be more disappointed with the tactical combat of this game. The maps do not have the topography information so you can't actually see elevation bonuses as easily on maps with rolling hills.

Conclusion: Overall, the game is pretty fun and the battles can be quite intense. The AI does a good job probing your weak points and then breaking through. The escalation of battles is very enjoyable as it keeps getting bigger and bigger.

502520,55014958,76561198078879823,0,8,73358,0,4587,1697253979,"Having played this game in detail, I have give an honest opinion. First off, good game over all. For me it was highly addictive and gave me a great sense of nostalgia playing Sid Meier's: Gettysburg and Antietam and General Lee: Civil War 1 and 2. This game seems to be a hybrid of the two, the real time movement and engagement of troops on the battlefield of the former coupled with the stats and economics of the latter. In fact, some of the weapons mentioned in this game, the Farmers and re-bored Farmers muskets (perhaps 1812 Springfields before and after conversion from flintlocks) brought me back to my General Lee: Civil War days.

Pros: As the game progresses you can expand your army; creating corps, divisions, brigades with infantry, cavalry, artillery and skirmishers that you can name your way, appoint commanders, and outfit with special weapons.

As you win battles you earn points towards your general that you can buff certain stats-earning more money from battles, cheaper and more replacements, more ammunition for your troops in battle, healing wounded so you get men back, and recon that gives enemy stats. I like this last perk. At its max it will tell the exact number of enemy troops I face, though it doesn't give locations. The ratio bar fluctuates when units are lost or reinforcements arrive, thereby warning me a counterattack is coming.

Many smaller or lesser known battles are represented; Philippi, Iuka, the Siege of Suffolk to name a few. My favorite is Fort Stevens. Another plus, the developers did their homework as they marked specific units participating in the battle like regiments of the Veterans Reserve Corps (Invalid Corps). Though the one drawback, the unit sprites don't reflect their special uniforms, sky blue with dark blue trim blouse and dark blue forage caps.

One of my favorite parts of this game, the harvesting of discarded weapons. After each battle you're given a list of items that your men either recovered or captured. During the Siege of Suffolk, I bagged 27 artillery pieces and just less than 3,000 stands of arms. Those weapons are now in my inventory to equip my units. As was the case in Fredericksburg-I captured 2,714 Pattern 1853 Enfield rifled-muskets (cause I wrote it down) that I re-quipped one of my new brigades originally with 1842 Springfield smoothbores. So it makes equipping units somewhat easier, granted you'll have to save your pennies to buy enough repeaters.

Another plus, when you win battles you earn favor points from Richmond/Washington that cap at 100. If you force a draw or loss a battle, you lose favor. If it drops to zero the game ends. You can use those points in exchange for favors, extra cash, replacements, or special weapons like some 20lb Parrott rifles, Sharps rifles, Spencer repeaters, or target rifles-to name a few. The more points you earn also gives a morale buff to your units.

Any prisoners taken in battle are 'exchanged' automatically after each battle and you're given free replacements for this exchange. It's on a 1:1 ratio, but it's capped at 1,000 for you. At Gettysburg I bagged 4,630 prisoners, yet gained only 1,000 replacements.

Another plus, the types of weapons used do make a difference. Again the developers did their homework. Gaines Mill, one of my units was engaging a rebel brigade at distance of 100 or so yards in the open with 1842 Springfields and dropping maybe 3 or so men per volley. To assist, a brigade with 1855 Springfield rifled-muskets moved alongside and fired a single volley at the same distance, dropping 40-50 men at once. When I closed the distance to within 50 or less yards, my smoothbores were dropping men like flies. So, props to the developers for understanding what rifling can do.

Cons. The AI is good, but not perfect. Units normally react on their own if attacked so you don't have babysit every unit. However, there were many instances where the AI behaved strangely or glitched. Chancellorsville, rebel wagons rolled right up to my lines as if teasing me to get them. I ran forward and captured three wagon trains without firing a shot. Rebel cavalry also suicide charge solid lines of infantry, either in the open or behind breastworks and are wiped out in a single volley. Enemy infantry do that as well, repeated attacks fail and units are whittled down to 300 or fewer men, yet they come right back expecting it to change. I've also routed enemy units and they, somehow, thread through my line of troops, sometimes several lines, and reform behind me and continue fighting.

The field captures are not consistent. In many battles I virtually wiped out the enemy, yet the weapons gathered are around 1/3 of the number of enemy units on the field-most times they're 1842 Palmetto/Springfields, not real useful by 1864. Same for artillery.

There are quite a few glitches; I've seen some infantry run faster than horses. Once, rebel cavalry became immortal at Fort Stevens. Sometimes units will just stand there under fire and not react, forcing me to remind them to fire. This doesn't always work as I get a 'Blocked' icon even though there are no obstructions between them and their target. Also, the fortifications are a problem. The enemy has to be in a certain position before your troops will engage. Sometimes the enemy firing on me in the open is cutting down more of my guys behind earthworks.

Another complaint, that appears to be common; the strict script. I would agree, in hindsight, this is a big problem. Regardless of your progress one day, when the time runs out you're going to be moved to a new location against your will. At Stones River, I went off-script and launched a counter attack had the rebels almost completely destroyed when the time ran out. 'We're being overrun!' the game would say and then my entire command would be moved behind fortifications. The rebels were so badly damaged after that attack that they made no effort to attack the next day, but had I not been hindered by the script, I would've ended it right there with a total victory.

My last big complaint; no multiplayer. I would love to play a joint-campaign with my friends or face them.

You get some captured messages where enemy officers complain how your efforts bested them. One even called me their 'nemesis' which made me chuckle. They soon repeat themselves. One officer complained four times that he feared being replaced and asked his friend to pull strings to save his position. You'd think after two failures the answer would be-No.

Many maps are also reused for different battles.

The last real complaint is the ending; there's an epilogue; I became governor of New York and heralded with parades so force, but it's just a card and not some you visualize. There's just a period print from a Harper's Weekly of a guy shaking hands. Nothing overwhelming. It would be nice to have a cut-scene where troops are passing in review as you watch with pride, and there was much rejoicing.

This game can be vastly improved upon; cut-scenes, perhaps showing your opponents angry at you besting them. Your men in camp celebrating, and showing the average life of a soldier. Your staff can be your in-game adviser, show the horrors of the battlefield, visiting hospitals so that it gives emotional weight when using the game sprites.

Also, give more choice and allow your actions in one battle influence another and not be hindered by the script.

Include smaller details; oversee court-martials, prisoners exchanges, send scouts to gather intel, and also show captured enemy flags. I'm always eager to capture an enemy flag. Since we can already create units, why not go one further and allow full customization, get Militia, Zouaves, United States Colored Troops, Invalid Corps, and more! 

All in all, a good game and I'll continue playing it. I hope that the developers heed our word and continue to improve or make a sequel. Here's hoping.",1567931487,1592265273,True,35,0,0.807074666023254395,0,True,False,False

The campaign overhaul is an amazing idea, and I vastly prefer the idea of a dynamic historical campaign then a shallow experience like Total War where a lot of important things are glossed over and you get the same generic map, same generic siege battle, and it feels like a game.

But, UG:CW is different. It feels like you are actually fighting an incredibly tense civil war, and there's some jank, yes, but there is absolutely nothing like the later missions when entire corps of veterans and conscripts are duking it out over important battles with interesting terrain and changing scenarios, where failure doesn't necessarily mean the end of the war.

The potential is amazing and it's great, but it's extremely time consuming for these missions and I have to hype myself up before each campaign, and there's some jank as I've said. Not everything is communicated as clearly as it could be, cannons have a certain field of use (Canister Shot or go home!) and a lot of battles have a strict time limit which can really hurt, especially if your going artillery-heavy Union. The other thing is fortifications, which... Well, some fortifications are better then others and others are just deathtraps where being shot at is considered as being ""flanked."" and instantly breaks your unit. Then there's the missions where they're incredibly useful and help prevent casualties but lowers your damage. 

But, on the other hand, some basic and amazing ideas are introduced. Detaching skirmishers is such a minor thing, but incredibly useful, Consolidation mid-battle, unique types of cannons to use and figure out, strategies you form, and a strong feeling of solidarity with units who you've turned from tier 0 mooks into tier 3 gigachads that are walking death squads, which Total War completely fails to do.

I compare it heavily to Total War since Darthmod worked on this game, one of my more favorite modders who I've followed since Napoleon Total War and dramas around it, and I honestly support him, this game, and his projects out of a hope that it can do what Total War cannot, and deliver a great campaign and experience.

Purchasing pricey and rare quality rifles with superior range and accuracy for veteran regiments was not an easy decision, but could have significant effects on battlefield survivability and effective volume of fire.

The enemy AI is surprisingly nimble and troop maneuvers are a hairy affair. Getting your forces into position with the right timing is a regular struggle, and losing key terrain features can change the dynamic of a battle very quickly. You will have to accept terrible losses at times to prevent losing a battle, even sacrificing a cherished veteran regiment at times. The tension of a critical moment late in a battle can be terrific.

My victory at the battle of Shiloh is a top ten gaming moment for me, racing the clock I had to throw multiple elite regiments into a maelstrom of bullshit to pull it off and launch my entire center into a desperate charge to break the enemy center.

I haven't completed the game playing the Confederacy yet, but it is clearly in your best interests to complete the smaller engagements prior to any of the grand battles, to reduce the size, morale, and equipment advantages of the Union forces.

My only complaint is that it seems the game designers were locked into the real historical timeline, so sometimes it doesn't really matter what you do on the battlefield, the grand battles will progress as they did back in the 1860s.  My latest example is the Battle of Gettysburg.  I'm currently playing through the scenario as a Confederate general and almost completely destroyed the Union forces on the first day of battle while completing every objective.  However, the game just progressed to the next day and the battlefield is setup as if the first day's results never happened.  The Union still has the heights and I'm facing a desperate fight.

That being said, it does have some quirks that I feel detract from the experience.

The game is incredibly linear, with essentially no freedom of strategy. The game will tell you exactly where to defend, exactly where to attack, exactly when to do everything, and exactly what you need to do it. The main parts of the game essentially devolve into resource management, where you have to weigh the difference between the cost of victory and the lives of your men. I feel like this system has some slight bonuses, in that it encourages historical realism in terms of the events of the battles, but it can get pretty derailing or upsetting when scripted events take precedence over real-time tactical analysis. 

An example of this is how your army might consist of large units of elite troops fighting an outnumbered foe, but the mission events and cutscenes will still tell you to retreat because the enemy outnumbers you or is stronger. In the same fashion, you could be outnumbered 4 to 1 and the cutscenes will tell you that the enemy is weakened and that you should push your advantage.

- in my opinion, i've played as the union and confederates, and the union may be somewhat overpowered. there were some battles where there was union brigade, after brigade, after brigade. I know they had more numbers in the civil war - i didn't count here - but i'm pretty sure on some levels they were 4 or 5 times in strength.. even early in the war.. seemed a bit op

Do NOT BUY THIS GAME!!

The 'out of battle' where you can reinforce your armor and replenish your losses is totally unbalanced, especially for the men you cost to win a battle, making it completely pointless to face these battles because it leaves you weaker for the next battles.

This game does NOT deserve any praise as a good game, for it really is not. The developers need to fix this...to cost 74,000 to replenish 1000 men...Veterans, and that is just the cost for the SOLDIERS!

I already had enough guns in the armory to cover that many.

That royally screws the entire reason to even PLAY this game. There is no point...to play, take a total of 22,000 losses and then...IF IM LUCKY able to only replenish...AT MOST 18,000 men.

I just suffered a loss of 4000.

This game offically sucks...and I'm a long time RTS fan, all the way back to the first Command & Conquer games that put this genre on the map.

So...to ALL people who want a GOOD Civil War Game?

Go online to Amazon, buy a Copy of Sid Meyer's Gettysburg and get the fan patchs to the game and play THAT game instead.

The tactics matter more, enemy will attack correctly and adapt to YOUR battle, not historically.

So, if you've stretched your line thin on one end? They'll hit there...hard.

If you've brought up reserves and are waiting for the enemy to hit...say like Picketts' Charge which Ultimate General really FAILS at reproducing...well. It really isn't a contest...this game isn't even worth the money you pay for it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit: Still fails to match Sid Meyer's Gettysburg in terms of scale and ability. I prefer being able to command regiments indiviually instead of by brigade. Much better that way, more fluidity in the field of command & capability...both for me and the AI.

I've played a bit with the updates and while it isn't as screwed as before...it is still not recommendable to anyone want to experience a game that will actually matter as you progress.

Antietam? Rebel army...strength of 45,000. Their losses around 35,000 and they can replenish that and their army is larger now. FUCK THAT! Their army should be much smaller - MUCH SMALLER.

But no...apparently that would be 'too unfair'. Listen, I didn't have to encircle their entire line at sunken road and shoot them into oblivion...but I did. That should matter a hell of a lot in the battles to come...but it doesn't. So...fuck this game.

Its good for occasional bordem...but if you want a real civil war gameplay experience...Napolen Total War with the Civil War mod...or SM:Gettysburg. Much better games.",1484801603,1589624177,False,0,1,0,7,True,False,False

It seems like shortcuts were made in some areas to either make the game more difficult artificially or to avoid the hassle of creating different scenarios. However, the gameplay itself is enjoyable, and it can be fun to manage one's army when in campaign mode.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
- In-depth campaign with a persistent army you grow and use
- Good AI that will normally make decent decisions
- Scenarios that can be exciting and attempt to recreate the POV of whichever side you are in the battle
- Good controls
- A skill system for players that can help make campaigns unique by having different skills at the start

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Artificial scaling of AI
In the campaign, the amount of enemy units will increase with how many units you have in your army, almost always resulting in inferior numbers in a lot of battles, even if historically you should wipe the floor with the enemy, or be massacred by them. This can have some knock-on effects I'll get into below.
- Scenarios can feel very rigid.
I've made scenarios in games before, and I understand how hard it can be to plan for what players do. Especially with a historical game like this, dynamic scenarios can be difficult. Past the early war, it often felt like the scenarios didn't care what the player did. A couple examples that stand out in my mind includes the Union's side of Chancellorsville. In it, the briefing itself says that you should defend, but it could be rewarding to do a risky play and attack the CSA camp. I did that, and did it fairly well. However, when the next day rolled around, my positions were completely reset, I was forced back into my camp, and the Confederates gained an advantageous positions in a battle I was dominating just because of a day swap. It can often make it feel like it's not worth it to do risky plays.

Truthfully, the game is a good game. It can be a fun RTS on the US Civil War, but between issues of scaling and scenarios feeling rigid, the campaign can be frustrating. It seems as though in an effort to make the game more difficult, the developers ended up making it unfair. It feels worthless to invest in ""Recon"" outside of max level recon because battles will sometimes lie significantly with intel, since they often depend on how many units the player brings. It makes me wonder why I even invest in making a larger army if the enemy is always going to be one step ahead of me in order to make it difficult. If a Union player can decimate the Confederates throughout the entire early war, the Confederates shouldn't keep growing at an insane rate. I've had battles in the campaign where I've killed double the historical amount, such as Fredericksburg, where the CSA had under 10,000 casualties historically, but in game I dealt them 21,000. Yet, the CSA was fine in the next battle, acting almost as if that battle never happened.

Scaling itself isn't a bad game mechanic, it's the implementation in Ultimate General: Civil War that feels bad. Games such as XCOM are great at scaling since it works on a schedule, which would work even better for a historical game. The opponent doesn't care how much you have because they'll keep growing on a schedule. I feel like an implementation of that sort of scaling would work great in a historical game.

I have enjoyed strategy games for a very long time, and this ranks up there with my all time favorites. It is intuitive enough to jump into, yet even as a veteran player you will find yourself learning new things regularly. The game is not overly complex (battle or camp), but there is something very satisfying in developing and equipping your army for the next battle. You become attached to your officers and units over the course of the campaign, giving each battle a personal element. Similarly on the field, getting your units into position for a well-executed flank attack and seeing a devastating volley delivered is very rewarding. 

Graphically it is simplistic compared to a Total War Game for example, but this is quickly forgotten once you get sucked in. You will even come to admire the small animations of your troops as they reload, charge and fire. 

You will certainly learn about the soldiers and battles of the US Civil War and gain an appreciation for their experience, and this is perhaps the greatest part of the game. While it is not 100% historical, it makes a genuine effort to emphasize the history. 

Well worth your time and money!

Pros
-There are features that let you manage your forces at the macro/micro level. Adjusting gamespeed and setting movement paths allow you to think tactically. Hotkeys and unit AI allows you to micro manage units quickly or let them make decisions. 
-Really fun game loop. Your troops, commmanders, and generals gain XP. You can build up your army and rank up your commanders and their skillsets the way you want. You are rewarded for winning battles with money, recruits, captured soldiers, etc to add to your army build
-You get to choose the right unit mix to bring into to battle that suits your style and the objectives

Cons
-SCALING IS THE WORST! If you go into battle with a large army, the enemy automatically scales to a large army as well. You are essentially punished for good management. It would be awesome if the devs allowed an option to start your opponent at historical numbers, say ~32K at Bull Run. This would allow you to build your army and punish the enemy vs the AI basically getting free scale at your expense.  
-Linearity of campaign. The multi-day battles while freaking amazing are semi-scripted. You might win an objective that didn't historically happen, for example pushing and taking the battery on the first day at Shiloh, but it gets reset in the next day. It is very difficult to ""re-write"" history between scaling and linearity.  
-Minor: Some of the units need a lot of micromanaging. The skirmishers and cavalry make really stupid decisions sometimes. Cavalry's auto-avoidance of enemy troops sometimes puts it into compromising positions. Skirms will often fall-back and keep falling back despite lack of real threat. 

Despite the glaring auto-scaling fault,  the core game is excellent enough to overcome. The ambience and strategy is overwhelmingly fun. Its a game you will think about when not even playing.

Or let the enemy settle in, roll in your cannons and send them scattering before you charge in. My personal favorite is to bait the enemy to charge then shred them apart with rear and flank guard units. If you're a fan of RTS and enjoy a bit of history then this is a must play.

Towards the last missions, you suddenly lose 75% of your men. Every shot the enemy fires kills 30-50 of mine vs only 5-19 of theirs! 

The 70 hrs I spent in this game is to find and try out different scenarios - even studied and used those suggested in the internet by other players. All the same, I lose 60% of my men!

It seems the developer lost idea on how to counter my play and just simply decided that for every shot my opponent fires kills 30%-70% of my troops as opposed to only 20%-30% of the enemy.

dont listen to other reviews saying skirmishers and cavalry suck, they are just bad at the game. skirmishers are used as stealth and ambush units, i recommend giving them snipers. cavalry is used to rout enemies and capture supplies and destroy cannons. NEVER just send them in at a unit with full morale, they will lose and thats why everyone complains about them. cannons have mixed results, it depends entirely on which ones youre using, i recommend napoleans. the camp menu is great although things can seem expensive early game.

only issues i have with the gameplay are as follows.
sometimes when i single click an enemy, to give the fire command, my unit will think i double tapped, and initiate a charge. this would be fine if the charge didnt have a modest cooldown. 
there are also battles where you will be hopelessly outnumbered if you dont invest in enough men in time, it will catch you by surprise. focus on buying units in the early game before weapons.",1586505775,1586505775,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

You get to control your troops in battle (in a cool way where you draw their paths out on the battlefield) but there isn't any base building. Instead what happens is that after every battle you basically go back to your ""camp"" and you have to recruit new troops into your army, fill up your current units who suffered losses, buy cannons, guns, generals etc from the money you got from the previous battle (basically the gov providing you with funds). This part of the game actually becomes quite strategic and decisions you make on how much $$ or political power you spent can end up haunting you down the line and even end up costing you the war. You can get a game over from the government basically booting you out of the army lol. (recommendation: save often because I have a few campaigns where I basically got to an impassable wall and had to revert back to previous save and change my decision making). 

Also, playing as union and confederates actually feels decently different because of what is actually available to you as each faction. (some diff guns & CSA start with more experienced troops) If you are into civil war this is a no-brainer must buy probably the best civil war game ever created. If you are into historical RTS this is a must buy as well IMO. 

Another thing to mention is that the game is challenging. Particularly the very first battle for the Union is really tough. On my very first play through I did the middle difficult and could not get passed this battle after a few tries, so I went down to the lowest difficulty and still got a run for my money. There are other battles that are very very difficult as well but it's worth noting for those of you who are just starting out that the first Union battle is pretty tough and not all the battles are going to be like that. 

I'm not a civil war expert at all but they do give you a little block of text before each battle telling you what the situation was. There are grand battles and then minor battles and I think even most of the minor battles  (maybe all?) are based off real life battles or skirmishes that took place. I could be wrong on that though. There is a scaling mechanic in this game so the actual # of units in a battle is not historically accurate but one thing that is pretty close to accurate is if the CSA was out numbered in real life, than they will be outnumbered in the game. There are a few battles where CSA had numerical advantage in troops in real life and the game recongizes that. Pretty cool.

The Good: once you get the basic mechanics down, it does a pretty solid representation of the time periods combat. There is a strong sense of immersion as well because you build out your own army as you go.

The Bad: Between each battle you get to replenish brigades and upgrade weapons. These decisions will impact you as time goes on, but the game gives you no real direction on what to do in ""Camp."" So there can be some analysis paralysis as you go.

Dude.... fix the fucking bugs.... this isn't in early access anymore. Whats going on?
Like I first reviewed this 2 years ago and you still haven't fixed any of the bugs listed and also I am still finding new bugs. Did you guys stop supporting this title? I can not enjoy this game without these bugs being fixed. Like I am honestly not at all trying to be a troll or complain because I suck at this game or anything of equivalence. I am just trying to enjoy the game and I cant man. I am really just getting upset that I can not play this game without my units running off the map without any command or without routing. I can not right-click or even drag-direct my units without an enemy not even in view being directed as the target. I'll see 3 of my units nowhere close to where I right-clicked and then I notice their trying to charge an enemy unit? Like bro... come on. You know this isn't normal. I am legit experienced of this game of 2 years now. I know the hot keys for my units. I know how to direct and strategize. But it is unforgiving to just let these bugs fuck with me.... 

I had to restart the battle of Antietam 6 fucking times and I still haven't beaten it because my calvary only works half the time. My infantry is unresponsive and running off map without any enemies being near fucking-by. The cannons won't shoot unless you keep right clicking. Like they shoot then they stop even if the enemy units are still in view and they are fully loaded. You have to keep right clicking on it every so often to keep reminding them. And the biggest problem.... I can right click for my units to shoot one specific target ""IN FRONT OF THEM"" but instead they will turn a full 180 degrees and start marching off the screen.... If I am lucky they will sometimes start to shoot the enemy unit THAT IS BEHIND the unit I want them to to target. 

Like how would you feel if someone just turned off the gravity on you? And everytime your gravity got turned off you had remember to clicked the ""G"" button on your keyboard so you don't float off to space. That would be a really shitty life to live, right? Thats how my game is man!!!!

FIX THIS GAME!!!! I wouldn't be this adamant unless I actually really love your game mates.


_________________________________________________________________________
I've been playing UG:CW for a while now. And I actually came to the store page to see if it was still in early access as there was some bugs that were beginning to make it difficult to progress in the campaign mode. 

I loved this game from the beginning but became more frustrated as I noticed there wasn't much improvement over the months and I began to feel like this was just a rushed game since I couldn't get past the bugs and glitches. 

First, the A.I. would seem to glitch and keep running but not move anywhere. I would attack the said unit with calvary and the calvary would join in the glitch and not attack. Then I will have to retreat but can't seem to get my calvary away from the glitched A.I. and then some skirmishers will come and mow down my calvary. 

Second, my own units will act sporadic, and I don't mean routing or falling back, I am talking about going in for a charge they will just stop moving. I don't understand why I tell them to charge by either pressing the charge button or double clicking the enemy, but they will sometimes just stop and will begin to continue firing after a couple seconds.

Third, when I am zoomed out as far as I can from the battlefield I will try and have my units move, but when I click them to a location they will begin attacking an enemy. As in, when I click to go to a forest line where there is no enemy they will will move towards the closest enemy to them which can be in the opposition direction. It makes flanking very difficult as I will have to zoom out, get to my units, then zoom back in to initiate an attack. I've found out that zooming back in will mitigate the problem, but it becomes annoying.

This game has so many awesome features and I really enjoyed it thoroughly when it was in early access, but I don't know what the heck happened because I just can't seem to use many tactics now as they seem to be bugged or the units are glitched and get stuck on parts of the battlefield that I don't want them in.

Please fix this so I can come back and enjoy the game! Please!

But at the current time of this review, I can not recommend playing unless you want to feel frustration.

Edit:

I thought I'd add to this so it doesn't sound like the game is rubbish. The game itself aside from the glitches and bugs I feel is very enjoyable. Its unique in itself with making decisions based upon your own choices and how battles are played out by your own strategies. The game is well balanced as I've never felt that the enemy has been too strong or given any handicaps, but what does make it difficult is when your own units glitch out and you just get massacred since they are unable to move. Which is really my only complaint, but once that is fixed then I'll feel that the game is even and totally playable.

Edit 2:

Okay so finally pushing through to the end of the Confederate campaign regardless of the bugs and glitches which ruin my units who just won't move or stand still and wont shoot regardless of my commands. Well further in I am beginning to notice something odd that takes a bit of advantage to the glitches. Why the hell do my units, cannons specifically, have problems shooting through my troops which is understandable saying ""Blocked"" while I see enemy units shooting through their troops with no problem? I mean I am playing with some realism in mind, but I dont understand how the enemy units can shoot through their own without so much as collateral casualties, but god forbid I try and try as I might it just comes back to me as saying ""Blocked"".

Also I don't really find it realistic nor tactically sound that cannons can still reload and fire while they're in a melee brawl with my units. I understand if infantry can fire while fully loaded but if in a melee battle where the hell is the time to reload when being surrounded by enemy units? 

I guess I'll give up on this game. I spent countless hours for a futile uphill battle to which I have this to say: ""I must be relieved of my command.""

Edit 3:

Ok so I installed it and came back to it hoping for updates or patches or anything, but nothing. Guessing this game is not being worked on anymore. I can't play, man. I keep getting angrier over this. Like, I bought this game in early access and I sent in bug reports and fuck... Like I'm generally pissed off now. My units keep ignoring me and I can't click anywhere on the map without my units fucking attacking some enemy unit that is nowhere near it. 
I mean I'm like: ""ok, calvary go flank those cannons""
Calvary: ""ok, sir.""
2 minutes later
Calvary: ""Did you tell us to do something? We don't remember.""

First of all motherfucker... I told you to attack and you keep fucking moving all over the map without my orders. Shiloh is like the biggest piece of shit map in this game.

For me, the most interesting facet of the game was in slowly building up my army, supplying it, equipping it, nurturing it and expanding it as the campaign rolled on. From a starting point of a single Brigade your force rapidly snowballs from something that might be found out West in a backwater to a sizable chunk of the Army of the Potomac or North Virginia.

Each battle consumes carefully hoarded resources, so you can find yourself winning the battles but watching your force wither and die, if you do so wastefully. A single advance can bleed you, if it goes wrong, so you'll need to commit scouts, invest in Artillery and tread the line between taking foolish risks and exploiting opportunities.

The Campaign itself has a momentum of its own that drags you from battle to battle - skirmishes and the great set-piece battles of the Civil War.

There are a laundry list of improvements that should have been first on the list for a 2.0 of this game - for a start the War drags you along for the ride - you can choose to ignore the fringe skirmishes if you wish to forgo the advantages in favour of husbanding your resources, but the set-pieces MUST be addressed to move on. There's no diplomatic angle, no maneuvering your forces between battles or anything similar - but given the parameters of the game design, these decisions are understandable.

The graphics are utilitarian but of a consistent and sufficient quality. Gunsmoke hangs in the air, artillery scars the earth and the units serve their purposes. One might have hoped to see some individualisation in weapon types, veterancy and so forth, however.

I really liked the game. Still, I'd say that it's actually a little bit too big in scope. The previous game (Ultimate General: Gettysburg) was a dense and focused retelling of a single battle. Even when you failed to take an objective on day 2, it was fun to see how the set-up and dynamics changed on day 3.

In this ambitious follow-up, Game-Labs ofters the player the experience of living though the entire war. It's a long, bloody, strategically demanding slog. Unlike the war, it doesn't take four years to complete, but after your army has massacred 200 000 yankees/southerners in volley after volley, battle after battle, you almost want to surrender for the sake of your veterans.

You will find the enemy moving in close and charging your line in a heartbeat. One thing that I would recommend is the use of skirmishers but not the one offered up as part of your divisional choice. I always brake them off from my brigades which will allow you to have 2 or more smaller size groups that can be more effective than the larger group. For artillery I like to use 14 to 16 gun brigades and the 12pdr Napoleon is the right choice for close up line defense with the 10pdr Ordnance and the 10pdr Parrot are a good choice for the longer range work and are still effective at short range.

The battles are unforgivingly long, brutal engagements that make you think hard about your decisions. Flanking & rifle companies will be the deciding factor in victory. One volley on an exposed flank can cause a unit of hundreds to route. Rifles allow more accuracy & range which become vital to suppress the waves & waves of enemies you engage later in the campaign. Be sure to invest in high quality arms & be smart how you utilize your artillery. It can be impactful or meaningless depending on how you use it. The campaign is long & spans practically every major battle of the war. It remains fresh throughout, with highly accurate battlefields that you can tell were thoroughly researched & designed. If you’re into military history & strategy games it really is worth playing. It’s about the only strategy of its kind outside of the Total War Series that I truly enjoyed without major complaints. My only complaint is that the achievements revolve around the custom battles, when you wind up beating those same battles through the campaign. Not a big deal, but I like chasing achievements & it’s quite the grind to replay those long battles in custom mode when you should’ve already earned the achievement via the campaign.

Pros
Very fun and addicting 
Easy replay ability
Long campaign 
Creates a constant feeling of desperate fighting, where every battle will matter somewhat, and no victory is for sure
Kind of pretty to look at
Lots of employable strategies
Satisfying 
Corpses

Cons
My biggest gripe is that the enemy doesn't really seem to be slowed down by constant defeats, all the battles will happen regardless of how many you win, and thus it feels a little more like a historical simulator.
Also, it tends to give you some of your tactics to you. Forcibly. As it picks where and how you deploy.
It's a long time of playing.
Confederacy is significantly harder than the union
graphics are very two dimensional, and you rely mostly on number indicators
Not enough corpses.

Just like Dark Omen the game is divided into battles and a management section in between them. The battles consist of using cover effectively, as different terrain gives a different bonus, and trying to bring the morale of hostile units down by flanking them or causing a lot of casualties in a short amount of time. The goal of each battle is to hold or capture predefined points on the map.

During the management section, the player can raise new units, equip them with different weapons and officers as well as reinforce battered ones. This all costs money. Less casualties means more resources for improvements.

The AI is surprisingly competent as it often tries to apply pressure on weak points of the line of battle by shifting units around instead of mindlessly walking forward. It does love it's banzai charges though.

The only annoying thing is that officers can get wounded or killed during battle which will hamper the fire power of the brigade in question. It's basically a dice roll if one unit becomes significantly less powerful.",1585051431,1585051431,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you enjoyed Sierra Entertainment's ""Civil War General"" in the 90s, this game is EXACTLY what you'd like. I already owned Ultimate General: Gettysburg by the same developer, and while it was amusing, it was pretty much just a redone Sid Meier's Gettysburg (which isn't a bad thing, just limited in scope). This game is different, as it has a revamped engine and plays slow and methodical. Battles are pure chaos but lines can be held -- it's not like Total War titles where you're clicking to twitch move like a madman. You can hold formations if you can manage your morale. It's amazing.

Probably the biggest addiction this game has is its management system. If you like Team Manager style games, you'll get hooked on this. Keeping your army hierarchy in order between battles after officers get wounded or killed is so challenging, and struggling to keep enough arms and manpower to fill your brigades is the bread and butter of the campaign. It's not just an RTS -- this is a team manager wrapped up with an amazing campaign of battles.

There are a few bugs and your units will sometimes randomly do things you don't want to them to do, but this can be overlooked by the games in depth features. Not only do you control your units during the battle, you control the planning and development phases where you recruit and equip your army.

Fighting and commanding units at historical battles like Gettysburg and Antietam. Below is what I like and dislike about the game. 

What I like: 
It is not just your units fighting at battles, sometimes (Like First Battle of Bull Run) You get to command AI units, cover is important, if your unit is in forests, or in a crop field, they get some cover, another thing I like about it is that each terrain has there ups and downs. There are a lot, and I mean a lot of different types of weapons. Some are good in melee, some can fire at units from far away (not just artillery), and some that reload in a few real seconds. And the fact that every small or minor battle you win, effects other battles. For example: If you win a battle, in the Major battle the enemy might have decreased moral, or less manpower, or even worse weapons. There is a lot more I can talk about. Now on to the stuff, that I wish was fixed. 
  

What I don't like: 
Retreating units: All units retreat in ever battle and in real life, but what makes me say this is that some times the enemy units will retreat behind your lines. Then your artillery is in danger, or they will flank your units, so they fall back or rout, or even break or surrender. Or even worse, they take your supplies. 

More then 2500 men units: The AI some times have more then 2500 units. But your max for a unit (Infantry) is 2500. So it seems unfair, that they get to have bigger units, even when your the union.  

Time limit: Sometimes the time is your friend (Gaines Mill union) and not (marching threw thick forest at Fredericksburg) The time I think should be extended if there is no other event  and will end based on: If it becomes night, To much men on the other side when attacking   

Other then those,  the rest are very minor, or it's just suggestions. So, if you like single player, massive campaigns? This game is for you!",1578177130,1583094113,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm midway through the campaign so I'm still learning how the game works.  Some of it is common sense, if you see a big stretch of open field better bet that there are cannons somewhere hiding nearby.  Don't run everywhere, you will just wear out your troops and drop morale.  And watch your damn supply wagon, don't let the cavalry or skirmishers take it lol.  All in all, some of the battles can be tough and you feel like you were just crapped on even though you outnumber your enemy 2 to 1.

The historical battles in particular are generally fun.. and it is rewarding to turn small victories into much larger ones.. perhaps you are playing as the Confederates in the battle of Antietam and you are able to slaughter the first couple initial waves of Union troops but as the day wears on you are forced back to the Sunken lane.. well since you were able to inflict heavy casualties early on in the battle the endless tide of blue streaming at you is much more manageable. In my opinion.. this view of the game completely changes after a while.. the charm wears off. There is no dynamic campaign.. which in my opinion this game.. desperately needed to have any long term longevity. Honestly.. the only reason I come back to this game is to attempt the campaigns on the hardest difficulty - which is not fun. This game is like the Total War series in that the AI doesn't actually get smarter on higher difficulties.. it just gets so many troops... elite troops.. that the stupid things that it did before will work out of sheer weight of numbers. The game starts to break down as well.. tactics and strategies that worked on lower difficulties will simply fall apart. As you are trying to min-max and cheese your way through each and every battle now you will start to notice where the game completely fails. Holding a line against the AI? Well just wait until the AI charges your face with superior numbers and more elite troops. Think you are winning that melee battle? Look again.. your troops just received a flanking penalty because the AIs artillery from across the map just landed a couple shots in that general vicinity. Now you have a giant hole in your line as your unit routes.. but as your unit routes that elite infantry brigade that just charged into your lines has engaged another one of your units in melee combat forcing it to turn.. now you have a second unit that will receive a flanking penalty albeit justified this time. Fortunately for you.. your artillery has opened up with canister shot on the intruding elite brigade and sent it packing.. now you can surely plug the hole in your line once your units.. recover? Right? No. Because your units are too busy running the wrong way because instead of just running straight away from the enemy they decided that their best chance of getting away is to run parallel to the enemy lines and continually take fire.

You literally have to save scum before every single battle just to min-max how many troops you are bringing to the field because the amount of troops the AI receives scales to how many men you recruit. Did I mention that the campaign is not dynamic? Completely destroying the enemy in one battle has virtually no impact on the next battle. Think you are a military genius and want to rewrite how some of the major battles of the civil war were fought? Too bad. There is no grand strategic map for you to move corps or divisions around on. So your battle of bull run will play out almost exactly like every single other battle of bull run that anyone who plays this game will have.",1582095835,1582095835,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Nonsensical Combat Mechanics
       - 2000 infantry, rank 2, with the highest accuracy rifles equipped. Firing on 200 guys, in an open field. 20 kills
       - 500 cav, equipped with sabers engage 200 man artillery unit from the flank, in melee. Cav is routed
       - 750 infantry charge through open field into 1500 entrenched infantry. 1500 infantry routed
       - 2000 infantry (while engaging another unit) sit in front of a 24 cannon artillery unit. 2000 infantry never route or panic.
       - Units are ordered to charge an enemy unit will randomly stop and not complete the charge (cav are really guilt of this)

- Large Battles
       - Large scale battles are on rails and heavily scripted. You can be easily winning one phase of the battle, only to have the next phase occur and suddenly all of the ground you have won/held will be given up and you'll automatically be placed in a disadvantageous position. Frequently, any advantage you gain for yourself will just automatically be lost because the battle needs to rearrange the map and units in order to continue.
       - Even if you are doing excellent in the campaign, expect to be hamstrung in bigger battles. You can field tens of thousands of troops more than the enemy, and the battle brief will even show that you'll be deploying a full corps, however they will only allow you to start the battle with 5 brigades (units) so that you suffer significantly more loses than if you started the battle with a full corp.

- Illusion of Persistent Armies/War 
        - The game gives a bunch of stats and elements that would lead you to believe that your victories/loses/draws are impacting the direction of the war. However it's all fake. You can absolute destroy the enemy in a battle, and the next battle they will come at you will nothing but veteran units. You can kill generals, win key victories, win major victories (I've defeated the enemy 3 to 1), and it won't impact the enemies forces or ability to field full armies of veteran units or more brigades than you. 

I'm really disappointed because I wanted to enjoy this game, and early on it felt novel and intriguing.

This game really brings tactics and strategy to the front, giving you the options to do things like detach skirmishers to maybe scout the area or put up a small resistance to buy time for a much larger for to come and help, maybe flank the enemy from the right because there is a road which can make your guys go faster, or the left since there is more cover. Different ways to perceive the battle and it's all in your hands. This game will bust your balls though and in some fights seem unfair. In one of the earlier fights with the Confederacy, you are tasked with holding a bridge and a hill. You lose the first fight to a HUGE amount of enemy troops. It's scripted, however, and a large unit of Confederacy troops comes in, backs you up and hopefully carries the day for you. You can create full fledged battle lines with different companies side by side to fire all at once at an enemy, cannons firing shot after shot to soften the enemy up while your muskets charge into the fray. Huge amounts of casualties by the days end and hopefully your hand raised as a winner at the end. It even has a bit of a customizing army bit where you can kit your division out with different muskets/rifles, different companies and battalions, maybe you need more cannons or cavalry.

It offers a wide selection of battles, units, weapons, tactics, and strategy.

Your soldiers are persistent, and will increase in skill with every battle. Your army will grow over time, and become more powerful. You can even invest in career skills that will change the way the campaign plays out. You are offered a selection of historical battles, and each one is tied together with some optional smaller battles loosely based on historical events.

The graphics are simple, smooth, and polished. Layered 2D sprites give the feeling of a 3D isometric view, holding over from the days of classic RTS games. The color palette is reminiscent of some old Civil War lithographic paintings, and the presentation itself is the very image of a David Greenspan battle map. The puffs of smoke fill the air, the day slowly turns to night, and as the lighting fades from the scene scores of bodies litter the ground amid the brown scars of artillery impacts.

One is left with a sense of horror at the accomplishment of the day's objective, and all of that comes from a presentation that does not rely on blood or gore to convey it's impact.

The sound is basic, but functional. Your muskets pop, your cannons bang, you hear your men cry out in pain as they get hit.
Then the enemy charge rolls in...
Volleys crash together with frightful rapidity, the enemy cheers as they advance at the run, then the lines come together with a clash and an uproar. Every man screams as loud as he can to ward off cowardice as they hack, cut, thrust, and fire into each other's faces. Finally, one side or the other breaks and streams back to whence they came, and the field grows silent once more.

Words can scarcely convey the feel of this game. It has a singular presence I've not felt since a few epic moments in the Take Command series. You get a clear indication of the titanic struggle you're involved with, and it's all wrapped up in a game that is as easy to play as a game of checkers.

So what's not to like?

Well, there's a few things worth mentioning.

1) You never really get a sense of victory as you progress through the campaign. The difficulty of the game ramps up quite steeply even on the 'Normal' mode. Despite winning almost every battle, I never got the feeling I was actually winning the war. The opposing armies were always larger than mine, and by the end of the war the enemy was just as well equipped as I was. There was no sense of a 'turn of the tide' as I stacked enemy bodies upon the battlefield while inflicting three-to-one casualties in my favor. Even with all of the economic career skills maxed out, I never had enough money to maximize the size of my army, and I never had enough money to field even a basic rifled musket like the Springfield in every unit. The Union was supposed to be an economic powerhouse, yet I found myself selling even the fillings in my teeth to equip my army for battle. By the end of the campaign, the enemy outnumbered me two to one, despite the fact I killed far more of them than they did of me at every single encounter.

2) The weapons never really performed the way I thought they would. For example, a unit of 500 skirmishers equipped with scoped sniping rifles couldn't seem to kill more than it's own number of the enemy before running out of ammo. Especially if the enemy was in some kind of cover. Trying to use range and accuracy to inflict casualties without sacrificing manpower never quite came off the way it should. General Sedgewick is safe as houses in this game. Those snipers really CAN'T hit an elephant at this distance.

3) Artillery doesn't work. Period. Having been witness to live firing demonstrations by a 12-pound Napoleon field piece, I can say with absolute certainty the 'King of Battle' has no place on this field. Artillery is hugely inaccurate, and even when it does hit, it does very little damage. This is the exact opposite of reality. Not only is artillery far too ineffective as modeled, but there is no cumulative morale effect on soldiers when being shelled, and cover does not degrade under heavy shelling. Historically, attacking a gun battery was one of the most foolhardy things you could do. It's the sort of thing you would win medals for doing. A simple fix would be to implement a permanent morale loss while being shelled even if it's just one percent morale per direct hit. Another thing I would do is give occupy-able fortifications a number of hit points that would degrade their effectiveness as their hit points are reduced. This would allow the player to bear the cost and restriction of fielding a grand battery in the first place, instead of swapping out that extra field artillery battery for a regiment of foot.

4) Why are there no stabs of flame from firing guns? It makes the battlefield feel a bit sterile. Even just a couple of pixels of bright orange color at the center of the smoke puff would have made a huge difference. I know the real guns don't exactly belch fire when being fired, but in low-light conditions or night battles, some flashes of light and flame would really liven things up.

5) Where is the Rebel Yell? It is conspicuous in it's absence. I never once felt 'that particular corkscrew sensation going down my spine' when the Confederates charged while yelling some generic yelling sound. It just doesn't feel right.

No matter how well (or badly) you're doing in a battle, the game will force you to follow what happened historically. On the 2nd day of Gettysburg, I've stopped the Confederate attacks and am in the process of counterattacking and rolling up their flank. My army's beaten up but I've two corps on the field and the CSA probably has two badly beaten up divisions. I'm about to rout the remnants off the field but the game stops me because it has to do Pickett's Charge the following day. So I get to watch about 5-7k troops (depleted from the previous day) charge 30,000 troops, mostly behind stone walls. I didn't even bother controlling that fight, I instead take two divisions and start rolling up the Confederate army from the south, letting them bleed themselves against my centre. And of course as I'm about to destroy the last division on the field the battle stops because it's now time to fight Lee's retreat. 

The adherence to history is incredibly frustrating in a campaign game where you can be more successful, inflict horrendous losses on the enemy but you're straightjacketed into following the scripted historical path. There's no point in wiping out an enemy corps because it'll be rebuilt next battle and filled with veterans because the game needs to keep the CSA going until the final battle in the campaign. Apparently Lee didn't realize he could just use magic to keep respawning 2-3 star brigades right up until the battle for Richmond.

This game can be good but often becomes an exercise in frustration when you're steamrolling the enemy but the game grinds to a halt because it has to go to another prescripted battle which may no longer make any tactical sense (see Pickett's Charge). I wanted to like this game but it's so damn frustrating.",1581246855,1581246855,False,176,7,0.839230954647064209,0,True,False,False

First despite how great this game is there are cons to this game. At times it could feel too simplistic something that never really bothered me. However, major battles that span over multiple days can be jarring where you can be very successful the first day just for the second day to revert you to the historical positions even if you far out preformed the real life comparisons. I had hoped like Ultimate General Gettysburg they had kept the dynamic way the battle was handled in that game for all of the major battles in this game. For example I wish for battles like Antietam I had the option to carry on the battle for another day if I chose to do so. The same to be true with historically multi-day battles where I might have been clobbered on the first day and have the option to either hold my positions or withdraw and end the battle. The battles are great regardless of these issues but I do wish there was my dynamic interactions with them then there are.

The game however has far more positives. It has an amazing amount of polish and the battlefields are amazing to marvel at. The AI is capable and for the most part feels like a real player. It responds how you would expect a human would in most cases. If it doesn't feel like it has the strength to overcome your positions it won't really try to and will attempt to be more defensive. It made the game in this regard more dynamic with the same battles being different every time based on the condition of the two armies. The Camp system is amazing and I enjoyed naming my brigades and roleplaying a Union or Confederate commander. Battles matter and you decisions in them matter. A victory with heavy losses can come to bite you later in the campaign where you no longer can recoup your losses and slowly find yourself dismissed from the army or flat out destroyed. 

Overall I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a Total War type game that isn't marred in AI difficulties this is the game for you.

Let's go through the 4 unit types:

Infantry, get them. Only them. They're cheap, many & powerful. They have no flaws. They shrug off cavalry charges & flat out ignore artillery & skirmisher fire.

Artillery is the most expensive units you can get, yet they do the least amount of damage, even if you get heavy pieces & put them in grape-range. Those are ideal conditions btw, yet they horrifically under-perform despite their high cost. This is made even worse when you take unit fatigue into account, which makes having another cheaper infantry brigade a far better choice. There is also the issue of them having to limber & unlimber, which is even more reason not to use them. Artillery's only good point is that they can fire past friendly units (their range is also insane, but their damage at max range is pitiful), but due to the size of the maps & the limitations put on the units you can deploy being blocked is rarely a problem.

Cavalry is extremely random, but usually very bad. Low size units that cannot do much ranged damage no matter which weapons they deploy, mounted or dismounted. This would be alright, if the melee system in this game wasn't completely broken. The melee system is extremely random, 250 men can overpower 2500, if they're infantry, but if they're cavalry, never. The only thing that matters in melee is whether is it cavalry & what weapon it has. If it's cavalry it's almost guaranteed to take excessive casualties no matter the circumstances. Cavalry units often even lose against artillery pieces with less men, which is downright pathetic, but then again I have also seen infantry which is more than 10x larger lose against artillery units in melee. Melee is simply broken.

Dedicated skirmisher troops are made obsolete by infantry brigade skirmishers. Why have a dedicated unit of a few hundred skirmishers when you can have over a thousand infantry + a few hundred skirmishers? The dedicated ones are slightly better, but at the price of a nearly full infantry unit? NO LOL. Dedicated skirmishers are only ever worth it if you get the sniper weapons.

There are also a few others like ironclads that are stationary on certain missions & ammo carriages, but meh. They do what you'd expect.

Now, what are wrong with the game's systems/design? Oh, a few things:

The melee is broken asf as mentioned in the cavalry section. Generally speaking low fatigue high veterancy units got a slight edge, but only a little edge. Melee is kinda like a way to get people to back off a bit in most scenarios, not much more. I should also mention that melee combat is less deadly than ranged combat, because bayonets aren't dangerous.

Morale is OK in this game. What isn't is what happens when a unit runs out of it. They start running, usually away from the enemy (but not always) & then if left unmolested after having ran quite a bit they will simply stand where they stopped running. Problem is how long they run away for & how easy it is to keep them running indefinitely. They refuse to surrender is majority of circumstances (although some units will surrender very easily on occasion) & simply keep running whilst getting shot at & getting melee'd. Most units prefer running until death over surrender. Although sometimes units may also decide to fight back after having been molested whilst fleeing & then beat back the enemy & do the same to them, completely reversing the situation out of nowhere.

The damage curve for diminishing returns for large units is crazy in this game. It goes over-board so hard that units past a certain size in fact deal less damage than units of a lower size. The more those big units get beat up the better they become.

There is AI scaling in this game, for the campaign. The whole point of the campaign is to let you build up your army & get stronger over time & balancing things out for the long run. This is all made pointless by scaling, as the stronger you get the stronger the enemy get, but also the weaker you get the weaker the enemy get. Intentionally limiting yourself within certain limits actually make the game easier due to how the AI scales & doing things as effectively as possible is counter-productive due to the AI getting more bonuses than you built up your forces.

The missions in the campaign are heavily scripted. It's to the point where forces are frequently teleported to different places, new units get teleported in & out of the fight. There are also constant reinforcements on both sides. There are arbitrary time limits on a lot of things, like a lot of them. The enemy will refuse to surrender unless utterly crushed or if you achieved all of your main objectives, which may include holding a position for many minutes, so if the enemy have a single weak unit left running around the place you just gotta wait, take up good positions & then see as your units get teleported to bad positions & enemies spawn in all over the place. This heavily scripted level design is completely counter-productive to the rest of the game.

Cavalry logic is illogical. They run around the place erratically, got stuck in fights never intended for them & flee (skirmish behaviour, not morale flight) despite being told to shoot a unit. They also sometimes decide to use their ranged weapons & sometimes not if they got sabers, I got no idea how that works.

Units will on occasion fire a full salvo despite being stuck in melee for the past few seconds, which will inevitable kill more enemies than the entire melee fight.

Fatigue kinda matters. It's usually better just to completely ignore it however to maximize movement & fire-solutions instead. The penalties are too mild for exhausted units & since even simply walking drains fatigue & it recovers so slowly it's best to just learn to play with zero fatigue.

Now let's talk about the lack of realism:

Weapon stats simply make no sense. Farmers are old cheap muskets that got poor stats overall, but incredibly high melee. Pretty much everything else however, even if comparable size, got less melee than the farmer, for no apparent reason.

Cavalrymen that carry sabers cannot dismount. No, not saber as main weapon, but saber as in saber + ranged weapon. If they only got said ranged weapon then they can dismount.

There is a lot of weapon overlaps between skirmishers & cavalry, as well as ranged only & saber + ranged. They all count as being unique weapons from each-other & cannot be mixed in any way. This causes some more obscure weapons that aren't actually that obscure in total to be useless, as you can't capture/buy enough of them to equip a unit, despite technically having the stuff.

Ironclads will simply sit idle in one position regardless of what happens, they're completely immobile. When they have been shot enough they will simply stop working, not sink or anything.

There are magical protective shield buttons that make your units go into specific places spread all over the place that give good bonuses. There is already a well working cover system that works better than this thing, yet they co-exist.

Generals are invincible, but still flee far too early & leave your troops alone unless you explicitly tell them to hold position.

There are also some other major issues I have heard from others but haven't tried out myself as I got no interest in cheesing games, but supposedly this game get become very easy with simple things like cancelling orders & putting units at precise unit strenghts & using small ballast units to reinforce later to bypass scaling & whatnot. Just google these things if you are interested.

So what's good? Pretty much everything else.

Never get into melee with enemy skirmishers.  Ultimate General fact: Delta Force existed in the Civil War.  They were just called skirmishers.  These guys... 200 skirmishers will destroy a 1200 man brigade.  I should record it next time.  They are INSANE.

ALWAYS deploy skirmishers from EVERY brigade.  Skirmishers are by far your must efficient, effective unit.  In fact, why do we even have brigades?  

Don't win battles.  Every time you win, you just massively increase the size of the enemy Army to a point where winning becomes impossible.  The way I see it, with this games scaling mechanics, you can lose to a point where it becomes easy to win.

The Confederates are a powerhouse of industry with massive population centers.  Ultimate General fact: The south during the 1800s held the largest population centers of the world, unrivaled by anything we have seen in the current times.

The enemy has one strategy, and that is to charge, charge, charge.  Just plan your battle plan around that.  Even when they are in the defense, they will charge.

Never recruit anything higher than a Major.  Officers die faster than enlisted soldiers.  Get yourself a colonel for the cost of a new brigade, watch that colonel die immediately.  This game LOVES killing officers till you run out of replacement options.

ALWAYS watch your brigades CLOSELY as they like to adjust angles of fire, become ""blocked"" and then walk casually under fire, at which point they are promptly routed until they are well out of the fight.  This happens without warning and is devastating.  

NEVER use the ""fallback"" command.  SO many times I have used this command, only to watch my brigade ""fallback"" right into the enemy they were shooting at, start melee, and get destroyed.",1479365716,1579710761,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(1) Some battles are so big, that the map (and your army) gets split in pieces during the course of the game, causing parts of your troops to accidentally end up in theatres they weren't supposed to end up in. (2) The game also might have a bit of an unhealthly obsession with capping-points on the battlemap (checkpoints that might cause you to instantly lose the battle if not occupied by your troops). Some of these checkpoint might be located on positions that might have made historical sense, but don't always make sense in the game itself, and can be rage inducing the first time they troll you. 

Nonetheless, there are no flaws in this game that can't be corrected with practice, and you will easily get dozens of hours of fun for a reasonable price.",1578340509,1578966541,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Namely - the AI gets to scale upwards. Which means it is compensated for its lack of AI by having way more units than you. This is not as severe in latest patched version of the game. But it is a tad annoying.
The campaign mode is really a series of historical battles linked with a few ahistorical fights. The issue here is that victories seem less important. You have play out the failure of McLellans peninsula campaign. Later on even if you win Fredericksburg as the Federal you still have to play out Chancellorsville.  Its not a deal breaker as such but it is odd to play the role of a commander of the federal/confederate army - attain different results but still play out the same historical fights. 

Cavalry units seem to pointless. They are simply not as effective as they actually were. 

The AI tends to employ skirmish forces that way too effective and seemingly bulletproof. It also gets to field silly huge brigades of 3000 men or more.  I think this is to compensate for the AI's lack of AI at times. 

But what the game does succeed at is the sense of scale and drama of a civil war battle. You get into some seriously tough and punishing fights. Having to rebuild shattered units after one tough battle, forced me to use way more clever tactics. These are the kind of games I enjoy.

You play the role of either a Union or Confederate army commander, starting out with a small command that you can build up over time with additional corps, divisions and brigades. 

The game has light role playing elements to it as well and I did find myself getting attached to my veteran brigades, trying to keep them for when the battle was at it's crucial moments (not wanting to throw away veteran troops on minor engagements).

Between battles you refit your army, you can purchase additional weapons (all with different attributes) so it's up to you to balance things. With finite resources to hand you have to decide whether it would be better to raise new brigades with fresh recruits, or do you spend a lot of money on reinforcing your veteran units with more experienced men? If you add raw recruits to your veteran brigades their stats will suffer. This becomes a big juggling act, especially when you play as the resource strapped Confederates as the war goes on.

I think this is a great game, have played various strategy games for many many years, going back to C64 and Amiga 500 days. I am thoroughly enjoying this game and intend on sinking many more hours into it.

Yes, the graphics aren't the best, but other than that this is a great strategy game that is pretty simple on the face of it but does offer depth and some re-playability.

I'd rate it 8/10

What I dislike is that I have found that I haven't been able win every battle even in easy mode for the Confederate campaign. I don't expect it to be a walk over but I do expect easy difficulty to be actually easy and it not to get impossible halfway through the Confederate Campaign unless you have disgusting amounts of casualties.
When I have ever started doing well as a Confederate, causing massive casualties on the Union, capturing lots of supplies, weapons and inflicting huge defeats on them, I can usually get to a certain point (the battle of Chattanooga) where every battle is unwinnable or winnable but with huge casualties which totally spoils the game. It just makes me really stressed and angry when the hole point of playing games is to de-stress, not cause more.
The reason for this can't be explained by choosing the Confederacy historically as if the Confederacy had caused lots of casualties and captured lots of weapons etc. from the Union, it would have been a lot easier for the Confederacy later on, not harder and the Union will to fight would have been greatly reduced so more of their units should be more willing to rout easier and Confederate morale with more large victories would be way better, more volunteers would be produced and quality of soldiers should be better. Also the Union would have had less 1851 Pattern Enfields due to the factory in England probably being unwilling to supply more weapons just for them to get destroyed or captured and they would sell them to the Confederacy instead as they were seen as doing better so it would be better to have the Union equipped with more 1955 Springfields instead.
There is a glitch where at the end of a battle, you get the choice to continue fighting battle or finish it, I have found that quite often it will finish the battle without me clicking on the ""Finish"" button. This is usually just before I have had a chance to finish the battle how I want which can if I have just captured the final objective and have to hold it for a little longer, which causes me to loose the battle. In other cases, I have the choice to totally wipe the enemy army out, capture lots of supplies etc. and am forced to finish the battle, letting enemy troops that I could have defeated or captured get away.
Another point is that if you capture more than 1,000 men you can only exchange them for 1,500 men. I see that this is to replicate what happened in real life, however unlike real life where if say I had 2,000 prisoners and wanted to get back a captured Officer I would exchange them, you just get 1,000 regular troops and never get any captured officers back. You should have a choice on weather you want to get an officer back or an amount of regular soldiers back. Also if you are exchanging regular troops, it should be either man for man (e.g. you capture 3,500 men and get 3,500 back) or if you have more captured NCOs or Officers or just lots of prisoners you should be rewarded by getting more prisoners back from the enemy (you have captured 4,500 prisoners with officers and NCOs amongs them so get 5,400 back) and not have a system where you can only get up to 1,500 prisoners back, no matter how many you have captured and none being returned being officers.
Also you should be able to capture enemy officers and exchange them like in real life. e.g. if you capture Burnside. you could either exchange him for say another General such as Lee if Lee was captured or exchange him for a large amount of regular troops such as 5,000 regular troops.
It would also be nice if you didn't have to micro manage each unit. It is annoying that that these great officers you have such as General Longstreet or Lee or Picket don't manage how they deploy their troops. These men would have and should in the game use their skills to deploy their troops to the best of their skills to defeat the enemy and send you messages if they are being badly damaged for you to come back and fix their problems. You can also get problems such as you form a perfect pocket around some enemy units and you leave it to be destroyed to focus on another more important part of the battlefield, only to go back and find the unit has routed through one of your units which are stuck in one place doing nothing as the enemy unit recovers and attacks.
Another point is that you can have captured an enemy unit and send them off the battle and they can be right next to the edge of the map but instead of leaving by the nearest edge of the map, they run right across into the enemy and be re-armed/freed and fight against you again, there should be the possibility for captured units not to either run into areas where you are fighting and for them to go to the nearest edge of the map to be taken off the map.
Also you can kill lots of enemy troops but the amount of captured weapons you can get off the dead enemy seems to be a lot less than it should be, even if you include the ones destroyed in combat. I've had battles where I've killed over 15,000 Union Infantry and I've only got numbers like 1,000 rubbish Farmer rifles and 400 Harpers Ferry 1855 rifles back when I know for a fact that the enemy had been using Sharps Rifles as they said it on in game text or the rate of damage they had been able to inflict on my units meant they were using more advanced rifles and these units I totally destroyed so should at least get 80% of the Sharps Rifles from these units rather than none.
Another point is the system where you have a large army for a major battle as the Confederacy, the Union will have 3x as many troops as you, even when this can be over the actual amount of troops ever fielded during the Civil War or in the Battle you are fighting.
Another point is that you can equip a unit with Henry Rifles, but even if they are a veteran unit, they are very ineffective, which if it was real, this would be very different and they would overwhelm units armed with single shot percussion rifles or muskets such as shown in the Battle of Koniggratz in 1866, just after the Civil War, in Europe where Prussian soldiers with single shot breach loading rifles destroyed an Austrian force armed with single shot percussion rifles.
Also when you use a unit with Henry Rifles, they only fire 1 volley and don't have a quick rate of fire which they would have had with Henry Rifles unless this has recently been changed.
It is a good game and I do like it, but these negative factors have just made me dislike it and stop playing it often. I know I sound a bit like a History Buff (which I am) and there is the excuse that this is just a game, however it does say it's meant to be historical and playable. I would play it more often if these above factors were fixed.",1568321229,1578701993,True,0,0,0.471695452928543091,0,True,False,False

Based on how well you are doing in the campaign effects how much money etc can be obtained from the government to support you for more troops and better weapons. Though can even use captured weapons.

Your brigades also automatically change formation at appropriate times.

+Attention to detail, particularly in historical scenarios
+Very satisfying army management system - it's great to watch your initial small army of green recruits armed with muskets slowly develop into a large, hardened, well armed band of grizzled veterans.

-Steep learning curve and definite frustration to be had, but that's part of the challenge. 
-Somewhat questionable AI at times
-Some information needs to be more transparent. For instance, sometimes when reinforcements show up, you're not informed properly and unless you watch the minimap like a hawk, you can have a whole division sat around unused for half the battle.

These are comparatively minor gripes though, it's well-made, well-presented, it looks nice, mostly plays well and is a lot of fun.

1) It is not an open map campaign where you can influence where battles occur and manage strategic resources, instead there are set (historical) battles and you can manage the order of battle and equipped weapons etc. and choose which battle to do first to an extent. I had hoped for some form of TW format, or hex based. This was not game-breaking but 2) below is for me.

2) The other side seems to always have massively more troops than you; I just can't figure it out. Some people blame 'scaling' others say this is now not a thing. I've tried different numbers of troops in brigades, different number of corps but it just makes no sense. Neither does how troops come into a battle, why you can't use others at all sometimes. And why in the last battle was I facing massive brigades of 2500 men against my maximum 1500 AND they had more brigades? Perhaps this is historical? But after trying both sides the feeling was the same for each: pending doom. Even the few battles won were pyrrhic it seems.

The atmosphere is good, the limited campaign offering is nice in what it does, the game runs nicely and I really enjoyed the battles in Gettysburg, so I'm extra disappointed that this just seems crushingly difficult on its normal setting, you shouldn't have to debuff the AI side to get a normal experience.

I recommend that you play in this mode first to learn the mechanics of the game. 
Is it accurate in history, yes and no. But that's the idea of why the game is good. Changing history, You also get to manage your own general and army. Giving them proper manpower, experience and weapon. There's two purpose of these either you're own defensive or offensive. Defensive is easy, offensive you might fail the mission especially there is a timer.
You can also use cover for you troops, which is strategy. The importance of infantry is the key your success on this game. You can use Calvary, artillery even skirmish units, but there is no way you can win a mission without infantry, which is accurate in civil war history, Infantry the backbone of every army.

Past: played UG: Gettysburg. Didn't really understand it enough to enjoy it at first, but that's why I played as the Union first: wiggle-room to make mistakes :P. Anyway, one crucial detail, for example, was how the units only regained Morale in the presence of their respective Corps commander. Never explained in the Tutorials, not really implied anywhere, just had to experiment. Problem was, the base game had several issues like this to overall make playing the game...partly satisfying. 

Present: have gotten past Battle of Shiloh (good God I needed a bigger army than I had), but I made it work much better than expected (only lost my skirmishers, but I haven't nailed that down yet and I just needed raw BODIES to slow em down). Why tell you this? Because I felt I had a better degree of control and influence over individual unit performance than in UG: Gettysburg. Controlling the Corps composition itself also helped, as I knew exactly what was in each Corps and I can usually deploy an entire Corps all together, so no worries about missing units or morale (they do allow ANY commander to replace Morale, thank God).

Overall: due to the control you possess over your armies composition, the relative control you have over their deployment (smaller, but better equipped, # of divisions/corps helps with this), and the improved feedback I get during battle, I feel much more in control and capable of responding to various threats and conditions. 

In Short: a better style of play, in my opinion, than UG: Gettysburg will ever be. 

Pro-Tip: hesitate to use provided cover, it's usually a deathtrap. Used in Shiloh only with ""free"" units (not from my own Corps), or by units with no ammo, since the only real good buff is to melee combat...which ironically enough actually helped, since that particular spot was RIGHT ON TOP OF the control point.",1575274736,1575274736,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

GOOD
- It feels like the civil war and you are pushed most of the time to play the way the war was fought in those times - so it feels realistic, most of the time...

- I like the ability of building my own army, being able to customise it, get different types of equipment and veterancy system etc. 

BAD
- You never know how to distribute your troops pre-battle in order to align with the set up plan, which wastes a lot of my time.
Big battles have few slots where you have to allocate your divisions before the battle begins. The problem is that sometimes I overshoot 1 side and didnt put enough troops into the other slots. The multi-turn (days) battle has to be repeated because near the end you realise that in that slot you actually need many more brigades than you could guess at the beginning. It is most of the time total guess and I was forced to watch YT movies to see where which division will go and will have to do... this is so annoying.

- Weird concept of 2 units fighting in tight melee and guns firing at them cannisters with almost no friendly fire casualties. You just take the cheapest rookie troops, send them to fight in melee or use them as a screen, keep your best shooting units behind and just shoot into them - no friendly fire. 

- After losing LoS your units run ahead blindly and suicide. 
If you command your unit to attack an enemy unit which will later run away and be blocked by an other enemy unit, your guys will run into them blindly. After loosing line of sight they just run forward and you find your best troops in the middle of their trenches alone...

You will create your Corps and your Army (which is cool actually).  But you have to be very careful about spending on luxuries...like arty and cavalry.  neither seemed to have much of an effect.

Because I overspent on foolish things like supplies and arty, I was mauled in one battle, and because I couldn't afford more troops, in the following battle I was SEVERELY outnumbered.  Basically enemy divisions were just appearing all over the map.  And I had also mauled the enemy in the previous battle.  Again, arty and cavalry seemed useless.

No multiplayerin this when the first game had it, is a huge disappointment. Managing your supply lines in this game is also extremely frustrating, and artillery gives you less control over what shot to use and when, as compared to the first game.

11/27/19*** 

*** The experience this game offers has improved significantly as-of my last-playing-it. I believe further, minor-improvements were added after I last played, as-well...

Certain battles are thrilling to play, once you have figured-out how to best employ the historically-representative units you (""MAY"") be afforded in a given scenario, with ""battle-start"" circumstances and AI 'action-reactions' and strategical-performance, ACTUALLY tending-to-vary, which (now) affords this game massive-potential, and-currently, exciting-play-throughs--at-least, up to a certain """"point'"" .

The lack of detail regarding the player's command-and-control functionality does impact, and hinder the engagement of ""veteran-players"" from the previous installment in the '""franchise""', and--where Ultimate General: Civil War may improve-in-artistic-detail, and down-to-the-second unit-versus-unit outcomes (in like 16-bit, mAnNn...)-- it feels like this game just-misses the same ""wow""-factor, which makes ""armchair-generals"" love the first title: despite the fact that ""Civil War"" is-CERTAINLY an-improvement, upon ""--Gettysburg"" ... 

A game THIS-IMMERSIVE--fun--and down-right beautifully-designed-and-executed (by a small developer-team, with pixels--no-less!): and-of-ALL-things-- NON-HARDWARE-INTENSIVE, not-only-DESERVES:: BUT-SHOULD-REQUIRE---- MULTIPLAYER-FUNCTIONALITY...

I keep coming back to the game and playing through again because the ability you have to change your army. The first few times I played I went hard on infantry and numbers to win. In later campaigns I used more cavalry and artillery and it was a whole different experience. I even went and tried no infantry at all and it was great; I managed to get completely destroyed in later battles, but it was cool trying to find strange ways to attack and defend without infantry. No onto the good and bad.

Pros:
- Awesome Graphics
- Design your own army
- Chose bonuses and traits for your units, officers, and army as a whole
- A ton of battles
- Lots of replay ability
- Realistic casualties depending or distance, weapons, terrain and experience
- Historical units
- Casualties transfer between days in a multiday battle
- Favor points to get extra stuff (weapons, cash, men, generals) that are gained or lost depending if you win or lose a battle

Cons:
- No multiplayer :(
- Once and a while a unit glitches or does something weird (usually cavalry attacking fortified infantry or something similar)
- Not much really

Not really a con to me, but some people complain about regaining loses for the confederates and such as being unrealistic. This is because if you play on a hard difficulty then the AI needs to make up those loses and to make the game challenging. I find nothing wrong with this since if you want the game truly historical and to be able to steamroll the south every battle then you can play on the easiest difficulty.

Fight the battle at Bull Run and then your army is magically transported to far away Tennessee to fight at Shiloh.

I love RTS games, and Ultimate General takes the genre to a new level. Massive battles with hundreds of thousands of troops rage for hours as you fight for whichever side you choose, Confederate or Union. The actual mechanics of the battles are masterfully configured, allowing total control of your troops and tactics. Variables like hills, cover, morale, ammo, and more come into play. For me, it was hard to find an RTS that matches the gameplay of UG. 

The campaign is fun and relatively long - you can probably get 25 - 50 hours of gameplay from one time through the campaign, depending on how much you decide to complete and how long you choose to spend customizing your brigades. It would be cool if the campaign was a bit more free flowing - all of the battles and their sequences are preset and unchangeable - but with this format of a game that would be a whole additional undertaking. 

Overall, this is one of my favorite games of all time, and I can't recommend it enough. Now....Chaaaaaaarge!",1574271809,1574271809,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat design in this game is robust and simple. Players which act as as an Army commander can control multi corps on a same map and give commands down to brigade level. The battles controls in this game are mostly fluent except the final battle of Richmond, which is ridiculous complex and could be easily turned into a butcher's house.

Some small tips to those who want to try this game:
1 Cavalry units are acting as an auxiliary force at this point of history. So cavalry units should avoid direct engagement with infantry whenever possible, unless the enemy is weakened.
2 In this game, the artillery pieces are not accurate enough at mid or long range, and is devastating at close range.The volleys of artillery at short range can severely damage the enemy's morale.
3 Numerical advantage is crucial. If you are a Northern player, do not try to build an elite army and do not recruit too many veterans at the early stage of the war. On contrast, you should use the recourse to train more units.",1573081856,1573081856,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

get it on sale, will reduce the frustration and help with the some enjoyment. there was lots of little stupid but by third day of second Manassas i had it.  what logic to have the ai move your troops out of defense to just make you waste manpower to take them back, because they are suppose to be in those defense.  you carried the day so why would they leave. 

You also don't know that you don't have the right size army organization till you start the battle.  You understand that there will be money and manpower issues, it is a war game.  When the scenario you want to play makes you loose more than you gained,  It starts to lose it appeal.

Ok, updating played the union this time destroyed the confederacy at Bull Run no units left on the board.  The next battle they are a full army.  Nearly destroyed their army again at Shiloh and got to 2nd Bull Run they had a functioning army again.  Had all the other objectives but stone point.  On the second day had the flay fully surround but could not get it.  The next days field reset my units are on other side of the map.  March them across why trying to sort them out.  Get to the center again while destroying some enemy brigades along the way. Note that 5 cavalry brigades at nearly full strength cannot destroy one artillery brigade from behind.  get to center again and battle ends not in draw at least but defeat.  Make sure you always check that victory conditions there is some others that do not come up in the briefing.  Replayed the battle check before the end both conditions are green, won battle on in game conditions and the final result came up defeat.  The game is broken especially the second bull run.

The campaign plays much different based on difficulty settings. It is possible to win as either the Confederates or the Union on any of the three(+) levels. I enjoy that the outcomes of the battles affect other battles int he campaign, but the campaign itself somewhat railroads you into playing a specific set of battles in a largely chronological order.

For those that are fans of an ancient retro hex turn based game called Civil War Generals, i think you will like this game as it really reminded me of that game despite this game having pausable real time combat.

Before i talk about the flaws, i just want to mention the things i love about the game.

1. A persistent army that follows you throughout the campaign from 1861 - 1864 that you can manage and tweak to your hearts content. Create egiments of infantry, artillery, snipers and cavalry. Buy weapons and equip them with different rifles, cannon etc. Tons of fun! And each regiment will improve their stats based on their actions on the battlefield: accuracy, melee etc.

2. Excellent combat mechanics. Each regiment has Morale and fatigue modeled.Experienced troops fight harder and longer. You need to flank enemies or concentrate artillery fire in order to rout enemies to push them back. Gain defensive bonus fighting from woods or behind walls. And a decently challenging AI keeps you on your toes somewhat.

But unfortunately the game has flaws.
1. The campaign is just a static series of battles. You could slaughter the yanks at Antietem or Gettysburg and nothing changes. You just proceed to the next historical battle. 

2. Each battle is standalone and there is no consequence or link between each. Example: i sent my best troops to raid Harpers Ferry in the Antietem campaign. Historically these troops would not be able to make it back to fight in Antietem until late in the afternoon. In this game, these same troops were fresh and ready to fight in the morning at Antietem and i promptly slaughtered the Union army.

3.The enemy army will just replenish in size and difficulty based on your damage to them each battle. Slaughter 10,000 men. The enemy just replaces them with 15,000 experienced troops. Kill 5,000 of their men, they just replace them with 8,000 new recruits. This is meant to ensure the battles scale in difficulty to your progress, but it just makes my battlefield achievements feel kind of meaningless.

Because of these flaws the campaign can feel kind of boring because there is no sense of consequence to each battle. You just fight the battles over and over again and none of your actions on the battlefield feels like it matters.

In the end i still give this game a thumbs up because i love these sorts of army management game despite its boring and flawed campaign mechanics.",1561800783,1572628857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The core gameplay combines real time strategy, role playing progressions, resource management, and battle planning. Although predominantly focused on RTS battles, the incorporation of these other elements adds depth and fills out what would otherwise be less-than-fulfilling content. It would by no means be a bad game outright if it was just a series of RTS battles set in the civil war, but these additional elements do add to the replay value and make the player experience feel more directly impactful. At times, I felt like I didn’t just beat the AI by commanding preset units to adhere to a preset strategy and engage with preset tactics; I won by molding the army into my army and I overcame as a direct result of my decisions. Admittedly, though, I grew to feel boxed in by many hidden constraints… but more on that later. 

Some RPG elements are incorporated in your role as commander, as well as each corps, division, and brigade. These elements provide bonuses that are almost entirely statistical, but they do add some flavor. After each battle, you are rewarded with money, troops, and reputation that corresponds with how well you performed. You can then use these to buy munitions, train new units, replenish old ones, and appoint new unit leaders. And like the armchair generals’ real-world counterparts, a lot of care needs to be taken with the between-battle logistics, otherwise you are likely to find yourself outnumbered and outgunned the next time you encounter the enemy. 

The RTS battles really cement this series as the spiritual successor to Sid Meier’s Gettysburg. The battle actions are more intuitive – you can simply move your troops by dragging the route you want them to take without your units tripping all over each other – but there are some downsides. Units lines of sight are denoted only by a nearly imperceptible shadow that is cast over the map when a single unit is selected. Couple that with a lack of clearly defined topographical elevations and it’s impossible to position cannons on cannons on useful hilltops. 

From a grand strategy perspective, winning a battle does impact future battles, although often not by much. For example, after successfully defending a supply depot (and routing the enemy, I might add), my reward was having the enemy army’s size being reduced by a paltry 5% in the next Grand Battle. From a narrative perspective, it seems like it would have been a great opportunity to offer a temporary discount on munitions, which always seem to be in short supply, or increase how many are in stock to purchase – but no, just the static 5% reduction in enemy troops.

In another instance, I barely managed to squeak out a victory when attacking a convoy and was rewarded with a 10% reduction to the enemy’s weapon quality in the next Grand Battle. I then replayed it and crushed the convoy, and received the exact same reward. This lack of impact in a Grand Strategy sense makes victories feel less important. Sure, pre-scripting the impact of one battle on another is easier to balance, but it disincentivizes routing your enemy, favors minimizing your own losses, and ultimately reduces replayability. 

Conversely, the role-playing elements improved the replay value. As a general, you are awarded a Career Point or two after each victorious battle that you can then invest in assorted general-specific proficiencies – Politics, Economy, Medicine, Army Organization, Training, Logistics, and Reconnaissance – all of which improve proportionally with your Career Point investments. These proficiencies feel quite balanced insofar as none are completely over or underpowered and encourage replaying the game to try out new command strategies. 

They can be configured to compliment however you command. For instance, I tended to rely heavily on skirmishers to scout out enemy movements, so points in reconnaissance weren’t nearly as valuable to me – focusing on Politics and Training helped me ensure I could fill out my thinned lines with veteran troops after each battle. 

Your brigades, divisions, and corps can also improve independently, contingent on the experience gained by their respective commanding officers. This aspect is wonderfully unforgiving. If you repeatedly put your high-level officers in do-or-die situations, you’re likely to effectively neuter your army. 

When it comes to resource management, you are tasked with maintaining your army by recruiting troops, adding brigades, divisions, corps; and all the while keeping your financial, personnel, and reputation reserves balanced. If any of these reserves get too low, your army will reflect it in terms of poor quality weapons, poor quality or too few troops, or low morale. That said, usually you can see an imbalance coming a mile away and react before it becomes a serious problem.

Unfortunately, at the battle planning stage of the game, it starts to become clear: All the prep work you’ve done only affords you the illusion of control. The choices you make to customize your army are not fully realized in the battles.

Each battle has a maximum number of corps and brigades that you can field, irrespective of the size of your army. Let’s say you decide to build an army with many troops in an effort to simply overwhelm the enemy with numbers, you will be unable to field your entire army – and what’s more, you won’t be able to even select which troops you want to field! As a result, you’ll end up fielding a random assortment of brigades. This is a jarring disconnect. Why would the game award resources for trouncing the enemy if it’s going to turn right around and hamstring you when you try to make use of them?

Furthermore, the amount of soldiers the enemy fields in each battle is largely unaffected by your actions in prior battles. Again, I can appreciate that each side would reasonably be reinforced between battles, but after sustaining multiple crushing defeats in short succession there would come a point when the enemy wouldn’t be able to field armies as large, or you’d gain some other tactical advantage, such as a terrain or strategic resources. The player is effectively disincentivized from totally crushing the enemy in battle after battle, because they are likely to face a completely reinforced enemy army no matter what. 

And when deploying troops, the game restricts you even more. You are only occasionally permitted to deploy your troops at the onset of battle; and when you are, you’re allotted a very small area compared to the rest of the map. And if a battle takes place over multiple days or phases, it automatically places your troops wherever it sees fit, irrespective of wherever you had left them the previous phase. 

Overall, Ultimate General: Civil War is sleek, but the features don’t coalesce into a satisfying experience. It feels like a stepping stone game that’s just not quite there yet – like Game-Labs wants it be immersive enough to entice a hardcore enthusiast, yet simple enough that a casual player can take to it quickly, too. Unfortunately, their aim is just a little off.

All in all, you’ll likely enjoy this game if you go into it expecting to play a predetermined series of battles without being true to history, and about which you only have the illusion of self-determination. If you’re looking for a game that’s true-to-history or expect the spread of battles to more dynamically change based on your actions, then you will likely be disappointed.",1531573839,1572482697,False,8,0,0.525713682174682617,0,True,False,False

The battles, even though they don't look ""amazing"" actually feel kind of cool, the art is nice and it's not the worst thing to look at. 

My only gripe is that there doesn't really seem to be a consequence when you win, you don't prevent the campaign AI from doing what they're going to do in the next phase. You can absolutely smash the enemy and cause 90% losses across the board and you'll still end up fighting Gettysburg, albeit against a foe that is really weak.

All that said the bar has been set pretty high before this kind of game can be rated outstanding.

Units: Infantry, Artillery, Cavalry and Skirmish units are possible.  There is a good choice of artillery with both smooth bore and rifled cannon.  Unfortunately smooth bore can fire canister shot through their own side and only kill the enemy.  Major fail.  Same with volley fire when units are in melee.  Equally there seems little area effect against other enemy units.  A canon shot misses... you see it land in another formation but that takes no damage 99% of the time (maybe 100%).  Volley fire either hits the unit aimed at or misses, another unit in the firing line takes no damage.

For each unit there is choice of size, weapons, leader and with experience, their development path.  Skirmishers can basically become snipers or recon.  Artillery can specialize in long range (generally best for top quality rifled) or short range (best for smoothbore).  Cavalry can be shock cavalry with sabres or mounted infantry.  Movement is walk or run.

Battlefield orientation is preset.  Bottom to top or left to right, whichever they have chosen, that is what you get.

Unit formation is fixed by the game.  No squares for cavalry attacks, no stretching your line thin.  Send infantry to march a distance and they go into something like column formation, but you have no control of this.

Cavalry when mounted is just a gaggle with no formation.  Cavalry attacks on artillery are lamentably slow to resolve after the merge.  Not a quick killing spree and certainly no running off with the guns.

It is impressive for its detail, the level of control you have over the size and equipment of your corps, and so far in my campaign (Chancellorsville) it seems fairly balanced--though the challenge is increasing. I'm playing on a relatively low difficulty to learn the ropes, so it is both satisfying and with a little guilt that I use my campaign loot to outfit and maintain an army that even George McClellan would have taken into combat. 

It is possible to keep your force at/near 100% strength continually--but your defeated enemy doesn't seem to slow down much either.

The AI is pretty solid but occasionally does strange things. It seems to be very important in the game (as in real life) not to allow your forces to be flanked--or they will openly rout. Once in a while an infantry brigades decides to pull out of formation seemingly on its own accord and oblique in the wrong f***ing direction, but I'm usually able to pull it back into line before they rout. Also concealment in forest and wheat fields actually provide cover bonuses.

A few more unit behavior commands would be extremely helpful, but as it exists it is perfectly functional.

I think you have to be a Civil War enthusiast to really enjoy the game; there is no opportunity to deviate from the on-rails historical path in-campaign even if the outcome of a battle would have altered the course of the war, so you are essentially maintaining an army between encounters. But it is well-done and as a tactical/strategy game it is entertaining.

So first couple campaigns did not end very well, tried Confederate and Union sides.  Once I had a better understanding of the way things worked, started a new campaign as the Confederates.  I upgrade my Corps, give them the best of the best weapons, have more Artillery then I can shake a stick at, don't have much cavalry, not a huge fan of the unit type in other RTS games, and honestly one good volley from a well trained Corps with great weapons, they retreat anyways.

Anyways, back to the campaign. So I win every battle, some were much harder then others, especially the battles the Confederacy actually lost in real life, get all the way to the Battle of Cold Harbor. By this point its later in the game, so the Union side has suffered great losses and they can barely manage to muster the amount of required units per battle while I'm deploying almost double the units.  So first start of the battle, I fight them off their control points and start setting up for the inevitable counter-attack/charge.  I did not notice out on the far right, a unit, albeit a small ragtag corps moving to my flank.  Once I notice them, I think silly Union you cannot hope to dislodge my battle hardened veteran troops from this road with that! Well I spoke way to soon...by the time that flanking Corps started its charge, 5 others started charging my stretched out battle line.  Before my troops could fire their first volley, they lost all morale and ran..and i lost that battle, which at this point the game entered the state of ""If you lose, you lose the war."" So I lost my entire campaign because my soldiers did not eat their wheaties that morning lol.  Just thought to myself, well that sucks! Took a break and then restarted the campaign to try again.

Each battle is a great challenge, and as you go on they become epic in scale.  The army manager is great, and the small elements of character development work really well, giving you an added sense of attachment to your unit and army commanders.

All in all a brilliant effort, and the devs can certainly count me as a real fan of their work.

My original review, however, did note a few problems before I start praising the game, here:

#1 - Steep learning curve. The first couple battles are the hardest in the game, really, and there's no tutorial... create your general, and instantly in a battle. It's very poorly thought-out, as the difficulty is front-loaded and serves to push players away if they aren't patient enough.

#2 - Some quality-of-life issues that will never be fixed it looks like. Enemy cavalry sometimes glitch right through your units without taking damage, and some battles still have an issue where supply wagons disappear from time to time on Day 2.

#3 - The campaign is pretty much just a mission select screen. The only real choice between battles is how to re-equip your troops, which is a ton of fun but means that the battles themselves are quite linear... the only option for battles is if you want to skip minor battles between the big ones.

#4 - CPU never withdraws troops. Ever. So, unlike Total War where a routed unit can leave the field, UG:CW sees units get stuck routing at the map edge, and you can easily exploit this time and again. This is my only major gripe with CPU play, though.


All of that said, the *tactical* part of the game is very good. 

CPU movement and decision making (aside from my #4 complaint above) is really good. If a CPU unit is about to get flanked by a big force, it sometimes will move back to make itself safe again. CPU will send cavalry to capture my supply wagons, and will keep units out of the front line in order to let them recover (if they can) before charging again. And the CPU spreads out to cover the field well... unlike in Total War, where units can really bunch up, the CPU in this game usually spreads out well unless I flank or encircle and push them all into a pocket.

Further, the tactical mechanics are varied and interesting. Old equipment may not fire well at long range, but at short range can still be useful. Cavalry includes a melee option, and skirmishers can be equipped with sniper rifle-muskets, given carbines like the cavalry, or get repeating rifles. 

And the control... the control is very simple, and is the least difficult part of the game to learn. The only thing I find silly with controls is that I can't group units into number-bound groups. You still can use division and corps grouping quite well, but when I need ad-hoc grouping, I do miss being able to make my own groups.



Overall, I really enjoy the game for what it is. Civil War purists, however, are going to maybe scoff at the fact that friendly fire is practically non-existent, and at the inability to really change the campaign in any way (for instance, a Confederate win at Gettysburg still results in fighting at Chickamauga for the next battle... changing the course of history in the biggest battles feels underwhelming the moment you get back to the campaign screen).

Arcade-y though it is, and steep learning curve though it has, I find it one of the best RTS experiences on Steam regarding the CPU play, and that's why I have over 1,000 hrs in game, here.",1500295476,1567958758,True,1,0,0.522613048553466797,18,True,False,False

The strategy is amazing, the concept is almost flawless, and it is very well executed. It actually makes you stress over supplies, manpower, and equipment, which is amazing. However I just finished a battle which singlehandedly made me change my review about this game. After a good strong campaign as the Confederates, I reached 2nd Manassas. The battle went fantastically, and after nearly two hours of fighting the battle I was finally on the verge of completely demolishing the enemy army, a crushing blow that would dramatically impact the campaign. However, at the last second, a random group of enemy skirmishers, probably no more than 120 men, managed to somehow circumvent my entire army, my many pickets behind the lines, and my cavalry patrols, and somehow captured my main point. As the battle was nearly done anyway, the time was almost out and victory was within sight. When the timer ran out, however, low and behold on my screen the words ""Defeat""!!!!! Because a hundred men I didn't know had escaped from routing managed to apparently seize the hilltop objective (despite their entire army being dead on the field) it was viewed that I failed to hold my position and therefore lost the battle.

But if you expect anything more from the game, you might be disappointed.

The game has a campaign, but it's essentially just a string of historical battles where you can carry your units from one battle to the next. It works quite well for this game, but if you expect a Total War or Paradox style world map where you can choose your own encounters and pick your battles, you're going to be disappointed. You move from historical battle to historical battle, with major battles being mandatory and smaller battles being optional. Tackling and winning the optional battles will give you a bonus for the major battles. Let's say you win a minor engagement before Gettysburg, this will lead to the enemy force having 10% fewer men at Gettysburg, simulating the effects of your successful battle.

You carry your units from battle to battle. They gain experience and improve their accuracy, morale, reloading speed, melee charge, etc. You can also upgrade their equipment. Starting out with a rookie regiment armed with old smoothbore muskets and seeing them grow to be an elite regiment equipped with high quality Fayetteville rifles is pretty cool. You can freely design your army corps as you want it, with infantry, cavalry, skirmishers and artillery. Your choice of equipment can determine their combat role: equipping cavalry with sabers and pistols makes them great at melee charges, while equipping them with long range carbines turns them into mounted skirmishers.

This is the extent of continuity in the campaign, though. You carry over your army and it gathers experience, you can influence the next major battle by winning minor battles. But if you inflict 50% losses on the enemy army in a major battle, they'll still be back at full strength in the next one (unless a minor battle before it gave you the ""10% less enemy soldiers"" bonus). So in that way, the histoical battles are pretty static. You will always fight the same army at Gettysburg, for example, even if you managed to absolutely crush the enemy at Chancellorsville before it.

This is why some people gave this game negative reviews: it feels a little inconsistent that your campaign performance has such a low impact on how the battles play out. But a complex campaign just isn't the point of this game: the campaign is just an excuse to string a couple of historical engagements together and allow the player to train and equip his own custom army corps.

The battles themselves are quite fun to play through. They're essentially Total War battles (no wonder, considering the dev used to make mods for Total War before he went on to make commercial games), except larger, slower, and with a better AI. Battlefields can be huge, and so can be the amount of troops you get to lead. It's not uncommon to have over 20 regiments under your command and fighting at 3 different fronts. The battle objectives are all about taking and/or holding victory points, determined by historical objectives of the army you play as. For example, at Antietam the objective of the Confederates is to hold Dunker Church and Sunken Road, and later Burnside's corps will attack at Burnside Bridge and you'll have to defend that, too.

Often, to make the huge battles more manageable, the battles will happen in stages and the battlefield will expand as the game progresses. At Antietam, you start out only defending Dunker Church, later on the map expands to the south and you also get to defend Sunken Road. And even later, it expands again to include Burnside Bridge. These map expansions usually happen when reinforcements arrive, which are based on the time at which they historically arrived. So if you know how a battle played out historically, you'll know what to expect. This creates interesting situations where you try to desperately hold onto defensive ground against an enemy that outnumbers you, knowing that in half an hour, Stonewall Jackson will arrive with some troops to reinforce you. But the same goes for the enemy. You might be close to taking a victory point, but then enemy reinforcements arrive and push you back. This makes timing rather important.

Speaking of timing, battles also run on a timer. Usually, that timer is pretty generous. Battles can start at 6 in the morning and run until 22 in the evening. Sometimes, goals will shift as the day progresses (for example, you start out defending your position, but once a reinforcing corps arrives to your left, your new goal is to roll up the enemy flank with the reinforcements and take their camp). Most major battles take more than one day. At Chancellorsville as the Confederates, for example, you're supposed to take the Union camp, but during your first assault, Union reinforcements arrive and force you to pull back. If you don't take the objective before time runs out, the battle will end and skip to evening, where Jackson flanks the enemy camp. If you still don't manage to take the objective then, the battle will progress to the third day where you get to drive the demoralized defenders out of their camp (but at the end of the day, they receive further reinforcements).

The battlefield constantly shifts and moves as reinforcements arrive and goals are changed. Due to the size of the battlefields and the amount of units involved, the battles usually don't devolve into Total War's complete routs. You might be routing the left flank of the enemy, but your own troops are retreating from the right flank as they're overpowered by enemy artillery. This turns battles into more than just binary affairs where you either rout the enemy or he routs you. Flanking and outmaneuvering the enemy is important, and the key to victory, but it's not as easy as in Total War either because you don't see the enemy positions unless they're within line of sight of one of your units. So using light cavalry as scouts to spot enemy movements is actually important (as it was historically), ambushes can happen naturally by troops hiding in a heavily forested area and shooting once an enemy comes near, etc. It also makes flanking and maneuvering more risky since you can never be sure if there's not an enemy on that hill over there...

The AI is, overall, decent. It's nowhere near genius level and I managed to consistently beat it in every scenario, but it puts up more of a fight than most Total War games, at least. The AI attempts sensible tactics like concentrating its force to push against one point of your defensive like rather than spreading out, using its cavalry to go behind your lines and harrass your artillery, etc etc. As long as you use cover (forming your battle lines in woodlands rather than open fields) and rotate your troops whenever things get hairy (pull back a demoralized and exhausted regiment and have a fresh regiment take its place), you can easily push back the enemy advances. Assaults are, of course, a bit more difficult than defenses, and will require you to reposition your artillery, attack enemy strong points from multiple directions to get a flanking bonus, etc. Overall the AI offers up a decent challenge, but don't expect it to be a master tactician like Robert E. Lee himself.


Conclusion:

If fighting historical battles from the US Civil War, while commanding huge amounts of units on ever-shifting battlefields and performing grand maneuvers to outwit the enemy sounds appealing to you, you should absolutely get this game. If you want a campaign like in a Total War game, where you pick your own engagements and determine the route of conquest yourself, this isn't the game for you. The campaign is just a loose connection of historical battles, not an open world map where you freely move armies around. The battles, however, are pretty great and absolutely worth it.",1564929665,1564929918,True,8,0,0.591033577919006348,1,True,False,False

Even playing the easiest difficulty starting as a colonel, you still feel tired after a while into the campaign, because after all, you are fighting and trying to win a war... 

The AI design could be improved, unrealistic ""routing"" maneuver such as ""falling back"" in enemy's controlled territory or even falling back through the enemy's line is extremely annoying and unreal in life. However, the game did bring us back to the mid-19th century where machine gun is yet to be invented and trench warfare is just being introduced into the battlefield. The game definitely requires a cunning mind out of the player as a commander of their legion, and it surely trains one to always look at the big picture and respond fast to every move on the battle field. 

The campaign design was pretty good, but it could add in more movements in the western theater for sure. And also, since the player has the power to change the outcome of each historical battle, the game should respond more to turning point battles such as winning as the Confederates at Gettysburg and such. The campaign in general should stray away further from history (or having a choice option leading to different endings as done in Dynasty Warriors 8) since a historical battles mode is already present and independent of the campaign mode. 

Lastly, multiplayer mode? If we could pull up the camera closer to the units fighting with an even better graphics that would be super cool. Great game after all, I hope to some further updates.",1563402221,1563402221,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
502520,54148829,76561198090256460,0,3,1769,0,1432,1632858240,"The reason I acquired this game was basically based on the positive reviews. Although the game plays (that is) runs well and does not have any ""bugs"", I find it lacking in depth. It is interesting that many of the reviews here and else where have stated that this is not a ""Total War"" game.   This is true. However,  this should have sparked my thought process, in that, comparing it to the ""Total War Standard"",  this game does not have the complexity and variance of a Total War game. This is true of any standard we make,  like saying a certain car is ""almost like"" a Mercedes. 

So why do I say this? First, there is no real carryover from battle to battle,  sure you get to recruit replacements etc... but any real tactical or strategic advantage that you have gained is lost. For example, Shiloh is a multi-day battle and you may have really kicked butt, either as north or south in the first day, but if you don't close out the battle on day one, you are sent to Pittsburgh Landing  on day 2 . Also, if you win the grand battle, and continue to the next campaign the model just sets up the next historical theater. That is,  say you win Shiloh, you can't exploit that victory by capturing territory in the West, instead you are immediately sent to the Peninsular Campaign.  So there is no real continuity. Yes,  the enemy army is penalized somewhat, but you really can't gain a strategic advantage.  

Second, you really can't pick your own ground, but are limited to historically how the armies were set. Not saying that is always a bad thing, as one may enjoy the challenge. However, I am not sure that being locked into Pickett's Charge is a good thing for your army. 

I think, at this point l will stop with the comparisons of the game to the ""Total War Experience"". Except to say that the detail (visually) of your troops, as well as, variations in movement and  formation are well below that of  Total War.  Overall, I was disappointed with the game, in that, the continuity and consequences of battle outcome are missing, as well as, the freedom to alter strategic objectives.  One would like to see a Creative Assembly game for this conflict .

Since it has been 21 years since Meier's computer civil war game was introduce to the public. The Ultimate General: Civil War takes some of the ideas of Meier's in regards to troop movement, deployment, combat moral and polishes them up.  Moreover, this civil war game has some improvements over the Meier's series. The game adds, ""Supply Wagon's"" to keep your amry in the field going. So you have to protect them. If you don't then you may have a reduce fire rate with your troops. Plus, you have many more major and minor engagements against the AI.

Ultimate General: Civil War game rules are very easy to read and understand. In some explainations of the game rules the game providers have photographs, videos, or both so it is easy to understand how to play the game. Even though it is helpful to the beginner I would have been more helpful with a hands learning excersise of a minor battle to learn the basics.  The Ultimate General: Civil War provides the gamer with a array of historical battles from the American Civil War, and of course the player choice of playing the Union or the Confederates. 

Their are three different game levels, from beginer, historical to difficult. These levels provide the gamer a bonus in playing. In the beginer mode the AI has a -25% moral reduction on its troops. Now, even though I played the Union forces at the battle of ""Bull's Run"" at least three times, it wasn't until the fourth time I defeated the Southern forces.  The AI, is no dummy and will take advantage of your weak points within your battle plan. 

I have played the ""Campaign"" level.  What I have learned is that you have the ability to build your own army for either the ""Union"" or ""Confederates."" When you build the army, you have various choices to choose from regarding the training, equipment, type of officers leading them. You can also replace officers that have been killed, capture enemy supplies, troops, also obtain information from your spies in the field. If you capture the enemy supplies you may gain different rifles to arm your troops or additional ammo for your cannons. You play out the historical battles of the civil war.  Depending on which side you choose, you will be in different situations with your troops, and be in major battles like ""Bull Run"" or ""Franklin"".

The game does take so time to handle especially with using a mouse, to direct your troops on the game map board. It may be very fustrating especially during the heat of battle. Some game units are difficult to take orders, especially your mounted troops. When you order 200 mounted men to charge a enemy of 600 infantry, they may stop short of this and retreat. The reason my be the unit morale, leader, and any support to back them up.  It is best to keep your eye on your unit's morale when you do a charge into a major position on the battle field. Mounted troops do better when a enemy formations that are withdrawing or routed. When they charge batteries formations from the side or behind they can force the formation to retreat. 

There are a few downsides to this game, the game audio is very boring. It is of civil war actors saying the same thing in a endless loop before and during battles, the music is very dull also. The second, is that the computer AI isn't very smart at times, during a battle, and it doesn't know when to take advantage against its human player in key battle situations. Sometimes, you are left shorthanded because of limitations regarding troops in a critical battle, and the computer AI sends wave after wave of troops in infantry charges and your left wondering where is my reinforcements arriving?  Depending on the amount of men you throw into a battle, the computer AI will either send in massive amounts of troops nearly two to one in its favor being the Union, or send in elite formations for the south.

In closing if you want to learn how to learn to move and attack the enemy on the field this computer game is good for the begin. Ultimate General, ACW is a stepping stone in learning a computer war game.",1528477950,1563212953,True,0,0,0.490478932857513428,0,True,False,False

 -Battles are truly epic, uses Total War style large unit management, does it better than total war!
 -Army management between battles make campaign cumulative, doing well will allow you to strengthen your force, and do better in later battles
 -Terrain actually impacts battles, significantly. Unit morale, condition, and terrain are essential in your strategy, makes the game feel more realistic, and your strategy and method will grow and improve as you learn
 -Despite advanced, realistic battle conditions, the game is easy to play once you understand it
 -The AI is not susceptible to a single mechanic as in most RTS games, the AI is smart enough to adjust its tactics as the battle progresses and will look for weaknesses or attempt to bait you into mistakes.
 -The battles feel costly, as units clash, your constantly shifting units trying to preserve your force, or reinforce a weakening position
 -Battles are objective based, you cant just mass units, what you bring to the fight is what you have, and you must take, or hold your objectives to take the field, the objectives are also sensible and in most cases historically correct

Worst Features:
 -Battles have time limits which is not bad by itself, but the time limits are sometimes silly, having 4 in game hours to take a position that historically you would have had at least an entire day, or multiple days, sometimes rushes you into attacks you would not have made in the real scenario

 -Large battles are broken into sections, that gradually come back together, this is actually nice as it makes managing the field simpler, however each time the shift happens a VERY jarring freeze to the battle, with a text notification comes up. sometimes its well placed, but some battles its aweful, Shiloh is especially bad.

That's half the appeal, the other half being the ability to gradually build up and customise one's army as new guns are captured or bought in the armory. Officers being wounded or killed, an graduating and bein available in the barracks, make post-battle reorganisation even more critical. The fact that each battle has an impact both in losses of men and materiel but also in units cquiring experience and the player receiving reinforcements accordingly are an additional incentive.

Of course it is not a game without drawbacks. The main one has to do with its scope and its predecessor. It's obvious that, given the change in sheer scale, Civil War cannot afford to go into anywhere as much detail regarding alternative paths as Gettysburg did. The campaigns are rigid and battles are forced to unfold much in the same way as historically through more or less important victory points. A point of great confusion is the presence at the start of major battles of victory points that in later stages disappear, and prove to be completely irrelevant to the success or failure of the battle. 

Such flaws notwithstanding, Civil War is a thoroughly engaging game. Fights, within their bounds, are fairly dynamic. You *can* win Gettysburg on the first day. You can repel the enemy, surround it, and destroy it utterly. There is great pleasure in seeing enemy numbers dwindle as they carry out a futile charge after another into well entrenched and well-supported units. There is even greater pleasure in knowing that it is you who have prepared and disposed your units so. Even more importantly, the organisation phase is a welcome break from so much battling, which if continuous would threaten to become monotonous.

A humble game with great aspirations. 4/5",1562539767,1562539767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I believe this is a good game with quality play-ability and replay-ability. You can play as both Union and Confederate on multiple different difficulties with many different perks to choose from with dozens of battles to play through. Is it worth $30? Well, I caught it for 65% off, so I can't really say. I probably would pay full price for it now after knowing how much I enjoy it. If you're still borderline after reading reviews, perhaps wait to catch it on sale.

[*]The grand scale of the campaign, hours of game-play and replay-ability.
[*]Dynamic ""career"" perks and options, there are many things to help you in different ways during your time as general.
[*]Mostly** realistic fighting for the period. 
[/list]

[b]The Good: [/b]
[list]
[*]Historical accuracy on weapons and strengths/weaknesses of both armies
[*]Well written campaign text provides immersion for those who enjoy reading it.
[*]Your wins, or losses, affect future battles in a multitude of ways.
[/list]

[b]The Neutral: [/b]

[*]Graphics. They're good, but they aren't great for an epic campaign game.
[*]The method of recruiting soldiers and how it affects your brigade ranks.
[/list]

[b]The Bad: [/b]
[list]
[*]There doesn't seem to be any form of ""friendly fire"" in this game.
[*]It can be quite easy to sort of ""glitch"" routing brigades into a permanent rout until they withdraw.
[/list]

[b]The Awful: [/b]
[list]
[*]The method of flanking units which are behind some sort of entrenchment or cover seems to be quite broken.
[/list]

[b]The Explanation: [/b]
So to expand on a few things above, the career perks and options are fantastic. They allow you to choose between recovering some of your fallen men after battle, cheaper prices on weapons, receiving a higher percentage of gold and manpower for battles played, more organization for bigger unit sizes, getting more ammunition for your units and finally more recon on the enemy army and units. Depending what you pick out of these, and in which order, will largely decide how your army fights, or should fight at the very least. 

The fighting, as stated, is [u]mostly[/u] realistic for the time period. There are a few things which doesn't seem to quite line up however. For one thing, I haven't been able to notice any sort of friendly fire mechanic. Now, for a casual player, this may be fine. For someone who wants to be immersed in the battle, tactics and strategy it is a little disheartening though. I've had artillery crews fire canister shot point blank into the back of their own unit and not do any damage to their own unit, only to have the enemy unit suffer 50+ casualties. I've also seen one or more brigade turn and fire into a friendly brigade being charged by the enemy. Now in these, there are casualties in the friendly unit since they're being charged, but their casualties do not seem to reflect taking any damage from these friendly brigades firing into them. Now don't get me wrong, I'm certainly not saying it isn't possible for some of this to occur with minimal friendly casualties. It just doesn't seem like there's even that, which are two of the three negative things I pointed out above. 

Speaking of immersion though, there is quite good text on the battles that provides some immersion for those who enjoy reading through their games. Further, how your army performs and if they win or lose dramatically affect how you will fight your next battle(s). For example, one particular battle may be extremely easy to win as far as the objectives go, but it comes at the cost of men. If played recklessly, one can win, but they'll find their army under strength for the next battle or two. On the other side of the coin, it can be appealing to attempt to out maneuver and out flank enemy(ies) as well, but if in a grand battle that can take multiple days if objectives aren't taken quickly enough, it may equal more overall casualties than simply using a more brute force method. So taking multiple factors into account is critical, and likely separates those who can complete this game on it's ""legendary"" setting and those who can't. 

And lastly, the bit I mentioned about sort of ""glitching"" routing armies into a permanent rout/withdraw is a problem but it isn't a huge issue. Mostly you see this either in battles where you vastly outnumber the enemy forces or where the total forces are small enough to successfully do it. Basically it entails getting a unit to route, then while they're routing and retreating you keep a skirmisher unit or a cavalry unit on them to shoot/melee them and they'll basically never ""un-route"" and return to battle. In the majority of battles though, this is very difficult to pull off since units will mostly retreat into their own reinforcements making sending skirmishers/cavalry for them either very risky or impossible. 

Overall, those who enjoy strategy, tactics, history and battle/military of that period would enjoy this game. I did not enjoy ""Ultimate General: Gettysburg"" nearly as much, as it was mostly unrefined and didn't offer as much control as you see in this game. So don't be turned off if you've played but did not care for that.",1562460143,1562460248,True,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0,True,False,False

- Improves upon the mechanics of the previous game, Ultimate General: Gettysburg.
- Cannons are now easier to fire
- Bigger scale. Instead of just one battle and one army, you now command up to 5 Corps and participate in every major battle, and a bunch of smaller ones, from the start of the war to the very end at at the ""what-if"" battles of either Washington or Richmond.
- The sounds of rifles, cannons and music all seem improved.
- You can pause and still issue orders!

The Bad:

- No option to ""auto-reinforce"" your brigades/ cannons/ cavalry units. Each one has to be reinforced with men manually.
- Significant frame drops in the bigger/-est battles. Understandable when you have 100k soldiers per side, but still a shame.
- The campaign is not as ""sandbox"" as the previous installment. 
- You cannot ""draw"" the path of several brigades at once as you could in the previous installment. If you want to move say 3 brigades to the same hill, across the map, but avoid forests/ rivers, you either draw each brigade's path individually or right click and hope for the best.

There are oddities with the mechanics that let you perform questionable tactics (like firing grapeshot into a melee of friendly and enemy soldiers and only killing enemies), the AI doesn't really keep up with a more advanced player other than just increasing its numbers, there are some mechanics from the previous game that I miss somewhat (e.g. Gettysburg featured radically different deployment plans and tactical choices that could be made in between phases of the battle, while Civil War railroads you somewhat), and unfortunately there are no plans to create a multiplayer.

However, this game still manages to be incredibly enjoyable. The strategic campaign of the game allows you to slowly build up your force from a single division to a multi-corps army that you are intimately familiar with. You foster elite units that follow you from battle to battle. You watch as commanders you recruited as majors early on become major generals commanding entire divisions later on. You wrestle with equipment and manpower. If you are defeated in battle, you may not be able to replace all of your losses going into the next battle, and veteran units can be prohibitively expensive to maintain at the same experience level after heavy losses. As the Confederacy, you are highly limited in advanced weapons, and often rely on capturing it from defeated Union armies. As the Union, you may be able to completely deplete Confederate manpower by the end of the war with a string of successful battles. As either side, you can leverage your reputation from battle victories for more resources from your respective governments, at risk of being sacked if your reputation falls too low from a string of defeats.

On an operational level, each stage of the game features a major historical battle of the war (1st and 2nd Bull Run, Shiloh, Antietam, Gettysburg, etc. etc.), culminating in a fictional battle of Richmond (for the Union) or Washington (for the Confederacy). And each of these major battles is accompanied by a few minor skirmishes/battles (I don't think all of these are historical battles) that are optional. From these secondary battles, you can gain more resources and reputation to help you for the major battle, but it comes at the risk of depleting your army and reputation if you lose.

Tactically, the game makes use of a number of different features to keep the battles dynamic, that are all distilled into a very intelligible and useful UI. Trees and buildings on the battlefield give bonuses to a unit's cover, preventing many losses when they are shot at by enemy units. On the flipside, units are extremely vulnerable while crossing rivers or marshes due to a lack of cover, slowed movement, and difficulty firing their own weapons. Morale impacts when units end up fleeing and refuse to take your orders. Heavy casualties sharply reduces morale, but so can the psychological effect of being shot at from the flanks or the rear. Units also have a Condition level, which measures how tired they are, and thus impacts their movement and firing speed, requiring you to occasionally cycle out units and make hard choices about whether to get reinforcements to the frontline immediately or keep them as fresh as possible in sacrifice of time. Units lose supply with every shot they fire, causing dangerous situations for an army if their units start running out of bullets, especially if the enemy is harassing your supply wagons. Last but not least, different equipment also plays a major role in battle. Rifled guns are expensive to purchase for your army, but are far more effective than the smoothbores you start with. Different types of cannons specialize in different ranges and accuracy. For a few small units, you may even be able to outfit them with repeating carbines, or scoped rifles towards the later part of the war.

Overall, the synthesis of compelling gameplay at multiple levels of strategy makes me recommend this game despite it having some flaws.",1561834662,1561834662,True,38,1,0.786325514316558838,0,True,False,False

Cavalry is somehow slower than running infantry. I suppose this is because they don't want you having the ability to route enemy units that run away from the others so you can demolish them, but still its annoying and makes no sense
The biggest thing holding this game back are the lack of impactful victories. For example, if you play as the Confederacy and win the battle of Gettysburg, it makes no difference to the campaign. It would have been nice if the devs put some effort in theoretical battles that would happen if you won major battles. Like if you could continue to invade the North after Gettysburg.

You literally get punished for out thinking your opponent because of how the battles are scripted, it has happened to me in several of the campaign battles in which I'll arbitrarily ""lose"" or ""draw"" rather than win because of how the game was ""intended"" to be played.
1. The game suggests you retreat (because that's what happened historically, or something), but I have enough forces and have so decisively beaten my opponent that it's more disadvantageous for me to do so. Well, that means the ""victory"" point is several miles from my army -- a single unit, one enemy unit, goes around my entire line and caps that point which means that when the time runs out -- even though I've slaughtered 95% of their army at a cost of 20% of mine I still lose the battle.
2. Or, another battle, I advance and capture two of the control points early in the match, because their listed as ""victory"" points, and have a wonderful strenuous and desperate defense around them -- the time runs out. And a new timer begins. I'm supposed to hold for another half hour (time works strangely in this game) when before I hadn't even been informed of such. If I had literally not captured those points and let the AI beat themselves against my defenses earlier I could have easily had those points, but noooooooo! 
I out thought and fought the AI and was punished for it. That's not strategic, at least not in my opinion. 
3. Thirdly, there are literally some battles in which the AI wont react beyond the base order that the narrative gives them and as such you can literally ignore the main body of their threat and outflank them with minimum effort.

Also, I read a comment where someone was praising the game because flanking the enemy didn't cause them to ""instantly"" rout, but I disagree, flanking in this game isn't as important in this game as it is in Total War games, but I wouldn't consider that a bonus to the strategy more of a demonstration of the lack there of.

The importance of ""winning"" ""losing"" or ""drawing"" in a battle is as such; you have five resources to spend between each battle to gradually develop your army, they are; Money, Recruits/Veterans, Weapons, Reputation, and Career Points. The first three come in varying amounts depending on the Win/lose/draw result and you get one Career Point for winning every battle and two from major battles. However, you if you lose or draw most battles you lose reputation, losing enough immediately ends your campaign -- you can get a maximum of 100 -- and you can spend the rest to requisition more for the first three resources from the government. In both my Union campaigns I've either had a deficit of Recruits and Weapons or a deficit of Money and Weapons, and that is with the second one being Victorious in every battle.

Pros:
-Historical accuracy (as far as I can see)
-Control over armies, generals, etc. (feels like your actions have an impact)
-Difficulty (just like the civil war, you can lose horribly and/or lose thousands of lives)
-Able to play as both the CSA and the USA, with unique experiences on both sides

Cons:
-Lack of music
-Some battles, especially side missions, can feel repetitive
-I wish there was more tied in with history, like message from the president or more background info
-Feels like the outcome of the battle doesn't matter, like you still have to go through each battle no matter how well you do. Like, if you've won every single battle why would Lee still attack in Pennsylvania?

It doesn't have the budget of a Total War game, but it's a deep and interesting representation of the era. You may be turned off by the 2D graphics, but don't be; the game is easy to follow, the UI is clear and concise.

In the campaign you build your army over time, gaining extra troops, money and captured munitions depending on your successes or failures. My first force was a single corps, 6,000 men, 16 guns. Now I've got 3 corps, 70,000 men, 700 guns. I've named units, they've levelled up as I've played. Now my I corps is my elite fighting force. The officers leading each unit are experienced men that provide bonuses to them.

I've played both Union and Confederate campaigns, both of which are long (I've still not finished either with all my play time).

The way line of sight works, in conjunction with each infantry unit being able to detach a small force of skirmishers, or light company, means you'll have to explore out and probe the enemy. The cover system as well creates safe defensive lines among forests and crops, turning open fields in to killing zones with artillery pummelling units. The morale then comes in to play, with units far more likely to turn and run than stand and be cut down. This encourages aggressive play, a well backed up assault that storms an enemy weak point can overwhelm and break the line. An unsupported or poorly coordinated charge will certainly result in defeat.

There is a prisoner system as well, where routing units are able to be captured and controlled, unable to fight. You can use this to pull enemy units out of the battle, hiding them all at the back. Or you can get your cavalry behind their line and capture their supply wagons, and supplies are important in this game. Units that run out of ammo can still fire, although at a well reduced rate, and captured ammo wagons can supply your troops. If you can steal the enemies wagons you can push hard and overwhelm them with firepower.

The game has 3 major components: campaign, historical battles, and custom battles. The difficulty has 3 settings: easy (colonel), regular (brig. general), and hard (major general). The difficulty can be set at the start of the campaign and at the start of each historical battle. It took me about 150 hours of actual playtime (my Steam hours is about 200 with idling, game minimized, etc.) to complete both campaigns and all historical battles from both sides. That is a pretty great cost to enjoyment ratio, and I have never played any custom battles yet.

The campaign allows you to play as a General for either side through 11 major offensives, each consisting of 1-3 ""minor battles"" and 1 ""major battle"". The same locations will be the site of multiple battles (just as it was in real life) so several of the maps are reused multiple times. That may be viewed negatively by some, but each scenario is very unique. Not only are troop positions different, but the landscape will be somewhat altered over time and the actual playable area is changed frequently. All of these factors combine to keep each mission in the campaign interesting and enjoyable.

During the campaign, you are restricted by two main factors: money and manpower. Each battle will earn or cost you an amount of prestige, money, and manpower based on the outcome (victory, draw, or defeat). Each victory will also earn you ""career points"" that can be invested in various bonuses such as intel (more information before battle), medicine (restoring some of your men after combat), politics (increasing the resources you get from each battle), economy (reducing the cost of new equipment), and others. Capturing enemy POWs will get you up to 1000 additional recruits each battle, and capturing enemy supply wagons will net you some extra cash (the exact amount will be shown in the after action report). Taking enemy prisoners can also earn you large amounts of captured weapons that you can reequip to your own men or sell for extra money.

The historical battles include all the scenarios that form the ""major battles"" from the campaign. These situations can vary greatly from your experience of that battle during the campaign (for example, you may have significantly less troops available or a very different unit composition) and are very much worth playing even if you play the campaign.

The gameplay can be viewed as pretty simple, there are only 4 types of unit: infantry, skirmishers, artillery, and cavalry. However, there is a lot of nuance as well. Each unit type has a variety of weapons available to them with different characteristics that can completely change how a unit should be used. For example, cavalry can be equipped with carbines as mounted scout infantry (who may dismount to fight) or with revolving rifles and sabers as proper cavalry (who need to get a lot closer to shoot and can't dismount to fight). Skirmishers might be using sawed-off shotguns for CQC in a forest, or they might be equipped with telescopic sighted rifles and shoot from afar. Artillery can similarly be divided into smoothbore (longer range) and rifled (more direct). Infantry will mostly use muskets but you can create elite units with 15-round magazine rifles or revolvers.

The achievements are rational, reasonable goals. If you play through all content you will 100% this game. There is no hunting required and no DLC.

A nice feature is that your saves are organized into folders based on the game mode so ""historical"" saves will never get mixed in with ""campaign"" saves. Additionally, the game allows multiple saves of the same name, so unless you intentionally select a save to be overwritten you won't lose your progress.

Graphically, the game is not impressive but that isn't really expected from an RTS that is trying to show battles that involved 10s of thousands of soldiers. The upside is that you don't need much under the hood to run this game. Even most potato-powered PCs should be able to run Ultimate General with no real issues.

Overall, a great game and very much worth buying, even at the full price of $30.",1559194612,1559194624,True,5,0,0.575888514518737793,0,True,False,False

The difficulty is pretty good across all modes - and if you are not watching the battle close enough prepare to be shocked as it can quickly turn against you causing a re-form and second attempt to take or hold ground you thought you owned.

I am a little annoyed with the AI and controls though. The movements are similar to the first game and i like that but the troop formations they auto adopt can leave themselves open to a flanking effect. Also i have noticed that within 2 seconds of getting flanked your troops instantly get the negative effects of it yet when i have a union brigade surrounded on 3 sides near enough they stand and take losses for 2 or 3 times as long before routing. Not exactly ideal as it makes the risk of out manoeuvring the AI too much at times because a small unit of skirmishers hidden in the woods can open up on you with a few shots and the FLANKED messages flashes for your troops.

Besides this and a couple other dumb AI moves like getting to the map edge and not being able to charge in the game is pretty solid, good challenge and a nice map system.

You can play individual historical battles or indulge in the game's campaign layer, allowing you to customize your army as you play through an 1861 - 1865 scenario. It is easiest to think of Ultimate General as the ACW Total War game that always should have happened, but never did. The dev behind this studio actually WAS a popular TW modder, which makes the comparison even stronger.

TLDR: Check out John Tiller series (turn-based) or Scourge of War (real-time) if you crave the most realistic wargames currently on the market, however Ultimate General does offer a fun, fast-paced, slightly more straightforward ""beer & pretzels"" (casual) experience, and even boasts a best-in-class campaign component if that's your thing.

Now, below I'm going to write about this game in much more detail, especially regarding some of the features I find most enjoyable in this genre and how it compares to other popular titles. I think you'll see that UG falls somewhere in the middle of the pack in terms of balancing authenticity and accessibility:

--------------------------------------------------

* AI commanders: This is probably my biggest wargaming pet peeve. With large Corps or Army level engagements, it becomes overwhelming to micro-manage all my forces. This ruins the fun for me in games like Civil War Generals 2 and the Hexwar titles. There's a lot to like with these games, but almost every scenario is tedious and overlong. Unfortunately, UG:CW is also in this vein, as it doesn't have any option to assign certain formations over to an AI general.

* Indirect orders: Despite the above, you do have the ability to issue ""extended"" orders to a unit, for example a long flanking maneuver where you trace the route of their march with your mouse. They will obey your orders instantly though, while you command with a ""God's eye"" view of the battlefield. One title very worth comparing here is Scourge of War (Gettysburg, Chancellorsville, Antietam), which allows a ""headquarters in the saddle"" option where you send couriers to deliver your orders, simulating the slowness of communications in the 1860's.

* Leader units: Leaders with command bonuses can really enhance tactical gameplay, not to mention add a ton of interesting context for further historical research. UG only gives you control of Corps commanders or higher (Lee, Jackson, etc.), which unfortunately ties it with Total War as the most obfuscated command structure of any comparable game. :(

* OOB: Maybe it's just the history nerd in me, but I like to browse the orders of battle, especially during combat. Unfortunately, UG only allows this before and after battle. Additionally, the ""opposing forces"" are presented in a confusing structure, at least for me, that represents Corps and Divisions for organizational purposes, even when it isn't historically accurate (1st Manassas, for example). There is another series of wargames called John Tiller Software's (JTS) Civil War Battles. They are turn-based and they aren't on Steam, but you can check out his website directly. The OOBs there are clean, historically accurate, and really easy to navigate.

* Detailed mechanics (morale, ammo, supply): Having these kind of mechanics are not necessarily good or bad, but just depend on your preferences. UG has all 3 features, although routed (fleeing) units have a strange tendency to recover too quickly and rejoin the fight unexpectedly. Of the games I've mentioned, JTS has the most in-depth options (and optional rulesets to tweak), whereas Hexwar has none of it at all. So again, UG is a middle-of-the-road option.

* Battles/campaigns: The more the better, of course, and hopefully with historically accurate detail. UG is actually pretty good here, compared to typical wargames which focus on major releases of single battles (more like UG: Gettysburg). This title includes many famous engagments like 1st Manassas, Shiloh, Antietam, Chickamauga, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. Still, it doesn't get any better than JTS in this regard, with 13 releases covering almost the entire war, including some key items missing from this title such as Jackson’s Valley campaign, Wilderness & Spotsylvania Courthouse (Overland campaign), and the Petersburg campaign. Not to mention John Tiller's scenario designers include painstakingly accurate historical detail in terms of the terrain, objectives, leaders, forces, etc.

* Campaign layer: UG excels in this area. It adds a strategy/campaign layer in which you gain money and skills as you fight your way through the ACW. You will be able to recruit your own officers, organize your brigades, and outfit your soldiers with the latest equipment. UG actually does it better than any other game I've listed so far (for most of the others this functionality is not available at all, although CWG2 does have shorter but comparable campaigns if that kind of gameplay interests you).

--------------------------------------------------

Hope this feedback helps. For my personal enjoyment, I really can't recommend the John Tiller series highly enough. The historical authenticity, flexible AI, numerous optional rulesets, detailed mechanics, and unparalleled number of engagements all combine to make JTS a near perfect option if you're looking for a tactical-level wargame covering the American Civil War.

Ultimate General is a good option too, though, especially for newer players. It's also much more affordable at $30 for the whole thing vs. $40 for *each* John Tiller game! If you're patient, you can even pick up UG on sale for ~ $10 a couple times a year.

At one point you can quickly win Gettysburg battle if you get all the objectives. Unit wise, they are the worse when use them badly and becoming the best when you use them correctly.

Since the updates of the patches have also improved some of the bugs within the gameplay. However, as some other players have commented, there is still a major issue within this game. I've played through the Union Campaign twice and rightly defeated the CSA, in cannon blazing glory, with efficient troops and income (as historically the Union did have the manpower and economic power which attrionally aided the defeat of the South). But as I've found out trying to play against the Union as the CSA. Time after time, I've won consecutive battles, like Shiloh, Gaines Mill and 2nd Bull Run. And still the Union returns to the next stage of the campaign en-masse, with troops and better weaponry. So, if I win a battle with heavy losses such as I did at Gettysburg, I dont get the income or manpower to replace rookie and veteran troops alike.

If the developers could make two style campaign, one more challenging such as a historical campaign which would more or less follow the route of the ACW, regards to manpower, economy etc. And then one which actually takes into account the outcome of your victory and defeats (as a few people have mentioned already!) So if you win battle after battle, you will have that incentive of more manpower and money. 

All in all, this is a great game. I've spent hours enjoying being tactful and just pure rash in making decisions which effect battles within the game. Once this final issue is polished, this game will stand the test of the time.

If anything i recommend now they move onto the ECW, or something like the 30 Years War.

As a strategy game about the Civil War it does an excellent job in the combat system, incorporating Civil War tactics with incredibly detailed maps that accurately depict the game. It also incorporates the ability to aquire historic generals to add to your army to boost its capabilities which is fantastic. Having officers be potienal casualties was a great touch (even if i loose a Major General when the brigade has only had 5 casualites >:(.  ) Those are just a few of the aspects of the game that I love. 

However there are some aspects of the game that are quite frustrating. For instance you quickly learn what units are worth getting and what are not. For instance the skirmishers are useful as scouts and little more late game. Therefore if you put them on the flank in hidden positions they can snipe the enemy but otherwise they are not very effective on the field. Infnatry units can send out their own flankers and skirmishers to scout and more or less can replace the Skirmishers so why get skirmishers? Also the artillery can be effective in supporting your units and will get many kills if you place them in the right position. It is clear that they help your infantry when you combine them and the infantry dont perform as well without them. However if you group up your artillery and barrage a positon I have found that you can rarely break a enemy positon with just artillery. For instance in Gettysburg or Fredricksburg if you fire all your cannon on an enemy positon they will still hold despite casualties. Why arent those barrages more effective? Lastly the way cavalry works in this game is incredibly infuriating. They do not have access to weapons in the game that give them range close to that of infantry so engaging with them is pointless wether your cavalry is mounted or dismounted. They are fast and great for scounting, but I have found they are only good for that and engaging exposed enemy artillery from the flanks or rear. The cavlary were used to great effect by both sides throughout the war but in this game they are pointless. I often only have at most 1 unit per full army corps. With a max size limit at 750 compared to the 2500 for infantry they cant even be used for counter charges to break enemy lines because they are so outnumbered that it is sending them to their death, unless an enmy infantry unit is fleeing and below 1000 strength, then they can be used to harrass or charge them. Unltimately the game tactics favor infantry formations and positions so heavily that it makes using cavalry or skirmisher tactics pointless and not worth the loss of life. Also often times the infantry can be in fortified possitions and flee after minimal casualties. At times the locations of fortified positions intentially put your troops where they will just take heavy losses and not hold the positions with the way the AI attack and it is annoying. You want to take the stronger position but he minute you place troops there they are slaughtered. The Confederate campaign on the highest difficulty is incredilby hard as well. Often times it is easier to play passive or defensive against the AI and take a loss at a battle in order to take fewer casualties and continue to expand the army (in a win I could loose 15k men and only be able to replace 10k while in a loss I could loose 5k and not only replace them but add to the army)

I would like to see this game expanded with more components to it. Make cavalry forces larger and give their weapons more range so they can actually be used. Can officers be promoted from within the unit itself, so if your Colonel dies possibly a young Lt proved himself and is made a captain you can assaign a unit? Or possibly add in other famous generals who started at lower ranks so you can have them throughout the campaign. Also it would be interesting to see these officers die in historically accuarate battles. As much as I love having Stonewall Jackson at Gettysburg, It would be interesting if we lost these generals at certain battles no matter what to spice up the campaign play. Id love an expansion on the economic and political aspects of the game so that you can produce better weapons or aquire allies as your successes continue. Including a way to make your own forticications would be great especially on maps like Fredricksburg where large portions of the line are not fortified and your men just stand in the open taking losses. I would also love an expansion to include a western campaign or splitting the army in two so you control one in the West and one in the East and can transfer troops between each depending on the need.

Ultimately I love the game and have played through many times. I would recommmend it to friends but I want more. While I have many complaints they are things I would love to see improved and released in a second game or expansion to this which I would buy in a heart beat.

I have always been fond of RTS, turn based strategy games, and resource management focused simulations. Heck just look at my library. I'm also a big Starcraft and old School Age Of Empires Fan and I am look forward to the new Bannerlord that is coming out in like never!!!

I freaking LOVE this game!!!

Ultimate General: Civil War is incredibly unique and does an excellent job of mimicking the American Civil War and introducing the conditions, army management, and brutal fighting and climbing casualties of the war. The art of the game is different, it feels like your units are running across a game board that has terrain. The gameplay is like none other and I tried to play it like Starcraft, being a twitchy strategist and constantly having my units hustle around and looking for that UNIQUE unit combo that is unbeatable. I could not find anything close and my army got demoralized, their condition was horrible and I was running out of resources, and I was the UNION!!! 

The attention to detail is incredible as well, heck as the UNION you occasionally fight STONEWALL JACKSON, and if you know anything about this guy he was known for his FOOT CAVALRY. Basically his infantry brigades were damn fast and commonly outflanked their opponents, he'll do the same to you. The A.I. is awesome, has a few shortcomings but overall its good. Example is STONEWALL JACKSON and his foot cavalry or ROBERT E LEE and his overly AGGRESSIVE pushes that eventually break you.

There is a multiplayer aspect but your mainly fighting at Bull Run, Antiem, Fredricksburg, or some side raid. Its just campaign missions but instead of playing against AI your playing against another player

One of the most engrossing strategy games I have ever experienced.

The first time I played the battle of Antietam I was physically fatigued by the end! Purely as a general or soldier I felt some insight into how Robert E Lee must have perceived a battlefield.

No matter how much my boys outfight them that remorseless blue wave just keeps coming and every able soldier lost cannot be replaced. To slowly realise that it is the Iron brigade heading for my weakened flank. Hard choice after hard choice.

The core element of this game, the tactical battles, are impressive from top to bottom you can practically smell the gunpowder. I only wish the rebels gave their distinct yell on the charge!

This game creates an excellent atmosphere, with some footage from Ken Burns civil war spliced in and a bit more dialogue like at the general creation screen this game could assail even loftier heights. Echoes of the sense of purpose the close combat a bridge too far had could have been achieved.

The strategic layer is clearly the weaker aspect of this game but building and customising your army and units was an essential element of the fun. My army never felt faceless or disposable. Battles fought with my own army scrapped together with whatever was available were always more satisfying to fight with than pre-generated units. 

Perhaps it is the high bar set by some of the larger battles where there is a 'branching story' depending on what actions and how successful you are in claiming objectives that may have added to some peoples disappointment with the strategy layer as winning a stunning victory or a crushing defeat has much less of an impact than perhaps it feels it should.

I appreciate the heroism, bloodiness and protracted nature of this conflict in a way I did not previously. I can only hope that a sequel (that would revisit and expand on the same war) will be able to have some of the extra bells and whistles above that would better connect events to the history.

The results are pretty much what you would expect and makes for, in my opinion, one of the greatest real time strategy games of the last decade. 

The brilliance of this game and its predecessor, UG:Gettysburg is that it goes to such great lengths to portray the warfare of the period in as plausible a manner as possible. In the Civil War, overall casualties in individual battles were fairly low (the Battle of Stones River, which had the highest proportionate casualties of the war, ended with no more than about 35% dead and wounded) and the ability of mass-produced rifle muskets to repulse massed infantry charges meant that battles were generally fought at a distance, with the decisive infantry charges that were common even 20 years prior in the Mexican-American War almost non-existent. Both sides, moreover, fought the war with massive numbers of inexperienced volunteer regiments, generally led by commanders with little to no battlefield experience who were forced to develop their skills in the field.

In UG:Civil War, in other words, the name of the game is as much outmaneuvering your opponents (made possible by your ability to draw movement commands for selected units on the terrain) as it is inflicting casualties, managing the limited conditioning and morale of your troops, and protecting your experienced units while slowly developing raw recruits into battle-hardened veterans over the course of several campaigns.

The game shines brightest during the battles themselves. The design of the battles are brilliantly detailed and make you feel as though you're looking at the battle unfold as the original commanders might have 150 years ago. The overarching campaign mode is somewhat weaker than the battles themselves, and serves mainly to connect your results in previous battles to the resources available to you in subsequent campaigns. Units are persistent throughout the campaign unless they are destroyed, and it is fun to raise and customize your troops and their equipment, and satisfying to see units which were raw recruits in April 1861 become seasoned veterans by July 1863.

Even still, the consequences of your results in the campaign's battles feel somewhat limited. Even if you are somehow able to rout Lee's Army of Northern Virginia as the Union in the Battles of Gaines Mill and Malvern Hill (the decisive battles which ended the Union's advance on Richmond in the Peninsula Campaign and established Lee as the South's premier general), you somehow still end up on the defensive in the 2nd Battle of Bull Run and Antietam, battles which never would have happened if the Peninsula campaign was successful. The *strategic* implications of your victories are practically nil, represented abstractly only by improved conditioning and access to equipment for your troops and reduced manpower for the enemy in future battles. There is probably nothing that the game's designers could have done to address this without overwhelming the player and making the campaign mode too complex and time-consuming to make, but there is still a bit of an odd disconnect between the historical accuracy of the battles and the more abstract campaign mode in which they are presented to the player.

As varied as the selection of battles is in the game, I also feel as though there were some significant oversights. Sieges such as Vicksburg and Petersburg are not represented in the game (the latter is replaced by a fictionalized decisive assault on Richmond,) and the Battle of Missionary Ridge, arguably the decisive battle of the entire Western Theater, is also absent. The Western Theater of the war in general is somewhat under-represented.

But these are all minor complaints in comparison to everything this game gets right. This game is a real achievement, a much-needed jolt in the arm for a real time strategy genre which has been generally saddled by shallow gameplay and obsolete mechanics developed for the most part in the early 1990s. I can't wait to see what the developers' have in store next.

What about choosing what to equip them with? How to name them? Remember the Stonewall Brigade? What kind of names might you come up with? Those are the kinds of things that make this game incredibly awesome.

I just fought Antietam. With the feared Death Hands division, equipped with the latest and greatest infantry rifles, I held down the river crossing from a fierce Confederate counterattack. My 2000 infantry killed 1700 and captured more than 900 Rebels. Another, as yet undistinguished division, commanded by a William Baxter, Lt. Colonel, marched into the teeth of another Rebel counterattack on my right flank to shore up a hole in the line, protecting my artillery from a melee bout that may have sunk that part of the battle. For marching into the open field, with no cover, under cannon fire, to inflct fearsome casualties on two Confederate divisions, they achieved a nickname. Not sure what I'll call them yet. But these are the kind of amazing moments that happen in this game every single battle. 

The campaign is so awesome, too. You fight side battles that help you gain money/reputation to spend, use that to equip and expand your army for the ""Grand battles"" like Antietam, Shiloh, 2nd Bull Run, etc. The major battles have multiple parts to them that keep you on your toes even when you think you may have the upper hand. You've got to be willing to change your plan on the fly if you want to adapt to emerging situations. It's a fun, challenging game. 

The only real downside here is there is very little ability to play in small portions--you'll forget what you're doing. Clear your calendar for a good 2-4 hour chunk at a time, though, and this game is awesome.

Cons:
 - There are still a few counterintuitive mechanics regarding optimum unit size, but you can learn to avoid the pitfalls by spending 5 minutes reading up on the forums.
 - Don't expect to avoid micromanagement. Units will suicide if you dont keep an eye on them. Your skirmishers will happily charge the entire enemy army if they  lose their line of fire to the target you gave them, or ignore enemies who are murdering them with flanking fire.

SUMMARY: Ultimate General: Civil War is a very good historical real-time strategy game that is tactically deep (great pitched battles) and possesses a simple but enjoyable strategy layer (campaign+army management). Be aware: The learning curve is steep and the first few battles are difficult. This game has allowed me to enjoy two very long campaigns (Union and CSA) over many months by fighting small battles and managing the army during the week, and then fighting “grand battles” on weekends. If you enjoyed Napoleon Total War but wanted a larger scale and challenging experience that makes you earn your victory, then you will enjoy this game.

THE BATTLES: 75% of UG:CW is spent in pause-able, scripted, timed battles on a large tactical map with victory point objectives. Many minor battles can be completed in 30-60 minutes, but the grand battles like Gettysburg or Chickamauga can take hours. Planning, positioning, and timing are the keys to victory in this game, not rapid clicking and uncoordinated charges that will only get your men killed. Some of the grand battles, like Shiloh, require you to fight intense delaying actions against superior forces so your main body can fall back and get into defensive positions. In other battles, tactics like strategy of central position and encirclement are very effective and satisfying. Brute force is still an option on lower difficulty levels and is downright necessary to take some positions (Cemetery Hill, Nashville Pike), but the cost in men and equipment will be terrible. Grand battle maps can be huge and you may end up fighting several chaotic engagements simultaneously on different sections of the map (example: Fredericksburg). Use of screening forces for flanking, scouting, and raiding behind enemy lines is also really effective and one of the most enjoyable aspects of these grand battles.

The AI in this game is above average (better than N:TW) and will aggressively attack weak points in your defensive lines, protect its artillery, and can still punch you in the face after 100+ hours in game (example: My 7,500 man assault on the Brotherton Road victory point that was counter-attacked by about 15,000 Union infantry waiting in the tree line… “FALLLBAAAACK!”).

THE CAMPAIGN: The campaign could be described as “lite” and consists of 30+ mostly historical battles on pre-made (but beautiful) maps using your customized army. The campaigns are divided into chapters that include 1-3 minor battles for training up your troops, gaining loot, and inflicting casualties before the grand battle that leads to the next chapter. Some battle outcomes lightly affect AI manpower in later battles, but you are able to skip the small battles and go straight to the big fights if you don’t want to take the casualties and can forego the career points. The real meat of the strategic layer is the army management. 

ARMY MANAGEMENT: Create and rename brigades, reinforce, equip soldiers with bought or captured weapons, and re-assign promoted officers. Each unit gains experience from combat that gradually increases its stats and unlocks perks as they level up (example: 50% more ammo for artillery brigades at 1-star). Army corps generals confer passive perks to all units under their command (example +5% speed), while divisional and brigade commanders affect how the unit performs in combat. All of the battles have caps on the quantity of brigades that can be deployed during combat and many feed reinforcements into battle piecemeal (example: Chickamauga), so your army composition and organization are VERY important for effective combat. Victories also allow leveling up of some strategic “career” perks (example: lower equipment costs) using a point system.

ISSUES: UG:CW is not a perfect game and has some widely discussed issues that you may or may NOT find to be a problem. The most discussed topic is “scaling”of the AI Army: As you grow your brigades from 500 to 2,500 men, the AI will usually (not always) deploy larger brigades, especially on higher difficulty levels. There are ways to mitigate scaling that don’t include cheating, but many people dislike the feature. Other debated issues include the nerfed gun ranges and surrender mechanics, ineffective cavalry, a lack of custom unit groupings (example CTRL+1 for ad hoc divisions), a lack of friendly fire mechanics, and how scripting will roll back your gains in some of the grand battles. In my experience, these haven’t been a problem if I was aware of them in advance (by watching YouTube).

TIPS FOR NEW GENERALS

1)	First Campaign: Choose the Union on Colonel difficulty. This game is hard and the first couple missions are difficult even for a Napoleon: Total War veteran. CSA is more fun.

2)	Career Points: The most important skills are (in order) Politics, Training, Medicine, Economy, Army Organization, Logistics, and then Reconnaissance. 

3)	First Perks for Units: Infantry = Discipline, Artillery = Logistics, Cavalry = Horseback, Skirmishers = Endurance.

4)	Victory Conditions: Check the conditions when the battle starts. “Hold” means you will need to have control of the objective for a “contested” amount of time (45-60 game clock minutes) before it is considered captured. If the battle timer reaches zero but an area is still “contested,” the battle will continue in overtime. “Capture” of an objective means you only have to control the area when the battle timer reaches zero.

5)	Skirmishers: NEVER use dedicated skirmisher brigades and instead use detached skirmishers for scouting, flanking actions, capturing supplies, and especially taking out artillery behind the main enemy line.

6)	Cavalry: Melee Cavalry and Mounted Infantry is situationally effective for raiding behind enemy lines to steal supplies, taking out unsupported artillery and skirmishers in the open, and chasing down isolated routing infantry. Cavalry is fragile and will take huge/expensive casualties if it runs into a full-morale enemy infantry brigade.

7)	Artillery and Tactics: The best artillery pieces are the 12lb. Napoleon’s for close range and the 10lb. Ordnance for medium range. Phase in 24lb. Howitzer’s and 20lb. Parrot’s as they become available. Sell everything else. There is an excellent “Artillerist’s Guide to Ultimate General: Civil War” by user The Soldier on Steam.

8)	Command Skill and Efficiency: A unit’s Efficiency value represents the brigade’s potential reload speed and potential damage per volley. Actual reload speed and damage are also affected by the weapon equipped. However, the efficiency value will be capped by the Command value for the unit, which comes from the brigade commander AND the divisional commander’s rank and experience (but not the Corps commander). This means that your 3-star, 12-gun artillery brigade with a displayed efficiency value of 89, but a command value of 58 from Lt. Colonel N00b, will perform like it has an efficiency value of 58 (much slower reload, less damage per volley). This is why it’s important to assign high-ranking officers to directly command elite brigade.

9)	Optimal Unit Size: Efficiency is also negatively affected by unit size. Keep your infantry brigades at 1,500 men, cavalry and skirmishers at 500 men, and artillery at 12-guns for optimal killing power and to mitigate scaling.

10)	AI Scaling: The game uses your average brigade size to determine an appropriate AI scaled brigade size. Avoid making big 2,500 man 1-star infantry brigades that trigger 3,000 man AI brigades. Use smaller, elite, and better equipped units instead.

11)	Defenses/Cover: Avoid using fixed defensive positions (little shield icons). Instead, keep your brigades in their column formation in trees, fields, and buildings where cover is better. Whenever possible, engage enemy troops while they are moving through an open field while your soldiers have good cover.",1549036101,1549036232,True,71,0,0.865560948848724365,3,True,False,False

Low Down: You have the main battles which test your tactical prowess but between battles you have to refit and reinforce your army as you see fit, upgrading weapons, promoting commanders and units, and selling captured or outdated munitions.

You can choose ""minor"" skirmishes between fights to improve your chances in the big battles, and as you progress you earn career points which allow you to fill out the type of army you want to field.

Cons: The only real downside is if you pick up a serious head of steam and start winning some battles early on by a significant margin it will make the final battles easier/too easy, but still, seeing 1,000+ rebs behind a trenchwork is enough to make you think twice!

No cheesy tricks needed like in all Total War games where you have to send cavalry all over the map and send half the enemy army on a wild goose chase. No more skirmishers and archers who manage to stay just out of reach for an entire battle.

The combat has real weight to it - you know when you send in your best riflemen, they will inflict damage before giving up, even if outnumbered. You know having your general nearby helps. You can actually see the effect that bringing in artillery or a mobile unit like skirmishers can have on a fight. Whereas in Total War fights just eventually result in a chaotic mess where you just have to throw your hands up and hope for the best, in Ultimate General you actually feel like you've accomplished something in winning a tough fight.

The enemy can summon men out of thin air, I don´t know how to otherwise describe where he is getting his men from. You can beat them in every mission and inflict three times the casualties and he will still have more men in the next fight. Actually you need to inflict three times the casualties since that is also the factor of man he will send against you. The AI only manages to be a threat since it has a lot more man than you, and can only be beaten despite of that because those men stand out in the open and let themself be slaughtered. It´s fun to watch the numbers go down and feel like you outsmart someone, but past a certain point it loses it´s charm.

And that point was shiloh in my second campaign playthrough playing as the south. After beating the enemy completely, eradicating over 2/3rds of the enemy, I managed to conquer the final fortification. Took some heavy loses, but managed to dislocate their artillery. So then I just had to finish the mission and... 2nd day. What? Why didn´t I win? Turns out some enemy routed through my lines earlier and snuck to one of the earlier victory points. I had forgoten about them because I thought my 750 man cavalery unit had eradicated the enemy 250 skrimishers with their charge. They aparently did not. So because some 200 man managed to sneak into a camp my whole army got set back, the enemy was for some reason allowed to retake his position behind the fortifications AND received more reinforcments than I had men to begin with. Also my men were now out of ammo, which means I had no means to fight their fresh troops. So all in all either restart the whole first day or stop playing right there. Even if I managed to win that somehow, my army would have been so low that the campaign was lost. Did I mention that I had a whole second army I wasn´t allow to bring because that specific battle only allows for one of your armies, even though there was a lot of space for battalions inside that army, which I couldn´t fill because of ""organisation"", which is a character trait you MUST level up or lose the campaign at some point.

-Should be an easy Grand Battle, becuase the rebs won it easy in real life (RIP Irish Brigade)
-I have all victories and 1 draw in all previous campaign skirmishes and Grand Battles so I've been pretty successful so far
-Get to battle deployment and see what the layout will be
-standard 3 corps main line and like 2 reserve corps options for deployment
-I only have 3 corps and have never had more (screw you for not giving me more money I can barely manage 2 corps)
-My 1st corps, which is my best and has my most veteran units has a the max 4 divisions 
-My 2nd corps, kind of just there, has some decent units but I usually take the good ones and put them in my 1st corps. It has like 15 regiments
-My 3rd corps hasn't existed very long and has always been incredibly small and only has like 1 division.
-HOW THE HECK AM I SUPPOSED TO HAVE 3 FULL SIZED CORPS AND 2 MORE FOR RESERVE
-THATS LIKE 125 REGIMENTS, I ONLY HAVE LIKE 45
-I move some divisions around to try and even out each corps. Put the 1st corps on the left becuase obviously thats where the most famous historic fighting took place at the stone wall and all that.
-2nd corps goes to the middle, I gave like half of it's divisions to the 3rd corps which I put on the right, becuase the middle was not expected to be attacked heavily.
-3rd corps got beefed a little bit, becuase it was expected to be atacked, but most of the regiments have freaking smoothbore farmer muskets and are basically just there to hold the strategic point and die. 
-I don't expect the right to be very challenging because I have a large entrenched line with good artillery support and lots of cover everywhere.
-SIKE
-Union goes sicko mode and throws everything at me, as well as takes advantage of the incredibly large amount of space around my flanks that I can't cover and sends whatever else they have around my sides. I have to scramble my like 3 spare regiments to the flanks to try and stop their like 6 regiments plus 3 cavalry regiments. I try and slowly scoot my units closer together because I can't fight all these dang yanks over here.
-Thankfully, the battle switches to the left flank right as I'm about to get massacred on the right.
-That wasn't going well but I'll wreck them on this stone wall. 
-CORRECT, the Union are retarded and they hardly even try to break my hold on the left flank. They try like 4 times to uproot me with a bayonet charge, but I easily fill gaps and run them back. Yankees just sit in Fredricksburg and blast me with artillery, but basically do nothing with their infantry. 
-Battle switches to the center, I may have made a mistake by reducing the 2nd corps like only like 1 division, but we'll see how it goes. 
-Union sends 1 regiment against my entire entrenched division in the center. some of my regiments dont even fire a shot or take losses.
-I win on the left flank and the map switches to just the center and right. I can handle this.....
-Union magically teleports a regiment behind my center forces and takes the strategic point.
-THERE WASN'T EVEN SPACE FOR THEM TO SNEAK AROUND ME WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?!?!?!?!? 
-I divert 2 regiments, whip those union boys that thought they were slick, and retake the point, EZ PZ
-The right flank was holding ok while I did this, but now I can focus on it again
-I am basically getting encircled on the right flank at this point and its a last stand against Union until the timer runs out (WHICH GOES INCREDIBLY SLOW)
-All my regiments have been fully engaged from the start and the casualties are starting to be noticable. The union keeps pouring in fresh regiments with like 1200 men against my worn down regminets with like 600 
-RUN
-Pull everyone back into a tight circle, yanks are incredibly close to the strategic point and they keep piling more troops in. -Some of my regiments get scary low on manpower (like 100-200 men)
-They puncture my line right next to the point 
-FRIG
-*REBEL YELL* 
-Run all my units into a giant blob around the strategic point
-Some regiments literally take 100% casualties and cease to exist
-Everyone routes (cowards)
-Union takes the freaking point
-I mad rush my last like 5 regiments at them
-Route in .5 seconds
-Everyone is dead or fled
-I have only my corps commander (usesless) a cavalry regiment (I hate cavalry they always run), and 2 dead regiments
-Send commander and cav away becuase theres no fight left here
-last 2 regiments get smacked by the full force of the Union but somehow manage to run 
-Well, I tried
-VICTORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-THERE WERE 2 VICTORY CONDITIONS INSTEAD OF JUST 1 AND I DID IT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
-I GET REWARDED WITH A MEDAL AND A TON OF MONEY AND THOUSANDS OF MUSKETS
-Replenish my battered corps
-Give them all better weapons
-Run out of money

It constantly changes the location of objectives that you have to hold in order to fit with the historical events, rather than what is actually happening on the field. Successfully defend an objective against an onslaught of enemies? Guess what! They weren't meant to be defeated, and you have to fall back from your well-organized defensive perimeter anyway because that's what happened in real life. The objective moves a mile or so  behind your lines and the enemy AI sneaks one cavalry unit to the point and you lose. Basically it's as if you were playing chess, but every 5 or 10 turns, your king swaps places with another piece, causing you to potentially lose the game almost instantly at no fault of your own. It's an awful mechanic that rewards metagaming over tactical skill. Moreover, enemies almost always vastly outnumber your own men and most missions devolve quickly into heroic last stands while you wait for the game to give you the second half of your army. On subsequent playthroughs, most levels are significantly easier, as enemies spawn in the same location and you can arrange your forces to best defend against the enemy's formation that your character has no way of knowing.

The objectives in general are just garbage. If the enemy bum rushes (which they can almost always do, since nearly every scenario presents as hordes of enemies rushing your very limited number of men), they can typically route units you have defending the point, and it can be impossible to take it back with in the arbitrary 10-30 game minute deadline. Pretty much every battle I lost saw my army absolutely dominating the opposition, clearly capable of taking back the objective if given time to whittle down the enemy's suicidal mob, but each time, Abe Lincoln apparently descended down from the skies and told the troops to pack it up and leave because allowing the enemy to hold a random hill for 21 minutes is apparently just unacceptable, and we should have opted to lose 1000 guys in a suicide charge to ""take the objective back"" for 10 seconds before re-losing it immediately, just for the sake of resetting the timer. 

If there were no timers, the objectives would be a reasonably ok system. For example, yes game, I do agree that I have to hold the landing area to get reinforcements at the Battle of Shiloh. But if the boats aren't arriving for six hours, what difference does it make if an enemy cavalry is standing in the landing zone for 25 minutes somewhere in there? The game constantly justifies its timers using various threats. Like, ""take X hill in the next hour, because enemy reinforcements are going to get there and improve their defenses, and then taking it will be really hard!"" Ok, sure that makes sense, but why insta-fail the scenario if it's not done in time? Why not just send the reinforcements in and make the objective really difficult to take? Rather than this artificial, immersion-shattering, game-destroying instant failure.
Any timers should be counting down to the AI getting some sort of situationally-relevant tactical advantage (most of which are already stated -but not implemented - in the game!), 

Many times timers are on the player's side as well. Most defensive objectives involve letting the clock tick down a couple hours, at which point you click ""Finish"" even if the battle would realistically rage on for several more hours. And the enemy just... leaves I guess? Even if they were winning? If you don't like winning the scenarios by virtue of not losing before the timer runs out, you can always decide to keep fighting to see if you end up winning in the end. But the objective can still be taken by the AI during this time and you can still lose. Additionally, damage done to enemies during each battle doesn't affect later battles, while damage your troops take will have to be replaced in your own army, so the mechanics strongly encourage you to end missions as soon as possible even if it makes no sense. God forbid you have the urge to play things out to a conclusive end.

Artillery in this game is horribly unbalanced as well. At the end of a day-long battle, they should have more than 150 kills, regardless of whether I put them at their exact optimal range. Luckily, the AI cannons are also trash. You can safely ignore most any artillery bombardment and only lose a small percentage of your men. Most cannons cost far more than they are worth, while infantry-only armies seem to be a distressingly viable composition. You can do at least as well using only armies composed entirely of 1500 man infantry units and buying better rifles using the money that would have been spent on cannons. While the killing power of artillery used correctly may be larger, infantry are the only units that can stop a determined enemy advance, and hiring as many as you can is the only real way to close the manpower gap against the AI. The only drawback is that their feet start to hurt after maybe a quarter mile of running, so they can't always make it to changing objectives before enemy cavalry. 

The controls are a bit wonky as well. Left click and drag to box select multiple units at once. But be careful, because if you click a unit instead of the ground, it draws a path for that unit to walk down. This is the only movement control bound to left mouse. All others are on the right side. And what's more, right clicking on a unit and dragging doesn't do anything at all! Why not have that to control path drawing?? And you'd better get used to moving the camera using middle mouse, because something about moving the camera with WASD just confuses the hell out of all your units.

Overall, the game is reasonably fun until you realize that it doesn't really want you to play it. It wants you to follow a specific sequence of events and troop movements every single time, and if you deviate from that sequence too much, you're wrong and you lose.

Tactics are true to the era and the money, political points and upgrade system for veteran soldiers, general, divisions and equipment makes the game feel fresh and vibrant and unique compared to other games that deal with the civil war.  

If the game had a weakness, it would be that it punishes you too much for losing a battle, when you have been winning 90% of all your battles before.  This does not seem realistic to me as you would not fire a general that wins 80-90% of the battles he fights.  

Ignore the haters.  Some people complain that the game AI cheats. I don't believe so.  I have played and seen the AI makes mistakes and it's weakness is in not protecting the flanks at times.  People also complain about skirmishers and cavalry feeling useless. Again, in this era, cavalry are NOT the dominant factor in warfare. They are great at scouting, flanking and running down cannons.  Do't expect cavalry to be able to take on 2000 man brigades alone!  If I had to agree with some, I would say that the skirmishers/sharpshooters can feel underwhelming but not useless

The campaign is the highlight of the game, in which you make a custom general and lead either Union or Confederate forces through a series of historical theaters and battles, from Bull Run to Cold Harbor. Over the course of those battles, the player manages the strategic layer and tactical layers that do a good job of showcasing the American Civil War era.

The strategic layer requires managing manpower, equipment, officers, and the organization of one's army. Overall, this is well done; captured weapons can be assigned to units, and the efficiency of one's units is relative to the officer commanding the unit. Meaningful choices are made over the course of the war, and balancing manpower and money is a constant struggle.

The tactical layer is where the player will see most of the action of the game. The choices made in the strategic layer will be put in to practice as the player manages infantry, cavalary, artillery, and skirmishers. These four unit types all fulfilly unique roles on the battle field; while it may be hard to use some of them effectively, early on, they're all critical to victory.

Graphically, the game is quite beautiful, and evocative. Smoke covers the battlefield, craters leave marks on the ground, and fallen soldiers lay where they were wounded. The environments are really quite beautiful. The sound production is equally evocative, as the opening volleys ring out across the battlefield or in the distance.

The game fails primarily in how battles are scripted; you can utterly dominate enemy forces, but find yourself forced to retreat by the end of the day to a more historically accurate position. It's frustrating to utterly dominate the Battle of Shenandoah as the Union, and then have to fight your way forward from the last line of defense the next day.

[h1]Pros [/h1]

    [*] I absolutely love the focus on leaders. It is disturbing how many games about war, even those claiming to be “realistic, historically accurate” etc, completely ignore this most crucial and decisive element of warfare – leaders. This game has leaders, mostly based on history, ranked from lowly captains to generals, who are in command of every brigade, division and corps as per their ranks. They can be hired, fired, killed, wounded, replaced. They gain experience over battles, get promoted, and learn skills that improve their commanded units.
   [*] The game has a relatively more realistic order of battle, compared to generic RTS games or the likes of Total War. Your army is made up of corps, which are broken up into divisions, each of which are made up for brigades. As you progress through the campaign, you can create more corps and increase the size of your divisions and brigades.
   [*] Recruiting, organizing and equipping your army is an absolute joy as far as I am concerned. There are plenty of weapon types, broken up into four main categories – infantry, skirmishers, cavalry, canons. Each category has further options, letting you choose weapons that focus on range, or firing rate, or melee. As the campaign progresses, you will get access to more modern weapons. You can also loot weapons from your enemies. 
   [*] The pacing and tactics are a lot more satisfying than Total War. The game encourages you to play methodically as opposed to a mad orgy of clicks like a generic RTS or recent Total War games. You rely on positioning, maneuverers, terrain etc. The style is quite close to tactical wargames such as Command Ops or Scourge of War. I wish they had gone even further in that direction, but I guess that would too much for some of the target audience.
   [*] Army sizes and casualties are realistic.
   [*] The visuals are nice enough, especially given the scale and performance.
   [*] Tactical factors such as cover, terrain, flanking etc. have visible, if sometimes inaccurate, effect on the battles.
   [*] You need to manage your supplies in battles, which is refreshing. You can even capture enemy supplies and divert them your way.
   [*] The brigades become organically more proficient in different aspects of combat through participation. E.g. marching a lot will improve their movement. This is realistic, and rarely seen in games like this. 
   [*] There are quality of life features such as tactical pause, comprehensive save / load system, and difficulty settings etc, which for some strange reason, have become too much to ask for some indie developers these days.
   [*] There is a basic chain of command system, which, again, is a welcome feature in games like this, yet is somehow ignored by most developers. In theory, it should allow you to leave mundane tasks to AI commanders, according to your order of battle, making you free to focus on parts of the battle that interests you. This enables a game to add much larger army organizations without a fear of overwhelming the player. It is also a lot more realistic, as you truly play the role of commander, as opposed to some nonsensical hivemind entity controlling every move of your entire army as seen in Total War or generic RTS games. This game gets points for including this, but the system is not fully realized. More on that later.

Instead they are attached to one random regiment under them. You have no control over their fates and positions, and thus fail to make the best use of them.  
    [*] Asking multiple brigades to move often leads to the brigades unnecessarily switching positions and getting flanked.
    [*] The game would sometimes inaccurately calculate flanking and line of fire (e.g. blocking).
    [*] You will experience abrupt unrealistic stoppages due to the timer system as the game will force you to move to the next phase, right in the middle of an ongoing battle, or while you are executing a brilliant tactical manoeuvre. Unit's positions will be reset. I find this to be quite jarring, unnatural, and unsatisfactory. 
    [*] Often times you will have very little strategic control over battles. Your corps and divisions will be taken away for fake challenge. Sometimes the game will randomly assign units from your corps leaving out cavalry, artillery or skirmishers that might have provided more tactical variety. I hope that in future games, the player would be in complete strategic control of the extended battlefield. If some of troops need to be on some hill or guarding a flank to prevent an enemy attack, it should be the player's choice which divisions to put there.
    [*] You also can not reduce the size of brigades for some strange reason. Say your elite brigade as 2500 troops. You just purchased 2000 high-end rifles. Ideally you should be able to reduce the brigade to 2000 and give them those new rifles, but it is not possible here.
    [*] The game lacks realistic tactical commands such as ""advance at all costs"", ""advance until resistance"", ""recon"", ""avoid engagement"", ""tactical retreat"" etc from other tactical wargames. It will so happen that your units may keep moving forward like idiots despite discovering overwhelming resistance. Some units like skirmishers have hardcoded behaviour which can play havoc on your tactics as they will run back after a single volley instead of decimating an enemy flank as commanded.
    [*] You can give overall commands to larger organizational groups and let the AI do the micromanaging instead of you. But this AI is very unreliable, and often seems much worse than the enemy AI. The traits or rank of the general you assign these commands to seem to have no effect on its behaviour. You are better off doing everything on your own.
    [*] Commanders are more or less indistinguishable, other than the rank, name and portrait. They have no affinities to certain troop types or unique traits. Look at Romance of the Three Kingdoms or AGEOD for how to properly implement characters.
    [*] Corps and division commanders gain xp in a glacial speed. In my entire campaign, I do not think I ever saw a division commander reach the next rank. 
    [*] Battles often follow a pre-set path no matter how you perform in the early phases. For instance, due to the overwhelming damage I caused to the Confederates in my Gettysburg battle, the great scripted Confederate charge during the final phases only had 4000 men against my 100,000. It makes no sense. Large battles should be more dynamic, with branching paths, so that later phases can correspond to the outcomes of the earlier ones.",1547714424,1547715762,True,7,0,0.591081678867340088,0,True,False,False

Strategically, the game is a complete failure.  It doesn't matter HOW successful you are or aren't, the game proceeds in more or less lockstep fashion.  You will fight the main battles of the Civil War, in the same order.  Even if you destroy the enemy in one battle, they will miraculously be reborn in the next, fighting you on the same historical battlefiends.

Once you realize this, and play through a number of battles, the game loses much of its appeal - particularly given the fact that it has only limited replayabiliy, because you are playing through the same battles, the same way, over and over.  If you had hoped for strategic flexibility to see what would happen if you did something different, you will be sadly disappointed.

Pros;

Fun
AI is intelligent (at least from my experience). Enemy cavalry will try to exploit any gap in your line to take potshots at you from the rear and threaten your supply wagons.
The battles feel authentic; units with better weapons and cover will easily survive a battle where the same unit with lower quality weapons and no/little cover would not. Especially useful for skirmishers.
Civil War... students... will probably enjoy this.

Cons; 
History remains the same (unless you play the Confederacy, with a battle for Washington DC put at the end of their campaign). Doesn't matter how well you fight during Antietam as the Union, somehow Lee and his army are back for Fredericksburg.

In short, I like this game, but the game would, in my opinion, be so much better with alternate history scenarios for both sides; If I win the battle of Fredericksburg as the Union (somehow), why not have a campaign for Richmond in place of the Chancellorsville, with a series of minor battles and fictional major battles?

Have I been too tough on Ultimate General: Civil War? In spite of everything I've said, I don't hate Civil War. Rather, I expected too much, hoped for fifteen battles with the scope of Ultimate General: Gettysburg, anticipated improvements. Instead the developers delivered a dull, repetitive, tiresome campaign, when they would have better served their customers by offering another single battle: Chancellorsville, Antietam, or Shiloh, with improvements.

The problems with Civil War are many, some a feature of the new systems the developers added, while others due to alterations implemented. A few developments proved worthwhile, but on the whole, the game suffered. Of all the alterations and additions, two seem particularity worthy of reiteration for the agony they caused.

In Gettysburg, every section is a series of choices, of which victory points to secure, and which to relinquish, and every section is concluded with a choice; advance or defend. Civil War is full of false choices, like which named and faced, but totally irrelevant commander would you prefer to hire.

Ultimate General: Civil War is a play, which pretends to grant the player the part of General Robert E. Lee, when it really forces them into the role of Maj. General George Pickett.

This title builds upon its predecessor, Ultimate General: Gettysburg, and expands its focus from one battle (Gettysburg) to the entire war, featuring many of the most famous battles of the conflict (as well as several other fictional battles and smaller skirmishes).

The principle feature of the game is the campaign.  In the campaign, players will take on the role of a fictional Union or Confederate general, fighting battles and using the spoils to build more elaborate armies to fight battles on a larger and larger scale as the war escalates.  The meta-game of building your army and assigning equipment is reminiscent of the Panzer General/Fantasy General series from the mid 1990's (there was a Civil War General game in the same vein but I don't recall it nearly as well), while the battles themselves are played in a pausable real-time tactical interface that any RTS or Total War player will find instantly familiar.

The battles strike an excellent balance between abstraction and realism:  players must contend with supplies and ammunition, positioning of troops/artillery, morale, maneuvering and scouting with skirmishers/cavalry, and terrain without having to micromanage units' lines of sight or specific behaviors too intensely.  Even large battles are generally managable (though you do have the option of assigning divisions or corps to AI command with general instructions) and satisfying to command.  

The goal of battles is usually to try and hold (or take) specific positions on a battlefield within a certain window of time, but there are a very wide array of tactics that one can use to do this depending on your army composition choices.  For example, if you must take a fortified hill, you could bombard with artillery and overwhelm with waves of infantry.  Or, perhaps you could use skirmishers and sharpshooters to wear down the morale and numbers of the defenders before charging in from an unexpected direction with cavalry.  Or, use your cavalry to steal the enemy's supplies and move in once the enemy have exhauseted their ammunition...or a combination of all three!

The AI is good enough to block flanking maneuvers (as well as attempt some itself) and reactive enough to make a feint tactic worthwhile, but not foolproof.  That said, the AI does tend to emphasize infantry charges a bit more than would likely be efficient (but I guess that's not entirely inaccurate for the Confederacy, anyway).  The tactical battles in this game are quite satisfying, and conducting your maneuvers just right to steal enemy supplies or encircle an enemy infantry unit is a great feeling.

The campaign does a good job of tieing all of the battles together, and inflicting heavy casualties on your enemies/capturing their supplies can greatly help you/harm them in the long run of the war (even though all battles play out in their historical order regardless of what happens in the battles).

Overall, this game offers a great and varied tactical wargaming experience at a very modest price.  I highly recommend it.

But when I am in that situation my troops “Route” and immediately need running down by my General.

I would very much like to be able to control/have units with a larger size. When I get reinforcements from other Generals, they number over 3000 sometimes, but I can’t grab anything more than 2500. 

Even with these, I still will continue to play and enjoy my time. I even got a friend into it, who now has a lot of time in as well.",1545611526,1545611526,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Do not get me wrong its not so bad but it just has too many flaws. At first when I was at the early acces i liked the game and felt like it got into me hard and made me think but as it went on I noticed how badly balanced it was as to how the enemies got so many troops I still wonder how I won. For example: The battle of 2 Bull Run. I had to fight against 66 thousands soldiers with 28 thousand men where about half of it were inexperienced because I had no money left from always just reinforcing my experienced troops. After three days and a seriously miracle win I won but feel angry because it felt just a bit unfair because I killed so many before and they get just more in return. After that the developers made what i wanted and that is the balance system where as much as you kill the enemy the less soldiers and equipment they have. Sadly that made the game actually easier since on Normal and Hard the enemy had half way through no soldiers since I killed them all and it got way easier to the point I actually still want the version it was before in early access. I then stopped playing being dissapointed but after like half a year decided to give it one final chance. I first played on normal and then on easy just for fun. But this made me just amazed. On EASY the enemy has 2 times more troops then i have even when i defeated the enemy basically every battle ._. This just made me dumbfounded since I played on easy and the enemy has more troops then me. Some of the bugs they removed thankfully like the Artillery being impossible to kill in melee or that cavallary us useless. But sadly stuff like enemy constantly charging or being stupid in open cover is still present as well as the enemy ALWAYS winning melee. The most dissapoint thing is that the dev´s stopped supporting it much which means these Bugs will not be removed in some time. You can get it for a couple of bucks when on sale but never for full prize. I had fun but way more annoyences then anything because of bugs. A last thing I want to say is the sometimes very stupid placement of Units that you cannot decide much at all, it´s all scripted which means units will be placed where the Computer things is right making advances to take ground for the next day useless.

Gameplay combines corps management and just a bit of rpg progression with real-time (with an option to pause at any time) army-level tactics. Simple, yet beautifully done 2D graphics, solid AI and overall a nice, polished feel. 

Army management and skill choices together with randomized battles lead to interesting replayability potential, since those do matter a lot here.

Campaigns feel great to play, as you proceed through them with the same army you have built and trained from scratch. The fact makes it also feel natural to try and avoid any unneccesary casualties on regiments you gradually start recognizing, remembering each one's strong and weak sides. 

There is a clear feeling that making a costly mistake will make your progress harder in the future. Some historical battles play out a lot differently with shifted balance of forces or a different strategy. Many times I was surprised to see the enemy dropping his (historical) goal very early on after realizing that he stands no chance of succeeding. Then he has tried to either flank / find an opening, or has fallen back on defensive altogether, standing to fight another day.

While it's 2D, and you won't get to zoom in too close, the distinctive, hand-drawn, art style, more than make up for it. It also causes the only real downside - in some cases it can be hard to tell a hill from a flat terrain and you can only guess how good or bad FOV you would get from a certain location before you get there.

Thought this was going to be like the Total War games but this game has something of its own going for it. If you like strategy games, this one is sure to challenge you.

 The campaign is linear, meaning you will have to play a set of battles with premade terrain and objectives. I initally thought i would dislike the linear campaign in my strategy game but io my suprise i actually like it. If you are a history freak like me, you will appreciate the backstory to every battle and how historically accurate it is. 

The objectives of battles usually consists of either defending or capturing objectives points. Sounds like it would get repetitive but every battle keeps you on your toes. The AI is actually some of the best i've played against. You can play 3 different difficulty levels. I've only played the medium and it is definitely challinging for me, and I'm definitely not a newbie in strategy war games.  There's 2 different factions you can play as. Confederate and Union. Each faction has it's own campaign, so there is plenty of play time in the game. As of wrintting this I've got 34 hours and I'm only halfway into the first campaign. 

One of the big pros of this game is army management. You can organize your own army, assign unit officers, recruit different units like infantry, cavalry, artillery and skirmishers. Every unit gains experience, that gains them passive perks. There is plenty of weapons to equip your various brigades, that each has their own strength and weaknesses. 

You will also get your own in game generel and gain career points, that gives you passive boosts. I bought this game on sale and i think it's one of the best buys this year. Would recommend this game even at full price. If you read this far then buy the game. You won't regret it

For one thing, command is limited to brigade sized units rather than regiments (and I always wanted a way to split regimental commands down further in Gettysburg so this is very much a move in the wrong direction for me). 

Similarly the brigades do take some smart formations, I guess, but nothing like ordering them into totally different formations as could be done in Gettysburg. Again, I felt the options in that game were too limited so this is a move in the wrong direction. 

It allows you to command an army throughout the entire war but not change anything of importance. As a Union commander I won every battle, but still had to fight all the same battles as the real war, many of which historically only followed directly from losing campaigns/battles. 

For example, the peninsula campaign is doomed no matter what you do. Despite winning the engagements I was offered to command the army retreats in defeat no matter what. 

And I captured the vast majority of the Army of Virginia at Antietam, totally destroyed them, but was only given a small bonus of “-5% enemy strength” for the next battle. Which I believe was the Fredericksburg campaign. 

After either of these me, the competent commander of the army of the Potomac, would have pushed forward, captured Richmond, and ended the war. 

Any Civil War game that doesn’t allow a competent union commander to annihilate the CSA by the fall of 1862 is a failure in my book.  

The core failure here is that the concept of Gettysburg doesn’t work on a longer timeline. If you take total command for three days with all forces starting in accurate July 1 1863 positions, then allow the battle to evolve based on what happens in several stages it makes for a really fun game. If you put me, the player into a few specific scenarios that have no bearing on what happens next then I lose interest. This game does the latter. Why win overwhelmingly at Antietam if I still have to wait around until December and then try to March up the hill at Fredericksburg? 

But the killer flaw of this game is that it is absurdly easy. The first mission or two can be tough but after that you build up an overwhelmingly powerful command and can annihilate your opponents by doing little more than dragging all your units towards the mission objective and letting the clock roll. Part of this Is just history, an aggressive and competent commander of the Army of the Potomac would have wiped the floor with the army of Virginia, but since this game is already an alternate history thing, could you at least make it challenging enough to be fun? (Or alt-history enough to be fun? I wouldn’t complain about how easy it is if I could win the war in 1862, but since that doesn’t seem to be possible then at least make it a challenge.) 

I still don’t understand how hard it is to duplicate what made Sid Meier’s Gettysburg so good. Let me control the battle as granularly as feasible. Give my actions weight both in the course of the battle and in changing history. And make it fun to do so. That’s it!!
By the end of a good play through of Gettysburg I feel like I changed the course of the war. By the time I quit this game after Antietam I felt like I was just watching a bad documentary about it. 

It actually takes special effort in Gettysburg to end up with the Pickett’s charge ending — you have to win and lose just the right missions — but this game would make it the default ending. If that’s the case, why play when I can read a 4th grade history textbook?",1545166271,1545166271,False,28,1,0.59930342435836792,0,True,False,False

0.1 for not being able to manage a proper frontline with the click-drag lines.  What I mean is that I don't want my infantry spread accross an entire map single file.  I want like a 7/3 or 6/4 ratio depending on the ground.  Right now I have to select my 6 brigades, make their line, then select the rest of the force and try and make their line behind the first.  That's how I roll, strength in the center to feed into tired/routed brigades, and to push forward when winning by leap frogging brigades, while my best troops hold the flanks.  Just let me build that into the line drag and I'm good.  I don't mind micromanaging the brigades during the fight, it's just the initial positioning that's annoying.

The game is ok at what it does. Which is  forcing you to replay historical civil war battles. Total war this is not.  You are given very little to no choice in where to fight or how to set up in battle. That being said you do have a choice how to ""build"" you army.  kinda 6 one way half dozen the other.

If you want a game of strategy and tactics where you are freely given control of the war akin to total war style. Stay far far away from this.

Its Not bad Its not good its meh. Know you are buying a MEH game and you will be happy with your purchase.

Whats good? 

You get to customize your army.  How many cannons, skimishers, infantry, sizes number even down to which guns they use, range vs power vs  melee vs reload. Real nifty stuff.

You get  to choose minor  battles to fight that provide bonuses once you fight the big major battle of the operations, reduced enemy size, lower enemy supply. Very neat

The bad

You dont get to choose where to fight, these are  preset battles-

Once you fight the battles are very scripted timed events. You dont get to setup which side of the field you fight from or how many units to deploy you just get your army dumped into positions A B or C at preset times. Then once the battle starts you have X amount of time  to destroy this enemy unit or that before you get swamped with more enemy troops leaving almost no time to manuevr and craft a custom strategy of your own.

The battles are pretty bland-

IT TAKES FOREVER to move a unit anywhere on the map. Realism? eh ok but the maps are literally just big enough to fit the armies. this isnt total war maps where you have space to move and flank the game all but shoves you  into the enemy. and because it takes so long to move a unit everywherre and because you are on a timer any custom placement of troops is all but out of the question, you just get dumped onto a barely big enough map and told to ""Fight""",1545000050,1545000050,False,1,1,0.464897632598876953,0,True,False,False

The best way I can describe this game is that what you'd get if cross Civilization's art style with XCom's gameplay.  The battle scenarios are all scripted, the enemy is going to have basically what history says they should have, and reinforcements will trickle in at the pace they did in the real battles. 

What throws people about Ultimate General is that generally speaking if you're moving, you're losing.  Units that are holding ground with good cover are not going to panic until they're badly encircled or melee'ed.  But units that are out in the open taking fire while moving, they may break and run before even firing a shot.  

What wins is XCom overwatch tactics... a strategically agressive campaign of tactically defensive battles.  You want the enemy to come to you, unless you absolutely have to take a position.  If you HAVE to take a position, you're better off flanking it if you have the time.  

Also, a word about difficulty.

A defeat in these battles will harm your reputation, which is used to gain extra supplies, and you lose if it drops too low. A victory will harm the enemy. These small battles build up to a huge, historical battle, such as Gettysburg.  A loss in a major battle would be disasterous to your reputation, and army. A victory will give a nice cash reward, and more reputation points. Your skills will determine the fate of America!",1544054996,1544054996,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was a hex/interface game that required a little mental visual imagination... This recreates that game on a format for the newer generation PC... It is entertaining as well as allowing the armchair General to select his/her look at how to win. Either side...

Saying that; Don't look for detailed zoom in or more than a closer look at the little ants... The battle maps are good enough but not overly detailed..

All in all I would say that my biggest problem is with the timer mechanics... IE: I move slow and sure, position my troops with care and minimize losses (just as I would if I cared about my soldiers)... A dead soldier may have taken a required position before his death but with a little more time he could have lived to fight another day for his ideals...

I give you the battle of Shiloh: After fighting the left and right flank actions I remove my weaker (gifted) army (out of ammo by then I must note) to the rear... Positioning my snipers forward to allow for the fallback... Move my personally created army (primary into position for a strong advance... Poof the timer runs out, it's the next day, the union army (destroyed or almost so) is re-enforced, back in a better position, my weaker (gifted army) is moved to the butcher shop... hindering my advance (timer) and leaving me no other choice but to charge for the flag in order to win...

This allows for a great loss of men as well as valuable officers... I win as a matter of need to but am damaged and left to struggle through rebuilding my primary only to have it happen again...

Answer: It is a game... the little people that have a name do not matter... The Win does...

It bothers me greatly since I spent over 20 years in the military (Special Ops, ASA, and the faceless heatless agencies protecting our country for another 20) and the loss of a man is not really an option if you have your shit together... Yet I do enjoy the game... 

Perhaps if the developer wants a following for future endeavors they may want to rethink a little...

I would pay full price or a higher price tag for a more realistic re-enactment... As it is... Buy it cheap... Remember it is just a game, and enjoy it... Doc",1544026688,1544026923,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The difficulty is insanely unblanced, and the game is just an exercise in frustration as a result. I just played the battle of Shiloh as the Confederates, and good lord... I was obliterating the Union forces and then they give me the final objective to take the landing. The AI magically teleports 10,000 fresh fully supplied troops in, counter attacks and obliterates my ragged, exhausted, out of supply men. I'm baffled on how it is even possible to win. Unfortunately, this happens far more commonly than it should. You will win and win, and yet the computer somehow has thousands more troops and better equipment than you all the time. It's absolutely absurd. There are other problems as well. For example, your men will sudenly charge or run in circles when you give them orders at random times, and this often times will cause you to lose a battle because instead of moving to that fortified forested hill, they will walk in a circle with their thumb up their butts and then get destroyed. Other issues as well are the fact tat despite having veteran troops with the best weapons and good commanders, I can sometimes catch enemies out in open field while my guys are in cover and my volley kills five of them, while there's kills 30 of mine. WTF? when you have two thousand, behind cover rifle vets shooting at open targets at close range in an open field, it should be killing more than five men. Skirmishers are overpowered. They will snipe and run and decimate your troops easily. Artillery are super difficult to kill, and cavalry get run over even when charging. A lot of really weird stuff going on here.

This needs a lot of patching, a lot of balance work. It's unfortunate it's this way because there are lot of good ideas here. I just wish the difficulty wasn't insanely hard on just normal, and the campaign would actually dynamically react to your wins and losses, instead of the computer becoming an unstoppable war machine as you progress despite losing every battle up until X point in the timeline. They give you message intercepts when you win or lose fights, and every time you crush your opponent's 30k men with a 5 to 1 kill ratio: Oh look! Lincoln just recruited 40k more men! and they're ALL verterans somehow! Now they outnumber you 3 to 1!

This is often frustrating as it makes no logical sense why the game would be programmed in this way. Additionally, at times your men simply don't fire, even if they have full ammo, condition, moral, and an open shot at the enemy.

Its campaign posesses all of the grognardy details associated with molding your army from an understrength brigade of a few hundred men to an army consisting of multiple corps of tens of thousands of infantry, cavalry, and cannon whom are all manually recruited, equipped, and trained. 

Which only sets the scene for the gameplay - which is nothing short of endlessly replayable. The first campaign mission is easily the hardest in the game and must be beaten in order to even start the campaign which, honestly, was a pretty awful design decision but is easily forgotten once you play your first grand battle. The way the game works is you rest and refit between every battle, be they the set number of optional skirmishes between what are essentially the main story missions, the historical grand battles of the American civil war. 

You have four basic types of units: infantry, skirmishers, cavalry, and artillery. However depending upon how you have trained, equipped, and fought with two different units of the same type their strengths and weaknesses may vary wildly. For instance you can equip a full strength infantry unit with outdated flintlocks and tell them to charge despite casualties every mission. Their melee attack, stamina, and morale will skyrocket while they will be useless in a firefight. But when your entire army's advance is halted by a single brigade of infantry hiding in the woodline equipped with springfield rifle muskets shooting twice as fast and twice as accurate as your infantry suddenly that brigade of sluggers is worth its weight in gold.

Niche units such as skirmishers and cavalry can be completely ignored in favor of the brute force of infantry or deployed in specialized formations performing niche battlefield roles. Skirmishers can be armed with anything from rifles with telescopic sites to henry repeating rifles with devastating and rapid short range firepower, just done let anything catch them in hand to hand combat. Cavalry can be equipped to skirmish with musketoons or carbines either from horseback or by dismounting before they engage to make them harder to hit, or armed with sabers and pistols to make their charges and melee attack devastating. I will say however, if you are looking for a total war like wargame where cavalry dominates infantry in melee you will be rudely surprised as cavalry formations realistically are comprised of small fewer numbers than infantry formations and the AI will always have mutual support amongst its own formations. Cannons can either be your counter battery snipe machines or giant metal shotguns killing thousands of men per battle, or any role in between. 

Perhaps my only gripe is the difficulty curve; you simply receive less money, recruits, and access to weapons while the enemy army scales to yours on a magnified slider as the difficulty is increased. However that is something that has only bothered me literally hundreds of hours into playing this game, as I have completed the campaign multiple times on every difficulty with both the union and confederate sides and I am sure I will complete them again utilizing what has become increasingly more bizarre strategies.

Overall this game is one of my top picks of all time. Flawless campaign design which does not bog you down with useless and unecessary details like many strategic war games and gives you total freedom over the composition and deployment of your forces into a beautifully balanced tactical layer against and AI that will surprise you over and over again with its subtle and cerebral play.",1543013960,1543013960,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only minor issue is some lingering bugs like units turning invisible in one mission when they enter a position.

EDIT: With the new patches the computer is now much more aware and tries much harder to hold objectives or seize yours rather than sit back and lose as it did sometimes in previous versions.

The game is in EA, and already the Dev's have torn it to pieces and lit it on fire, the same as its predecessor, Ultimate General : Gettysburg.

Never in my life have I seen such a counterintuitive, counterproductive, non-communicative early-access process in a video game. Darth and the other Dev's make absolutely 0 conscious effort to connect with the comminuty and see what needs to be done to improve the overall experience, or the broken mechanics (lots of em) in the game, and even seem to go above and beyond to deliberately ignore the communities input. The only (and i mean ONLY) input that Darth even remotely entertains is that of his beloved (and completely off-base) Beta Testers. Whom roam the forums policing thought and suggestive input thats deemed ""Useful"" for the game. It's a complete mockery of EA games.

I cannot reccomend this game in any way, shape or form. Merely the experience of the EA process of this game has me pulling my hair out, gritting my teeth, and looking for the nearset 3ft long segment of rope. This game is not fun in the slightest, it's simply an exercise in frustration. 

The game is in no way realistic, and does not attempt to re-create authentic Civil War era combat...at all. The AI Relies on Melee mechanics, and ""Blobbing"" as its main strategies, and the Campaign is not dynamic in any way. The Campaign in fact is a series of completely isolated and seperate scenarios that have no effect on eachother, and the main basis for difficulty is AI Army Size Scaling. 

There is no Multiplayer, and there will be no multiplayer. Yes, an RTS, on steam, in 2017... with no MP. 

Both the Forums, and the Reviews are heavily censored. If you do not share the established Beta-Tester's opinion on the games current state, or developmental progress, you are either berated and ostricized, or banned outright. This is by far the most corrupt, shady, and illogical EA process that i've ever been a part of. I can guarantee that i will never buy another Gamelabs product. 

I council you to not buy this game, no matter the intensity or longevity of your love for Civil War History and the events that transpired. Because you'll only be letdown. 

I can see this game being approachable for the extremely-casual, non-historically motivated, nonsensical players.

Edit: Full Release came- Nothing has changed. Every single game and AI bug and issue is just as persistent as the day the game entered Early Access. 

I will never buy another product from Darth. Most thoroughly disappointing gaming experience i've ever had.",1485025755,1542403660,False,2,1,0.473565667867660522,0,True,False,False

There are still some notes I'd like to give the developers.
-It's great that fortifications and entrenchments have been built into the map, but in an update or sequel I'd love to be given the ability to have your armies dig in with their own fortifications. 

-Unless you're intimately familiar with every battle and map, it's often difficult to tell where the strategic cover and high elevation points on the map. The ability to spin the map and view it from alternate perspectives would really help with this.

So hard to wait that long. 
Expectations were high.
Initial impressions were good. 
Lasting impressions not so much. 

Gameplay is excessively scripted and there is always a battle timer. The latter is annoying but can be forgiven, the former is annoying and not so easily forgiven. Even after initial victories as the Union, the enemy outnumbered me 2-1. This despite me spending as much of my winnings as possible. Unrealistic and cheap way to ramp up difficulty. The worst part is when a battle kicks off, scripted dialogue will tell you what to attack/defend. Reinforcements showing up in a scripted fashion is fine, but changing and multiplying objectives during a battle is not cool. For example, at the Battle of Shiloh, I held the right flank, a church versus over three times my number with minimal difficulty due to good use of skirmishers. Then the game said, congrats, but we're under attack in the center and right flank. Same battle, different units, adjacent map - this time against 5 times my number. Defeat was imminent, but I held on till the timer wore down. THEN the game says, ""great, but now you have to fall back to this position and THIS position before they overrun you (because it's scripted that way) AND remember that right flank on the adjacent map? Well, the map grew to include them and you have to bring them back as well..."" So I obliged, but before I could get any of my units back to the newly revealed objective, a confederate cavalry unit got on top of the objective. Despite the fact there was 3+ hours on the battle timer, the single confed cav unit just sits on the previously unknown objective for a few minutes and a nearly hopeless battle gets ended early. (Outnumbered at least 6-1 at this point)

I love the subject material. The controls and graphics are acceptable, but the battle design simply rubs me the wrong way. Incredibly arbitrary actions and odds really take the fun out of something that could EASILY be a blast to play.",1499279013,1538352213,False,4,0,0.486288607120513916,0,True,False,True

Not even on easy mode.  If you ask me, I would almost want to call this a ""TRTS"": Tactical Real Time Strategey (don't quote me on that one, I may have just invented that term).  If you're an RTS fan, I would bet you'll appreciate this, because it's not all about having the biggest army or the better weapons.  You have to actually think about plans in this one (you must learn how to flank, and guard your own flanks too).  

Another thing I like is the Campaign system.  Let me go ahead and tell you: unless you truly are a tactical genius, you most certainly will not win every single battle (not even on easy mode with North campaign).  You will have draws and you will have losses (I lost the battle of Shiloh on my Southern campaign), and that will impact the game.  For example, since I lost the battle of Shiloh, the North will have better weapons in the Battle of Gaine's Mill.  See what I mean?  It's similar to a real war: wins and losses impact the overall campaign, and also like a real war, you're not going to win every battle.  

If I were to give a tip to new players: save very frequently, because not only can you lose a battle, you can technically lose the war.  If you lose too many battles, you will basically be retired, so unless you want to play the entire campaign again, SAVE OFTEN.  Also, there's no shame in playing on easy mode.  Trust me, you need the experience before you need the challenge on this one.

The game eliminates the ability to do that by placing them where they should be based on history. An example would be the battle of Fredricksburg with the Confederates.

The learning curve when you first start playing in rather steep. I came to Civil War as a 130+ hours veteran of UG: Gettysburg and while this was a huge help in the tactical part of the game and I did well on the battlefield, managing my own army was something new to me and I lost my first campaign in 1865 only a few battles away from the final assault on the enemy capital.

In the tactical part where you lead your units on the battlefield there is a lot to keep an eye out for. You need to make use of terrain (elevation and cover), watch your brigades’ condition, morale and orientation and keep them supplied with ammunition. In other words, order your best brigade take cover in a tree line on the top of a hill and they will probably be able to hold it against overwhelming odds. Send the same brigade to cross a river and if an enemy opens fire on them from the flank while they’re waist deep in water they will retreat in panic.

There are three types of units in the game - infantry, cavalry and artillery.
Infantry makes up the bulk of your army. They are the most versatile units and under the right conditions the ones capable of taking and dispensing the most damage. 
Cavalry is mostly used for outmaneuvering the enemy and striking their flanks and rear, attacking vulnerable units or unprotected artillery and capturing supply wagons.
Artillery can soften up fortified positions, deal enormous amount of damage in certain situations and your long-range cannons can take out enemy artillery batteries from afar depending on the type of cannon you’re using.
Your generals are also present on the battlefield, raising your units’ morale and once reaching the higher ranks also providing small buffs to speed, cover or damage.

The AI is very capable and if you are making mistakes in positioning of your army it will find them and exploit them. Even now, after 300+ hours I occasionally find myself on the edge of my seat watching the enemy pressing my weakest point. I will never forget how during one of my campaign playthroughs I captured all four objective points in the Chickamauga wilderness. The enemy was pressing me hard in the middle of my line where two of the objectives were located and I gradually moved most of my brigades away from one of the objectives where the units were seeing no action whatsoever. I did manage to hold the line in the middle, but shortly afterwards the enemy repositioned their reserves to attack the weakened objective and I nearly lost the battle because of it. That being said, once you learn to evaluate the battlefield and only use the strongest positions the AI may struggle to penetrate your defenses - as it should considering the advantages such positions provided during the Civil War (Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, Cold Harbor) - and ends up fruitlessly assaulting your near impenetrable position and weakening their army to the point where any hope of their victory would be long gone.

Increasing the difficulty doesn’t make the AI smarter, but gives them more brigades with more men in each and a more experience on top of that. On some occasions while playing the campaign on the highest difficulty I found this to be detrimental to the tactical layer as in some battles there isn’t ‘enough terrain’ for you to position your units (such as Union Malvern Hill) and the enemy can just brute force their way through you without the need to make use of any advantageous positions or maneuvers. I don’t mind losing if the enemy played well and I was outsmarted, but watching your brigades getting obliterated in close combat by brigades twice their size and with double their stats is a bad way to lose a battle. Personally I think there is no need to play on the highest difficulty as even playing on Brigadier General (normal) difficulty provides quite a challenge and the better balance of forces makes the game more enjoyable. 

As I’ve hinted above there is a lot of progression in the campaign. Each brigade has several stats that increase as they fight battles (run around a lot and your stamina increases, shoot a lot and your handling of firearms improves, etc) and even commanding officers gain experience and get promoted when their units do well. Some stats could use a bit more clarification as what exactly it is they do. Years of battling will transform your rookies into tough veterans and as you equip them with the latest weapons they could deal enormous amount of damage. You will find that towards the end of the campaign - as both yours and the enemy units gain more experience and use better rifles and cannon - the days of charging an enemy fortified position by running through open terrain to fight up close will be all but over.

During the campaign you receive funding and recruits after each battle and also improve one of your own stats. You are the commanding general of your nation’s entire army. That doesn’t mean, however, that your position can’t change. Lose too many battles, or lose an important one at a bad time and you will be replaced, as it happened to many a Union general in the first few years of the war. In the game it means your career and most certainly your campaign, is over. If you do well on the battlefield, your government will like you more and apart from receiving more funding you will be able to ask favours to help you and your men fight the war, be it more money, recruits, a shipment of weapons or a transfer of a capable officer. Be careful how much you use this as your standing with the politicians in your capital drops each time you ask for something and if you lose a battle after asking too many favours you may be replaced.

The campaign follows the course of the Civil War battles, with all major ones taking place over historically accurate terrain. There is great variety in the terrain and usually plenty of opportunity to experiment with unit placement. Sometimes it’s even better to ignore some of the pre-built fortifications and place your units elsewhere. The game’s historical accuracy occasionally gets in its own way however. Historically some battles were fought over several days. In some cases that meant one side pushed forward and then retreated, before advancing again and so on. When these battles are recreated as they happened it means the player may lose progress on the battlefield. On several occasions I’ve captured most (but not all) objectives to a significant cost of my forces only to find myself back in my trenches the next day, because that was what happened back in the day when the battle was fought. It would be great to know in advance whether it even makes sense to assault the enemy position in any particular phase of the battle or whether anything short of driving the enemy from the field of battle will result in my forces retreating back to ‘their side’ of the battlefield. Anything less cheapens the effort the players put into capturing those objectives and makes capturing the same ones again the next day (often after the enemy has received reinforcements) a disheartening chore. That being said the whole thing becomes less of a problem once you learn the day-to-day progress of the battles and for me personally only ever became an issue in two of them (Chancellorsville and Cold Harbor).
I should also mention that the campaign can’t be won early no matter how well you do. Unlike what would have happened in history, even if you win every single battle, the war will still last 5 years and the first opportunity to win comes in 1865. While this removes a lot of player agency it is an understandable design decision as doing well should not result in a significantly shorter playthrough where the player never sees most of the content.

Obituary for Colonel Boyle ( Posthumously promoted to Major General):

In the beginning, Captain Boyle was a veteran of the Mexican American War and numerous other conflicts throughout North America. He was a proud and serving member of his state militia, a rank to retire upon and enjoy his twilight years in the southern sun.

The Civil War broke out and although near retirement he volunteered and was immediately assigned to the 5th Volunteer Georgia Infantry. Early on his regiment sustained heavy losses engaging the Federal Army at:

1st Bull Run
River Crossing
Crossroads
Shiloh
Secure River
Rendezvous
Seven Pines
Gaines' Mill
Malvern Hill
Kettle Run
Thoroughfare Gap
2nd Bull Run
Crampton's Gap 
South Mountain
Antietam
Iuka

Losing 20-60% casualties at nearly every engagement. Somehow, even early on in the war he outlasted and survived his fellow officers and quickly gained the rank of Major. At Shiloh, he was assigned to lead 250 Skirmishers which inflicted 3,500 Union casualties alone at a loss of 120 in his brigade. He was awarded and promoted to Lt. Colonel.

His brigade became the most elite in the entire CSA Arsenal inflicting a 10-20 kill ratio and capable of holding an entire flank independently. He was promoted to Colonel.

After our victory at Antietam, although victorious suffered over 50% casualties and an incredibly high rate of WIA and KIA for our famous CSA officers. 

Decimated and nearly leaderless, Colonel Boyle was reassigned to a newly created Brigade of Georgian Volunteers armed with 1842 rifles and in desperate need of leadership for a routine operation and inevitable fight with the enemy. 

His 1,000 Georgian riflemen held the extreme left flank behind a farmers wall. The Union army was routed except his flank, they were pinned and flanked momentarily. The Colonels brigade broke and ran, the hail of bullets hitting their backs running off the field,  Colonel Boyle was killed instantly trying to rally his newbs. 

Many years later Colonel Boyle was exhumed from a common grave not far from where he fell. He was buried with several dozen of his fellow Georgians soldiers and officers, stripped and looted of anything useful. Many of them mere boys.

This was his last fight before being promoted to Divisional Commander of the 1st Corps under General Lee. Cut down short due to some frosty and jumpy newbs. 

He would have been a famous commander, rivaling Lee himself! A man of no means, a common soldier, who rose through the ranks by his toil and unrelenting service to his nation. Now,  merely a footnote in history, left where he died that die.

RIP Colonel Boyle, you sent over 10,000 bluecoats straight to hell. 

You now take your leave in the Southern Sun.

After a hundred hours and three playthroughs, here are a few thoughts that would take the game to the next level: 
1. There is a large gap between the game's equivilent of normal and hard difficulty. Normal is easy and hard feels like there is no way to win. 
2. Victory is determined by holding ground, but at least on normal difficulty, the AI does not care very much about these key hold points. The enemy units  orient to where your units are. This becomes very problematic on some battles, like Gettysburg, where if the AI cannot see your units, it doesn't attack or do anything. 
3. The description of weapons in general needs to be clearer. The Parrott rifled gun should be better than the 10' ordinance, but the stats show the ordiance is much more powerful even though the Parrott is farther down in the list and I beleive costs more. Many of the other weapons and guns are in such short availability the entire game that you can only equip one small brigage the entire game. The result is you end up with a lof the same brigade. Yes, weapons like the Spencer Carbine were not plentiful at that time, but could bend a little to enhance the fun. Simply grouping the artillery by smoothbore, howitzer, rifled, and putting them in order of their stats, not cost, might also help. For example, a weapon may have high damage, but what exactly does that mean in a battle?  
4. Difference between captured and rescued goods after a battle is a little unclear. Also unclear is how you capture more goods. Does an enemy unit have to surrender? Is it about the percentage of ground taken? 
5. There seems to be a decreasing efficiency of units, even with high command, that are the maximum size. For example, the maximum efficiency for artillery seems to be 12 even though you can have 24 guns. Not sure why the game would penalize you if you have a commander able enough. This may be incorrect, but I just seemed to get better results with average sized units.

I am currenly playing as the rebels on the medium difficulty campaign.  The campaign is very frustrating for a few reasons.  The main ones being, the game does its very best to ensure you don't have the upper hand in any situation and lose a sizeable amount of troops so that your army doesn't become too experienced and large.  Certain units in the game are also mostly useless, such as cavalry and skirmishers.  Artillery is also not very effective unless it's right on top of the enemy firing grapeshot.  You need to win pretty much every battle or else you lose the campaign instantly.....REALLY DEVELOPERS?  What's ironic is before the start of each battle it shows you the income and prestige you receive for win, draw, and lose.  But you can't lose any battles ELSE THE CAMPAIGN IS OVER.  So stupid!  I got all the way to 1865 and and at that point every battle is a frontal attack against almost impenatrable Union defenses.  This is done to bleed your army so the final battle on Washington D.C. has no chance of victory.  Very disappointing and two thumbs down to the developers who completely ruined the campaign with bogus missions for 1865.

On the one hand it's a GREAT strategy game; the fact that you have to consider, ammo, fattigue and men forces you to make smart decisions in where to put your best troops, when to fire, and when not. - The simple graphics do the job well, and the fact that you can play this on a touch device is extremely satisfying (Played it on a my Surface). 

On the other hand, the biggest let down for me, is the ""timer"". It just ruins the experience for me. I find myself rushing objectives, rather than playing ""smart"". I've read around a lot when it comes to the timer, and I get why it's there. The immense ammount of irratonal arguments arguing ""But I do fine with the timer"", is just sad. It's not wether you are able to ""handle"" the timer or if you're a ""better player"". It's more about the difference in how you want to experience the game... I'm a supporter of the timer being ""optional"" (Like in Total War). It would give players the option of having a more relaxed playthrough. 

But then again there are battles where the timer makes sense, and it actually helps you win... So it's truly two sided, but in sum... it's done in a way that has led to more frustration than giving me the satisfaction of ""making it in time"". 

Even if I've put the game down now, due to the timer ruining it for me, I would still recommend this game. Because it's extremely well fleshed out! - But, if you're not the kind of person that likes to ""rush"" things, I would recommend you to think twice.

I for myself hope that, either, the devs make the timer optional, or, that someone in due time makes a mod that makes the timer optional.

At first glance this game has a lot to offer and despite the 2D graphics and easy control doesnt seem to do things much differently than other wargames but this first impression is misleading.
At its core the game is quite different to other wargames in its incentives and execution. The fun here lies solely in the battle system where large infantry armies win by outmaneuvering the enemy and clever micromanagement. This is where the game shines. And here it shines a lot. The AI is clever and you really feel the impact of your decisions and playing scenarios often feels rewarding.
Unit variety is of course very limited and the designers struggled to make cavalry and skirmishers(rather dettach skirmishers from your infantry battalions) really worthwhile but artilley and infantry gameply is really satisfying. 

However, this brings me to the two major flaws of the game: 
The campaign: The economic system, army management and campaign progression are all truly terrible (to my taste) and disregard the wargame genre standards. Economy  and army management are almost useless since the enemy will always scale so that it always outnumbers you. Here the game pretends to have depth that it doesnt.  And the campaign actually doesnt dynamically adjust to your exploits or defeats which means you have no incentive to defeat an enemy army completely and losing just one battle is often game over for your campaign. Panzer General in the early 1990s knew that a good campaign has forks and rewarding players for being good is a great incentive to continue to play the game.

The other flaw for me is ""realism"": I like wargames with a historic feeling and the more accurate it is the better. Here the game went with a more arcade feeling of all battles ending in a bloodbath with casualties even exceeding the bloodiest days of WW1. Furthermore, campaign progression also is a letdown in this regards since battles just get progressively more difficult so Gettysburg is actually way easier than Chickamauga for the CSA just as an example. Adding to this the fact that the AI always gets more troops than you have it (well there are rare exceptions) every battle is just more difficult for the side you are playing. I would have wished for a mix of easier and harder battles depending on the historical context.

I was destroying Confederate forces at Shiloh. I had no need to redeploy at Pittsburg Landing. I had out flanked the Confederate forces and established over 70% casualty on them. In short, I had taken gamble and changed battle history. However, the next day phase of the game kicks in and I am all of the sudden at Pittsburg Landing. I had completely surrounded and was destroying the Confederate Army, only for the game to then insist that I follow history. 
With that being said the game does take some time to master, and the AI will create some oppurtunites for you to take advantage of. I've played it for less than 5 hours and feel comfortable enough with it to take gambles in battle. At times the game is a little too easy and then it becomes very difficult, all in the same battle. I like that feeling of uncertainty, but you may not. With the exception of you not being able to re-write battle history the game is very solid. 
I would've like to have seen an alternative mode where you could be either Lincoln or Davis. Raising funds, keeping supply lines going, attempting to forge foreign alliances, and dictating where the armies will go. Hopefully that might be an option for  some future games in this genre.

Great game, just wished that there were ways to actually change the history of each key battles (i.e. Ultimate General: Gettysburg's style of your war council offering different troop deployment options).

Some tips for more difficult campaigns: Never fight on open ground (i.e. napoleonic style of infantry combat), occupy zones with more screening and projectile protections, more infantry brigades the better, use your influence points frequently, and max out politics + medicine (DO NOT MAX ARMY ORGANIZATION FIRST, 6 is sufficient until 1863 campaigns).

This game has many aspects of battle + managment carried over between battles that make the game quite replayable.

There are some balancing issues, and AI could be improved but it is still pretty good. I have noticed the AI does not have much of a chance in some battles but it still keeps coming. If they could retreat and keep their numbers it could make things really challenging.

It would be cool to have your commanders get awards in battle c: add some personality.

Also the XP system for the player really needs to be awarded even during losses. I have noticed after losing only 1 battle early the game can be very difficult unless you use prior knowledge or a pre-defined system how to allocate your xp.

Not bothered over the lack of tutorial as the game teaches you as you go , especially if you enable your advisor. Manuvering is crucial so far as several tens of soldiers drop with every volley , therefore you have to think about how you commit your brigades. tailoring my army is a really cool feature , as  im developing tactics around a predominately infantry and arty based army corp (block ,give fire ,advance , avoid enemy exploitation of my flanks !) The intelligence feature  adds great flavor and suspense to the game as well ! The engagements im winning , im finding i still have time on the clock . as well as the one that i lost so far, I pretty much forget about the timer as i get pulled into these battles anyways.

The game is really fun to play when everything goes well. Just LOVE having massive armies battling for inches.

Flaws. 
-The timer, your strategy turns into just a rush for a flag to beat the timer, kills a lot of the strategy.
-Generals. You kill the enemy general and there is no consequence at all.
-No topographical indicator makes you guessing on tatical heights, tough to do with a 2D game.
-Enemy AI charges when completely outnumbered.
-Your AI decides to move in its own, if units overlap, good luck holding a line.. You have to tell EVERY unit to hold ground.
-The UI is just bad. The indicator on showing your unit's range is green, the terrain is the same color, good luck with that.
- No indicator on unit's moral, cover, and stamina unless you click it, to get that info you have to click every unit.
-You can have two timers to fight, the master clock and objective clock. The master clock is counting down, but there is no time listed on how long you have ot hold the objective until you cap it, SURPRISE.


And there are soooo many more things that will bug you.

Also, if it had a tactical campain map the game would be much better. It's just select this or that battle.

Pros:
- Civil war history game with some fairly comlex and rewarding strategies
- Enemy AI is good in parts. Generally, quite clever with it's strategies
- Nice mix of troop types with some basic customisation
- Get to refight certain historical battles either in the campaign or custom mode
- Friendly fire doesn't exist as far as I can tell which is a positive when you consider the cons list

Cons:
- No tutorial. You're on your own bud

- Controls. There's no need to use the keyword beyond moving around. You can't zoom in or out that far. You can't rotate the cameria. You can re-bind keys but it's pointless when you only need a mouse

- The UI. Small, unclear, no hints or indicators. There's no Total War style spacebar button to show exactly where you've moved your troops to


-AI (too many points, see below)
- It's awful. The way your troops move is as if they're glued together. They all rotate first, then march in a straight line. They also do it at an excruciating pace which means you could end up losing a unit to this. I understand there is some historical reason for this but I'm fairly certain that in the thick of it, they didn't rotate their formation as much as this game
- Some units (especially infanty) will just wander off and move of their own accord. Rotating to meet an enemy, fine. But this isn't that. They will literally just start walking off
- Horses are slower than skirmishers (wtf). Supply wagons get sudden bursts of speed even though there is no run option. 
- Infanty run out of condition (basically stamina) stupidly quickly and with large battlefields it means you waste alot of time waiting for your troops to get into position.
- The run ability. It's broken. 
- Cavalry is generally useless. The combat capabilities are awful since after a couple of missions you'll end facing 1000+ infanty regiments. You mainly end up using it to try and sneak attack their cannon (the computer AI is clever enough to leave infanty near cannon anyway) or just holding points.
-Skrimishers always fallback when the enemy gets too close as does cavalry and there's nothing you can do about it. There's no ""stand your ground"" button to keep them in place
-Infanty will chase after routing melee units and, again, you can't stop them. This can be fatal if there other enemy units nearby since your infanty will be immediate hit with a ""rear penalty"" which could cause them to rout
- The penalties in general are awful. Skrimishers can cause thousands of men to retreat from a single volley if you're not careful. You get flanking penalties even if you haven't been flanked
- Some cover won't actually give you benefits it says it will. Due to the shape of some fortifications, your infanty will actually end up with flanking penalties even if they haven't been flanked. This results in constant retreat from some areas
- Infanty won't move if there's other enemy units nearby (this is hit and miss, sometimes they do, most of the time they refuse to move)
- There's a charge timer for some stupid reason which means you have position yourself perfectly if you want to charge because if you haven't reached the target by the timer has expired, you're dead (especially if it's cannon)
- Charging makes your troops move slower not faster
- Cannons are generally useless at killing at range but are OP at destroying morale
- The main thing combining the AI issues is that it's very hit and miss. You can have one game where everything goes to plan in terms of execution (aka your troops don't mess up) but there will be times when you'll need to restart the mission several times due to poor player AI
- Mass charges. The AI loves a good charge and will do it (as far as I can tell) as much as possible even if they have no hope of winning
- Troops can't fire over each other unless one is in a fortification. This forces you to spread out your entire army in one long line.
- Scaling. This was put in place to ensure that the AI can always give you a fight but the problem is that they put it on steroids. You can't destroy enemy units, ever. This means they all end up as veterans very quickly. This doesn't happen to you. Moreover, on multi-day battles it scales massive so you could end up fighting a force 100% bigger than yours by the second day. This takes away any sense of accomplishment

- Custom battles. Think Total War without the fun. You can't adjust the funds you get nor can you change the amount of men you can have. Moreover, everything still costs money, including generals, and the armoury is still there with limited quantities of weapons, which, once you've bought them all, you can't get anymore. This makes the mode boring and unenjoyable and forces you to play the game by it's rules. Poorly thought out game mode just added in

- The Campaign. Battle to battle. There's no ""what if"". The start and end is always the same regardless of how many battles you win. The developers missed a really good opportunity here to create an exciting campaign.

Though incomplete, I sincerely believe this game is going to be simply amazing when it is. For now, I can't stop playing it. I can forsee it having great replayability, as both the North and the South. 

Played all the battles up to Antietam, which is where the game currently runs out of road. My character went from Brigade commander to Corp commander. Besides the divisions (which I hope will change), you can personalize your units by naming your brigades and corps. You can use reputation from successes to get your hands on better weapons, to muster more troops, curry more money or even summon more prestigious commanders to your command. Outside that, the money and reinforcments you receive is predicated upon your perfomance, severity and importance of the particular battle you just engaged in.

Also, you can determine which troops to refill your ranks with- green backs or salty veterans. Less money for the former, but reduced experience and levels of skill as a conseqence; or, more money for the latter, but you maintain your experience and higher combat ratings. 

Personally, I really like the graphics and was impressed with performance. During antietam, I fielded around 85,000 men (infantry, calvary, artillery and skirmishers included), not sure about the Johnny Rebs, but I'd say around 60,000-70,000 men. The individual units started acting a little quirky at times, but it was rare and not a major ordeal. The battlefields are well crafted. 

Besides the rare quirky units in major battles, the only recommendation I have is for the camera to be free range. Right now, it is fixed at a angle- although you can zoom in and out to a degree. I'd like to be able to move the camera around and put it right behind units and watch as they charge into fight and scrap it out. 

Really, really a superb game!

You may notice I have only 76 minutes in the game.  That is because I don't need to know anything more after this one, game breaking, problem was experienced multiple times. (I have screenshots)

When the enemy routs (especially skirmishers), often they run THROUGH YOUR LINES, then run off behind you and eventually reform.  What.  The Fuck.  In SM:Gettysburg!, units NEVER routed into your lines, and if they did it was because of poor visibility in the woods and if they got close enough, THEY SURRENDERED, and marched off the field under a white flag.  THAT IS THE ANSWER, DUDE.  SERIOUSLY.  CODE.  THAT. IN.  

Or maybe you know that your AI would constantly be captured as they inexplicably rout into the enemy line.  

Darth, I am fucking ashamed for you.  This is a ridiculously broken game.  Fundamentally fucked.  How could such a smart AI coder like yourself fail to solve this one fucking problem?  And here I thought that the ""brigade of 1000 stalemates in melee fight versus gun-battery of 100 men"" problem of UG:Gettysburg was bad.  That was a drop in the bucket.

So almost every battle is very similar. If you try and be defensive which you need in this kind of warfare to get a better bodycount, it involves just waiting for the AI to attack you which can be long and tedious even on fast forward mode. 
You can influence the battles a bit by buying different types of troops, arty and rifles. But ultimately its a numbers game.
The campaign is not map based but really scenerio based which means you can choose maybe 2 or 3 battles but that always lead to a big one which is a historical battle. Because your battles have no strategic influence other than fighting them to move to the next scenerio, theres no grand scale in a war fought over massive land mass, a war that used trains for the first time. 
So much more could be made of this game with say TW type campaign map and game play but improved with better innovation in management. But instead its battle sim where units come into the battle at predetermined times and most of your time is spent just pushing units around a battle. If you like that thats cool. But i played through most of one campaign and was bored senseless by the end of it as it was repetiitive and there was no real grand strategy to it other than limited battle management.

+It's a decent dicking around game if you can overlook/tolerate the flaws, and it's better than it's predecessor so hopefully the successor to this one will be worth buying
+Can /slightly/ customize units and modify your army (for the most part, purely useless shit like swapping out commanders who all give the same perks, and renaming brigades, but not your divisions or corps because reasons)
+Has a lot of maps that let you refight many civil war battles
+doesn't crash a lot (the fact I have to put this as a positive to balance the negatives should be telling)
+Unit control is obviously inspired by the Total War franchise, and is less clunky most of the time
+Enemy AI in battle is surprisingly competent at controlling his units (which he will almost always have far more than the player)

-UI, sucks, or is nonexistant for almost everything you actually need to see, and is the single biggest handicapping feature that roadblocks most of the things this series introduces to the genre. In a military firearms-era game the fact you can't have range number for your artillery (crucial because canister, shell, and shot does vastly different damages at different ranges) is a stupid thing to make the player guess at. You'll have dozens of battles you'll have to restart because your units panicked and broke because of the bad AI interacting with the morale system and artillery, and you have no way of knowing they're about to shatter unless you click through every single unit in a battle that can have over 50.  
-The AI gets skirmishers. Now you'd think this wouldn't be a problem, until you realize what this means in most battles there's ten units that run faster than anything you have (including cavalry), are invisible when firing (despite this being the age of black powder), and outperform your own because the AI can micro them faster than you can because A. it's a computer and B. it's a computer. Not that it should matter, because thanks to scaling if you use them the AI will get even more, and better ones. 
-The maps are obviously pretty, however you can't do things that have been in this genre for decades because of it. Want to rotate the map to help you control/see units? Or orient the map in a sensible/reasonable direction like north or towards what you're attacking? Too bad. At least they kept the WSAD navigation but that's the only thing they didn't shortchange, also during the prebattle briefings you're told how the historical battle went, then placed on a cartoony map which makes it hard to recognize those features, labels (like every other game in the genre) would have been nice.
-Unit customization. Or lack thereof. You can swap weapons, you can change names of individual brigades/batteries, and that's it. Of the weapons, there are a half dozen that are mandatory equipment (springfield 1842, enfield, harpers 1855, springfield 1861 for infantry, 10lb ordinance, 24lb howitzer and 24lb parrot for artillery, and the cheapest melee weapons for cavalry), the rest only gets used to sell when you capture it from the AI. 
-Inclusion of almost all of the better weapons (except 24lb artillery which is mandatory) is worse than useless. Repeating rifles rightly cost 10 times more than the cheapest weapons, but the forced volley fire means the higher ROF they had doesn't matter and with the much shorter range and accuracy (as much as half) the elite units will get slaughtered/stunned/routed trying to get close enough to use them. Ditto with specalized weapons like the skirmisher rifles and the counterbattery artillery. AI gets 600 men artillery brigades by the dozen, and the timer will run out before you can kill them, all you can do is ignore them or suicide charge them. 
-A timer. For every single battle. And because of the way the game is designed, almost all the battles revolve around you rushing to beat the clock which forces you to make stupid/suicidal moves and lose men, my favorite being the only way to deal with them is to charge them with infantry or cavalry taking hundreds of losses to canister because you don't have time to kill them with skirmishers or heavy artillery, no matter how many you brought. 
-The reason it looks smoother than the Total War series is because the only orders you can give your units are via mouse buttons. Obviously that's a limiting factor, and combined with the awful AI/UI you'll frequently have to restart battles (I've played some two dozen times before getting them to do as told) to prevent the suicide of your army.
-Unkillable units. The AI levels up units faster than yours, which is fine, it's an AI it needs help. But if you surround a 3 star infantry unit that's been reduced to 300 men with 10k men and 60 guns you'll kill off a few of his men then he'll ""shatter"" and disappear, and you'll have to fight him again, rearmed and reinforced, the next battle. 
-The campaign game design had no thought given to what it's like to experience. It's supposed to have you refight the Civil War, but we already know how that went. So what happens, is you kill all the bad guys on battle 1. You have to replenish your losses, his army on battle 2 is directly proportional to the size/composition of yours. And AI units are unkillable, no matter how many losses you inflict they'll come back with higher veterancy next time (neat trick, I kill 1800 men of a 2k brigade, those 200 survivors magically transfer all their knowledge to 1800 replacements in a week). What this means is AI losses don't matter, and on harder difficulties or later battles you'll spend two dozen straight battles taking less than 10% losses and inflicting over 70%, and find yourself outnumbered 4:1 and facing human waves of infantry and hundreds of artillery pieces. It's incredibly frustrating because every time you see the numbers it's just reminding you that nothing you do actually matters to the outcome.",1528543964,1528544499,False,110,3,0.750388026237487793,5,True,False,False

Ultimate General: Civil War is a fun game when you first play it. I've even written a few guides for the game.

It bills itself as an authentic historical game with good AI. At first glance, the game does all of this wonderfully.
Deeper analysis of the game reveals fundamental design problems that only become visible with time.

Many of these problems are known to the developers. However due to the mechanism the devs use to solicit feedback these issues remain unaddressed since early access. Other problems are more fundamental, such as a lack of true player agency (a la Mass Effect 3)

[b]Problems with the AI[/b]
Once you get past being beaten by the AI in the beginning and get used to the quirks of the game then the advertised 'strong' AI vanishes. Each map basically devolves into one of two strategies depending on if you are on offense or defense.

The challenge the AI provides against you is not in the AI being smart. Rather the challenge is in the sheer numbers the AI has versus you.

The problem gets worse if you play on half speed. With careful micromanagement, it's possible to defeat armies with 5x the number of men you have as well as drive back the relentless AI charges (if you aren't playing offensively that is). You can even cancel AI charges if you do things right. The AI pretty much always reacts the same way to you and it is easy to learn how the AI reacts and do the same thing every game. This is a regression from UG:GB where the AI had different personalities and acted differently.

[b]Problems with Game Mechanics[/b]
Some of these problems with AI involve various bugs. These include AI breaking charges if you reposition units, AI favoring charges even if the unit is exhausted (which you can halt the advance by micromanaging artillery). Others are more fundamental. For example, early on in early access the AI had problems defending their artillery. So the game devs, instead of making the AI better at defending their artillery, made artillery invincible to melee.

Similar examples of game mechanic problems exist elsewhere. Melee mechanics were broken since early access. 2 brigades of 200 men in melee will perform 4x casualties as 1 brigade with 400 men in melee. Thus, some players (in a single player game mind you) liked to stack lots of tiny cavalry brigades and abuse the melee mechanic bug to beat battles. This bug was reported and these players complained the game was 'too easy'. Instead of fixing the broken melee system (or *gasp* asking the players to not use such strategies in a single player game), it was decided that 'cavalry was too powerful' (since this was the most commonly abused unit). Thus, cavalry got nerfed to the ground so much that the only way to use them is to abuse the melee bug. A 400 men cavalry brigade can't even chase down 90 skirmishers without getting routed.

[b]Problems with Realism[/b]
These issues of game design, where bugs are not fixed but instead hidden, permeates to the entire game. It results in unrealistic situations that hurts realism of the game. Such as 750 cavalrymen who manage to surprise 200 artillerymen from the rear failing to beat the 200 artilleryman and instead being routed and losing half your men. BUT if those very same 750 cavalrymen were dismounted before engaging the artillery, then the results won't be as disastrous (AI will still not lose men though thanks to invincible AI artillery). It results in the best way of dealing with artillery being shooting them (and eating canisters to the face) rather than charging the cannons. It results in on harder difficulties having to play the game a certain way rather than having true agency.

[b]Problems with Player Agency[/b]
On the topic of player agency, UG:Civil War does a poor job of this. On easier difficulties player agency is somewhat there as the AI is not gifted tons of men to produce artificial difficulty. Thus as the game goes on if you manage to defeat the AI (where the AI loses 3-5x your men) the AI won't be able to reinforce. This creates other problems such as the 2nd half of the campaign being too easy.

Due to this complaint (and also due to complaints from players exploiting game bugs and AI weakness on higher difficulties) combined with the lack of difficulty levels, hard and legendary difficulties are not only incredibly broken but also unfun, a tedious chore, and lack player agency. The AI patently ignores the 'army intelligence' screen where you see how many men it should have and deploys much more men than the number shown. This means you can't play with a small, elite army that's lowered the AI army strength, no, you have to bring as much men as possible.

Since the game ignores the army strength on higher difficulties there's no point to capturing or killing AI at all. Instead it's a matter of force preservation (since you only get limited recruits). As the AI is gifted a new army each time you destroy an army, the facade of player agency collapses completely. It simply does not matter what you do or how many men the AI loses.

Fundamentally these problems are a result of a lack of dynamic campaign. This is compounded by game bugs exploited by players on hard/legendary that were never fixed which makes the game 'too easy' for them. Or the lack of a true dynamic campaign where you can choose to end the war early if you manage to defeat the enemy army.

No, the solution chosen by the devs was to brush the bugs under the rug and just give the AI more men (or men invulnerable to their weakness such as invincible artillery). This doesn't result in a fun game. Rather it results in a game where battles become a CHORE to micromanage and abuse AI weaknesses (not to mention all the small bugs which still have not been fixed). It's not any more challenging or hard in a tactical level.

[b]Problems with Feedback[/b]
One aggravating factor which lead to these decisions has to do with feedback. Due to the many different ways one can play a game, issues which may crop up for some players may not crop up for other players. Similarly, due to the vast difference between normal and hard in difficulty (different AI bouses), playstyles/bugs which may work on normal may not work on hard.

Instead of soliciting feedback from the playerbase as a whole, the general impression I have from watching the game progress since early access is that a small privileged group of testers (who tend to be experts and or play using certain strategies) have their suggestions favored more by the devs. This isn't necessarily the fault of the devs, as these players are simply more active in providing feedback. 

This generally wouldn't be a matter if it wasn't for the fact that some of these more active players have a habit of discounting other player's problems (since it doesn't occur for them with how they play). This leads to issues where unless a problem is faced by a majority of players, problems which only affect some players are routinely ignored or outright dismissed. It also leads to poor balance changes and honestly a terrible experience for new players who are thrown into the game (eg the patches making the first intro/tutorial level harder and harder and harder to the point where new players have to go on the forum and ask for how to beat the FIRST LEVEL).

[b]Hostility to Modding[/b]
Many of these fundamental issues would be solvable if there were modding support by the devs. One would think the modder DarthMod would have supported modding in his/her commercial games, having come from the modding community.

Instead, impediments to modding were added on purpose to reduce the basic modding possible in UG:CW.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
I would honestly prefer to play the first early game access version of the game rather than the current version of the game as it is now. I lack faith the devs will be able to fix fundamental problems based on experiences since early access.",1509154212,1527581994,False,288,4,0.867243766784667969,25,True,False,False

TL;DR: t's a good game, especially for it's niche audience.  The issues that plagued it's early development have mostly been fixed, but there are still minor issues that will frustrate you on occasion.  The latter years of the war feel rushed, but there's a well balanced campaign that offers plenty of chances to learn.  A fun nostalgia trip if you grew up playing Civil War strategy games.



Perhaps the best thing I can say of this game is that it is what you'd get if you put two classic American Civil War strategy games into a blender and mixed; a wonderful mishmash of elements from Robert E. Lee: Civil War General and Sid Meier's Gettysburg/Antietam.  It's got relatively intuitive controls, incredible artwork and landscapes you fight across, an engrossing army management system in the campaign that's slightly reminiscent of  XCOM's base management, requires you to both manage strategy and logistics to succeed, but does so simply enough that you won't be overwhelmed and lost during your first playthrough-la Hearts of Iron, and, well, it's just a dope Civil War strategy game (this last point only will matter if you are of the opinion that dope Civil War strategy games are underappreciated in today's market).  If you've got some serious nostalgia for Sid Meier's Civil War games, this game might just fill that void.


And now, to the list of grievances:
Firstly, if you are expecting the amount of customization of strategy and potential historical revisionism with strategy offered by the preceding Ultimate General: Gettysburg, you will be profoundly disappointed.  With some few exceptions, the player is always stuck fighting historical battles with the same goals set by the historical commanders (Fredericksburg as the Union is a real treat, especially if you've won every battle up to that point.  Nothing better than being forced into an unnecessary head on assault that will annihilate the cream of your army! On the plus side, you get to experience firsthand all of the frustrations of competent officers of the time serving under incompetent politician-generals).  At times, securing the historical objectives ahead of schedule will win you the battle, without regard to subsequent events (most noticeable at Second Bull Run and Chancellorsville).  Other battles (Shiloh, Stones River, Gettysburg) force the defender to retreat to historical lines, regardless of how effective the defense was (i.e., falling back to Cemetery Hill, regardless of whether or not the Confederates actually captured Seminary Ridge).  Thus, if you're looking for that ""What if"" scenarios that UG: Gettysburg offered, you'll walk away disappointed.


Furthermore, the AI could use some improvements.  The issues are no longer as pronounced and game breaking, but there will still be a few instances of a brigade deciding that the best path of retreat is straight through the enemy lines. This can be frustrating.  The AI is heavily weighted towards victory points, so you'll need to use caution when deviating from the historical lines of battle that the game seems so hellbent on forcing you to follow (and trust me, you'll usually want to deviate from following the path of history).  This can lead to players losing a battle they were handily winning, because the enemy managed to sneak a few hundred cavalrymen around your lines and capture the strategic location; a location you long since abandoned to pursue and destroy the enemy, thus costing you the battle.  It can be frustrating.

Relating to the touted ""AI management"" that's supposed to help new players learn the game without being overwhelmed in pitched historical battles, all I can say is don't use it.  It's OK defensively, but abysmal on the offense.  AI in general is quite poor at tactics in this game, including the opposing AI.  Gone is the dynamic difficulty system from Ultimate General Gettysburg, where you could choose the tactical ability and aggressiveness of the enemy; difficulty is instead determined by the size of the enemy army and the resources you receive to build up your own.  As a result, once you've learned the tactics of the game, the difficulty instead comes from strategic elements, like deciding on the best composition for your army.  I found this disappointing.

You'll still need to heavily rely on the ""hold"" order to keep your brigades from doing stupid things, like wheeling about in their heavy cover and instead exposing their flank to the enemy assault, simply because they were targeting an enemy unit that charged a nearby friendly unit.  Happily, however, the hold order seems much improved; units still occasionally will not engage an enemy unit that's within range and firing on them unless you directly order them to, but these instances are now few and far between.

On an incredibly minor and nitpicky note, the developer has chosen to continue the specific insanity of portraying a unit's effective range via a light brown/green conical outline.  This outline remains impossible to see in many, many battles.

More extreme nitpicking that should generally be disregarded: the game doesn't have multiplayer.  It wasn't advertised as having multiplayer, so don't hold it against them.  But this game will probably make you wish it had multiplayer.

The early issues of army scaling have been fixed, however, and players will no longer find themselves going against overwhelming odds in battle after battle.  The enemy army still scales in size based on the size of the player's army (the difficulty settings effect this scaling), but the enemy is now penalized based on the player's performance in prior battles and the minor engagements of the campaign.  Furthermore, minor engagements have been improved; in addition to providing money and recruits, victories in these engagements usually provide a debuff to the enemy army for the large scale historical battle, usually taking the form of a reduced enemy army size (and occasionally penalizing their morale or weapon quality).  This furthers the cost basis analysis the player must perform when deciding whether or not to fight the optional side battles.

The latter stages of the campaign do feel a bit rushed. After Gettysburg, only three historical battles (Chickamauga, Cold Harbor, and Richmond/Washington) remain, with a scattering of side battles representing the major engagements at Atlanta, The Wilderness, Spotsylvania Courthouse, Petersburg, and Nashville.  It may disappoint those particularly well versed in the history of the American Civil War who were looking forward to waging a campaign of tactical finesse during the brutal fighting that characterized the war from 1863-5.
But to end things on a very positive note, in spite of this, the campaign is actually very well balanced in terms of a learning curve; players will spend the early game learning to fight offensively and defensively and utilize the terrain to their advantage with a small, easily manageable army and many ""non-player-army"" units joining them in the early historical battles (providing a more disposable force that you don't have to worry about reinforcing in the event of massive casualties).  By the late game, players are given the opportunity to demonstrate a mastery of the tactics they've learned, commanding massive armies of their own design at battles like Chickamauga and Cold Harbor, with both Union and Confederate campaigns concluding with an all out assault on the well fortified enemy capital that is ahistorical, but nonetheless incredibly gratifying.",1491003135,1527495253,True,21,0,0.630676686763763428,0,True,True,True

Problems I have with it include:
1. Cavalry is a useless unit that ought not even be there. I have yet to see a game session where the cav was not overtaken from behind and annihilated by guys running on foot. Enemy cav is significantly different in almost every way than yours. Enemy cav at least twice as fast as yours, maybe as much as 4 times faster. Enemy cav can run up to an infantry line, fire then run away with minimal losses evan against your largest unit. They can repeat this dozens of times. If you try that you lose your unit on the first approach. When they run away and you shoot them, you get no rear flank bonus for the shot. When you run away and get shot you get smoked from the rear.

The damage done by cav I deem appropriately balanced. I just wish I had the same capabilities on a fundamental level as the enemy has. Then it iwould be great. Enemy cav devastates your cav irrespective of force siae. I had an enemy force of 50 cav beat up from battle completely wipe out my fresh untouched cav force of 750 in about 20 seconds. I had better guns and charged them from behind while they were fleeing an attack against my infantry unit. It walked away with 42 like it was no big deal. My 750 routed and ran off the map. It happens every time you use them. They don't do what you tell them to do. 90% of the time the game will not even let you select them to assign different orders to them. And they never ever survive a battle ever. Not even in a dream. Unless you leave them somewhere and never use them. Which is arguably the best way to employ them in the end. Cav is absolutely useless.

2. Janky interface. Assign an order to one unit, some other unit on the other side of the map decides to carry out the order instead. Every time you want to change a unit's order, you have to pause the game...then give the order...then make sure the guy you told to do it is the acutal one who has decided to carry it out... and all your other orders for every other unit on the map are all still in place...then you can safely unpause. Makes every game take about 6 time longer than it ought to. It would be better to simply make it a turn based game instead.

3. Units don't move when you tell them to. Imagine that you actually are able to give an order to an unit, and then that unit you told actually decides to be the one who executes the order. Whew what an accomplishment. But then you find he does his own thing. Doesn't do what you told him to do. Go here...he goes there. Stop and shoot....he turns his back on the enemy at point blank range. Charge....won't charge. Stand in this line and don't move and fight....he goes wandering off one minute later. Constant refusal to carry out what you tell them to do like 40%+ of the time. It is awfully difficult to play, let alone win, when your troops disobey your commands 40% of the time and decide to go wandering off somewhere or turn circles so every enemy who wants to gets a great shot from behind or just won't shoot at all.

4. Interface won't let you seelct your units. Often during battle you see a unit disobeying your commands and you are not permitted to select him to tell him to stop that and do something else. They go off on their own for anwhere from about 10 seconds up to as long as several minutes of game play. Rogue units off on their own that you cannot command in any way for half the duration of the battle. Happens all the time. Had one run all the way across the map iuntil it got stuck in the corner. It stayed there unselectable until about halfway through the battle. Came staggering in at the very end, full force strength, never fired a shot, exhaused from all the travelling, and arriving after the action was over. Its commander got promoted after the battle...

5. Battles have no middle ground. Either you annihilate the enemy, or he annihilates you. There is a Win/Lose/Draw mechanic, but I've never seen any draws occur. Not even close.

6. Spent one battle where I set up my defensive line, started the battle, and when the enemy showed up he set up his line way out of range. Never attacked. Hour long battle and the only units who ever fired were the cannons which were ineffective at such long ranges. No unit on either side ever moved an inch from its original position. And I won a victory because the objective was to hold my poisition. Spent the battle watching TV then all of a sudden I just won. So boring I wasn't even paying attention. It was pretty damn silly IMO.

7. Formations are a huge factor during battles. The game's combat code implements this fact very nicely. Yet the game interface provides no means whatsoever to control a unit's formation. Sometimes they choose to column up, sometimes they choose to form a line, and there is no way to know or predict when it will happen, Units in a line with great cover will happily wheel around and expose their flanks and rear to an enemy 30 feet in front of them with annoying regularity. You cannot stop it. Well you can, but you have to micro manage on such a millisecond by millisecond scale that you will spend 99% of your game play experience in pause mode if you expect to succeed with every unit in your army at every given moment of the battle. Eventually you just get sick of it and let the enemy shoot your guys in the back from time to time. It is something you come to expect. Also, only the enemy gets any bonuses for formation type advantage. If they attack you from the side, you get the Flanked penalty. From behind you get Rear Flanked. Never do your forces get these. Enemy infantry 500 strong runs up to your 2000, attacks for awhile, gets whittled down until it breaks, turns and runs away, you get nothing special for 2000 shots up his ass.

On the plus side, the enemy AI is fairly descent most of the time (the example I gave in 6 above is admittedly not normally what you get). If only I was able to tell my units what to do, and then they would do what I tell them, the game seems like it could be challenging. The in-battle interface needs a ton and a half of work. It is extraordinarily janky. Trying to select a unit and give them an order it a tough proposition nearly every time you attempt it.

Overall I give it about a 3/10 for playability. I don't think it comes anywhere near the $30 price tag in value. If you could get it for less than $10 then maybe you'll feel you got your money's worth...depending on how patient a person you happen to be. If you are easily annoyed, this game could be hazardous to your life.
Graphics are acceptable 7/10 for that. It is a top down strategy game after all, so that isn't entirely critical. I wish they had included elevation lines though. It is pretty hard to determine where the high and low ground is, and how steep hillsides are etc. Contour lines would have helped.
Bug free engine operation. 10/10 on that. I never had a crash or graphic glitch or freeze or lag spikes or any of that. All the bugs are in the game play code and particularly the in-battle inteface code.... The menu system interface for when you are not in battle is workable, but a little convoluted and confusing in its organization and functionality. It takes effort and curiosity to learn how to use it. I found it to be vague. So you gotta figure it out by trial and error. One of the main issues is that highlights are sometimes not strong enough to notice. This is true during battles too. For example, there is a button you can press to make a unit run when it moves. Clicking it toggles a ""running"" state for the unit. It runs until you toggle it off again. But the highlight that lets you know if a unit is running is so similar to is non-running state that you cannot simply look at it and tell if the unit is in running state. There is no color shift in the hightlight, it is simply a very marginally brighter tone....and therefore useless.

17 September 1862; Union foces have amassed and prepare an attack on the creek at which my 10,000 soldiers and 60 guns stand, more reinforcements are expected and by mid-day I shall have an army of around 35,000 excluding my 140 guns fully manned and around 2,000 cavalry (these played a key role for me in the battle) however I am still horrified at the odds I face, around 70,000 Union infantry a similar amount of cavalry to me and of course a significant artillery advantage estimated at about 200 guns. My only advantage lies in the creek I have chosen to defend; my men are well covered by the trees and we are prepared to mow down the Unions first wave, my cavalry head north to harass the unions northern flank, little did I know the skill of confederate cavalry (with my awesome leadership).
The first wave is upon me, thousands upon thousands of Union men enter my line of fire, perhaps a little to complacent as some even attempted a bayonet charge as blue bodies began to litter the battlefield, as morning came to an end another Union attack wave reached me as my casualties began to mount, I have no definative number but the casualties are around 2:1 in our favour at this point at the least, my cavalry who up until now have been desperately evading Yankee troops up in the north have been freed by Early and his 900 men sent to deal with the Bluecoats, my cavalry are free and I can unleash my masterplan.
The Union launches a small attack on Sunken (I think thats what it was called, civil war buffs may correct me on that) road and my small but sturdy garrison of a few thousand and a small artillery detachment held for now. By now the battlefield is littered with bodies mainly blue and is disfigured by the unfathomable amount of shells fired. My cavalry have been harassing the Unions right for a while now but I realise that I must tale direct control, I send both cavalry brigades I have in a enveloping movement to behind the main Union lines, meanwhile the Union amasses a massive army in secret to attack my garrison on sunken road, their attack commenses and my garrison can barely hold, thousands of men arrive from the south to reinforce my army and 40 artillery guns, I send them to defend the road and and replenish my thinning lines in the forest to the northwest, things are looking good and the union attacks are failing, though their southern attack on the road is becoming a threat. So I unleashed my masterstroke, my cavalry still supported by Early's brigade were now behind the Unions lines so I ordered them to strike west, simultaneously I bombarded the Unions right flank (north) with artillery and volleys of gunfire. As their line retreating they were mowed down by cavalry gunfire and another bombardment from my artillery the Yankees were reeling, so I put them out of their misery with acavalry charge from the right and a bayonet charge from the left, needless to say it was a massacre!
With the Union right flank completely shattered I turned my entire northern army round and along with an overwhelming artillery bombardment I hammered their line and routed the entire Union army, oh the glory, a blob of confused and disorganised Yanks routing from the battlefield, I turned on steamroll mode and pushed them back around 2 kilometres in a few minutes. I pushed them back into a small wooded area, this is where I decided to stop as I surrounded the woodland on 3 sides, and the troops that would have guarded the 4th side were sent back south to protect against a Union attack at two bridges further south, stony bridge and... Other bridge along... A river. The fighting for these bridges was desperate, truly the definition of a bloodbath, at one point I even lost Stony bridge before some more reinforments from the northern encirclement, not realising what was too come. At this point my casualties are about 10,000 infantry and a few hundred cavalry and a few artillery guns. Union losses are unknown but based on what happened next and what their end of the battle losses were I would say around 40,000. It was a decisive victory, until the final phase. 2 hours of the battle left, I was certain of victory. then I noticed that the battles for the bridges was drying up, since the battle was nigh on a victory I assumed the Union were fleeing or that they had simply been killed. I was wrong...
In the north a collosal Union attack was commenced with 90 minutes (game time) There were 4 strategic points I needed to hold in order to have victory on the day and this huge build up of over 20,000 Union troops completely overwhelmed my dwindling forces at the woodland, I sent thousands of troops and as many guns as I could muster north to fight off this 'Blue Death' but to no avail, almost the entiriety of my northern army was killed, thats around 9,000 men killed in a matter of minutes. I was in shock, but being a professional general I needed to fight on all available troops guns and horses were sent north to fight them off, I formed a defensive line and tried to stand my ground.
Without going into specifics I somehow managed to hold them off.
Total casualties for me in that phase of the battle were over 10,000 infantry 20 guns and around a 1,000 cavalry while the Union maybe lost 5,000. All that in an hour game time. However, I managed to hold onto all strategic locations and the battle was a victory. Over 20,000 Confederate losses were recorded, almost 2/3 men died. Union losses were even more disastrous, a little over 40,000 men out of around 70,000.

UG:CW is not a strategy game, it's a logistics and tactics game. 

Most of the gameplay is focused around leading troops on the battlefield in pre-determined battles and then using rewards from battles to develop your army for the next pre-determined battle. In the battles themselves, the player also has only minimal control of when and where units are deployed. The most strategy that the game implements is having some optional battles in the campaign and choosing which corps will be used in the battle.

The tactical simulation is generally great, though its few flaws do warrant some criticism. The control you have over your units feels both effective and realistic for the time. The Enemy AI is well constructed to make battles feel difficult and to make victory feel earned. The difficulty scaling is also great as the increasing difficulty of battles keeps the player engaged, even at the expense of realism. It is not coincidental that optional battles towards the end of the game are frequently harder than earlier major battles. That said, a lot of the disconnect that is felt comes from this scaling. To make battles at the end of the campaign difficult, the enemy armies generally need to be large and well trained regardless of the realistic capabilities of the Union and Confederacy. The reason enemy casualties seem inconsequential to the overall campaign is that, to keep the whole campaign interesting, the enemy army must always maintain its strength.

If this game was a strategy game focused on winning the Civil War, the criticism of its lack of realism would be very strong. Instead, this game is a tactics and logistics game that uses the Civil War as a skin. The tactics and logistics are generally great and realistic to the time. I too feel the cognitive dissonance that as the Union, I can crush the Confederacy in every battle and still take 5 years to conquer Richmond or that as the Confederacy, wiping out the Union Army at Antietam and Gettysburg doesn’t at least bring foreign intervention if not clear victory but that was not the purpose of the game. Adding real strategy and major impacts to the state of the war to the game would make the finely balanced difficulty curve the developers built irrelevant. It would also force the developers to lose realism in other places. If the game was built around the strategy of the war, the early battles would need to become unrealistically difficult for a long, well balanced game. 

The criticism is generally valid as the game certainly creates a sense of cognitive dissonance between how you annihilate your enemy in battle but then they have more troops in the next battle, but if you are thinking about buying the game, consider that the dissonance is not there by accident but rather is the consequence of creating an engaging difficulty curve. 

TL:DR - The reason the campaign feels weird is that it is about the battles rather than the war. Thus, the design focusses on a good difficulty curve rather than strong strategic realism.",1525533899,1525533899,True,69,2,0.866024792194366455,1,True,False,False

PROS: Menus are easy and they work! It gives a nice start to the campaign and the decisions you must make to begin.

Weapons, troops, commanders, maps, historical accuracy, all of it equals a great buy! Win or lose, you keep going, it's just what benefit you get from either outcome.

If you are winning handily, is it better to take a few more casualties, and wipe out the opponet, or is better to just win the battle with the fewest casualities.

I haven't played another civil war game where I had to deal with these issues.  Also, you have to decide how to equip each brigade.  To understand my options, I really had to research and understand the difference in the equipment.  Thankfully, other users have done much of this, and have some usefull guides.  I like learning more about the civil war, and this game encourages me to do that.

It takes a while to learn all the little tricks to playing this game.  There is a good tutorial, but there are so many things going on that I missed a few things.  I played half of my first campaign before I realized how to detached skirmishers.  This is critical to several battles, but I didn't know how to do it, and didn't even know that I didn't know it.  Also, that first campaign, I didn't realize that you could change what units start most battles.

There is one thing that can be frustrating, and that is the ""scaling"" the computer does before a battle.  If you have extra money, and want to bring a bigger army to the battle, the computer will also bring a bigger army.  That is annoying and frustrating at times.  But, if you think about intelligence it sort of makes sense.  If the opponent finds out you are massing troops in an area, they are probably going to move troops to counter your movements. 

If you like a game that has many battles, that makes you decide what to focus on first at the strategic level, that makes you decide how to equip the brigades, and how many and what type of brigades (infantry, cavalry, artillery) in each corp. then this is the game for you.

It has a fairly solid base and plays very similar to the an earlier game from the same developer, Ultimate General: Gettysburg, but this game not only does not bring anything very new to the original game it also brings in a whole lot more frustrating mechanics and taking out a few key things that would have made it better than the original. Let me list down a few of the issues that really irks me and maybe you can decide whether its worth a whole 30 bucks.

Cons:
- Elevation and Terrain of the map
    "" The original game Ultimate General: Gettysburg had a scale on the battlefield map that tells you the elevation of the place your troop would be on, but in this game that feature was taken out completely and replaced with a map viewer that allows you to toggle between a complete top-down view or a wannabe 3D view that tries itself to help you see the elevation. This completely ruins the game from a strategically point of view as it strips the player the ability to tell where your troops is standing in comparison to the AI who would never have this problem. This affects multiple things that forms the basis of the combat in this game from line-of-sight to cover and concealment. Imagine you place multiple artillery on a hill only to find out that it was not elevated and only finding out after you wasted five minutes trying to move your slow as fuck artillery to that location.""

- Combat losses and AI Scaling
    "" The AI in the camapaign does not take loss. Unless said combat takes place on the day after in the same map and battle the AI will never take any losses. I killed a full 15,000 men on the field in the battle of Gaines's Hill only to found out that the AI completely replenishes its troops even as they were supposedly recovering from the former battle. How does the AI get a complete replenishment of their troops when you as the player have to completely replenish your troops everytime you conclude a battle. This cost money and men where both are in short supply especially on a CSA campaign. And one other thing is that the AI's troop count scales accordingly to your army's troop count. So this not only forces you to make a small army but also forces into a situation where you are always outnumbered 3 to 1.""

-Poor description of Concealment and Cover
    "" The cover and concealment mechanic is as wonky as ever. This game and its earlier iteration Ultimate General: Gettysburg always had a crazy idea of what is a cover is. You can place your troop completely and I mean completely with no excess sticking out in the woods only to take a shit ton of loss from an enemy artillery firing at your location because they saw your troop moving from god knows where. Your troop can never get into cover a 100% and fortifications that look on the map to be a small wooden fort provides you close to no cover, even still taking damage from flanking!? How do you get flank when you troop is covering every coner of the fort? I don't know, maybe only the developer can answer. Then when your troop is completely in middle of a city (I'm looking at you Winchester) you get completly smashed as an enemy artillery decides to walk a few unit closer and blast you with cannister completely destroying your troops.""

- Line Formation only
     "" Your troop is always stuck in line formation and there is no way for you to change it from column, square or anything that you would thing that an experience general from the Mexican Civil War would use. You would think the developer would had consider this when making this game instead of having it be completely the same as its predecessors.""

- Accuracy
    "" Accuracy in this game had always been god awful and I can understand that as in the civil war both sides were made from conscripts and volunteers with informal military training. But when your own Naploeon Artillery is having trouble firing at an enemy from say 4 units size away and they are picking you off from miles away you start to really question whether this game was rigged for the AI who was supposedly better and intuitive from most AIs since it was made by an AI modder from a Total War game. I know that accuracy is affected by both Firearms and Efficiency skill and I had both at 60 and 50 respectively, not the best but decent enough in the early game (At Malvern Hill) but I was having trouble firing at enemy artillery. I even had 3 brigades of Napoleons firing at them from a hill overlooking the battlefield at medium range but alas to no avail.""",1523757763,1523758613,False,1,0,0.481343716382980347,1,True,False,False

One thing I did have to adjust too is you aren't in overall charge of the war as was common in other civil war games. It is like you are one of the levels right under say Lee if playing the Confederates. The campaign strategy is outside your scope. You do get to choose whether to play minor actions to support a big fight. The big fights though are a sequence prest for the ""story"" of the war.
One of the other pluses this is one of the few games to make me ""gosh that's alot of guys coming"" and withdraw my artillery. That battle soon collapsed and turns out ended my first Confederacy run. This also made me aware that the between battle logistics and losses matter. The decision of which Corps to place was a big affect as it turns out my tiny barely anybody 3rd Corps was the first to be attacked in that battle, quickly over run and creating a snowball affect.
Another plus is that the maps are detailled presumably to actual US geography. Its not the sort of thing you tend to find in procedurally generatred games or re-use map games like Total War. 
As with any military sim there are some quirks to how things are implemented. Im a little surprised there is no ""horse artillery"" meaning smaller guns meant to move faster. Or mayber there are just only known as the 6 pdr. 
A negtaive for me is the miserable pursuit system. More than once I have gotten my troops to chase routing enemy to come back a few minutes later to see my guys stopped, the enemy reformed and now shooting them as my guys stand in open ground. This even happened with saber cavalry chasing down artillery pieces. The gunners were ""allowed"" to keep moving the guns while guys on horse back chopped at them. Then the horses paused and the gunners set up their guns to fire grapeshot at the horsemen. Okay... that is... kinda glitchy. 
The big fights are really big. Im not sure the game is replayable more than once for Confederate and once Union but there is alot of play time to be had here. I play about 1 big battle every day or so. So this game will be good for some time.

The game had a very solid base, yet they stripped the very core elements that made the success of its predecesor. Holding a position doesn't change anything for the next day if your side didn't held it on that day, meaning you have to retake positions you held because you had to historically, in the dynamic campaign.

The campaign as its nice features it can be fun, but at times it is just annoying. The manpower one gets is far from enough loosing a battle or even a draw means loosing the entire campaign. 
I lost battles because I did not have enough troops to defend the entire length of the front, while having focused a lot of career points on having a smany troops as possible, after only decent looses in previous battles.

This game has a little bit of a learning curve, and somethings can surprise you.  If your a history guy (not just I watch movies about the civil war type of person) then this is a faithful repressentation with a lot of character for the war.

What is really cool is that choices you make impact the progression of the war, and how you setup your command really really maters on the field and off.

Things to know for new players to lessen frustration:

1. Cavalry are not knights, not even close.  You need to pay attention to what they are armed with to best use them.  I often dismounted with my cavalry depending upon what they are carrying.  If you want to cavalry charge hit tired units and try to  time it with a volley from a supporting unit if poossible.  They are great for screwing with the AI's manuevers and outright smoking their artillery (If they draw arillery attention up close expect loses to cannister, and it's weird but two batteries wil try to fire cannister into one another if you leave one free to do so).  You can setup cavalry as shock units, but it's situational not a go to tactic.

2. Skirmishers, there is a reason you can detach skirmishers and take entire untis of them.  They provide a ""screen"" against smaller units and cavalry and good units can really mess up even bigger units with skirmishers.  I used them all the time to flank, and to attack approaching units or sneak behind to kill supply carts and generals.  I often merge them back with their parnet unit if I am expecting a lot of charges to a particualr spot on the line, because bodies is more important for defending when they get close.

3. Union gets better guns, but rebels often dont seem to care.  To clarify that means as a Union commander your going to get better gear more often, but your men wil not be as seasoned or....well nuts.  Brave as badgers rebels are.

4.make sure you upgrade and hire commanders and place them with your units from the barracks.  It greatly improves a units stats, and can mean the difference from a useless artillery battery making a lot of smoke and an artillery battery that can smash other artillery in a duel.

5. DO NOT be fraid to spend influence on requests, and dont forget to sell wargear your not gonna use and upgrade your units gear with stuff you ""rescue"" from battles.  Also try to be on the look out for decent stocks of better guns (1000 or more for line unit armaments), as you might not be able to get them later on and a uunit can only be as big as the number of said gun you want them to field.

6.EDIT: Do yourself a favor and dont put more than 12 artillery pieces in any one unit, they lose effectiveness quickly past 12 when you can just put the extra into another unit.  Sprea artillery out in brigades etc, so if you have to fight with just one etc you have some (same for skirmishers and cav).",1521315276,1521315580,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The campaign side is a bit silly, with mostly random general names & allowing your brigades to get bigger & bigger over the course of the war instead of shrinking due to casualties, and troop numbers & the replacements model are just so strangely arbitrary and arcade gamey it can break the immersion of feeling like it's an actual battle and not just a casual iphone game.  And the weapons purchasing system in between battles is aggravating, the most expensive & effective weapons are basically a liability, I don't think real generals ever had to decide ""Hmm, should I outfit this brigade with modern Springfields but leave everyone else with farmer muskets so I can use them as cannon fodder?""  Historically the Union had almost all their units equipped with mass produced Springfields & rifled cannons by mid-war, and the Confederates had abundant access to Napoleon cannons and Enfield rifle-muskets.  But I never really feel like I can afford the interesting guns in the game, unless I'm already snowballing to an easy victory.   

BUT ALL THAT SAID the gameplay is truly enjoyable and fun, maybe difficult to grasp at first, but after a few sessions I was able to figure out how to dance around with brigades and skirmishers to get flanking & cover bonuses and avoid trading losses, pretty much I can completely wreck armies twice my size with ease now.  And I will admit that the way the scenarios split bigger battles into well defined ""phases"" with local objectives, is a really innovative & interesting take on these done-to-death historical battles.  After ~70 hours playing I still find myself coming back and trying it again as the opposite side or on a new difficulty setting, it's pretty highly replayable.

This is an extremely well crafted American Civil War battle system. The maps and the way terrain is handled are very well done. The graphics are both functional and good. The information displayed in the HUD is what you need to manage the, sometimes huge, battlefield. The are tons of battles both large and small, well known and lesser known. The Grand Battles are truly epic in scale, duration and complexity of forces and geography. You really get a sense of the brawls which were Chickamauga and Stones River!

The Campaign system is excellent. And hard. Choosing commanders, unit specialties, weapons, and designing your Corps makeup are very cool. Customizing YOU, as the overall commander is also very well done. I haven't been able to complete the Campaign on Normal difficulty as yet, even after winning nearly every battle! The attritional aspect of the campaign is grinding...

If you were looking for the ""ultimate"" American Civil War battle game, then you've found it right here.

Highly Recommended.

The thing that's certainly the thing you will play the most is the campaign mod, in which you take over as general of the Union or Coonfereate army and fight historical battles of the war.But there is a twist.You make your own army in a sense that after each battle you get manpower and money with which you can upgrade your army.During battles you lose units which if you carefully manage your resources, you can replenish.You also get emotinally attached to some of the brigades and when they get masacred, you count every casualty in shame and sadness. That is why this game offers something unique. The option to evade this battle. For example in Fredricsburg  as the Union, you can just say nope, I am not attacking that line and lose the battle.But you spare your men from a bloody battle and it can be beeficial to sometimes just say nope.The AI is one of the best i have seen, not by its ingenuity, but by its human behaviour.It makes calcualtions which seem reasonable most of the time and if they see that the battle is lost, they will just retreat and stop attacking even if it didnt take the objective, because it to has an army to take care of.The gameplay was also an experience.The nerveracking major battles can drive you crazy and the risk of getting fired is always over your head.I have never found myself fighting such desperate battles , especially Fredricsburg, where I charged in around 7 times after finally breaking the enemy lines and it didnt feel like a strategy, just a desperate hand to hand combat.And thats what this game makes you feel.You feel like a real genearl in coman of your own troops where each of them has a history, through victory and defeat, blood and steel, from 1st Bull Run to Richmond they fought for you.And it makes you feel like a lsot battle even if you won, because now 30000 men are not with you anymore, they lay dead in the fields of Fredricsburg.

Pros:

Proper unit movement. - Units actually move how they should as opposed to other games where units are like tanks that can only fire one direction where the unit has to turn as a single entity to fire behind them instead of individual soldiers doing an about face

Outfitting firearms for each individual unit - Every unit will be able to adjust what kind of firearm they use. From cannon to rifle. My only complaint would be you can't put on bayonets or swords.

Cons:

Division Aiming - When moving the division, instead of fighting enemy divisions, it fights individually targeted units. 

History can't be changed - But it can be rewritten. Like my biggest problem is you can keep winning and beating the enemy and the enemy doesn't get weaker. The Battle of Bull Run 1 is a great example where I completely destroyed the army. For those of you who aren't history fans, The battle of Bull Run 1 is the first battle in the Civil War and the north got their ass handed to them by the south.

If you enjoy boring your friends about telling them about your heroic defense of some town they never heard of, then this game is for you.  

Pros:
- I like the graphics, though could be better.  The last best civil war simulator that I played that was near this level was the American Civil War which came out in 1991, so... yes, it is an improvement.
- Managing your Army.  You can build your army as you see fit, though Cavalry are useful only for feints and chasing Arty, Generals and supplies.  Anything else and you risk losing them as they melee their way to a corner of the map.  
- Managing your Army.  Losses hurt and cost money.  This makes you make tradeoffs in your approach to war.  You also are limited to how many divisions, brigades you can have so you need to put some thought into the army.
- Managing your Armory.  Best weapons cost so don’t give them to your troops who will end up being decimated.  
- Some of the issues noted in early comments have been fixed.  I have not been ""teleported"" at the end of a phase. 
- (Added 27Feb18) AI seems to be adept at ""learning"" as now seems to keep at least a 300 man skirmisher or 800 Bde around their supplies and arty.  No more easy Cav runs to take out their supply trains.   

Cons:
- Save your troops and don't risk lives unnecessarily as no matter how much you decimate their army, they always get more. 
- AI appears incompetent, but that is a trick.   The other side can charge and do double quick with no loss in effectiveness.  They can be routed, but they will be back as they regain morale to the point that a 800 brigade is still fighting with 96 men.
- Cavalry will not ""break"" a line.  However, the AI thinks they can and will wheel entire formations to face the charge, so you are left with using them as a paper tiger. 


One potential pro/con is the fact that the AI makes every battle even.  This is good to keep people interested, but is totally unrealistic.  I want to fight unfair battles, I want to crush their armies to never rise again, I want it to be a walk in the park, but.......once you ""win"" a game, it becomes boring.

Unit management is satisfying. Forged my own Iron Brigade and ""Berdans Sharpshooters"". I learned to save my units from suffering heavy casualties, cause i like the boys. For some reason Winfield Hancock get woundet quite often. So i had to restard the battles sometimes just because of that.

Start my next campaign on Medium for the CSA. 

For misfortune this game is not the successor of Sid Meiers Gettysburg, but it comes as closest from civil war games released since then.
The Division and Corps movement on Battlefield could work better, especial after you released some skirmishers.
Charges on Arty dont seem to work as intended. 
Only thing what could really spoil the fun is the interruption of a big battle into sequences. Where your units position resetted to historical correct positions after a set time but you already payed with blood to gain the good positions.

I got the Army of Northern Virginia down do Divisional strength, so Day 3 at Gettysburg was.... just Picketts division attempted a charge vs 50.000 Yanks. Well....

When playing as the Union, the game plays in a way that's more or less logical.  If you crush the Confederates, they keep fighting but you develop an overwhelming superiority in numbers and men - more or less what happened after 1863, just slower.  I can easily grind down the Confederacy assuming I get past Fredricksburg more or less OK, even on higher difficulties.    
When playing as the Confederacy, the game feels broken because you can string together a series of astonishing victories and still be at a severe disadvantage in the late game.  To some extent, this is probably accurate, emulating what Shelby Foote described as the Union ""taking [its] other hand out from behind its back"".  But if you won Antietam and Gettysburg, you almost certainly would have received aid from the British and French.  
Without going too deep into what the game isn't - a grand strategy with domestic and international politics - the game could emulate this by giving the Confederacy access to more and better weapons and/or foreign volunteer regiments with a high enough war score late in the game.
I mean, from a historical plausability perspective, the South would likely have surrendered had they lost Bull Run and the Peninsula campaign badly, and Lincoln almost certainly would have lost the 1864 election had he gone in with a string of losses at Fredricksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg.

Pros:
-The game is set in the American Civil War, which is a war that not everyone knows a lot about.
-There is a lot of strategy involved, and it’s fun to be a war general that plans out attacks and manages resources.
-It is definitely a challenging game, so if you want a game that will challenge your tactics, this is a good choice.

Cons:
-There are a lot of keys that have in-game functions, and not all of the functions make sense for where they’re located on the keyboard. This can be slightly annoying when first starting out.
-All of the in-battle commands are complex and tedious to carry out, making it very frustrating to do even the simpliest of tasks (retreat, hold fire, split army, etc.)
-The in-game tutorial is lackluster and fails to teach you many of the basic game functions.
-The AI of the units is very poor at times.

Now, the first few battles are amazingly wonderfully fun. You get to build your army, get new weapons, blah blah blah. And then the real battles start to kick in. 
              Now I was playing easy mode because, well, I had just bought the game and I didn't know the mechanics very well. And to be honest - I got bitch slapped by the AI. And it's not because I'm new to these types of games. I literally have almost every Total War Game and I have hundreds of hours on them. 
                Each battle sorta goes like this: ""Well, I feel pretty good. The rebs are advancing and I got my arty pounding on em. I think I'll win.""
                   ""Oh shit. That was close. Just got charged by the rebs but I'm all repgrouped now and I got reinforcements to aid me. I still have a good chance.""
                      ""MOTHERFUCKER. WhErE TeH fUcK DiD 18,000 MoRe rEbS cOmE fRoM.""
And this has been the past 5 battles for me. And I know you can't win all of them, but when you're completely outgunned and outmanned by a 2:1 ratio, it really gets to you. I hope they fix this issue because the ideal strategy game is one where the AI makes you work for your victory and actually requires you use your brain. This one, however, just makes you sit and stare at the computer for half an hour watching your men get shot up sitting in the same damn location forever. And then they break and flee. It's not like total war where you have complex manouvers of moving up skirmishers and postitioning arty and making cav charges to the flanks. The troops are slow moving and it's unbearable.

---------------

Edit: So it's been more than a year since I wrote my initial review, and I've played this game a lot more since then. Overall, it's a pretty solid game. I love how completely destroying your opponent's army has a lasting effect on them throughout the game in that their numbers are depleted for the next few battles. There are still some things that piss me off, though. Cover is way too over powered, as well as small units for some reason. There is no way a 500 man brigade behind cover can hold of my 2500 man 3 star veteran brigade. Utter bs. Even when I charge, with my melee stat at 100. I also hate the morale system. Units break and flee so often that it's not even fun. You have them march up to a fort, they lose 200 out of their 2500 man unit in one volley so they retreat to halfway across the battlefield. Ridiculous. And keep in mind that they severely outnumber the number of troops within the fort, yet they can get about 20 kills and that's it.

The point is, if you like seeing your army being slaughtered by an outnumbered enemy for no reason other than subpar battle design, then this game is for you.",1481951137,1518901067,False,10,1,0.511016666889190674,5,True,False,False

First of all, I bought this game as an early access titule. 

I have been following the official forum and even posting there. The good thing is, there was, and still is an active community. The bad thing is the fact, that the DEVelopers have their own fuzzy vision of the game. Nick Thomadis the main person responsible for this production is not only blind, but also deaf. Players suggestions and ideas are being completely ignored. 

The main reason why I wrote a red review previously [and now I am updating it] and stated that hardly nothing changed here, is because It is a fact. The only new game content that was added, are side missions, and main missions. Thats it. There are tons of bugs, that we had to deal with since the very first released. Apparently the DEV announced a ""release"", sorry, I beg to differ. As for me, and I am sure a lot of other players will agree, game is nothing else but still an early access experience.

If I was to write a list of all the issues that Ultimate General: Civil War has, that would be longer than The Lord of the Rings written by John Ronald Reuel Tolkien.

If you are interested in Civil War, and would like to purchase this game to enjoy the campaign, know this, it is scripted, from the very first click you make. You will barely have any freedom. This titule was not meant for you to enjoy it, like the Total War games, it was made to recreate the battles that took part. 

Thats right. You get to experience what happened. Every single mission has a time limit, a very short one, which is forcing you play the game in a specific way. Imagine that you are in the middle of a battle, band bang, boom boom... then suddenly it is all over, because... there is no more time. I mean, seriously, what the fuck? I can not recall how mant times did I find myself in a camp because of the time limit. I want to keep on playing, decimate enemies, leave not even one standing. That unforunately is impossible. I want to use tactics, etc., I can not. You either get to rush forward, or defend. 

The latter the battle, the worst it is. Some are divided into parts. You have couple seconds to charge the left flank, then a magic teleportation to the right flank, and once again, now to the center. I hate it. Campaign has nothing to do with campaign. It is a bunch of missions that you complete exactly in the same order, pretty much the same way. Sure, you have a bit of field to maneuver, but if it takes to long, then prepare for defeat, and restart.

Is that how a game is supposed to look like? No. There are plenty issues, mistakes, just a poorly made game. The idea is okay, but when it comes to execution, it leaves a lot of room for improvements.

Get rid of the fucking time limit! For fuck sake.

1.09 is out, and still bugged. You can not name your saves as numbers, because then if you try to load them, you will end up in a camp. They sometimes work though, but it is more than a lottery.",1500232250,1518508322,False,4,2,0.523636341094970703,1,True,False,False

I'd like to think the people who made this game drew inspiration from CWG2, because I certainly see that they took care of details just as much as that 1997 game.

I'm enjoying the Campaign mode where each scenario involves, most times, smaller skirmishes that can help set up the bigger events in your favour. I love how larger battles composed of different important moments are dealt with, with the focus switching from side to side even amidst the fight (first example I loved about this approach was the Battle of Shiloh). I also appreciated that, when there's battles that span through different days, you are allowed to go to the ""camp"" menu to manage your brigades, with due limitations of course.

Everyone who has ever read a history of the American Civil War will stop at one point or another and ask themselves how things could have gone differently.

[i]Ultimate General: Civil War[/i] does not answer that question.

In its first few hours, the game is a sure winner. The scenery is gorgeous and well-modeled, the tactics fun, and it's easy to lose track of time as you figure out winning strategies on each battlefield.

The longer you play, the more the game's flaws come out. Eventually, you realize the biggest flaw of all: What you do doesn't really matter.

[i]Ultimate General: Civil War[/i] runs into the walls that most historic games face. By hewing too closely to history, they deny the player his or her agency. Everything is fated.

So what if the Confederates win on the first day of Gettysburg? The Union forces will rebound and the Confederate player finds themselves fighting battles farther and farther south.
Pursue the Army of Northern Virginia to ultimate destruction as a Union player on the third day of Gettysburg? It doesn't matter. The Confederacy will miraculously find tens of thousands more soldiers to fill its ranks.
This game, while beautiful, is a handful of tiny sandboxes with only a limited path between. The player does not get to choose where to fight his or her battles, and his or her successes rarely matter.

A papier-mache fictional final series of battles for the Confederate campaign doesn't do much to fix this problem. By the time you reach that point, you'll have already become frustrated with the structure.

It's enormously disappointing, because it only needs a good campaign layer to fix these problems, then the courage to be willing to end the campaign early. Win Bull Run overwelmingly? You could end the war in 1861. Win Antietam as the Confederacy? The war ends in 1862 after the French and British recognize the Confederacy.

If you enjoy playing the historical battles, you'll likely enjoy this game, but you may be frustrated by a handful of bugs -- regiments that become stuck in rivers or on map borders are the worst of these. The game also fails to correctly model repeating weapons: A regiment armed with Henry or Spencer rifles fires no more quickly than one armed with a Springfield.

If you find yourself satisfied by history, you may find something to enjoy here. If, however, you're looking for the answer to ""what if,"" you won't find it here.",1517707824,1517708002,False,320,11,0.85416024923324585,28,True,False,False

First, the good. This is the probably the best tactical simulation that I've played. It hands down beats Total War, is intuitive, and is generally a pretty solid game all around.

The bad: I'm going to write a little more here. Firstly, the campaign is in need of rebalancing. It doesn't matter if you completely destroy the opposite army; they'll be back at full strength for the next fight. There were 70,000 Confederate casualties at Chickamauga, versus 20,000 Union, but it doesn't mean anything. Your army will still be shot up for the next battle, while there's will be at full strength.

This is to compensate for poor AI. There is no sense of self-preservation. A real commander will not commit failed attack after failed attack - imagine if Pickett's charge had been repeated a second, and then a third time. This is a problem I've seen time and again from the AI. At Chickamauga, there were only 85,000 Confederates total.

The lack of any multiplayer option is pretty significant as well given the poor AI.

The last criticism is a lack of tooltips, or any other explanation of what various characteristics do. As an example, it's never clearly explained what efficiency of a unit is - does this affect movement speed, reloading times, resistance to morale shocks, or something else entirely? How is this really effected by giving another weapon (which has its own efficicency rating) to a brigage ?",1517195421,1517195421,False,8,0,0.567887008190155029,1,True,False,False

First of all the first mission (which is basically the tutorial) is way too damn hard, it's just plain stupid how the devs expect you to fight and win when you are already outnumbered by a third and they have superior firepower and extra divisons to flank. BY THE WAY, this is the FIrst Mission!!!! This has happened to me on the Union and the Confederacy many times and I have to try again and again to win. But what pisses me off is that if you lose the tutorial you lose the whole game, but if you lose a actual battle in the campain its a minor setback and you continue to play unless you lose to much, what logic is this??? It contradicts the main point of the game that you win some and lose some, but reguardless you continue on. What's funny however, is the fact I have no problem in the actually campain and find it relatively easy because I can develop my own army and develop it to my play style. All Im saying is that they need to tone down the first mission or allow the player to continue the game. If in their mind they are tring to convey the message that this game is not gonna be a breeze and represents that war is a constant struggle between everything from defeat and victory. This is by far my largest complaint.

Some minor but not main killers like the previous one are some game mechanics. First of all cavalry, cavalry works pretty well but I have a few complaints. First of all why is it that skirmishers run as fast as my cavalry. I get pissed off when I charge my cavalry against skirmishers and they get away, why! They don't even get routed, and in the occasion they do I kill thirty and then they get stuck in the corner of the map and start a melee battle and I end up losing half my cavalry (this is with any unit in reality). This makes no sense. Fix it. Secondly Skirmishers need some fixes too. I understand the fact that they are designed to harrass, yet in battle sometimes units need to be used for emergency situations. In my case why is it they fire and retreat when I tell them to hold the line. Sometimes I need them to actually act like line infantry, they need a button like in total war where I can turn off their ability to fire and retreat. With these problems it makes skirmisher units useless and your better off just spaming line infantry units.",1515886022,1515886230,False,6,2,0.495691180229187012,0,True,False,False

But when i started to play, I was instantly sucked in and within the first three or two battles i knew i love it! Seriously this game is worth the 27,99 € and honestly i think it is worth more than the money that are the developers asking for it. So let me just briefly cover the stuff the game has and does great point by point. So here we go.

1. The Army building.
After the introduction into the game in form of your first battle you find youself on the strategic map of the US east coast and in command of your own army comprised of brigades and htey are organized into divisions, which form the main parts of your army that are sent into battles, the corps.
In order to form your army, you will also have to form seperate brigades and equip each with weapons, men and get a commander to lead it. There are many weapons from smooth muskets to rifled mustets to, long revolvers, sabres (for cavalry only), pistols, scoped rifles and magazined rifles. Each has its pros and conns. For example a domestically produced rifle of texan origin will be very good, but it will be more expensive and  most of the time, there are gonna be only very few on the market, so you wont be able to properly equip your brigades with it, or you will get into a situation when you will be forced to replace the said rifle, becouse there just isnt enough of them to replace the ones lost during the last battle. 
So the army building aspect is very nice and it involves some basic economy (you can sell your suff, or the stuff you captured from the other guys).

2.Battles them self.
Battles take place on very well done and beautiful maps and can be quite challanging and can be also very long with multiple stages and objectives. Also there are many smaller battles that all have some effect on your enemy and especially the big battles can have long-lasting consequences. You will meet well know generals on the field standing against you or you can employ some of them in your onw army. Sometimes you will be able to capture some enemy brigades in battle and exchange them for men after the fight.
So the Fights are great, satisfying and just amazing to watch as well.

3. Politics and personal prestige + expirience.
And now the last part. After winnig battles your renown as a general will raise and this will give you a chance to request additional weapons, expirienced generals (Lee, Grant and others), recruits or money from your goverment. Also as you continue through the game you will be able improve your skills in reconnaisence, army organisation, medidine and so on.

4.Final verdict.
So to summarize this game. It's great. It has great historic battles, great level of customatization, financial strategy and field tactics. And though it is a linear expirience (not that much choice in terms of battles) it is better that way. I would say this is probably the best formation warfare tactics game i have ever played and believe me, i played ton and this one beats them all, even though maybe not in the level of micro detail (meaning individual soldiers). So I would advise you to buy this, becouse if you like tactical games you will love it and if you are new to tactical and strategic games, there is a difficulty setting and you can get introduced to the genre with this one fairly well. And also supporting these developers gives us a chance to maybe see a new great game from them one day from a different war.",1515257838,1515257838,True,1,0,0.501716732978820801,0,True,False,False

I think this games tries to do two conflicting things and fails at both.
1) I think it tries to put you in charge of the American Civil War, to potentialle change the course of history. Which would be pretty cool, only 2) it also rail roads your campaign so that you can experience the American Civil War and the battles first hand.

My recommendation to the devs would be do one or the other. Full on tactical game following the history or a free form campaign ala Total War for that Hybrid strategy/tactics or Europa Universalis for the strategy.

My recommendation to you. Unless you are big into the American Civil War do not buy this.


The Setting.
Let me start off by saying I am not an American civil wars buff, which, reading other reviews, is a big reason people like this game scewing the review towards positives. I get it, if you are nuts about that period, this allows you to experience battles and drama that unfolded during those years.

The Campaign. -
You should know going into this that you will not be able to forge your very own path through the civil war like choosing were, when and to a large part how to fight. The campaign is on rails for the most part first you are faced with scenarios A, B and C all of which you must overcome before proceeding onto D, E, and F. I think a free form campaign would be better left to a modded version of Total War Empires focussing solely on this period if you want the battles and if you dont want the battles maybe a modded version of Europa Universalis IV.

The Campaign Battles. +
Honestly, I like the scripted nature of the battles it brings each scenario to life. I do find it a little weird that you get to have your own personal retinue of super soldiers, which gains xp and better rifles. Cool, but in conjunction with the scripted battles it just seems off.

Tactical Game Play -
For a game that has such a high focus on the tactical element of battle it just wasnt compelling enough the battles really dragged out with two sides sitting in decent cover just shooting it out. The AI too poor to use its superior numbers to get a decent flank on and you two low on numbers to risk breaking out of cover. I have had to chase infantry with infantry across entire maps becuase both sides are too exhausted to engage in melee. I cant change the width/depth of my units to that I can fit them into that square corn field or long narrow forrested area. The level of information available also limits the tactical depth of the game, see UI and Tutorial.

Multiplayer. -
Maybe some of the problem with having battles that drag out could be mitigated when fighting other players and clearly established victory conditions (unlike Total War Shogun 2 were there would be no timer even if you were defending a castle...). Unfortunately there is no multiplayer.

Graphics. -
Not great honestly, but decent. It is no Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, but neither is it Total War Warhammer. I have already mentioned that I play EU IV, so no I dont think strategy games need good graphics, but this game would really benifit from better ones especially since it shines on the same tactics level that Total War does.

UI. -
Honestly terrible, well maybe not Surgeon simulator levels of frustration, but again it felt clunky and akward moving your troops about. The tool tips are really small same with the manual. I would have loved to be able to tell what was actually a hill from a conture overlay and see the line of sight for my artillery and other units. How about a map that shows you cover levels and the extend of those regions at a glance, heavily wooded, lightly, fields, towns etc. Do units located in the forest get a penalty shooting out of the forrest? What are the modifiers affecting my units right now and what is their effectiveness in fighting the unit it is currently shooting at. 

Tutorial. -
There simply isnt any. The game is fairly simple, but you kinda have to just learn or potentially read in the manual see UI. For instance, a wavering units cannot be controlled. Moral damage from flank, rear attacks. Capturing supply carts. Units will keep fireing when you tell them to move forward if there are enemies in range only advancing when reloading. Tons of little things. Also it takes such a long time to figure out what this game really is that you cant refund it once you have.",1515149117,1515149223,False,6,0,0.536842107772827148,0,True,False,False

-Battles Mechanics:While there are mulitple strategies to win battles, Terrain/Cover and Flanking are the paramount factors for this game. Try to bum rush a fortified position and you'll know exactly how Burnside felt at Federicksburg. Major Battles can be broken down into several days/phases in respect to historical accuracy, but not always depending on Players' action (ex: I won Cold Harbour on Phase/Day One). Casualties inflicted on enemy Brigades are persistent and can swing the battle in your favour on the following days. (My Pickett's Charge involved one severely undermanned brigade and 1 artillery battery). Though there are flaws to this game that might ruin the experience for players. The Fortification System for AI is completely rigged, they will put out inordinate amount of firepower and can take charges outnumbering them 3 to 1 odds. While when the player gets into fortification, one good charge will see your position overrun. Cavalry are fairly crap if the player don't micro them. THIS IS NOT TOTAL WAR, cav charges are next to useless, use them to flank, dismount and fire into the enemy rear. Late game, players will find increasing difficulty to manage battles as the different corps under your command are pressed into the battlefield. It might be a necessity for those who are new to RTS to use their Corp AI. Unfortunately it is a limited AI, that only have TWO commands (Attack/Defend) and will maul your forces as they blindly charge into entrenched positions without much strategic mindset. Another mechanic that players need to be aware of is the Rout Mechanic. You will never see a routing unit being chased off the field of battle unless it is completely shattered. Chasing these units does nothing but open holes in your lines for the others to take advantage of. Enemy Units are KNOWN to rout and flee past your unit and reform at your rear which it would then decimate your brigade.

-Army Management: War cost Treasure, and Treasure are begotten through Victories (or at least Close Defeats). You will start out small with a handful of poorly armed brigades, levying/begging political favours back home to bolster your army through success! or failure. Each Battle, regardless of outcome will net you some manpower, cash and political clout that will allow you to increase your army size and buy better equipment. In the Late Campaigns, your army  can go up to 5 Corps with 25 individual Brigades each. The player have an incredible amount of freedom when it comes to army composition and quality. From making an elite corp of death dealing firing line that can outshoot any adversary to making a literal human tidal wave of raw recruits that can't even shoot a target 3 feet away from them (but they can sure as hell bludgeon their enemies to death). Depending on difficulty, your opponent's resources might be onesided, and if not decisively crippled in battle will severely hamper your future campaigns. 

Overall gameplay: Despite some of glaring flaws, it is by no means broken. It challenges players to develop new tactics to tackle some of these issues, or at least crack open wikipedia and study the battle they're fighting in detail to figure it out. I would say this is a more of a tactical game. Most of the strategy are usually laid out for you in the Battle Briefs and there is not much leeway when it comes to these victory conditions. Even if you completely shatter your enemy if those objectives are not taken, you will Lose/Draw. For those who likes to pick their battles, this game might not be your cup of tea as both campaigns are quite linear, One Major Battle and several smaller ones.

Is it perfect? No. No game is perfect, but this game is superb.

This game will let you win (or lose) the Civil War. You can play both sides, in three different difficulties. 

Why do I love it so much? Let me explain:
1. It's the Civil War. If you enjoy learing about the Civil War as much as I do, this game is for you.
2. Large scale RTS game. I've never played anything like it. The largest army I have wielded on the battlefield has been about 80,000 troops. Big numbers. 
3. The management/customization. Watch as your brigades evolve and become more experienced. Manage their weapons, skills, and unit size. Command them across the battlefield, using different strategies and tactics to outwit the enemy. Or crush them with overwhelming manpower. 
4. Basically the freedom the game gives you. Are the battles scripted? Kinda, but aside from assigning objectives and giving hints, you are free to do as you please.

Are there things I don't like? Of course. But they are quite minor.
1. Brigades can only face one way, and are easily flanked. I wish they could oblique, or turn part of the brigade to defend the flank. 
2. I wish we could zoom in more.
3. Division Names???
4. Defensive fortifications only appear in certain parts, and I wish we could make our troops build them, or at least spread out to cover a larger area.
5. Campaign wise, in multi-day battles, unit continuity is nonexistant. Meaning, when the game advances to the next day, it rearranges your units. Pretty minor issue.

It's pretty simple. I recommend this game wholeheartedly. The minor flaws are exactly that: minor. The game is a gem. If you like RTS games or the civil war, this game is for you.

I have had a lot of fun in the campaigns on both sides North and South. Some times the missions can be tedious but usually they are extremely fun. The way divisions are organized and have to be supplied add the extra amount of depth to the game that make me feel like I truly am a general that needs to supply his troops. The campaign also has an intresting way of developing your character in the beginning by picking your background and increasing traits of you and your officers as you progress through the war. If you want to have an intresting experience I highly suggest giving this game a try and it's precurser title, Ultimate General: Gettysburg, but if you truly want the full campaign and wider scope experience pick this one up first.",1515035425,1515035425,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really enjoyed the game and expect it to be on my computer for a long time.  They've really done a nice job recreating the battlefields.  Honestly, it is good enough that I recommend it for anyone whose about to visit one of the battlefields recreated in the game.  I found myself picturing the battlefields as the game played out and it is certainly better than imagining arrows on a map.

That drive to attain historical accuracy does hinder the campaign game in quite a few ways.  You start with a small group of raw recruits and slowly build them into a group of veterans, adding more divisions and corps as you win battles.  Unfortunately it's easy to game the system once you understand how it works.  Winning a battle gives you money, men, and reputation but some battles are harder than others.  For my first playthough I chose the Union and because I've read the history, I knew the futility of doing things like charging the lines at Fredricksburg.  After one halfhearted attempt I held back and won by focusing my attack somewhere else.  Even people who don't know history will learn that lesson quick which really hurts the game's replayability.

The same thing happens when you fight at Chancellorsville.  Your whole army is spread out and facing east as it did historically.  The game's messages tell you to focus your attack east but anyone that has read about the battle knows Stonewall Jackson is behind your lines.  To make it fairer, I waited for him to show up then moved to troops to intercept.  That was much more fun but I shouldn't have advanced information about the battle.  More variety in battles like this would make repeat playthoughs feel less like a waste of time.

Another issue is the game design puts all the battles on rails and even if you win battles your historical counterpart lost, it really doesn't matter.  You advance to the next battle no matter how many casualties you take or cause.  As your army gets more experience the opposition magically gets even more experienced to account for the difference.  I just finished Gettysburg and by now I'm pretty sure I've killed more men than actually served in the actual Confederacy.  Next battle I'm sure Lee will be back to full strength with veteran leaders and skilled men.  This really lessens my desire to push troops other than to stop at mission goals.  There's no need to anything else because you face the same army either way.  Doing more only weakens you in the future.

This game does comes real close to being strategically great on the battlefield.  I think my favorite so far is 2nd Bull Run where you have to send out skirmishers and cavalry to find an isolated part of the Confederate army.  This mission really reinforces why scouting was so important during the Napoleonic warfare.  Once you find the enemy it's a race to link your army as fast as possible and then hit the isolated army as hard as you can before the rest of Lee's army arrives.

This really pushes the risk vs reward along with uncertainty.  Unfortunately this doesn't happen with most battles.  You are usually put into a situation just before armies meet and it's just a matter of seeing the opponent and deciding whether to defend or attack.  It gets old but I'm sure it is difficult to program a stategically smart AI on a huge map.  If you give the computer too many decisions, most human player usually can beat it with cheap tactics.  This problem is the bane of all wargames so it probably isn't fair to criticize too much for this failing.

Even knowing that, I'd still like more ability to choice where to fight.  What would happen if I let Lee take Gettysburg and fight him closer to Washington?  Why can't we get a game that can similate battles as brigades/divisions/corps move around the map?  Why can't we create generated battles based on a general understanding of the maps of the United States from that era?  Why not allow me to fight where ever I want and adjust things like the overall population / technology to help with the what-ifs?  The Confederacy was always at a huge disadvantage so if the Union generals are competent they are destined to win early.  That's ok in a simulation.  Let us change the game assumptions and restart.  Instead this game resorts to cheap tricks to keep everything stuck on the historical path.  

I know this review sounds negative but even with its flaws it is a huge improvement over most wargames.  Just because Pickett's charge is preprogrammed at Gettysburg does not make that experience any less spine chilling.  Like I said at the beginning, this wargame is a great overview of battles and there's something exhilerating to watch your forces fighting on famous battlegrounds.  It really gives a good overview of the terrain and gives insight into why commanders made certain decisions.  

In the long run I doubt I play the campaign more than a couple of times but I'm sure the historical battles (12 major and 16 minor)  will be a long term part of my wargame rotation for whenever I feel the desire.  This game is a good investment if you are at all interested in the American Civil War or wargaming in general.  

I also can't wait to see what the development team for this game does next.  I'm sure they learned a lot from this experience and hopefully we see more advancements so we eventually can get a game that is a better blend of strategy/tactics.",1515035141,1515035141,True,0,0,0.49386143684387207,0,True,False,False

Has a real feel for the perceived difficulties of the period, including the strategic balance of green troops, modern weapons, preserving veteran troops, political popularity, etc.

Tactically it is enjoyable, but over the full length of the campaign can become monotonous. Pin the enemy infantry with detached skirmishers, throw multiple regiments at the end regiment of the opponent's battle line, shoot him to routing and work up the line. Getting a skirmisher behind his end regiment works well, and then go hunting artillery with micro management. Hold your elite regiments in reserve to push hard for the scenario objective if you are pushed for time, or fill holes in your battleline.

Within the first few hours of play it became apparent that my enemy was not the Confederate States of America, or even the supposedly advanced AI, but rather the Clock.  I lost count of the number of times I carefully maneuvered my men into advantageous positions, utilizing the admittedly wonderful route planning features, to set complex assaults in motion; only to meet with failure despite the Rebels fleeing in disarray because the timer ran out.  By the third time you reload to win a battle you had dominated with manuever, tactics and strategy in order to win by weight of numbers alone the game will start to lose it's luster.

Complicating this are some truly glaring mistakes which defy all versimilitude.  Artillery, the King of Battle, for instance becomes useless without time for bombardment to provoke natural evolutions in positioning which can be taken advantage of.  In defensive actions it's maddening to watch as your cannons belch cannister shot directly into the melee without the defenders suffering any collateral damage.  Ditto for the ability to enfilade friendly forces to great effect.
Far from putting positional advantage within reach Cavalry units collapse the moment they enter the range of even the most numerically inferior blocking forces' guns.  Skirmishers, while incredibly useful in early battles suffer from a dearth of supply as the game progresses, ultimately becoming useless since the superior weaponry that they naturally rely on (such as scoped and repeating rifles) never become available in numbers which scale to match the increasing unit sizes.

Perhaps the worst aspect of this experience is that there is no reward for undertaking it.  Completing the Campaign does not unlock anything to incentivize you to play again.

I can't reccomend a strategy game where your units only loosely pay attention to orders.... sometime.... if they feel like it.... for a few seconds before changing their mind and doing whatever they feel like (usually dying pointlessly because they want to wheel around and get flanked or retreat from a vastly inferiour enemy who's already running away).",1513980204,1513980204,False,7,1,0.440894126892089844,3,True,False,False

Pros: 
- Looks Great
- You don't have to win every battle in the campaign (which contributes to realism)
- Your armies are completely customizable-- you get to pick exactly how many men are in each unit, how many divisions you'll have, what kind of units you'll have, and even what they're named. You want an infantry unit with 1719 guys running around with farmer's rifles named Dave's Ass? You can have that. 
- VERY user friendly. If you're new to rts games, this will help you catch on fairly quickly. If you're experienced, you'll enjoy the various nuances of the game.

Cons: 
- Calvary are underpowered in general, but especially ranged calvary. They'll take one shot at the enemy, then immediately turn around and retreat. 
- Charges were a big part of the civil war, and were known for being very effective. In this game, however, the charging unit will almost always rout before whomever they charged at, even under the best conditions. 

Overall, I really liked this game. It's realistic enough to make it challenging without forcing you to micromanage every little thing. It's also really good at surprising you-- just when you think you've outmanuvered your opponent, something will change on the battlefield to make you sweat.

This is really a fantastic tactical game. The developers have really polished up the game since Early Access and resolved a lot of the concerns people had earlier. The AI has improved by leaps and bounds, making maneuvering your army ever more critical to success. It's painfully rare for realtime strategy games to truly reflect the importance of good terrain, flanking, and morale as this game does. To win decisively you must make bold maneuvers, but at the same time a wrong move can result in tremendous losses. Each move has to be carefully weighed.

The strategic campaign aspect really goes hand in hand with the battles. Replacing your armies is expensive, so those casualties you take really hurt. However the reinforcements of your enemy are limited as well, so if you can inflict enough damage on them, you can save a lot of heartache later on. It's another tradeoff; do you risk taking extra losses to weaken your enemy, or do you focus on preserving your army?

There are dozens of playable battles that rapidly grow in scope as the game progresses. By the end, you engage in massive battles involving several dozen brigades stretched across battlefields large enough that you can't just reinforce from one part of your army to the other. Careful advanced planning is critical for victory. The battles are historically based, but offer just enough leeway that I don't really feel constrained.

So, therefore this game stands almost zero chance of getting anything but a great review from me. Now, all that said, when I actually began playing this game, I found it to be as exceptional as I had hoped it would be. This is a kind of grand strategy game (ish) with your management of your Army and skill points outside the battlefield. Decisions have to be made, resources (which can be sort of sparse (particularly Army/unit leadership resources) have to be managed well, etc. And then within that grand strategy is the actual RTS battles themselves. This is where the game really shines (although truth be told, I'm a dork for the management side of my Army -- research to name every brigade after a historical unit, etc). The game, inside the battle itself is unforgiving. Make a mistake and the AI WILL take advantage of it. The higher the difficulty level you play at, the more formidable and punishing your mistakes will be magnified. This game will teach you real fast, the value of maintaining cover at all possible costs, covering your flanks effectively, establishing a good solid battle line, proper deployment of your experienced troops vs your green troops, along with many other things.

While I still remember spending countless hours playing Sierra's Caesar 3 way back in the day, as well as the orginal Rome:Total War, I was encouraged to find that there are still some great quality strategy war games being made. 

While I had never played the first version of Ultimate General, I had stumbled upon this game many months ago during the Beta release. Coordinating your armies can be a daunting task unless you have a good idea of how you want to engage your troops. This game allows you to detach skirmishers from your regiments and re-attach them at your convenience. Soldiers may become fatigued, lose morale, or run out of ammo during battle, but if you are well organized you may position re-inforcements to take their place. One way you can replace tired troops is by selecting the ""Fallback"" feature which many strategy games lack. Your troops can disengage properly without receiving a devastating volley from the enemy and they cover their retreat in an organized fashion.

I feel that there are many positives to this game, too many to list. 

The only negative, at this time, I can think of would be this; Prior to any battle, the game shows you where your troops and the enemy will be deployed, where re-inforcements will come from, and what locations must be captured or defended. It is very important to remember this information, however, when you are in a large battle and you sometimes don't finish the battle in one sitting, It would be beneficial to be able to have the option to review that information the next time you load your campaign. (Sort of how Age of Empires 3 did)

I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of AOE, Total War, and the early Sierra games like Pharoah, Zeus, or Caesar. It has nothing to do with city building, but plenty to do with warfare and maintenence.",1512540190,1512540266,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One thing I really enjoy about the game is the persistent army from battle to battle, making your choices really impact your overall success. But with that, and maybe I'm missing something, that persistence doesn't really seem to affect the AI army. 

I'm playing as the Confederates for my first go and I have won every battle on the default difficulty gearing up for Antietam because I know that fight is going to be a hard one. But with that, I have on several occasions made a point to ground the enemy army into a fine digestible pulp, at some extra loss to me of course. I considered that the extra weapons gained and intense enemy losses would offset further engagements to my advantage, therefore the slightly higher casualty rate was justified. I especially targeted 3 star commanders and gun batteries to curb their ability to overwhelm my lines with combined arms.

Now we're at the battle of Antietam and I can pretty safely say that the extra effort has made no difference at all. The Yankee dogs have tons of top of the line generals and high end guns pounding my poor 50,000 troops with a big blue hammer. During the first two days of the battle, the blue coats were rounded up and pincered in ever increasing massive blue mounds of dead. Then the third day comes where the union gets some 20,000 ish reinforcements to push their army to now at least twice the size of my remaining forces where I need to hold out for an additional 4 (in-game) hours.

So, overall, good game. But I don't think you should spend much more effort than what it takes to win the battles because it doesn't seem that the AI is playing the same game, and what you save in troop replacements, you can put to buying better guns. So that's my only real complaint, I'm sure it's just for difficulty scaling to keep the game challenging but it makes the individual battles a lot less meaningful.

The battles are great and I enjoy them much more than total war. There are some points though that should be noted and changes I would like to see; 
1. Troops movment speed is too high. probably to keep the game moving but I would like a sim option.
2. Switiching leaders is not possible if all your leader slots are filled.
3. Moving division around is not possible if all slots are filled.
4. Promotions happen too quickly so your lowly major is soon a brigader in charge of the same regiment. I would like to see an authentic promotion system so a regiment can only be commanded by say a major or lt-col.
5. No mixed weapon units. This annoying when resorces are low but you cannot utilise those 500 rifles cos there not quite the right type for your infantry.

I've only played this game a little so far but I've found it to be well worth the money.

When I first encountered the game, the first impression was that it's ""pretty simple"" because it only has Infantry, Skirmisher, Cavalry and Artillery. But as soon as you start playing it, you notice how much depth it has. Especially the part between the battles is pretty important. How do I spend my career points? Politics for more troops/money or shall I invent into medicine, economics? Shall I get 2000 rookie soldiers or invest into fewer, but better veterans? Or some of the expensive cavalry? What weapon will I give them. So managing your army before and after a battle is quite in important task. Also during the battle, it's crucial which troops you send in first. Maybe better send in the cheap, unexperienced guys which are ""easy to replace"". Once the enemy is already demoralized, bring in your 3 star troops. Having a unit who killed around 3000 enemies with a loss of only around 200 soldiers is just satisfying.

Winning/Losing a battle will affect your image. With image points, you can afford additional troops, money, weapons or generals. But the downside is, that buying those things will lower your image points. And bigger image means better morale for the whole army.

Won battles also have effect on some of the upcoming battles (e.g. 5% less troops for the enemy).

The battles itself are really interesting - and even if you replay the same mission again or a savegame, the battle may lead to a complete different direction.

There are often 2 or 3 small battles before a big one. They're good to improve your troops as long as you do good. It doesn't help your campaign if you win a small battle at all costs when you lose maybe 5000 soldiers but you'll only get 3500 for the victory.

Most important thing in battles are cover, flanking the enemy as well as having better weapons. Having a 1 on 1 straight fight on open landscape infantry vs infantry isn't very good because it will result in big loss on both sides. And with some missions, goals for winning the battle might not just be to hold a hill, but also to e.g. make 10% more damage than the enemy or to not lose more than 50% of your army.

While the small battles may take around 30-45 minutes, the bigger battles often have more stages or days and take a longer.

Personally I really like the graphics as long as you don't zoom in too much. For a closer zoom, the solders could need a higher LOD. However, it's not needed to zoom in at all.

I've certainly played alot of mods, custom scenarios, and other stuff along those lines, but not a game specifically focused on it...

UG:CW is, obviously, focused on that conflict. You get to either fight individual battles or partake in a quite lengthy campaign as you build/maintain your army and fight numerous battles over the course of the war. To me, this game kinda feels like a Total War game, but lacking the high end graphics, animations, and other technical aspects. Other differences being that there is no terrible diplomacy system, the battles you fight are already set and have specific conditions/goals, and your only real concern is winning battles. I actually like this approach because while the ""sandbox history"" of games like the Total War series or Paradox Games' (Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, etc) can be very fun, sometimes... a game that trades that freedom for attention to detail is pretty cool too.

In that regard, my history nerd-side got quite a bit out of this game and gave me some insider knowledge that certainly helped while playing the game. I have this massive ""atlas book"" focused on the ACW and the maps in there match what I saw in this game, as did the generals involved and the overall course of battles. It is heavily scripted, but there is room for differences should you manage to succeed where history failed. That can be very rewarding, with it often meaning you can win battles before enemies are heavily reinforced. Other knowledge, such as how the minie ball (aka, rifle bullets) was the major killer of the war (after disease) or how artillery was very strong at close ranges but hadn't quite become super-lethal at longer ranges just yet, ended up being invaluable. Lastly, that the battles of the war gradually changed from resembling the Napoleonic era towards resembling WW1, and how that changes how you have to approach the game. In other words, this game is a treat for history nerds like me.

..Which may very well have made the difference between winning and losing, actually. This game can be pretty tough, and I was playing as the USA (the CSA would be harder, and by all accounts is). You often find yourself fighting battles with small forces awaiting reinforcement, forcing you to make do with what you have. These moments generally were the toughest parts of the game, since it often means you are outnumbered or racing against time to take an objective. The steamroller approach can work in bigger battles when you have all your forces, but much of the rest of the time you need skill to win. People complain about this, but I'm ok with it. After all, battles don't always happen when you want them to.

Less good is the ""prestige"" system in the campaign. Basically, you earn prestige from winning battles, can spend it in order to get more money, weapons, etc, lose some from draws, and lose alot from losing battles. It is this last point that is the real issue, because those prestige losses can be huge, and if you lose more than you have it is game over. So you can't really afford to lose battles. I didn't have this problem since I was playing as the Union and my approach to strategy games is to stack the deck in my favor before ever reaching the battlefield. But I am worried about it when I try to play as the CSA instead, since the real ACW (and the game) was very much a case of the USA tapping into their huge resources while the CSA had to fight with what it could scrape together.

One more point to raise about the campaign is that battles and the overall campaign is influenced by your performance. Specifically, enemy armies continually increase in strength as the war continues, but you can mess this up if you keep inflicting huge costly defeats upon them. I though that this was a pretty cool way to let the player ""alter"" history to a degree, but it ended up being a little disappointing too. Because if you repeatedly crush the enemy, or inflict massive losses in the early stages of a battle they will have much less later on. 

This was highlighted for me strongest in the Battle of Gettysburg. The first day was an intense defensive battle that had me have to fight hard to not get overrun by the CSA. But because I inflicted such heavy casualties first during Day 1 and then during the Day 2 assault on Little Round Top, the CSA attack on Culp's hill didn't really happen and the infamous Pickett's Charge on Day 3 was so feeble I ended up charging them instead. The game continued to be challenging and interesting throughout, but repeated early success probably ended up ensuring that later battles like Gettysburg and Cold Harbor ended up being much easier than they ought to have been because the enemy had little to fight with. With that said, the later battles like Cold Harbor when it became a proto-WW1 ended up being the most costly battles I fought.

Anyway, that's enough for this review I think. As usual, I'm only stopping now because if I don't I could keep going on and on. I don't want to write that much and chances are you don't want to read it. XD

Is this game fun? Reasonably. Does it immerse you into the ACW while balancing historical accuracy with freedom to change results? Absolutely. Would I recommend it to others? Yes, but with the added point that knowledge of the war helps and a lack of it likely makes it harder. So if you are a history nerd who has even a passing interest in the American Civil War, consider checking this out. It was pretty neat, more than worth the money I paid, and there is still plenty of content left for me to do.

The good:

-Looks nice.
-Feels like a great game, especially during the first 5 hours.
-Army customization, upgrades and different weaponry are nice touches.

The bad:

-The AI is broken in various ways. For instance, it often charges irrationally, and seemingly to make up for this the developers gave it some super powers.
-Cavalry is useless, even against lone skirmishers or undefended artillery units. You are always better off investing the money and manpower in an infantry unit.
-Battles are heavily scripted, to the point of having a broken logic. You are supposed to defend a position. You do it and thanks to the AI's suicidal charges, the enemy gets almost completely wiped out or routed. Then the game hits a point in the script and you are prompted ""Our position is being overwhelmed! We must fall back to that place!"" Then the script magically teleports your whole army to the hill behind the position where you were doing just fine. Then you watch the comedy of the enemy trying to charge your new position with 10% of its starting force because you had killed or routed the rest before your position was ""overwhelmed.""

The ugly:

-No matter how badly you beat the AI, it keeps making up its losses and more. This renders your actions completely inconsequential. After 50 or so hours, (or sooner if you are smarter than I am) you realize that you are not playing a strategy simulator. You are instead playing one of those clicker flash games in which the numbers keep increasing as you upgrade your skills but nothing else changes because as your income increases so do the cost of future upgrades. 

If that sounds too abstract, here is the same point made in concrete gameplay terms: I first played two campaigns with CSA. The first time when enemy kept making up their losses regardless, I thought ""Well, I am a noob. So, I didn't beat them hard enough in the beginning. That's why they recovered."" But then I played the same campaign again. Even in the easiest difficulty and right after I consistently mowed down 70% of the Union army battle after battle, the next battle they always had 10k more soldiers than they did before. Then, I said ""Well, they are the Union after all. They had a larger population than the rebels"" and I tried out the Union campaign. Who knew the South could replace 200k+ losses and keep pressing towards the DC? I didn't. They kept coming, their numbers kept swelling no matter how many I killed.

The Verdict:

I wanted to like this game. And to be honest, I enjoyed it for many hours. But the enjoyment was in part due to the illusion created by the game, the illusion that my actions and decisions mattered. Once the illusion was shattered by the realization that no matter how well I play, the AI will be able to match and raise my hand, the enjoyment was replaced with disappointment and frustration. Overall, I would have to say, the experience ended up being negative.

PS: I aslo want to respond to a common objection to negative reviews with many hours: ""You played it for 70 hours, how bad can it be? Grow up and get a life!""

It is possible to enjoy something in the short term although the enjoyment is replaced by discomfort after a while.

However, I feel the game was rushed into production with the premise.... this is good enough.....

More specifically, the game lacks polish and flexability. 

For instance, the campaign game follows the course of the actual battles during the war, but the army management, where you actually build your army, seems to be designed for PvP play rather then any historical immersion.

The major personalities of the war are present, but they lack, personality...good or bad, commanders are just presented for their historical context, their abilities or limitations in real life not withstanding.

You have the ability to outfit your army and customize their arms, but it seems most of the available muskets,  rifles and cannons are just meant for eye candy, as they never appear in the numbers required to outfit a unit.

Winning or loosing a battle does not seem to affect the course of the game, you are stuck in the same battles as the historical counterparts, no matter how you performed in previous battles. There is also no strategic benefit or consequence for winning a battle, apart from a possible buff for the next battle.
 
And all of the battles devolve into ""capture the flag"" , where everything revolves around capturing a key terrain feature, rather then focusing on the enemy army. In fact, once the terrain requirements are met, its best to husband your units and ignore the enemy until time runs out.

The custom games are very limited, as you are forced to use one of the premade battle maps and then pay for a limited supply of arms and men. 

The pre-made historical battles are very playable and enjoyable, but from these you can also see how the army management system does not do the game justice.

Overall, Ultimate General seems to have potential, but given its built in limitations becomes rather repetative and dull once you've gone through it a couple of times.",1511925436,1511971317,False,6,0,0.568718075752258301,0,True,False,False

Although the developers advertise that they fixed/improved it, I have screenshots for each battle and experimented with numbers, and it turns out that you still have to think a lot in camp whether to improve your numbers, unit size or equipment, because every improvement might be mirrored by the AI twicefold. For example I noticed that before achieving a crushing victory at Port Republic, the AI armory was 21-26%, after it was 39-44%, that is after I killed more than half their force. So basically the reward for crushing the AI was that I play a harder battle at Gaines' Mill, I am better if I skip the battle. I don't want to spend time calculating the scaling instead of actually enjoying the game, but this degree of brokenness makes me to (or makes me stop playing). And I will mention here that actually this is a pretty good game, except for this (horrendous) downside.

I am a developer myself and I know that at some point you have to draw a line on a product, say that it is what it is and move forward.

In a nutshell - a wargame where you move around units composed of individuals, not square cardboard pieces with numbers on them, and watch them duke it out.  The game is executed well -- it's beautiful to look at, it's relatively easy to understand the controls, and it provides a lot of replay value.  

It's not perfect, mind you.  There are some tactical quirks to the AI, and occasionally some gunk gets in the works and you see tiny, almost-panicked units rout a complete and full-strength enemy unit (or something like that).  The terrain can sometimes be hard to read (there is an option to increase the depth of the terrain on the map; I find that essential, but still occasionally have issues), which is a factor in a game that attempts to realistically model the benefits/costs of fighting uphill vs. downhill.  The campaign model in this one (which is greatly expanded and modified from the relatively basic sequential battle system in Gettysburg) can be a bit complex and challenging.  And the game does not hold your hand at all -- you really do need to know at least some basic military tactics and concepts to function well in the game.  

On the whole, though, it's an excellent wargame, albeit not something with copious depth (like, say, anything by Gary Grigsby).  Great for people of intermediate wargame skill (like me), but I'd think that hardcore grognards may find it too easy or simplistic (or both).  Given that it's a very small development team (who have proven to be quite good at responding to user feedback on both their games), it's an impressive achievement.

I'll address the elephant in room first. The graphics look like that from a game from 10 years ago. If you're looking for a game that shows the sweat on the brow of the soldier you this isn't your game. That being said it has to be one of the most comprehensive tactical strategy games I've ever played, taking into acount the reload time of your soldiers, their morale, their condition, the weapons stats, the cover that they are in, etc. The coolest part is there are several differant modifiers available to help you improve these stats through unit veterancy, allocating weapons, assigning commanders, etc. which helps this game stand out from Empire Total War. Customizing your army is one of the best parts of this game. It's a constant balancing act of acuring the best weapons for the cheapest cost for the most soldiers. This balancing is depedent purely on ones gameplay within the campaign. Though even losing battles there are so many ways to play around lack of equipment, lack of man power, or lack of money by tailoring your army to work around it. So though you may lose here and there, the game may punish but it's never unfair with what you can or can't do. The tools to beat the odds are always there. So 36 hrs in, I can say I love this game in every aspect; the accuracy, the gameplay, and the balancing of the game.

The graphics are well done. The AI is fairly good, and challenging.  The options you have in each battle are wide open with the exception of holding victory locations and the dreaded battle timer - however, you can customize your Corps units, weapons, generals, and recruitment. You can also determine where you spend your ""capital"" points. 

Commanding units and giving orders is relatively easy, the interface is quite user-friendly, and overall - I loved playing this game through and seeing how my different Corps excelled, grew, shrank with losses, and how the weapons developed over the course of the war. The challenges on each side are quite different, I played through both from the time this was a limited release.

The Union - you have the disadvantage of mostly being on the offensive and digging out well-entrenched Rebel forces. You also have to procure your weapons, because the ones you might pick up from the battlefield from the Rebels are horribly outdated and not useful. You will be hard pressed to build a big enough Corps, and equip them, to overcome your casualties and beat the Rebels. Your advantages are plenty of recruits, access to advanced weaponry (if you can afford it), and being on the offensive always gives you the initiative to strike the enemy at their weakest points and control the momentum of the battle.

The Confederacy - you have the disadvantage of numbers, you are always outnumbered. Your weapons are heinously outdated, and you don't have access to the Union's advancement in weaponry so you are forced to find ways to capture Union supplies and weapons. Also, you are often times forced to defend positions based on victory locations and it's not always ideal. However, if you can find ways to make sure you have mobile reserves, cover your flanks as necessary, invest in short-range artillery to decimate Union ranks, and run down retreating Union Forces to capture their supplies, your defenses can become impenetrable.

Overall - 8/10.  I've been in the military for over 20 years, have re-enacted Civil War battles, and have been playing war games both electronic and board for nearly 30 years.

The game itself is quite easy to learn, but mastering it, that is a long journey. 
The game doesn't end if your army looses a battle, but getting back into the next fight might be a lot harder if you've lost too many men and all that's left of your army are half strength regiments full of green recruits.

I've had many hours of fun with this title, finding it to be a unique and innovative approach to the RTS genre.

The game's campaign takes you chronologically through the major battles of the civil war with a persistent army for you to command during and manage between battles. Having an army that you need to manage and carry from one battle to the next adds a great degree of importance to your tactical choices. Each battle has win/loss/draw victory conditions and rewards and this is one of the few games where it may be beneficial to skip (if a minor battle) or fight for a draw or loss if you think pushing for the victory will cost you too many men. I would recommend saving frequently and maintaining several save files so that you don't have to start completely over if you take horrific losses in a battle and find that you just can't recover two or three major battles down the road.

The gameplay itself is quite fun, with a unique way to control your unit's movements and with a focus on locating and occupying advantageous terrain, flanking, and unit morale.

I love the concept and framework that the Ultimate General Series has built and Civil War is an impressive sequel to Gettysburg... that being said, I hope the next installment ( which I will purchase regardless ) offers much more polish in the end product. 

Pros 
- Ability to create and custom equip army
- Unique art style
- Great sound
- Multi-stage battles

Cons
- Terrain glitches causing units to get ""stuck"" ( i.e. water crossings )
- Enemy units practically ""flying"" across great distances
- Enemy cav sometimes glitches through your lines with no collision at all
- Enemy units route through your lines and reform on your flanks
- Units in melee can be fired upon by nearby units with almost 0 fratricides
- Poor continuity in some of the multi-stage battles ( i.e. Unit dispositions )
- Enemy units seem to have 0 condition/morale modifiers ( allowing them to sprint/reform continuously )
- Routed enemies tend to build up on edges of map rather than fleeing the field
- AI makes outright silly decisions ... ( Too Many )

The battles are pretty well done, and it is not an easy game to master. It takes some time to learn the tricks. 

The only downside I'd mention to it is opposed to the last game they made, Ultimate General: Gettysburg. In UG: Gettysburg, each battle would operate in phases and players would have choices about how to deploy during the next phase. For example, on the 1st day of Gettysburg, Union players could choose to pull back to Cemetary Ridge or to try to hold the Confederates at Oak Hill. Confederates could choose whether to do a frontal assault or attack from two sides.

Scenarions are split between prmarioy offensive or defensive. 

When defensive, you station yourself in buildings/behind barracades/in bushes and wait for the AI to come at you. Head first. . if you are dislodged, a quick swap in of another backup unit menas keeping the position. The vastly superior numbers of AI in many scenarios means they institgate charge afer charge. Easy to hold afer just a couple of plays.

When offensive, the main crucial diffefence is that once the AI is dislodged, it will not immediately replace its positon, meaning you can comfortably take on postions that the AI has no chance of moving you from. Attacking AI units from slightly differnt directions (eg 10 o clock 12 oclock, 2 oclock)  will also give you the uper hand, as AI iwll not respond quick enough.

So in defending, its just a question of manning the defensive points, and selcting the charging units for your artillery to target (dull)

In attacking, avoiding open ground , using the topography (moving form building to buildiing, bush to bush etc) and approaching units or defended points from slighltly differnt angles, and hey presto, you have the advantage (no challenge)

If they sharpen up the AI- and they did with Gettusberg making it more and more playable - then it could be woth a look (tho the general lack of 2 way action in most scenarios woudl stil limit enjoyment).

This is a great game, in theory at least. I liked Ultimate General Gettysburg, but I love Ultimate General: Civil War. The only problem is, the difficulty is insanely difficult. I have probably around 2000 hours in strategy games give or take. I am by no means a newbie and by no means a master, so I decided to play normal difficulty on the campain. The mechanics of this game are beautiful and I can not wait for them to be put to good use. The real issue with this campaign, is that the enemy is constantly outnumbering you. I have played 8 battles so far and I've been outnumbered by 1.5 times or more every time. If I have 10,000, the enemy is garunteed to have at least 15,000 without a doubt. I find myself barely clinging on for dear life needing to restart frequently and change out units to appease the deployment gods and get the enemy unit deployment numbers a little lower. Normal difficulty is too hard for me, well just play easy you say? My friend who has hundreds of hours in Gettysburg and thousands in strategy games also cannot play normal difficulty in this game and I rarely see him lose in any strategy game. Regardless, we tried easy difficulty and it's so easy that it's no longer fun. I feel like fixing this problem is a minor easy fix for a very large problem. It's my only problem with the game, but it's big enough that it entirely ruins this great game. When this is fixed I would love to recommend the game and talk about it's great mechanics and enjoyability, but for now I can not enjoy this game.

Edit: I think the reason they've got it set this way is because of how stupid the AI is. It's not overly stupid, but it can't play tactically and so they just try to overwhelmingly outnumber you. If you increase the amount of troops you're bring in a battle the AI does too.

The battles: fun, easy to get into, difficult to master.  Best interface/userinteractions in a game like this by a wide margin, ever.  The AI isn't great (I'm a big proponent of human opponents), but it's still really fun because...

The armies: Rather than moving units around a campaign map you choose from battles from different years of the campaign.  The army management system has more in common with xcom than it does total war.  At times it can feel a little tedious (I felt the same way about managing 20+ xcom soldiers) but it also adds a lot of depth to the game.   Want to win at Gettysburg as the Confederates.  Be prepared to spend many many lives and still not make your objectives.  30,000 men died fighting me to a draw on normal mode and those lives were simply not replaceable.   You're left locked in the same proposition that the North and South found themselves in during the war - the South needing decisive, efficient victories and the north needing a bloodbath. 

Campaign evolution: Over the course of the campaign new guns come into use, earthworks and trenches proliferate, and the size of your army grows vastly.   The new guns drastically increase the killing power of each brigade, especially defenders, and pose interesting problems and opportunities for each side.  In the first battles you're handling maybe 4-6 brigades and in the final years of the campaign you could have something like 150.  You may need to set aside an afternoon for some of the battles: your left-side flanking maneuver might be made up of 25 units (maybe as many as 40 if you've sent out all your skirmishers).

Although some fun improvements have been made, they ultimately don’t make that game worth the time.

The Good
The new army camp screen where the player can build their army is an excellent addition.  Recruiting and leveling new brigades and officers, outfitting them with better weapons, and spending reputation points for more money or better weapons gives the player a real sense of achievement as they progress through the campaign.  Sadly this is the only positive for this game.

The Bad
1:  The balance in this game in non-existent.  2000 men infantry brigades routing to 150 men skirmisher brigades and melee cavalry brigades with 3x the men being unable to rout or even push back lone artillery brigades to name a few examples.  Yes I know I about being flanked, that is not the issue.  The balance is also incredibly inconsistent for player vs the AI.  When the player is on defense with superior cover that AI brigades seem to have a much easier time dislodging and routing them player does in the opposite situation.

2:  Since the battles are recreations of actual events it makes them very scripted which is to be expected, but that takes away a lot of the potential strategy a player could employee to achieve a better victory with less loss of men.  Combine this with a battle that has the player attacking a defending AI and the player is guaranteed to take more losses in men and equipment then with be rewarded for winning the battle.  On several occasions I tried to flank the enemy lines only to have the enemy receive reinforcements from behind me making the flanking maneuver pointless.

3:  Any battle that is more attacking of a defending AI will always result in a net loss for the player-ALWAYS.  Try to be smart and flank the enemy, nope doesn’t work.  Try to do something other than continuously throw brigades against a defending entrenched AI, not gonna work/would take too long for the time provided.  Even if you manage to win a Victory in the battle it will cost you more money to rebuild your army than what is gifted to you for the Victory.

I want to like this game but there are many issues and inconsistencies that make it more aggravating than its worth.  If you can buy it on sale for less than 5 bucks I’d say go for it, but otherwise don’t waste your money.",1509305287,1509305287,False,44,2,0.657319009304046631,0,True,False,False

Every battle feels engaging and some of the best AI I've ever seen in a war game.

It made me want to learn more deeply about the tactics of each battle being fought rather than just the grand strategic narratives every ACW buff knows.

That said... I hope there are more updates to the game.

There is a heavy bias to the selection of battles to the Eastern Theater, the one everyone cares about. Outside of that theater you have a grand total of three battles: Shiloh, Stones River, and Chickamauga. I get that one problem is how heavily involved engineering and naval support was in the Western theater, particularly any battle on the Mississippi River, whereas this is a pretty typical napoleonic infantry-cavalry-artillery game, but that's kind of the point, isn't it?

Even aside from that, there are many important battles in the Western Theater which could probably be accomodated in this game: Vicksburg (post-Grant's landing), Chattanooga, Perryville, Franklin, Nashville, and/or the Battle of Atlanta.

This is also kind of part of a mild pro-Confederate (or at least pro-Virginia) bias in terms of the battles chosen. All of the battles I named above were Union victories, since outside of perhaps Chickamauga the Union consistently won major battles and offensives in the West.

I get it, I'm from Virginia, I love all the Eastern theater battles, but even then most of the battles chosen are from the first two years of the war, and there's only a few that take place after Gettysburg.

The only battles between Lee and Grant are Cold Harbor and Richmond? The Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, North Anna, the siege of Petersburg? Nope.

I get that you don't want to have too many Union victories (although as I said you're slightly short now), but from a tactical or even strategic perpective most of the battles of the Overland Campaign were either Confederate victories or inconclusive - not until Petersburg did Lee ultimately break.

So bottom line, the game is absolutely fantastic, but seeing as the devs are so amazing at providing updates, I'd love for the broader story of the war to be covered, rather than just the popular history version which ignores everything west of the Appalachians and anything after Gettysburg.",1508643415,1508643415,True,9,0,0.581444382667541504,0,True,False,False

It adds the critical element of continuity between battles (you keep your army), which for me, makes a campaign-style game much more engaging.  I usually don't care too much for real time games, but this one is manageable.  The balance between infantry/skirmishers, cavalry, and artillery seems about right and the battles are fun.  On top of all of this, it has caused me to study up on Civil War battles and learn some history.

From a gaming standpoint, the one thing I would like to see is an ahistorical option that reflects pathways in the War that may have occurred particularly when the outcome of a major battle is substantially different that what happened historically.  I also don't fully understand the scaling mechanic of the game.  It might be nice to have a bit more transparancy on this or even better an option to adjust the magnitude of the scaling.

Even after 259 hours (at this time), I'm still improving my technique, and in fact, will be starting a new Confederate Campaign (on normal) because I just lost the last one at the final battle (Washington) basically because I didn't have enough troops in one of my Corps.   

All-in-all, I applaud the designers and hope there is more of this style of game down the road.....perhaps a fantasy setting that allows for more flexibility in battle sequence and overall goals.

Edit - I have played the full version now, the game is even better.  Seriously this is one of the best games I have played in a very long time.  The way your army can be devistated in one battle and slowly have to get rebuilt to overcome the momentum of the opponent in subsequent battles is just awesome.  I don't know if there is a better civil war game out there.  If you are on the fence, just buy the game.  The campaign is long, makes sense, is varied in scenarios.  Everything about this game just is solid and fun.  

Pros
- Many battles to fight in 
- your armies carry over to some degree
- there are multi day large battles
- there are small skirmishes
- the pace is great

Cons
- I want to zoom way in and you are stuck at a large distance
- sometimes it is frustrating to be overwhelmed with numbers

A great focus on strategy where terrain, equipment and morale all play a crucial part.
A large amount of historical battles to choose from allowing you to really feel like you are part of the campaign.
Decent AI that moves to counter you and often takes you by suprise.
Glorious graphics.
A competant learning curve throughout the game.
Historical figures that you can recruit to lead your men.
Lovely music and sound quality during combat (if a little repetative at times).
Honest to goodness had me at the edge of my seat focusing hard at the higher game levels to win battles.
SO MUCH MORE! SOOOOO MUCH!


Cons;

AI scaling is a bit wonky, you often end up being heavily outnumbered leaving some battles impossible to win if you try and increase the size of your army.
Routing AI often flee through your troops when you really can't afford to chase them and they end up coming back in perfect flanking positions. 
Veteran costs are a bit extreme considering battle rewards (even with maxed out politics, economy and training perks).
Leaves you wanting more skirmish battles and minor engagements.
Flanking seems a little random at times, i.e flanking an enemy often does very little compared to what it does to you.
Cavalry vs routing inf brigades needs a buff.
Cavalry AI is often a little unresponsive.


Improvements needed in the future;

Ability to have a multiplayer feature for historical + custom battles would be AMAZING!
Mod capability to customise unit appearance.
A fix for the AI rout system so routing units actively try to get back to the rest of the army rather than going literally anywhere they please and often getting lost and decimated behind enemy lines as a result.
Artillery buffs at long range (round shot) so it actually can damage bunched up units a decent amount rather than killing not even a handful of men per volley even with a direct hit.
An ability to rally wavering/routing men more quickly would be appreciated.
A fix to the AI scaling so you don't have to worry about being vastly outnumbered in every battle once you increase your army organisation.

As the Union got as far as Gettysburg although a bit confused as to how I lost Culps Hill scenario as it was still in my hands when I was sacked!

Tactically - rush into winning and you will have heavy casualties which you then need to replace...costing money which means less money to build new corps.... Strategically fighting chronologically gives you the rewards ready for the big battle when you need your corps at strength. Balance rookies to vets at around 3:1 to gain them experiece without breaking in combat. Surprising how quick they become steady soldiers. Finally worked out how to use artillery effectively (give 'em 10lb Parrots and Napoleons at 12 guns per brigade asap for effectiveness and keep 'em away from the enemy!)

As a student of history, and an avid reader of all things WW2, Civil War, Napoleon, Rome, and others I find this game to have an impressive level of historical research, from the weapons, to the names of the various leaders and generals involved. 

Gameplay is designed to keep you thinking, where the same battle played again may have different results if you attack the left flank,  the AI opponents will react accordingly. 

I personally think that this game shines a light on a often overlooked genre of gaming, It harkens back to the days of ""CWG 2"" in the early 90's. I give it 5 stars.

If I could ask for more, the only thing I would like is more 'between battle' things to do, such as in ""AGEODS American Civil War' allowing you to do various things with your funding. 

Of course naval action would be nice... and so would a longer campaign or eastern / western campaign. perhaps your main army is busy fighting 2nd Bull Run while another army is off in the Tennessee area on a different campaign.

I do wish the battles allowed for more player strategy as the campaign battles are scripted to be historically accurate and you can find that your strategy needs to be completely readjusted when the game moves to the next phase of the battle.

Building divisions and brigades, arming them with quintesential weapons of the era, and assigning leadership is engaging and interesting. Getting into a nasty exchange of musketry and cannon fire is a gleeful pleasure to watch and winning said fights is rewarding. But where things begin to fall apart for me is when the game starts to get bigger. 


When I say bigger, I mean that in terms of the size of your army. Very rapidly, you will find yourself on titanically big maps, attempting to control dozens of units in an army that must be well over 70,000 men strong. You will also be forced to control that army in 1500-3000 man clumps, and organize them in a manner which will allow you to carry the day in battle. This is not easy. 

This game is, quite frankly, not meant for people like me who simply do not have the headspace to manage such a colossal endeavor.


The game really shines when you are on the defensive. The nature of commanding such a vast array of troops lends itself to defensive fighting in almost every way. Reaction times are not as readily punished on the defensive, and understanding where the enemy will likely move towards and planning ahead for that assault is incredibly rewarding. Going on offensives, however, is a different animal entirely. 


I truly believe that this game would beneift hugely from the inclusion of a cooperative game mode, wherein a friend could be given command of parts of your army. Being able to split the effort of commanding massive armies over multiple people (just like command structures in real life) would, in my very humble opinion, make this game one of the top 3 in my library today if not the very best.

PRO:
- Very detailed, lot of historic accuracy such as locations, battle phases, generals, weapons etc.
- Game looks beautiful, sounds beautiful and it has an overall very good polish
- Campaign is pure epicness, assigning generals, forming divions, equiping brigades and what not. Just epic
- Combat is very satisfying, morale, cover, veterancy is superbly designed compared to a piece of shit Total War series has. Routing is a thing, divisions (units) after a recovery come back for another fight etc
- AI is one of the best I've seen in an RTS in ages compared to for example Total War series which is utter shit, reaaaaally thumbs up for this ! Yo
- Historical battles and custom battles with different angles. Also amazing
- Higher difficulites can punish you because you just can't up with the strength the enemy brings, still great challenge and great experience unlike Total War Series where difficulity increase just makes the AI insanely rich and enables them to stack armies within 2-3 turns
- No DLC junk thanks God

*I've spent a few hours and sheets of notebook paper drafting my perfect army compositions inbetween battle. This amount of time is not typical or required inbetween battles (spreadsheets are fun and dont let anyone tell you otherwise). 

P.S, Needs Mod/Workshop support for the game to last through the ages, however as i understand that wont be coming due to limitations with the game engine (citation needed). Dont quote me on this.

P.P.S Some people are upset there is no multiplayer, I'm not, i dont have friends. Problem solved.

P.P.P.S My BIGGEST gripe so far. I cannot find up to date detailed information on various things/mechanics in the game. Guides almost all outdated. Renedering them little more use than virtual paperweights. I desperately want to min max this game, but some aspects are either hidden within the game engine, or changed too much from when the game first released, to be accurate.

I played it, but I felt like I barely knew anything about how to control the troops or why this game was great. Seriously, it would take at least ten hours of gameplay for me to familiarize myself with things. 

Apparantly there is no way to fight a small battle. I thought it would be pretty obvious that some people would want to play a few games on a small scale but the devs feel differently. To me the big battles mean that things are always hectic and sometimes I like to relax. I never feel like I can zoom in or out enough. There isn't a way to record battles. I like to watch the action sometimes, but I think that would probably be dissappointing anyway since there isn't much eye candy like watching troops getting thrown around by cannon shells and things like that. I hated the fort battle. 

Seems like most of their effort went into realism, realism of terrain and the challenges the generals faced. That's admirable but I don't see where that's translating into fun. It seems to be a game for hardcore history types more than it is a gamer's game. I think if I keep the game I'll play it for another five hours out of guilt and then I'll avoid it like so many other games. I'm just not feeling that old ""I can't wait to play"" feeling. 

How does the game make me feel? I feel like its all over for me and gaming. Its like game companies don't know how to make a game that appeals to me anymore. Are they making games for a new generation that is a totally different type of human being. I think that may be possible. Depressing. Have so many gamers of my generation passed on that our tastes are not worth caring about? Could be. Even worse, game companies don't feel like they have to make a great game that has mass appeal.

1) Do I always have to fill up the name everytime I play? From the settings or profile, I should be able to set it. 


2) Please have an option to remove the ""Mission Time"" or have an option to extend it. When using the regular speed, the mission time is just enough, but the game takes too much time and the soldiers move too slow at the regular speed so I use the 2x or 3x speed. At this rate, the game ends so fast. 


3) Please also have game modes like ""FIGHT to DEATH"". I just want to play and really does not care about the objectives. The game just suddenly finishes and will not let me continue to destroy the remaining enemy army. 


4) The Army, Barracks, Shop are terribly confusing to use. I would like to try the other weapons in the shop but the available items does not meet the number required. Please enable users to try unlimited soldiers, weapons etc. We are playing games to have fun (at least in the Custom battles). 


5) There are too many steps before being able to dive into the game itself. Please figure out to reduce it at least. Or maybe have just one screen to set it all up. And of course remember the previous settings.

I have been wanting a game like this for years. I have been playing the campaign mode on Medium difficulty as I learn more and more about the game. One thing is certain, the decisions you make during gameplay will affect the battles to come. My only concern was with Antietam. I wasted hours upon hours using many different tactics, even starting over the Campaign from scratch to find the AI continued to overpower my  CSA. I tried tactics that others have posted from videos on Youtube and articles and could never even come out the battle with a Draw. Not sure about that battle. I know the history of the outcome, but for all those who are playing as a CSA  General and have defeated it, hats off and a big salute. I expect it to be a very hard battle but on medium difficulty with no perks, I just cannot get past it without  routing my army early as possible to continue to have an army.

This game, however, I wholeheartedly endorse. 

I own its predecessor (Ultimate General Gettysburg) which, while an enjoyable game, had various shortcomings and a lack of replayability, all of which have been more than addressed in Civil War. There's dozens of different ways to approach the Campaign promising years of enjoyment. Supply lines, skirmishers, cavalry that can dismount - these have been added without increasing the need for micromanaging & turning battles into a chore. Line of sight is easier to understand than the previous game, making artillery much more effective - and it clearly shows when units are blocked, flanked, or simply need a rest from battle.

And then there's the whole economy side of things, with money and reputation earned from success in battle and allowing you to grow & equip the army under your command. In many games this kind of thing can be a confusing chore, but in Civil War its a delight.

It's not quite the deep, complex, free-form Civil War game that I've been hoping to see from Creative Assembly's Total War series, but I can't really expect it to be. Overall, I recommend the game! It doesn't have the polish of a bigger-budget title, but what it does do well, it does really well, and it provides some deep and compelling strategy gaming.

Those of you who do try it out will find a game that does have some genuine innovations. Strategy game developers like Creative Assembly should definitely look closely at Ultimate General's unit movement commands. Drawing movement paths and including a ""fall back"" command are things that should probably become standard in real-time strategy games -- especially those with historical or realistic settings.

For oldshool couunter chip boardgamers it´s a must!

The core mechanics are easy to understand which puts 
you in a place to find your playstyle quickly.

In the campaign mode you´re thrown into battle in an instant.
And you will get a strong reaffirmation of right and wrong 
choices, so be prepared to reload/restart a battle :)

Inbetween battles you´ll find yourself tinkering with your corps.
Should you increase the size of your bad ass brigades, or should 
you rather found new ones for more tactical options.

Should you get a harassing cavalry brigade, or will their
objective be to counter enemy cannons?
Will your skirmishers be cannonfodder to slow down an
enemy attack, or do you want them to be elite snipers?
-The equipped weapons will give you these options. 
Only money and manpower will limit your decisions,
so choose wisely ;)

A reckless playstyle is seldom rewarded, since your
brigades morale crumbles eventually until they will
run, get captured or in worst case fall apart. With 
your commanders eventually getting killed which
will be a bad thing because their talent in leadership
(represented in unit skills) will be lost. And it´s damn
expensive to build them up to former strength.

So the real game is to manage your units characteristics
on the battlefield and trying to build them further
inbetween.

There are three levels of difficulty, and while that may seem like not a huge deal, it really is.  

The easiest level allows those who like the quick action of moving pieces around the battle field and diving into battle; Quick action, fun action that requires some decision making on your part, without having to really dive into the micro-management aspect that might otherwise turn them off.  

The mid-range difficulty setting will require considerably more attention to detail regarding preparation and in-battle management.  Lots more of hitting the pause button during battle to make sure your units are positioned properly.  Once one of your units gets routed things can snowball quickly, so I find that hitting the pause button frequently, especially for larger battles, is a great benefit.  The downside, especially for those who favor point, click and let 'em fight style of play, is that it can get a little tedious to constantly pause the game.  I enjoy it, as it really lets you put your tactical skills to the test. But I can see how the frequent pausing can annoy some (or if they don't make adjustments, how they'll get frustrated with the AI's very competent moves).

The most challenging level leaves you with less money and manpower, plus the AI is quite challenging.  You really need to make smart decisions in camp, where you decide on the weapons to supply your army, and again, on the battlefield you'll need to really, really pay attention to how the battle is playing out.  Right now I've got my hands full on the regular difficulty level. Those who master this level have my full respect.

This is so much more than just a series of battles though.  As I touched on above, you'll have the option to choose the weapons (at a cost) to supply your infantry, cav, arty, and skirmishers.  And as you earn career points for victories you can use those points to improve things like politics, economy, medicine, etc.  Bottom line, you've got lots of options and how you prepare for upcoming battles does have a large impact on how those battles play out.

I do wish that things were not quite so ""scripted"" as some others have mentioned.  It would be nice if there was a way to re-write history based on the outcome of the battles, or for us to split our armies up, and navigate in various directions(and have the AI have that same freedom, choosing where we want to attack next, or move to defend.  Also, the constant pausing on the more difficult settings in order to make sure your units are properly positioned may be a grind for some people, though I don't mind personally. Regardless, there is still a lot of replay value, as you learn, tweak your strategy and tactics, move up in difficulty level, or switch sides.

Overall, I find this to be an outstanding, and after a few weeks, still very addictive game.  Highly recommended.",1504621562,1504621562,True,3,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

However, I have a bit of a concern about some of the historical battles. They seem to be FAR too scripted based on historical events, leaving little room for real player strategy. For example, in the Stones River battle, as the Union, I managed to to the CSA left flank and ball up his army against the river by the end of the second scenario of the battle (which extends to first scenario). However, by the third scenario, the game basically tossed away all my gains, balled my army up on the road, and left me with CSA troops on three sides (presumably per the history of the battle). It basically made all my efforts futile. 

In a second, more recent example, during the Chancellorsville scenario, I managed to secure both the Plank Road objectives with the Union Army on the second scenario (the Stonewall Jackson flank attack scenario). But, like Stones River, by the third scenario my army was balled into a haphazard perimeter around that farmhouse per history and all my gains were lost. What made it particularly worse was that after I won the third scenario, I had to RETAKE all that ground I had already earned. 

What's the point of fighting these battles if the player is simply locked into script that decides the outcome regardless of how well I do? It's very frustrating. . . .",1504536096,1504536096,False,417,6,0.91527867317199707,35,True,False,False

Wouldnt be bad honestly, but it's kinda quirky if not buggy as of Jan 2016.  A significant percentage of the time I don't know why stuff is happening. Units not following orders leading to complete disasters. A tactic which worked too well on one map (unit in a building holding off 5x their number) are completely useless on the next map (getting rolled 1 on 1 in the same defensive situation). On a mission to capture 3 supply convoys, one would not register causing an automatic draw, insted of a win. My advice right now, is save your money; grab it in 6 months when it's either patched up or in a bargain bin.

UPDATE: returning to UGCV months later, I became quite addicted to it. I've had  lots of fun playing it, enough so to change my recommendation.  Learning the game is easy (get in cover, always flank, between battles improve troop quantity and quality) but the subtler aspects of tactics are challenging, esp on hard (baiting the enemy, forcing him to fight out of cover, distracting units, cavalry raiding in the rear). 

That being said the game is still quirky: units doing bizarre things because they lose LOS to their target, entrenchments being often useless. rare weapons being rather ineffective. However, the quirks are minor and the game shines enough overall, to keep you coming back.",1484593247,1504131212,True,0,0,0.499758720397949219,0,True,False,False

The camp management is awesome and squad experience and perk gain is also well done. The AI is actually top-knotch.
Aout 25 missions per side i think.

The smaller ingagements are the most fun. Under 20/30 Brigades. The Interface is awesome and the unit control is also very well done. Not clunky at all, unlike some Total Wars.

The Cavalry speed is a bit slow. Knowing horses, a horse is at least twice as fast as a human in most rugged terrain and 3+ faster on open ground.

Some missions without a timer would also be welcome, especially when you are attacking. Realistic consequences of enemy reinforcement if you did not get them before X time or better placement the next day etc.

The game is not at all difficult to get into, especially if you start on easy but there are times that you need to keep a cool head and think about the bigger strategy and not merely the battles themselves. 

Basicaly, I WANT MORE !!

- other ideas for future installments, my 2 cents.

If this game could go a bit Geo-Political in it's scale I would jump for it. Like maybe a campaign directly after the Civil War, one where Britain and France ally to invade the colonies again? One where Spain declares war again and pushes from the south while the European mainlanders come in from the East with a theatre basically twice or three times as big as this one. The weaponry is not too advance and going on with a realistic timeline will complicate things with units and tactics and god-forbid full on trench warfare. So a alternate history for the same timeline should also keep things easier for the developers.  One where you are not as fixed as being fucked anyway as history dictates. Can still be linear, but maybe 3/5 routes/outcomes depending on your performance and dicisions.",1504033015,1504033015,True,15,0,0.679556429386138916,0,True,False,False

This game is exceptionly great. It is a great follow up to Gettysburg. The devs may be russian but they are very transparent with thier work, and they reach out to the community for feedback on new updates and what should be included in the future. Something that most game developers lack these days (And they update frequently). For the game itself there are few drawbacks but we will get back to that. But first the good things about this game.

It greatly protrays the civil war, what happens in the battles in game could've easily happend in real life. And if you know your history you can easily make what happens be some what historical. 

The ai is not perfect, but this is ai were talking about and for the company and the game I think the ai is beautiful. They dont make to to many odd choices. You can find the ai choosing to leave its cannon behind and retreating it's infantry but once again its ai.

The graphics are beautiful, it fits the game perfectly. It's not ""ultra realistic"" But it doesnt need to be, if it was I feel like the game wouldnt be as good as it is now. 

The mechanics are great, you can do a lot with your soldiers and sometimes if they are too tired or are scared they wont follow orders which is just amazing. The addative to supply makes you have to plan out your battles a lot more indepth as you need to get all your divisions and cannons supply. The ability to create your army is so fun and it makes you feel more attached to your soldiers and leaders, making you question if you should charge that unit with 16 cannons. 

There's a lot more than I will list here but now for the complaints.

The inabiliy to rotate the camera really bums me out but from what the devs say the way they textured the world it sounds like its not textured on the other side.

There are a few bugs still that can be a bit odd such as a unit deciding to have a seziure collectively.

The tutorial is just a bunch of reading, luckily ive played gettysburg so I knew what I was doing but for a new player an interactive tutorial would be quite handy.

The clock can be confusing as non of the speeds actually last one second.

AI can lure you to trap by sending few man as bait so it wants you to think ""oh, idioth has sent 800 infantry for flanking.. Im gonna crush them with my veterans who guarding flanks... (few minutes later...)  Damn where were those 2500 enemy veterans hiding ? Omg that motha fucka lured my veterans in a trap! (while your chasing veteran brigade losing it's 1/3 and become prey)

Many other AI tactics e.g. lures you to under a hill for a pincer movement and then charges from near forest and destroy your chasing infantries with guns which are hidden on top of the hill...

For sure AI will force you to many restarts...

- Cavalries need a rework.. They don't charge very well and they exhaust quickly which cause them to stop melee and fallback.. 170 skirmishers can handle 200 cavalries in a melee and cause them fallback which is very unrealistic, it doesnt matter how veteran skirmishers are... It just unrealistic..

-Developers should add friendly fire mind to units.. While infantries are fighting melee, u can support them from behind with fireteams which is very unrealistic.. They should add friendly fire logic to game... U can also support melee fights with artilleries which cause enemy to being butchered but not your own brigades....

I highlighted the most critical + and -...

Overall 75 / 100 - If they patch cavalry's battle capability and add friendly fire logic, i can give 95/100...

Everyone is used to the thing that you buy early access and then developers just become lazy as hell and work on a project for years, delivering strange updates.
Here we got different situation, at the start of early access we got really stable game with not so much maps, but the thing is that maps are so balanced and accurate, tested for so long, that I usually ended the current content and like next week or two received a new update.

This all started from ultimate general gettysburg, where developers tested lots of things, they actually prepared a base for Civil war. Ofc there were lots of tweaks and even, as i remember, new engine, but that was the first step and that was amazing.

Now, to the game. It is amazing. I was a fan of Total war series, but now it is difficult for me to play  it just because of its fast paced battles and I think only napoleon and shogun 2 are still great for me. Civil war sets high level of game design and AI. AI is just great. This is the game where you may spend 3 hours attempting one mission, and then yousee that you have to fully replay it because even if you won, you got so little troops left that you will be destroyed next battle. You have to think in that game, really really think. And I love this game for it. 

I almost finished game for confederace and union on middle difficulty and now trying to move on with union on maximum legendary difficulty and I have to say that AI is better, it is stronger and it is a real competition. 200+ hours is a game and it is stil great fun.

Dear Sarah,

The indications are very strong that we shall leave for work soon-- perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines on this masterful strategic simulator that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.

You may find the complexities of control, slow pace, and lack of text over hard-to-identify unit icons difficult. You may find the lack of a topographical mapmode severely difficult when placing artillery. I know how strongly you reacted to this game's predecessor, UG: Gettysburg. We owe a great a debt to that title that came before this one now. And I am willing—perfectly willing—to accept that this title suffers from the same limitations of Gettysburg—simplistic flanking mechanics, a steamrolling Union campaign—to help support this game, and to pay that debt.

But, my dear wife, when I know that you will experience the new depth that resource management, equipment management, and the political system brings, my own joys lay down nearly all of yours. You will encounter one of the most adapatable and intuititive AIs seen since the golden age of Close Combat games—even better than Gettysburg. You will enjoy the care and depth of each major battle—none repetitive, none ignored nor half-measured—and the pleasure of reading AI news dispatched begging for reinforcements against your victorious march. You will appreciate how the games resourcing forces you to choose between a retreat that preserves your army, or a last-stand to defend a capture point.

Sarah, my love for the maps and unit graphics is deathless, it seems to bind me to each battle with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield for I cannot bear to play the Confederates yet.

Forgive this game's few UI faults, and the many pains its drop-prone multiplayer have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish enemy brigades can sometimes be, standing still in open cover and taking 50-60% losses without retreat! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. To enjoy this game is to understand that while no perfect tactical simulation game exists, as far as the Civil War genre goes, Ultimate General: CiviI War is as close to one as exists on Steam.

Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for me, for we shall meet again. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.

 in huge 2 day battles your units are not where they were at end of day 1, you actually loose any gains and your units are all mixed up.

战斗部分：步兵线列阵时代战术的完美体现，小小的容量，一点不比全战逊色，麻雀虽小五脏俱全，2D画风也很细致，电脑的AI也蛮不错，如果你喜欢帝国全战或者拿破仑全战，那么战斗方面无需我多少，你一定会喜欢

战略部分：简直惊喜到爆！

你可以像一名真正的指挥官，配置麾下部队的兵种构成，安排军衔高的将领指挥，甚至给同一兵种但不同编制的部队配置不同的武器，可以一个子一个子的扣出钱来，集中武装一支装备精良的模范部队，也可以批量招募廉价的新兵，和敌人打人海战术

游戏看起来只有4个兵种，但是武器繁多，可以玩出很多花样，给某个部队装备不同的武器，打起来效果完全不同
步兵，有普通的前膛枪，有精度高的线膛枪，有快速发射的杠杆枪
炮兵，有威力大的榴弹炮，有精度高的步兵炮，有射程远的重炮
骑兵，有手枪加马刀的传统骑兵配置，也有只装备骑步枪的仿英国龙骑兵的配置
散兵，可以装备射程远的猎枪，甚至是配备光学瞄准镜的狙击步枪

我简直爱死这个兵种配置了，打赢了一场战役，政府发了薪水，拿着薪水去黑心的军火商那里买枪买炮，给孩子们装备。

游戏里还有 指挥官技能点 的设定，可以把技能点用在不同的方面来宏观支援你的战斗，比如每次战斗后增加金钱奖励等，顺便，这个游戏还有 缴获 的设定，每次战斗，都能够缴获敌人的武器，可以自己使用或者卖钱。",1502729281,1502729281,True,2,0,0.464216649532318115,0,True,False,False

This is sort of a minor issue but in the campaign you get to create a custom general as sort of an avatar, But you don't get to change his appearance so he just uses one of the random portraits.

There's a lot of weapon variety in the campaign, But with a lot of the weapons they never appear in large enough numbers to actually arm units with so for the most part. And there's about 9 minie muskets with seemingly random stats, along with the fact that you have to give a unit a completely uniform armament means that you could have 2,499 lorenz rifles in your armory, But you're going to be stuck equipping your men with 1842 smoothbore muskets because you can't give them a single enfield rifle, It would have been cool to have these rifles with their unique names and descriptions but combine them into a single pool of weapons, Especially considering that confederate made arms are almost exclusively copies of weapons that already exist in the game eg. CS Richmond = Harpers Ferry 1855

The Organization in the game is weird, You have brigades which are your units under divisions which are under corps and you have to have officers as divisional, corps and brigade commanders for your units... But the divisional commanders don't appear in the battle at all, The corps officers operate like the generals in Total War boosting moral and effectiveness of troops within a radius and the brigade officers are commanding the units, But the divisional commanders are seemingly spanking their monkey back at camp.

The campaign is structured poorly, No matter if you win or lose a battle it continues to the next battle in an hisorical timeline, Only to abrupty shift from Cold Harbor to taking either richmond or Washington based on if you're the Union or Confederates. The heavy focus on history is good for single battles like in Gettysburg. But when you have a full campaign you're going to get whiplash from suddenly going from winning the war, to losing the war to suddenly defeating your enemy in a climactic final battle. Like the way the confederate campaign is structured.

And finally the game is objective and time limit focused in a really bad way, turning enemy soldiers into casualties and routing them doesn't help in the slightest since they have infinite amounts of manpower that scales based on the size of your army, The only viable strategy is to put the least amount of effort as you can towards completing your objective. so you can preserve your forces and not get fired, Making the game a whole lot of cheese. that in itself is the biggest reason i'd never recommend this game to anyone in it's current state.

Only downside for now is the lack of MP for those who are looking for that sort of content, and the inability to name your officers... the latter of which is the one bit that somewhat takes away the immersion as you'll sometimes see 10 officers with the same last name commanding your troops.

The game itself is divided between the campaign camp where you create/reinforce the units of Infantry/Cavalry/Artillery of your army and the battle map which cover the main engagements of the civil war as well as many minor engagements in-between them. 

The campaign camp is quite simplistic, each part of your army is separated into Corps with several Divisions in each. These Divisions are then made up of infantry brigades (the bulk of any army) skirmishers (fast moving infantry but in small numbers) Cavalry (vulnerable when mounted but either great dismountable skirmishers or melee experts) and artillery of various sizes to give you long ranged firepower or devastating shorter-range canister shots.
 These units are persistent between battles and all can all be reinforced with green recruits or veterans (who cost more) from a manpower pool that increases depending on battle success.  Weapons are either purchased or captured in battle, reflecting the superiority of the Union industry the confederates also have issues with getting access to as many weapons but seem to have better officers. 

Battles are selected from the campaign map; the smaller battles are usually only for a maximum of 1 or 2 corps but grant lower rewards than the main ones. They also have some kind of effect on the main battle, so victory in them will deplete the enemy army or lower their morale for example. 
Controlling an army is simple, you can select units and drag an arrow to select their route or right click on a location so they move directly towards it. Finesse can be applied to rotate units by holding right mouse button, allowing flanking shots which devastate morale. There is a lot more to this game than just the basic parts I have explained here but Steam reviews can get a bit long so will leave it there! 

This game has been an excellent example of early access, the developer released a series of main battles which they then expanded out on a regular basis until its full launch in recent months. There were no real delays and consistent updates and information given to the community. The lack of multiplayer is a shame but since uptake of this feature in Gettysburg was very low it would have delayed the game significantly so I think the developers made the correct decision.

On easy the game is somewhat playable.  You can actually make progress but still feel like your on the edge of losing at any moment.  The enemy outnumber you in every single fight...  I tried a few other missions and it's the same thing, never will you have even strength battle, you are always outmanned and outgunned.

Then there is the problem with unit control.  Half the time you order your men to move, and you expect them to do such in a way that makes sense.  Every time a unit moves it get's rear flanked or just flanked...  Even if the front of the unit is still facing the enemy.  It dosn't make any sense.  Then the units go off on their own accord and do their own thing regardless of what you have instructed them.  This really gets frustrating when a unit is holding the line on a flank and decides randomly, that they want to charge out of cover headlong into 1000 muskets aimed their way and get mowed down.  Then your flank collapses and you lose the battle, even though YOU NEVER GAVE THE ORDER.

I just can't handle this game.  It is incredibly difficult and it puts you into perplexing scenarios that in reality would be entirely un-winnable yet it expects you to win them.  The battles are not historically accurate in the least which really removes any interest I had in the game since it already failed me in the strategy department.

Unfortunately I'm too far in that I can't refund it now.  Just save yourself the time, money and frustration and find something else to play.",1502142093,1502142093,False,4,1,0.430930107831954956,2,True,False,False

I was a huge fan of Ultimate General Gettysburg (UGG) and was really excited that the developers were going to make a sequel but sadly it feels like all the changes they made created an experience that had more breadth than the original but also far less depth with respect to the history and the subject matter involved.  A lot of the mechanics also seemed to have been ""dumbed down"" for the lack of a better term.

Ultimate General Civil War is nominally a brigade level tactical strategy game with a strategic overlayer set in the American Civil War.  The core game play experience involves maneuvering brigades of troops and batteries of artillery to re-fight battles that occurred during the war.  The game attempts to model factors such as morale or troops, the amount of cover they have to work with in any given terrain they are placed, and overall fighting effectiveness in a stat they call ""condition"".  Most of the game is played on an overhead view where you direct units into positions on a battle map.  The best comparison would be the Total War series and the control scheme is very similar.  In the campaign mode, this is supplemented by a strategy layer where your success or failure affects your ability to acquire ""funds"" and a manpower pool from which to improve your army.  You can add new brigades, supply replacements to offset casualties, equip them with better weapons as they become available and assign commanders to each unit.  Losses sustained in the tactical game mode carry over from battle to battle and troops that fight and survive gain veteran bonuses that can scale dramatically so it creates a strong incentive to preserve troops.

On the positive side, the game retains and improves its excellent visuals from its predecessor.  All the maps are beautifully presented and despite the fact the men are abstracted, the game conveys scale very well by showing small images of soldiers marching in formation and loading and firing of their weapons.  The interface is also largely untouched from the previous allowing you the traditional select, click to move for units and also the drawing of movement paths in the shape of arrows to more precisely outline routes.  Additional functionality has been added to be able to deploy multiple brigades into line at a particular location cutting down on the amount of clicking one needs to do.

The game does feature a very large number of maps.  All major battles of the Eastern Theater are in the game as well as several notable battles of the Western Theater.  In addition over 35 smaller battles and skirmishes are in the game in the form of side missions in the campaign that a player can complete to get extra rewards and weaken the computer opponent prior to a major battle.  It is advisable to complete all of them with some exceptions which will be noted below.  Overall the campaign features a good reward system where good performance means a better army with more veteran units which allows you to 'snowball' somewhat.  

The tradeoff for this campaign system and the dilution of focus away from a single battle to covering the entire Civil War though has lead to some serious downsides and is definitely a big minus for the game.  The first major issue is that in covering so many battles, it fails to present choice and consequence within some of the more complex multiday battles that they attempt to model.  In many multiday battles such as Chickamauga and Shiloh, your results do not carry over from day to day.  A typical example would be the Union army managing to fight off the surprise attack and hold onto the perimeter at Shiloh Church.  At the end of the day, the game will disregard whatever territory you held and proceed to start day 2 at its historical jumping off point at Pittsburg Landing carrying over only casualties sustained and inflicted.

This is especially jarring for veteran players of the predecessor UGG which carefully sculpted multiple branching scenarios and offered overall strategy choices for the player and the computer opponent.  If the Union held Seminary ridge on day 1, UGG would offer a spate of scenarios on day 2 which would make fit with your accomplishments on day 1.  In UG Civil War, the game jarringly throws you back onto Cementery Hill and Cementery Ridge regardless of what happened.  The entire experience is railroaded onto historical timelines regardless of whether those strategies executed even make sense given what the player's actions are.   Part of historical war gaming is the ""what if"" factor, the joy of exploring different outcomes even if it is only within the confines of a game.  Ultimate General Civil War offers none of that.

This is compounded by the fact that since you customize and make your own army during the campaign, the order of battle and rosters of divisions for the battles it models will inevitably be inaccurate.  When you fight Antietam during the campaign, it will not be with Hooker's Corps in the north and Burnside's south at the bridge.  The battles you fight and win have no effect on the campaign.  Did you crush Stonewall Jackson at Second Manassas?  Well despite destroying half of Lee's army Antietam will happen anyways.  Victories and defeats very quickly feels meaningless beyond trying to win in order to earn more money to get better gear for you men and raise more brigades.

The Historical Battles option in the game somewhat alleviate this issue by supplying the player with a historical order of battle for scenarios but they still suffer from the issue of not adjusting to player gains or losses on positions and shoehorning the player to historical outcomes regardless of what happens in game.  As such, a player's ability to explore the alternative histories of any individual battle is severely limited and feels shallow and unsatisfying.

Whats more, weapons are modeled seemingly for the sake of having some sort of selection in the game.  Their statistics are not at all reflective of reality.  Examples include the game offering the player a variety of muskets to outfit each brigade.  You have old smoothbore 1842, Springfield models 1855, 1861, and 1863.  For some bizarre reason, the old smoothbore 1842s have a very high melee rating compared to later rifled muskets.  There is no historical basis for this.  It leads to bizarre player choices like having a dedicated assault brigades armed with old 1842s simply because they do better in melee.  Similarly, Springfield muskets 1855 to 1863 are pretty much identical in terms of battlefield performance, yet the game would have you believe that the 1863 can shoot significantly farther and more accurately than an 1855.  This type of arcade management for the sake of having it is unwelcome from this player's point of view.

Finally the tactical gameplay changes arguably make the game worse by stripping tactical complexity, creating needless micromanagement, and adding absurdly unrealistic tactics which are even more egregious than an arcade style title like the Total War series.  One exceedingly offending example follows.

You have the ability to fire into melee combat with any and all weapons and not result in any friendly losses.  This creates absurd situations where you line up cannon and veteran troops equipped with weapons that have a good ranged shot rating behind poorly eqipped expendable brigades that will shield your troops and cannon from fire and when they engage in melee your good troops and cannon then fire INTO the melee and absolutely massacre the enemy brigades with no ill consequence.  This was a staple tactic on defense I used repeatedly.

Overall this game is a serious downgrade from Ultimate General Gettysburg.  I cannot recommend this game.",1501985144,1501985156,False,151,8,0.798480510711669922,9,True,False,False

I have a few complaints that aren't really complaints so much as suggestions.

1. It seems not all cavalry can dismount. I realize some weapons aren't too useful off of a horse but, in a pinch, it would still be good to dismount my men.
2. They need to add a firing withdrawl and not the crazy scramble that is the fallback or rout command.
3. More weapon variety (small arms). That's more because I'm greedy. The current variety assuredly is good.

The level of detail in how you organise and equip your army is a fantastic feature for the obsessive compulsive minded. I have not seen anything like this in any other tactical wargame. 

Note that this game is all about flanking. Secure your flanks to ensure you don't lose; ensure you are able to roll up the enemy's flank to achieve victory. The casualty rate for flanked units seems artifically high. For artillery one could justify high casualties if round ball bounced along an entire line of infantry, but rifle shot would not affect more soldiers just because you have a side angle. One other annoying feature is that you often don't have much freedom to choose the initial placement of your army, or the time and rate of reinforcements in large battles.

AI leaves somethings to be desired. Competent enough to put on a challenge initially but can be figured out pretty quickly. Game relies on giving the AI better equipment and more manpower to provide most of the challenge.

If there was a middle option I would probably have gone for that instead.

The issue for me is the sort of 'Rights of Passage' arrangement chosen for the first two missions in each campaign.  Most strategy gamers would expect the early missions in any campaign to be reasonably easy, and merely intended to ease the player into the use of the game system with a minimal  challenge.

Not so, with this game.  So, far I can honestly say that the first two battles in both the USA and CSA campaigns have been the most difficult and frustrating of any that I have fought since.  Apart from the nature of the missions themsevles, which are very challenging for a new player, the game employs a scaling mechanism which if the player is not aware of it can make the second battle in each campaign even harder than it needs to be by artificially boosting the AI's troop numbers.  This despite the claims that that the scaling has been removed.  It hasn't, it has merely been scaled down, and after mission 2 it ceases to have much of an impact, but for new players whose natural instinct is to maximise the size of their army after the first battle it is a major headache adding anything up to 2.000 extra troops to the AI army.

I suspect that like me many new players will struggle to complete the first two battles in each campaign and many probably give up and stop playing the game.  I am lucky in that I kept banging away at these early missions, partly because I was trying to work out how the scaling worked, and having finally got past them I have found the game much more enjoyable.

Not sure what the developers were going for with the decision to make these early battles so hard to complete, but if it was to put players off playing the game I'm sure it has been a stunning success.  If you are thinking of buying this game, or struggling to get past the second battle, you have my sympathy, but keep plugging away.

The game offers the ability to play out the major engagements of the war, such as Antietam, Gettysburg, and Cold Harbor, as well as custom battles.

I very much enjoyed UG:Gettysburg and much of what makes that game successful was transferred here.  The strategic layer that was added as the stepping stone between the mostly historical battles in this game is fun and I spent a lot of time tweaking my units.  History buffs may want to suspend disbelief at that camp screen as the base rifle for all units is called ""farmer"" or ""hunter"".  Not sure why units couldn't just start out with historical weapons, but oh well.  Also smoothbore muskets are given weaker damage and there seems to be no knowledge on the parts of the developers on the use of ""buck and ball"" for smoothbores which was devastating for units at close range (Irish Brigade loved their .69 smoothbores).  But that is a minor quible.  The heart of the game is the tactical battles, a la UG:G.  Here is where the real problems occur.  Often times a battle goes really well and occurs in a way that tactically makes sense and is historically accurate, even if you lose you still understand why.  Sometimes, battles turn into situations where AI hordes are charging all over the screen.  When these situations occur you will now find yourself in a battle that seems to resemble the Total War series.  There seems to be little rhyme or reason why one unit breaks or holds fast in these situations.  I've seen vastly outnumber units hold firm against a charge and I've seen three star units of superior strength run for the hills.  Also, surrendering seems to be totally random.  The most frustruating flaw in the tactical battles is the enemy units penchant for routing through your lines, regrouping and then taking rear objectives.  Some of the battles need to have their maps redrawn.  I was able to inflict 3 to 1 casualties on the US AI at Antietam, but could not help getting overrun on Marye's Heights at Fredericksburg.  The scale on the Fredericksburg map seems to be off and results in the Union troops starting really close to the Confederate troops.  Fredericksburg is the site of another frustration, which is that on some maps you get to repair your unit dispositions and other times you don't.  I can't explain why the Confederate commander cannot lay out his troops for Fredericksburg, a battle where the confederates were on the defense and had days to prepare their positions.  Also, the defensive strongpoints on most maps will actually lead a novice player to their doom as the AI rarely attacks those locations front a direction that would be beneficial to those units.  Unlike UG:G, there are no terrain lines and you have really no idea where is best to locate artillery for observation and advantage.  I learned to keep my artillery really close to the front because there seems to be no damage advantage to owning the heigher ground.  It seems to be impossible to kill opposing generals even if they walk into multiple infantry volleys.  Overall, it is a game with a lot of potential and if you don't mind reloading a battle multiple times after the AI routes multiple units into your rear area then you will enjoy it.",1500854037,1500854037,False,3,0,0.485557764768600464,1,True,False,False

This game is complex and very challenging, but relatively easy to get the hang of after a few hours of play.

The most difficult aspect of the game is simply managing your army between battles, especially early on. It can be quite challenging to know how best to invest your finite money and reputation points ahead of time. In addition, there’s a dizzying variety of period accurate weapons available to equip your army with. Here too is a delicate balancing act that one must perform with limited resources. Most of the best weapons, as one would expect, are extremely scarce and expensive and only gradually become available as the game progresses. If you’re playing as the Confederacy, you’ll find yourself equipping new brigades with mostly captured weapons.

That said, I really like that there’s an added incentive to not just win a battle, but to inflict as many casualties on your enemy as possible. Doing so will directly affect the number of troops your opponent will have available for deployment in the next battle, not to mention adding to your cache of captured weapons. You’ll definitely find yourself on occasion playing long past the allotted time in order to bloody your opponent as much as possible, especially when you have the upper hand in a battle.

There are still some weird things that can occur, and as you can read in other ""reviews"" one of them is morale blows when being flanked. Sometimes this can feel overly punitive, and again you can read how this alone has made people downvote the game.

Essentially a unit you might feel is in a good spot gets ""flanked"" and thats the rub, sometimes it doesn't feel like a flank... at least not a full on flank you might be imagining in your head.
So clean that up.

But.....
it happens RARELY!
Heres what they are very likely doing wrong, putting a low level unit in a bad spot (or key position on the line) having a low level officer, having a low level Corps commander, not having the Corps commander in the area that is being pressured.

Add those up... downvote


Pace feels good, not too fast not too slow.
Although foot speed should be higher going up hills (not by much)

Enemy scaling feels alot better
Charging is effective (when used intelligently) dont just run up to a unit behind a wall that is not wavering and has support and expect a good result...

Cav is in a good place, yes melee cav is kinda weak at low levels, and with poor equipment. So be careful with them

I've played alot, never had a crash, never had a game breaking bug.
Patches have been coming in at a good pace.
They are well explained.
Im sure people want more contact and info, but thats a standard gripe.

My one complaint, counter battery fire, specialty long range cannnons!!! I want this to be more effective!

So basically, if warfare of this kind is interesting to you, I highly reccomend this game.
Having some understanding of tactics and what the weapons did historically (in general) will help alot. AKA no COD warriors.

I really hope this game evolves further into Total War style game.
Campaign map, battle map. I would buy it for a few of my friends, buy them beer and make them play one weekend

Hope you enjoy the game, because frankly I want more of them

But for a developer to introduce such a polished project and then with the communities help create something with such masssive potential. It's testament to their hard work and vision. If you just look at the game, it is a thing of beauty. The maps are amazing. Add some more detail and grapical enhancements such as fog, rain, flame/fire and of course blood and I for one would be a happy man. Army management is key in this game and something I've probably not mastered as yet. You build an army and you go to war. On the campaign trail you get it wrong and it can be good night Vienna.

For a time, the reinforcement pool that the opposition would draw on would be relatively static. This lead to a number of negative reviews due to the game being unfairly difficult. You'd destroy the enemy army in a battle, but the next one they would be even larger and well equipped despite the casualties inflicted. With the 0.90 update of a dynamic enemy army size, this is no longer a problem and I am enjoying my Legendary difficulty run right now.

Let's start off with this. The game is grueling, with the lead game designer being the man behind the DarthMods of several Total War game. The AI is much more difficult to handle than any present in the Total War franchise, especially the entries with the closest in era, (Empire & Napoleon). 

The game also plays much more differently than the aforementioned games. Instead of infantry regiments, you'll be working with entire brigades as a singular unit. Battles will require you to manage multiple divisions at once. In more ways than one, the game is very macro-tactical. You're not so much worried about the formation of a single unit, than you are about your entire force as a whole. If this wasn't clear, [u]do not[/u] play this as if it were Total War. You're going to have a bad time and be frustrated if you do.

For those interested in getting attached to their units, much like XCOM, you'll be happy to know that brigade names are completely customizable. Considering how valuable veteran units and officers are, you will get attached to them as if your battles depended on them... because they do. It is rewarding to see scruffy units full of recruits turn into battle-hardened heroes throughout your campaign. 

It's a must-have for anyone interested in this period of conflict and strategy. Considering it is on sale, I would grab it. This is a promising game coming from an indie studio that surely will bring quality strategy games in the future.

Edit [18 July 2017]:
The game has finally released out of early access and there's a few things that I want to add to the consumer that wants some straightforward info that I left out in my original review - note that I still wholeheartedly recommend this game.

Even at release, there are some frustrating things with the game and that comes down to the level design or at least flow design of certain campaigns. You'll find yourself managing different parts of a battle at different times. Sometimes when the part of the map switches, you won't have access to some trips that you were relying on, or the position they start in isn't optimal and you have no say on how they are placed. I found myself forgiving this in early battles, but in later battles I found it annoying since more was on the line. I found it especially annoying since many of the early battles still allowed you to place units in certain positions even when ""taken by surprise"". 

I found that sometimes the enemy reinforcement pool would not apply to certain battles, most noticeably the final battles of both campaigns, (Washington and Richmond). By that I mean, I would crush the enemy army to only have 50k troops, and yet there would be 105k+ waiting for me around Richmond. I only barely forgive this because it would be a dull and anti-climactic end to a campaign. It is rather depressing to get to the end of your campaign after many hard fought battles to attrit the enemy, only to find that it was useless just within arm's reach of the final goal.

On a historical note, I noted that casualties for battles, especially on harder difficulties, would be extraordinarily high compared to history. Battles like the 2nd Bull Run would have 90k in casualties. To put that in perspective, Gettysburg had ~40k casualties for both sides total. This can be a turn off to some, but a more accurate representation would just result in units running away more - so for the sake of mechanics, this is fine in my eyes but it may not be for you.

Again, I still recommend this game. The fact that a game with a relatively static campaign can allow for more in-depth tactical and strategic-level thinking than the open campaigns of the newer Total Wars can is fantastic.",1498568765,1500358049,True,63,1,0.843216657638549805,1,True,False,False

You start in command of a single small Corps of ~4 Infantry Brigades and supporting arms, and go from there.  The Game progesses through sort of a ""Greatest Hits"" of the civil war, encapsulating all of the major battles of the conflict, while using ""side-quest"" battles to simulate some of the smaller actions.

Everytime you take the field you have the chance to earn valuable experience for your troops and (arguably more importantly) your officers.  Each victory also earns you ""Reputation"" which may be spent (this simulates political maneuvering, I assume) in order to get your Corps assigned the best officers and more modern equipment.

***

That game pretty rapidly goes from Napoleonic field maneuver warfare with highly innaccurate Springfield '42's to basically Trench Warfare a-la the Somme with startlingly accurate high end rifled muskets or even Repeater Carbines, turning your brigades into machine-gun toting bad asses.


The AI doesn't cheat, relentlessly seeks to turn your flank and aggressively exploits every advantage it can find.  You, the player, must always strike a balance between bold aggression and preserving your army - until you Conquer Washington/Richmond there's *always* a next battle. 

I personally really get a lot out of watching my Corps/Army develop, I name my Brigades as I form them (so they don't get renamed when there are new officers) and on my most recent Union playthrough I used one of the units the game gives you in the Tutorial to Capture Richmond.  They'd been with me through the whole war, fighting on after atrocious losses.  It seemed fitting that they close it out.

(Over 1000 hours on Europa Universalis 4.) So, trust me when I say this feels like a must-have strategy game. Originally when I first saw it I was like; eh... But, I decided to give it a try as a history buff wanting to learn more about the Civil War. Pretty early on I learned that I loved it; right at the start you get to choose your Academy for your General, what they studied, how they served, how they spent their service - giving you various points to your varied stats list; which to me is just... A fantastic idea that more strategy games should implement; it allows for a great amount of replability. 

Next, is the AI - the AI is truly intelligent I feel; it's not just spamming troops of sending them towards the grinder; it actively thinks about your potential moves and likely positions and acts on them. There's been more than one occassion where I've laughed evily and rubbed my hands together thinking: ""I've got 'em now!"" Only to have a mass of calvery show up on the very back of the map, as the AI took the time to flank -all- the way around me. This just adds more replability; I don't think I've played the same level and have the same thing happen at all. 

Finally, there's the leveling system for your officers and the gear for your army. It's -awesome- addition that again adds to replability. Are you going to go for a veteran unit with a fast reload time, or are you going to go for a massive recruit army that has high quality, accurate guns? Maybe use a recruit army as a sponge and flank around the sides with your veterans? Who knows; the possibilities seem endless. 

I'm really looking forward to see what the Developers do and add; and hopefully they go on to make another great game series or DLC - word up to the Developer, I think this type of game-mechanics and such would work awesome in a WW1 setting, or even WW2; or if you really want to get creative, maybe a less-studied war like the War of 1812, or one of the many European Wars in this time-line.

It is still not perfect, the gameplay still needs to improve. The campaign also is not going to keep you replaying forever. But all these things can be improved and expanded with DLCs, addons or a sequel.

The AI is quite good, although I think it should be simulating different general types (cautious like McClelland, aggressive like Lee, Grant etc). Right now there is no consideration of the opposite general and the game could benefit greatly from this.

Graphics in this game is very good and shows a keen eye for small detail. Same with sound and ambience which is top notch in battles although some voiceovers are more funny than anything (like when in the army camp suddenly someone shouts ""Sir, Yes Sir!"", totally startling the player)

This is the closest thing to the ideal Civil War campaign simulation I've always dreamed of when I was playing Robert E. Lee Civil War General back in the late 90s.

Difficulty:
Insane difficulty issue has indeed been resolved; or so it seems since I haven't played the game when comments section was bloodied with angray rants about impossible enemy troop sizes. Up until now I haven't encountered any situations where even careful min-maxing the situation was not enough to overcome the odds. When the battle seems impossible, try to ignore the default directions given at the beginning of the stages, and flank the enemy as much as possible. This game heavily rewards ANY breach in the line defense structure, and AI is significantly at a disadvantage when it comes to shifting the defense line to respond to any flanking forces.

Army Management:
If you remember R.E.Lee Civil War General's army progression where you buy better weapons for your units with the money you've earned, you will be pleasantly surprised to find that Ultimate General: Civil War is an enhanced version in every way. Now you can adjust brigade sizes, add traits to your brigades as they gain exp, and make your very own corp in any composition you prefer.

Generals and brigades all level up, adding to the efficiency and resilience of the troops. Also, YOU as the commander of the 1st corp gain ""career points"". These points can be spent to improve many aspects of the game, such as expanding the army hiearchy structure (more brigades per division, more division per corp and so on), increasing the gold and recruits you get for each battles, decreasing the costs of veteran troops, and even reconnaisance which lets you know your enemy army's sizes and equipment level in advance

Gameplay:
the game runs in real time, but you can pause it anytime you want to better assess the situation. Basically you control every brigades on the battlefield (even the ones not from your own corp). If you find controlling 20~30 brigades at once too tedious, you can let the AI take over by division level. AI then automatically controls the brigades in the designated divisions according to the aggresive/defensive mode you can switch at any time. However, it is much better to control the brigades yourself, since those AI controlled divisions can ruin your game if unattended. Then again, if you're going to keep close eyes on your AI divisions, you might as well control them.

General battles feels legit and real. Using covers and maneuvering the terrains to flank the opponent are absolutely necessary if you want to win battles with minimal losses. Battles are fun and satisfying because of fluent animation and captivating sound effects. 4 unit types - infantry, cavalry, artillery and skirmishers - each has their role, and knowing their limits will be very important in conserving your men and preventing needless casualties.


Summary:
- difficulty issue has been completely resolved
- gameplay is addicting and fluent
- army management is detailed but not overly meticulous
- design of unit types fit their roles, although infantry will likely take about 70~80% of the gameplay

If you're a Civil War games fan, then this game is a MUST BUY
If you're into real-time battle simulation games such as total war series, I highly recommend buying the game

The developers have included a wide variety of features including: the possibility to build, arm, and level your troops through combat; you can incease your character's competance as a military officer by gaining rank and through increasing his abilities by developing his skills by winning battles;  there is a wide array of historical officers that you can recruit and give them the command of their historical outfits (e.g. Samuel Carroll's ""Gibraltar Brigade); and much more.

The open and large maps, attention to detail, history, morale, fairly decent graphics, gore, and strategy were outstanding. It was historical but not confining. This game is a long way off from that classic.

First the biggest pro: Historical tactic battlefield game! 10/10

Pro:
- Civil war theme
- Army management, but not a grand strategy game, you can feel yourself like a real general
- Harcore tactic game, you can't buy/build during the battle, so you need to be prepared before the battle
- Good carreer management, you can try different ways to win
- Lot of historical battle, weapon, units and generals
- Some combats are small, some battles are big, so it feels you are a command follower, like a real general
- Confoderation lack the manpower and supply, like in real history (hope it never change, historically accurate games are rare)

Contra:
- Still some bugs
- Cavalry need a little rebalancing, to much micro commands yet
- Artillery bombardment is not useful, just close canister shots, so need some long range buff I think so


Not a contra, but my opinion: this game is a little bit expensive for 28 euro (2017.07.12), but It absolutly worth the price when you like such games.

This isn't as gritty as titles like Forge of Freedom, but it is a very fun game and has something for casual gamers who want beautiful graphics and serious strategy fans.  I would warn you that in it's current iteration, the game isn't as strategic as hardcore grognards would like.  It is relatively easy to beat the CPU on the easiest mode, but other levels offer a bigger challenge.

The strategic game doesn't have a strat map like Forge of Freedom.  The campaign is scripted and linear.  How you perform in the minor battles (and you can skip them if you want) will determine how your army (and the opponent) is set up for the major battles.  You have to make some tough choices in deciding whether to field a large, poorly-equipped army or a smaller and well-armed army of veterans.  Even on the easiest level, you won't be able to buff your army into max size and best weapons for each unit.  The campaign is too hard for that, even in easy mode.

I encountered only one minor bug in my 50+ hours of game play, and that was on a startup screen, so I never lost any game time.

My only issue with gameplay is that the game engine will let you (and the computer will do it instictively) keep feeding chewed up units into combat until they wither away permanently when they have lost 70% or more troops.  While this happened to a few units in the actual Civil War, most units that lost even 30% of their men as casualties in any given day were cosidered too torn up to put back into line. If this game were perfect, it would account for that and battles would end more quickly when one side had virtually no units left to use.  That army would withdraw quickly in real life, trying not to be captured.  In UG:CW, the computer will throw units that have lost 60% of their men back into the maelstrom until they all evaporate or surrender.

But overall, this is a relatively easy to learn game that is a tremendous value at this price.  You can play it so many ways, including just stand-alone battles with completely historical units.

If you play the campaign, my advice is that it's better to have a 1,500 man brigade with good weapons (the $25 or $30 rifles) than a 2,500 man unit with the $5 rifles.  I buy enough vets to keep my best units at about 75% quality (moral, firearms, efficiency) and use big rookie units to mop up and gain experience.  Once I get a brigade maxed out with it's quality, I buy rookie replacements until it drops back into the 75% quality range.  I can get a big brigade of 2,000+ troops at about 75%-80% quality and armed with CS Richmonds or some top-quality rifles.

Three last tips: 1) be very careful not to charge cavarly into a prepared unit of infantry.  Cavalry is VERY expensive and hard to keep at vetaran status if you waste it. I typically avoid combat with my cavalry as much as possible, and use it to ride down supply wagons and unsupported artillery.  That is what is best at.

2) I never spend money or unit slots on skirmishers.  It is far cheaper to just have an infantry brigade with good rifles (Lorenz, Enfield, Richmonds, etc) split off a unit of skirmishers.  I use them as scouts when pushing my army forward to make sure that there aren't any enemies waiting to pounce on my flanks.  Then I use the skirmisher units to work around enemy flanks to gert the flanking bonus. 

3) like in the real life Civil War, there is no danger to your troops as deadly as flanking fire. If you send a unit forward on its own with no flankers, it will get chewed up, and even a veteran unit like the ones I described above will panic and rout quickly if it flanked or surrounded.  ALWAYS protect your flanks with other units and skrimishers.",1499555993,1499555993,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Those side missions can do you more harm than good. Killed 6000 soldiers? Too bad the enemy gets them all back. AND MORE. That is nice.

Have fun seeing those 1000+ skirmisher per troop or the near 3k infantrie squads. Or the fact that they don't give single damn about condition (read: stamina) and recover from routing way faster. Or outright 'retreat' towards you.

But I could forgive all of that, aside from the last one maybe the AI can be pretty stupid after all. If it weren't for 1 thing: they can fire through their own troops.

To elaborate: If a unit of yours, that is not artillery, is behind one of your troops it is unable to fire since... well friendly fire (lets ignore that it doesn't exist in this game) would be bad. They also can't shoot if the 'blocked' unit is on a hill and the 'blocking' unit at the foot of said hill. They can fire into the melee of one of your units though.

Now I have seen it a couple of times (mainly when they focus a single unit) that the Ai, as you can probably guess, outright says 'screw the rules' and does exactly that: Form double line and fire massive volleys at you. Either let the player also do that or fix it.

This is a good game, and if they tweak it a little bit, it might become a great game. 

What I like is the epic feeling of battles, involving thousands of troops in beautifully set landscapes that pan out very close to the actual locations of the battles. Once you get past the scripted goal of the battles, you can draw out battles for quite some time, and fight the enemy to the last man in a good recreation of the churning machinery of death that was the civil war. Really great is the implementation of a supply wagon system, which your men and the enemy depend upon to have amunition to go on fighting.

On the negative side are some of the battle control mechanisms. For instance, if I want to move an entire line of men forward in formation, sometimes I accidentally drag the mouse slightly wrong and all my companies will start rearranging how they are lines up, and thousands will be killed in the process. There is still a lot that has to be improved here. In the meantime I will move my companies one by one.
Also I have a dislike for the strong scripting of the larger battles and the fact that I am always fighting not only the enemy, but also the clock. This can be very frustrating as, just when I am about to break the enemy lines, the game will tell me that now is the time to jump to the next phase of the battle, or that the enemy has decided to withdraw to a position far away from where I am now. This really is a bit frustrating.

As a player of many years, I have learned to shut up, move past the bugs and enjoy the things that actually work while waiting for the inevitable patches. 

Is it worth the price? The jury is still out on that one. If you are a casual strategist with a short attention span and little patience, I'd say way til the price comes down. But most strategy addicts will probably enjoy this.

Almost as if the narrator is blind to what is actually going on. An I get it, the game it trying to keep historically accurate to certain events.

Game is still in development and judging from the forums there is a good level of dialogue between the devs and the community, certainly seems to be a title that will go from strength to strength and not just be dropped.

At this point I'd played too many hours and my request for a refund got declined. 

At least I learned somehting new about history, mainly that the South won the War of the States due to their vastly superior numbers and much better weapons.

*EDIT*

On account of supposed balance changes made since I last played the game I decided to give it a go again. After all the game is in early release, some rough edges are to be expected. 

I played the first mission, as the Union. It took great effort to secure the little town that is the player's first objective, but it was possible. Throughout this first step I was treated to a number of little tips in handy dialog boxes, warning me against risky frontal charges and advicing me to keep my units' flanks and rears secure. 

After this initial stage I set up a defence around the town center, hiding my line infantry behind barricades with supporting skirmishers positioned to take best advantage of cover. I redied myself for the enemy, who would have to cross wide open areas to attack my position. 

Surely, shortly thereafter arrived Johnny Reb. The AI dropped any and all attempts at subtlety, and went for a frontal charge across the line. Just what I had hoped for.

My skirmishers maneuvered behing enemy units, discharging their guns into their uprocted rears. My lines fired a salvo, then another. My artillery roared a welcome of grapeshot at the Dixie attack. 

They did not blink. They did not slow down. They did not break.

In seconds, it was over. The rebels took the bullets head-on, their bodies taking Minié balls like reinforced concrete. The distance closed, the slaughter began. Frenzied southerners ripped through hundreds of Union soldiers in an instant. The Union fought back. Bayonets ripped through muscle and sinew, rifle butts shattered skulls. But the rebels would. Not. DIE. 

Having spend the better part of half an hour, I could do nothing as my defence was destroyed by an enemy using tactics the game had helpfully informed me were inefficient, careless and wasteful. To say I was frustrated is an understatement.

I can only conclude that ""Ultimate General: American Civivl War"" takes place in some strange alternate reality where the South employed super powered zombies to annihilate the Northern army.

The developers have resolved these issues.  Just as importantly, they have introduced enough details to help determine how you want to utilize your resources battle to battle.

Beyond those issues, I've always loved the game design itself.  The graphics and scenarios are comprehensive and amazing.  Strategy is involved; not cookie cutter.  The leeway given to design ones army--making tradeoffs for size, skill, weaponry and composition--on top of choices about where you chose to engage, how you position your troops, and when to fight make each battle creative and engaging.  Moreover, the battlefield designs are detailed, vast and enhance strategy options.

Great graphics but most inportant is that army management and officers is very well done and together with brigades experience progression it makes you really attached to your army as a whole. Many other  positive aspects of the game are well described by other comments anyway. 
The only little minus would be the sound effects used in the game. Would be nice to have more;  sound of drums for instance. Some flags and different uniforms too maybe. It's a pre-release so hopefully the game will be more polished in that aspect. Still a no-brainer buy anyway.

A quality game that has all the features a war/strategy game should. Ultimate General does an excellent job of putting you in charge of either the union or confederate army. Every decision is important. You will create the armies. You'll decide how many soldiers to have in it. You'll pick the general. You'll make all the big decisions. One example is how much will you spend on weapons for the army you create in your division? Yes, you decide how to equip each soldier in your army. Spend more for better (faster loading) weapons may be a good choice but it may cost you in other areas such as how many cannons you'll have on the field. Each rifle has different benefits from rate of fire to distance to accuracy - with the better weapons costing more money.

Once in a battle  the way you move your troops  (can you get the advantage by getting behind or to the side of the enemy) and the risks you are willing to take - all will have an impact on the battle. This game starts off with two ""intro"" battles that are challenging and do a good job of showing you tactics. One example is placing an army in the way of the enemy troops to stall the attack. Doing so may give you time for reinforcements to arrive which can have a big impact on the battle.

One of the first things you notice is that the game is quite straightforward to get into. Quite a few ""hardcore"" strategy games fill the interface with lots and lots and lots of buttons/indicators/status reports and such, requiring you to read a massive manual (or a long youtube tutorial) before even beginning. UG is quite easy to understand the basics if you played any TW game. All key stats are easy to see.

At the same time, the battle mechanics are very deep and quite different from other games in the genre. Positioning and expoiting enemy weaknesses are essential to win with manageable casualties. The whole technology era (where both sides started the war with militia armed with napoleonic-era muskets and ended with breech-loaded weapons and even some repeater weapons) forces you to adapt tactics as the game progresses. 

The grand campaign (as either side in the war) takes you through virtually every single battle in the war, with your army following you through the whole game. Between battles you refill your troops with recruits, manage officers, form new units, manage your armament inventory. Since your army is persistent and carries over from battle to battle, you need to make a lot of strategic choices to mnage your resources. Which unit would you prioritise for veteran reinforcements and best equipment. Do you really want to get commit your elites now and take losses, or wait until later and potentially run out of time to fulfill your objective? Do you want to make your cavalry charge and silence that enemy artillery which is shelling your army, but likely lose the cavalry in the process?  And so on...

Throughout your campaign you will face an enemy army which will change depending on how you fight them, making enemy casualties actually matter. Though the enemy army will never be fully destroyed, fighting them well pays off, even if you don't win everything. Battles are split into ""sub-campaigns"" which consist of several smaller battles and a major battle which is fought over several days. In large battles towards the endgame, you can end up with up to 100 separate units (regiments, artillery batteries) and the battles truly feel huge. 

A note: the game is quite hard. No matter which side you pick first, you may be better off starting on easy until you feel you understand the game (both tactical and strategic).

I may try doing that on purpose next time to see how hard it would be to ultimately win, just like what really happened.  Haven't tried the Confederates yet.  It'll be interesting to see if early battles are easy and later ones hard, even if you've won all the early ones.

Couple of hints.  Don't buy too many expensive weapons you might lose to the enemy.  You really have to protect them.  So have some not so good weapons you aren't afraid take risks with.  In close combat, high malee might be best anyway, and they aren't that expensive.  Also hold back from charging with low energy troops.  The hold button is needed to keep rouge officers from charging on their own (very realistic proplem).  The ""split skirrmashes off brigade"" button for a large group is handy to offer two areas or directions to fight from.

Tho a good game, there badly needs to be these improvements.  First an option to man the walls when you move troops into a fort.  I could not get single units to set themselves up to fire in more than one direction.  Second, you need to be able to close doors to forts that cannons would have to blast open.  It is way too easy for calvery or whatever to just waltz right into a fort.  Third, exhausted or retreating troops should never head towards the enemy!

All in all tho a great game that keeps you informed and keeps you in fairly good control of what is going on.  I love being able to assign weapons, leaders, and add types of units.  It is also neat to get breifings prior and during battles, yet the fog of war keeps the enemy cloaked until they get near.

I've now played the Confederate. Other than Ft. Sumpter, it is fairly easy to win on the Colonel level. A badly needed improvement is when you want to fall back with a unit. Now they turn their backs to the enemy! They should just back step, continuing to face the enemy, like to nearby better cover.

After some initial frustrating moments (especially in the Union campaign) I actually managed to win a couple of battles on normal difficulty. However, so far it all comes down to numbers, at least as far as I can judge it. If you don't invest all your experience points in increasing your brigade/division/corps strength early on you're pretty much f...d. I did it the wrong way with the Confederates first and ended up at a point where I could not field as many troops as the scenario allowed - loosing badly as a result. Instead of just allocating new recruits, the devs should rather give the player new regiments etc. It is also essential to bring your troops to max strength before a battle if you want to win, as the enemy will almost always have more and bigger regiments than the player (historically unrealistic as most regiments would start a battle well under strength unless fresh out of the depot), something Civil War Generals 2 did better twenty years ago. The penalty for fighting your opponent to a draw is also a bit harsh. A draw for the Union at 1st Bull Run would historically have been a minor success and should be rewarded for the Union player for instance. At the moment each draw is actually treated as a minor defeat. It might also be more motivating if the game would make a greater difference between the types of mission outcome, such as crushing defeat, minor defeat, draw, minor victory, major victory and reward these accordingly. As for the mission timer, I think an option to turn it off or allocate more time to a mission might be a good idea. At least if people want to sell the game to those potential buyers who just hate timers ;-).

The campaign now has a dynamic enemy army which changes in both size and quality according to how you perform against it in battles. It's now much more realistic, in the sense that when you defeat the enemy army it will be smaller and less well equipped in the next battle, translating to a better sense of progress and an overall easier game if you play well.

Original Review: I like this game, but cannot recommend it in it's current state. As a number of other reviewers have noted, scaling makes this game frustrating and in some battles nearly impossible. There are some battles where it simply isn't possible to win, even on the easiest setting, due to the objectives and the strength of the enemy. The developers have tried to make it easier by adding a ""fixed enemy strength"" option where the enemy has the same number of soldiers regardless of your army, but this has the effect of making the battles trivially easy.

There are a couple odd design choices that keep this from being the best Civil War RTS I have ever played (That award still going to the Scourge of War/Take Command series).

First and foremost, the Eastern and Western theatre of war are both mashed together, but only for the player. As the player, you will command, oddly, the one and only army the Confederates/Union have (Depending on side played), and fight battles in both the East and West. Problem is, the AI will have 2 seperate armies, East and West, with their own manpower pools.

This makes the game more difficult in a way it shouldn't be, and trust me the game is already difficult.

Competant AI makes for a tough fight most of the times, and most battles are lost by poor decision making on the Player's part.

But this isn't to say there isn't a slight amount of fuckery to some of the difficulty as well. Some ""Minor"" battles (Especially towards the end of the campaign) are so difficult, they are not worth the risk/reward. But if you DON'T do them, the major battle at the end of the phase will be even more difficult. 

This doesn't ruin the game by any stretch of the imagination, there is so much to the Campaign that it makes it a wonderful single player experience.

There is sadly, no Multiplayer, something I think would have been amazing, given the customization options and such in game. And, in this day and age, it's almost criminal for a game to not have MP.

The odder aspects of the campaign construction, the blindingly difficult learning curve, and the lack of MP are the only things that keep this game from being the BEST ACW RTS ever made.

That being said, it's still a solid, fun as hell game that puts other, bigger, more bombastic RTS games currently on the market (I am looking at you, Steel Division, you disgusting piece of trash  disguised as a good game) to shame. Good AI, Good mechanics, Great morale/LOS/combat system. This is Chess to Steel Division's Checkers.

After discovering a large gamebreaking patch, I decided to have another run through with UG: Civil War.  

Here's What I Think:

AI Difficulty

To start, I decided to test the difficulties.  In the past, no matter what skill level was played, the AI seemed to have full armies and good weapons, no matter how many losses they acrrued.  With the latest update, I tried the""easy"" skill level to see how things went.  From beginning to end, I literally stomped on the confederacy.  As the campaign unfolded I accrued total victories from one scenario to the other, beefing up my stats (which got to the point that after Gettysburg everything was maxed out except two of the given career point options), fielding a whole battalion of elite troops, maxing out all available top tier weapons, and getting kind of bored.  It was actually ""easy"".  I haven't tried the other difficulties, but given that easy is now easy, I imagine the difficulty increases with each setting.  

Career Options

I still don't like having to use career points to establish reconnaisance.  In fact, playing on easy, I realized the whole career-point allocation system could use a little work.  It needs more options, options that make sense, and the player shouldn't be able to master all career slots, but should have to choose his career direction by allocating most of his points in a given direction.  As I stated before, playing on easy, my general was a god.  Medicine was maxed out, army organization was maxed out, ect.  And I still had three more scenarios to go.  

This late in development I'm sure we won't see any changes to this part of the game, but they did make changes to the AI difficulty, which is significant.  I hope to see a broader, more complex career mechanic to enhance the feeling of being a general, being in a war, and not being a god.

My concern is that it limits replayability once the player learns that mid to late game the whole career thing actually isn't all that exciting.  

In addition, concerning leveling troops, I know there are options you can choose to make your regiments better, but I found the mechanic rather linear because I found that I usually chose the same options for every troop type.  Not enough variation.  

I feel the same way about weapon variations as well.  It's odd that every regiment has to be equipped with the same rifles or cannons.  There is no variation amidst the troops on what they are equipped with.  I know that would make the game more complex, but this could be mitigated by instead of purchasing individual weapons to have those weapons be called ""pachages"" or something.  For instance you purchase a package of muzzle loaders, the quality of the package and how it effects the troops firing range, ect. could be dependent what type and quantity of muzzle loaders are in that package.  It would solve the issue of not being able to bring more recruits into a regiment because I ran out of one particular type of weapon.  

The Battle Maps

I know the developers have received a lot of criticism on the new map system they've developed.  As a former player of Gettysburg, I absolutely missed not having the names of roads or farms or hills or ect.  It was a neat dynamic.  However, I've come to enjoy the new look and feel of the battle maps.  

One mechanic the developers haven't capitalized fully upon is the ability to zoom on the map.  Can you zoom, yes.  In and out and you can change the view so you can see the hills.  But what I would like to see are the names of the roads and the farms and the hills and ect when I fully zoom out.  It would help me piece together more accurately what is actually happening and where as the battle unfolds.  

Having an overlay map would provide a more historic feel, plus it would like cool, providing that ""Gettysburg"" kind of feel without ruining the current map design.  

Conclusion

Pros
*Battles are intense, fun, and original.  
*Maps are well constructed
*Visuals are unique and fun
*The ability to equip soldiers with better weapons to kill the enemy
*The ability to reinforce depleted troops with veterans or grunts

Cons
*Career mechanic is shallow 
*Needs an overlay map to provide more detailed descriptions of the battlefield
*Not enough variation in leveling up troops.  
*Troops can only be equipped with one type of weapon per regiment.  If you run out of that one type of weapon you can't recruit anymore troops into that regiment unless you change out tthe weapon.

Overall, Ultimate General: Civil War is a fantastic game, but is somewhat flawed by shallow mechanics.  It's a step forward from UG: Gettysburg concerning the actual battles you play, but the mechanics involved with the Base Camp need to be further fleshed out before release.

7/10

Game balance is terrible, even on easy difficulty the enemy got unlimited manpower and founds.
Every battle you'll be facing a huge enemy army, totaly crippling your army every battle, and if the AI feel like it they can just charge your army over and over since their troops don't seem to loose stamina running across the whole map and they even take less damage in an open field than your troops in 100% cover. And the manpower and founds gained after each battle is so low that you can't even replace the troops and equipment you loose. Until the power of the AI 
is balanced i don't recommend this game unless you like a hardcore challenge.

-Update
Recent updates fixed much of the balance issues, the enemy don't seem to have so much of an advantage anymore, also they take the same kind of damage as you do when at a disadvantage (routing/in rivers/open fields). Although they seem to still have a slight advantage when it comes to founds and available weapons in the armory but nowhere near like before.

So i'm going to change my recommendation to positive.

It recalls Civ War Gens 1 & 2, both in scope (covering the entire Civil Conflict), & in the severe unbalance in combat between the Computer and the Inhuman player.  In CWG 1 & 2, the imbalance is in the favor of the inhuman/player.

In UGCW, the opening campaign task of taking the Fort (playing as the Confederacy), is a case in point, with the imbalance against the player.  The Confeds, Gen Longstreet, Me, are asked to liberate a FORT - Without the helpful use of Artillery.  Additionally, the enemy has skirmishers stationed in blocking positions just on the other side of bridges that need to be crossed.  

The recent patch has apparently NOT sufficiently addressed the issue of BALANCE between the computer Army and the Player's Army.  Without balance, the game is not as much fun as it could be.  Now, for the armchair Militarists, there are choices provided of more difficult  levels of play to satisfy their bloodlust.  But for those of us who desire a more level playing field???

We (me & my alter evil), ask the providers, to kindly play the game - themselves, and see if they can take that fort.  If they can, might they provide us with a video of just how they accomplish that feat, on a level playing field (their 'level' playing field thay have provided for us).

Makes me feel like am right there or playing on the ultimate tabletop setup only a very rich minitures lover could afford. The ui controls and troop reactions are very fluid and natural. The morale effects are surreal making both sides of the war feel very alive as they are broken turning to flee until they have their wits about them again. Then there are things like exhaustion to deal with when charging too much or not letting one's army rest for a bit. 

Seeing the battlefield carnage gives a eerie sense of loss as corpses litter the now silent lonely landscape as both sides of the conflict have moved on to another area to continue their courageous battle for what each side believes is right.

The audio work is also fluid flowing perfectly with the action. It was a real rush hearing a bugle making the classic CHARGE! music as troops rushed into battle. Its been ages i have heard that in a game. The sound of canon/gunfire and soldiers battling is like stepping back in time to a past reality.

However there are still a few things that would improve the game overall:
1. Enemies and Allies will retreat through oppossing lines which makes no sense
2. Officers who are not Corps commanders have no noticeable impact, it would be interesting if Division/Brigade commanders could have traits or a greater battlefield presence.
3. In larger battles it is extremely difficult to tell the condition of your troops if you are not dirrectly controlling them.

It offers two major campaigns, with 13 major battles each, and 1-3 minor skirmishes per major battle. The campaigns are linear, meaning wether you win or lose, you will play the next battle anyway. However the number of men you have available and the amount of cash correlates with your performance in battle. 
Additionally in the main menu there are historical battles (covering the same engagements like in the campaign) and a small number of customized battles. On the battlefiield you have to conquer strategic points, this equals often in the destruction of the enemy army. There is no multiplayer yet, sadly.

Designing your armies is quite detailed, you can choose between 15 sorts of weapons for infantry (e.g.Springfield 1855, Palmetto 1841 etc.), and around the same number for each cavalry, artillery and skirmishers class. The weapons cost different amounts of money, depending on their performance like reload time, accuracy and range, to name some attributes. A limited number of weapons is being provisioned by your government as well, furthermore you get weapons from the battlefield debris. 
Also, you can either refill your ranks with inexperienced troops or veterans, the difference in the costs are massive.

Reading through the negative reviews on this game I have to say that the AI is very tough. Extremely tough. 
Although it is not impossible to win, and here my opinion differs from the recent reviews.

I play these type of games for many years and I always look for the challenge. Take the the Total War series for example, their games offer an extensive multiplayer community, but in single player the AI is just crap. Same goes for 95% of the other games out there, at a point you can manage. Here a veteran of strategy games will be tested thoroughly, over and over.

In general it is possible to survive the campaign with positive results, only it takes a lot of time of intensive planning and the willingness to repeat some battles - as in some cases despite
winning a major battle, your army took such a beating that the money for the victory does not cover your casualties.

At the moment they are improving the AI, making it more adaptive and at the same time designing the campaign more dynamic.

I hope they will add a multiplayer mode soon.",1496871385,1496871684,True,23,3,0.693041741847991943,0,True,False,True

I started as Union and the game so far is amazing. I've been looking for a Civil War game of this caliber for a long, long, time and I think I may have finally found it. After I make it through the campaign I'll give it an update but for an earl access game it seems to be all there as far as I can tell with my limited number of hours so far. If it continues to get support, updates, and added features like the develper is promising and has done so far then it's a no brainer. That is the tricky part about early access though, something can be going great one month and then nothing for another year so only time will tell. This does seem to have the potential to be the best Civil War game of all time though if given the attention it deserves so on that basis alone I would say to support the devs and buy it just in the hope that they do the right thing and have the ambition to go for it because if I as a player can tell that greatness exists in this title they certainly must be able to feel it themselves. I can only hope that all the pieces come together, if they do this is one of those games that will have thousands of hours of replayability so on that note.... Till next time. 

Edit: Right now the game is almost unplayable due to balancing issues. The opposing force whether Union or Rebel always has superior numbers and no matter how much man power you throw at them they come back full strength the very next battle while your army actually suffers from losses sustained throughout the campaign. This game has the potential to be amazing it just needs to be balanced or army size needs to be reduced to around the same number each battle but either way something needs to give right now it is just an excercise in futility.

Re-edit: 6/7/17  Latest patch seems to have fixed the balancing issue and adding much more in terms of features and replaybility. The devs actually listened to the constructive criticism and used the feedback to improve their game.

Control remains largely the same. You click and drag your mouse to draw a arrow to move your troops. The biggest changes come in some additional RPG elements. You can create your army by recruiting commanders and making divisions. You also can outfit them with various weapons. You have to be mindful of doing so however as there are political ramifications that can cause you to lose further support later on if your too liberal with spending money. It's a restriction that prevents you from just going whole hog and buying all the best units/weapons up front. This limitation makes your choices all the more important.

This game is simply a must in any strategy game fan's collection. Sid Meier's Gettysburg is often held in high esteem by many (myself included). But the Ultimate General games are fantastic and may just have edged out a venerable classic. This game comes with the highest praise I can give and earns a glowing recommendation.

The campaign part of the game is virtually complete.  However they may add more to the game itself or tweak the campaign. This game is well worth the price tag for the amount of time you will spend trying to win just one campaign.   The developers have done an amazing job improving on their previous game Ultimate General: Gettysburg and it shows through the challenging campaign, competent ai, and the tweaking you can do to make either side represent your play style.  You can build a cavalry corps, an artillery reserve divison, or just build up an entire army of infantry.  You can capture or purchase better weapons so that your army can have better accuracy or even rapid fire with breechloaders.  You can win Gettysburg in a flash only to watch your troops get ripped to pieces at Chickamauga.  All of it is possible in this game.

For those who loved the Ultimate General Gettysburg they vastely improved on the system.   They fixed the three main problems I had with the Gettysburg game (complicated artillery placement, no way to capture enemy troops, odd bonus stats for either side) while adding in bonuses for winning minor battles, improving your general's stats, and balancing victory against price (You can win a battle but if you lose more men then you gain it ultimately works against you).  If you are looking for a great combination of the old Sid Meier's civil war style combat and American Civil War Generals' campaign and unit building then this is the game for you.

Pros:
Easy to learn controls
Noticable changes in battle effectiveness due to weapons equipped and bonuses selected
Interesting campaign that allows players to build their own armies and leaders
Developing AI that, even in easy mode, can overtake you if you are not paying attention. 
Can capture units and artillery is not as finicky about placement
Accurate""ish"" major battles of the west and east  that offer different challenges for the player.
Great replayability. 

Cons: mainly just minor issues so far that may be dealt with as the game is completed
trying to select large groups can get difficult to do.
Nothing else!

What they could add:
A New Game + mode would be great.  This would allow you to start the campaign again with the army that you had after Richmond or DC 1865.  This could be nerfed with a limit on divisions allowed to fight in each battle.  Allows for greater replayability and would allow players to build up their armies instead of having to rebuild if they want to play the campaign again.

Possible Multiplayer system in which you can control armies or split the armies with teammates (1v1,2v2,3v3,). Each side has a certain amount of money and manpower to build a force and fight in one of the maps of the campaign.

Gettysburg day 2 for a Confederate successful day 1.  Gettysburg is pretty easy to win as the South as you only have to play day 1 if you decide not to be Ewell and take the heights.  It would be a nice add-on to have a second day where the Union troops try to push you off the heights.

Possible European intervention and blockade run:  As the confederates to put points towards blockade runners for more weapons and money. If the campaign goes well maybe even increase available manpower or offer some British or French units that can be put into the army.

Possible Naval expansion or DLC:  Add a naval campaign where both sides fight over the rivers and ports of the Confederacy.  Or allow greater use of ships in the main campaign for certain battles.    

Finally I would love to see Ultimate General do a Napoleon or 1800s European game.  This has nothing to do with the current game but I believe their system is amazing would mesh well with those two time periods.  This may not even be on the horizon for them but I hope they do consider it.

I've been following Darth since his modding days, and when he moved to game design i thought.. this is going to be awesome. Gettysburg was a fun game, so i had extremely high hopes for this.

Unfortunately it did not take long to find out that he had gone the lazy route and just autoscaled everything, which was a gigantic disappointement. Autoscaling makes whatever you do completely irrelevant. It completely kills all progression elements in the game, and their only function now is that you have to take them to not fall even further behind what is a default computer setup.

To explain in-depth what i mean... the computer auto-scales to your army. But it has a ""minimum level"" of gear it will not go below, so it could for example mean that in battle 3, it will never have worse equipment than ""Rifle 2"", in battle 5, ""Rifle 3"", and so on.

The problem is that it doesn't end there. If you are ABOVE the minimum level of gear (say that you have managed to trade and hawk and steal and using whatever method to get a unit with ""Rifle 4""... well.. now you are going to meet an enemy unit that is 1.5 times bigger than yours with those same rifles due to the auto-scaler.  Which means that the only point in equipping your troops is to not further gimp yourself.. you can never get ahead.

This is not a game. This is the proverbial ""here is a wall, go bang your head against it"". And when you've knocked it down, proceed to the next wall, which will be stronger.

Normally I'm not into Civil War games because of the discomfort factor of dealing with that whole era in general, but I'll be damned if this isn't one of the most satisfying strategy experiences I've ever had that easily rival the likes of Total War and Supreme Commander; in tactical depth, fun factor and the ease with which you can pick up and play the game within minutes of purchasing it, Ultimate General: Civil War satisfies on all fronts.

The style is very interesting; it looks very pretty without a polygon in sight. The 2D graphics are very sharp and very appropriate, with the tens of thousands of troops that will need to be rendered on-screen at once to perfectly recreate historical battles like you've never seen before. The terrain is rich and colorful and the many units under your command contrast quite nicely with the backdrop, making tracking your forces a breeze. The sound effects are also top-notch. Maybe could use a little more variety with the sound effects but I only say this because I know I'm going to be putting many many hours into this game.

After playing this, I wonder why every RTS doesn't let you hold and drag the mouse button to instantly lay out precise paths for your troops to follow. I never played Gettysburg, this game's predecessor, but for all I know, there's a few mechanics introduced here that feel both essential in this title and sorely missed in ones to follow, a feeling I haven't had since Blizzard revolutionized the genre with Warcraft and later Starcraft back in the 90s. For the most part the gameplay works very well. Sometimes I just want to make a slight adjustment to a column's positioning and instead they spend a good ten to fifteen seconds rotating around, pushing other columns out of the way and taking unnecessary flanking damage, but USUALLY they behave if you learn to play the game and manage your forces properly, which in the game's early state is pretty applaudable. There seems to be a LOT of talent at work here with just about every aspect of the game.

There are a few different game types and you can even create your own battles if you like. I usually stick to the big, awesome, famous historical battles with troops all ready to go and backstory presented with each one. The campaign is a little impenetrable for the casual player. If you like the thought of managing your funds and making sure all of your troops have the best possible muskets you can afford and are adequately trained and supplied as you try and scrape by with leftovers from previous battles as you scramble not to let your new recruits die before you can afford to give them something better than rocks and their daddy's pellet gun they brought with them, you will get a big nerd stiffy over the campaign, but I am a man of simpler tastes.

Overall, I can't wait til the game's release and picked it up when I heard the price will likely increase after early access because it looked so good I didn't want to wait for a sale that could be many months down the road. The game's pretty much done anyway and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot if you are any kind of RTS fan.",1496076711,1496076711,True,0,0,0.488372087478637695,0,True,False,True

At the moment that's all it is, potential.

As you play battle to battle the AI has infinite manpower and matches whatever you throw out. So keeping your army smaller actually makes the game a bit easier the way the AI works. This is an EA review near completion, but I expect within the next patch or two the game will launch and maybe this will be fixed.

Seriously, this game is so finely polished, it has never felt like an early-access title.  What the developers have given us here is a game that has unique mechanics that are probably the best and most realistic out there (Total War get out) for any battlefield tactics game that represents this period.  The battles FEEL alive, desperate, huge, and epic.  I find myself getting so sucked into the experience that I lose all sense of time.  The journey of going through the war with your three corps, appointing commanders, leveling up brigades, and fighting through each battle is a unique experience.  I have no qualms whatsoever with the quality of this game.  Do beware, this game has a steep learning curve when it comes to the difficulty.  This game does NOT hold your hand, and to get good at this game, you're gonna need to study what you did wrong, and think about different strategies when you inevitably lose your first battle.  

The only thing I think this game could use a little more work on is the thematic material.  The gameplay mechanics are SOLID.  What I need now is to feel immersed in the time period- give me period music (the music, though sparse, is quite good, however); I want to hear the classic tunes from the Civil War like Battlecry of Freedom, Dixie, Bonnie Blue Flag, Battle Hymn of the Republic, etc.  I also think it would be cool if all of the units of either side weren't one solid color.  Make the Union forces different hues of blue, or throw in some Zouaves for some kind of variance.  For the Confederates, make their uniforms a mish-mash of grey and homespun colors to show the rough-and-ready characteristic of their military uniforms. Also, perhaps adding regimental/brigade flags, that show what battles each of them have fought in would be neat.  It would just be a cool thematic addon that would be icing on the cake at this point.

It was July 21, 1861, a brand new commander has risen through the ranks after defeating many small detachments of Federal forces. The Confederate government in Richmond sent him to assist P. G. T. Beauregard at the Manassas Junction aftering hearing reports of Federal Movements that crossed the Potomac and headed his way. Beauregard was not expecting the Federals to hit his left flank so  he gave the commander 2 Brigades of Infantry, 1 Brigade of Cavalry and 1 battery. He was ordered to hold the stone bridge against any force that might oppose him. While waiting for the imminent attack, the commander heard rumors of Federals trying to get around his extreme left flank and he ordered his only brigade of cavalry to head towards Matthew's Hill. Soon as the cavalry galloped off into the distance hills. He could hear thousands pairs of boots hitting the ground in the distance. Then, after waiting all morning, the attack finally came, starting off with cannon shots. He ordered one of his infantry brigades to a defensive barrier right above the stone bridge, which gave enough cover for the men to reload and shoot upon the incoming Federals. He ordered the other infantry Brigade to head up river to a patch of trees because there were more rumors of a flanking maneuver by the Federals up river. Lucky his brigade caught the Federals in the open and cut them to pieces, forcing them back. His battery was firing away at the incoming Federals, doing maximum damage to the expose columns. The commander thought that everything was under control until he heard of a new infantry column headed his way. The commander knew if he was attack Beauregard would send reinforcements but none has came yet. He also knew that Johnston was in Winchester and he would come if Beauregard would be attacked. But finally help came, it was Hampton's Legion, the commander ordered Hampton to run towards Matthew's Hill because the hill is a stragetic ground to hold. The cavalry he sent towards Matthew's Hill sent a runner relaying information about movements towards the north, a Federal column looking to capture Matthew's Hill. Lucky Hampton's Legion made it to the House before the Federals did and entrenched themselves for the impending attack. But the Federals that were headed towards the Matthew's Hill were bigger than expected and forced Hampton's Legion back. At the same time, his right flank was about to be overrun by the large infantry column supported by battries. He knew he had to retreat or they would be overrun. So the commander sent runners to all brigades to fall back towards Herny House Hill, a key strategic location where the commander could consolidate his forces and form a line against the Federal onslaught. The brigade he sent up river had to form a line to hold off the Federal cavalry that was trying to get near his only battery and supply wagon. Hampton's legion ran as fast as they could to escape the Federal push towards Matthew's Hill. The cavalry detachment made it back and was escorting the artillery across a shallow stream just north of Henry House Hill. With all of his forces in retreat, it was looking bleak for the commander but then he saw Beauregard himself with fresh troops who were able to form a defensive bulge agaisnt the Federal's attack. But it seemed like the Federals were growing stronger every minute. Fresh Federal brigades were pouring into the open, it seemed like there was no way he could stop this force from over running his position on Henry House Hill. But with a strike of luck, Thomas J Jackson arrived with his regiments of Virginians, who were able to plug any gap in the line. Even though his men were in good defensive position, they were slowing being killed off by combined artillery and rifle fire. The commander ordered his all the batteries he had at disposal and sent them close enough to the Federal line to shower them with grape shot. This was working, giant holes were being ripped open thanks to the precise shots of his cannons. But still, it seemed like if one Federal was shot down, another would take his place. Federals attempted many charges on his left flank but all where repulsed. The Federals were pushing farther and farther forcing his lines back. The only hope the commander had left was in the hands of Johnston who had to be close. If Johnston couldn't arrive in time, the commander would be forced off the field and give victory to the Federals. Most of his brigades were spent, they were losing more men than they could sustain. It seemed like victory was lost. But in the distance, there was a rebel flag waving with thousands of fresh troops behind it arriving in Manassas Junction. It was Johnston and his army, The commander order Johnston and his men to hit the Federal right flank, most of these yanks have been fighting since their first attack on Matthew's Hill and were tired. They couldnt hold against fresh troops and Johnston's attack forced them to run for their lives. With the Federal right flank collapsing. All brigades that were free, pushed against the Federal center and left flank. These Federals could not resist this counter attack and they fled in dispair like their comrades on the right flank. The commander was able to reclaim all of the land he lost since the beginning of the battle, the federals were on the run leaving many rifles and cannons in the dust, allowing them to be captured by the pursing Confederates. This was a stunning victory for the confederates and the commander, it showed that this man would be on a road to establish the Confederate States of America, free from the tyranny of the north. All across the southern states, cities and towns blew up with celebration, this battle looked like it would be a devastating defeat for the south but was turned around and turned out to be a decisive victory instead.

A big complaint I'm seeing is that the game is too hard.  I find this to be a mild exageration.  While it certainly isn't a casual game.  I think anyone with decent experience with real time strategy games will have no problem beating this on Normal difficulty.  The AI does a lot of stupid things.  Generally they don't react to what you do, and this can be easily exploited.  Start a mission, see what the AI is going to do.. then restart and counter it.  Well that's what you can do if you want to be unsportsmanlike and just crush them.  Actually you can continue after you lose a battle, that's right, you don't have to win to move on.  So to sum up this first point... get gud scrub.

Next complaint is that no matter how well you do you don't make the next battle easier, or change the results.  This is a strange complaint.  This isn't total war.

Each battle should be viewed as an independant mission like from an RTS like Starcraft, again not like total war.  You cannot change the results of the war, what happened happened.

Let us be brief

Pros
1)The game follows a more realistic approach of army hierarchy. No more General and one army. Every division has its own captain, and you are the one who will judge which captain will comandeer it. Choose wisely
2)Captains die or get wounded. Its a war isn't it?
3)Every division has a battle record and can also get battle hardened
4) Every division gets upgraded with better weapons
5)Forget Total War's battle tactics. Here you need to use real tactics. Protect that hill. Scout that forest. Choose your moves wisely or you will regret it. The terrain plays a vital role as well.
6)Along with the major battles, there are also minor battles, and when you win them, you get the upper hand in the major ones. 
7)Enemy AI. You will see the enemy, you will think you will know its tactic, and out of nowere, the enemy will defeat you. Why? Because there was something you missed.


Cons
1) You do not play General Lee. You play yourself. You can also recruit Lee. I could be mistaken
2) Although the battles keep the historical tactics, you cannot create your own. For example, in Fredericksburg, if you play the CSA, you will always have the bridges destroyed, you will always harass the union from building pontoon bridges, and you will always wait for them uphill. You cannot create new outcomes like the ones in the previous game Gettysburg. Then again. I haven't play them all

If you're looking for a Total War type game it's close. Control large armies consisting of infantry, calavry, skirmishers and artillery. March off to reap great rewards and anihilate enemy armies.  But here's the rub. It isn't as easy as Total War. Please don't misunderstand. I love the Total War franchise and enjoy conquering countries but in UG:Civil War the AI is unbelieveably smart. So smart that even on ""Easy"" (Colonel mode AND with fixed enemy troop sizes) you can get your head served up on a platter in no time.

I won't bore you with my gameplay. I'm still learning. I've completed the first battle you're assigned for the Union and after a few tries got a grip on it. Or so I thought. Made it to the third battle (First Bull Run) as the Confederacy and I was surprsied I managed that, You'll cringe at casulaty rates for both you and your opponet but Civil War battles usually had 20% to sometimes as high as 37% losses. expect that here.  Wiping out the enemy to only a few soldiers is impossible. It's a wearing down process.

If you read some of the comments by other players on the forum you'll find plenty of information on strategy, re-equipping troops, tactics and the like there. I also suggest watching a couple of Youtube videos is worth your while. You'll get a good idea of what you'll be up against.

Take my word for it when I tell you I haven't even scratched the surface of this game by playing it or even describing it to you. lots of management stuff to apply to increase your troop's effectiveness and your own prestige as the Senior Commander of a Corps (many more later) of a portion of the Union or Confederate Armies.

The game seemed to accept that but on Shiloh for example, it forced me as the Union to fall back to Pittsburgh Landing and counter attack even though I had crushed the rebel army, they had less than 5 thousand troops left.

""I want to recommend this game because I have enjoyed the time I put into it but I can't, at least right now. 

1) The scripting of the battles and the larger campaign leaves a lot to be desired. For instance, at Shiloh as the Union, I held the CSA at the first battle line. The game then said ""fall back to this line"" and I said ""rather not, doing fine here."" It keep telling me to fall back. I killed all but ~800 of the CSA army. Day 2 starts and I have an army of 25,000 facing their 800 - but I've bet set back to the edge of the map at Pittsburg Landing. Why? Also why did the AI engage on the second day? 

2) The larger campaign has these same problems. I was playing the the series of battles in the Peninsula Campaign as the Union and won each one by huge margins. And the next battle would load - a holding action to cover our retreat. Why are we retreating? I've inflicted massive losses on the AI but am retreating because that is what historically happened? 

This leads to a cognitive dissonance. I have control over the units on the battle but what the units do doesn't matter because the next events are all pre-scripted and rigid. 

If we allow the player to deviate from history in the battles (e.g., by winning or inflicting massive losses in an ahistorical way), it doesn't make sense to have the next battles be bounded by history. A battle, like Gettysburg, happened because of what happened at Chancellorsville. Having Gettysburg occur in a reasonably historically accurate way after a union win at Chancellorsville just doesn't make sense. 

Without a branching or dynamic campaign, it feels pointless to win/lose/draw the battles. 

3) The scaling. I understand the importance of the scaling to keep the game challenging but it needs some sanity bounds. If I inflict near-complete losses on the AIs army, they need to start the next battle with similarly low solider counts. The soliders could be better under the hood (harder to kill, better shots under the reasoning that some of those who survived did so for a reason) but to inflict 80% losses and then see the army with near 100% or more than 100% recovery at the next battle just doesn't work. 

4) Broken mechanics, specifically the AI's ability to run everywhere and do endless melee. Also the endless melee. It seems to have gotten worse. I recently watched a battle as the AI charged my lines. The targeted unit had a 2 to 1 or more advantage over the AI in troops, was totally rested and had 100% morale. There was no attempt to soften the target with rifle or cannon fire - just a charge. The AI unit was routed and it retreated about 300 yards, regrouped and then came back and repeated the charging process. 

Elsewhere on the battlefield, an AI unit charged an approximately evenly matched unit, again totally rested and ready to fight. The AI did this charge up a river bluff and without any other prior engagement. They just saw my unit on the top of the hill and went for it. They had 2 batteries of arty that could have been deployed and another unit or two that they could used to provide some fire or attempted a flanking move. Nope. They just went for a headlong frontal assault. Which failed, lead to a rapid regroup, repeat and eventual sucess. 

Basically, once the AI sees a unit, it charges. There seems to be no regard for the unit's relative strengths or the tactical situation. 

This is a larger problem because the AI can charge over near-infinite distances and doesn't suffer issues with dropping condition in melee/movement/battle (at least as far as I can see). Melee itself is broken (sticky melee is the bane of my playtime). The AI also doesn't have the persistance that your army does - high losses are okay because they are reset as soon as the battle is over. So there is no reason for the AI to not meat-grinder its units into your lines. 

This just results in tactically uninteresting battles. ""Oh, there is the Rebel corps I was looking for - they are running across 2 miles of open ground in a charge for my center. Despite being outnumbered 3 to 1 and me having a strong position."" 

5) ""Magic hill syndrome."" The game has this by the truck load. The reason the hills became important on a field was because of the actions taken by the armies on the field. Suppose for some reason that Meade had set his line far to the east of Gettysburg and Lee had choosen to attack him there. Would Little Round Top have mattered? No. The hills and strong points became important in the tactical context of the battle - otherwise they are just as unimportant as the hill down the road from your house. 

But that isn't how the game treats the hills. You absolutely must hold certain points on the battlefield because they were tactically important in the historical battle - regardless of their importance in your current battle. Kill and rout the AI but fail to capture the magic hill in time? Draw or defeat are your only options.

The AI is aware of these magic hills. I was playing Antietam and pushed the CSA back to the limits of the town of Sharpsburg. Both of our armies were very beat up. The only points on the battle that mattered tactically were where we were fighting to the NE of Sharpsburg. I'm getting ready to do a slight flanking move with my cav and notice the AI is marching a unit towards the VP at Dunker Church. That point has no value - the AI is about to have several units encircled to the NE of town and the first few blocks of Sharpsburg. But the AI is like ""hey, Dunker Church is undefended and historically important, so we should capture that. The actual tactical situtation on the ground is irrelevant."" 

Eventually, every playthrough, I lose interest. Why spend this hour fighting this battle if the result doesn't matter when it comes to the battle I fight next? Or the army I face next? Or how well I fight doesn't matter as much as if I can send a unit on an end-run march to capture and hold some historically important (but not important in the context) point on the map?

Hopefully some patch comes out that fixes the melee, fixes the endless charging and maybe someday a branching campaign mode. Because it certainly does not ""fully depend on player actions and battle results"" right now. It is almost fully independent of player actions and results. If that happens, I'll be excited to revise this review and put as many hours as I can spare into the battles.""",1482376774,1491516752,False,0,0,0.502183854579925537,2,True,False,True

You could lose a battle or 2 but still play on in the campaign ( with reduced men and supplies ) which i found very realistic, afterall, whoever won every battle in a war? My favourite ACW game now is this game. Why? Mainly because of the way the campaign plays. You win some battles, draw some battles and yes, lose some battles, but guess what, the war continues just like real life. I personaly hate games where you HAVE TO WIN every battle/mission to proceed to the next one. Hats off to Game-Labs for implementing this aspect to the campaign. Theyve obviously read about dunkirk, operation market garden and many other real examples of major defeats in battle, but who managed to turn things around and win a war.
 I love the movement of units, their strenght and weaknesses, the way you can upgrade the brigades/divisions/corps and get promotions for your officers. When you lose a great unit/Officer, there is a real sense of loss. The battle maps are fantasticaly realised and look great and have a great number of ways to exploit them with hidden movement behind hills or in small woods/forests or through a farms wheat fields. Even the smoke from the musket fire looks good and can obscure movement in big battles. I have only played 30ish hours but so far have thoroughly enjoyed the experience and can only hope the the rest of the game will be finished.This is how to do an early access game.

To make the game more challenging, when you get more experience, troops and better weapons, the AI also get them proportionally (scaling).  The problem is the system lacks transparency. The player should know how much troops he is allowed to have before scaling gets under way. Also scaling should be based on the troops your send in one specific battle, not in your entire army. That would be really interesting if scaling was included in the difficulty level setting so each player could customize it to his liking. The ideal would be three sliders for troops, weapons, experience.

As for now, you are punished for building a better army as the so-called campaign progress. Which gets me to another problem, even if you win consistently battle after battle and kill tens of thousands of foes, the AI gets stronger, so it's not really a ""campaign"". You get no reward other than better troops and weapons, but as the AI also gets them anyway (because of scaling), that is not a real reward. I do understand that is intended to keep the game challenging, but that breaks immersion and some sense of fulfillment. So a balance must be found to make the game both immersive and challenging.

Visible bonuses for brigade and division commanders would be nice. Now they can command more troops efficiently, but that is not clearly visible, only corps commander have bonusess you can choose. Special bonuses available only for historical commanders would also be great.

Also, there are still balancing issues, notably for guns (cannons), skirmishers (including cavalry).

A special dislike mention for the Rio Hill battle, battles that you cannot win without (unhistorical) gamey tactics are not challenging, they are highly annoying.

The good news is the game is already quite good and we are still in early access. So we may hope most of these problem will be adressed and, at least partly, solved.",1488078532,1491240561,True,0,0,0.516301155090332031,1,True,False,True

This game is pretty darn good.  For a civil war simulator it is the best I have experienced and it is still in early access. There are a number of features that make this game great, but there are also a number of features in the game that can still use some work. The flaws of this game aren't game breaking, but if you're a stickler for immersive gaming you may find them annoying. The game is easy to learn and hard to master, which is essential to a good strategy game, but many of the ""hard to master"" components of the game are actually weird gameplay flaws that you have to learn to work around.

There are a ton of great things about this game. Cavalry is done really well. Unit experience is interesting and flexible. Casualities and recruiting is solid.  The battles, weapons, and leaders are all historically accurate. Battles are tactically challenging and varied.  The UI is easy to understand and the graphics are clear and pleasing. You feel very protective and invested in your army.  I highly recommend the game overall but since I enjoy the game so much I think my time is best spent on the areas that need improvement.

Flaws:

Unit spin

When adjusting a unit's position a small amount on the battlefield to, for instance, get better cover, they tend to do a 180 or 360 spin that exposes their flanks and rear. When enemy units are nearby they can rout your unit simply because you tried to adjust a position slightly.  Eventually you learn to not adjust positions near enemies, but it limits gameplay and breaks immersion when you can't instruct a unit to move 10 feet to the right without them doing a square dance.

Units don't fire

Often times during battles my infantry units won't fire. Upon giving the unit a move order the unit will fire it's volley at the enemy and then move. Indicating that your non-firing unit was indeed within range. It is most frustrating when you notice a unit is not firing, so you give it a move command to get it within range. It then fires a volley at the enemy, moves closer, stops moving and then doesn't fire because it still thinks it is out of range of the enemy. The better weapons in the game have longer ranges and it's incredibly frustrusting to have spent tons of money on expensive weapons with a range advantage and then have them not use the range advantage on the enemy.

Skrimisher commands

Skrimishers only fire at enemy units when you give them individual firing commands. Sharpshooter units are skirmishers so they only fire when given specific commands. It creates a level of micromanagement that is too intensive for the scale of the battles involved, essentially making the units useless in large engagements. They just sit there with tons of enemy units in range and don't fire until given a command.

Artillery is Underpowered

They are essentially in the game to give enemy units a morale debuff.  They don't inflict enough casualties in the game to make a significant difference on the battlefield so it is difficult to justify their supply requirements and unit slot use in comparison to infantry or cavalry units. This is especially significant in small engagements where you are unit limited. This also breaks immersion because historically artillery could be devastating.

Cover is far too powerful (needs entrenching mechanic)

I win battles in this game by finding 90%+ cover areas and parking my units there. There needs to be more tactical depth to cover use in the game. Cover needs to be slightly less powerful and an entreching mechanic needs to be instituted so that only stationary units can gain the 100% cover benefit and deep forest needs higher movement penalties.

Overly scripted battles:

When playing as CSA in the battle of Antietam, I drove the first wave of Union troops off the map.  The next wave then magically spawned on top of my troops flanking and immediately entering melee with my sharpshooter units.  I was punished for being too good at the game. I had to then change my gameplay to be purposely worse at the game and not occupy the enemy positions that I had just routed them from. The battle of Fredericksburg (as the Union this time) has a weird split in the middle of the battle that artificially keeps many thousands of your troops from fully engaging the enemy on an open flank. Both issues you can adjust for, but it breaks immersion and punishes you for success instead of rewarding you.

Army Scaling:

Each battle is scaled to adjust to your army size to have a historically matched force.  This gameplay mechanic is meant to allow each battle to be more historical, tactical, and allow you to a have a fighting chance to win if you're not doing very well and suffered many casualities. Unfortunately, if you win battles and you are doing well this mechanic also punishes you in a very non-immersive way, by allowing a decimated opponent to magically have many thousands more troops for the next battle even though you routed the entire enemy army in the prior engagement.  This breaks immersion, but it also allows you to keep playing the game, since once you start winning the war, if you kept immersion, you would essentially win the civil war early and the game would end early in your victory. I think this is going to be a tough mechanic for the developers to iron out. I personally try avoid this issue by purposely keeping my army small to keep enemy unit size and army size small. 

The developers have tried to straddle the historical/tactical and strategic gameplay realms and it creates this weird combination of both that just doesn't quite work. To solve the issue, If they went for full strategic gameplay, then you would need a campaign map, resources, map movement, battle location choice and the current historical battles wouldn't be used at all or sparingly. If you went fully historical you would have only historical battles and you wouldn't have a strategic gameplay component that gets you emotionally invested in your units. Historical battles are currently included in the game.  

The solution to this problem is to have an intelligent branching battle system similar to the one implemented in Ultimate General: Gettysburg (UG:G).  Establishing a system like (UG:G) would be very difficult and time consuming since the scope of (UG:CW) is exponentially larger than (UG:G).  Also, this solution creates a seperate bigger problem. Experienced players will defeat the AI too easily and lead to early victories. To overcome an early victory problem the developers would need to either increase enemy troop counts, which would break immersion, and give you the same problem you were trying to fix, or make a more intelligent AI to increase difficulty. Again, creating a more intelligent AI is very difficult, and if they could pull it off would essentially make Game-Labs one of the best game developers on the planet.

To sum up the army scaling issue, right now the best thing that Game-Labs could do is make prior battles have more enemy army size scaling in response to casualities and equipment losses. That would be in the up to 20% size reduction range, currently it's in the 2.5 - 5% range. Also, they could create a retreat mechanic that triggers at a high casuality number like 40%. This would maintain immersion and not allow my army to kill almost the entirety of a 20,000 man army and then supposedly fight the same 20,000 man army the next week at full strength. Then they could back-burner a battle braching system and AI updates for a DLC at a later date.",1488066933,1490997168,True,13,1,0.631519138813018799,3,True,False,True

However, notice how I wrote ""in the making."" As the game is in early access, there is a good amount of bugs and tweaking that needs to go on. Units set to ""hold"" will often disregard that order if they are charged by an enemy, which makes holding defensive positions, and keeping your lines in order nearly impossible. This will also lead to routing units, and thousands of unnecessary deaths. ""Tired"" units(who have been under hours of gunfire and lost hundreds of men) will sometimes beat ""fresh"" units in melee combat. The campaign needs to be more dynamic than it is, as the AI just instantly refills its army, while the player struggles to get extra men from their capital. Etc. Those are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to game tweaks that need to be fixed.

1) Scaling mechanic ensures that no matter what kind of army you build, and no matter what year of the war you are in, the enemy always has equal or more troops of higher quality with better weapons than you.

2) Dynamic campaign is NOT dynamic.  Its just a series of major battles (with optional battles you can fight beforehand, or just skip) in the exact same linear chain every time you play.  The optional battles (if you win) can net you tiny modifiers, which are completely negated by the scaling mechanic.

3) No multiplayer.  No co-op, no head-to-head.  Not going to happen.  Which means the ""campaign"" gets stale quick.  You can play the set-piece historical battles though...but thats a $20 game, not a $30 one.

Bugs everywhere:

1) Skirmishers that can outrun cavalry

2) Supply wagons that can outrun cavalry

3) In-game bug reporter that fails to send the report to the developer, then deletes the report so you can't attempt to send it again!  But it tells you it failed...sigh.

4) Insane morale bonuses for enemy troops making their brigades unbreakable.  Enemy units can lose 90% of their men without shattering.  Can you say ""bullet sponge""?

5) Insane charge mechanics where enemy units 1/3rd the size of your brigade will charge you and NOT break.  Good chance your unit will break though!

6) This one really chaps my hide:  Your reinforcements fail to appear on the battlefield.  You selected 2 corps with 3 divisions each, with 5 brigades per division at the battle setup?  Watch in horror as ENTIRE divisions fail to appear during reinforcement phases right through to the end of the battle.  See individual brigades never join their division, because the game decided ""nah, you don't need those units"".  Watch as you lose the battle (and probably the war) because you don't have the troops to complete your attack!

This game could use another 8 months of design, SERIOUS testing, and bug fixing.

NOT RECOMMENDED for purchase.

Game makes you really think like a military man, not a gamer, i.e. does this action make military sense? Marching through swamps, forests and hills, fighting enemy skirmishers all the way through, and fighting the enemy main force on the other side is going to take a physical toll on men carrying heavy equipment and arms. They will be able to do their job, but they are not ironmen. ""What can a soldier do who charges when out of breath?."" 
A lot of let's players I've watched tend to ignore condition, and seldom, if ever, give their regiments breathers. Mistake! Portrayed are regular men from around Virginia, Georgia and Carolina - not special forces, the tactics involve masses of infantry exchanging salvos, hoping the enemy will break first. Using Carolinean tactics, volley followed by a charge, can be effective. This will drain condition, however, and is always a risky prospect. 
You can flank the enemy, use stratagems and so on, but being good with meat grinder tactics, making sound moves with slow moving columns of infantry, so that you'll have fresh troops in a place that matters - these, I've found, work best. Scouting, skirmishing and flanking are all important as well. If you're familiar with any of the darthmods for Total War games, you'll know what I mean. You will take losses, you will make bad moves, which will cost you. It takes serious skill and some luck to win a clean victory, á la Robert E. Lee. Play on normal or hard for the best experience, when a bloody draw can be solid gold on strategic terms. 

Important, also, is army organisation and managing equipment and supply. Have a full brigade of 2000 men lead by a captain and his staff? No good, hire a proper brigadier for that, or get one from Richmond or Washington via political influence. Line regiments still armed with smoothbores from the 1840s? Go shopping, or use salvaged gear from the battle before. Had it bad at Shiloh? Manage raw recruits and veterans in order to balance experience loss via newbies, with the monetary cost of getting veterans. Regiment size, alone, decides nothing: organization and equipment, and in battle, support and positioning, do. Naming corps and regiments is also useful, as it is easier to keep track of your men if the unit has a unique moniker. Management in Ultimate General never feels like pointless micro management IMO, and being good at it can outright win battles. 

There's a fair bit of negatives to the game, most of them not that apparent after only 7 hours, and others have pointed these out, scaling, decisive victories having little effect for the next battle etc. What I personally would like to see, is a button which orders your troops to take the quickest route to target, especially artillery and supply wagons. These tend to get stuck into bogs and woods, and move extremely slowly, if ordered to move with the rest of the army, and ordering them, one by one, to follow a road is a bit of a chore. With strict time limits for battles, speed is essential, so there's that. Also, I find the range indicator cones, for artillery especially, to be of poor visibility, unless of course, I'm missing something. 
Also, I'm a bit confused about artillery - a solid battery of, say, 16 Napoleon 12pdr guns, seems to be seriously ineffective. Is it the positioning? Range? Enemy in cover? Am I supposed to be firing round shots from the flanks in order for them to go through as many infantrymen as possible? Despite the angle, I seem to be picking off far too few infantry per shot. Artillery could use a buff, or even better, mechanics for positioning and firing angles to make the game even more true to history. 
Game could also use a better tutorial, from what I've gathered there's only advisor boxes? If I knew nothing of Civil War battles and had no experience with Total War, I'd be confused. 
But other than that, I've had fun. It's a tough, pretty realistic game that rewards careful planning, scouting and movement. Worth 28€, I think, especially for fans of military history.",1489062809,1490177909,True,5,0,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,True

Very happy with the gameplay, but I hope  we are able to see some alternate battles when history is changed. I understand that the game is set up to play each battle as an independent campaign, and its nice that additions to the army stack over time, but I don't think I ought to have to fight Gettysburg after winning Sharpsburg, or Chickamauga after winning at Shiloh. As a matter of fact, I didn't lose a single major battle. 

I'd also like to see the enemy army take reputation damage and carry casualties inflicted. Maybe even have seperate armies in the Eastern/Western Theatres so that I can't use my elites in the defense of Jackson for instance. 

I only bring up expanding the game because this is single handedly the best Civil War game I have ever played, and I've played them all since ""Shiloh"" on my PC Junior. I absolutely love this game.

PRO:
-I like the system for upgrading the army and its abilities. No problem with the way the points are earned or spent.
-The graphics are sufficient and the gameplay is smooth.
-The battlefields are nicely done, and seem pretty accurate to my knowledge.
-No problem with the way that battles are scened out. I won Gettysburg on the first day through elite infantry charges.
CON:
-I want more, but only because whats done is great!
-I'm terrible with cavalry, so Brandy was a nightmare.

1) The scripting of the battles and the larger campaign leaves a lot to be desired. For instance, at Shiloh as the Union, I held the CSA at the first battle line. The game then said ""fall back to this line"" and I said ""rather not, doing fine here."" It keep telling me to fall back. I killed all but ~800 of the CSA army. Day 2 starts and I have an army of 25,000 facing their 800 - but I've bet set back to the edge of the map at Pittsburg Landing. Why? Also why did the AI engage on the second day? 

2) The larger campaign has these same problems. I was playing the the series of battles in the Peninsula Campaign as the Union and won each one by huge margins. And the next battle would load - a holding action to cover our retreat. Why are we retreating? I've inflicted massive losses on the AI but am retreating because that is what historically happened? 

This leads to a cognitive dissonance. I have control over the units on the battle but what the units do doesn't matter because the next events are all pre-scripted and rigid. 

If we allow the player to deviate from history in the battles (e.g., by winning or inflicting massive losses in an ahistorical way), it doesn't make sense to have the next battles be bounded by history. A battle, like Gettysburg, happened because of what happened at Chancellorsville. Having Gettysburg occur in a reasonably historically accurate way after a union win at Chancellorsville just doesn't make sense. 

Without a branching or dynamic campaign, it feels pointless to win/lose/draw the battles. 

3) The scaling. I understand the importance of the scaling to keep the game challenging but it needs some sanity bounds. If I inflict near-complete losses on the AIs army, they need to start the next battle with similarly low solider counts. The soliders could be better under the hood (harder to kill, better shots under the reasoning that some of those who survived did so for a reason) but to inflict 80% losses and then see the army with near 100% or more than 100% recovery at the next battle just doesn't work. 

4) Broken mechanics, specifically the AI's ability to run everywhere and do endless melee. Also the endless melee. It seems to have gotten worse. I recently watched a battle as the AI charged my lines. The targeted unit had a 2 to 1 or more advantage over the AI in troops, was totally rested and had 100% morale. There was no attempt to soften the target with rifle or cannon fire - just a charge. The AI unit was routed and it retreated about 300 yards, regrouped and then came back and repeated the charging process. 

Elsewhere on the battlefield, an AI unit charged an approximately evenly matched unit, again totally rested and ready to fight. The AI did this charge up a river bluff and without any other prior engagement. They just saw my unit on the top of the hill and went for it. They had 2 batteries of arty that could have been deployed and another unit or two that they could  used to provide some fire or attempted a flanking move. Nope. They just went for a headlong frontal assault. Which failed, lead to a rapid regroup, repeat and eventual sucess. 

Basically, once the AI sees a unit, it charges. There seems to be no regard for the unit's relative strengths or the tactical situation. 

This is a larger problem because the AI can charge over near-infinite distances and doesn't suffer issues with dropping condition in melee/movement/battle (at least as far as I can see). Melee itself is broken (sticky melee is the bane of my playtime). The AI also doesn't have the persistance that your army does - high losses are okay because they are reset as soon as the battle is over. So there is no reason for the AI to not meat-grinder its units into your lines. 

This just results in tactically uninteresting battles. ""Oh, there is the Rebel corps I was looking for - they are running across 2 miles of open ground in a charge for my center. Despite being outnumbered 3 to 1 and me having a strong position."" 

5) ""Magic hill syndrome."" The game has this by the truck load. The reason the hills became important on a field was because of the actions taken by the armies on the field. Suppose for some reason that Meade had set his line far to the east of Gettysburg and Lee had choosen to attack him there. Would Little Round Top have mattered? No. The hills and strong points became important in the tactical context of the battle - otherwise they are just as unimportant as the hill down the road from your house. 

But that isn't how the game treats the hills. You absolutely must hold certain points on the battlefield because they were tactically important in the historical battle - regardless of their importance in your current battle. Kill and rout the AI but fail to capture the magic hill in time? Draw or defeat are your only options.

The AI is aware of these magic hills. I was playing Antietam and pushed the CSA back to the limits of the town of Sharpsburg. Both of our armies were very beat up. The only points on the battle that mattered tactically were where we were fighting to the NE of Sharpsburg. I'm getting ready to do a slight flanking move with my cav and notice the AI is marching a unit towards the VP at Dunker Church. That point has no value - the AI is about to have several units encircled to the NE of town and the first few blocks of Sharpsburg. But the AI is like ""hey, Dunker Church is undefended and historically important, so we should capture that. The actual tactical situtation on the ground is irrelevant."" 

Eventually, every playthrough, I lose interest. Why spend this hour fighting this battle if the result doesn't matter when it comes to the battle I fight next? Or the army I face next? Or how well I fight doesn't matter as much as if I can send a unit on an end-run march to capture and hold some historically important (but not important in the context) point on the map?

Hopefully some patch comes out that fixes the melee, fixes the endless charging and maybe someday a branching campaign mode. Because it certainly does not ""fully depend on player actions and battle results"" right now. It is almost fully independent of player actions and results. If that happens, I'll be excited to revise this review and put as many hours as I can spare into the battles.",1489724062,1489724062,False,187,3,0.889999866485595703,17,True,False,True

As you probably figured, in this game you pick your side (Union/Confederates) and build up your own Army  - from a single Corps with a couple Brigades in just one Division to a much larger one including up to 30 units, each of them customized by its experience level, commanding officers and equipment!)

You'll get to fight small engagements to improve your army before tackling the larger historical battles of the Civil War, and although you'll fight ""real time"", the game allows for enough control not to get overwhelmed with information.

Of course, the game is still early access and there are a few bugs to address - routing units recover too quick in my opinion and they behave very stupidly when close to the edge of the map, but the game is still very playable and enjoyable as it is.

Features that i enjoy in the campaign is the fact that youcan rename brigades, give each unit different equpiment and the rank of the officer in the brigade effects their preformance. Battle wise and graphics is good to great. for the battles to win engagments you have to take ertain control points like in gettysburg however these control points, unlike gettysburg, will become contested meaning the opposing side can capture with ease if they break your forces. graphics are not what makes a game but still they are pretty good for a game like this. A good feature to also point out is the fact officer CAN get wounded or Killed. Not only that but units will surrender when out guned and numbered giving you extra troops in the campaign when building your army.

The commands have changed since the first offering by this developer (Gettysburg), and that takes some getting used to.  I'm reading the long critiques recently, and I disagree with most of the bellyaching.  A few points...

(1)  The commands aren't currently well explained. As one reviewer points out, it takes practice to see the difference between retreat, fallback, and ""reform"" to a better position.  For example, if you ""reform"" a unit, say, just behind their current position, your unit will slowly pivot under potentially withering enemy fire with flanking bonuses. Don't do this; just fallback.  Trial and error teaches.  I assume a guide is coming with the impending release.

(2) Some of these reviewers seem to enjoy godlike access to enemy dispositions and unit control.  I don't think this is realistic.  Frankly, micromanaging every unit movement, facing, and target on the battle is unrealistic.  I guess these reviewers havn't read about all the lost/intercepted orders, misunderstood commands, and bungling subordinates that were common in every civil war engagement.  In big battles I prefer to control a corps and use general movements to guide the rest of the corps that are not part of my personal command.  Sure, you don't get to kill 65% of the enemy army, but it makes for a more interesting and realistic overall experiance.  It can be very chaotic, which is probably a lot more realistic.

(3) The AI could use some strategic help, but not major stuff.  For example, if outnumbered 3:1, don't attack.  Just fall back.  Once a battle breaks down into a rout, I have seen a single unit turn around and charge back.  There is no way an army would go on the tactical offensive with 50% strength at the end of a long day of fighting.

(4) Players need to understand that they can pick the upcoming engagement before they rebuild their army at camp.  This takes the place of some sort of theater level of strategy.",1488217096,1488217096,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Because it emphasizes on modern elements of combat (fire, movement, cover) and adds the classical, occasional bayonet or cavalry charge, keeping it fun, simple and ""realistic"". An excellent approach for an operational wargame, US civil war era. It also shines in ""time/space"" effects on battle, staying true to the fundementals of warfare in the 1800s. Having the right brigade at the right place and at the right time is crucial to success. In campaign mode you also get the chance to grow your own army, with leaders, weapons, traits etc. Extremely addictive.
Sound and music is excellent (opinions may vary with taste). Graphics are ""ok"", but that's not a major issue here.
Cons? 
I would say that the unintuitive interface/setup for campaign mode are major drawbacks for newcomers, and there is no real tutorial. These drawbacks can become very frustrating when combined with the scaling mechanism. In minor battles you could get outnumbered pretty quick, not knowing what to do about it. Even in battles where you are supposed to outnumber the AI (you only bring one of your corps to minor battles).
The scaling mechanism has been questioned by many. IMO, there's a risk that devs will ruin this game by listening to demands for change. Campaign is actually a linked battle mode, there is no way to wage your own civil war. Even when you win historical battles that were lost, you will show up for next historical battle with historical odds. Sounds irritating? Not to me. I'd rather play Antietam as CSA knowing I'll have a hard time winning, than playing ""battle of Boston"" or whatever, because I did so well in my campaign. IMO, historical battles need historical odds to capture attraction to history. It's much more satisfying winning Gettysburg as CSA than winning the battle of ""Unknowntown"" with overwhelming forces.

I have to admit that it is difficult if you are playing the South and prefer the North as it is easier to make progress and survive into the later battles. It is realistic and enjoyable.

I only have a couple of minor issues that I find annoying: 

supply wagons seem to get captured easily and they sometimes go into places that don't really make sense

when moving large groups of troops in different brigades etc forward they soemtimes fan out and end up separated or crossing over each other 

However these are very minor issues and I would wholeheartedly recommend this game. 

It is a significant step forward from the stand alone Gettysburg game which was hugely enjoyable on its own.

Great developers seem to actually listen to the community
Overall a fun game
Actually feels like im fighting a war.
It's a great yet terrible feeling watching my charge end in the slaughter of half my army just to win a battle, Its great cause I won yet terrible because losses actually matter a lot in this game. Lose to many men in one battle and you might never recover.
Love watching my beautiful yankees crush through rebel lines





Enemy Armies seem infinite, for example I lost 30,000 at Antietam Union lost 40,000, next battle I was obviously still recovering but somehow the union seemed unfazed to say the least.
I wish the campaign was just a bit more free. It would be cool if insted of attacking Getysburg I could attack somewhere else, or even to take that further, insted of attacking little round top and the union left by force. I insted decide where my attack would commence and when.

502520,30051875,76561198010134542,0,31,884,0,853,1690397240,"First off, I am a huge Civil War buff and really, really wanted to like this game.  However, I just can't.  On the surface, it looks good, but every time I play a battle, I remember why I just can't really like this game or recommend it.  I will play it still because I am a Civil War fan, but each time I log off, I will end up being sadly disappointed for the following reasons.

1.)  Campaign continuity.  Sure, your troops follow you and gain experience, can be equipped, etc.  That is all well and good. However, there the campaign stops.  I have fought past Antietam and have inflicted at least 65% casualties on the rebels in every battle (normally closer to the 85-90% range).  Yet the rebel armies don't diminish, they just get larger.  So basically, I've killed 100,000 rebels and in the meantime they've gone from fielding units of 700 to units of 2300.  Explain the logic here?  Campaign is really an inaccurate description, this is a chain of scenarios that requires you to grind through bigger and bigger enemies in each scenario.  It is not a campaign.

2.)  Underpowered artillery.  Others have said this too.  My expensive, top-tier Whitworths can't get within a quarter of the map of enemy units.  Even when they do, a barrage of shells kills maybe 12-20 guys (from a ten gun battery against close formation?).  I can more or less ignore their artillery, unless it is firing flank or rear.  Even then, it doesn't do damage, just destroys morale when it kills like four guys.

3.)  Broken morale.  Morale clearly does not apply the same for player and AI.  My artillery firing cannister at the enemy flank?  Nothing.  Their artillery firing round shot into my flank, killing six guys?  Instant 40% morale drop.  Brand new rebel unit charging three Veterancy Two units (morale and accuracy upgrades)?  One of my units gets routed, even though it has a morale upgrade and outnumbers their attackers by 780 to 1120.  AI units charge across an open field, eat volleys from three units and route your unit despite being outnumbered and this happens regularly.  Just not realistic.  If the rebels had been that suicidally brave, they would have stormed Washington with clubs and kitchen knives.

4.)  Victory calculation mechanics.  Four battles now, I have annihilated over 85% of the enemy and had the rest running as fast as they could.  Guess what?  I lost one and drew one because my infantry were 5 seconds late to recapture or capture a point.  Nevermind that they could have waltzed in there once they got done hunting the remaining rebels through the forests.  We were defending a hill, the rebels are running back to Richmond or lieing dead on the hill face.  I don't think it should count as a defeat because my infantry didn't plop down to cook dinner in the right farm yard.  Victory conditions need to take into account casualties inflicted, number of enemy units still cohesive, etc.  In real life, even if I was pushed back, if I had killed 20,000 rebels for 4,500 Yankees, I think that would be considered a near victory for the US and a definite Pyrrhric victory for the rebels.

5.)  The scenario chain strikes again.  The next battle should be determined by what happened in the previous battle.  For example, as the Union, I have decisively and catastrophically defeated the rebels in every engagement.  Over 100,000 rebels were dead before Antietam.  So why, oh why, is Lee trying to invade Maryland (the cause of the Antietam campaign)?  How did I get to Gettysburg when I've killed more men in two years that the Confederates lost historically in the entire war?  If a Union player is winning so decisively, then why is he forced to fighting through a rigidly and poorly scripted series of scenarios?  If this were a campaign, wouldn't the battle move towards the Confederates defending their capital or heartlands from an aggressive and resurgent Union Army?

Basically, this game is a big let down.  I really wanted to like this game.  I imagined something similar to Ultimate Generals Gettysburg, where the outcome of one day would affect the next day.  Instead, I got Ultimate General Scenario Ladder.  It feels like an old arcade game.  No matter how many goons you kill, you have to go to the next, scripted level where there are even more goons and a bigger boss battle.  Twenty years ago, that would have been acceptable, but in the wake of so many other outstanding strategy games, I would hope that the strategy community expects more.  Good generalship that leads to decisive victory should be rewarded.  Battles should flow in a logical sequence.  Enemy forces should be affected by losses similar to how the player is.  If, as the player, you lost 80-90% of your army in battle after battle, you'd be done in a couple of scenarios.  If the player does the same, then the player should culminate in attacking Richmond or ending the Civil War heroically and triumphantly (remember, everyone at the start was convinced it would be a ninety day war).

Oh, and please, just once, for once, get artillery right.  It is absolutely ridiculous how underpowered it is.  A battery of 10 Whitworths firing at a marching rebel unit over half a map of open field should decimate that unit, not inflict (optimistically speaking) 50 casualties on a 2300 man unit.",1487572398,1487573596,False,168,3,0.777973711490631104,19,True,False,True

Units don't do what you tell them and then run away when they get slightly spooked, there's cooldowns on abilities like charge, they like to do their own thing and head off to places you haven't told them to and when you're men are tired they won't do much more than stand still slugging away at each other.
However as i've played i've found that there's ways around all of these things if you use your mind.  The more i thought about it all these little things make sense too. They simulate real battle conditions rather than many strategy games which use troops which act like robots.
To counter the negative reviews i've not had a single crash whilst playing this game.  Many of the comments about troops in battle can be countered by using tactics or thinking about what you're doing.  The points about always facing overwhelming numbers are not valid i've found. If you're playing the CSA it makes perfect sense. If I have been outnumbered i've still been able to win by again using tactics which i believe is the point of the game. You can turn huge numbers of troops on their heels by outflanking them and decimating their numbers in the process. Nothing's more satisfying than trapping a massive body of troops between a frontal infantry charge and cavalry at the rear.
This is a thinking persons game requiring some cunning to win battles which i like a lot. 
All that being said the army recruitment is a bit basic and the campaign can drag a little but it's early days for this game yet.
On a final note give this game a try. It's doubtful it's for everyone because it's not easy to get the hang of but persevere and you'll find a truly excellent game even in this early stage.",1487411455,1487427586,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I actually did not realise it was Early Access (says on the tin I know, but I was probably too excited, when I saw it first, to read everything). 

The game is already so well done that it is working better than many so called finished games.
It is nice to have many options to create the Army as one would like to. And the campaign map is great.
I really enjoy this game very much. 

If there is anything that could be improved then it would be in my opinion:

Some weapons are only available in very small numbers and it takes ages to get enough together to fit out a whole unit.
Either one should be able to create smaller units or be able to mix weapons within a unit (which is probably a pain to code).
As smaller units take a whole slot in your division though, one would need to potentially not have a specific number of units in a division, but a specific number of soldiers. I accept that this might be too late to change at this point of the coding.

I started the campaign mode a few times and it seems it follows the same path again and again. If the game would change this around a little bit then this would be great and make the game very ""re-playable"". Even though one might have a different ""Army"" set up each time one plays the campaign, one faces the same battles and encounters. Maybe the game is too historical accurate here and a more ramdom approach may be better, or at least the option for it.

If I remember correctly then Sid Meiers civil war game had a random battle creator. A random campaign created (following loosly the historical) would make this game irresistable.

Please understand me correctly. This is a truly great game, a couple of items could just be even better.

Pros:
-Fantastic AI, the best I've ever seen
-The ability -nay, the privilage- to play a fully functional campaign as the Union or The Confederacy
-Historical acuracy to an incredible degree, right down to the individual guns and canons you can arm your battallions with
-Historical battles, again far better then any of the historical battles in the Total War series
-The ability to completely customize your individual brigades, from naming them, to choosing officers, to arming them with historically acurite weapons
-Really incredible and realistic battles, from ordering your troops to defend a sunken road, to managing the logistics of munitions and supplies among your various divisons.

Cons:
-Again, if you're expecting to be dazzled by graphics, you've come to the wrong place. They aren't really terrible, but they ain't Total War: Atilla, either.  I personally like the graphics, they're fairly pretty, yet don't hog computer resources.
-There's not much in the way of a soundtrack. I assume they'll probably throw together a few songs when the final version comes out. But for now, the sounds of rifle fire and the thunder of heavy artillary are this game's backround music.

All-in-all, this is easily the most fantastic game I've ever played. Somehow it manages to walk the line perfectly, allowing customization, yet not forcing the user to micromanage everything.  Not only would I recomend it to a friend, I already HAVE recomended it to several friends.

When I first thought about buying it, the price seemed a little steep for an early release game. But after playing it, I'm more then happy to support the continued development of this incredible simulation of the bloodiest conflict in American history.

Furthermore, the game makes you care about your men, as you use them in every battle and you have to equip them, train them and appoint their commanders yourself. This means that you have a real incentive to use real tactics, rather than simply blindly charging at the enemy. Most of the issues in this game are minor, avoidable and forgivable for a game in early access (such as brigades being completely destroyed because they've followed an enemy across the map and then been surrounded, as they don't know to disengage themselves). However, this game does have 1 blaring issue, and that's the victory requirements. If you don't want to spend 4 hurs fighting a battle only for the game to randomly declare that you've lost for some arbitrary reason that in no way reflects real strategy, this isn't the game for you. The worst example fpr this was the 2nd Battle of Bull Run. I'd mnaged after 3-4 hours of fighting to surround the enemy and destoy them. They had around 700-800 of their 30-40k men left to contest me, while I had around 25k. I thought I was right on the verge of victory, until i was alerted that I had lost the battle, because in destroying the entire Southern Army under Jackson and Longstreet, I'd lost 40% of my own corps. I don't claim to be a mastermind of a 19th century general, but if I had capture both Jackson and Longstreet, and killed or taken prisoner the entire CSA force on the Peninsula, while losing less than half a corps, I'd be pretty damn pleased. It'll be a while before I can be bothered to open this game up again just to fight that 4 hour long battle all over again with the possibility of losing to any 1 of the many petty reasons that exist in the this game, from arbitrary casaulty figures, to random hills of virtually no strategic importance. I'd recommend this game, but only on the basis that you have the patience to endure spending up to 12 hours at a time replaying battles to achieve victories that you'd earned on your first attempt.

Still large in scale). Well, needless to say, I had a few brigades waiting virtually at the edge. I misjudged how many men the Union were throwing my way. What should have been a defensive battle on my end, where I would have had the advantage, it became an all-out brawl as I was forced to move my forces up from their defensive positions to ensure that few or none of my forces got utterly destroyed. I eventually pushed the Union back, but at a cost of roughly 1:1, what I consider to be an intolerable cost of life on my end.

I will write this one because first of all I think this game is great and is deserving of your hard-earned cash, and second, there aren't that many reviews yet and someone might actually read this.

You SHOULD get this game if:

1. You want an example of excellent early access implementation. As far as I understand it, this game is feature complete, but missing about half the content in terms of battles in the campaign. Its also stable, runs well, and nearly bug-free.

2. You are a Total War fan but have long wanted something that plays similarly (at least in the real-time battles) but is vastly more realistic, deep, and has noticeably better AI.

3. You want a strategy-heavy wargame where decisions outside the battles when managing your troops, money, reputation, officers, and equipment are just as important as the decisions in the real-time battles.

4. You are a Civil War history buff. I personally am not, but I've learned a lot in-game and have spent a couple hours in total looking at Wikipedia pages reading about battles that I just played because they so fascinated me. I can see why others have said this could easily be the best Civil War game of all time.

5. You want a strategy game where you both have a ton of units, but also controls well. It's hard to go back to a Total War game after playing this based on user interface and controls alone. I generally groan a bit at the chore of controlling so many units at once, but I've found it to be a joy here. I actually LIKE playing out the huge battles, as they don't feel unwieldy in the same way other games do.

6. You want a difficult game. Even as a RTS/grand strategy/Total War vet playing as far back as the 90s I couldn't cut it even on normal difficulty, where the AI got no bonuses whatsoever. Now that I'm a good way though my ""easy"" campaign (which I still am NOT steamrolling) I feel more ready to tackle normal difficulty, especially since losing one battle is not game over, just a reputation, money, and manpower hit. Multiple losses is the failure state: you get fired as general by the president.

7. You appreciate a cleanly-crafted, high-quality game. Everything from the sound and graphic design to the interface is simple, unobtrusive, and a pleasure to experience. VERY well done indeed.

8. You want a fair game. If you are losing an engagement over and over, its probably a mistake that YOU are making, such as funneling troops into a kill zone, trying to run them on an uphill charge, not paying attention to your flanks, or expecting your injured regiment to stand and fight when being shot at from multiple sides. Interestingly enough, many of these mistakes could be ones that actually happened in history in that battle, which is why the engagement was lost. Think it through, watch a more competent Youtuber play it, and don't ask the impossible of your men. 


You SHOULD NOT get this game if:

1. You want ""flashiness"". While the game certainly looks nice--particularly the terrain--a graphics showcase this is not. Units for example are very low-res spites even at max zoom. The upside of course is very low system requirements.

2. One of the main reasons you play games like Total War is to zoom in and watch your units beating the tobacco juice out of each other.  You simply can't zoom in very far here, and units are very simply animated.

3. You want to play on both your desktop and laptop. There's no Steam cloud integration, and in 2017 there's no excuse for that. Maybe it will come at full release?

4. You want to play multiplayer. There's no PvP, no co-op, no nothing, and as far as I understand it, there never will be. That's a shame.

5. You want any kind of ""grand strategy"" game where you are a conqueror, painting the map your color. This is NOT Total War style where there's a turn-based grand strategy layer, or an actual grand strategy game like Europa Universalis. This is all about real battles at real times, with persistent army management aspects between fights. To be fair, this management layer is far more in-depth for your actual armies than any other game mentioned. To put it another way, you are NOT truly playing as the Union or the Confederacy; you are playing as a custom-made general with his own history and skillset that goes and fights predetermined battles for said countries.

6. You want a game you can put 500+ hours into. I personally have put more than that into games like Medieval II Total War, Crusader Kings II, and Europa Universalis IV over the years, but I cannot see that happening even when this game is finished. You fight realistic, historically accurate, but very predetermined battles throughout the Civil War on one side or the other. The battles themselves are not scripted (except between the persistent stages of the huge ""grand battles"" like Gettysburg), but they are in fact the same battles with the same setup no matter how many times you play the game.

7. You like good tutorials. I don't know if it's a symptom of early access, but I had no Idea what I was doing in the beginning, and the few advice tips were so general/vague/obvious they were no help at all. It only took me about an hour to get into the swing of things, though--and for a strategy game, that's not too bad.

8. You love good unit variety. Realistically so, there's not much actual variety here: this one one country fighting itself. There's infantry, skirmishers, cavalry, and artillery--that's it. To be fair you can customize each with a surprising variety of different guns, officer ""perks"", and unit sizes, but there is no thrill of pitting Redcoats vs. Minutemen, Ork Boyz vs. Space Marines, etc.

TL:DR. This is an incredible war game in every way that matters to me: AI, strategic depth, and controls/UI. While it may not have the nearly-unending longevity or open-endedness of some grand strategy games, I highly recommend Ultimate General: Civil War even in its current state to any experienced strategy gamer.",1486124558,1486125109,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. Difficulty: Even for a relatively experienced RTS gamer, the level of difficulty for the campaign is excessively challenging. Sometimes due to overwhelming enemy strength but in other circumstances due to (mysterious) buffs that the AI enjoys at the moment. For example, the Union first mission pools you against Confederate defensive position and reinforcement that arrives in an ironclad train with heavy artillery support. Your reinforcement arrives just in time to witness you overwhelmed by enemy numbers and the rest of the mission might see you retaking the town and (trying) to destroy the train with 6 pdr. Unnecessarily difficult (and imo unbalanced) mission.
2. Bugs and imbalances. For an early access, bugs and unbalances would be rather an unavoidable thing so this is more of a reflection than complaint. So far, the most annoying bug would be the flanking and rear flanking penalties your troops suffer while manovering. This normally happens when your troops try to turn to face your enemy in an awkward manner. (I would say pathfinding is an issue here). 
3. Controls: Greatly improved over Gettysburg but some improvements may still be implemented. Firstly, movement by corps or divisions would be welcomed to allow long disance marching. Especially useful for reinforcements. Secondly, instead of making brigades ignore fire by default, it might be more convenient to provide an ignore fire option. Too many times I see brigades trying to march past enemy position and suffer constant flanking fires till the brigade is decimated just because a previous order asks them to move a few meters more. This behaviour is neither realistic (I dun imagine the union or confederates to be so disciplined and selflessly recklessly bold) nor helpful for gamers.

one of my main issues with this game is that i have two full corps of troops. but one is battle tested and has 12 brigades. my second has 10 brigades and totally raw experienced and non battle tested. my issue is that in your deployment phase, your only allowed a certain amount of brigades to enter the map. especially in the early part of the game since the union will always outnumber you no matter what. this bugs me, because after all my victories so far, why im not able to deploy both corps is beyond me and frustrates me as im forced to use my weaker of the two corps watch it get decimated time after time until im able to bring in the more experienced one.

Pros:
Battles are intense and challenging
Good AI Opponent
Can rename corps' and brigades which is a neat small thing
A good Roster of Historical Battles (more are supposed to be added at the time of this review)n
Fun Campaigns for both sides
No Paywall content
Huge scale for battles
Cons: 
Some bugs here and there
AI does weird decisions from time to time
No Multiplayer (as of yet)

I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good ACW RTS!

I bought this as it looked fun and I have Ultimate General: Gettysburg so I thought I would give this one a try.

Pro's
Game is fun at first
Hints help you out in the begging of campaign missions
No FPS drops or bug crashes that I experienced

Con's
Battle timer if RIDICULOUS. This is just a lazy LAZY way of adding difficulty to the game and you will find yourself being forced into frontal charges just so you can capture an objective before the timer runs out. This absolutely DESTROYS any strategy at all as strategy is about maneuvar and WAITING for the right time to attack. (This is my biggest problem with the game)
AI is subpar at best. The AI often times attacks you head on instead of going for an obvious flanking attack on you and the AI doesn't coordinate anything with their troops. They often would attack me piecemeal in suicidal frontal charges.
Graphics are worse than UG: Gettysburg and the camera can't be zoomed in at all and even when zoomed out, you can tell that low res graphics are used for units. 
Units will ALWAYS move themselves unless they are stationed defnding a fort wall. Otherwise, your cavalry, skirmishers, general and supplies move themselves. More than once, I went to look for my general where I left him only to find him across the map surrounded and dying.
This game is all about Infantry. They are like tanks and take hit after hit after hit while your artillery, skirmishers and calvary are all absolutely worthless especially when you tell them to attack and they decide to ignore you and move on their own backwards away from the fight. Artillery is stupidly weak even at point blank range. Firing range doesn't do jack except for Inf. Whether you are at max range or point blank range with every other unit type, you get roughly the same results. 

Overall, this is a subpar game as of right now with major balancing issues needing attention and a better AI.",1484949661,1484949661,False,5,0,0.506860613822937012,2,True,False,True

You don't build units on the map, you don't gather/capture resources, you don't choose how/where you fight. You build your army and send it into battle. But, you must also remember that your force represents a portion of the overall war effort. There are 'smaller engagements' between the major battles. Often times these events are large distances apart and only a day or two apart in time. So, they limit the forces you can use on these battle as they are minor engagements, you don't send your entire army for a minor engagement. I would like to see an additional restriction where if I use 1st division in a minor battle in TN that 1st division isn't available for a battle the next day in Eastern VA. But, that is a relatively minor squabble and would add a lot of complexity for trying to balance your army.

The negative reviews also mention problems with unit responsiveness. But, it appears most of those people haven't put the time in to learn the interface. IF you have played any of the Total War games you should be able to pick up the interface and how units work quickly. But, if you come from something like COH you will have a big learning curve for how units operate. I also thought the units moved strangely at first but after an hour or so everything started to make sense. 

Things I would like to see improved:
-More intuitive range indicators
-A balancing of Artillery (some are crap but it is still EA)
-A better tutorial to ease players into both the battle and the camp.

Overall I think this game is phenomenal and highly recommend it.

In a lot of ways its like a spiritual successor to the Sid Meier’s ACW games, which were some of my favorite games as a kid. But UG:CW improves on those in almost every way. The maps and controls work great. The campaign is amazing, and something I dreamed of back in the SMG days. I especially like how you can tweak, upgrade weapons, recruit new units or bolster current ones and all those management features of the campaign. 

Even though its not complete, the campaign already feels great. The amount of maps they have so far is quite impressive. And they have been adding to it quite quickly. If they continue with the polish and additions at the rate they have been going this will easily be my favorite ACW game. 

The Take Command/Scourge of War series has a lot of strengths in terms of control, and the fact its the better simulation. And for some that will certainly make it the better game. But UG:CW has the balance of arcade vs sim that I find more enjoyable and more willing to dive into time and time again. 

They still have a good bit of work before the game is truly complete. And I hope they will add to the campaign in a way that allows for more flexibility, and an ability to wage the war the way you want, thus giving you the ability to play it a-historically. I would also like some what if type one off scenarios or what ifs to actual battlefields. They could also add a multiplayer side similar to SMG, where a team can split up the forces, like one commands arty one inf one cav. Essentially, each player would pick the generals and get the troops under that/those generals command/s. But even still, if they just complete out the campaign and continue to patch and polish (I haven't had issues/bugs but for those that do) this will easily sit next to Scourge of War (I really see that as one game even though you have to buy each battle separately, which certainly gives UG:CW a leg up) as the best ACW games to date.",1484706467,1484714428,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

You play the part of a newly appointed Corps commander and have to work your way up the ladder; using skill points to increase your Division and Brigade sizes and troop sizes within said Division and Brigades. You can pay for veterans or recruits to expand your armies but they must be equiped with weapons (and they don't just appear out of nowhere). To get additional weapons you must either purchase them or steal them from your enemies through managing to capture an enemy supply wagon. 

After your first battle (hopefully you don't get your butt handed to you), you will embark on several campaigns; I say campaigns because each significant battle has smaller skirmishes/battles that can directly support your efforts in the main battle (lets say Shiloh). If you do well in the two battles leading into Shiloh then you can tip the scales (although slightly) in your favor. 

How you play on the battlefield can really screw you up if you are a bad tactician; for instance, you can forget to put your infantry in cover that you've been building XP with the past 5 games only for them to be descimated and the commander KIA. Now your back to building an infantry brigade all over again for the next five games.

They do not flee towards their commanders or towards the nearest controlled point. Or any other logical manner. Instead I've seen my own units flee into the same fire that broke them, enemy units flee towards the objective they need to win the battle, or just mill aimlessly under fire. A second major issue is that unit turning is often broken. A simple wheel often turns into some sort of elaborate 360 degree pivot and leaves the unit vulnerable to fire. The last primary issue is that frontal cavalry charges actually work against steady infantry. A steady bayonet equipped infantry unit, in line, should completely butcher any Civil War era cavalry in a charge. Civil War cavalry is primarily for harrasment and recon rather than shock action, certainly shock action should at least require near parity in numbers or a battered and unsteady infantry unit. Or a rear charge to an engaged unit. Instead I've seen 300 cavalry frontally charge and route twice their number and more in 100% morale infantry.

The Good:
The gameplay is what makes this game.  Controls can be grasped in a few minutes and are incredibly fluid.   None of the sillyness that comes with Total War games.  No fidgiting about making lines the prefect size or perfecting formations while your right flank is bulldozed by the AI.  I want to direct my brigades as fast as possible and move my army effectively.  I mean this is Ultimate General, not Scrub Colonel Simulator.  Battles play out unpredicably and mercilessly.  This is a real strategy game and requires real thought to play well.  Charge at the wrong time and watch as your 3000 man brigade is completely shredded in a few seconds.   Cannons can devastate entire divisions or amount to little more than glorified spitballs depending on how you deploy them.  Maps are huge, pleasing to look at, and offer plenty of options to feint and flank.  Learn to use skirmishers and calvarly effectively or prepare to make a large investment in battlefield medicine.

The Bad:  
It's not done yet, but I don't know if I would fully consider it bad though.   Early access when used correctly has been a very useful tool to creating a great finished product.  There is also the fact that this is an isometric view which some people might have problems with.  Personally I love looking at the hand drawn maps and a mild 3d effect has been applied to the terrain to help identify elevation changes.  This is a huge improvement over the first UG game and is so effective that more than once I've caught myself pressing the 'Q' or 'E' key and expecting the view to rotate.  

Conclusion  (for now):  
A Total War style strategy game for people who don't suck at strategy games.

I'm writing because I feel like the positive reviews are not being fully honest and many are vague about a game that is pretty obviously still in the working process. Not only do reviews like that hurt the purchaser, but they hurt the devs. trying to make the game good.

When you start a campaign you are given choices on stats, which have no explanation on how they will effect later gameplay. Very bare-bones, but hey, its early dev. so I just plowed through with a balance of stat choices. I do like that there were many options. You are immediately thrown into a battle, despite the stat choices at the start, and right off the bat the unit movement is sluggish and the unit graphics aren't really that great which contrast with the very nice terrain. I still go back and play stuff like Chrono Trigger & Age of Empires II, so graphics really don't bug me. But I was surprised because none of the positive reviews on here mentioned that.

Responsiveness is an absolute basic must for me in every strat. game. Even though the command card is limited, my troops were not responsive; they would skirmish against charging enemy skirmishers when I was trying to get them to engage in melee, they would retreat even with full health, supplies, and condition. There was no clear indication when I ordered a unit to engage another if they had actually received the command without sound. The movement is slow and very dissatisfying on the real time map. The poor unit responsiveness was made worse by the lack of unit detail in graphics on their movement.

I didn't continue playing past the first battle, because I didn't buy the game to review it, I bought the game to enjoy it. But I'm really surprised very few reviews seem to mention this. The initial battle was so dissatisfying I decided that even if the game had great army/map management mechanics, I wouldn't be able to play any of the battles. I do like what I saw as a base, and will try to keep track of this game for a future purchase, as I think it has a lot of potential.

To the devs: if your in-game map/army management is the strongest point to the game, (which the stat choices before the first battle, reviews, and trailer would indicate) I suggest starting your players off on the map/army management proportion of the game, and then let them select and delve into the first battle from the campaign. First impressions are very important, and I think starting off a campaign intro with your best assets would retain players.

Ultimate General: Civil War is truly a godsend to someone like me. The gameplay and mechanics are as if some of my favorite gettysburg/civil war simulations came to life. The AI is strong and smart enough to sometimes really give me a run for my money, and I enjoy the occassional loss. 
I get to make the same decisions as  great generals, or command my units with my own interpretation of the tactical and strategic situations. Seeing the enemy react to your flanking maneuver and then taking advantage of a gap in the line is intensely satisfying. The pace of the game is perfect for me. I dislike games that require too much pointing and clicking without enough time to really analyze and think about a situation. UG allows you to take action and then come up with subsequent moves. You can't take forever, but you'll never be overwhelmed by fifteen different decisions you have to make simultaneously. 
The campaign section of the game can be a little frustrating if you're looking to create a truly formidible army, but it's a neat little ""light RPG"" aspect that I ended up appreciating after taking the time to try it out and learn throughout a full campaign. It'll teach you to not have your men run through the meatgrinder, and force you to make difficult decision in battles where sacrificing a brigade is the key to winning the battle.

Like everything, Ultimate General: Civil War is not perfect. 
Some criticisms of the game do ring true:
AI weaknesses - Not knowing its own strength by (for example) never doing massed attacks when it would totally suit them, charging at random times, not being as aggressive with objectives as they could be. I personally wish that the AI was more aggressive or harder in its core programming rather than increasing the difficulty in game through troop numbers. 
I personally don't find this to be a negative, but the grand scope of a large battle can be a lot to manage for someone who isn't looking to micromanage single brigades in the midst of a large conflict. I would suggest a button that slows time as a fix to those who would like to micromanage. 
There are few alerts other than when friendly reinforcements are coming or enemy ones are spotted, or even when your own unit are in trouble. I tend to take that as a requirement to constantly pay attention, and a realism feature (they only had runners back then to issue orders). 

Overall, this is a wonderful simulation that I hope only improves and gets carried over to the many other eras and conflict where this type of game could easily translate. I hope to see many more games like this in the future. (Hint: anyone who can develop Advanced Squad Leader would be my idol).

I too thought this, until I began to understand the game mechanics. One major flaw with the game is that there is never a prompt to use your ""career"" points... I played a whole campaign without using them; I got to Shiloh and I was painfully outnumbered with far less divisions than I was facing. The problem is that without the adequate ""army organization"" points you cannot make additional divisions or corps which would allow you to have an even matchup in these earlier battles. By the time I got to Gaines' Mill I was defending with 2 divisions against 2 corps of enemies as Union. I finally restarted the campaign, this time adding extra points to my army organization through the introductory phase. Then I realized that you can simply go to the ""career"" tab when in the army formation phase and add points as I had performed quite well in the early battles, having already fought them with minimal troops. Once you add points to 'army organization' you can form much bigger corps which allows you to fully flesh out an army and present the maximum amount of forces when in battle. I see this as a design flaw because once I figured it out the game became much easier, although I lament that when first playing through I was fascinated by the micro managing of a small army against a much larger foe... I was playing through on the 'regular' difficulty on this last run through, in which I most recently won Fredericksburg as the Union by a very large margin. Another problem is the Confederacy was so whittled down that my last few battles were a breeze...

However I can see it reaching a strong recommendation in just a few patches.

The biggest issue I have with the two Ultimate General games is the lack of information given to the player. The style the developer has gone for is very minimalist for such a complex strategy game and I think it suffers because of this. 
Engagements between units are often impossible to predict as you have little information to inform your decisions. 

Most of the time I'll simply position my units in cover and whittle down the enemy, hoping their losses end up greater than mine. I have no faith in the melee system, despite how useful it should actually be, I almost always lose these engagements. Full morale units with 4 times as many soldiers and a commander unit close by will lose melee engagements and rout leaving you asking yourself what you could have done but spend another 10 minutes exchanging fire. If you hover over a patch of ground, you are given stats about the cover and terrain, but this is useless when half the map is covered in soldiers and you dont know which matter at that exact moment. Add to the confusion even more stats of each individual unit, their condition, their veterancy, their rifles, and the commander buff, it's impossible to explain how each stat interacts and how that will tangibly effect the immediate battle you're in. 

I have no doubt that there's complex mathematical algorithms behind it all taking every aspect of the a civil war battle into account to produce the most realistic response, but the reality is that it doesnt translate into a game that players can coherently understand and the mechanics available to you are too basic to match the complexity of the information you receive. Games like Total War are great at explaining stats and buffs so that you know exactly which unit should engage which enemy and in what manner. If a unit routs, you know why and the impact of armour or weapon buffs are obvious. 

The AI is fantastic and should become the standard for strategy games. The AI will fall back, regroup, counter-attack, press their advantage and use a combination of units on the attack. I love reforming my strategy as the AI tries something new and it's satisfying to overcome a opponent who is challenging because of its skill and not thanks to unfair buffs or unit spamming. I have heard rumours that the enemy armies are scaled to always be slightly better than your own, which I hope is false as it would make all of the out-of-battle micro-managing and side-missions even more pointless.

I love the visual style of the maps. A tonne of effort has gone into making the battlefields look as realistic as possible, recreating the scenes of actual civil war engagements down to the tree-lines and streams. Much like the AI, it serves as an example of the level of detail historic strategy games should meet.

I've been watching and playing this series from the beginning, even playing the Total War mods that the developers made previously, so I'll always recommend these games to strategy fans. But as this game develops, I hope to see some major changes, namely gutting the pointless out-of-battle upgrades so that only the coherent and useful ones remain and adding features to the in-battle UI to aid in strategic decision-making and understanding the state of your units.

And make melee a viable tactic.

Some of the units, especially in a big battle, have to be given orders over and over.

Also, I played Shiloh twice, the final battle for Pittsburg Landing, had it won, and both times it locked the whole PC up.

They need to fix these issues before I will play it again.

Waste of money.

Pro:

Graphic is okay and does not mean much in that game

Maps are great many different positions to defend or attack

The custom organization from the Corps, Divisions and Brigade is awesome and its the part i liked the most

The skills for the officers are nice when gain some exp during battle you can choose what style if arty or infantery, ammo aso.

Cons:

The only thing i dont like is the troop movement, i like to have the joice between line, column, square aso. but you just klick an then they move. If you select more units its quite not easy to move a whole corps down the road and for more precise movement you select one squad after another to get them we they should.

It has some issues that detract from the gameplay currently, but those are overshadowed by how awesome the other pieces of the game are.

Pros:
[list]
  [*] On the whole, the battles themselves play well. It maintains a pretty good level of difficulty throughout, as long as the AI doesn't do anything too wonky. On the whole though, it does a good job of recreating the historical battles and creating a lot of tense moments in the process.
  [*] The battles look and sound awesome, it does a good job of creating an authentic-feeling experience
  [*] While a bit cumbersome at times to do, structuring your army any way you please is pretty cool.
  [*] It's pretty rewarding to see your units become more veteran, better equipped, and generally more powerful over time. I started caring about my units a lot more than I have in other games, since I didn't want my prized elite units to get wiped out. The various perks that you get to select for each unit, along with the equipment options, do bring some interesting additional gameplay combinations too.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
  [*] The enemy AI can be a bit brain-dead at times. I've seen it completely give up on attacking a VP with little time remaining to chase a cavalry brigade. I've seen it wheel a brigade in front of mine several times to deal with a minor threat that caused an immediate route. I've seen it attack piecemeal with individual units, or only use a small portion of their force to defend a crucial VP while several brigades stand idly by. I'm hoping the AI will improve during early access, because I think these are correctable issues, but it definitely needs some work.
  [*] I've had a lot of trouble with the AI doing silly things with my units too. There's an issue on the Malvern Hill map that can cause Union units to retreat through enemy lines, where they get obliterated. I've also had issues with artillery magically making its way in front of my line or units repositioning themselves under heavy fire, leading to them being routed.
  [*] The enemy army scaling with the size of yours takes quite a bit of fun out of things. I understand the devs do it to keep things challenging as you go, but it feels pretty frustrating to obliterate the enemy in one battle, only to be faced with overwhelming odds in the next battle. There are some issues too where depending on how you structure your army, the scaling can really bite you hard, so it really makes having a small group of extremely veteran units, sprinkled with some rookie cannon fodder, a dominant strategy.
  [*] There are still some random bugs in there that can be frustrating at times, like when my retinue of reserve officers suddenly disappeared when I went to look at the details of a battle, then went back to camp. I'm hoping most of those will get sorted out in Early Access though.
[/list]

The game allows you to create a general with his own traits and eventually make the ultimate choice of which side you support. After the first battle you collect your commanders and recruit your men in order to best accomodate your command style. You can provide your men with the cheapist gear and have countless rookie troops, or give them the best weapons available and have smaller numbers of nearly fearless veterans. Each regiment type has its strengths and weaknesses that can be used or abused if you plan accordingly. By using Skirmishers or Sharpshooters you can lure away the larger contingents of the enemy's army and run down their artillery with hidden reserves of cavalry.

In summary the game is incredibly fun if you have an itch for Civil War games that hasn't been scratched since the last ultimate General or even American Conquest: Divided Nation you will more than likely enjoy this game.

The game recognizes that it is extremely hard to hold on to some parts, and allows you to withdraw in order to save your army. The new campaign feature is excellent, with a customisable that grows from one division to 3 corps, and the game itself is very well balanced - cavalry has the right balance between massive shock damage and horrifyng vulnerbility to fire.

Pros- very challenging AI. Even at the lowest level you will find yourself losing battles if you make mistakes.  Different game modes to enjoy. The campaing walks you through a number of different battles- you can level up yourself (gaining more recruits, the ability to command a larger army, etc), and also the troops under your command.  Or you can do a quick battle, or you can play any number of scenarios based on actual historical battles.  Cons- graphics look a bit dated (don't get me wrong- it's still a great looking game).  In campaign mode,  victory is almost always tied to taking or holdiing an objective for a set  amount of time - I think it would be better to have to force the enemy from the field - at  least in some of the campaings. 
Overall a great game!  Grab a copy and enjoy!

Pros

* The campaign is fun to playing though it is nifty that battle have more real life consequences for instance if a divisional commander is killed then they are dead and not comming back. Also if you lose a battle then the enemy gets an advantage in the next battle. 

* Customization of the units is really cool, you can name your brigades, arm them how you want, assign them commanders, and determine their skill sets. 

*    Battles are challeging and if you forget a portion of the battlefield then your troops will end up getting slaughtered or will break.

*Adding surrendering units/ supply depots adds more realisim, (this is a mix bag as I have some cons about this.) Overall it is an improvment being able to capture troops adds more realism and being able to completly overwhelm the enemy and force a surrender is incredibly satisfying

Cons 

* It feels like I have to kill the same generals over and over again, in the battle of Bull Run I captured Burnsides Brigade and when I looked at the unit info Burnside was dead (probally helped the Union) but in the verry next battle I captured Burnside's Brigade again and they were led by Burnside again.  I think it would be niffity if generals who die on the other side stayed dead. 

*The Original UG: Gettysburg offered more alternates to the historical battle, if the union held Mcpherson's Ridge then they could decide the next phase of their defense andit was more open to an alternative battle and I was a but disapointed when this feature was not present in that if the Confederates historicaly defended a Ridge then by god you are defending that ridge rather than an alternative stratgey.

* THe supply waggons deplete way to quickly, if I have my wagons hangout by my arttillery then within 10 minutes my wagons are out of ammunition and completley useless. 

*Liberated prisioners of war shouldn't be able to shoot, if they are captured then they should remain unarmed for the rest of the battle and liberation shouldn't change that. Also it is infuriating that their is a POW exchange cap of 1000, because at times I've cpatured over 3,000 men but only got 1,000 recruits out of it where as in another battle I captured 700 troops yet still got 1,000 recruits

* Sometime the routing is not the swiftest, I feel that the routed troops should always head towards freindly troops. I ended up losing the battle of Shiloh because I routed a unit of Confederate calvary  and they ended up routing towards pittsburgh landing and captured it and I lost the battle because of their stupid routing direction. 

*The campaign kdoesn't give you warning about when it just leaves you with your corps, the first two battles have allied troops with you and then after that it is just your forces, a little waring would have been nice that way i wouldn't blow all my money on my corp regiments and spent more points in orginization. 

Some Ideas for improvments

*I'd like the oppritunity to play the minor engagments in a free play mode like the historical battles. Sometimes I don't have the time to play a full scale battle but would like to play the battle Perryville or South Mountian. 

*Having historic officers be given certian attributes like if they were a cavalry commander then putting them in charge of a cavalry regiment should boost the units skill where as if they were in charge of artillery then their command attributes be dimminished. 

* More decisions on what to do with prisoners, like exchange them for money, or get some information from them like commanders strengths and weaknesses and some information on the enemy.

* More uniform options, this will probally work better for historical battles rather than campaign but if a unit would wear a unique uniform it would be cool to see it represented, or if at the battle Fredricksburg and Stones River (when added) the Union wore their light blue overcoats.

Overall the game is great and I have enjoyed it alot, It offers alot of custimization with your units, offers a unique and entertaining fight.  The AI for the most part is intelligent and will rarley blunder (like in total war) and you can't just go set it and forget it in an assualt and it makes you more invested in the game. There are some componets that can be better but overall it is worth a buy and a look.

First to point out, it is not only strategy game, but also game about logstics and planning. Winning battrles gives you money and some credit points with government which you then spend to buy officers, weapons and other stuff. Having some good brigades can tip scale any battle in your favour very fast. For example I bought the most expensive sniper rifles for my 400 men skirmishers brigade, with which I then killed over 3000 enemy soldiers in next battle while only lost about 30 men in brigade. Sometimes it is even good to have some ""cannon fodder"" brigades which can soak some altillery fire while you move you units to flank enemy or just to snipe their most precious units.

I still don't really know what the efficiency does and I wish the game had explained that better (if anyone knows please tell me).

It would also be cool if you could get a constructer unit which could dig ditches or obstacles which could make better tactical positions!

The time is killing and sometimes you need to do a last minute rush to capture a position, I always time them right so I can hold the position for the required time but it is a bit unrealistic to end an attack mission with 'safed by the bell' (if you know what I mean.

This will be revised once the game is launched.

I own the original UG: Gettsburg and while I thought it was a decent game, it was too limited in scope. I posted in the forums that the game felt like an entertaining tech demo for a variety of reasons. While I'm not covering those reasons in this review (you can go read my UG: Gettsburg review), I thought it was merely okay but a good value given the inexpensive price. But I wanted more. 

Enter UG:CW which I only bought because of some of the Let's Plays out there. 

This game fixes virtually everything I did not like about the first game. Everything is improved. I know that's a blanket statement but it's true. The maps are even more visually spectacular with great places to set up ambushes and plan defensive lines. While before there were broad forests, this game has hills, rivers,creeks and clumps of realistically-spaced trees that provide wonderful tactical options. Catching the enemy in a crossfire coming down a country road is a thing of beauty to behold. Holding fire and opening up with your cannons at almost point blank range to stop a charge gets the adrenaline pumping.

The isometric perspective has changed a bit and I feel more engaged in the battles becaus of it. I can see my units better. The already great UI has improved so that I get all the information about my troops that I want. There are some tweaks that I hope are still coming on the movement - sometimes it's hard to get a unit *exactly* where you want it - but the interface makes this game easy to pick up. 

Battles are set up in multiple stages but you often get a chance to command the whole battlefield. This is quite different than UG:Gettsburg where I never felt like I was in command of the largest engagement of the entire war with over 200,000 troops on the battlefield.

For example, in the Shiloh battle as the Union you start with an encounter to the West. It's limited to a few thousand troops as you defend a position. Once you complete that battle you get to fight on the East side of the battlefield - this battle being more difficult as the Rebels outnumber you. Then the game brings both of those together exactly as you left each battle. So now you are commanding both fronts trying to hold each position and you're dealing with low ammo, tired troops and reinforcements coming down the pike. I desperately held on to both defensive positions but my troops were exhausted, low on ammo and had taken some punishment.

I was ready to call it a day. But no...the next stage tasked me with a historically accurate withdraw to better defensive positions (something that is rarely done well in war games) where I'm trying to prevent my tired troops from taking too much damange as we withdrew. Of course I used the opporutnity to execute a couple of ambushes along the way. By now I'm commanding 25,000 troops as we withdraw to Pittsburg landing to prevent getting overrun by the Rebels. My successful tactical engagement in one area of the battle influenced the battle elsewhere as enemy troops were forced to shift reserves to some probing counterattacks by the Union. Sound fun? It is.

There is a also a strategic layer to the game where you build your army, select your weapons, pick your leaders and grow your mighty army the way you want to see it built. IThis strategic layer isn't robust  but offers just enough to provide some quite interesting possibilities because ou can build the army the way you see fit (within the manpower and money constraints). You also level up your general and make him better in certain areas - again, as you see fit. So instead of being handed a bunch of nameless troops you become attached to your best units. You may find yourself reluctant to throw some of your troops into the meat grinder knowing how much time, manpower and money you've spent making them such a fine fighting force - and knowing that some of that expensive rare equipment isn't easy to replace if they get chewed up.

Of course the game is EA but I have yet to hit a crash or a bug. More battles are coming but I've just scratched the surface on this game. There's many more battles that I have yet to play and it appears that this game will have a lot of content by the time it's done.

Advantages:

1. challenge - most games tend to bore you once you find a winning strategy. Many games quickly get out of balance when you beat the system. UG:CW is different. It's automatic scaling system makes sure you always get a challenging battle. There's no one winning strategy, they change with every battle. In every battle you will get significant casualities. In the same time if you're less experienced, automatic scaling system will make sure you can still complete campaign.

2. unique mechanics - schemas from other strategic games can't be used in this one. In the same time gameplay is really intuitive and fun.

3. battles are engaging - in many games I found myself playing a battle just for results. Here battles are really engaging. Each one is slightly different and unique. In every battle you can find things you could do better, yet if you play this battle the second time it turns out an old winning approach wouldn't work any more, as AI played slightly differently.

4. historical accuracy - your army's equipment is very detailed, based on historical equipment. In the same time it's not complex to manage.

Disadvantages:

To be honest there aren't many. Those that I found are minor.

1. early access - There are a few inconsistencies - eg. some units have longer fire range than it's indicated. Savegames don't store information about unit abilities in battles. I'm sure those will be polished until release though. Even now they're not cumbersone.

2. graphics - if you're searching for next Total War game with stunning graphics, this one is not for you. It's focused mostly on engaging gameplay, with a very simple graphics",1483204633,1483204633,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is massive, and that causes its own problems, but I think they are doing a fine job of providing this product.  It has its problem because it is so massive, but some of these things need to be addressed.

First off, there is no way that I should be able to hit the enemy, cause thousands of of them, and they come back with even mmore troops in the next fight.  If I can only deploy 1500 troops, how can the enemy deploy brigades of over 2000?  And they seem to have unlimited abilities to do so.

Second, if I have three brigades charge a single enemy brigade, how the heck do my troops break and run?  I mean the AI  has like the best moral I have ever seen.  My troops will break and run if they lose 200 of their members fom skirmishers, but I can hit them point blank with artillery and they will fire volley after volley.  

Third, in real world, the cavalry was the armour units of their day, and yet the only cavalry units worth a dang belong to the enemy.  I can hit a Routed enemy brigade with a fresh cavalry unit, and my unit is almost wiped out.  In the real war, those cavalry units could and would destroy a running infantry unit to a man.

Fourth, the time limits on the battles needs to either be lengthened or removed altogether.  You'd be better off providing a clock of what time of day it is.  Then as a commander, you would need to plan your attack based upon what time of day it is, and how much daylight you have left to use.  Otherwise, you are rushed into an attack on an enemy you outnumber, but they have unbreakable moral.  

Finally, you need to provide better explanations for what things are in the game, and what features mean that you can select and add.  With no tutorial, it leaves you guessing on what you need to do, and a little better explanation of what means what would help.  When choosing your opening settings, you don't know why you need Army Organization +1 or Logistics +3.  You don't understand why you need Traiing +1 over Medicine +1.

The battles require thinking and carefull movement taking many things into consideration such as terrain, morale, unit composition and size, armaments, condition, command ability, and ammo. You cant just select all and attack. Correct planning and execution will win the day in this game, and in my opinion they've nailed this aspect. 

Even though its still in early access, this game has worked on my PC as good as a normal fully completed game usually does, with very few non game breaking bugs. Even if they never add anything to it from today onwards, I would still be satisfied with my purchase. 

I enjoyed the campaign immensely, and the new 'army camp' army bulding feature is a nice addition that adds some depth to the game. The enemy battle AI is still one of the best I've ever encoutered, if not the best; it makes me work for my victories and punishes any mistakes lazy behaviour. I never felt like I was just working against an algorithm, battles feel fluid, dynamic and require use of actual tactics and terrain.

Theres a lot that could be done to improve the game, to make a great game perfect, especially in the army camp section, and pre battle breifing where some info is not presented clearly and its all a bit unpolished.. I also preffered the unit control and interface of Gettysburg, but ultimately these things did not actually detract from my enjoyment of the battles to any noticeable degree.

It offers many improvements and new features, and retains Gettysburg's simple-to-learn format while also accomodating complex strategies. 

Pros.
-Large amount of customization. 
You can form your own army, complete with corp, division, and brigade level organization. You can choose the composition of your army, making it mostly infantry, heavily emphasizing cavalry, etc. 
You can dictate the officers, traits, weapons, men, and supplies that each unit will receive. 
You can grow your army as you succeed in battle, or carefully reorganize it to compensate for a lack of resources after a tough defeat. 

-Balanced units
Each type of unit serves their own distinct purposes, with infantry holding your front line, skirmishers covering your flanks as you march, cavalry raiding the enemy for supplies, and artillery providing fire support from afar. 

-Competent AI
The AI is no replacement for a human player, but is still enjoyable to play against. It will alter its defensive positions to react to your movements, charge undefended artillery and supplies, and outflank you if you leave gaps in your defense. 

-Variety of battles
Each of the dozens of individual battles require new strategies to win, new objectives to take, and new enemies to face, making it consistently entertaining and engaging to play. 

-Battle Progression
In a carry-over of one of the best features of UG: Gettysburg, UG: Civil War incorporates battle progression. Destroy the Union Army at the Hornet's Nest in Shiloh? You can expect to face little opposition as you march your forces towards Pittsburgh Landing later on in the battle. 

Cons
-Lack of multiplayer
As of this review, UG: Civil War does not incorporate multiplayer, although we can expect it soon, considering the existence of a rather enjoyable multiplayer option in UG: Gettysburg

-Static objectives
In a move that somewhat limits player freedom, victory on the battlefield is dependent upon the player securing certain objectives throughout the course of the battle. This means that if the game says you need to take a certain hill to win the battle, you need to take that hill or risk losing, regardless of other factors, such as the amount of casualties you deal towards your enemy. 
This is an unecessary feature, considering the existence of a better system in UG: Gettysburg (Holding key positions rewards ""victory points"" which ultimately factor into the outcome of a battle alongside casualties lost and dealt, but are unnecessary in order to win the battle itself). The replacement of these predetermined objectives would greatly enhance player freedom. 

Overall, most of the cons are easily fixable, considering that we have a working precedent with UG: Gettysburg.",1483074483,1483074922,True,6,0,0.566929101943969727,0,True,False,True

Cannon fire for long range seems to not have a good effect on enemy troops.

Though the game is in early access it is receiving frequent updates as it builds towards full release. From what I can tell the design team has done a good job in moulding the game as they've gone on. A lot of the issues I noticed in the Let's Play videos from early on have been rectified.

Having played a lot of turn-based strategy games set in the Civil War this was an interesting change in pace.

The Good:
- Maps are gorgeously designed, and quite close to the historical, as much as can be rendered on PC.
- Building your own army and leaders is much more rewarding than using the stock historical forces for each battle. This way you get to see your units advance and progress.
- The large variety of accurate period weapons for both sides gives a very historical feeling.
- If you like this era this is a very good campaign based progression of the war.

The Bad:
- Although a recent patch added consequences down the line for your previous victories, the battles are still railroaded. If the South won Shiloh, killing Grant and destroying his army, the war would have played out very differently. This isn't a major negative, but I wish there were more branching scenarios to more accurately make an alternate history.
- Possibly because it is Early Access, the game has a steep learning curve. My advice is to watch Let's Plays to get a feel for the game before playing. The 'tutorial' mission is perhaps the hardest one in the game because you are given a small force with no way of customising.
- Also due to Early Access I assume, there is a distinct lack of tooltips and relevant information. To find what you need you have to go to help, and even that is a little confusing.
- Some of the career abilities are practically useless, whilst some are simply essential. Army organisation and politics are so much more useful than any others, and some like medicine or logistics are almost useless compared. Again, will likely be balanced by full release.

The Wishlist:
I'm hoping when the game reaches full release that it will feature some other nice features.
- Uniform customisation for your units.
- A level of strategic planning rather than just replaying the historical path.
- Even more weapons.

Overall, a lot of fun if this historical era interests you. It is hard even on normal, so my suggestion is that your first campaign be at 'Colonel' difficulty if you're new to it.",1482994419,1482994419,True,1,0,0.49977487325668335,0,True,False,True

However, I very much enjoyed games like Supreme Commander and RUSE, so I thought I would give this one a solid try since it's one of my favorite periods of history both American and in the entire world.

I find that the game does offer some sort of realistic element that other games lack, however I feel the level of realism is at such a height sometimes that the game ceases to ofter both a challenge and be fun at the same time, even on easy mode. Perhaps, though, it's not so realistic, as I would often find myself outnumbering the enemy three to one in a charge and still find my men breaking and quaking in their boots at the sight of a measily 200 man division. The flanking system seems far too unbalanced in favor of the AI, although that point may be just me observing the negatives over the positives.

I think the campaign needs some work in terms of enemy scaling. I often found myself totally outnumbered and pitched in an unwinnable battle because the scaling mechanics figured my army organization was simply too high and that it needed to compensate, when in reality my army was measly because on average I would lose 30% of my army every battle because of how difficult every battle is, with the difficulty being artificial at that, which brings me to my next point.

For the love of all that is holy, remove the mission timers! Or at the very least, increase the time per mission exponentially! There is nothing more unrealistic and frustrating than having to force my troops up through the enemy lines, taking on massive losses, just to capture some stupid god damn church because the game tells me I have to do it in 15 minutes or I lose, or even worse, the time where I did capture the point but I had to hold it for 30 minutes, but I only had 17 left on the clock, and I still lost despite a clear victory in sight! You have no idea how frustrated I was.

Often the AI will make ridiculous manuevers and try to capture a point I'm defending and be utterly obliterated by artillery cannister fire and defending infantry, The joy of the game should be through the tactics and strategy that goes into carefully planning and executing every battle, but when it takes nearly and hour off of the four hours in total you have to complete your objective, it subverts the whole point of a well planned attack or defense and forces you to push through despite everything in the hope of victory.

There should be more balancing between the four main unit types. I find the calvary in this game to be far too underpowered and weak compared to the infantry, which to me seem to be walking blocks of tank that can shrug off almost anything. Skirmishers seem to do little of anything of note, depsite what the community made guides say, and the same goes for artillery, which I don't think they do much of anything to help. I would honestly love someone to point out some sort of tactic or button I'm missing to make any units besides the infantry to function better and actually be useful to my army.

I know this is early access still, so I'll let most of my frustration subside because of this fact and I'll hold out hope that the dev(s?) fix, patch, and expand to create on hell of a masterpeice.

I haven't had a chance to explore many of the new features yet, but after seeing how these guys tweaked and expanded UGG to perfection for what it was, I have no doubt this game will deliver 10x its value over the course of EA and after release. 

Here's to hoping for a Total War style campaign eventually, even if it's not in this game. Hit me up for some MP!",1479317810,1482889964,True,29,2,0.688250601291656494,1,True,False,True

and completing historical battles one after another. 

First of, let me just say this game is amazing. The A.I. makes good moves and does not go stupid until the very end when he got nothing else to loose. So far I`ve only really been defeated once, but many many times ive been hit to the point were I have to rebuild my army from the start. Giving me a major headache, loosing elite units and cav because he out manovers me. 

I got to ask the devolopers if they on purpose added the ""supply bait"".
I fel for it around 3 or 4 times before figuring out that its actually a bait. The AI will place the supplies in an open spot just in the beginning of the game. Then when I send cavalery or infantry after it, it will start pulling back. Always in just the perfect distance for me to get ambushed completley and loosing maybe 10-15% of a unit, some times even more.
At first I thought it was a coincidence, but it happens so very often, so now I just leave it be, trying to counter the ambush instead.

Other than that, the game is well polished. To be a early aplha game Im suprised its this well made. The units move in a nice way and interactions makes sense. Not all units can react to your commands right away, so often I see there is a little delay if a unit is in battle. 

So from my part I wish the Armoury would be a little better in order to know how many guns etc you go. Its a little clunky. Also maybe a % of veterans in a unit or a ""unit history"" so see were your glories troops have carried their banner. 

Havent managed to find anything thats completley over powered so far, everything seems kinda fair mostly.

If this game is to succed tho its going to need multiplayer. Its no going around it.
If im going to invest 100+ hours into this game its going to be because I can play against my friends.

This is a good game. It makes me want to watch the movie gettysburg right after. There are some annoying things with the game but it has been getting better. The devs are listening to user feedback and so far this game is amazing. I can't wait for it to be finished.

The good;
1: Insanly fun strategy game.
2: Historically accurate battles.
3:Graphics are decent (Looks like a game you would play on a IPAD) and runs smooth.

The so/so;
1: Early Access.
2: I wish there were more units on the ground
3:Still kinda buggy.

The Bad;
1: Unit scailing is a bit off. (Computer sometimes gets 3000 men per brigade and I think the max you can get is 2500)
2: I wish the carry over and campaign management effected the AI (like I completly wipe out unit A in a skirmish it shouldn't have 3000 men and the same General in the next battle)
3: Early Access lol.

All in all if you enjoy strategy games I can't recommend this game enough! 8/10 because of bugs and early access.",1482860744,1482860744,True,1,0,0.522471904754638672,0,True,False,True

Battles are what Total War should be. Not as aesthetically pleasing as TW, but the battles actually require thinking unlike TW were just smashing right into the AI who no matter how advance into the game always seem fond of their teir 1 peasant archers. One of the best strataegy games out right now. Great depth of detail in organizing your army from choosing brigades of Infantry, skirmishers, artillery, and calvary to form divisions and Corps. Statistics lovers like myself will enjoy the fact that you can view the battle history of each indiviual unit from battles fought and how many they killed and loss. 


This is the first game I've ever reviewed on Steam and I hope they continue to develop and finish this game right.
With that said here are a few thngs I hope get fleshed out as development continues:

The campaign is a linear, with finishing the battle unlocking 3 battles but only 1 battle being a ""major battle"" and advancing the stage.  The other two battles are optional but should be played because even a defeat will give you additionalr esources. However, other than the resources the battles dont seem to play any roll in the main battles. The will say something line ""A.P. Hill is threatenin the union right at Shiloh! Its up to you tio hold these crossroads and prevent the collapse of the Union's flank!"" (Totally made that up but you get the point). I'm not positive, but I don't think this will actually play into the main battle at all (I could be wrong though, I've only played 20 hours so far which was what it took me to play the availabe campaign so far ~5-7 major battles plus their side skirmishes).


As the top comment states, the AI army does increase in size as your army does when you modifie the army in the camp function. How ever, I do not believe its a direct 1-1 ratio. Meaning, if you spend your money and recruits to double the size or you army I dont think the opposing army will also double. I personally don't think this is a bad thing, otherwise the campaign could be over in basically a single battle if your effectively dystroy the AI army. Maybe a better fix would be having a fixed number of reinforcments for the Opposing army for each battle or even just a fixed number regardless of any previous battles.

Another additional item I would like to see would be divisional or corps commands, maybe even specific formations. As it stands now you have to order each unit indivually or select the units you want and draw a defensive line.



I know I pointed out more negatives than postives, but thats because the it would take me too long to higlight all the great things about this game and I've already played this game for like 20 hours on this Christmas day and I should probably use the last 4 hours left to spend time with my family.",1482721721,1482721721,True,8,0,0.57977062463760376,0,True,False,True

While it is far from perfect is does improve greatly on the smoothness and ease of use that its precusor Gettysburg had issues with. Most of the problems I have with the game are issues revolving around the overview of the campaign, and how each battle progresses to the next. While it does make some sense to make each progressive battle harder (From a gameplay stance) it does mean that your achievemnts do not feel as meaningfull. Destroying an elite enemy brigade only to have it come back stronger is no fun at all. 

On the positive, they have taken some steps to fix this, but it still feels as if the enemy is capable of replacing and increasing there entire army, while you must stretch your resources to match them. I feel that as the development progresses, this will be fleshed out, but until then it is my greatest annoyance.

As far as the actual in battle gameplay goes, I greatly enjoy it. While the individual brigades can do some stupid stuff, they overall do okay for themselves.
(Ill admit I have not at all experimented with the full AI control for a group of units, so I have no idea how good that works, or does not). The battles run very smoothly, and unless you deviate very far from the historical success of your army(AKA holding the first line at Shiloh and never having to retreat), the battles follow a pretty good pace.

Original Review:
This is a tough review due to wanting this game to succeed.

It is a fun game for short periods, but not recommended until campaign battles have long-term effects. As-is, all that matters is maintaining the size of your force rather than destroying the enemy or taking objectives.

In its current state the main draw of the game (campaign) is broken--it alternates between being too easy and placing you in frustrating situations due to buggy force ratios and inflexible battle scripting. Will adjust review if it's improved upon.

Started playing and couldn't stop. Campaign mode really sets the game apart and makes me care about the soldiers lives more. I would like an expasion of the perk system, maybe earned perks(traits) as well as selectable perks to further distinguish the various battalions.
The AI in general is very clever and provides an excellent challenge! The UI is clear and concise (total war esque) however at 4k res I would like ability to scale it up as I miss messages and distinguishing which regiments need attention during the 60 unit 100k aside battles is challenging.
My only gripe is that the enemy army scales to your best equipment which made me want to ""game"" the system and overall doesn't make sense (confederates having top of the line cannon and rifles for everyone).  While the union army was overal uniform it would be nice for the confederates to be able to mix equipment with the stats maybe averaging (except range) allowing units to progress as you capture better equipment. Waiting for 2000+ rifles of X variety is kind of a pain, and realistically troops could pick up a rifle and carry on.

The few reviewers who are frustrated with this game seem frustrated with either a) auto-scaling b) bugs c) difficulty. Let me express my opinion on these areas to help any of you still deciding whether to buy this.

[u]Auto-scaling[/u]
Auto-scaling is a necessity. (auto-scaling means that if you add more troops to armies you use in a particular battle, the game will add troops to the enemy armies in that particular battle). This helps make each battle closely contested rather than one-sided. 

I have two methods to deal with this successfully. It's just one of many things about UG that makes you think.

[u]Bugs[/u]
I've encountered a few minor bugs, but they have not presented big problems. For example, my cavalry occasionally gets stuck on the edge of the board. Usually I can force them to move with one of the two movement methods, but not both.

Occasionally, my troops will make an unexpected movement that seems contrary to my orders. This does not happen often though. And considering the calamity and chaos of the battles, mis-communication between commanders and troops is perhaps a touch of realism. 

[u]Difficulty[/u]
Yes, it's difficult, but in a good way. I'm playing on the easy level and I still have to restart about 1/3 of the battles multiple times to achieve victory. I have been able to achieve victory in all the battles so far, except for one where I accepted a draw. At least to me, I think it's an almost perfect balance. Whether I win or lose depends on the quality of my decision-making. The difference between winning and losing is placement of my troops, taking advantage of terrain and environment, coordinating my efforts, choosing the right mix of troops, flanking and not getting flanked, etc.

The AI is good enough that these decisions are continual, flow during the course of battle, involve explicit tradeoffs, are different even when I replay the same battle, and so on. Perhaps if I were a better general, or a war historian, I could play this game on a higher difficulty level. Perhaps if I didn't have years of experience with other strategy games like the Civ Series, Total War series, and others, then this game would be too difficult. For me though, the difficulty makes it very rewarding when I manage to win a battle.

So if you're still reading, you really should give UG a try. I have no affiliation whatsoever with the company, nor did I receive it for free. I just happen to think it's one of the best games I've played in years.",1482191934,1482191934,True,5,0,0.584855973720550537,1,True,False,True

The decisions you make are meaningful tactically and strategically. You are constantly concerned with giving your units combat experience to develop elite units while protecting your fighting capabilities for future engagements while achieving enouhg battlefield success so the politicians don't fire you.

For now however, the decisions are somewhat directionless in campaign mode as there is no end-state other than getting fired.

I am not joking, this game is how RTS's should be made, and given some development, I could see this even getting into tactical RTS E-Sports. Imagine using a reource pool per battle to setup your Army and go head to head with another player or a group of players in a grand battle, this game can easily do this!

Even from a singleplayer point of view this game is slated to be a masterpiece, and in an era that is not that popular for gaming. Some serious time, research, and development went into this game, and it shows. This game is currently in Early Access as of this review, and it already plays better than many completed and patched games, this RTS game is on the fast track for deserving the RTS GOTY award.


But what about dem graphics, I have seen much better in older games?

Sure its not the most visually appealing like Halo Wars 2, but its most certainly not ugly and the graphics are functional and unique.

Absolutely outstanding game so far.  Even though it's in early access I've only encountered one serious bug and it wasn't in any way game breaking (got a defeat for a skirmish when I had fulfilled the victory conditions).  I played through the currently available Union campaign missions in around 20 hours, including a few battle do-overs when I goofed.  Combat is simple to pick up but still fairly in-depth.  

I love the army management between battles, which is something I've missed since the old Sierra Games' Robert E Lee Civil War General series.  It's very well done.  By carefully hoarding my men and avoiding messy defeats in 1st & 2nd Bull Run and the Peninsula campaign I was able to outnumber Lee 2:1 at Antietam, where I crushed him outright.  

There are a few minor features I'd like to see added for flavor and depth, but to be honest the game is pretty much mechanically complete.

Game Pros:
> Lets you micro-manage the development of one's army. 
> Unlike a turn based game (like Civil War Generals 2), the continued changing dynamics on the battlefield make it so each battle is pretty unique in its interation with the AI

Game Cons/Could Improve:
> The graphics were on the lower end. Zooming in didn't really enhance the fighting/graphics as it ddin't zoom in that much frankly.
> The storyline is fixed. In Civil War Generals 2, the outcome of a battle determined the next battle. Here that's not really the case. I would love if alternate-history battles/timelines were developed. Granted, the developer seems to already have a projected set list of battles to develop and any additional ones may be impractical. 
> The AI itself coudl use some improvement. I'm often able to use a small skirmishing force to hold up significantly larger AI military forces up from accomplishing their objectives or engaging in the larger battlefronts. The AI should be more aggressive when in the face of easy obstacles.

It seems to have regular updates and beta testing phases and also includes a rather novel in-game bug reporter so I'm confident that problems can be solved given time.

The game itself also has an interesting scope and scale to it. On several occassions I've finished some battle and looked back at the battlefield and just had a DAAAMN thought looking at the several thousand casualties that have just happened. It just manages to nail that sweet spot between the numbers being awesomely high enough for serious strategy (biggest battle for me so far had some 100,000 troops) but just low enough to get some sense of espirit-des-corps amongst your general and his army - when you've just fought the Battle of Bull Run and won but taken some 40% casualties amongst your brigade and lost several officers who've fought with you in a few battles you do feel a sense of pride and regret.

The AI (specifically your brigades) are prone to either deciding not to follow orders (i.e. stopping or falling back when told to move up through open terrain even when not routed or in contact with the enemy) additionally and somewhat more problematic at times is they will rotate out of position often into tactically disadvantageous positions to them.

After buying it I basically did nothing else for the entire weekend and palyed about 30 hours within 2 days. The graphics, while not unbelievable, are suitably immersive and suit the overall flavor of the game very well. The sound design has some room for improvement. The AI plays well, using differnt tactics and positioning each time you play even druing the same mission, lending to replayaility. Leveling and experience are fun and exciting - if a bit unclear as to what stats practically do what. Overall, it's a great game that I see myself playing a lot in the near future, and eagerly await more content. While the game is currently early access I haven't run into any actual bugs or crashes. It feels very polished and plays like a dream. The only improvements I'd make would be minor gameplay tweaks and a little more instruction / help and story. Other than that, it plays far better than many games released by major studios as ""finished"". Well done.

Pros:

-Realistic historical battles are fun to play through as both sides, and trying different tactics each time is rewarding
-Leveling, experience system is great, leaving you feeling as if you really are progressing and growing in veterancy over time.
-The AI is challenging and far better than many other AIs
-The game mechanics are pretty easy to understand after a few battles, and lend themselves to using lots of strategy, especially cover and positioning.


Cons:

-Cavalry (And skirmirshers as well) seems underpowered and only good for chasing down routing units, which often recompose before the cavalry can reach them and unleash a volley back at the cavalry which in turn routs your cavalry. It would be cool to see better playable tactics for cavalry, like more devastating charges or more ability to kite the enemy. As it stands I rarely find use for cavalry except capturing enemy supply and charging artillery from behind - and even this is often really risky for the cavalry. It just seems like it's rarely worth having a cavalry brigade compared to another infantry brigade.
-Supply is a good mechanic, but in some battles or portions of battles you begin without a supply cart, so no matter how much you spend on it, it seems like at times it just depends on how the program decides to split your units up
-The sound design for the camp screen has sounds at different volumes and of different quality leading to a somewhat inconsistent feel
-Sometimes objectives are a little unclear, and the map is too zoomed in to see what is where. Additionally, the timers are a little confusing - it would be cool to have more clarity as to what will happen when.
-It's a bit difficult to tell exactly what upgrade to pick in some cases. One example is two upgrades for tier 2 of infantry, one offers -10 reload +10 accuracy, the other ofers +10reload -10 accuracy or something like that. There is no explanation, nor is there any sense of which bonus is better and I can't imagine how you might begin to test this. 

I know I listed more cons than pros, but overall this is still one of the best war games I've ever played. It feels in some ways like a cross between Total War and Blitzkreig/Company of Heroes, where both the overall management as well as the tactics and postioning of units really do matter.

Suggestions

-Audio for distant parts of the battlefield should be more muted than nearby parts.
-""Traits"" gained for commanders, both good and bad. Examples could be alchoholism, cruel, inspiring, fearless, etc. It would be awesome to have direct feedback during a battle that your actions have earned you a trait of ""fearless"" for fighting against superior numbers, or something like that. Additionally, if you dawdle too long you could earn ""hestitant"" and that would give you some penalties (or bonuses) in following battles. 
-Level-up notice in-battle. It would be cool if your units were leveled-up mid-battle, with a sound and notification on the map as well.
-Story snippets. It would be awesome if there was an overal storyline from one or a few of the soldiers fighting under your command, including letter to his family, descriptions of the food and conditions, his thoughts and fears - much like in the Ken Burns documentary the Civil War. I think that would really add a human element and more of a personal story to the overall game story ark,
-Abilities for commanders. It would be cool if your division commanders (which are nowhere to be found on the battlefield until you suddenly realize they have been wounded somehow) and generals could issue commands like ""stand your ground"" giving a morale bonus or ""forced march"" giving a temporary speed bonus.
-Ability to ""fall back"" in a specific direction. Often units giving the fall back order will head off in a random direction rather than towards a more defensible position or to your other units. The same goes for routing units - I understand there should be chaos when units get routed, but they shouldn't run TOWARDS the enemy at least. 
-Increasing routing distances. If a unit gets routed and routed over and over, it seems like it would lose more long-term morale and rout farther each consecutive time. This would let you feel as if you're making progress when holding on area against many enemies, and would urge a little more caution when you're attacking.
-Artillery rarely seems to kill its weight in enemies. Perhaps a morale shock bonus when a volley accurately hits an exposed unit. Additionally, I don't think artillery shots should count as ""flanking"" - it feels frustrating to get flanked by artillery shots which do the same damage no matter which side they come from
-Post-battle grades. It woud be great to see post-battle grades based on casualties lost, damage incurred, experience gained, etc. Specifically, the grand battles where there are multiple objective and in some cases you can even beat the battle early and totally skip an entire day / phase of battle - it should say something. Even simply saying, for example, dominant victory vs strong victory vs slim victory  vs phyrric victory, etc. Additionally, ""bonus"" objectives with rewards would be pretty cool. Having the chance to rescue an experienced but encircled general and add him to your team, or grab a supply cache of good weapons, etc could add replay value. Also, If you go out of your way to kill extra enemy units, it should reward you as well with fewer enemies in the subsequent battle (maybe just for the next battle). This would help offset the extra cost to replenish your units.
-More historical bonuses and penalties for each faction. For example, more supplies, weapons, and troops for the North. More veteran generals, food, and morale for the South. If these bonuses already exist, perhaps make note of that somewhere, like at the beginning when you choose North or South.

Anyway, yeah it's a great game!

Finally, an RTS that cares about elevation, movement and supply. You're rewarded by slowly flanking and pressing, using cover smartly, and setting up zones of fire. Rush ahead and get gunned down in droves; think and you'll probably still get gunned down, but at least you know what you're doing.

With Total War slowly sliding into DLC-mongering and a steady drop of quality in every release since Shogun 2, Gettysburg was a little ray of hope for us real time tactical fans. Though punishing, Gettysburg was always fair. Any poor situation you got yourself in was squarely your own fault- Not that tweaks to the mechanics didn't strongly favor the Union in the last few months of its life-cycle.

This game doesn't do that. A good deal of the scenarios feel more like puzzle game riddles- Something to replay over and over again until you solve them. The dev-created (nonhistorical) scenarios especially feature such wonderful additions as enemy reinforcements arriving on the flanks or rear of engaged armies. Historical battles are just as hard, simply because you're either massively outnumbered and defending or slightly outnumbered and attacking.

I was incredibly dismayed to learn that the enemy force scales with yours. Rather than, say, being rewarded for decisive, crushing victories by slowly weakening the armies you fight, you instead find yourself facing waves upon waves of brain-dead AI zombies who can't do anything but zerg rush or hold to their trenches uselessly because you've outflanked them and it can't seem to drum up enough basic understanding to shift its line away from the now-obsolete defenses. This game is a step down from Gettysburg in every respect except scale- Infantry units mimic the Fall of the Samurai ""Tosa Shuffle"" by slowly sliding out of their positions. Attacking forces, instead of firing, require pristine micromanagment to ensure they don't simply march in parade formations to hapless demises against enemy trenches. What was an occasional targeting bug in Gettysburg has now become endemic as your men ignore the people shooting them to fire at enemies you're pretty sure they shouldn't be able to see.

The enemy scaling to your army also presents a problem in that it renders anything in the camp except replacing dead or wounded commanders superfluous and encourages lazy cheese by way of playing battles in an indecisive way- Something that the best Civil War commanders didn't do. Lee and Grant were both known for having KO-oriented styles to use boxing match terminology, but this game punishes you for visions of decisive tactical outcomes.

Also, the supply system doesn't work. Get rid of it. I was excited about it initially, but it literally does nothing. Your men keep firing infinitely after their ammo runs out. I'm surprised this was not pointed out earlier.",1481344425,1481344425,False,13,0,0.532031416893005371,4,True,False,True

 By no means is it perfect. In realism of battlefield conditions/command and control (fog of war), In realism of Campigns (pre-set scenarios). They are designed very well, and the look and feel of the game seems immerse you in historic conflicts.
In some ways it's like an rpg, in that you define your characteristics and attributes as a general, then your brigades and divisions and or corps prior to entering the campaign (after your first battle). Economic aspects, budgeting resources and purchases. It is a very involved and complex game which must have taken a corresponding amount of thought in it's mechanics and art to produce. 

I highly reccomend it, at $30 it's a steal.

So ends my review, now my wish list. 
On a long march the ability to allow the AI to march (in collum)  your troops along the fastest path (not as the crow flies).
Supply wagons for each division, as well as purchasing supply per division prior to deployments.
Better scouting of terrain prior to deployment, and that could reflect the regions loyalties.... meaning in MD. it would be neutral, in PA it would be Pro Union, and of course in the south Pro Condederacy.

Lastly, as I've not played through the campaign yet, so this may not be an issue. The overall condition of the Confederacy should be reflected in it's victories, so if battles are won that were in history lost, your army and what's available to it should correspondingly reflect that success. At least in the south, moral and supply would be greatly increased, while in the north it may not be as significant a difference. 

Ok that's it!

Learning curve is fairly high if you don't want massive casulties and your troops running around like chickens with thier heads cut off.  I started the game on the easier setting and it ask me several questions to mold my army, which as far as I can tell does absolutely nothing for the gameplay.  Second, artillery appears worthless.  I flanked and wiped out 140 artillery and left there 1500 troops without support.  My 100 artillary and 900 men behind fortifications did very little to it until their 2500 reinforcements arrived and out flanked my bridge.  Next, campaign is a joke.

Blows Total War out of the water for tactics and AI challenge. This is a serious classic of the computer wargame genre. You can finish a single battle in 30 mins, or be gripped by a campaign for days.

+ handdrawn wonderful graphics which is very stunning.
+ morale & fatique for units

   adds a campaign system and a meaning to the battles.


- No multiplayer co-op  (also was left out in UG:Ghettysburg,hopefully the devs will understand 
   this is people really   missed in their first game and will add later on)

- Weird teleporting, 
If you skip the info in a battle enemy uits will seemingly be teleporting right in front of you without you having any
possibility to pull back your units, extremly annoying and weird design idea. I first noticed it in "" 1st bullrun"". I was so completely turned off by this that I just exited the game.  

-No clear interface in campaign  ( Quite personal opinion)

Maps and units look really good, wide array of weaponry and unit types are avaliable and the UI both in battle and in the army management screen are really well designed and easy to use. The game can be challenging at times but thats part of the fun, when you win a hard fought battle you really feel as if you've actually achieved something. The main grand/historcial battles can easily see more than 100k+ troops on the field and it really gives a sense of how epic these battles were. 

The only downsides are the lack of a proper tutourial although there is an advisor thats goes somewhat in dealing with this issue, and the first mission in both campaigns sort of serves as an ad hoc tutourial. Also as of the time of writing this review there is no multiplayer but there is talk of it possibly being added in at a later date along with more custom battles. Of course this game is still in early access so this can be corrected in time and while i have encountered very few bugs and no crashes it is worth bearing in mind that they can happen in an early access game.

In short I would give this game 8.5/10 and it is a must buy for any strategy or history fan out there, and especially for those of you who have played Ultimate General Gettysburg.

* Loved the original Ulitmate General Gettysburg. The interface is really intuitive and the graphics are just godo enough to be immersive, and just simple enough not to strain my machine. Not Total War level, but enoguh that you get a feel of moving brigades across the battlefield.
* New campaign version, and more battles, really expands the replayability. I played a LOT of Gettysburg and I expect I will play even more of this game.
*Customizeable army, officers, gaining experience, and re equiping weapons all remind me of Sierra's old Robert E. Lee Civil War General, a game I loved. I think the different stats and role of officers (which now seem like largely placeholders) could use a bit of tweaking around the edges, but I really like where the design is going.

Cons
* The AI isn't too bright and the main difficulty modifier seems to be ""The computer gets more stuff."" I have heard that programming good AI is hard, but I think it would be easy to offer some different variations. Is there any way to collect player data on how players play/win the different maps and perhaps allow the AI to adjust? I know I personally gimmick the heck out of going through woods on a narrow frontage in strength to avoid artillary fire and get close to the objective while avoiding keeping up any sort of pretense of a line. If the computer probed more, and responded to where I was, he could punish me for these sorts of tactics (or at least provide an effective counter.) This is particularly an issue compared to Gettysburg, as if I am on the offensive, unlike in Gettysburg, I don't have any objectives of my own to worry about meaning my tactics can be more unorthodox.

""Needs Work""

These are a few items that bother me, but are not worth putting under ""con"" as the game is still in progress.

*The campaign mode needs a lot of tweaks to make it competitive and engaging. Some skills are inherently more useful than others (with some, like army organization being essential) making choices seem less meaningful. There is not many successful routes of skill placements that really result in diffreent interesting ways to be a general. So I'd recommend taking out ""necessary skills (like army org) and simply hardwrite those changes to occur in the course of the campaign and perhaps add new ones (say, infantry specialist/artillary specialist etc) that suggest different strategies.
*The campaign mode also doesn't have much in the way of meaningful or interesting variation/decisions regarding battle choice. While the meat and potatoes of the game is the battlefield command, it'd be nice if choices mattered on teh campaign level. Examples of this include how the ""Wargame"" series in both European Escalation and Red Dragon had a Total War style map where you moved your subcomponent units around. The old Close Combad A Bridge Too Far series had different operations and sectors, sucess in which impacted your performance in other areas. This would be easy to copy here with perhaps Northern Virginia, the Missippi and... for a fun expansion... the west (smaller skirmashes and battles). Perhaps, for example, if you keep the Missippi open you get access to more weapons or different resources.
* Could use some proofreading and editing on some of the battle descriptions and text.


To Sum up:
* Great war game built on solid fundamentals, keeping the magic of the original game. New featuers expand the replayablitiy and tactical challenges. AI still needs work, and the new campaign mode could use tweaking, but incredibly fun as is, and (given the support the company gave to Ulitimate General Gettysburg) likely to get much better.

I think this game is awesome. I played many hours on Ultimate General: Gettysburg, and while that was fun, I was always a bit annoyed that I would have many units I felt to be subpar, or was disaapointed that there wasn't more battles to be fought. This game was an answer to a question I asked many times. When would there be a comprehensive ACW game that allowed for you to command, fight, and outfit your armies? 

This game does a good job of being true to the historical truths of the American Civil War, as the Confederates have access to more officers, who are typically more effective than thier Union counterparts. That said, the Confederates have access to far less quality equipment as the Union, and must spend more to outfit their units, and may run into a shortage of higher quality armaments. Thier troops are usually better and can stand longer in a battle, unless flanked and being raked with cannon fire. You have to try and be wise with your units, and use then to best advantage, but sometimes you don't have a choice, or a brilliant plan in concept draws in too many brigades and you find three Union brigades sweeping in from the left, your right flank is being savaged by a renewed cannon fussilade, and the center is overextended and you are under threat of being cut off and defeated in detail. It's moments like those one must tip their cap to the AI and hit a restart. My last battle of Antietam as the Confederacy, cost me over 60% of my force, over 38,000 casualties, and even the 63,000 I inflicted in return was little solace to the fact that even my elite units were in tatters all over the Maryland countryside. Like Lee, my command had held the field, barely...

As the Union, one can count on recieving plentiful access to weapons and get a larger number of rifles or cannons from the government in Washington D.C., and you can mop the floor with many opposing smaller and less equiped Confederate brigades. I'd say the bonus the Union gets in access to cannons is a boost for them, but not even that can stop the Stonewall Brigade from sweeping you off a hill and D.H. Hill's Division sweeping your units from the valley as they retreat and attempt to reform. The Union soldier, unless in one of the elite brigades, has a tendency to be less enthused, and therefore their charges are less effective, but they come in great waves though. 

All said, this game is great. I would have to say, I am not always happy with the scaling between armies, if I am careful and has husbanded many of the units to be evenly matched when Gettysburg comes around, I want that to be reflected. I give this game a 8.5/10, and since most of the gripe is that they need to hurry up with the rest, this game is for anyone who likes a combination, RPG/tactical command/historical immersion.",1480772785,1480772785,True,2,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

How nice to know they were still at work and have expanded this excellent title. I made an early purchase of U.G. Civil War because I believe these folks deserve support, and the early version is offered in a very playable form, though not yet completed. It is a steal at the offered price.

The interface in this software is cleverly and efficiently designed, and like nothing else i""ve played. It renders full immersion into the real-time play without requiring excessive micro-management. The tactical options and troop behavior and response tends to force the battle style of the period, keeping you honest without making things feel restrained.

A.I. is very good at this stage. I have tested by playing the first scenario from both sides, under the same medium settings. I was able to achieve victory from each side but niether was a walk in the park. I suspect that playing under the highest difficulty settings would be a serious challenge, with no certain outcome. I also suspect that playing the campaign mode will add even more challenges.

Without getting too detailed I would just like to say that this is one of the most enjoyable game interfaces I have ever experienced (and I go back to the Commodore 64 days).

However I saw the potential of enjoyment in this game and watched a few videos and picked it up. I am by no means an expert on the civil war nor have I done any reasearch outside of a classroom enviroment into the civil war and any of its battles. This has changed due to the amount of enjoyment I have gotten out of this game. I normally don't trust video games in early access due to the two incidents of developers never finishing their games, but seeing that this game is fairly well polished I can safely say that in a few months this will be a game where I can spend 6-7 hours in one sitting. Currently, however, I cannot-and now let us segway(segwey?) into the pro's and con's.

Pros:
-Great Graphics that works with the gameplay
-Rewarding battle experience
-Realism in fighting (you don't just fight to the death due to units running from moral)
-Cav are strategic units only, unlike a few games where they are mostly used as a main fighting unit
-The amount of unit customization and how a certain unit can be completely different than another
-Unit progression sytem
And a wide range more

Cons:
-Abysmal AI-I'm talking that when you right click to attack an enemy they will go in to melee, even with fully reloaded guns and full supply
-Abysmal AI Pt.2-The lack of control seems realistic I guess but in a gameplay aspect it pisses me off to no fucking end., For example, you're waiting for like 10 minutes just for some of your units to respond to an order (move up, stop moving into 20k enemy troops, stop FUCKING GOING THERE CAV, ect)
-AI in general seems broken-AI usually is shit for the player, however sometimes enemy units will just stand there watching you for half the battle as their men slowly become  full with lead. This also happens with your units as well, even when given a command to attack the enemy right infront of them, being fully reloaded and near full supply, they sometimes just stand there in the idle animation state not even raising their weapons (and no, they were not on hold or halt fire)


In conclusion, this game got me interested in learning more about the Civil War, something which games rarely make me want to do. The game is fun until the major battles (Shiloh, Antietam, Bull Run 2), as it becomes very apparent at how shit the AI can be.

I can only hope for a UG: Napoleon, or and please please allow us to move troops before the individual battles. I really like your scenarios, but if you could SOMEHOW do something that would allow for a campaign metagame (rather than just logistics management - which is still awesome) I'd be on board in a minute.


That said, I've still never had as much fun fighting scenario style battles as I did here. It was like a watered-down Close Combat in Civil War, but something about the ease of the game just invites replaying. It's simple, and yet complex at the very same time.

I'll give those a snippet of what this game enables you to do... I was trying to attack a strongly held enemy position. I had minimal cannons (less than half of what the enemy had, and a mixture of long/short range heavy cannon/howitzers) and 3/4th as much infantry, not only that but the enemy would get reinforcements BEFORE my reinforcements (which would have ensured I had as many cannon - though they were all light cannon) the rest of my infantry and my light infantry/cav.

I worried that if I waited before moving my divisions into combat, that the enemy would reinforce it's far superior position and I'd take MASSIVE casualties before the NEXT battle. (Meta-logistics is important, even though you don't decide the location of the battles or the general overall strategy, you still must adapt tactically and use the logistics as your strategy for the game.) So, I did what I was reluctuant to do, and I forced my infantry ahead, planning to take more losses now, for less losses later, and ideally force an opening in the enemy line. 

What I did not account for however, were the one AI cav and Skirmisher brigade that came out to meet my forces, showing my positions to enemy cannon. It started, 60+ cannon firing on my lines, long long before I had planned to get into combat range. If I run to cover, my troops would be exhausted very quickly. If I let them march, they'll take unknown losses before I drive the enemy cav/skirm out of the way. 

I hadn't brought skirm/cav with me, leaving them in my reinforcement corps (because I figured they'd have to move quickly, I gave them most of my light cannon and infantry/cav and only about 7500 infantry). I immediately detached (like I should have done earlier! my captains berated me endlessly!) light companies from my infantry regiments, and proceeded to secure my flanks and forward positions so my units wouldn't be under fire for ten minutes before engaging themselves - which as I found out earlier has more of an impact on MORALE then straight losses, but you NEED that morale to maintain combat, and will lose badly in a fight with low morale. 

Lo and behold the enemy cav were trying to flank me again, I used two light companies to pin them just outside of the woods, and pounded them with my cannon until they broke and routed off the map (cav take heavy losses from certain cannon when in the open). That enabled me to flank the same approach the enemy did, and I spotted their advance positions. My light company commanders failed to obey my orders, and for some reason charged the enemy with their combined 750 men along a narrow front against approximately 14,000 infantry. Incredibly one company managed to get into melee range before routing, and my remaining 200 troops (from 3 different light companies) were falling back to the woods they never should have left. Yet the infantry that had been engaged in melee (maybe around 6000 troops) pulled out of their fortifications and charged after that last 200 troops, who obeyed orders and ran to an open field where they were slaughtered to the man. Yet, those 6000 troops now found themselves facing 12,000 infantry in heavy forests between them and their previous positions. The battle was short. They routed, and my nearly untouched force proceeded to surround and hammer one flank of the enemy position, pulling troops off the line from their center. 

That was the opportunity I was waiting for, my heavy cannon started pounding the two closest batteries near the center, while an additional 15,000 infantry of mine wedged themselves in the middle of the enemy position, splitting their still more numerous forces in two. I disengaged my flanking attack (with approximately 10,000 remaining troops from a losing battle - advancing in open ground against minimal forces in fortifications can be painful) and let them rest, which caused the enemy to pull about 4/5ths of the forces in that position to support their counter attack against my center wedge. This way the third and last opportunity the enemy gave me that I seized. I had one reserve brigade, and with relish I ordered them into the breach. 

These boys were led by Stonewall jackson himself, and were equipped with the best melee rifles I could afford, this one regiment was my ""door knocker"", I knew that ANYtime I got them into melee with an enemy they would win, but I had never put them against equal (still) numbers in a fortification. Stonewall led them himself up the hill, and through a massive wave he engaged the enemy. Of his 2000 troops, he lost 500 quickly, then another 200... but then the other brigades that were exhausted got into range and unleashed their vollies. The enemy broke. Jackson led his regiment (before being wounded in a melee several hours later) down the line and turned enemy position one at a time. By the time my reinforcements (and the enemies) arrived, my army of nearly 30,000 men was down to around 20,000  but I had captured or destroyed nearly 40,000 infantry, cannon, and cavalry. With my reinforcements on the scene, I quickly isolated and captured an additional 15,000 troops.

Victory!

(Note, this battle happened prior to the rescale of troops on the medium difficulty, I understand these number differentials are quite different now.)  - My battle was in total (between my two corps) around 45,000 troops, with 120 guns, while the enemy had 150 cannon (mostly all already in place) and maybe 60,000 enemy troops.",1480594895,1480594895,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

Lack of troop variety was a big issue, and the limited nature of just fighting Gettysburg was frustrating, seeing as I could tell the basic features of the game would lead to fantastic gameplay. 

Of course, that's exactly where Ultimate General: Civil War comes in. This game features, not only additional Historical Battles ala Gettysburg, but it also features a campaign that is, frankly, extremely fun. The best part about the campaign is not only does it allow you to participate in a variety of historical battles and minor skirmishes, but all while managing and controlling your own army serving either the United States or the Confederate States. Both sides get different equipment and while I haven't noticed a significant difference overall, it does alter playstyles slightly. For instance, the USA gets Palmetto M1842 Muskets, while the CSA gets quite a few Missisippi Rifles. The USA gets more sharps carbines while the CSA gets Hunter rifles. 

The battles are quite challening on the normal difficulty, and the game really punishes you in the long term if you can't manage your men/weapons. You need to learn how to minimize losses by flanking, deploying skirmishes, using your cannons, etc. Its quite challening to manage an entire battlefield with tens of thousands of soldiers often times. Luckily the smaller battles are usually shorter and more manageable. 

I think the best thing about Ultimate General: Civil War is that its a rare gem in the dying RTS/RTT genre. I haven't had a Real Time Strategy game that I've put these many hours into probably since... well since Ultimate General: Gettysburg to be completely honest. I love the Civil War, I love the army management system, where each brigade of soldiers is unique with their own individual stats, equipment, etc (something sorely lacking in Gettysburg).

+the campagin is lots of fun if at times frustratingly difficult
+graphically its vibrant and fun
+ campagin allows for different playstyles, although some are much more effective than others, and encourages replayability through this


- Supply Wagons have a tendency to wander and become captured unless you micro manage them, this single event can ruin a battle 
- having only 1 supply wagon per-division is frustating at times
- not being able to choose the brigades you want when the mission allows less brigades than you have is irritating, and at times tacitcally upsetting
- having brigades wander out of cover so they can continue to fire at a fleeing enemy is infuriating, yes there is a halt/hold command but even then they dont always stay in place
- the tendency to be outnumbered 2-1 in campagin battles is odd because rarely at the normal difficulty will the AI take advantage and wipe you out
- brigades sometimes switch from my selected target to a different target opening themselves up to flanking fire and then routing...
- Cannons seem a little too useless at range and a little too devestating up close, artillery almost always ends my games with the most kills by a wide margin
- Skirmishers, unless kitted out with top end rifles, seem hardly worth taking over a full strength infantry brigade who can create skirmishers once in battle

Its worth the price in its current form, but you will at times be frustrated that a single AI mistake in a multi part battle can set you back a few hours or potentially ruin your campaign. I have high hopes that some of the AI issues will be sorted, but even if they dont you'll have plenty of fun.

This is hours of fun and even if the final campign is linear there is good scope for replayability.

The major drawback as I see it is the desire to make the title accessible on a touchscreen pad. I wonder what is cut from the product in order to try and grab a piece of this other market pie.

The most exiting aspect for this game is that the battle simulation is solid and very workable. I would love to see a strategic map with continental US where you manage resources and move armys. The possibilitys with a future title with this in mind would be awsome.

Building and fighting ships would also be very interesting also. You do see a couple in the first mission and id be interested to see if this could be expanded upon.

Pros.
-Well done battles.

-Functional if basic interface (you have to toggle to see the two sets of information on a unit which should be displayed together!!)

-Progression for your general with skills. (Also all other officers progress and have skills)

Cons
-Linear campign

-Tablet imposed graphics limitations

- No visual difference between units (As far as I can see all types of cannon look the same from a 6pdr to a 20pdr parrot rifled cannon)

- If you win a battle just meet objectives VS doing that and slaughtering the enemy there is no disernable effect on enemy troop numbers in the next battle. You only get a quantity of captured weapons

I just finished spending 4 and a half hours fighting the battle of Shiloh as the Union. The battle ended in a Draw, as I wasnt fast enough at capturing the ending objectives in the final phase.

Holy Cow. This game has me glued to my chair. 

So the game is amazing if you like a specific kind of tactical gameplay, which it excels at marvelously. 

Watching my veteran divisions fight off wave after wave of confederates, running down on men, then on ammo, then almost all of them getting exhausted, it was epic. I felt like I was playing as Kind Leonidas fending off 1 million persians with 300 spartans. 

In the end though, the Rebs lost 30,000+ troops, to my 10,000... meaning I took 30 - 40% casualties. I even lost 3 tier 2 brigades that I have had since the beginning of the game. 

Anyway I can completely understand why some people can't beat that level. Literally just my physical exhaustion for playing the whole thing without a break is a challenge. 

In the end though, I guess my playthrough of Shiloh ended a bit more like the battle of Antietam, heavy casualties for both sides without a true winner. Enter the meatgrinder of the civil war, command and manage massive armies (I mean MASSIVE, like no other game out there has armies this big! and when I say ""armies"", I literally mean a Field Army in the literal sense, that has several Army corps, each numbering in the 10,000's of troops, comprised of 3 - 5 divisions, each with 3 - 5 brigades!)

After having played it for a couple hours and gone from enjoying it to being deeply frustrated I find myself agreeing with him. So keep in mind that while I haven't put forty hours into the game, I don't believe that it offers much more variety the further in you go.

The Good:

- The Visuals: While not ultra realistic 3D, they're nice enough. I enjoyed the kind of old school style they've got going and it reminded me of a couple Civil War games I played when I was a kid. The maps are simple, but it's pretty clear what the different kinds of terrain are supposed to be.

- Progression: The progression elements (sort of). The ability to equip your different units with a variety of historical weapons was a nice feature, and the skill bonuses that you can add as a unit gains in veterancy give you the ability to customize yur play style without being overly complicated.

- Consequences: Permanent consequences for your units give you a feeling that your tactical decisions matter - to an extent. While you can replenish your troops with veterans following a particularly costly battle, I can see money getting tight as you get further into the game. Admittedly this is a portion that I didn't experience fully, but it's pretty clear what can happen if you toss your veteran units into the grinder every mission.

The Bad:

- Controls: The biggest problem with the game. Your units will rarely follow your orders to move or shoot at distant enemies, choosing instead to fire on enemies in close range. When they do decide to move, they do so in a way that frequently results in them being shot in the flanks or even the rear. Melee detection is spotty at best, and get used to having troops so exhausted that they can't charge or fight effectively. It's very easy to accidentaly use the battle-line drag tool, which will result in being flanked again. Skirmishers shoot and move, which could be useful except they run away from the enemy the fire at (even if they're outside that enemy's fire arc) which leads tho them being - you guessed it! - fired on in the flank or rear. Considering the progression and carry-through mechanics, this causes permanent damage to your campaing experience. In my opinion, this is what leads to the game not being fun.

- Difficulty: The enemy always has more men than you. This is a constant, you'll have to get used to it if you decide to play past the tutorial. They also have more units than you, at least in the missions I completed. You'll end up getting swarmed and there's not much you can do about it besides weather the storm. It means you don't get to go on the offensive very often, and when you do you're likely to get cut off and destroyed.

- Map Information: There appears to be some form of elevation system in place - or at least cannons seem affected - but I didn't see any way to display that information in-game. Similarly, the only way to see the cover values is to watch a unit as it travels over land. This makes it hard to do much more than eyeball things and some light forests don't supply as much cover as you might expect. It is possible that I missed an option to display that during values, so keep that in mind.

- Map Objects: A lot of things on the map don't function as you'd expect. This ties into the last point, but there's no option to have your troops hunker down behind a stone wall or wooden fence. Considering how many of these terrain features were important during the actual Civil War, this feels like an unfortunate oversight. Things like fields offer cover when they should probably only obscure sight lines.

- Battle Advice: Don't follow it, it's terrible. The advisor will tell you to take forward positions to delay the enemy - this is suicide, givent hat the enemy will normally outnumber you by about 1.5X your unit count. Delay the enemy with a unit of skirmishers? Get hit with three infantry squares and a cannon. Hold outside the town waiting for reinforcements? Nope, the enemy circled behind you with as many men as you'll have *with* reinforcements and claimed the town. The best option is always to turtle.

In summary, I think this game has some good ideas but the execution was shoddy. A strategy game, especially one with such a large difficulty handicap for the enemy, isn't fun for me if I can't command my troops effectively. Overcoming long odds can be an enjoyable experience, but Ultimate General: Civil War doesn't give its players the tools to do it effectivley.

The ACW is still a very controversial time period in history, and no matter how the subject of slavery is treated in a potential story mode, it's bound to piss some people off. So, it's understandable that Creative Assembly and Sega would shy away from that subject.

Game-Labs, creator of the popular Darthmod mod for Total War hasn't shied away, though. A couple years ago, they released Ultimate General: Gettysburg. UG:G was basically a remake of the classic Sid Meier's Gettysburg game from the '90s, redone in the style of Total War. Just like the classic Sid Meier game, UG:G focused only on the battle of Gettysburg, propeling the player through a series of different scenarios throughout the battle, with the scenarios encountered depending on what the player did in the earlier parts of the battle. It was very well done, and it did allow the player to make custom battles, too. It's just too bad that it didn't have a campaign.

But this new game, Ultimate General: Civil War, has a campaign. I'll be honest and say that's it not the type of campaign that I *really* want. I want something like Total War with an overall strategic campaign map and the possibilites of different troop movements and battles in every game. What UG:CW gives you is a static series of battles that remains the same in every game. The player just has to manage and recruit their troops in between battles. It's not what I want, but it's *much* better than nothing.

Now, the game is in Early Access, so content is still being added. Eventually Game-Labs plans to have every major battle of the war simulated. Considering how well they pulled off UG:G, and also considering how much content they put into UG:CW before putting it in Early Access, I'm willing to have faith in them and believe they'll follow through.

Anyway, with the caveat that this is Early Access, you might as well buy this game. There aren't any other American Civil War RTS games (outside of Total War mods, of course).",1480386368,1480386368,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What a fun game! 

This is the second  game in what is now a series, called Ulitmate General.
The first game dealt  only with Gettysburg, it had a series of battles that got affected  by how you did,  like if the union held on the first day,  the battle would be different  from how  history recorded the second  day  of Gettysburg.  

The game  was fun, nice to look it, and the selling point was the ease  of control and the AI

Now this second game, will let you play the entire civil  war! (when it's done, as it's in early  access, and the game ends after  Antietam)

You start with creating  your general, through a sort of ""light RPG"" character creating screen,  You create a general, You choose  which studies you had at West Point  and so get various  points.


Here we meet the first problem, the nr 1 skill  you  have to put points  in is; Army Organisation. This skill is needed to get; more brigades, bigger brigades,  and more corps. You just have to dump  your skill points as much as possible into it. This kinda defeats the purpose of having a choice in  your character creation. The second skill you need  to dump stuff  into is reconnaissance, so you'll be able  to see at least some info on enemy strength. The other skills seem much less important  and you simply fill up some of them  after getting as high as possible in Army Organisation.


ou then do small battle, where  you have  to  take  a town with  a few thousand men at your disposal. Then hold the town against a counter attack. After this you'll start to build  your army!
After you win the battle  you  get a new skill point(which  goes straight into  army  organization.
And you get; money, manpower, and reputation. Money  is spent on creating  brigades and buying  weapons, manpower is how many recruits  you   have available. And reputation is a sort of political  currency. It  can buy used to ""buy"" more men, weapons or  generals. But it's also your life-line, if you loose to much reputation you will be fired! 

To start your army  you'll have whatever is left after the first battle. You'll need  to add brigades and divisions as soon as possible. It's relatively cheap to make a new brigade, as  long as  you have enough weapons  in your armory.  However adding veteran reinforcements to brigades you  already have is extremely expensive.  When I neared the battle of Antietam, it cost me some 50 000 to  add 500 veteran reinforcements to my best brigades.  Because  you do get best brigades. Not only can you  buy better weapons to them, But they level up, a  Level 3(the max) Brigade is  a monster compared to  a level 0 brigade. If you got a level 3 brigade with 2500 men(the biggest you can  get a brigade) You can count on them standing under extreme pressure. 

But as I said it's extremely expensive to reinforce them(you can reinforce them with rookies, but then the quality  of the brigade goes down)

A step up from the previous title Ultimate General: Gettysburg in many regards. The new addition of the campaign provides an intresting personal narative and allows you to roleplay yourself as a commander in the Union or Confederate Armies. 

The game can be challenging at certain points if you are not prepared for the next battle.  You need to conserve your forces in order to keep your army intact. Playing as the Confederates is in my opinion the way the game is meant to be played as you are faced with much greater odds against you and the resrouce management is a very intresting part of playing as a Confederate commander.

The battle of Antietam, the final battlew in the current alpha,  is a very brtual affair.  You will find yourself horribly out numbered if you play as the Confederates. I had an army of 80,000 men and i had to fight a Union army 120,000 strong.
I managed to win the battle with just 24,000 casualties to the Unions 82,000 i practically destroyed the army of the Potomac at the Sunken Road and Dunkers church.  A great victory but the battle can be extremely tense especially when the union cross the river just to the right of the Sunken Road.

The dev team really outdid themselves with the sequal. To be honest, this game shouldnt even be considered a sequal as it offers so much more content and replayability than gettysburg. The ability to play the game how you want via commanders, equipment, OOB, is just so fun. 

Pros: 
-Vast maps, some of them are really huge so it gives you a giant strategic scope in which to play from.
-The Order of Battle (OOB) system is really refreshing. At the deployment screen you can choose where to deploy units, and once on the battlefield, you can individually place your units within the deployment zone (similar to TW style deployments).
-On some maps, there are 'garrison' type landscape effects that you can use for defensive postures
-Graphics / sound seems about the same as gettysburg, still top notch.
-The game has a slight RPG feel to it as you can build your corps how you want, everything from the cannon to musket/rifle can be selected.

Cons
-AI is slightly finicky right now when there are a LOT of units on the map. At Antietam where theres roughly 140k troops on there, the ai can get confused.
-Some slight unit pathing and positioning bugs. Merely temporary and i imagine will be squashed soon.

The game is a MUST buy as it crests a careful bridge between realism and simulation.

Pros:
-A good and fresh scenario, the American Civil War is not overdone, althought the Game Mechanics could work really well in the Napoleonic Era aswell.
-Solid Sound Design
-Decent Graphic Style
-A really really nice Campaign, you Start with your little Corps with 3-4 Brigades and expend your Army over time, playing Historcial Missions and Random Missions on a little Campaign Map
-The Game Focus on its strength, which are a decent AI and a intereseting Combat System, this Requieres constant Checking of Cover, Ammo and Moral of your Troops.
-additional you just can play Historical Missions, i guess the Campaign the Mainfeature (its really good and addictive)
-If you loose one of your Brigades in a battle and they Surrender, you can try to get them back and free them from the Enemy


Cons:
-While the Graphic Style looks decent, its looks worse then the previous Game
-The AI, sometimes its does great Outflanking manouvers but other times is just Sits there and let your Artillery cuts it to pieces
-Difficulty trough Massive Enemy Numbers, you will find yourself often outnumbered, even if your the Attacking Side, Playing the Southern States this is even worse
-Then again the Sound, Musket sounds are kind of dull and repetetive


Overall a Solid 7/10.
I gues they will flesh out the addictive Campaign Gameplay and improve the Graphics.
Battle Gameplay is really good and just needs some minor tweaks.

This game's major strengths are in its tactical gameplay and its historical authenticity. There is a level of tactical control to the gameplay that few war games are able to reach. It's all about positioning, flanking, and proper use of terrain rather than the size of the forces (although of course size matters).

Regarding its historical authenticity, the game is obviously well researched. The weapons, maps, generals, and units are all authentic. More importantly, the game feels authentic to the period. It's hard to explain, but moving and fighting your armies just feels like you think it should for a war game set during the U.S. Civil War. Playing each battle feels like jumping into a chapter of Shelby Foote's Civil War trilogy. 

My one gripe, you should be able to zoom the camera in further. Ideally you could get right over your soldier's shoulder to judge distance and terrain, but I know the engine doesn't support that. But simply being able to zoom down a couple notches more than you can now would be helpful and create even more immersion. 

Differences between UG: Gettysburg and UG: Civil War

- Hugely expanded scope. UGG was just one battle, UGCW has dozens of different battles, and it wraps them up into a campaign that has light RPG elements and the ability to create and  arm your own units from battle to battle. It feels like you're getting 5-6 times the content as UGG.

- Cover works much better. It's easier to tell when your units are in cover and what the benefits of that are.

- Artillery is improved. Better feedback for the user on what arty is doing.

- Trains!

- Naval units. A welcome addition, as naval warfare was an important and often overlooked aspect of the Civil War.

- Units are destroyed easier. I loved UGG's system of units breaking, then rallying back to the fight, but it seemed like units almost never could be destroyed, just worn down. In UGCV if you really hang a unit out to dry it can get captured or destroyed, which I welcome.

Conclusion: The game is great. If you liked UGG, or you like the USCW era, you must buy this game.",1480083772,1480083772,True,1,0,0.488426119089126587,1,True,False,True

It also gets relatively easier near the end, which is both nice and annoying (because I want to face a challenge)  and often you can end up going for quite a while before restarting because you made an error 2/4 battles ago that just put your troops in an untenable position to win.

It gives the player the best pausable real-time experience of the battles and between battles the player has all the options to form a small, or even a grand army to dominate the battlefield.

It has some ligh rpg elements for the player's general, and every unit is improving according to the events it goes through.

What I miss in greenlight is better handling of supply, a better understanding of the morale of the troops and less units of traitors, which just cannot go along the given plan.
The stupidity sometimes of some generals makes the game historically accurate, but to give the same order five times and see it denied five times for no understandable reason is tiresome.

We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as the ultimate praise for those who gave their time and effort that this game might exist.

It's more than playable and true to UG:G.  If you want a Total War campaign, it isn't there.  But, I personally love the UG approach to tactical command of troups--even over TW.  So, you may want to give it a try--regardless.

Very much UG: Gettysburg, but w/ the markings of a Total War campaign.  It is early access, but the combat and mechanics are very polished.  I can't imagine any UG:G fan not being more than impressed.  I like the way you can script your personal startup characteristics.  It gives a story flavor but tells you the bonuses you'll get depending on choices.  I also appreciate the simplified Easy/Normal/Hard gameplay for the AI--but am unsure if I preferred the old grid.  We'll have to see about that one.

For EA, it's fabulous.  Compared to UG:G, it seems to be the final polished edition w/ new battlefields, the same phased battle mechanic that fades out and back into the next stage, and a running campaign that ties them together, develops your character along the way, and approaches the TW campaign--but, isn't truly there yet.

Now that I'm a bit more into the campaign aspect of it now. I'll summarize it this way. You have choices (go to Bull Run, or follow up on a distress call, and such when choosing the next battle). You also get to buy customizations for your units--upgrade rifles or cannon, hire new officers, recruit units w/ choices related to inf, cav, art. I don't see a research tree yet. But, the way you spend your 'exp pts' from battle to battle allows you to increase your skills that have a direct impact on troop recruiting, recovery, supply during the battle, and the like. Again, it's not TW. But it is an impressive setup. 

I'm looking forward to trying it out over the next week or two. I guess I'd summarize it as something like and XCOM base w/ 2K Basketball 'your life' mode. That's an inadequate comparison, but the best I can come up w/ and not lose time playing. 

Bottom line: If you like UG:G, you'll love this! Just don't expect a full control campaign in the TW style.  Worth the price and investment--even EA!",1479324213,1479969736,True,13,0,0.601476550102233887,3,True,False,True

First of all as always, this review is purely based on my personal opinion so, please don't get triggered

Ultimate General : Civil War, Is the successor of the Ultimate General : Gettysburg, will it live up to its predescessor or will it flop?
I never played Ultimate General : Gettysburg, but i have heard lots of praise for the game, the game is also made from renowned maker of the Darth Mod for Total war series so i'm quite expecting a lot for this game, so lets get into the components shall we...

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
~9/10
The Graphics of the game is not that amazing, but its surely pleasing in the eye, bright colours everywhere and such, and there is no option to set the graphic settings except for your resolution, the minimum spec is quite low as you only need 512 MB of VRam with the minimum graphic card of NVIDIA 8800 and Radeon X1600, which is really nice if you got some low end machine. But the Graphic is not what this game all about

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
~10/10
This is where the game really shine
The AI had done absolutely unimaginable manouver which i had never predicted before, the reaction time of the AI is really Quick, as soon as you move your regiment, the AI will start moving theirs, the AI has been providing a great tons of challange in this game, and if you are not careful, you will suffer a lot of losses, 

The AI is smart, YOU WILL LOSE, Often, especially if you never played this kind of game before, This is surely something i expect from the developer though not to this amount ,  you will feel as if you are fighting a human enemy,

The Game also extremely punishing if you make a wrong move, Rear Flanking would kill hundreds of troops in one volley, which is really devastating, Timing is really important, if you want to move your troops back, you need to time it in between shots and reloading. The AI will also react if you want to flank them by Quickly facing into the direction which negates the flanking bonuses, which is kinda frustrating sometimes

Another great feature of this game is the Army Management, you can start a new campaign and build your general from ground up, this means managing the corps, division and army, the Army Management also lets you equip your soldier with your choice of weapons, featuring realistic historical weapon, you also need to replenish your losses from the battles before. in between battles you also will recieve money and recruits, also experience and reputation which you could lost if you lose a battle,

you could replenish your troops with veterans which means you only lose your army efficiency but if it cost too much, you can use fresh recruits to replenish them, in exchange for the army experience, which means, you will lose your buffs,

This game really makes you care about your army, will you lose the battle for the sake of saving your elites, or you will win by overwhelming your enemies and replenish your troops later, its your decision.
Don't just spam your reputation to spend on things if you don't want to lose the game. if your reputation reach 0 that means that you have lost the game and the game ends there.

You can also pick your faction which is The Union and The Confederate at the start of the game which gives your their perspective of the Civil War.

So Far I'm really enjoying the game, its really fun and challenging.

[h1] Sound [/h1]
~8/10
The Sound is great, the sound of canons and volleys being fired is really nice in the ear but there is this annoying speech when you start the campaign, and i really don't like it, sometimes when you charge your Cavalry into the Fray you will hear the Trumpets Sound which is really satisfying, i wish the developer adds some screams and moaning sounds from the soldier in the field, so far the only thing i heard is RETREAT, RETREAT, RETREAT.

[h1] Final Score [/h1] 
[h1] 9/10 [/h1]

[h1] Finally [/h1]
For a price tag of $29,99 , this game is definitely worth grabbing, this game is easily a $40 title when its finally ready to be released not to mention the amount of new stuff the developer will add on the coming days, I really enjoyed the game so far, and if you like strategy games or the Total War series, this should be on your wishlist or grab it right away and MAKE 1861 - 1865 AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Hopefully, the game will go from strength to strength in the future, and I am confident they can do that. In addition, it's going to be interesting to see what they come up with for their next game!

Ultimate General: Civil War takes that game and expands it with a campaign mode, in which you manage your army as you try to either matain the Union, or win secession from the United States of America. Either side has its flaws and traits, with the Union having more resources, but Confederate soldiers being more determined and hardened fighters. Graphically the game is simple, viewed as if you were observing a map changing in real time. While appearing 2D, the maps actually have a depth to them, in which the units can take advantage of. Hills increase line of sight and firing ranges, forests that obscure vision, valleys, and ravines to traverse through. The sound effects are well done too, as if you were hearing a battle occuring in the distance, musket fire, bayonets and swords clanging, orders and cheers.

If you're a history buff, and are interested in the US Civil War, and a RTS fan, I would highly suggest this game.

I feel like this game is, in my opinion, the spirtual successor to Sid Meier's Gettysburg. It's that good. This is probably going to be deemed the best American Civil War game of all time (up to this point of course). The major battles are really intense in the campaign.

For those new to the game, the Ultimate General series places you in the role of a general on the civil war battlefield. Rather than controlling individual units, you control entire brigades and batteries at once, in much the same way that the commanders of the era did. Battles in these games are slow paced slogs that rely on managing various unit conditions (morale, condition, ammo) while taking maximum advantage of the terrain, with a nearly obsessive historical accuracy. The battles are most similar to those found in a total war game, but far better.

Each day of the battles is now much better connected and the ability to build your army outside of combat is excellent. There's enough little details you can tweak to give it depth, but it never feels overwhelming. The graphics engine has been completely overhauled, switching to 3D. Thankfully, the beautiful art style from the first game is more or less in tact. There's now a much greater diversity of units, with several types of cannon, muskets, rifles and so on to equip brigades with. The combat also feels slightly quicker, with units being able to cover much more ground in a battle than before. Cavalry is also a lot more important and artillery a little less.

I could go on and on about all the little improvements made to the game, like how your screen no longer gets cluttered with red and blue lines when executing a large maneurver, but the bottom line is that if you enjoyed the first game and simply wished there was more of it, your prayers have been answered.

I lost a f*ckton of money. the officer, who was a colonel, and had six battles of experience, was KIA.  Oh and I lost 600 men in the first four minutes of the battle.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkLjiBkuobM

I have decided to update this review to include that I've completed the first 'year' of the war and have alot more to discuss here.

The difficulty settings included in this game seem more or less a risk/reward slider instead of a traditional difficulty setting. The AI seems to more or less react in similiar patterns, meaning if it's hard for you to plot out movements against the standard AI, lowering the difficulty doesn't seem to affect it's patterns. It'll still be 'hard' for you, just you will have smaller armies against you (by around 20% if I remember right).

There is a minor amount of rock paper scissors style combat, as skirmishers can harrass infantry, infantry can mow down calvary if they are ready to fire, cavalry will wreck cannons, and cannons can wreck just about everything.

So lets do the pros/cons:

Pros:

- Customize your army, down to the rifles/cannons each unit uses.
- Decide the make and fielded strength of your army.
- Wins give you career points that allow you to somewhat specialize your playstyle.
- You can deploy troops into 'buildings', such as towns or forts.
- Cover system makes sense, and accounts for different types of cover.
- Has detailed stats, and explains fairly well what these stats do.
- Troops reload and fire efficiently, no more wasted time like in their first game.

Cons:

- Not all battles have been implemented (early access of course)
- Seems like all of the difficulties are the same essentially, just different reward/unit sizes... hopefully that gets fixed.
- Some units seem a bit out of place, such as the first southern battle using ironclads against you... they weren't pressed into service until later in the war. Just saying.
- The reputation system can be quite abusive if you should have a defeat early in the game. Losing the 1st Bull Run dropped the moral of all of my army to 1... out of 100. For the next few battles. Win or lose. With that heavy of a penalty... it made progressing any further ugly as hell.

I love this game as it is... but there are some areas that could use some work. The control scheme is a bit strange at first... watch the video for more discussion on that as well as some visuals of how it works.

The content that I was able to be see seems to lead to another excellent game made by Gamelabs. My only concerns is that sound design for the combat could use cleaning up. Mostly because the low quality fuzzy sounding sound effects combined with the crystal clear sounds kinda ruins the immersion a bit.

In terms of the cover mechanic, I hope the points of interests on the terrian all get a 3d image on the depth mode for the map. Stuff like fence posts, wheat feilds, etc and more will be highlighted than just towns. 

That, and I hope that they'll add the AI personalities again from the Gettysburg game for single battles.   

Apart from that, this EA version of the game feels pretty polished. It appears there's a lot of more tatical elements going on than just dragging units around in key points on a map. Not only does cover reduce damage on units. But, it also effects morale, speed, etc. Also, it feels like winning or losing a battle has consquental weight to it than just deciding what area or battle plans you'll be using on the next stage. 

Update: 11/22/2016

Now that I've gotten some more time with the game. Particularly with the Union Campaign mode on hard. I was able to see a more indepth view of the game's current content. Overall, my stance hasn't changed much. The game still shows a lot potential to be amazing. But, it still needs a lot fine tuning to get there. Gamelabs toning down the enemy numbers a bit has improved the experience drastically. 

I love the idea of building your own army from the ground up and upgrading it with combat experience and equipment. One of the things that makes it interesting is that it appears you need to think carefully on what to spend your resources on. You need to maintain a balence between growing manpower and making sure your units arn't using out of date weaponry.",1479321434,1479816861,True,10,0,0.571150302886962891,0,True,False,True

You can customize the weapons, divisions, leaders, etc.  Every battle is a little bit different PLUS you can replay the battle with a different army mix!  Totally re-playable.  

This is a massive game and you can play it for hours!!  

Loved:
- Risk / Reward for Calvary - Expensive but deadly!  Keep away from infantry brigades or they will melt away
- Spliting Skrimishers from infantry brigades!  Awesome!  More games should allow splitting units up.
- Variety of battles!  Each one different!  Awesome.
- Multiple Battle Objectives! 
- Thank you for no technology tree!!!  God those take up too much time in other games.  
- Buying and equiping your own units!  Awesome.  
- Officer ranks makes a huge difference in the units.  
- Pretty much everything about the units, weapons, leveling up, veterens vs rookies.  Awesome.  


Didn't Like:
- Skrimisher brigades seem to suck.  I would rather have 1000 normal infantry than 500 skrimishers.  (This is for the brigades only.  Deattached skrimishers are awesome)
- Career Path....apart from organization and recon this seems like a waste. 
- Some brigades move on thier own?  This must be a bug but sometimes a key unit just slides out of position for no reason.  I have to keep an eye on the entire battle line to make sure nothing moves.  
- Some advanced weapons have less than 100 units available to buy.  This is not enough to equip a useful brigade.  Seems like a waste.  

Wish List:
- Better history / story / introduction between major battles.  Different if battles won or lost....or a draw?
- Campaign objectives (Like battles) with each battle leading to the objective.  
- More often if you win a major battle it affects your army or the enemies.  Describe to the player the effects.   Gain a unit.  Take away a unit.  Gain supplies.  Lose Supplies. Gain weapons, Lose weapons.  I loved that winning shiloh as CSA I recieved the 3 star Forrest Calvary!

The ability to equip your soldiers, assign officers as well as the SUPER MASSIVE maps has me hooked. I haven't really been able to put this game down for too long. Think Rome Total War series without the massive zoom or the ability to move your army on a map but with bigger maps.

Pros: Intense planning and strategy required, very very playable even though it's a beta, terrain matters and affects movement and firepower,great music, and really well thought out RPG elements. I also liked the mixed terrain of each level which helped keep what almost felt like repitition at bay. Each mission and map requires different strategy and objectives which is really great. Having played the same map on UG:G, this was certianly refreshing. Also tons and tons of content to play right now even though early access.

Cons: Even though they put in a zoom in the patch, I'd still like to get up closer. I do not feel like the artillery does enough damage. There are many different types of artillery and each has it's pros and cons. I do not feel that enough emphasis has been placed on terrain related damage regarding artillery fire.

I love this game.  It reminds me so much of CWG2, if they had taken another step forward and made it real time.  The skirmishers act like sharpshooters, the cav/infantry act the same, but the artillery is a little less powerful, relationally speaking.

There are some things the tutorial doesn't really help show (I didn't even know the Career points existed until after the 3rd or 4th scenario), and the help isn't as filled out as it should be, but this game is ridiculously solid.

I'm having a tonnnnn of fun.  The scenarios are great, hte pause/speed works well, the multiple-stage-objectives are a nice touch.  It's a fantastic Civil War game, and a great tactical management game.  The individual unit/general customization isn't overly complicated.  One thing I *hate* with some games is you can get 'too' specific and you wind up spending 20 minutes to set up 1 of 30 unique units.  This has enough customization without over doing it.

I have veteran infantry units with solid gear, specifically trait'd for speed in movement, and several rookie infantry units with basic high-melee guns.  They're my front line pickets, with my veteran units moving swiftly to fill gaps.

I can set up my artillery to be long-range harassers, or short/mid range powerhouses.  I can use my cav as mobile infantry with moderate ranged power, or as charge-melee-masters, outflanking the enemy, and cutting the command units/supply trucks/artillery batteries to pieces!

When it works well, it's a blast, but the game is inscrutable, gives you practically no information, and seems to defy logic at times.
For example, I was once on a ridge, with 1200 veterans shooting down at an enemy group of 600 men, in a river, when they charged me.
One would think my side had the clear advantage; we outnumbered them, and we had the high ground. What happened instead was we lost 250 men and retreated. Why, you ask? Excellent question, but the game never tells you. This happens a lot in the game, especially with charges. An enemy charge will destroy my line, while my charges do nothing to the enemy - again, no explanation given. 
The objectives are similarly obscure; if I take two of 3 positions, and I'm contesting the third when the day ends, that's a loss. That is to say, the enemy has been pushed off 2/3 of the map, and is being pushed off the remaining third, but you still lost.
Now, if there were a binary win/lose system, that might make sense - you haven't clearly, objectively won. But the game also has a draw - or at least, it claims to, but apparently being 99% of the way to victory is still a loss, so I'm left to wonder what it takes to end the day in a draw.

Then, a substantial amount of the time, my own units refuse to listen to me. I tell them to position themselves across the river from an opponent, they choose to wade across it and get massacred. I tell them to shoot an enemy, they walk until they're 20 feet away and just sit there. I tell them to reposition, they continue firing at the same enemy until judgement day. 
It's very possible these are all bugs, but I can't be sure. It's also possible that it's just a result of a dumb AI, but I can't be sure of that, either. It's even possible there are mechanics that are at play I nothing about, but I can't be sure because the game refuses to tell me about them. As a result, I will be attacking in cover, from the high ground, surrounding an enemy with fewer troops than I have, and still lose. Any attempts I've made to understand why that is are met with dysmal failure because the game refuses to tell you what's happening or why. All you can do is watch your troop counters tick down constantly, even when you're not being shot at or in melee combat, and wonder why outnumbering the enemy three to one isn't enough to even push them back an inch.",1479676355,1479676355,False,46,2,0.654638290405273438,8,True,False,True

The first of this game was getteysbug was just great I have some115 hours on that one. I love that you can just jump into a battle play it for hour or so . was easy to lear as well  Grphics were okay . for the 10 bucks 5.00 on sale was woth it . 
I seen this said ouch 30 bucks  but seen all the battles and the ones yet to come , so it came out to  about a buck a battle if you switch sides 50 cents so great by again . I am into 25 hours of the game just learning and having a blast  . Building a armry  really you do a corps  division and so on . It is a little confusing bad . 
The graphics have improved over the first game as well .   I live in texas and do wood working so this being the winter months is when I work more in shop when it is not so hot out . It is a shame since I been wanting come in and play this game so much more . 
I think I got a bug  normally a game does not get under my skin this one has , simply because it is easy to grasp , but hard to master , Make sure your saving your games as well  so if you lose you can try a diferent stratergy . 
Normally I do not pay mor then 10 bucks for my games and have to be on sale , this is the second time I have bought a game that was NOT on sale and PRE release  for 30.00  both were worth every penny . 
Buy this game if there is one game you going buy this Holiday season make it this one  10/10 
and when the rest of the battles come out wow going sleep with this game on my brain

The price seemed a little high for a still-in-progress game, but viewing the youtube videos only reinforced my desire to purchase the game. Having now played for a few hours, my interest has certainly been rewarded by what is a fine game already. 

In my first battle I somehow managed to capture an enemy unit (unknown in any game I have previously played ever!) I won two short introductory battles and then faced the Bull Run (or was that Shiloh?) battle, where playing as the Confederacy I had to defend, but later counterattack. I won again, but only after facing severe tests of my ""tactical awareness and willpower"". Forgive my confusion over the battle name, as I'm still recovering from the intensity of it all.

A fine game. One guy in a metacritic review slated the use of sprites in a 2016 game, he wanted models? Well it does not bother me if the graphics are a bit dated (sprites) but it is the GAMEPLAY which is most important. Does the game AI give me a good challenge, maybe do surprising things so I have to respond, do hours pass by in enjoyable and rewarding activity.... all are answered .... YES!

Cons: I'm still a bit confused over the buying of armaments after the major battle, did my buying of Springfield rifles really make a difference? I don't know yet, but I expect this part of the game will become clearer the more I play it.

Overall, I'm very happy with UG Civil War, 8.5 out of 10.

Pros
-Battle length feels just right, long enough to have to deal with ammunition problems, morale, fatigue, to manuevre, but short enough it doesn't drag on.
-Keeping some of your units with you feels good, i recently outfitted my favourite unit with Missipi rifles rather than their standard springfields and i reaped a massive reward in the next battle
-Nice mechanic updates over the original ultimate general
-Terrain is important. Assaulting a fort / big hill is BRUTAL
-Sound design is very nice, hearing the crack of the rifles is great

Cons
-AI usually comes with ridiculous numbers of troops compared to yours in the campaign.
-Sometimes clicking on some things can be a little bit fiddly, same with troop positioning. i've had my units have a brainfart and take flank fire because they wheeled around in an odd way
-Early access, so its not fully complete yet
-no more topographic view. that was a huge help in the original for positioning my artillery

Big thumbs up from me for the price. I don't have a good judgement on how smart the AI is just yet, but overall it doesn't feel too dumb. i really liked the ai in the original ultimate general so hopefully this measures up especially with multiple updates.",1479649640,1479649640,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There is very little tedious 'record keeping', however, that can be a negative in some ways. For example, in Total War: Empire, a player may take different formations with different effects -- an infantry unit can form a square formation that obliterates cavalry, for example. Not so here. The units recover from routs or being chased off on their own (although, as usual, a general nearby helps quicken the recovery.)

On the other hand, it's kind of nice to be freed from all those decisions. The units have enough intelligence to do what they need to do and all you do is direct them on a broad basis. ""Go here."" ""Attack them""....and so on. It also might have been nice to have a little more in terms of economy -- I have so many towns, each produces this and that, and etcetera.

But that's all the record keeping that can be tedious. I suppose if they had included that, and allowed you to skip over it if you wished, that would have made it the ideal game. 

But the lack of record keeping is refreshing, on some levels, too. It's nice to have a game that doesn't become 'work' to play. When I want a bit more mindless of a game, this one is it. Don't get me wrong, it's still very challenging -- just, less work.

For anyone who enjoys this type of historical RTS I would say this is a must buy.
There are many huge single battles to be played as well as a wonderful campaign which has you embark on your civil war career for either side. This is not just a gimmic as it provides added depth, tactics and stratergy - from how to build and outfit your armies to what course your career takes as the war rages on.

The only downside is that at time of writing there is no multiplayer but the AI is far superior to most games of this type and will react realistically and skillfully with no hidden cheaty algorithms to disguise weak coding like some games (cough)

On top of all this there is a custom game mode which wasn't fully fleshed out at time of writing and still to come campaigns that cover the entire civil war.
If you are unsure if  you will like it try the previous game from this developer, Ultimate General Gettysberg, which is quite cheap but  much more limited in scope (sill provides many hours of gameplay though) - if you like that you will go crazy for this!

Sid Meir, Elder Scrolls, Freelance are just a few of the games and publishers that have left a lasting impact.  After several days in this game and having previously played UG Gettysburg, Games Labs stands on the edge of lasting impact or lasting shame(LGN still remains king of Gaming Shame).

At a glance anyone who has studied the Civil War can see that this Publisher has done his home work.  Weapons are accurate to the period, Generals are well researched and though its still rough their AI acts in accordance with the historical records of the officers.

AI is a beautiful challenge throughout what I have played so far.  I have been outflanked, outmanuvered, and overwhelmed at times.  This game will force you to think and use the tools at your disposal.  Micromanaging is very easy but when you have 4 full divisions on the battlefield it can be confusing.

As it stands I would recommend this game, it is beautifully done, provides great challenge, and replayability.  I can only hope that it gets better as they work on it.  There are a few things though I see from the get go that perhaps will change in the release version.

I will eagerly watch this game and its development as I play it again and again.

Based on the great support the developer gave that game during its Early Access and well after its release I had no hesitation in buying Ultimate General Civil War in Early Access.

I have not been disappointed. The addition of the campaign greatly extends the previous game and the battles have also been tweaked with the adddition of fortified positions and the ability to capture troops. I may be just imagining it but troop positioning seems even more important with flanking and rear attacks being very effective. The game highlights if your men are being flanked which is great and definately adds to the tension in the battles.

I have not encountered any bugs and the only issue I really have is the lack of information about the campaign mode which I understand will be fixed very soon.

This is the best wargame I have found that strikes the balance between playability and the need for meaningful strategy and tactics.

My core Corps from the North while 1 Divison from the AoNV (essenial non-core troops) tried to take the Stone Bridge. The Battle went bad for me initially, taking quite a few losses at the Stone Bridge. However, the enemy became to overzalous and forgot to protect his left flank, which I rolled up with my core Corps and a 2nd Division from the AoNV. The battle for Henry Hill went for quite a while. Jackson actually did his ""Stonewall"" thing, and later a bayonet charge. But it failed to repel all of my regiments. I then slowly enveloped the Hill, squezing their units out of it. The counterattack by the enemy was a failure.

I played Game-Labs’ first game, Ultimate Battle: Gettysburg and enjoyed it thoroughly. This Release puts a great new spin on their initial concept with several new and interesting features. The game has far more to offer than Ultimate Battle: Gettysburg with an entirely new campaign system. The interface, controls, and graphics have all been improved. New features like weapon types, perks, commander death, and capture are all awesome and make the game more challenging and entertaining.  If you want to be challenged, engrossed, and thoroughly enjoy your time spent, think about picking up this game and support the devs to add new features and continue to improve this fantastic title.

And that doesn't even touch on the army building, which allows you to create and control brigades and divisons where you choose thier makeup and armament. Though it's kind of weird you have to buy your weapons, I mean you're in the army, maybe they're trying to simulate limited supply?

Still some weirdness to work out, notably it's not clear why certain units choose to move automatically. It's minor, not like, they randomly walk off the fieild or anything, but I'd like an indication as to why, like a little ""Repositioning Sir!"" or ""The Men Need to Pull Back Sir!"" pop up above the unit or something like that.

You can now send out skirmishers from your Infantry divisions and Dismount your Cavalry divisions. The maps look beautiful and the attention to historical detail is astounding.

The biggest Con I have right now is that you can't save while you're on the map. At all. There are other drawbacks, as Game-Labs has removed the terrain elevation lines from UGG in favor of switching between overhead and isometric views of the battlefield to gauge elevation. However, these views do not offer the best view to determine subtle changes in elevation which contribute to LOS and the effectiveness of artillery.

So, you can start as an officer, of any rank.  The part that makes it great is that you can upgrade your own forces.  You start with a certain amount of men and money and as you win battles you get more, and you get promoted, and get able to control more men.

So, with that, you can also upgrade your individual units.  The unit is brigade.  Each brigade has a commander and you get to see him improve as battles happen.  You get to also promote him yourself, or, if he gets killed, you can get a new commander from the military academy.

You can upgrade the brigades via men and weapons.  The men come in two forms, rookies and veterans. Veterans cost more money to recruit, though.  Also, you have dozens of different indivual weapons.  M1842 muskets, M1842 rifled muskets, shotguns, horse pistols, revolvers and carbines for cavalry, M1855 and 1861 springfields, 1853 Enfields, Whitworths, and even Henry rifles.  not to mention all the types of artillery.  Again, each weapon costs a certain amount to buy, and you must have enough in your armory/shop to outfit an entire brigade to purchase (example- if you have 1500 men and 1200 springfields then you can't buy them until you get 300 more springfields).  Furthermore, each weapon has its own characteristics when it comes to reload speed, range, and melee fighting capacity.    And there is ammunition supply per brigade as well, so you have to make sure the wagons are close by 

So, that leads into the fighting.  FIghting is much better now. Terrain and weapon ability means everything.  In Gettysburg, it was 'deadly accurate union infantry' vs 'hard charging confederate infantry.'  and charging was a death sentence and artillery sucked.  Here, it's much more nuanced. Fighting is more '1300 man  veteran confederate infantry with enfields vs 1600 man union infantry behind a wall with single shot .69 muskets' In that scenario the confederates would win more often than not, just like in real life, where experience can trump small numbers.  Artillery switches ammunition automatically; when infantry charge and artillery fire, you can automatically see the ripples on the ground simualting canister shot.  There are also cavalry that can charge into broken units.  There are bullet wagons, also.  Don't forget to reload your ammunition wagon before every campaign or the rwagons  will run out of ammunition.  Purchasing ammunition also costs money, so make sure that wagon is full to the brim before you buy those 1500 enfields you want so badly.

So, I know this is the early release, but hot goddamn this is great.  If this is early release I can't wait for regular release.  Worth every bit of 30 dollars",1479488660,1479488660,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I loved the original Ultimate General: Gettysburg, and even though a lot of new innovations are added to this title, and even though I'd still recommend this game they're still a lot of issues that I feel people should be aware of before spending 30 dollars.

Cons: 
Officers and Regiments- anyone who played the first Ultimate General knows one of the most immersive aspects of the game was how every brigade was manned by their historical officer and they're was a drawn portrait of them next to their name. Even the most famous generals like William Sherman don't have a portrait next to their name, and the vast majority of Brigades rehash the same names leading to fighting General Bee's brigade in every battle of the war. Hopefully by full release the developers study their history and make it a bit more immersive.
Map topography- Another great feature from UGG was the ability to read the topography of the map via contour lines, yet they removed this from UGC making it far more difficult to position your troops/cannons. 
Audio- It's still good, but it definitely needs improvements. Minor fix, but once you notice it you can't forget it. 
Troop movement- I really dislike the way the soldiers move in this installment. In UGG it wasn't perfect but now it feels like the brigades aren't following my mouse cursor when I move them. This is doubly true when I'm moving troops over bridges, it's really difficult to move them over bridges for some reason.

That was pretty critical, but this game is still great, a few minor improvements and it'll be the best civil war era game, maybe even the best ""line infantry"" game of all time.

I recently bought Empire:TW JUST to install the ACW mod to get my fix, but to be honest it wasn't cutting it.  Within 5 minutes of first seeing this game on the Steam store and checking it out, I bought it. 

tl;dr version is this | THIS. GAME. RULES. There are LOTS of customizable options from your General down to the compositions of your armies that you then get to take into an awesomely entertaining RTS battle on huge maps. You really do get to shape the battles the way you would have fought them. I would definitely say that this game is worth $30. You will absolutely see where your money went once you start playing the game, and I'm blown away this is early release. Feels like a complete game already. 

Not TL;DR | Whether you are into the civil war or not, this game is incredibly enjoyable. And this is way more than an RTS. It's got tons of customization for your Army. You create the army that you play these battles with. You choose how many cannons are in your cannon brigades, you choose which weapon the 1000 man infrantry force will bring in, or if your skirmishers are crackshot snipers or have cheap guns and are just a meaty speedbump to slow down that enemy infantry advance.  Your general has different skills that affect the flow of the battle, you create his divisions and choose who leads each and every one. There are so many good things that make this game so fun that there would never be the same playthrough twice, never the same experience.

The maps are huge, your units constantly arriving and needing directed into the heat of the battle. It's large scale and blows me away. I cannot understate just how FUN this game is. Watching the infantry division you created, lead by the leader you chose for it charging into battle, blasting huge clouds of gunsmoke at the enemy, watching that enemy unit melt away and flee is incredibly satisfying.

Being able to name my own custom regiments, decide on whether they get replenished with grizzled veterans (which costs me more money but results in overall better performance) or green recruits is awesome, you can even pick from a large variety of weapons for them to use with different strengths and weaknesses. For example one Regiment has been armed with rifles making them excellent for long range supporting fire with a fast reload rate, whilst its sister regiment has been armed with heavy muskets devastating at close range before closing in for the charge.

If you enjoyed ""Ultimate General: Gettysburg"", I definitely recommend this. I've only played a couple of battles so far (Philippi and Gaines Mill), but I am greatly enjoying it. Admittedly, it's been a while since I last played ""Gettysburg"", but combat appears to be improved (artillery actually does noticeable damage, you now have to resupply troops with ammo, charging doesn't automatically cause your troops to rout, etc.). The campaign also looks like it will add some depth to the game (allowing you to upgrade and reinforce your forces after each engagement as you fight through the war), so I am excited to explore that more. 

As it is now, this is a fun game for Civil War nerds like me. I guess my only concern at this point is that I don't see many of the other major late-war battles (i.e. Wilderness, Spotsylvania CH, Cedar Creek, etc.) on the list of future additions to the game, but that has no real bearing on my opinion of the game as it is now. At any rate, I will update my review later as I continue to play with it.

UPDATE: 
Ater investing another 10ish hours since my initial review, I have a few more observations. I've only encountered a few minor bugs, which I have faith will be fixed upon release or soon after. Battles are still fun. I enjoy the ""Historical Battles"" most, as these are closest to what actually happened (although I wish the Dunker Church at Antietam actually looked like the real thing). 

The campaign on the other hand is definitely in need of some work. I have started three different campaigns (Brig. Gen. difficulty). I lost the first two and I'm actually stuck on the third. The biggest issue with the campaign at this point is that as the game progresses, your army needs to grow in size. I have the unfortunate tendency to lose almost as many troops in battle as I gain afterwards. So, when I can fight battles I am almost always outnumbered (even when I play as the Union). In my current campaign, I cannot progress because I need two corps in order to fight Gaines Mill, but I cannot create a second corps. I think this could be fixed fairly easily if we could simply get more rewards for winning minor battles or even getting draws (receiving rewards for losses seems silly).

That said, I look forward to seeing what will be improved upon/expanded as the game is fully released.",1479315700,1479410522,True,79,3,0.84059751033782959,7,True,False,True

You can choose how large your divisions are, how well equiped, what type of divison, who commands them, what they are called, if they will replenish with veterans or rookies, etc. Really makes your army one of a kind. I also suspect that there will be high replayablity since there's so many ways to play and there's both a full union and confederate campaign. It explains very little about the game but you catch on very quickly. Definetly needs some work until it's a finished product, but it's far, far more finished than most early access games.

I already have Ultimate General: Gettysburg and I really enjoy that game even though it has a few flaws.

 I noticed with this new game the game developer pretty much iimproved everything except for two things which I think are needed to make the game even better.  First is the zoom feature.  They have a zoom feature already but when you zoom in on the maps everything is still way too small to look at in detail.  They need to fix the zoom feature so you can zoom in even closer to look at your units.  Second is they need to have a rotation button so you cam rotate around the maps.  Everything is seen from one angle on each map and I want to be able to look at battles on the maps from different angles.

 I know the game is in early access so I hope the game developer listen to gamers who play these kind of game alot.  Fix these two items and you will have a great game to play.
