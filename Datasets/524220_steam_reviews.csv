Unfortunately, it endlessly dragged on, and this game missed a lot of what makes other RPGs good.

A lot of things in the game are ass (not the good kind üçë)

No autosaves. This is UX hell. While yes there are many save points around you and you can usually save from the pause menu when close to one of them, this is just asking for problems. I didn‚Äôt lose anything fortunately, but many people online have, especially if they stumble upon the many troll endings for this game.
Combat is simply not good. It feels unclear and imprecise. Part of this I think has to do with the abundance of vfx that are always present while you‚Äôre fighting making for reduced visibility. All your attacks don't feel varied or interesting enough so it begins to feel like a grind very quickly.
Story: Pretty well written I‚Äôd say, it maintains interest, it‚Äôs just pacing which is off. The 2nd playthrough is BS. You finish the entire game then have to replay the entire thing as 9S with minimal differences honestly. That‚Äôs such a troll move. Just make a shorter and better story instead. Playthroughs 3-4 were good though.
9S‚Äôs minigames kinda suck. I speak from a mouse / keyboard perspective too, so this will also tie in to how I‚Äôve heard that the controls lean more for controller gameplay with minimal effort put in towards a keyboard / mouse adaptation. In these minigames there almost feels like there‚Äôs this phantom stick drift for mouse or something where the direction of the ship keeps changing, it‚Äôs weird, I don‚Äôt really know how to describe it. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Soundtrack is pretty bad. Very few tracks are nice while the rest sound generic. All the music being in made up languages is also a poor design decision as it just sounds like gibberish and doesn‚Äôt resemble any modern languages really.
Character writing is also pretty bad. And when I say bad, I don‚Äôt mean regular bad, I mean Star Wars sequel trilogy level of bad. The interactions between A2 and her pod made me want to kill myself they were so cringe. Characters also have zero personality whatsoever. They are robots and act like robots all the way through and have no development (with the exception of 9S a bit). 2B may have a nice booty, but if she has zero personality whatsoever, that doesn‚Äôt make her waifu material. Come on people.

NieR Automata has some nice things though, no game is ever 100% bad:
Beautiful environment art all throughout. With the exception of the factory seeming a bit bland as well as occasional graphical glitches, NieR Automata has immersive environments that are satisfying to explore.
This game actually has good quest design. Part of this is helped by the fact that NieR Automata has nice map design as well. Environments are not overly big that even running through them instead of using fast travel feels fine.

NieR Automata reminded me a lot of Scarlet Nexus, both games have some unfortunate flaws, and while NA had better story writing and quests than SN, the bad outweighed the good, and I‚Äôd highly recommend you play SN if this game left you unsatisfied.

Pros: Super fun action, cool character designs, likeable and fun characters, multiple layers to the story.

Cons: English voice acting is rough in some places, specifically for Adam and Eve.

Fantastic game that missed the GOTY mark for me due to several poor design choices that severely hampered the overall experience.

Scrolling down the review page for this game, I could find almost no reviewer - even among the ones that did not recommend it - that had actual problems with the game itself. Most of the cons listed had entirely to do with PC port performance issues, of which I had none. Like most others, I enjoyed this game, but you are likely well aware of all the reasons you should buy it. Fair enough, because I like it too, but a couple of gameplay choices prevented me from loving and wanting to replay it.

You see that gif of 2B elegantly evading an attack and then mounting a stylish counter attack on the store page for this game? When I first saw that, I was stunned because it was one of the smoothest animations I had ever seen. Fortunately, NieR blesses you with this caliber of gorgeous animation throughout the game. Combat in NieR not only looks beautiful, however; it's impressively fluid and dynamic: 
[*]You can wield 2 of the four weapon types simultaneously 
[*]When playing, you choose one weapon type for light attack and one for heavy. [*]Each weapon functions differently depending on which attack type it's assigned to (meaning there are a significant amount of combinations possible).
[*]You can swap between two sets of weapons with a single button press.[/list] 
All of this comes together to create a flashy, highly customizable combat system that makes you look forward to every engagement.

Unfortunately, everything I just said is really only true for about half of the game. Once you get a third of the way through the entire game, in one of the most confusing design choices ever made, the game forces you to play as a weaker character that throws away what made NieR's original combat fun. 9S only has one button for attacking and can only wield one weapon at a time instead of cycling between four weapons like was previously possible. He has a minuscule movelist as a result of this, so you have little choice other than to spam one attack chain over and over again when playing him. His attacks are also much slower and the few moves he does have don't flow nearly as well as those of the other playable characters. 

I am utterly baffled that the developers thought that reworking the combat system to be far worse and then forcing you to play as a character with this inferior system for half the game was a good idea. 2A is fun to play because she plays like 2B with some additional flavor. That's what 9S should have been. 

While 9S' combat abilities are substantially worse, there is something he's capable of that 2B is not: hacking. Regrettably, this in no way makes up for his weaknesses from a gameplay perspective; quite the contrary. Hacking is an extremely boring minigame, its appearance should have been sparse, but it thoroughly suffocates gameplay during the second and third campaign. Eventually, it gets to the point where you're having to hack over and over again in rapid succession near the end of the game. You also have the option to voluntarily use it against opponents in combat, during which it is wildly overpowered since there is little stopping you from spamming it against bosses. The only reason I refrained from doing this was because of how dull hacking is.

Finally, I find it rather irritating that there is no real New Game+ mode in a game with such a heavy focus on combat and upgrades. For those that know how the story is structured, I don't mean the 2nd and 3rd playthrough, of course. I'm talking about when you beat the *entire* game and want to start from the very beginning with all your weapons and upgrades. This is, sadly, not quite possible. Instead, the developers added an option to let you replay any part of the game, but neglected to include any form of enemy level scaling, which removes the point of doing so. If you were to go back to the beginning of the game after beating it, you would oneshot everything and combat would be 0 fun. 

None of these issues are enough to prevent Nier from being worth your money though. While the gameplay is exceptional in many ways (when you're not forced to play a weaker character), the story really was the best thing about NieR:Automata. At its climax, it is a love-letter to philosophy with plenty of emotional and memorable moments. Although I didn't always enjoy playing it, I'm glad I pushed through the moments where I didn't to see this game through to the end.",1500015491,1708535216,True,3,0,0.539923965930938721,0,True,False,False

Its a masterpiece.

Went into the rabbit hole of yoko's continued work on nier automata in other media forms, and destroyed my mental health all over again. 10/10.

After completing all NieR Automata endings i can confirm that this game is an absolute masterpiece and definitely the best game i've ever played in my life.

Endings D & E are really insightful especially if you're someone like me who struggles with clinical depression and feeling unworthy, made me cry a lot and realize a lot of things about myself that i used to not take for granted. And what not, realize that your existence in this world, even if it doesn't matter right now, someday somehow it will.

The philosophies of Nietzsche, Kant, Camus, Pascal and Kierkegaard are very present in this game, and even tho they are opposing philosophical currents, the narrative treats them in a way that no other medium ever did. If i have to describe this game in other ways, i would say it's a love letter to existentialism and all of it's currents.

This game changed my life and the way i think about myself for the better, and if you do try it, i hope it does the same to you too.",1707756933,1708270251,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is truly a work of art on a Michelangelo level, and if you have the money laying around you MUST buy this game and experience it for yourself. 

The character development is some of the best, the 3 main characters are all developed some perfectly and all have very large roles, which is great so no one character has a large role but then the other main character is almost a side character, only one other game that I can think of has done this similarly which is Detroit:Become Human, but even then I don't think it was on the same level of this masterpiece of a game. The characters also have an intriguing relationship, and works perfectly in the end to create a great ending that will leave any player confused, sad, and happy all at the same time.

Now for a short(er) part of the review, The Music, all that I really need to say is that it's perfect and makes the game just the right amount of dramatic to make any scene hit harder than a freight train. The music makes absolutely any scene perfect, it makes even the Minecraft soundtrack scared. Not to mention the fact that most of the songs are in the NieR language, which is insane on its own how the creators put that much effort into the MUSIC. Also wanted to mention that there is a song that literally is in 3 languages in the soundtrack (English, Japanese, and the NieR language).

My only pet peeve with the game is in very little spots the graphics look bad, but that doesn't subtract from the beautiful story, and entertaining combat. Overall the game is 1000% worth buying, the game is just perfect and even when you finish the game you'll want to both play through it again but realize how long it took and how you wont be able to experience the story for the first time ever again. And sorry for the long review even though I know someone has a whole 20 paragraph paper in here.

I'll start by saying that while I personally didn't find the story to be quite as profound as it seems some people have, this is still a game I very much enjoyed and would still recommend.

First, the feel of the gameplay. I quite enjoyed the combat, an action combat system that I feel is more skill oriented than many other action RPGs. You could play this game without even being hit if you wanted, if your evasion skills are good enough. Combos such as light attacks into heavy attacks and just swinging weapons around generally feels good. I also love the speed of running when traversing the world, makes it feel like you can get through even the big open areas fairly quickly.

Second, the soundtrack. The soundtrack is amazing, perfectly matches the ambiance of each area and/or situation and many soundtracks seem to be dynamic and change their sound depending on where you are or what you're doing. It also makes it hit that much harder when some locations change along with game progress.

And lastly... The story is still great. Though I wouldn't quite hold it at 'masterpiece' level. It is certainly unique in the way it is structured and it is an interesting story. I particularly enjoyed A2's bit of a character arc. The story has weaknesses though, the main one of which I feel is that it is a little short. Don't get me wrong; I'm not against a shorter RPG! I get tired of playing 80+ hour long ones. But for this game, which I cleared the main story for in about 28 hours + some side quests, I feel that there just wasn't enough time spent with the characters to properly develop them or be properly emotionally invested in them, both with the main cast and a few side characters. If the game were just a bit longer, maybe I could have gotten a little more invested in these characters. Again, the story is still good! Just not perfect.

Overall, I do recommend this game. In my opinion, it's merits go beyond it's story, it's honestly just a fun game to play, and having a good story just makes it that much more worth playing, even if it's not quite life changing.

Edit: Just thought I'd add one thing I really liked about the presentation of the story in parts. A lot of dialogue (especially new mission dialogue, etc) is done vocally whilst still in control of your character. That's a great thing in my opinion! I hate when a game has excessive cutscenes that take away control of the character too often for minor dialogue (like Xenoblade Chronicles 3... and a lot of other jRPGs). Nier Automata strikes a really good balance with this, cutscenes all feel important, add to the experience and are not excessive. This was something I really appreciated about the game!",1703418245,1707823183,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h3]‚úø CONS[/h3]
- IT'S NOT ENOUGH. I NEED MORE!!

[h3]‚úø RATING: 10/5[/h3]
// [b]I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS[/b]! i CANNOT stress it enough how i love this game. it's a masterpiece! hands down a mind blowing game! i never knew that i can love each and everyone of the characters even if they're the enemies. a lot of times, i questioned myself as a player because of the things i needed to do in the game. it's not because the game mechanic is bad; it's because of the psychological aspect that made me think i shouldn't be doing it. that's not even the best part. just when i thought i had finished the game, it throws me into a new run showing a new point of view and a new story! more depressing and heart-tugging content? YES PLEASE! it made me go in a wild roller coaster ride.

the combat is also fun! it's very smooth and it doesn't feel repetitive even though the world is action-packed and basically chaotic. it feels so satisfying when you perfectly evade enemy attacks and counter them. there are several different weapons you can choose from that show different animation combos so you can definitely mix and match as per your preference. i must say that i wasn't a fan of the hacking mechanic at first but it grew on me after several hours of game play. it's very easy though.

now, the music? it is amazing. it is soulful. it matches the theme so well! it's the kind of music that builds your emotions up and delivers all the feels where it needs to be. it's perfect! i definitely think that it contributed a lot to make this game a masterpiece that it already is!

i would also like to say thank you to the random strangers [spoiler]who sacrificed something important in order for me to push through. you have successfully made me tear up. your sacrifices were not in vain[/spoiler]. we made it!

The combat is fun and satisfying, and there's depth to it. And the gameplay often switches to entirely different genres, keeping it fresh and engaging and you on your heels as you Armored Core and twin-stick shoot your way through enemies, both in the open world and digital spaces. 

The music score is easily one of the best I've heard in all my life, so much so that I listen to them quite often. The lyrics make no sense, but carry more emotion than most other video game music scores.

The graphics is okay. It is on the higher end but nothing amazing, as is typical of JRPGs - you just learn to live with it, and at some point you just forget it's a problem at all. 

The story is unexpected, (unexpectedly good, heh heh) but very well written. The characters are well designed, memorable and impactful. They make clever use of 4th wall breaking to enhance the immersion, and it's quite good. Though in the end you are left with more questions than answers, you feel a sense of satisfaction that your actions made an impact in the game's world - I shall say no further or I'll risk spoiling it. 

Yes, there are bugs. And unfortunately the developer could not be arsed to fix them - but don't let that prevent you from experiencing this game. Fortunately Kaldaien's Special-K mod does the trick for most people.

Highly recommended. This goes into my ""games worth playing atleast once in life"" list. Made me buy the game üëÄüëÄüëÄ",1707686118,1707686759,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game will definitely emotionally damage you but it will be worth it.",1707543013,1707572609,True,2,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

I would encourage other players to buy this as even after almost a decade this game still outshines other AAA titles after it was released. If you can, please buy this game at full cost. The developer definitely deserves the support and I hope they release more games like this in the future.

NOTE: It works well on the Steam Deck.

Themes such as identity, soul, memories, honor, duty, accompany the player throughout the game. At the base there is always a state of melancholy, of survivors in an almost deserted world populated by machines and androids.
The game combines different gameplay styles in an elegant and sometimes, especially towards the end, furious but successful way.
The only note I can make is that if you are a persevering player who loves looking for objects, towards the middle of the game in Normal mode you will be too powerful and will no longer have any difficulty completing it. Perhaps some side quests are superfluous, and the quantity of objects, weapons, materials is really excessive and you will find yourself completing the game with a huge unused baggage, unless you want to persevere once the game is finished. The idea of the division into chapters is interesting, but perhaps breaks the general atmosphere, especially the first few times. But I understand that it is useful as a function of the story.

I just got done with the final ""true"" ending and I've never been so speechless after playing a game, that ending might be one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in all of gaming.

This game has an incredible story with lots of different endings as well as fun side-quests, which keep you entertained for the longest time. The characters too and the way they progress through the story as well makes you feel connected with them, like you are with them personally together on their journeys. And even though the PC's controls are slightly out of wack compared to the console controls, everything still pretty much feels the same, and you can still get the same amount of fun playing on PC. This game overall is one of my all time favorite games TILL THIS DAY.

I am not really into RPG/JRPG's or have ever played a Platinum title.  After seeing this game praised for the last 6 (+) years, brought up time and time again, even in our current hell-scape of ""live service/ever-evolving titles, watching creators like SkillUps review praise the combat; I finally gave in.  A couple years ago I tried it on GamePass but didn't have or make the time to put into its opening sequences (still had my preconceived feelings adding to it) and before I knew it; it was gone from ""G.P."".  I kept seeing post or cosplay's centered around 2B, the game, or its underlining story pop up on post or my timeline; don't get me started on the soundtrack when it is brought up about your current favorite games OST.  Finally I pulled the trigger and purchased it, hoping that I would spend the $1-60min value Spool (from Funhause) taught me all those years ago would pan out and DAMN did it ever!

Until Destiny I never really understood the concept of ""end game"" or appreciate the value of good side content or story-line quests (that 2nd part not so much from D1/D2 more along the line of S.O.t.T.R. or God Of War).  This game takes that mindset to a whole-nother level.  Not only was I hooked in my feelings after finishing 2B's story, I was excited to see 9S's side of the story unfold from his perspective and what was really going on behind the scenes at the ""bunker"".  What's this, there is a whole 3rd side plot with a fleshed out story from a character that we only met briefly, and heard minor back story plots of through the previous two play-through's?  I would be lying if I said I didn't shed a tear or two after both of the final story endings.  

I beg, anyone that has the slightest bit of interest in this game to give it a try.  While I can't guarantee you will enjoy it as much as I (or others) have, within the first 90 minuets you will know if this is your kind of game.  Multiple game genre's crammed into that opening sequence(s), all which expand on (heavy) through each story-line.  Don't let the JRPG tags fool you, this game is so damn deep, the build (chip) ability, the story, hell the amount of content this game offers is still worth the full asking price as if it was released yesterday.  If nothing else, add it to your ""wish list"" and wait for it to go on sale; you wont be disappointed.

Hope this will give someone the nudge they need to take that first step and give this game a try.  If it has, please let me know what you think after finishing the first play-through or you have gotten far enough along to give it an honest ""review"".  Again, I am just a 40 something guy that enjoys a good game; especially one that can make me think about it when I am living my day to day responsibilities.

Their depth, development, and relatability elevated the overall gaming experience to new heights. The narrative itself was a masterpiece, skillfully woven with intricate details, unexpected twists, and emotionally charged moments that resonated long after the game concluded. The storytelling prowess on display was truly extraordinary, making it a standout among the myriad of games I've played. The music, another integral aspect, contributed significantly to the game's immersive atmosphere. The well-composed soundtrack enhanced emotional beats, underscored intense moments, and seamlessly complemented the unfolding story, leaving a lasting impression on the overall gaming experience. It stands out as one of the best games I've played, and the desire to revisit the journey, to once again immerse myself in its narrative and relish the exceptional music, speaks volumes about its lasting impact.

This game has earned a place among my all-time favorites, not just for its technical excellence, but for the profound emotional connection it fostered through its exceptional protagonist, masterful storytelling, and a musical score that resonated deeply with the essence of the narrative.

I cannot say how much I personally love this game and hope anyone out there curious if they should give it a shot to definitely do so. The storytelling is astonishingly great. throughout it all I kept smiling and getting exiting for whats next to come. Usually with open world games I find exploring the world or going off doing other stuff kinda a chore however this is not the case with this game. I find myself loving just going around doing other stuff besides the main quest line. Not many open world games succeed in this in my own opinion.

Although for some, The difficulty might be a little much for some people however if you are willing to commit and push through and make it till the end you wont be disappointed. I love it and sure hope more people out there is willing to give the game a shot. Its far more than just ""hot android lady with big thighs"" that some people might assume the series is at a glance.

Amazing, unique & beautifully depressing main story with side quests that are genuinely impactful atory-wise, most are worth doing to expand on the world.

Gameplay seamlessly switches between a few different genres, the two most prominent being hack & slash and bullet hell. 

Classic Platinum Games combat, all weapon varieties and attack chains flow together in a satisfying way that makes experimenting with weapon combos fun and rewarding.

OST, among the best along with the first Nier

One of the best games of the 2010s.

I'll only recommend Nier Automata if you are determined to get the full experience up to Ending E. Otherwise don't bother.

The first route (run) is only half of the game... And you'll have to redo that first half without much change to unlock the rest of the story with a third route... I don't think that was a good idea. The game itself proves that the second route could be fused with the first one. Also try to do the side quests as much as you can, they are better than the main quests for the most part with better atmosphere setting.

Speaking about design choices... Nier gameplay sucks. Everything is tedious and feels like a chore. Combat is dull and pods have an unnecessary amount of focus.

However there are some highlights. Nier is also a semi-meta game. Don't expect anything like Stanley Parable but there are some nice bits... which is the reason why this game is praised this much. Along with the deep lore coming from Drakengard and the awesome OST sung on ""Chaos Language"".

Developed by PlatinumGames and published by Square Enix, this action RPG released in 2017 has left an indelible mark on the gaming community with its thought-provoking narrative and mesmerizing world.

Storyline and Characters: 
Set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has been driven to the brink of extinction by alien invaders, NieR: Automata introduces players to an android named 2B, alongside her companion 9S, as they fight to reclaim Earth for humanity. The storyline delves into themes of existentialism, consciousness, and the nature of humanity itself. As the narrative unfolds, players are taken on an emotional rollercoaster, encountering a diverse cast of characters, each with their own struggles and motivations. The depth of character development and the intricacy of the storyline contribute to an immersive experience that resonates long after the credits roll.

Visuals and Atmosphere: 
Visually stunning, NieR: Automata features beautifully crafted environments that range from desolate landscapes to futuristic cities, each meticulously designed to evoke a sense of wonder and despair. The game's art direction is complemented by a hauntingly atmospheric soundtrack, composed by Keiichi Okabe, which adds layers of emotion and intensity to every moment of gameplay. From the eerie silence of abandoned ruins to the adrenaline-fueled battles against towering machines, the game's visuals and atmosphere work in perfect harmony to create an unforgettable experience.

Gameplay and Combat: 
At its core, NieR: Automata offers fast-paced action combat that seamlessly transitions between melee and ranged attacks. Players control 2B as she gracefully maneuvers through hordes of enemies with precision and fluidity. The combat system is deep and rewarding, allowing for a variety of playstyles and strategies. Additionally, the game features RPG elements such as leveling up, customizable upgrades, and a diverse arsenal of weapons that keep the gameplay fresh and engaging throughout.
Beyond its combat mechanics, NieR: Automata introduces innovative gameplay elements that challenge traditional gaming conventions. From bullet-hell sequences to platforming sections and even text-based adventures, the game constantly surprises and delights players with its creativity and ingenuity. These moments of gameplay diversity serve to enrich the overall experience, ensuring that no two moments in NieR: Automata feel the same.

Replayability and Endings: 
One of the most remarkable aspects of NieR: Automata is its branching narrative structure, which offers multiple endings based on the player's choices and actions throughout the game. Each playthrough reveals new layers of the story, encouraging players to explore different paths and uncover hidden truths about the world they inhabit. The game's replayability is further enhanced by its New Game Plus mode, which allows players to carry over their progress and discover additional secrets that may have eluded them on their first playthrough.

Conclusion:

From its captivating narrative and memorable characters to its breathtaking visuals and innovative design, every aspect of the game is crafted with meticulous care and attention to detail.

The very end of the game is something truly special. If I were to compile a list of 10 most unique and influential games I've ever played, NieR: Automata would definitely be on that list. It's an awesome blend of smooth action, ranging from a third person hack n' slash/shooter, to a top down shooter and an occasional 2D platformer, with solid RPG elements, delivering a story that still resonates with me years after finishing the game. And although it sounds pretty weird (which it is), it makes for one tasty Japanese dish. Just writing this review makes me want to go back and re-experience the game again.

The way combat works is ridiculously satisfying, the soundtrack is incredible, and it has some amazing storytelling that's weaved into the gameplay. The side quests are exceptionally well-written even if they're not super interesting mechanically.

The only real downsides are that, for an ARPG, there's not a lot of interesting progression. Levels are basically only for stats, and you'll have most of the abilities in the game within easy reach before you roll credits the first time around 1/3 of the way through the game. The game's also on the easy side. If you do too many of the side quests (and given how cool the narrative beats are, you likely will) then you'll end up fairly overleveled going into the main plot, and there's not much interesting resource management regarding items and such.

Regardless, this is still a game that I'd recommend everyone play through to the final credits before accepting the game's last request. And then maybe play it a second time.

Also, you'll see a lot of older reviews bemoaning bugs and issues with the port. This game got a patch a few years ago, and I played through the game more than once without a hitch.

The story is excellent, with it's multiple endings building ontop of each other, and giving you more info about the whole world with each playthrough. Beeing diverse in moods, surroundings and characters, makes the game feeling really big and perfectly ballanced, while also not letting out the fanservice. i would go as far as saying, it is a 10/10 game. 

The only bad part about is the PC port itself. When released it was poorly optimized, and thus really laggy. The controls with mouse and keyboard weren't especially good either. In the meantime there were a few updates and Patches, so that the game runs well, but the controlls did not change much to the favor of the game.

People who haven't played this yet - you have no clue what you are about to experience. It's so insanely cerebral and bizarre, but completely coherent and beautiful. [i]""Haha 2B's panties lulz""[/i]. No. This game is Yoko Taro's fever dream of an exploration of what it means to be a sentient and feeling being. Automata spends 30+ hours building up a group of lovable, morally righteous characters and then proceeds to strip them of everything they have and emotionally deconstruct them, all while the entire reality of the world they exist within is constantly being peeled away layer by layer, exposing more and more of the grand conspiracy deep under the surface until eventually it's like there's nothing left but the choice to either see the beauty in it anyway or let it all destroy you in rage. Shit's fucking nuts. It goes hard.

As far as gameplay - it's excellent. One of the best action games ever. 2B and A2 both control beautifully and look badass in combat, it's all wildly fluid with flowing animations between every possible action and tons of special animations for very specific attack chains, it makes combat feel really visceral. The movesets are a perfect balance of complexity and simplicity, dodging is extremely satisfying, and the constant subgame of simultaneously controlling your pod is very satisfying and unique. 9S is fun to play as too, but his gameplay is mainly comprised of a very slick and engaging series of little twin stick shooter style minigames that escalate in difficulty perfectly. I mean this is the team that makes Bayonetta - of course the game is fun to play.

And finally the soundtrack. This is one of the greatest soundtracks ever, for anything. Seriously, Incredible.

I don't even know what else to say. Anything negative I could say is nit picky. This is a game I'll never forget.

P.S. - For anyone who needs to hear this, the first time you beat the game? Yeah, you didn't beat the game, not even close. Load that save up again. Yoko Taro is a weird dude.",1705751590,1705751590,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

9th April, 2023: Stopped playing the game as there's literally nothing else for me to do, did all the content this has to offer, will play again some day for sure, it is a must.

August 3rd, 2023: Still thinking about this game almost on a daily basis, still don't know what do I live for. The anime was cool, even though it was slightly different but with the same results when it comes to plots, sad that it didn't caught the emotion the game offers, but I was already expecting that from the anime.

October 29th, 2023: Out of the blue, I just remembered that I forgot to mention a mod that I used to be able to play with keyboard+mouse in a proper manner: NAIOM. This mod solves the input issues as well as other little things regarding the controls in the game. It also allows you to re-bind trivial keys that in the game you can't. You can find the mod in the nexusmods website as well as guides in Steam.

December 16th, 2023: 1-2 months ago I didn't have internet connection at home so I decided to play some NieR:Automata offline... total playtime after the session: 112h; still makes me sad... uninstalled NieR:Automata and bought NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139... to dive deeper into the lore.

January 7th, 2024: Finished NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139...'s story a few days ago, a lot has been answered, and even more questions showed up. Between the two games, I don't know which one is the saddest, maybe both together, because they complement each other. I am now doing what is left to attain 100% in it.

January 19th, 2024: Finished the last achievement in NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139... tonight, and although I'm sad it ended, I am happy it happened. I am now consuming every side material I can get my hands on at the moment, I personally can't get enough of the NieR's universe (call me addicted all you like, I don't care).

Stylish art direction, tight controls, one of the best game soundtracks I've ever heard (probably second only to the original NieR), and a mature, twisty story that will keep you guessing. I think this game is best described as an action game with heavy JRPG influences. I guess you could also say it's an action RPG, but however you want to classify it, it's a stylish and slick action game with a really cool story. 

There is a lot to of content to dive into here. This game is intended to be played through multiple times, but one great thing about this game is that you could honestly just play through the main story with the primary ending, and you would still have get an awesome game experience ...But if you do that, you would really be missing out on some great stuff. 

Like it's predecessor, it takes a lot of game design cues from other genres, also like it's predecessor, not every idea is a home run, there are a few annoying design choices here and there, but it still all works. I honestly wouldn't change a thing. 

From the opening moments in this game, it becomes pretty clear that this game is probably not what you expect. In fact that's how I recommend anyone experience this game: go in blind, don't follow any guides, and stop watching game play videos. Just experience this game organically and be ready for an incredible ride. I really can't overstate how awesome this game is.",1705542935,1705542935,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Core gameplay is fluid, and while it is button mashy, it's fun to me personally. Reminds me of Devil May Cry, Dynasty Warriors, etc. I don't particularly enjoy the side-scrolling, diet bullet hell sections when you pilot aerial units; it just doesn't compare to the melee combat at all, but it's serviceable. 

The story is overrated and predictable in my opinion. It is a trite retelling of the work of several notable French philosophers, with none of the weight or significance of the former. The characters are all significantly underwritten and derivative. 2B and 9S are cookie-cutter protagonists that I struggle to feel any kind of emotional connection towards. The writing simply does not give you a reason to, and their personalities certainly don't either. The game tries to build up to emotional moments, but without properly likable or fleshed out characters, it falls flat.

It was recommended to me by my good friend Skillup ;), who was full of praise over this game. However, when I played through path A and B, although definitely enjoyed it so far, I had some complaints as well, so my opinions didn't align with Skillup's yet at this point; the prologue, with it's hour long first level without save points, sort of forced me to start with a Normal difficulty play-through, which wasn't challenging enough beyond the prologue in retrospect. I also wasn't a fan of 9S, not his design and not his play style. Furthermore I didn't really think the relationship between 2B and 9S was very well developed making the dramatic conclusion fall on deaf ears a bit. The combat was enjoyable, but I wasn't really too engaged with it either, most likely because I'm not much of a hack and slash fan or a twin stick shooter fan for that matter. Most of all I didn't like Adam and Eve. Too contrived and not that original or interesting. Throughout my time with path A and B, I was a little bit disappointed, but still eager to play on.

Then the more the game continued after path A and B, the more my enjoyment grew, with every new layer of depth, so grew the quality. In the end all this had formed a whole that was so well put together, that all my complaints diminished, or entirely disappeared. 

In the end I just kept on wanting more; more side quests, more twists, more cinematics, more time with 2B. I understand now why reviewing games you're so passionate about is so difficult. Your thoughts aren't structured, you're overwhelmed, it's not one detail that makes a game good, it's quality seeps out of every line of dialogue, every objective, every animation, character model, every event, etc... 

I love this game. There's not enough characters left to explain why. I honestly wouldn't know where to go on with...

With that rant out of the way, it's really a bad game. All side quests are just filler and you have to play them, otherwise you're under-level and can't play main missions properly. I consider them filler because they're all the same: go talk to A which asks you to deliver message to B (which is ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MAP); the worst offender: escort A to B (I REALLY hate those ones, because A is REALLY slow). The port, as said in the first paragraph, is just plain bad. You know it's bad when the community recommends A LOT of mods to play the game properly. The game also stutters frequently when moving around the map (Cyberpunk 2077 really spoiled me in this regard, that game's asset streaming just works).

I guess the main missions and lore are the only ""good"" things this game has. And ""NG+"" has a cool concept to it. Though I can't recommend it for the price I paid (16‚Ç¨) ESPECIALLY on PC.",1705178903,1705178903,False,1,3,0.456000000238418579,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- The spectacle is a highlight and really cool
- Cool world design
- Game play variation (Flight Unit + Hack and Slash)
- Music is unique but not very catchy (still cool tho)
Cons:
-The difficulty is bullshit just play this on easy if you don't want the stress
-The story has to be the most overblown piece of media ever
    -Lack of character interactions and character in general its all so one dimensional and simple
    - To beat the main story it takes 40 long ass hours way too much for such a simple story
    - I came expecting an existential crisis but i honestly didn't care for the characters so it didn't really make me cry or feel
-The game is too long in general most of that time is from the open world which is too big for such a simple story it drags on and that's without me even doing the side quests or getting the other endings. The game play also starts getting old around 30 hours in,
Overall:
This game is not the masterpiece people claim it to be and that's ok its still fun but why tf are people saying they cried over this, what is there to cry about. The androids barley talked to each other and some of the emotions seemed forced almost to make you feel bad. All 4 main endings were just bad and I had hopes after each it would get better but it never did. Ending A: barley a conclusion, Ending B: same as ending A, Ending C: Didn't feel earned and made me feel nothing. Ending E: Didn't feel nothing. If you play this, play it for the game play, music, and spectacle not the story. I was left severely underwhelmed.",1705177689,1705177689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Set in a post-apocalyptic world where androids combat machines, the game takes players on an emotional rollercoaster, exploring profound existential themes that transcend typical gaming experiences.

The storytelling is nothing short of extraordinary. The narrative unfolds in unexpected ways, with layers of complexity that delve into the nature of humanity and the meaning of existence. The characters, particularly 2B, 9S, and A2, are beautifully crafted, each contributing to a storyline that is both heartbreaking and uplifting.

The combat mechanics are a true highlight, offering a perfect fusion of fluidity and depth. Engaging in battles feels like a dance, with melee and ranged attacks seamlessly transitioning to create a visually stunning spectacle. The diverse arsenal of weapons and the strategic depth in combat customization provide an ever-evolving gameplay experience.

One cannot discuss NieR: Automata without acknowledging its phenomenal soundtrack. Keiichi Okabe's musical score is a work of art, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene. The dynamically adaptive music adds an extra layer of immersion, making each moment unforgettable.

While the open-world segments may feel somewhat sparse to some, the overall design choices contribute to the game's uniqueness. NieR: Automata challenges traditional gaming norms, opting for a more unconventional approach that pays off in creating a distinctive and memorable experience.

This game is not merely a form of entertainment; it's a profound journey that lingers in your thoughts long after completion. NieR: Automata is a testament to the artistic potential of video games, offering a rare combination of storytelling, gameplay, and music that elevates it to the status of a true masterpiece.

Is there something crucially important about the empathy we share for these objects as the reality of a seemingly uncaring world seeps in?

NieR Automata is many things to me and is many things narratively, no game has won my heart like the NieR series has and none have since. I could spend literal hours talking about how much of Nier is about the things that feed conflict and why they happen despite our best interests, despite what we know is 'right', and the desire to break that cycle of conflict, even when it's too late to stop. It's about an infatuating love between two people who also want to kill each other, it's about the mistakes of ancestors creating countless misery for their descendants. It's about language/culture barriers creating monsters where there is none. It's about personification of non-living beings that desperately want to be alive. About the death of god(s) and how we cope with that. It's about sacrifice and what your willing to do to see this world's end and for others to do the same. It's many things and I adore all of it.

Emil and 9S are probably my favorite written characters in the medium of video games and I hope that can be usurped someday. 2B (and hell most of Taro's characters) is a tragic character that just wants to not hurt the one she loves despite needing to countless times, I hope she has a wonderful life with 9S at the end of the game as much as the world of Automata will let her have, which it's ending is left up to mostly interpretation. I will never understand people who write off 2B as a no-note character with only a fat ass to keep her relevant. Eitherway, I adore this game and have 100%ed it, I can't wait to see what Taro does next if at all.

[u] Spoilers ahead, so be warned. [/u] 

I just finished Part A. This game port is a hot mess. Random screen shutters and FPS drops, horrible Controls and Settings that lacking destroy any immersion that could exist while playing. The combat, when working, and story was decent so far, but that's about it for the positives.

Recommendations / Tips if you are willing to buy the game on PC:
1) Download NAIOM if you are planning to play with Mouse and Keyboard - Without this mod, i would have refunded this game 100%. (Just google it)
2) This PC port is not worth full price - get it on a SALE.
3) 100% Play with a Controller (XInput - only type the game supports by default)
4) IMHO the DLC is a cash grab, don't waste your money on it.

[u] EDIT:  [/u]  
Just finished Part B. Can be summed up as Arkanoid / Galaga Hacker Android edition. Story was actually more interesting. Provides a lot more back story from the Robots perspective / point of view.

When you first play this game it's fantastic and you go through Route A.
Not everything is explained at first and your expecting that because you know Routes B and C are coming.
You complete (A) and then begin (B) and slowly start to realise the games making you play the exact same game you just played and completed....but again...only this time with uninteresting 9S.

It promises to tell you more of the story but what it actually does is give you maybe 20% different scenes that could easily have been put into 2Bs (A) route. It feels like a cheap trick to force you to play as 9S and clock up more play time for what is essentially just 30 minutes of different scenes/content.

My playtime was 45hours. Without doing 9Ss (B) route that probably would only have been 32 hours since the game forces you to redo everything.

You then get A2 (C) route...only it's not just A2 because the game forces you to play as 9S for half of her story.

-----Spoilers-----

This then boils down to an ending were the twins die, Yorha  is destroyed, the machine life form splits personality and fights itself (never explains this or which side actually won the argument) then that the final fight is between A2 and 9S were both die, the machine network launches a shuttle into space to find a new world (WHY!? they literally say they want to be/know what humans are/were and yet leave), it never states if all the machines left on Earth switch off after this or stay alive to form a new separate network or to be disconnected like what Pascal was.

The final part is a battle were you have to fight the credits as a hacking shuttle. Then a 3 minute scene just showing the pods getting parts to rebuild the 3 androids (Where are these specialists parts coming from and when did the Pods become engineers/mechanics) and.....that's it.....

No explanation on alot of stuff and other things left open ended without any conclusion. 
It just feels like an empty ending which had an opportunity to be incredible but just flat without any bang.

Pros:
Combat is fun.
Characters are interesting.
Story is captivating.
World is pretty.
Lots of missions.
2Bs ass is hypnotic.

Cons:
Lots of running around.
Lots of back tracking.
Lots of questions never answered.
Twins die needlessly.
Game makes you replay route A but as 9S.
A2 could have been fleshed out more.

All in all, an incredible experience. It hits harder emotionally than Undertale while having incredible graphics, great gameplay, and one of the best soundtracks of all time (possibly my favorite soundtrack ever).

If I were to give one critique, it's gameplay has a few flaws and feels a bit easy, at least on normal mode. Due to abilities like auto heal and healing when an enemy is defeated, by the time you are at the late game it almost feels like the fights/bosses are easier than the early game. These easy fights are a bit narratively dissonant with the tense and emotional moments in the story. This isn't too bad because you can always change the difficulty, just a minor nitpick.

I recommend this game to everyone. It's story, action, music, and art make it one of the best games of all time.

And if you disagree (btw I just went there to see if i understood the quintessence of the story and never interacted there so it didnt affect me personally but those poor guys who did... omg xD) they will simply tell them that they are stupid or that they just don¬¥t get it LMAO.

Gameplay wise: So many different genres mixed but everything feels like 10% of what it should have been.

Invisible walls everywhere in an open world game! wanna jump over a half wall to get to the other side? Well fuck you and your ambitions, better take the long way and walk all the way around!

The map is so bad they ""made"" it a feature that an NPC tells you how bad it actually is because it¬¥s only designed to guide you around...? So in a world were technology is that advanced that they have machnines which resamble humans to a degree of almost 100% they can¬¥t have a proper maps?

Side quests are either: Go there and kill x amount of y or gather a amount of b. 
and there are tons of them and sometimes you have to make multiple trips to the same NPC,

Seriously the game is trash, I got the game of the year (Yorha) edition for 15 Euros and i would not have played it, even if you payed me 15 Euros, if i knew how bad it was.

Btw 20% of people who got the game finished it on steam so go figure how ""good"" it is!

Thx for coming to my TED-talk on why this game is poopoo.",1704729492,1704729492,False,7,1,0.490578800439834595,0,True,False,False

Automata is the only game that I have played in the series, as I have never played Replicant or any other Nier games before. I think Nier Automata is a good game, yet it might be slightly overhyped by the media and the community. 

First and foremost, this is not a triple-A title and you cannot expect a huge investment into the quality and the design of the game. In fact, as a game that is released for almost 7 years, the graphics do show its age. Afterall, the PC version of Automata was ported from PS4, still you can expect a smooth and stable gameplay after being patched a few years back.

The story plot should be the biggest highlight here, as the game is frequently praised by its unorthodox story-telling. This is not a straight forward story, even a strange, eccentric, confusing story at times. I remember when I finished the game, I had to watch a 10-minute video explaining the key points of the story to clear the fog. The story might seem too complicated and I am a bit reserved in the application of philosophical content into the story. Sometimes these ideas seem to force its way into the story, which brings unusual development to the plot. Though the game might not tell my favourite story, the gameplay is nice and creative. The shift in perspectives in the game, from 3D to 2D, to the mini hacking game, are innovations that offers a lot of freshness to the game. Combat is also smooth and decent.

Overall, Nier Automata is a nice game, but do not over-expect. The game may be one of its own kind, yet some of the innovations it brought requires better execution. It is an interesting experience to finish the game and I would certainly recommend playing it to discover and experience the game yourself.",1704727124,1704727124,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PLEASE JUST PLAY ON NORMAL difficulty; if you are not as skillful in the hack and slash as me, I died in the tutorial several times, and then I lowered the difficulty to keep my sanity intact, lol.

What I really like:
1. How ""Alive"" the characters are, even the NPC/side character. You can feel their character development as you progress throughout the game and learn about their past.
2. 2B Japanese Voice ""Nani"" at 9S Nagging.
3. I Lost a lot of progress because of some random Mackarel...Damn you, Jackaass!
4. The story itself feels natural and humane. It does not force the player to believe in something. We care because we feel included in their journey.
5. Do You like DMC hack and slash? Yeah, smash those buttons and slash all the enemies.
6. You don't have to read the journal/secret document you found; most of the main points related to the plot are summarized by our character (dubbing).

The negative:
1. this is not a negative for all people, but if you like the linearity of a story, then this game is probably not for you, there are 26 endings, with 6 of them being the main ending (?) and 20 of them are jokes ending that may or may not have a correlation to the main story.
2. lock at 60 fps, but i dont find it makes my experience worsen
3. Sometimes, it feels like playing bullet hell if you find yourself dealing with dozens of gunner enemies/elites.

Well, I don't really have more negative things to say about this game; the game is absolutely beautiful: the characters, the voice acting, the world, and the story. I'm glad to play and finish this game.

I hope you guys have the same wonderful experience. Cheers!",1704611191,1704611579,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Die Geschichte und das Lore sind ebenfalls sehr gut, auch wenn sehr dystopistisch. Jedoch mag ich wie es erz√§hlt wird und wie der Spieler das ganze erlebt.

I played all of the side quests because I genuinely wanted to see what would happen; I didn't even notice or care about the rewards. I'm listening to the soundtrack as I write this, and I'll probably keep listening to it forever. I even did some fishing.

It made me laugh, it made me sad, it made me actually cover my mouth in shock like I was in an old timey film.

NieR:Automata is one of the best narrative driven JRPGs I have ever played, There is simply no other franchise or game in the genre that is quite like the NieR games. Though I prefer Replicant in a narrative and character perspective, Automata excels more in its gameplay and also tells a phenomenal story of the meaning of life.

It you even just remotely like JRPGs and have not dived in, you are doing yourself a disservice.

If I was to explain exactly what Nier Automota was, and how the story and interconnecting pathways worked, it would probably put you off. It might seem convoluted, or too complicated or like a game that isn't fun and is just pretentious for the sake of being pretentious. 

To put it into simple terms, this is an action-heavy, guns-a-blazing, sword-a-swinging RPG. It's gameplay is a blend of a bullet hell mixed with anime-heavy (aka quick, fast, furious) real-time combat which turns this game into... A bullet slasher? I don't know how to describe it. Regardless, it's incredibly fun. Combat is satisfying to engage in, it's always intense and every battle feels like a proper battle, which you, the player, conquered and survived. Of course, gameplay is intermixed with a lot of talking (typical of any JRPG) and cutscenes which will showcase the story to you, a lot of running around, admiring the beautiful, forgotten landscape of a dystopian, war-torn earth, and some... Other, 8-bit inspired shooter gameplay which I won't really talk about. 

Frankly, I don't really want to talk about the gameplay in this game. Sure, it's great... Nothing that blew me away though. It's not really going to have people's jaws dropping. Because really, this is more like a philosophical tale shown to you with gameplay attached to it. What Nier brings to the table first and foremost, is an incredibly gripping story which cements it as an all-time, if not the all-time great in gaming storytelling.

I just want to summarise my playing experience with this game. This was a game which had me thinking it was really good, to really great, to a masterpiece. There's simply nothing quite like Nier Automota. This games goes places with it's story other developers and storytellers would simply be afraid to go to, and it tackles topics to the core, rather than just scraping over the surface, like many modern games do. I highly, highly encourage everyone to play this game at least once in their life, because it's the type of game that is life changing, and will make you think about life in a different perspective to the one you saw it through before playing. If you want a game that is mechanically good and feels fun to play, this is definitely a good game in that regard, but if you disregard the rest of the game you really are going to waste your time.

[b]Note:[/b] this review does not contain any story spoilers.

For many years, it was marred by a poor PC port. However, on July 15th, 2021, the game's fundamental technical issues were addressed, and it is finally a game I can wholly recommend. The gamepad controls are tighter and more response, tools like FAR (Fix Automata Resolution) are no longer required for play (modding is still supported so these tools have use but were previously required for a (technical) vanilla experience) and in my entire 100% playthrough, I ran into zero crashes. [i]NieR:Automata‚Ñ¢[/i] is both a narrative masterpiece, and a competent PC port as of its final update.

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
The game has you assume the role of 2B, 9S & A2, three YorHA units whose skillsets are fairly unique. The gameplay, both in terms of how you play and how you progress the narrative, is structured around its five core endings, labeled A-C. Each playthrough is unique, and you won't simply be repeating the game to reach a choice screen that allows you a different option. Rather, each time you complete a primary ending, you start anew from a fresh perspective, having both the narrative take on a new angle, as well as the gameplay, through the character you play.

Combat in [i][b]NieR:Automata‚Ñ¢[/b][/i] is hack-n-slash style, slicing and dicing through enemies around you. You have two weapons slots, either of which can be equipped to use a variety of light & heavy weapon types. The first slot is for Light attacks, the second for Heavy. Combos in the game consist of various numbers of Light + Heavy attacks in rhythmic succession. Each weapon in the game details its Light / Heavy combos in simple numeric fashion.

Augmenting the combat in the game is the Plug-in Chips system. Offensive, Defensive, Support & Utility chips which can be plugged into any of the characters to aid in your gameplay. You're allotted a limited number of points for equipping chips, and the better a chip is, the more points it will take. For example, a chip which increases your damage by 20% will require more points than a chip which increases your max HP by 5%. Chips can also be combined to level them up, creating better chips which consequently cost more points to equip. This is called Fusing.

Finally, we have Pods. They're small robots that follow you around and can be equipped with tools to aid you in combat. From Gatling guns to lasers to sonars which detect nearby hidden items, the Pods serve both an offensive & utilitarian purpose in the game. They have both a primary & secondary fire functionality, where the secondary fire is based off of the currently equipped skill. These are much more powerful, albeit at the cost of a modest cooldown. Pods are also closely intertwined with the narrative.

Outside of the hack-n-slash combat, you'll also face sequences of bullet hell-style gameplay, as well as brief ""hacking"" minigames. These are typically brief, though hacking plays a much more prominent role later on.

The gameplay is structured around several zones, all of which will be fast travel-accessible by midgame. Each zone will have its denizens offering side quests that you can optionally complete as you progress the main story. The main story will also take you through all of the zones, so you won't miss any areas of the game as you follow its narrative.

Each of the three characters in the game play in different styles, though 9S is very different, where 2B and A2 are somewhat similar. Each of the three primary endings (A-C) will offer you a unique spin on the game.

[h1][b]Story[/b][/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] I'm intentionally keeping this section of the review bare and focusing on the technical aspects of the Endings system because I wish to avoid spoilers. The narrative in this game is worth going through blind.

Arguably, the narrative of [i][b]NieR:Automata‚Ñ¢[/b][/i] is its strongest suit. The gameplay is solid and satisfying, but the story is something else altogether.

Told through its three primary endings, the actual ""final ending"" can be found through Ending E, which is unlockable very quickly after completing Ending C, as only Endings A-C require full playthroughs of the game. Ending A sees the game through the eyes of 2B, where Ending B is 9S and Ending C is A2. Endings D is the closest to a ""choice screen"" style ending, but once A-D have been completed, E becomes available and will tie up the game in a fantastic fashion, making for a breathtaking closing.

While this sounds overwhelming, the formula is as follows:
[olist]
[*]Finishing Ending A
[*]Finish Ending B
[*]Finish Ending C/D
[*]Finish Ending C/D (What wasn't chosen above)
[*]Finish Ending E
[/olist]
After completing the game for the third time (and unlocking Ending C/D, depending on choice) you will gain access to Chapter Select, allowing you to jump to the final sequence of the game and make the other choice. By doing this, you will unlock Ending E and see the final narrative of the game, which is absolutely incredible.

The game in total has 26 ""endings,"" though only A-E close with proper credits. The rest can be unlocked at various parts in the game, both in humorous and creative fashions. After a non-primary ending is unlocked, you simply reload at your most recent save and continue.

[h1][b]Performance[/b][/h1]
[i][b]NieR:Automata‚Ñ¢[/b][/i] targets a locked 60 FPS and is hard capped at this framerate due to physics being tied to the framerate. While disappointing at first, I was able to quickly adjust to this, and the game is rock stable on decent hardware. At no point did I encounter any bugs/glitches, I never dipped below 60 FPS, and through my entire playthrough, the game didn't crash a single time. The settings menu is modest with decent confugration, and it still looks rather pretty by today's standards. This can be helped with higher resolution texture mods as well.

[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]
I 100% completed this game in around 65 hours. If you're only in it for the narrative, it can be completed in 25-35 hours, depending on your style of play. This was a fantastic experience from start to finish and is now among my favorite games of all time. If you're a fan of third-person hack-n-slash games or of JRPGs, this is a must-buy.",1663289010,1704482190,True,27,0,0.760987699031829834,0,True,False,False

There is no angle that this game can be viewed upon in which its unending perfection is not crystal clear. It is the embodiment of a video game, and yet, one of the most thought provoking pieces of media I have ever had the joy of experiencing. It's equal parts hack and slash, bullethell, twin stick shooter, and open zone RPG yet it holds itself together effortlessly forming one of the most coherent experiences to date.

The combat is fluid, and each of the three playable characters differentiate themselves in such a way that experiencing every route just for more gameplay worth it. However, do know, that once those credits roll for the first time, you are all but required to go back and experience Endings B through E. Never have I seen alternate endings enhance an experience to such a degree, and never have those endings kept exceeding even my wildest of expectations.

The game contains expertly crafted meta-commentary on everything from minor aspects of the games industry, to thoroughly crafted examinations of the human experience, life, and love lost. It's story is engaging from the very beginning, and will only sink its teeth in deeper as time progresses.

Lastly, from a technical standpoint, this game is a marvel. Every issue lamented regarding the PC port appears to have been ironed out, with stellar visuals that have aged like a fine wine. Steam Deck support is stellar at a near locked sixty frames per second, without compromising on visuals. When playing at the desktop, the game supports Ultrawide resolutions flawlessly.

Gameplay is mostly about smashing buttons and I really don't like the combos. I just evade and hit and maintain shooting continuously and that does it. Initially, I liked the sequences mimicking other old genres like side-scrollers with the flying unit, but these genere and camera changes are a bit abused and I got bored quickly. I hate running around the map with no fast travel in sight (i checked and it is given mid game, but I just don't have it in me to make it there). Characters feel repetitive and a bit bland, and so does the game per se. If you check online, you'll see that it is based on multiple playthroughs with you repeating a lot of stuff and doing some new things. No way I would go through that when I'm already feeling it repetitive 3 hours in. 

One thing I have to praise is the score. I'll remember getting to the machine village with everyone waving a white flag while that cute music is playing.

The running and the running and more running.  No fast travel.  No speed up time.  Then I do some digging.  80% of this game is running.  And apparently there are different endings?  And it needs to be played 5 times.  The parts where you actually get to play are great.  Omg the running.  And the running is done in completely empty areas.  It‚Äôs like running around in an abandoned mall.  I‚Äôm glad I got this one sale.  I might watch the game movie on YouTube.  This is a question for the devs, what is wrong with you?  What possessed you to make a 3rd person running simulation interspersed with game play?  Really?  I don‚Äôt recommend this game.  Watch the game movie on YouTube.

How much drudgery to I have to drag myself through until I do? The combat is okay, the world is empty, and the storytelling was oversold. Got halfway through my second playthrough until I realized I was spending more time doing the equivalent of chores than enjoying myself. I know that the main draw of this is supposed to be the story, but it got repetitive fast with how predictable the story can be. Admittedly, there are some moments in the story that genuinely grabbed my interest, but compared to the hours spent walking from quest to quest miles apart from another, fighting the same few kinds of enemies, and the tropes the characters fell into more often than not, I couldn't continue. And was it really necessary to drag me through ANOTHER playthrough from another POV just for slight additions to the story? I can't understand what got the game so hyped up, even if I can see some good in it.

PlatinumGames and Yoko Taro have collaborated to craft an unforgettable experience that seamlessly blends action-packed gameplay with a deeply emotional narrative.

Graphics (9/10):
The visual presentation of NieR: Automata is nothing short of stunning. From the desolate, war-torn landscapes to the meticulously designed character models, every aspect of the game's graphics contributes to its atmospheric brilliance. However, occasional texture pop-ins and minor framerate dips keep it from a perfect score.

Sound and Music (10/10):
Keiichi Okabe's hauntingly beautiful score enhances the emotional depth of NieR: Automata. The dynamic music that shifts seamlessly with the gameplay adds an extra layer to the overall experience. The voice acting is exceptional, capturing the essence of each character with authenticity.

Story and Narrative (10/10):
Yoko Taro's storytelling prowess shines in NieR: Automata, delivering a narrative that transcends the boundaries of conventional video game plots. The intertwining stories of 2B, 9S, and A2, coupled with existential themes, create a thought-provoking and emotionally charged experience. The multiple endings encourage replayability, each offering a new perspective on the narrative.

Gameplay (9/10):
The combat mechanics in NieR: Automata are a symphony of fluidity and intensity. The combination of fast-paced action, diverse weapon types, and the hacking minigame adds depth to the gameplay. However, occasional camera issues and repetitive side quests slightly hinder the overall experience.

World Design (8/10):
The open-world structure of NieR: Automata is ambitious, but the execution falls short in certain aspects. While the interconnected environments contribute to a sense of scale, the lack of diversity in the landscapes and some bland textures diminish the overall impact.

Character Development (10/10):
NieR: Automata's characters are its beating heart. The journey of 2B, 9S, and A2 is a rollercoaster of emotions, with each character undergoing significant development. The connection forged between the player and the android protagonists is a testament to the game's narrative brilliance.

Replayability (9/10):
The multiple endings and hidden secrets make NieR: Automata highly replayable. Each playthrough reveals new layers of the story, encouraging players to explore different choices and outcomes. However, some may find certain sections repetitive in subsequent runs.

Overall (9.5/10):
NieR: Automata is a magnum opus that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming. Its emotionally charged narrative, coupled with stellar visuals and an unforgettable soundtrack, makes it a must-play for fans of the medium.",1640487774,1704052697,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Games are intended to create an experience that involves the player deeply and on all levels. Games are aimed at leaving memories that feel alive, real and personal. Sadly, not every game is a game. Gladly, Nier: Automata is a game. Probably, it is THE game. The game you ought to play to understand what games are capable of.

I hated Nier: Automata for 18 hours straight. I struggled to play. I did not understand why I even bought the damn thing and spent hours reading guides and trying to make this horrible piece of software work and not crash. But there was something... something I couldn't quite put my finger on at the time. Something that kept me returning to the game.

Games are often praised for their story, or graphics, or music, or gameplay... But it is not the story, nor the graphics, nor the gameplay, nor even the music that makes N:A a masterpiece... But it is the story, and the graphics, and the gameplay, and the music that make N:A a masterpiece. For it manages to create a wonderfully cohesive experience where every separate piece is meaningless on its own, but all the pieces fit together perfectly to form an amazing whole.

Everything has meaning. Even my 18 hours long suffering. Especially my 18 hours long suffering.

If you ever wanted to experience a game as a truly interactive medium, a holistic and unique experience you cannot possibly get by any other means, do yourself a favor and play Nier: Automata. You might regret it. You will not regret it.

PS ""I walked the same path... And there's one thing I want you to remember... Never give up!"" I am Ghost--a faithful player of Nier: Automata. And one day we will meet.

Update:

Five years later the game is still a technical disaster and is still unplayable with KB&M because of the hardcoded double-tap dash and overall clunky KB&M camera and combat controls. It was never addressed. The only way PC players can play the game using their native PC controls is a fan-made NAIOM mod. And that one currently relies on an outdated and unsafe library, i.e. is basically unusable.

Since 2017 over 7.5 million copies of the game were sold. It's not a huge number, but not a small one either. How much does it cost to add just one missing binding? It's not a rocket science, it was done by modders and it's even easier to do by devs.

Me from 2018 was willing to give it a pass, grab a controller and install the whole zoo of fan-made fixes (the famous white screen issue + other troubles). I gave a positive and inspired review nonetheless, but now I realize that I shouldn't have done it, because in the end it was a disservice to future me, other players, and the game itself.

A good game can be destroyed by bad implementation/port. And this is what we see nowadays with a lot of games. People refund N:A because they can't play it. I did refund a number of games because of the same issues N:A has and gave them negative reviews. When players are pointing at the issues, things change. When players do nothing, things continue to deteriorate.

Good game, very bad port, no one cares fixing the issues, review changed to negative.

(BTW, Virtuos is listed as one of the developers and that company is known for making bad PC ports - Horizon Zero Dawn is one example, so I wonder if they're the culprit here too...)",1539578672,1703849240,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is by far my favorite story in any game, and potentially in any medium whatsoever (though I haven't yet read some books that may surpass it). Beyond anything about the details of the plot, the story explores on a higher level philosophical questions about humanity, identity, mortality, and more. The game equips the player with an understanding of these things, so that as it progresses, the player may make informed decisions.

Playing this game with a controller is highly recommended, as the game decides to be twinstick shooter, side scroller, top down, and open world at the same time. In addition, the normal bindings on keyboard are strange to say the least. 
The game definetly shows its age in the lack of combat depth. Upgrades for the most part dont really do much and arent really important, and as well as this the actual combat is a basic hack and slash beat-em-up, but it isn't exactly the most engaging. The hacking minigames are by far more interesting and used in a better way in the story in general. 
Speaking of story, the story to this game is a highlight. After the first ending,The 2nd through the 5th do a much better job of asking questions and making you feel for the characters. My one complaint is I wish the second playthrough had more variety, as the first half feels exactly the same, except more hacking minigames.

Directed by the visionary Yoko Taro and developed by PlatinumGames, this game transcends traditional boundaries, delivering an emotional and thought-provoking journey that lingers long after the credits roll.

The narrative unfolds in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity's remnants have sought refuge on the moon, leaving Earth to be ravaged by powerful machines. Players assume the role of 2B, an android warrior, and are accompanied by a charming companion, 9S. The story is a rollercoaster of emotions, exploring existential themes, the nature of consciousness, and the price of war. The multiple endings provide a depth that encourages replayability, offering new perspectives and revelations with each playthrough.

NieR:Automata's gameplay is a perfect marriage of action and RPG elements, with PlatinumGames' signature combat style taking center stage. The fluidity and variety of combat moves are exhilarating, making every encounter a spectacle. The game seamlessly transitions between different gameplay perspectives, including traditional third-person action, side-scrolling, and top-down shooting segments, keeping the experience fresh and engaging.

One of the game's most notable features is its soundtrack, composed by Keiichi Okabe. The music is nothing short of a masterpiece, perfectly complementing the narrative's emotional beats and enhancing the overall atmosphere. The haunting vocals and evocative melodies are integral to the game's emotional impact.

Visually, NieR:Automata is a feast for the eyes. The desolate landscapes of a post-apocalyptic Earth are juxtaposed with breathtaking moments of beauty. The character designs, especially the enigmatic machine lifeforms, are unique and memorable. The game's art direction is a testament to the creative vision behind this project.

Beyond its technical and artistic achievements, NieR:Automata succeeds in creating an emotional connection with players. It challenges conventional gaming norms and poses questions that linger in the mind long after completing the game. The melding of a gripping narrative, dynamic gameplay, and a haunting soundtrack elevates NieR:Automata to the status of a true masterpiece in the gaming world.

In conclusion, NieR:Automata is not just a game; it's an emotional and intellectual journey that pushes the boundaries of storytelling in the medium. Whether you're a fan of action games, RPGs, or thought-provoking narratives, NieR:Automata deserves a place in your gaming library.

If you own a game pad then it is absolutely worth playing despite the cons.

Pros:
- Combat is action packed and a ton of fun. There are a lot of weapons and skills to learn, but if you aren't into it you will also have fun with just the starter set which can get you all the way to the end.
- Innovative story telling. You get to play the same story from multiple angles with many unexpected turns.
- Deep philosophical story. Makes you think about love, emotions, purpose of life. Very well written.

Cons:
- Keyboard & Mouse controls are abysmal. Don't buy if you don't have a game pad. I wish they had thought of better way to PC port this part.
- Camera is bad. Even playing on a game pad often the camera just looks up from your feet making it difficult to see the battlefield.
- Prologue is unnecessarily hard. If you are playing for the first time it can take an hour to complete the prologue and if you die you have to start from scratch. Don't be discouraged, once you get past that it will get easier. It is worth it replaying the prologue until you make it!.",1703667140,1703667140,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With that said, if you're into the 30 hour story RPG, I recommend it, the action is on point, the animation is beautiful, and it never once felt too grindy for the main story beats, in fact I was actually a little over leveled by the time I finished it.

This game is not merely an experience; it's an emotional journey, a philosophical exploration, and a work of art that deserves every bit of praise.

Pros:

‚Ä¢ Philosophical Depth: Yoko Taro's narrative prowess shines through in NieR: Automata. The game seamlessly weaves a complex and philosophical storyline that delves into the nature of humanity, consciousness, and existentialism. Every twist and turn leaves players contemplating the profound themes long after the credits roll.

‚Ä¢ Emotional Resonance: The emotional impact of NieR: Automata is unparalleled. The characters are beautifully flawed, their struggles resonate on a deep level, and the game skillfully manipulates player emotions. From heart-wrenching moments to unexpected revelations, the emotional rollercoaster adds a layer of depth rarely achieved in gaming.

‚Ä¢ Innovative Gameplay: The fusion of various gameplay genres, including hack-and-slash combat, bullet hell sequences, and RPG elements, creates a dynamic and engaging experience. The game constantly keeps players on their toes, offering a refreshing departure from traditional conventions.

‚Ä¢ Aesthetic Brilliance: The game's hauntingly beautiful world is a visual marvel. The combination of atmospheric environments, stunning character design, and a haunting soundtrack composed by Keiichi Okabe creates an unforgettable atmosphere that enhances the overall experience.

‚Ä¢ Multiple Endings: The branching narrative with multiple endings adds replay value, encouraging players to revisit the world of NieR: Automata to uncover hidden truths and alternate perspectives. It's a testament to the game's commitment to storytelling and player agency.

Cons:

‚Ä¢ Some Repetitiveness: In certain sections, there's a degree of repetition, especially during subsequent playthroughs. However, the narrative revelations and changes in perspective often justify revisiting familiar scenarios.

In conclusion, NieR: Automata is a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming. Yoko Taro's creative genius, combined with a deeply philosophical narrative and innovative gameplay, elevates this title to a level of artistic excellence rarely seen. With utmost sincerity, NieR: Automata deserves a perfect 10/10, solidifying its place as one of the most profound and impactful games of its generation.",1703614448,1703614546,True,6,0,0.560000002384185791,0,True,False,False

Rant 1: The story that is lauded as good by so many, is only impressive to someone whose deepest philosophical thoughts are spoon fed to them by bad game or TV stories. It is not deep. The philosophy of this game is war is bad, humans did war, humans are bad. 

Rant 2: The insight of are you still you if you lose some of your experiences is expressed through out the game. The start of the game and the end of the game. Truthfully these are androids and machines, they aren't loosing much if their physical form dies and their consciousness is transferred into another body. The game literally opens with that concept, and it is handed off like, ""oh well let's carry on."" Which that is the way it ought to be given the characters. Towards the end it though it tries to give weight to the preservation of their forms they currently have because they might loose something valuable. Though the fast travel system counters even that, because you are surrendering your physical form to get your consciousnesses put into another android body. The contradictions about personage and spirituality throughout the game frustrates me.

Rant 3: The auto-saves, quicksaves, and saves aren't consistent. The game tries very had to warn you that it doesn't autosave, but in reality when it matters it does. When you fight a boss and die, you restart at that boss and have to collect your setup from your previous body. If you die out in the world, you respawn at one of the quick travel hubs and have to run back to where you died to retrieve your setup. Then there is just ""save"" which I'm not quite sure how is different from quick save. Maybe I don't understand the distinction, or lack of it, because I beat this laughably easy game in 2 or 3 sessions.

Rant 4: The personalities of the characters is awful. You have 2B who is a ""srs bznss"" type that becomes slightly softer towards the end, but only slightly. 9S is an awkward kid who is trying too hard to befriend 2B. Then there is the operator that talks to 2B like she is a friend, but one that she has to help. The there is the main villians, which are JUST SO BAD. Design wise, it was like SE was like, ""What's better than Sephiroth? Two Sephiroths!!!1!!11!!!!""

Rant 5: The characters are all making human-like expressions. You kill a boss and he is like, ""so this is death.... it's so cold and dark"" The dude is a machine made android who is like a couple days old. He doesn't know what the cold is. He doesn't know what the dark is... not like a human ever would. Yet they ham-fisted those words out of an android's mouth. It is just terrible writing. There are plenty of other examples just about as bad as that, but it was the one I found the most offensive.

Rant 6: PC port is awful. Now, I'm not having the random crashes that I've read other negative reviewers give. Heck, I'm even running it on Linux and not getting crashes. What makes it an awful PC port primarily is the control scheme. If you keyboard and mouse, which if you are a PC gamer there is a 99% chance you use a keyboard and mouse, then you have to suffer through double-tapping to dodge and start a sprint. While that is slightly annoying, I'd say most of us can handle that. What makes that just the worst, is that due to keyboards not having a pressure sensitive controller like a joystick, we all do ""inching"". ""Inching"", if somehow you don't know what it is, and apparently the game devs who ported this over to PC don't, is just tapping forward in short quick strokes to move in the direction without going full speed at just pressing and holding. We all do it, if you play on a keyboard you develop the skill almost instinctively. You know what trying to inch on a keyboard ends up being? A double-tap that activates dodge, causing you to instead travel a long distance rather than a incremental distance. To get past a section of the game where I was trying to inch forward on KB, I finally gave up on with KB and switched to controller. It took me 3 tries with KB, and one shot it with a controller... so I guess I'm glad I have a controller. Why does my controller with only 18 buttons, have more functionality than my KB & mouse in a game? Now on my KB I can reach ~ - 6, tab - y, caps - h, shift - b, and cntrl - space for a total of 31 keys, 21 keys if you don't count mod keys, movement keys, and caps. Under my mouse I have 20 keys, 18 if you don't count left and right click. Then as PC gamers we can get extra fancy keyboards, extra keyboards, and other accessories such as foot pedals. So why with so many potential buttons do I not have the option to separately keybind dodge from double-tapping movement? Did a clown write the HID stack for this game?

Rant 7: This game looks lazy artistically. Most of the areas only have a couple of colors. Geometry is simple and textures are simple. I just played through Dark Souls and though it was release 6 years earlier, it was more visually impressive. I could have given art a pass for this game if it was made in the 2000's, but the teens!? The late teens!? The art is just uninspired.

Rant 8: The camera is just awful. We've all played games with awful cameras, nearly every game has one. We all just kinda get used to it and have keybound manual camera control somehow. This game makes it worse though, by taking complete control away at times. Suddenly you find yourself in a forced top-down view, or side-scrolling view. You can barely see your character sometimes for all the sprites and HUD elements in the way. I don't know, they tried something a bit different and I didn't like it.

I didn't like this game. I powered through it, hoping it would get better, I trusted that I had to be missing something with how many love it. I got through one of the endings, and that is all I have heart for doing. There are supposed to be multiple endings, but I don't have the heart to find one better. Trying to find the best ending is kinda like picking the best turd in the toilet... it is still just a turd. For me, the best ending is the one where I can say I did the game and have experienced and now the torture is over.

Rant 9: I am writing this rant after a couple of days of having beaten the game with the first playthrough. I say first, because I think it is obligatory to say first, though for me it is very probably also the last. When you beat the game the devs actually encourage you to play through again. Ugghhh..... that is such a lazy to way to extend game play time. They are obviously trying to encourage you see alternative endings. Then 2B also says at the end ""It always ends like this."" [spoiler] and then kills 9S [/spoiler], that's a spolier that you can see coming a million miles away. She is either prescient or experienced saying something like that. Given her stand-offish nature and at some point she says something like ""we are in a cycle of life and death"" I'm going to say it is experience. [spoiler] She has probably killed 9S, or some model like 9S, before. Given the names of the androids, the letter is the model of an android and the number is probably their sequential revision, or re-incarnation of that model. [/spoiler] Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... So 2B is stand-offish because she doesn't want to get attached to 9S, like Edward Cull;en from Twilight, and the lore of the game is basically The Matrix II. I guess I can't say this game isn't inspired, just that it is inspired by two of the worst stories made in the last couple decades. FFS is this what passes off as good?",1703443060,1703606844,False,5,2,0.48571428656578064,1,True,False,False

‚öñÔ∏è fMeter {A-} Worth a play, if you enjoy Robot Exterminator & Tryout New Endings. However, if you not gonna Trust the Unofficial patch, don't play it
[/quote]

[h1] üïò          IMPRESSION:[/h1]
* Year 2017: Game released 
* 2 hours later: Stop playtesting, because something is not right
* Year 2023: I trust the review, saying it is a Masterpiece that worth buying
* 2 hours later: Updated patch made great improvement from what I remember
* 8 hours later: Lost track in the quest and stopped playtest
* 20 hours later: Game is good, but not recommend for busy gamer.

[h1]  üîä         TESTER MUST KNOW:[/h1]

[h1]  ‚ö†Ô∏è        RUMOR CHECKING:[/h1]
* This game is truly a masterpiece. ‚ûú Not applicable to everyone, but everyone happy to hear it.
* This game changed my life, makes me play everyday non-stop ‚ûú Not applicable to everyone, but everyone exciting to hear it.
* I encourage you to look past the imperfections. Yes, it's worth it. ‚ûú Not applicable to everyone, but everyone love to hear it.
* Story make everyone laugh & cry ‚ûú Not sure about this, have to wait until I finish all the endings
* Silky smooth performance ‚ûú Not happen in 60 fps capped, unless tweak in FAR mod setting
* Pathetic PC port ‚ûú It was still happen until year 2020. Now, the latest FAR mod that has fixed many issues.
* Camera lock is very frustrating ‚ûú The solution is disable auto chip & reduce camera speed
* Ambiguous Quest? ‚ûú Not happen if player study to understand before continue playing
* Freeze in UI tutorial ‚ûú Happen if player idle for 10 min at the 1st time, and we must repeat wait for 10 min for 2nd time, or maybe 3rd time for 3rd endings, just because it is a masterpiece.

LODMOD
HD TEXTURES
SPECIAL K
4K Cinematic videos

Warning, I didn't realise this but Nier Replicant is the preceeds this.

I hate backtracking, there is a lot of it in this game but I was able to tolerate and somewhat enjoyed it. The gameplay is quite fun. You will find yourself going over the same areas again and again though.

Story is decent, though I couldn't help but think there would be some easy resolutions to the problems faced in the story. Characters didn't seem to adapt to some of the revelations in the game. 9s annoyed me somewhat as he just behaved like a teenage boy.

Combat is fun, collecting and upgrading is fun though I found I didn't use anything apart from the starter stuff as I didn't feel the need.
The game doesn't really explain anything about controls and functionality properly, there are some npcs you can talk to but it isn't great. Never figured out how to change 2bs costume haha...

Loved the unique progression, it was a very interesting take that I hadn't experienced before. This made it stand out significantly.

Some nice music in the game.

Overall looking forward to the next installment in the franchise, easily worth the ¬£18 I paid for this game.

edit: Forgot to mention, there are a lot of references to suicide in this game. I feel like the game should warn people of that as it could be triggering.",1703419923,1703442564,True,2,0,0.545036792755126953,0,True,False,False

There is an extended universe here stretching for who knows how many terrible games all the way back to the PS2- era from whence it all started, namely Drakengard. Drakengard 1 was an absolutely abominable and masochistic experience in all the ways possible. It took all of the worst design decisions possible for a game and made it the entire selling point, finishing off with an apocalyptic, End of Evangelion- esque storyline to really hammer the point home that you are not playing a game, you are slowly going insane. It was designed to be bad and soul destroying on purpose.

Nier Automata is a continuation of one of the endings of Drakengard where you are playing in the aftermath of the previous games, but to which there is seemingly no relation. What I find curious is that there are a lot of Drakengard and Nier games, which implies some sort of deep worldbuilding or story, but storywise they are all extremely cryptic and gameplay wise either outdated or plain clunky. The reason I have explained all this to you is that without this context, Nier Automata is just a curiosity with some strange design decisions and with a game director that likes wide hips on his women. If on the other hand you know the previous games and the grief one has had to go through with them, you start to understand that part of the appeal is due to the cult following behind it. I am sure Platinum Games did all they could to persuade game director and Sith Lord Yoko Taro to maybe make the game experience a little tighter and to trim the fat but for naught, which leads me to believe that the game was intentionally designed to have that little bit of needless frustration baked in to really give it that Drakengard ""flair.""

The core gameplay is quite enjoyable and reminiscent of Bayonetta, about as fast and fluid, but not nearly as deep. As I mentioned earlier, there is something not quite right with the game, because the game design is all over the place and constantly stops itself short. Sometimes you'll shift into a shoot-em-up section, sometimes the camera pans overhead to give you a birds eye view of the action, and later down the line you are expected to start hacking minigames in the heat of battle. All of these ideas are half-baked in a way where the difficulty comes from how badly they are designed. On easier difficulties, you'll be blasting through all of these sections wondering what is even the point, and on harder difficulties they crank up the damage so that every little mistake is punished with the force of a sledgehammer. If that wasn't enough, you can craft and equip upgrades with perhaps the worst system I have ever seen for such a thing. You can gain levels, although this too is something the game doesn't really use to it's full benefit.

Even stranger is how your hack-and-slash experience is also simultaneously a bullet hell game, since you are expected to dodge and weave through all manner of projectiles while on the ground. While it sounds like a cool concept, this too is very clunky if not unnecessary, because the core gameplay is not designed with such accuracy in mind, so instead, you are given a robot that can shoot these projectiles out of the air, but even this serves to add another layer of redundancy to the game because this aiming, beyond locking-on, is absolutely impossible. 

What you have here then is just a mish-mash of cool ideas that have no synergy with each other whatsoever. All of it is frustrating on some level. They are not ever thought out to the point where you could practice them as a skill. These ideas clash so badly with each other that it's a miracle they even got it all working. The arcade influence is obvious, but this is a game that is purely style over substance. The gameplay isn't unbearable, but is marred with all manner of useless fluff that is more of a hindrance than of a help. 

You have multiple endings, too, and there are 10 - 20 of them. Surely this is a sign then that this is first and foremost a story driven game, to which I say yes and no. Yes, because there is somewhat of a story however convoluted, shallow and obtuse, and no, because the majority of the endings are joke endings that bring you to a black screen that shortly describes what happened through text. Cue credits on fast-forward, and this is not just a figure of speech, this is what actually happens. That's right, they don't even bother giving you so much as a cutscene for most of them, and then laugh in your face for expecting anything else.

At this point you come to realize that this is a game that is making a show of taking itself seriously, but at the same time openly mocks you for trying to take it seriously. It makes you jump through all manner of hoops only to be rewarded with a slap in the face with a meta joke or a fourth-wall break. I feel as if I am being tricked into thinking there is a point to all of this, only to later find out that there really was no point. This is the true sign of a game that simply had no idea what in the hell it went out to achieve, but took you along for the ride anyway.

Now, with all this said, you would expect this to be a negative review. In a very meta sort of way, this is a game that is indeed deep, but which is exactly why it encourages you to enjoy it on a surface level. It is all one big inside joke, laughing at the player who tries to make any sense of it. I somehow feel this is a very cynical and satirical game, but why and aimed at what I'm not entirely sure. It is a flaming spiteful mess, it hates your guts and it hates itself, but it offers such a bizarre experience that for me, it somehow manages to redeem itself. If you were to patch up the game's flaws and strange decisions, it would actually be to it's detriment because it is such an integral part of it's identity.

Can I recommend it as a straight-laced action game? No. As a story-driven game? No. I think a post-modern commentary or art piece that goes to absurd lengths to prove a point is the best way to describe it.

Weird game with high notes but it's disappointing.
+ good music
+ atmosphere
+ No happy end
+ bosses (but there is only a few)
+ change camera from 3d to 2d
+ Good idea ,,playing with concepts''
+ story seems to be interesting at 1st...
But:
- story has of lot nonsenses, sometimes very boring, too much philosophy without points
- small open world: the same locations over and over, over and over, over and over...
- you have to finish game 3 times to beat it. 1 and 2 are the same with other character and the you unlock next story chapters (3rd playthrough)
- side quests: one of the most boring I've ever played. I was exhausted doing them
- backtracking are annoying, side quest and main missions in the same places over and over
- characters are woody without soul - not interesting
- gameplay is ok for Start but...attack and dodge. Nothing more. No combos. Smashing 2 buttons trough the game
- 26 endings (21 for jokes) - for what?
- annoying hacking system - too much.",1703177451,1703177960,False,2,1,0.44781145453453064,0,True,True,False

I finished this game on PS4 years ago. Since NieR can now be played on M1mac with GPTK(game porting toolkit), I decided to give it a try and bought it again on Steam. It's still my only and MOST favorite game ever so far in 2023.

I use M1(8gb) and it works fine, but it's not perfect compared to my experiences on PS4.
What I mean fine is the fps(24-30 i guess?) is a little low but still enjoyable. And again you must need a controller !
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I give a good review because I love this game (bulls**t i know :P). While I feel that the optimization on PS4 is better compared to this Steam version, but I give a good review because I genuinely love this game. It's the only game that makes my face wet, as I find myself shedding tears during the final ending without a hand to wipe them away. And it's not in a sad way; it's just because I feel loved. Love letters to everyone and    from everyone.

Little spoiler ahead (PROCEED CAUTION):



This game delves into philosophies, you can tell it from many details. The characters did not say directly about this but you might slightly feel about it from the story and what characters said.

Yes it's about, "" What is the meaning of our existences? "", ""What is life?"" e.t.c.

2B: Everything that lives is designed to end. They are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. Is this a curse? Or a punishment? However, life is all about the struggle within this cycle. That is what 'we' believe.

9S - LOVE and truth
A2 - Revenge and hatred. And ""how beautiful this world is...""
Eve: My brother was everything to me... My life was contained in our moments.

If you got an ending A, the story is still far from begin. The story actual begin with after ending B.

1. It's a good game. Not great, but definitely good & quality. There are countless other games I enjoy playing more.
2. It's for modern-style anime fans, of which I am not.
This review is not for the fanboys, but for everyone else.

If you're a juvenile boy:
The allure of an anime girl as the main character is probably a big draw and you probably don't mind the absolutely cringe-ful soliloquy of villians' dialogs. You probably have the spare time to play through the game 3 full times, as advised. And you may not have been exposed to much sci-fi literature/media yet and think that the story elements here are unique.

For the rest of us:
There's plenty of good in the game actually!
Character movement feels great; with options like double-jump, dash, and your floating robot pod to grab onto to slow your long falls.
Combat is fun button mashing with nothing being too complicated, suiting an action movie/game look.
Music is excellent, as are the graphics & scenes. The minor pop-in of assets and the desaturated color aesthetic may bother some.
Clever use of the system chips you slot in your android character for upgrades and base features -- all game HUD elements are default chips that you can choose to remove at any time (to free up a minor bit of space and/or see the effect... including death by removing an obviously necessary chip).
Camera changes and actual genre changes for some scenes keep gameplay fresh.  The camera becoming fixed to an axis & zoomed out gives you some standard 2-D side-scroller gameplay, and at other times you hop in a robotic flightsuit and take to the air in dedicated scenes playing basically a shoot 'em up. I dig those change-ups, and they're done well.
Story is interesting, good sci-fi tropes but nothing spectacular.
There are a number of little design things that all add up well; such as communications being a hologram pop-up on-screen projected from your character itself.

On the easiest difficulty with a few upgrade chips that give certain features, the game almost plays itself during combat. ;-)

From my research, it seems that fans demand you play this game through fully three times. The first 2 times are similar where you play a different character through the story the second time, but the third time is the ""real"" story or where it gets interesting.
I'll probably never experience that myself, I keep dropping the game and trying it again months later during just the first play through.",1703020493,1703021701,True,3,0,0.52348017692565918,0,True,False,False

 Nier: Automata is a combination of great graphics, fun and diverse gameplay, emotional storytelling, incredible music (seriously the OST is mind-blowing) and compelling characters. You might be driven away at first if you're not a fan of the anime-like visuals or revealing outfits (or at least that was my case), but you would be doing yourself a disservice if you were to ignore such a masterpiece based solely on a first impression.
 I wish I could wipe my memory to replay ending C and all the Pascal related quests (if you have played the game you will understand how this is an unfortunate choice of wording on my part but also agree with me). All of the runs are just so good and cohesive and entertaining and well though-out and meticulously planned I was amazed by every detail. And it's not just the main content that will impress you, but also the missable side quests and archives. Every weapon you collect, every enemy you kill, every robot or android you encounter, they all have a story; this just goes to show that the amount of time that went into this game is insane and I, for one, greatly appreciate that.

[spoiler]now i know i will look stupid for this but the fact that the game doesn't have an actual screen where it says ""ENDING: E"" is fucking AWFUL okay. like i was aware that there was an E ending but what i DIDN'T KNOW was that ending E was a goddamn cutscene that plays immediately after ending d. that absolutely ruined me. i saw it and i was like ""wow that is like a game over but i guess there's more???"" and I WENT THROUGH ALL OF ROUTE A AGAIN WITH NO ITEMS, NO SAVES, NO PRIOR WEAPONS, NONE OF MY OUTFITS, NOTHING waiting and waiting for route a to split and route e to start but THAT NEVER CAME OBVIOUSLY and i was just so mad when i found out that goddamn ending E was the cutscene right before i sat through all of route a again. i was pretty burnt out at this point and it pissed me off that i forced myself to sit through another 10 hours of gameplay only to be rewarded with nothing. i know it's my fault but i really think they should have properly told you that you had gotten the true ending.[/spoiler]

1) The fighting is fluent and smooth, Every Light weapon, Heavy, spears etc feel really good to use against enemies. 

2) The story is really good, Not much to say without saying too much but it's really good

3) The Enemies are really well thought out, being able to fight different variants of the same enemy is just something else. All though many games have this it is still fun to fight different machines of the same type.

4) 2B, what else is there to say it's 2B, I mean also 9S is there too.

Anyway the list could go on forever but it's better to let you find out for yourselves. But the game is really good and I say it's 100% worth the money.

It is not even possible to assign functions such as attacks or fire options to the mousekeys, so the mouse is pretty much just there to point the camera in the right direction. All attacks have to be assigned to keys. This made especially the top-down view parts really hard, but also the ""normal"" 3D parts were annoying, since one hand had to keep track of navigating, attacking, targeting and firing while the other was busy panning the camera to see the enemies.
This may very well be much easier and more intuitive when using a controller, but I wouldn't know, since I don't own one.
On top of that, the game informs you that there are no quick save, but there are supposed to be save options somewhere during the game. I played for around half an hour before I died first time, and I didn't come across a single save option during that time, so I had to start all over from the very beginning.

This game has its flaws: 
1) Unbalanced difficulty levels, the difference between Normal and High is astonishing, and it feels very strongly on the first chapter (introduction / demo).
2) The story from the 9S perspective is a bit more rushed than 2B's perspective, as if you start the Missile Supply mission, you basically will be stuck until to the start of the Route C, so any side quests that you forgot to complete, will be unavailable until you unlock the Chapter Select.
3) The lack of wardrobe... I mean common, I don't like to see 2B pants everytime I jump... (guess I didn't play this game for 2B at all), 9S and A2 are basically stuck with the replicant outfit from the DLC, which you need level 80+ to obtain from the ""tournaments"". 
4) Was better if they were more unique sidequests, not just collecting some material and looting...

Incredible story:
1) You have to play at least twice to understand completely the story, while is very complex as per design, sometimes it feels also linear (A & B -> C / [D -> E])
2) If you go to recordings and datasheets, there are pretty amazing details where it explains the main story (about project yorha and N2 - spoilers).
3) Because the humans went extinct, the androids and also the machines are having the existential problem (machines don't want to end the war, as the only goal is to kill the androids... / Project YoRHa founded by an android for the android based on a lie etc) + a nihilistic philosophy 
4) There is also good side mission stories which some of it may apply to the main story or not (e.g the missions with 60 and 21O / Emil quests).

Excellent graphics, good mechanics and excellent soundtracks:
1) For an rpg game, I can say the graphics are very good, a good example if you go to the Desert, and see how detailed are the particles etc.
2) Interesting game mechanics, you have various mini-games which occurs during hacking which I think is pretty unique at least from any average RPG.
3) The songs, just wow, it s incredible how unique and dedicated are based on a specified stage / or how the specified character / protagonist feels (e.g going into the Tower, 2B vs Adam - last round etc.) AND I LOVE THE 8 BIT VERSION OF THESE SONGS :D


In conclusion, this is a very good game, I dare to say it s a masterpiece, at least based on its story.

Not much enemy variety

Some of this game's best twists and turns are [spoiler] baked into the gameplay and structure of the game itself, specifically how the game ends, but then continues on in the form of multiple core endings and a full alphabet of other endings for the player to unlock. I am so happy that I, eventually, unlocked all of the endings and content, as there is a treasure trove of surprisingly core world-building tucked away in side quests, hidden archives, and random conversations with machines that would easily miss if you played the ""main"" story and stopped there. While it was a slog getting the last few percentage points of some of the achievements to fully 100% this game, even through the last hour of playtime I learned things about the story that I'm glad I know. For instance, there's a core character who you meet early on, Emil, who turns out to have a whole story of his own that you don't get to fully explore until you are very high level, after you've already beat the main story. There's also an entire interactive side-story from the perspective of a machine being trained to fight that only unlocks after you beat all three arenas, which is extremely difficult unless you are close to max level, again well after the main story is concluded. It is so engaging and sad, and worth the effort. This leads me to believe that the ""main"" story is, in fact, a story among many stories. [/spoiler]

To say that I loved this game is a gross understatement. This game was fun, totally unique, quirky, odd, and deeply philosophical, as well as being delightfully self-aware at the right moments. [spoiler] There are moments where the game pulls back and you, the player, are suddenly aware of yourself playing a game, and elements of the actual game itself become part of the game world [/spoiler]. It's also deeply moving at points. As you progress through the game, you notice that [spoiler] the machines that you are fighting at times seem more human than the androids you're piloting, and this entire game feels like a love letter to existentialism, played out on the stage of machines versus androids, but who is really pulling the strings in this proxy war, and what does it mean to be ""human"" anyway? [/spoiler]

Like I said, the best things about this game are heavy spoilers, but I also really enjoyed the world. It's bleak, it's relatively colorless, and there's ALOT of lore and machine life to explore.

There is one piece of advice I have to give to the people like me who generally play everything on the hardest setting. Don't with this one, at least not on your first one. You likely won't make it past the tutorial. There is such a massive imbalanced difficulty spike moving to the hardest two settings that most enemies will one-shot you from the get-go until you can build appropriately. 

In summary though, I'm so glad I took the time to fully complete this game, as difficult as that was to do without [spoiler] buying the Steam achievements with in-game currency, which is another quirk of this game that I don't think I've ever seen before [/spoiler]. Very much worth the time I have put into it over the last few years and really appreciate the work that the creator's put into making it as fun and thought-provoking as it was.

There are RPG, J-RPG, bullet hell aerial combat, 3D platforming/sidescrolling, top down and even retro style elements in the game. 
The camera transitions seamlessly to these various angles and playstyles keeping things fresh and intriguing. 

There is A LOT to do. There is always something to keep you busy, whether you are following the main quest or taking detours to complete side quests. 

While the story itself isnt the most amazing one i've come across, the game does have ways of making you feel invested in its protagonists. You either love them or hate them... Well honestly 9S is the only one you either love or hate. 2B and A2 are queens. 
Even some of the other less relevant characters like shop keepers and camp members have a story here and there and you can feel something for them as well. 

Pretty much every playthrough offered something new and surprising that I did not expect from the previous. 
And my god was that secret [spoiler]E-ending bullet hell credits sequence[/spoiler] amazing.

Soundtrack is AMAZING. Not to be glazing, but this has to be one of the best video game soundtracks of all time.

The bosses are very well designed and unless you are severely under-leveled (which is very difficult to accomplish unless you're just blatantly ignoring every side mission), then they aren't overwhelming. 
I would even suggest upping the difficulty level to make things a bit more challenging if you feel like it isn't enough for you. 

The graphics are pretty, nothing too amazing, but it is not too taxing on your system either.

Nier:Automata has left a mark on me unlike any other game I've played- from the music, to the story, and the compassion of the characters, Nier:Automata hooks you in and keeps you there. The combat is very fun and strategic, leveling and building your character is grindy, but not boring. The story is very lengthy, with 5 main endings to play through, a new shocking discovery through each route. With choose-your-own-path endings, you can experience all sides of the story and still have more questions to ask. The atmosphere is extremely developed, with the environment and music declaring the exact mood of the set and making you feel as if you're there. The graphics are stunning, especially for it's time. 2B, 9S, and A2 are all lovable characters who you learn about through their gameplay.

Once in a while, one encounters a game where the core genre it belongs to is difficult to make out. Well, [b][i]Nier Automata[/i][/b] is most definitely still a stylish action title, but is nonetheless a unique mix of solidly implemented tropes and mechanics from a variety of action video games.
[h3]I never quite realized how beautiful this world is.[/h3]
In actuality, however, it‚Äôs only a modestly good-looking title. The character models are well realized and animated, especially in gameplay, and the general art direction for the environments convey a strong sense of isolation. That being said, limitations are apparent without needing a thorough examination of the graphics.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2850372163 
Still, it shouldn‚Äôt really be an issue for a [i]Ryzen 9 3900X, 64GB RAM, 1070Ti, Windows 10 Pro[/i] system to run, even at 1440p and 60hz, right? Well‚Ä¶ not really. Without MSAA, 60fps are maintained usually, though some intense areas still dip into the 40s. Employing any multi-sampling to curb the nasty aliasing thoroughly tanks the frame rate to below 30. Beyond that, technical and stability issues are thankfully absent. Full keyboard rebinding is possible, and I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised to confirm gamepad rebinding too‚Ä¶ that being said, the former‚Äôs controls are spread out and cumbersome to the point that it‚Äôs a lot easier to just play on a gamepad.

On the audio front, the music is plain and simply beautiful. Simple enough in terms of dynamic layering, but epic orchestral arrangements are backed up with chill-inducing vocals, kicking in when the action ramps up (or alternatively turning into high quality chiptune occasionally)‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs sensational. Everything just clicks together in the sound department: weapon attacks and general sound effects are appropriate and satisfying. While I found the voice acting delivery overall excellent, be wary of the stereotypical ‚Äúanime gasp‚Äù that‚Äôs often thrown about by the characters in dialog.
[h3]Everything that lives is designed to end.[/h3]
In the very-distant future, androids and machine-lifeforms are locked into a forever war on Earth, with humanity having left it desolate for millennia. As part of YoRHa, an elite military force of androids, you play as combat model ‚Äú2B‚Äù - and are joined by your chipper and endearingly awkward, scanner-type sidekick ‚Äú9S‚Äù - to conduct reconnaissance and data-gathering on the curious behaviours of the adversary. An ever-destructive journey for the protagonists ensues, as they struggle to comprehend the bewildering nature of their enemies‚Ä¶ and slowly unravel multiple long-running conspiracies that shake their beliefs to the very core.

Story connoisseurs might quickly read through the lines and pick apart the plot twists and revelations long before they‚Äôre officially spelled out, while the philosophical questions raised seldom have much depth. Also, to get the full picture, you have to play through the whole story at least three times over, so strap yourself in. Past all that, the journey of the main characters is engrossing enough that I found myself significantly emotional by the end of each‚Äôs individual tale.

Also, there is no autosave. The game makes sure to remind you, because there is, indeed, no autosave. Did I mention there‚Äôs no autosave? If you forget, the 45-minute long prologue will remind you harshly...
[h3]We are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death.[/h3]
For most of the run-time, [b]Nier Automata[/b] is a hack-and-slash, with unique flair courtesy of the developers Platinum Games. Mix-and-match two weapons into your light or heavy attack slots, swap through your ranged pod‚Äôs basic and charged attacks, and string together simple yet satisfying combos against a variety of foes. On the normal difficulty level, evasion and offense are still emphasized, as you cannot afford to tank a lot of hits by default. To help with this, your dash/sprint function works as attack evasion if timed right, which you can then string into powerful riposte. 

Elements of bullet-hell are apparent from the beginning: adversaries fire large damaging orbs as projectiles, which can either be shot through with your floating pod or otherwise dispersed with melee attacks. Several hidden abilities are left for the player to discover, but as a whole your movement and combat kits are straightforward, if lacking in depth.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884849489 
With growing frequency over time, you engage in a hacking minigame that plays out like a more traditional twin-stick bullet hell shooter: you control a little ship and have a limited time to destroy a central node before you have to try again. I found these generally enjoyable, but the growing frequency made them a bit of a chore to go through by the end.

[h3]I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle‚Ä¶[/h3]
RPG elements are sprinkled throughout the experience. You level up through defeating enemies and completing quests. Both of these, as well as exploration, reward with minor crafting/trade items, or the odd weapon and equipment upgrades. Side quest design is lackluster ‚Äì the bulk of them function as fetch quests. Go here, kill some creeps or find some item, come back, sometimes do that again, and be rewarded. 

It‚Äôs the written dialog that primarily make these worthwhile‚Ä¶ that and getting something to make your damage numbers larger. Also, through these, you further get to explore a majority of the map‚Äôs varied biomes ‚Äì overgrown city ruins, urban areas turned into scorching wastelands, an amusement park kept alive by your enemies, and several more.

You can also fish in bodies of water.
[h3]‚Ä¶and wonder if we‚Äôll ever get the chance to kill him.[/h3]
One can break the difficulty into pieces through the plug-in chips system. The playable androids can have various improvements to combat, defense and movement slotted into memory ‚Äì at the same time, you can make more room for enhancements by taking away unnecessary HUD elements (but don‚Äôt touch the OS chip!... or do). Chips of the same level can be combined to provide a greater effect at the cost of more memory usage.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884834102
With the right setup, equivalent-level enemies and bosses will falter quickly. Level scaling is still present to ensure you don‚Äôt quite curb-stomp all opposition, and high-level enemies will demand your full attention to ensure not dying immediately, but - outside of a few optional gauntlets ‚Äì a skilled player wouldn‚Äôt have to die often. 

If you do die, it‚Äôll sting: you lose your equipped chips and have to recover your old body before it disappears or before you die again. Or, you can reload a previous save.
[h3]Become as gods![/h3]
Finishing the first story on the most critical path would require about ten hours of playtime. Subsequent stories are real emotional rollercoasters ‚Äì and take another combined 15-20 hours to complete. Thus, the proper finale is after the 30-hour mark. Side content can take a lot longer to explore, though be mindful of their repetitive and uninspired nature if the gameplay becomes boring. Hilariously, a bunch of endings are ‚Äúfake‚Äù and require the player to go against objectives or even common sense at certain moments ‚Äì rewarding you with a few lines of text on how you screwed up and adding to the completion tally. So, don‚Äôt eat that fish, no matter how tasty it is.
[h1]Glory‚Ä¶ to mankind.[/h1]
[i]Sure, combat is simple and the quests are boring ‚Äì but come for [b]Nier Automata‚Äôs[/b] otherwise satisfying gameplay, and stay for the emotional story. Difficult to talk about, yet easy to recommend.[/i]",1667679563,1701724564,True,47,1,0.781465232372283936,1,True,False,False

I went into this game with so few expectations after my first bad experience playing (I was playing on mouse and keyboard) but I can now safely say that this game is one of my all time favourites.
And I can say with 100% certainty after finishing the game 3 times over, doing all 26 endings, earning all the achievements (with the ones I cared about I did legit), and finishing every single side quest except for 2 (including dlc) that my only regret with this game was that I will never be able to experience it for the first time again.

Following a pair of androids, the player navigates through what most would call a stereotypical setting consisting of barren wastelands controlled by none other than rouge and mindless machines. But what makes this game different from any other game of the type? The brain of Yoko Taro, the game's creator.

Before NieR:Automata, the name Yoko Taro was almost unheard of and only known through his previous ""underwhelming"" game franchises such as Drakengard and NieR Gestalt. Although they have excellent stories and amazing soundtracks, Yoko's Drakengard and NieR were commonly known for their downright terrible gameplay and somewhat oversensitive themes. This all changed when NieR:Automata was released. NieR:Automata captures all that was fantastic about Yoko's previous works and combines it with newly imagined gameplay. Automata tears you apart by mixing well-known settings and engaging gameplay with Yoko Taro's specific storytelling through music and human weakness, leading to a combination of belief, trust, lies, and eventually nothing less than straight defeat, all while indiscriminately following the story of Drakengard and NieR and the long-lasting consequences of its characters.

If you're a fan of story-rich games, NieR:Automata and the newly released remake of the original NieR Gestalt/Replicant will provide everything and more, making every other fictional story look inferior in comparison.",1686975064,1701633575,True,1,0,0.51117318868637085,0,True,False,False

I'm a fan of androids and the future, especially futures that are set in a post apocalyptic setting like Nier Automata that gives the player a sense of lonelyness through the beauty of the environments such as the abandoned shells of buildings that were once inhabited by humans.

The game story mainly revolves around a couple of androids named ""2B"" and ""9S"" who are a part of an advanced human- made android division called YoRHa that is fighting an army of machine lifeforms.
The game seems pretty straight forward off the get go but, I assure you that there is SO much more to the story that meets the eye that strongly meets the criteria of a AAA title in my opinion.

There are a whole bunch of references to previous titles in the series, mainy Nier gestalt/replicant which is the same universe and path that Automata is set from. For a pretty well detailed and entertaining analysis to catch up on the series: (Mr clems Nier analysis) --- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnwEbOHo7Aw

The art direction is also very unique and interesting, everything from the clothing the characters wear to the weapons that they wield and everything around them is all very suiting and fits well.

The gameplay is pretty fluid with combos, dodging, parrying and far range attacks making you feel like an unstoppable android bent on the survival of humanity during battles as well as the movement around the world giving you unmistakable scenery changes to make sure that you know when a new area is entered regardless of how small the different areas are.

Upgrading weapons is a nice experience by giving a sort of cryptic back story to each one that unfolds with each level it reaches (min1-max4 depending on weapon) with a whole bunch to collect, some hidden pretty well.
upgrading materials are easy to come by for the better part but some are more rare than others in true RPG fashion that adds a grind element that isn't too taxing which is nice.

Upgrading your character is another story as it is done through items called ""plug in chips"" that are essentially boosts to your stats like running speed, damage buffs and recovery that can in themselves be upgraded into more efficient chips that can contribute to some really game-changing playstyles, coupled with some items that boost certain stats, to make you feel like even more of a badass.

There is a currency in the form of ""G"" possibly gold but I'm not sure, that can be aquired through the basic killing of enemies that gradually goes up depending on chapter and enemy type OR through hunting down boars and mooses for meat and fur. On top of those methods there is also FISHING that is pretty straight forward and not only gives you fish but also other area specific items depending on where you set up (City, sea etc). And last but not least sidequests for that all important material and currency that is much desired but the sidequests also flesh out the story of the game along with adding some carefully placed backstory that makes me suggest doing them as they come in to enrich yourself properly in the story of the characters and the world around you to gain a better idea of past events/lore.

This review ISN'T a REALLY IN DEPTH review because I think everyone should actually give the game a try and feel it for themselves. Yoko Taro and platinum games have really made this something special in my opinion despite platinums previous issues they really pulled through on this title which is why you might want to experience it first hand and not just look up a walkthrough. Buy it one day, on sale or not, don't just play through it once and be all like ""Meh, that's it?"" but actually continue the story (For reference there are 3 main endings with a few choices thrown in as well requiring 3 playthroughs each getting a little more wild and wonderful)

Also I started playing this game on a potato computer and it ran at a main 40fps solid and now on a more beefy machine a solid 60-100fps with each computer having completely different parts and brands including GPU so not too sure why everyones reviews are ""Wah game not work! Me too dumb to fix Grrr I bad review""
This review IS BASED ON THE ACTUAL GAME and not a sorry excuse of a computer or helpless user.

10/10 from Me personal GOTY 2017 and even more so in 2018 after actually completing the main story and secrets.
Recommend greatly to people looking for a fun and challenging game with some nice RPG elements and also people looking for a deep story to follow which may or may not break you emotionally if you pay attention.",1519248279,1701224685,True,4,0,0.545556247234344482,0,True,False,False

First of all, getting into Nier, you will notice that the soundtrack is mesmerizing thanks to Okabe, Ishihama, and Hoashi's collaboration. I think the music is probably one of the best that I have heard in recent years. The graphics are distinct and immersive in the open world, showing a desolate and serene environment, with contrasts to your home base. And the voice acting is also top notch, though there are nuances if you go through the English and Japanese dialogues.

Combat has some nice ideas for mechanics and story has some interesting ideas for themes - as well as potential for great characters - but nothing ever feels thought out and most of the time contradictory. Most notably: Machines and Androids are constantly described as emotionless, yet the japanese pathos cinematography makes everyone gasp in shock and awe throughout the entire game. Most egregious: the longer the game goes on, the more it tried to throw whatever deepities and pseudo-philosophical-word-salad at the wall - either to see what sticks, or because the writers didn't have concrete ideas either - while becoming an entirely incoherent mess The game did so, while pretending to add something substantive to my mind. I read someone else critiquing this piece of media as ""the writing of a teenager who just found their first look into philosophy"" - a quasi ""i am 14 and this is deep"" - The Game - and i sadly have to agree. Overall disappointment at the potential.

Is it a ""Bad Game""? Yesn't? I find it hard to pass a dichotomous judgement. But it's messy in almost all places and vastly overrated at ~90% positive reviews.

[b]First of all,[/b] I was very let down; the gameplay is really braindead, just hit the hit and dodge button, and ""have to hold down"" the R1 button to keep my pod shoot, that is all the gameplay had delivered to me. 

[b]The theme of the game[/b], I know it's supposed to have a depressing vibe and the emptiness of the world but the game is really flat, barren, and has lazy design ideas to me: the building that doesn't even have a desk or something human once used, or something that gives you a feeling that this place human used to live once, used to had a civilization once. It's just a stupid rectangular box, a copy-pasted. 

[b]The music:[/b] pascal's village and the ending song were really good, other than that just forgettable to me, especially the combat soundtrack.

Was the writing written by a robot as well? I could not find any real emotion expressed through the characters or maybe they are just robots? 

9S, I understood his feeling after the incident. He's right to do that, it's just that the way the game itself depicts 9S's anger or grief is just so blunt as well as EVE. after that point on the character 9S completely turned out into the one-dimensional, and I don't give a sh1t about the story anymore.

The plot is interesting but not for the storytelling, and the dialogue is not enough talking to convey the character's development to me, or maybe they just failed to deliver the main message to me. 

I wonder if this game didn't have Lolita fetish maid costume, booty fan service, or banal things such as sexualized characters. Imagine, a protagonist is just a man instead of 2B (e.g., the protagonist of Stranger of paradise). there still are people who would care about this game in the first place? prolly not...

2B's outfit: android wears high heels, the skimpy outfit in combat, and in that world? that's so obvious, it's just stupid fan service and successful to lure people.

Sorry, If I'm harsh, just hate the game that uses fan service as a tool to promote or sell their games. For me, this game is not that good in multiple things that's why I think this game just uses the fan service to sell the game. just like Atelier.

As it was praised to the heavens so much, I had very high hope for that, but it turns out really shallow to me. but I don't think the game deserves to get a thumbs-down. just average at best action and wannabe philosophical game.

Summary:

Offering a fresh blend of action and RPG gameplay styles, NieR: Automata is the follow-up to the 2010 cult hit NieR, and combines the design talents of Drakengard designer Yoko Taro in collaboration with development team PlatinumGames. The game tells the story of androids 2B, 9S and A2 and their battle to reclaim a machine-driven dystopia overrun by powerful weapons known as machine lifeforms.
Invaders from another world attack without warning, unleashing their secret weapon: the machines. In the face of this insurmountable threat, the human race is driven from the earth and takes refuge on the moon. The humans develop an army of android soldiers to fight back against the mechanical horde, but succeed only in slowing its advance. To break the deadlock, a new breed of android infantry is sent into the fray: the YoRHa squad. In the forsaken wasteland below, the war between the machines and the androids rages on. A war that is soon to unveil the long-forgotten truth of this world...

My opinion :

But what a game !!! From start to finish the game will have managed to make me stay without boredom. The synopsis of the story is very interesting and the different characters well exploited with a good background. The phases of actions, rest, sadness ... are very well managed with varying degrees of difficulty. The fights are beautiful and even grandiose I had the impresion to never do the same fight with the music just exceptional accompanying it's moments. I also enjoyed the moments of fighting in Flight Modules which reminded me much of the old game of the time ...The hack system is very good and funny without being complicated at some point . Unfortunately I find that there is too much use of the hack with 9s it is a pity but not disturbing . The game itself is very long and interesting I have 70 hours of game and I have just finished 100%, I have to start the game again from the beginning because of a certain end: D. For the blow ""you Will not get your money's worth ""and it's rare. One small defect is the optimization of crap that there is for each port console is very boring as always ...

2B : Female model android created by humans who fled to the Moon to avoid extinction by the Machines. The first playable character and protagonist of Branch A.

9S : Scanner type android who is best served when hacking, however he is still able to keep up with other close-range attackers. He has a very gentle and kind personality. The second playable character and protagonist of Branches B and D.

A2 : A prototype model that was used in order to create the superior 2B and 9S. She doesn't like to speak and often keeps to herself. The final playable character and protagonist of Branch C.

Pascal : In spite of being a Bio-machine, Pascal is a pacifist. She is highly intelligent and has an interest in the history of both humans and Bio-machine. (Fuck why Pascal I loved it very much)

It's dedicated to a once very dear special friend of mine. He introduced me to this game, and I often found myself falling in love with the experience because of him.

I'd like to share a short passage that you can take away from the game itself. The keyword here is to enjoy the beauties of life because nothing is permanent. Gratitude unlocks the abundance of life, making what we have enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos into order, and confusion into clarity. Gratitude gives meaning to our past, brings peace to today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.

So, in a nutshell, I dedicate this review to them.

The narrative unfolds in a future where Earth falls under the control of alien machines, pushing humanity to seek refuge on the Moon. Tasked with eradicating these metallic invaders, the YoRHa squad, a skilled unit of warrior androids, ventures to reclaim their homeland from the clutches of various factions with ulterior motives. In this tale, you step into the shoes of android 2B, accompanied by the newcomer 9S.

One might assume androids would be dull protagonists, yet in NieR: Automata, these robots are intricately crafted with poignant personal stories, surpassing many other characters in depth. What truly sets them apart is the evolution and revelation of their genuine personalities throughout the game. 2B, initially stoic and rude, unveils a more emotional side over time, while Nines, always playful and coquettish, exhibits moments of profound seriousness.

While the plot may seem straightforward initially, it swiftly takes a philosophical and existential turn, posing the ultimate question: what does it mean to be human? Upon completing the game for the first time, a pause for reflection is inevitable, as the narrative transcends expectations. The end is not a conclusion but rather a commencement to a deeper exploration of the profound themes embedded in the game.

Initially, it might appear that NieR: Automata's storyline would hit a dead-end, given its focus on Android protagonists and machine enemies. One might expect them to be devoid of intelligence, silently serving either humans or extraterrestrials. However, as you delve deeper, a realization dawns‚ÄîAndroids possess their own will, thoughts, and emotions, restrained only by the teachings and rules instilled by their creators.

While the theme of barriers between humans, machines, and androids has been explored in various works, NieR: Automata elevates this exploration to an extraordinary level, particularly through the character of 9S. Unlike 2B, who dutifully follows her masters' commands, 9S introduces a dynamic shift as the narrative progresses. It becomes evident that both machines and androids harbor secrets, and the days of humanity may be numbered.

Throughout the game, numerous questions surface, and the moral choices made influence which of the 26 possible endings you might encounter. NieR: Automata defies predictability, knows no bounds, and immersing yourself in its world proves to be an unforgettable experience.

The game world unfolds as an expansive open environment, allowing characters to freely explore scenarios while presenting enticing side missions and concealed areas. While the map isn't overwhelmingly vast, it cleverly capitalizes on the verticality of its buildings. In certain missions, revisiting previously explored points reveals them rejuvenated with fresh adversaries.

A notable feature is that specific secondary activities only unlock post the initial campaign completion‚Äîsome even requiring two endings‚Äîfueling the motivation to embark on the entire journey anew, particularly after an unexpected conclusion. Given its RPG nature, Automata boasts a comprehensive progression system, enabling the equipping of items and mods to enhance character attributes. The ambitious blend of hack-and-slash dynamics with the depth of RPGs proves successful, although the interface can be somewhat bewildering.

While the visual detailing in the sets may not reach the pinnacle, and technical limitations become apparent in fog-covered areas, the indisputable quality of the level design shines through. The game offers a commendable array of environments, ensuring a diverse and engaging exploration experience.

Bold, challenging, and featuring charismatic characters, NieR: Automata isn't just recommended; it's a must-play. Seamlessly merging the best of hack and slash with RPG elements, the game provides an addictive experience, despite minor pacing issues and a lack of complete originality. The robust combat and meticulously crafted open-world spark curiosity, enticing players to explore every possible ending.

This game offers a comprehensive package with refined, dynamic, and rewarding gameplay, coupled with cohesive and customizable systems. It caters to a broad range of players, ensuring accessibility for diverse gaming preferences. At its core, NieR: Automata delivers a captivating narrative that lingers in your thoughts long after you complete the game. Much like my experience, be prepared to emotionally invest in the characters' hardships throughout the plot.

Don't hesitate to give it a try; this isn't merely a game but an immersive experience. You won't regret diving into NieR: Automata and letting its unique narrative unfold.",1634060955,1700802551,True,14,1,0.659108340740203857,0,True,False,False

First impressions were mixed for me. The character design of our lead protagonist, kanata wielding, maid outfit wearing female combat android 2B, leaned into its anime roots with impressive conviction. Your mileage may vary, I was interested. The first hints of the plot were intriguing, and the frenetic combat system impresses with tight, reactive controls and a rich collection of scenarios and game modes. 

The color scheme, on the other hand, limits itself to muted colors and sparse textures, giving the entire game world a worn, washed-out feeling. The choice of having about an hour of tutorial without the opportunity of a save point seems weirdly cruel and antiquated, especially because that first hour has a really steep difficulty curve. Said tutorial also neglects to introduce any of the RPG elements in the game‚Äôs collection. So when I was finally let loose in its modestly dimensioned open world, I wasn‚Äôt quite sold on it. 

Things improve at a slow but steady rate, though. A growing stable of weapons and other upgrades bring variety and novelty into the combat. The spectacle fighter mechanics click somewhat with the bullet hell shooter elements that show up whenever one of the enemies has a gun.  The plot picks up and maintains steam on its way to some very weird and intriguing places. Side quests surprise with quirkiness and and often surprising depth. 

Questions remain, though: Why is almost every enemy a variation on the theme ‚Äúrusty beer can‚Äù? Why is our protagonist so cold towards her enchantingly naive sidekick? Why do I have the option to kill my protagonist by deinstalling her OS? 

On the gameplay side of things, it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt smooth sailing either: Over time, I settled on a combination of weapons and upgrades that broke the difficulty curve, and at that point, combat started becoming samey, except for the impressive boss fights. The dialogue seemed stilted and inelegant. The game kept its fast travel mechanics locked for a little too long and its ultimate gear upgrades were a little too grindy to obtain to bother with for me. 

And then the game ended with a moderately satisfying ending, dumped me into the main menu, winked at me and gesticulated towards the ‚ÄúNew Game‚Äù button. Which dumped me into the shoes of emo twink 9S, who had so far been the sidekick. 

And so I went through the whole story again, but with a lot more context this time. Also, there were instances in the first playthrough where 2B and 9S had split up, and the stuff 9S was up to during these times threw an entirely new light on things. Gameplay added a lot more bullet hell shooter elements, and the weird, impenetrable little plot kept growing and changing and turning into this epic greek tragedy, until a terrifying climax left me shaken, looking at the main menu and hitting the ‚ÄúNew Game‚Äù-Button again, impatient to what would be different this time. 

Everything, as it turned out: playthrough 3 hides the second part of the game. The plot keeps escalating and escalating, the existential dread is turned up to eleven. Time ceases to have any meaning. The fourth wall shudders and cracks. Several tens of hours filled with escalations and re-interpretations later, the game finds a suitably weird, thought-provoking and mind-blowing ending. 

And then, the god-damn end credits turn into a unique, sublime mind fuck of an EXPERIENCE I would on the pain of death not dare spoil, but which every gamer on this planet should experience.                                             Seriously, it‚Äôs that good.

And when I was done picking my chin up from the floor, something amazing happened: All the weirdness, all the inexplicably awkward design choices revealed themselves to be the outgrowths and consequences of a uniquely strong artistic vision. Seriously, I can practically see the contempt on Yoko Taro‚Äôs face while he blazes past every fork on the road that would increase player comfort but even slightly tarnish the coherence and integrity of his creation. I mean, I realize this was a work of a small army of creative talents, but they must have had a mind meld going on in that studio of theirs, because I, at least, really felt like I connected to a person through this one, a visionary artist with a few blind spots in map and UI design, and maybe a bit too much into waifish maids. 

The Credits. Man, those credits. 

TLDR: The story people have played this long ago, as every one of them should. The gameplay tribe should know that the offerings here are serviceable to good, but you‚Äôll get to be gobsmacked with the rest of us, and isn‚Äôt that kind of experience the reason we‚Äôre here, after all?

This game will make you feel sad, nostalgic, happy, and missing it when its over by the end. I'd say the soundtrack is the major culprit of this. The soundtrack of this game is masterfully crafted to get higher during intense moments, get more rompy and epic when you are exploring a lot, and get all nostalgic and sad when you are just chilling talking to people in quests. It knows how to really set the tone, and the story is gripping enough that it has a lot of emotional range to work with. 

Seriously every song has like 4 versions that play dynamically depending on where you are and what is happening and that contributes to an atmosphere this game has that is out of this world good. I believe the term for this is synethesia. Where all your senses combine to elevate an experience. This game is very good at that.

Like look, I'm sure if you're scrolling on by 90% of this game looks like an animu hack and slash with 2B, who everyone basically thinks of when they think of anime waifu. While I can't entirely deny that is the case, I'd say thats just the wrapping on the outside. Inside the game is a thorough deconstruction of ideas of humanity, philosophy, and what is right and wrong, and what it even means to exist and be alive.

Its also manages to have one of the most heartwarming for real endings in gaming history. I won't spoil it, but a lot of players will have sacrificed much of their time to get you to the true happy ending that couldn't be possible without them. You'll know why when you get there.

Thank you all for your sacrifice.

NieR:Automata is a hack and slash, like I mentioned before. But even though the story is awesome and the music is like getting an ear massage by the breath of angels doesn't mean that the gameplay is boring. Its actually pretty friggen great. Combat is tight and visceral. Slashing enemies feels good and even on replays I still found it very engaging. Parrying feels amazing and its not too difficult to get good at. Some enemies with massive health bars can be a drag to kill, but none of them are part of the main story and you can always ignore them and come back later to fight them when you are stronger. 

The leveling system also carries between characters so even if you stop playing as 2B for awhile and play as 9S or A2 you still get to keep your same level of strength, even if the playstyles are pretty different.

9S plays like a CIA secret spy agent and hacks everyone with a special minigame. He isn't very tough physically though so don't push him too hard or he'll fall over since the clumsy little dude legit gets knocked by like, every hit. His hacking is neat though. He even has a special quest dedicated to him hacking robots where you fight in an arena as one of the robots you hacked before.

I'll give you a hint. Use the T Rex robot. Win. Thats the hint. You don't need anything else. Stop standing around, I'm not gonna give you any more information.

A2 and 2B play a bit similar since they both use 2 weapons, except 2B is a tank that can take all the hits and has a pretty balanced moveset that uses combos and A2 is aggressive and has a moveset that mostly revolves around smacking things while screaming until they stop moving. She can also absolutely destroy her health in exchange for a massive power boost. I didn't use this much though because, while it is powerful, it can kill you if you aren't careful.

The game also features a Dark Souls style death system where if you die, you drop all your equipped chips and money right there. If you make it back to your body you can get your stuff back. Its as fun as it sounds.

Later on if you die its a bit more permanent. But I fortunately didn't have that issue much because by then you've gotten enough good gear and are practiced enough at the game that death is rare. At least it was for me anyways. I think I died maybe twice after that point but that was mostly because I goofed doing 9S's hacking minigame attack on an enemy while trying to eat pizza at the same time and then kind of stood there while an enemy robot kicked my face into smaller tinier pieces of face.

Overall if you're worried about difficulty and just want to see the story, or just want to watch 2B kill robots while you slowly eat cheetos out of a bowl, you can turn on auto mode by equipping the chips in your inventory. This will make her AI take over the hard part during combat so you can just kinda hit two buttons and without having to be bothered with things like paying attention or actually playing the game and instead spend your time ogling the protagonist.

You people know who you are.

Its also good for disabled people since the game allows you to customize exactly what is auto and what isn't. You could, for example, have the shooting be auto while you focused on slashing the bad guys. That way you still get to participate, but don't have to be super spot on with your reflexes to play the game.

Thats a nice feature for accessibility.

So who are your 3 protagonists?

2B is a quiet killer android girl that deep down just wants to be loved and hates her job. She kills robots and tries to save the earth but that of course is complicated by the fact that earth is already kinda screwed over by robots and the apocalypse and there isn't much she can do about it. She does what she can, and that is how she rationalizes the uphill battle she fights in.

9S is a happy go lucky curious android boy that deep down has a lot of pent of anger and fear and asks way too many questions that get him way too many unhappy answers. He and 2B are partners but hoo boy if they don't have a lot of issues to work out by the end of the game. He also kinda loves 2B. He kinda hates 2B. He also kinda wants to bang 2B. (I mean who doesn't tho) 

He's a complicated guy.

A2 is an angry android girl that deep down is an even angrier android girl. She is played by Cherami Leigh who usually plays happy ladies and it is odd to listen to her curse and gutterly yell at people but she does a good job at playing an impatient soldier girl that just wants to murder everyone who won't leave her alone to let her stare wistfully at the sunset while remembering all her dead comrades.

These have intersecting stories that connect over the course of the game and let you get to know each one in a different context. While 2B and 9S have a lot of the same campaign arc, they follow entirely different paths during most major beats of the game. For example 2B will have a boss fight in a dark factory with a shielded robot. 9S will hack the robot sometimes to shut off the shield so he can be destroyed. However AS 9S you actually have to hack the robot yourself while 2B fights it. So yeah, you are treading old ground. But its in an entirely new context which still keeps it interesting.

These 3 will become important to you by the time you finish this game. Even when they do dumb stuff, you can't help but like the guys. Like sure A2 is mean as heck to Pod who is legit only there to help her. But A2 is only a mad girl because life was mean to her. So you can't really ever fault her for her behavior. Its not like anybody was there to show her manners or how to cut her hair properly WITHOUT using a sword. Considering most of her friends are dead, I'd say her attitude makes sense tho.

All told this game is pretty fantastic and is a gem of a game. I'd go so far to say its one of the best games ever made. It has the laughs, the tears, and a soundtrack every youtuber seems to want to use as background music when they say sad stuff or ask for money.

Seriously, ya'll always play City Ruins in the background of your videos, but never the Amusement Park theme.

So I highly recommend this game. Yeah I know its got a bit of a price tag and hardly goes on sale. You'll thank me later though. Its a masterpiece.",1584753077,1700638218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) Soo little effort has been put in to make the PC port run well, all the controls are optimized for console and provide far too few options to adjust. The worst of which is, and i kid you not, if you move your mouse in a circle you start petting your pod/droid which causes you to stand dead still for 4 seconds even if you are mid combat. This has happened HUNDREDS of times already for me and caused very annoying deaths, and there is no way to turn it off. I also really dislike the dodge being a WASD double click and can't change that either.

2) The camera switches between 3D, top-down and side view. When this works well it can make platforming smoother but most of the time it just feels like the game is taking control away from you and makes it harder to look at what you want to.

3) Bullet-hell gameplay sucks. I'm here for the story and combat. To me these sections feel like a boring and unforgiving mini-game.

4) Tutorial is way too hard, long and contains no checkpoints. At the end there is a boss fight who has several insta-kill attacks that kick you back 30 minutes of grueling tutorial with unstoppable dialogue. And the strange thing is that it gets so much easier once the main game stars. The tutorial has literally the sharpest difficulty spike and least forgiving save system in the whole game for no reason.

5) Your sidekick loves pushing you off ledges and getting in front of people you want to talk to and chests you want to open, causing you to speak to him instead.

6) Melee combat is more fun, but the game heavily incentivizes you to just constantly run from the enemy while shooting backwards.

As I started out saying, I really want to like this game, the philosophical themes really resonate with me, the writing is clever and the world pretty. All in all I will probably finish the game for these reasons but for a AAA game that has been out for so long there are just a stupid amounts of annoyances.",1700615643,1700615643,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nier: Automata is like a fever dream that you never want to wake up from. It's a game where you play as a hot android who gets to slice and dice through a post-apocalyptic world filled with killer robots. And if that's not enough to get your motor running, then I don't know what is.  But here's the kicker - the game also has a talking robot head as one of its main characters. 

Yes, you read that right - a talking robot head. And not just any talking robot head, but one that has a sassy attitude and is always ready with a snarky remark.  If you're looking for a game that's equal parts action, drama, and absurdity, then Nier: Automata is the game for you. Just be prepared to have your mind blown and your expectations shattered. Oh, and also be prepared to talk to a talking robot head. Because that's just how this game rolls.

I Heard good things about the game around when it was released but didn't play it. 6 months ago I started to listen to the game soundtrack and fell in love with it. A month ago I started playing the game and recently finished it. Now when I listen to the soundtrack, it's hard not to cry. This game is a gut-wrenchingly sad but beautiful tale that has left me to spend a good deal of time putting the pieces together, contemplating what the intended message of the story actually is. It's by now means a perfect game, and many of the ""flaws"" are a matter of taste or  opinion, but if you enjoy the opening act, chances are you'll enjoy the entirety of the game. 

For me, the soundtrack alone would have made the game worth playing. I listen to a lot of music variety and the score from this game is very close to the top of anything I've heard.

 The movement and fighting mechanics feel very good but I think they are under-utilized. Given that the game has 4 difficulty levels, the majority of fighting mechanics feel superfluous and entirely unnecessary, though I only played the game on level 2 (normal). Mostly it comes down to whether you can evade/jump at the correct time to dodge attacks and how quickly you can button mash the same 3 basic attacks to hack through enemies. I enjoyed the fighting mechanics, but I don't see myself going back and repeating the game at a higher difficulty level. 

The side content is interesting and often tries to hide some deeper meaning within, but is mostly unnecessary to the overall game. That's the curse of open-world style games, I guess. Most side quests have some amusing/charming elements to them, but sometimes they just feel like a slog and weren't very well polished. It sort of feels like the director focused his attention on the main quest and let the interns work on the side-quests, only ensuring that the writing agreed with the overall plot of the game. In other words, they are hit-or-miss. 

The main factor that makes this game a massive hit is the plot and storytelling of the main quest line. It takes the ideas of many Western philosophers and presents them in a way that is emotional and entertaining. It tries to make you think about life. And death. And this is where you will either love or hate this game. I'm not even sure there is an in-between. The opening act should determine whether it's a game you'll enjoy. Obviously I loved it, and will be returning to play some of the director's other games...",1700529433,1700529433,True,35,1,0.770507693290710449,0,True,False,False

But between the unique bosses are a lot of running around, grinding, repetitive mobs, misleading maps, non-toggleable quest markers, not-very-useful fast travel that always seems to be disabled for the places you need to go, and invisible walls blocking you from travelling intuitive direct routes.

PlatinumGames' combat finesse, a seamless fusion of hack-and-slash and shoot-'em-up brilliance, turns every encounter into a visceral dance of blades and bullets. Keiichi Okabe's musical masterpiece acts as the emotional backbone, enhancing the narrative and propelling the gaming experience to unparalleled heights.

Yet, amidst the brilliance, there are occasional hiccups. The camera angles, usually a dance partner in the combat spectacle, can be a bit rebellious during intense sequences, occasionally disrupting the fluidity. The PC port, while serviceable, imposes a 60Hz cap, leaving high-refresh-rate monitor enthusiasts yearning for a more visually fluid experience.

However, Nier: Automata's allure goes beyond these technical quibbles. With only Ending A under my belt, the promise of multiple endings teases at unexplored narrative depths, beckoning players to return for more. The game's ability to seamlessly intertwine music and gameplay creates an unforgettable symphony that resonates, making Nier: Automata a must-experience for those who crave a unique and captivating adventure in the realm where the extraordinary meets the eccentric.",1700378784,1700378784,True,2,1,0.533695399761199951,0,True,False,False

The soundtrack is one of the best game soundtracks I have ever heard. You will not regret playing this game.

The experience is something I never will forget.

That said, the PC port is iffy. Some people have no problems, some people (like me) will get a constant 40 FPS and choppy experience on maxed out graphics or on the absolute lowest graphics, even with the community mods designed to fix that.

EDIT: After playing NieR: A., I can safely say that this is my favorite game of all time.

2B is hot. The game is not.

I solely believe that everyone that claims to love the game just love the character design and music, because that is the only strong point that Nier:Automata has to offer. 

Anything that is said about beautiful scenarios and atmosphere is overstimated. 

The scenarios present are as little as four that I will not spoil because god knows you will buy the game anyways if you are as far into the reviews to get into a negative one.

But keep in mind that while this games tries to be a hack-and-slash, a bullethell, an RPG and a story-rich adventure, it does all of those and also fails at all of those. 

It's a jack-of-all-trades and master of no one.

I'd be positive about it if it wasn't by the fact that the main hook is the story. 

And I kid you not, this game has the most foreshadowed, predictable plot twist I have ever seen. So much that I was left out feeling that there had to be another twist, something else because by the end of it I felt that it was telling me that the Earth was round and expecting me to feel astonished by that fact.

If you are coming here not for the positive reasons I listed above and are looking for a story rich original game..., keep looking. 

This one has nothing to offer but round butts and a funny twink. For most, that was enough to give this game a positive review.

Even on easy mode, some of these are near impossible. The turning point for me was a side quest called ""Family Squabbles"" - ridiculously difficult and made me uninstall the game.

The story isn't deeper just because NPCs have a theme of being named after famous philosophers. 

The narrative does have a couple of interesting twists & fourth-wall-breaks, but overall, I don't think it's as groundbreaking and earth-shatteringly good as some other reviews make it sound. Set your expectations accordingly.

The game's story is unusual and complex. This epic story about the struggle between humanity and artificial intelligence transforms the game from a mere entertainment tool into a thought-provoking work of art. The in-depth character development and plot twists draw players into a labyrinth of thought.

Graphically, NieR: Automata is a stunning visual feast. The game's world comes to life with exquisitely designed environments and detailed character models. Visual effects and the overall aesthetic of the game provide players with an unforgettable visual experience.

The music further enhances the atmosphere of the game. The music changes according to the various moments of the game, adding emotional depth. The fast-paced music during action scenes increases the excitement of the game, while the touching melodies and instruments during melancholic moments give players the opportunity to make an emotional connection.

Another remarkable feature of the game is its gameplay mechanics. A fast-paced combat system and a variety of weapon options provide players with an experience that suits a variety of play styles. These mechanics increase the replayability of the game and provide long-lasting enjoyment.

However, like any game, NieR: Automata may be subject to some criticism. Technical issues, poor performance and some bugs can negatively affect the gameplay experience. However, the overall experience of the game outweighs these technical issues.

The PC port had a lot of known issues when it was first released and when I originally started playing you had to download a MOD to fix the most basic issues (FAR). I was told the game has received multiple updates since that time that should fix the problems, but I still experience random crashes playing this game. I have zero stability issues with my PC and no issues with anything else crashing. Brand new clean install of Windows 10, Latest Nvidia drivers and the game still closes itself periodically. There are no error messages or any indication that anything is wrong with the game. I'm playing on a 12600K, 3060ti and gen4 nvme drive. The crashes happen at completely random points so sometimes I may get 20 minutes of playing in before the game closes and other times maybe i can play for an hour. Did I mention the game only lets you save and very specific areas and the autosave is very unforgiving? You will be replaying a lot of content, which brings me to the game itself. 



This game gets in the way of itself. I do not find the repeated playthrough method of story telling very enjoyable. When I first beat route A and popped into route B to start playing 90% of the exact game again, but this time as 9S I almost immediately lost interest in the game. The new content was sprinkled so few and far between and was things like, you may see one 20 second cutscene you didn't see on your first playthrough and then are back to the same quests, the same horrible to traverse map, (the map system in this game is also awful), killing the same enemies and following the same main quest. I stopped playing for over two years because of this, but since I do enjoy many aspects of this game I decided to give it another shot recently. After beating playthrough B, playthrough C starts with a huge difficulty spike. I was level 40 upon entering the C playthrough and the lowest enemies I was encountering were 45. Many of the enemies were all the way up to level 60 and could nearly one shot me. The game floods you with extremely annoying tactics to inflate difficulty like making you lose the ability to move your character, lose the ability to attack, lose the ability to jump, lose the ability to see (98% of your screen a massive red blob of pixels while you're fighting huge mobs of extremely over leveled enemies). Even with this I still pushed through, because I was determined to beat this game. I am now quite close to the end and still can't finish the game thanks to it randomly closing. There is a lot to like about this game, the world is interesting, the actual gameplay itself is fun and varied, the characters are likeable, etc, but so much gets in the way of just experiencing the story. Many herald it as one of the best games ever because of this, but I do not find this an enjoyable method of experiencing a game especially in this day in age where I have very limited time to play games and an endless backlog. 

````` 

Just to be fair I am updating my review. I tried to continue the game since I was desperate to finally finish this on my Garuda Linux install through Steam and it actually worked fine without crashing. Not sure what the deal is with the quirks I was having on my Windows install. The game overall is pretty great and I am happy I was able to see it through to the end and experience the ending. I would probably overall still recommend playing the Xbox version though so you don't have to deal with these potential crash issues. The game is definitely worth experiencing.

Nier: Automata is a game that defies all expectations and breaks new ground in the action RPG genre. It is a stunning example of what happens when a talented team comes together to create something unique and thought-provoking.

The game dives deep into complex themes of existence, consciousness, and the human condition. It blurs the line between androids and humans, forcing players to question what it means to be alive. The storytelling is incredible, with multiple perspectives and branching paths that keep you engaged and emotionally invested.

Visually, Nier: Automata is a treat for the eyes. The environments are beautifully designed, ranging from post-apocalyptic cityscapes to serene and mysterious landscapes. The attention to detail is astounding, creating a believable and immersive world.

What truly sets Nier: Automata apart is its combat. The fast-paced and fluid action is a joy to experience. From hacking enemy robots to engaging in intense boss battles, the combat never gets repetitive or boring. The game constantly keeps you on your toes, challenging you to master different playstyles and abilities.

The soundtrack deserves a special mention, as it perfectly complements the gameplay and enhances the emotions conveyed by the story. The haunting melodies and epic compositions stay with you long after you've put the game down.

Furthermore, the game provides a significant amount of replay value. Multiple playthroughs offer different perspectives and expand on the narrative, revealing hidden secrets and uncovering additional layers of the story.

One small drawback is the occasional technical hiccups and performance issues on the PC version, which can hinder the overall experience. However, the game's strengths far outweigh this minor inconvenience.

In conclusion, Nier: Automata is an absolute gem that pushes boundaries and challenges conventional storytelling. It is a masterclass in art direction, gameplay mechanics, and narrative depth. If you're a fan of thought-provoking stories and unique gameplay experiences, Nier: Automata is a must-play.

The heavily detailed open world, combined with somewhat fourth wall breaking gameplay mechanics makes for an extremely immersive experience
The combat system is surprisingly deep. The fast, fluid movement feels so satisfying to play. Hacking is also very fun!
The graphics are incredible and the music is god-tier
This game is so full of content, and there are secrets everywhere. Rather than putting out a half-baked, unfinished mess, PlatinumGames really put their heart and souls into making a completed game, and it definitely shows.

There are a few bad parts too:
Getting all achievements is a grind
Sometimes this game tries to be too immersive. For example, there are many long sections of the game where the pause menu is completely disabled, so you cannot save or load data. Meaning your only option is to hard reset the game, which will cause you to lose progress! This is just poor game design.
The ""Hard"" difficulty is unbalanced. I chose to play the game on this difficulty thinking it would make combat more interesting, but really all it does is make enemies hit 3x harder. So for anything but the weakest enemies, you're basically a one-shot kill.

Overall, the bad parts that I mentioned are extremely minor compared to all the good things about Nier: Automata. It's a well-rounded, complete game, and as someone who has never played a game like this before, I was constantly surprised with every new thing I saw. I highly recommend playing it!",1699344773,1699344773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My #1 favorite game of all time for so so many reasons. The characters, the writing, the themes and symbolism, literally everything. Even if I don't have the WHOLE nier timeline and story in grasp at the time of this review. I'm glad I was able to do something like this, although parts of it made me want to go fucking CRAZY and NUTS and EXPLODE!!! But getting to see (mostly) everything AND THEN finish it off with the credits scene made me really emotional. 

There will never be a game like this and if I had the opportunity to play it all again for the first time ever, I really would. Thank you so much Yoko Taro for making me question my life. I love you man. I hope you release another nier game and I WILL be sticking around for more.

It's a third person action-adventure RPG with bullet hell combat elements. Think Devil May Cry meets any of the dodge and shoot projectiles before they overwhelm you genre. 

Battles will go from your typical third person action combat to a top down camera where you must bullet hell, to then put you in a sidescroller style locked camera, to shifting you into a aircraft to do your typical bullet hell things, to then have that aircraft transform into a gundam to do the top down bullet hell again. 

It sounds like a lot, but it's so seemless, it teaches you fairly well and exposes you do different elements early. Progression is fantastic. Bosses are absolutely immersive. There's an open world element. That's not even touching on the actual plot or story for the world, which is equally interesting and very unique. Combat is tight and fun. A fair amount of customization options.

I waited way too long to play this. I've hit the 6hr mark, haven't even scratched the surface of the game and already see exactly why people hail this game as a masterpiece. It was crafted with love, with attention to detail, with depth that you'd only get from PS1-PS2 era JRPGs in which the world is shameless exactly what the creator wants it to be and a story to tell regardless of how niche it might be. It becomes very clear some of the commentary being made about various subjects early on. 

The only advice I give is that you have to work for your first chance to save. Make sure you're committed enough to get there. It's not incredibly difficult (I'm on normal difficulty), but I definitely got careless thinking  I'd probably respawn. Nope, start the game from the beginning.

The last ending you get is one of the most powerful emotional experiences in the game is worth the journey to get to. 

On the gameplay side of things, I really liked how the game plays with camera perspectives as well as the bullet hell sections of the game. The hack and slash part of the game is pretty good with some weapon and pod varieties but it felt a bit lacking in depth  alternative combos. There is also some customization that can be done with your equipment chips which felt fairly unique in that you can remove UI elements for some additional power.

Lastly, the soundtrack of Nier:Automata is one of the best among all the games I have played so far and really elevates the entire game to another level of quality. I really liked the Chaos language tracks of each location in the game. Some standout tracks I liked was the theme park theme and Weight of the world which plays at the end credits.

Combat is fluid and flows very well once a few plug in chips are installed. 

The game is effectively divided into 3 arcs: 2B, 9S, & 2A.   

9S's story can be tedious.  You play the same plot line again from 9S's PoV; unfortunately, this means about 1/2 the content is simply repeated.  However, the story beats unique to 9S are vital and very well done.

The third arc is all new content once you've experienced the first two arcs.

Been a while sense I finished this game; I've been meaning to write a positive review for it. The story was really good. (Beat the game on the normal difficulty) Don't be mistaken. Normal difficulty is just as hard as the hardest difficulty. It just doesn't reset your progress when you die that badly. The hardest difficulty has you replay the WHOLE chapter if you die. Not just up to the last save. The story reminded be of GFL quite a bit. Had this game in my library for a while but ended up playing it finally as the anime was airing. Ended up finishing the game before the anime finished because of covid... The anime ended up being quite different from the game. 

[spoiler]It took me 15 hours to unlock fast travel... Being able to replay any chapter of the story to get to the parts I haven't done was such a nice QOL thing. Which made going through all the endings well worth it. There is even a merchant that sales you the achievements once you're past a certain point of the game.

Story on surface level feels really simple but the more progress in the game the more you start to see cracks on this premise. What NieR:Automata does very well is asking you philosophical questions and come to conclusions about the actions you make in the course of the game. Overall, the story was stellar and once of a lifetime experience I would say.

10/10

[h2]Setting and Environments[/h2]

NieR has an post-apocalyoptic setting which has tinge of sad but haunting beauty behind it. While some areas can feel colorful and vibrant, some areas feel a bit empty and not as interesting as the other locations. [spoiler]Looking at you desert.[/spoiler] Eventhough this is an open-world game it didn't have to be an open-world. In my opinion linear world would fit this game more because sometimes world can feel really empty like you are just going from A location to B location without anything interesting happening.

7/10

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]

NieR might be a story heavy game but still shines in its combat thanks to PlatinumGames experience in this genre. Combat more revolves around weapons and chips(character upgrades basically) while different weapons offer you different playstyles while chips make you empower those builds or if you are struggling with the game help you in certain scenarios. Personally I'm not a fan of the Bullet Hell type of games and NieR has a lot of those still I throughly enjoyed it. Only criticism I can give is you have to finish the game 3 times to truly finish it. Second playthrough takes away a bit of your freedom and limits your playstyle. If you don't like the new mechanic it can be a bit dreading to play. Also eventhough second playthrough has an important part in the story it feels samey and gets boring real quick.

8/10

[h2]Graphics[/h2]

Although this game isn't groundbreaking on it's graphics I would say it looks still beautiful. And it shows you with it's environments and characters. Overall nothing gorgeous but nothing atrocious. [i]Also you can modify the graphics and models with mods to make it more beautiful[/i]

7/10

[h2]Music[/h2]

If have to summarize the NieR's music I would simply say 'hauntingly beautiful'. Keiichi Okabe's work on this game elevates most of the areas and boss fight and sometimes even taking the spotlight I would say. Making it an unforgettable experience. I still listen to it this and never get tired of it.

10/10

[h2]Overall[/h2]

NieR:Automata is a great game that I will not forget. It was an experience filled with happiness, anger and sadness. Especially the ending section. I would highly recommend.

9.5/10

[i]Personal Note: I never reviewed a game before but was compelled to it and felt like NieR had to be first. Because of this game's impact on me. So even if you don't like story heavy games I would still recommend you to try because few games can offer you this experience.[/i]",1698317314,1698317314,True,16,1,0.672364711761474609,0,True,False,False

I started out with NieR Gestalt on PS3/Xbox360. So when this game was announced I decided to play the demo prior to release and decided to get the full game, and after progressing past the demo and reaching the ""city"" I am sure any NieR fan knows exactly what I mean here and hearing the orchestra pick up slowly and then the vocals kick in... Well from that point on that the game was going to be nothing short of something special. To see this series come as far as it has from where it started back when I couldn't even count on hand people I knew who even knew what the series was or even cared for that matter. It's astonishing to see where it is now and if I was told by my future self then that NieR would go on to become as successful as it is now I would have never believed it, but alas here we are and with all that said if you're still one of the people who has not played NieR Automata or on the fence then you owe it to yourself to play this game as there is nothing quite like this unusual and expertly crafted world by Yoko Taro.",1679196015,1697875497,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The strongest part of this game is the story, which I will admit is cool and is probably the major reason I was able to complete all of the ""core"" endings. That being said, however, the story has its issues and like before, I can't understand why so many think it is comparable to the greatest literary works in our world. I'll even go so far to say that if you haven't played at least Replicant, half the story will have very little impact on you and you'll probably actually dislike it. I also believe that the story doesn't really pick up and get ""decent"" until the 3rd ending, and it doesn't get ""good"" until the last ending.

The combat has a lot of potential but it isn't realized that well. There are a bunch of weapons, different combos, pods, chips, and upgrades. This is all well and good, until you recognize that all of that is pointless because the enemies are bland and repetitive. They barely react when you hit them (if it wasn't a 1 shot), and increasing difficulty just makes the fight take longer because the enemies now have 5 times the health, with no new AI or movesets. Upping the difficulty also increases enemy damage to a ridiculous amount and until you have leveled up and gotten some good chips, everything will 1-2 shot you. The difficulty scaling in this game in general is weird to me. Easy is pretty much just watching cutscenes with some button mashing in-between when you have to fight something. Normal is still just watching cutscenes with some button mashing in-between when you have to fight something. Hard jumps into unfair territory where you either pay in the most boring way possible to stay alive, or you are dead.

Although I said the story is good, a lot of the characters involved are pretty bland. I know it was a design decision to make them like this, but it wasn't a good choice in my opinion. Many people will say there is a lot of character growth in this game, and I would like to disagree heavily. A great deal of the ""character development"" for Automata is established outside of this game in side material like the books/manga. The game itself hardly contains any of this context, so we are left with a lot of dry performances between characters that have no personality or chemistry.

Following tradition from Replicant/Gestalt, the side quests are absolutely tedious and horrible. If I wanted to do fetch quests I would play an MMO. There are some gems hidden in the heap of trash, but good lord was it not worth the trouble sifting to find them.

This all leads up to my biggest gripe with the game: rail shooter sections. I understand the desire this series has to change genres rapidly, but holy hell why are there rail shooter segments? Not only why are they there, WHY ARE THERE SO MANY OF THEM? Who likes these? I almost stopped playing every time one of these pop up, including right at the very beginning of the game.

TLDR and my major takeaway: When they are on sale, pick up Nier Replicant and Automata. Play through all of Replicant's endings (better game IMO), and then try to get to ending E in Automata. These are good games and while they have issues I think they are worth a playthrough if you snag them on sale.",1697864069,1697864123,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

NieR:Automata is my favorite game of all time. I'll admit it, I really love this game. It's been I think a year or maybe two since I first played it and my feelings have barely changed. 

The gameplay is very reminiscent of the character action game genre, albeit it is also an RPG. The open world is there, but it isn't really a selling point as there's very little to do in it. Level design is on point at basically all times, even when levels are reused on subsequent routes. It's not too long either, even if you plan on achieving all of the game's major endings. There are a few points in the game where it is a little too difficult or too easy, at least on normal mode, but it never overstays its welcome. The hard mode's balancing is ridiculous and I don't really find it rewarding to play whatsoever, even though normal mode can get a bit easy near the end of the game. Overall, 9/10 in gameplay, it could be better but not by much.

The story is... excellent. I'd rather not spoil anything, but its a game that you will think about for years after playing it and the story is the reason why. 5/5.

The art is good, even by modern standards for a game that's already 5 years old. In a few places it isn't ideal, and the character designs are... a bit much at times, but there's a reason why 2B is one of the most iconic characters in modern gaming. 4.5/5, it has already aged very well.

They came up with an entire new language for the music, completely unnecessary and just a massive flex, but I'll respect it. 5/5, fantastic, some highlights are the first route's final boss theme and the end credits, as well as the title menu. Weight of the World is one of my favorite songs just period, and even though I prefer the Japanese version, which I don't believe is present in the English release, it's still fantastic.

The game gets a total of 23.5/25, or 94%, which gives it an [b]S[/b]. This game is a must-buy, but at $40 USD it might be worth waiting for a sale.",1697845055,1697845125,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game: The characters no longer walk stiffly, but there are also some erotic elements. The plot has been complemented a lot, but the save file is still the same old routine. When setting up the battle chip, the game may crash, and the disgusting save mechanism will return your save file directly to the morning, wasting hours of gameplay. The map is also a problem. Sometimes there are no things in the area, but there are small red dots. There are too many air walls on the map, which may cause players to lose their way.
There is no particularly profound discussion in this generation's plot, at least I don't think there is as profound as the previous generation. I have always wanted to say that if you want to create a work that discusses human nature, especially in the robot genre, you must learn to program yourself and understand the difference between a program and a person. You can't just write a person and put a robot's shell on it to tell a morality that people praise.

I just really love the gameplay Í®ÑÔ∏é. The story really catches you and doesn't let you go.
This is an adventure game, with action and passion.

There are still a lot of mysteries to be solved. Questions with answers, that yet again turn into questions. ‚Çç À∂·µî ·µï ·µîÀ∂ ‚Çé
A lot of my friends recommend to finish all the endings and take time to explore and do all the side quests. Which I will do!
It can be a bit tricky sometimes and the bosses are very strong. Luckily I have 9S and the Pods at my side T^T ‚ô°
I can't wait to play again and enjoy the night away, playing as 2B in that god forsaken world.

Since I do not have those words, I will have to settle for calling it simply beautiful. You are immediately thrown into the thick of it from the moment you first start the game and never slow down until it‚Äôs over. Viewed through a literary and narrative lens, Automata‚Äôs storytelling is a masterwork example of the art. At no point does the narrative stray into nonsense or give the feeling of filler material, all while maintaining an ultra serious and dark tone with truly deep themes while never breaking the vital flow. As you play through the game you can clearly feel the story change and evolve in a way that feels believable and alive. The single negative point is that so much of that beauty feels somewhat rushed, leaving you feeling there should have been a bit more.

[b]CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: 8.5 (Superb) -[/b] If there is one aspect to creating JRPGs that Yoko Taro excels at more than others, it is character development. As with the main story, the main characters evolve and grow right in front of you in ways that make them seem to have a bit of real life. Each one is distinct in every way including the various individual challenges they face and the burdens they bear throughout the ever growing chaos around them. The voice acting is top tier with the actors clearly putting their hearts and souls into their parts. They also know how to convey and draw out emotions almost too well. The dialogue is superb and exceedingly well-written. I can't think of a single time it did not fit or add to any given scene nor an example of it being poorly presented. Even NPCs are treated with a level of depth and detail that make them feel like a living part of the game. As with the main story, the only negative I can find is the feeling that there should have been just a little bit more.

[b]MUSIC 10: (Perfect) -[/b] This soundtrack is another example of being a masterwork of the art. I personally feel that this is one of the single most amazing soundtracks in all of gaming and even across all of media. The attention to detail with regard to timing and adding an emotional level is stunning to say the least. Each track is distinct, of the highest quality, and fits any given environment or scenario to absolute perfection and offers such diversity and variety in styles that it never becomes boring to listen to even tracks that a player hears frequently while in-game. My one disappointment is that there is not more to listen to.

[b]VISUAL PRESENTATION: 9 (Magnificent) -[/b] Yoko Taro's unique and distinctive design work is part of what made him famous and maybe infamous. That style is on full display in Automata and to a level not seen in any of his other works to date. Where his vision truly shines is in his ability to portray that odd and sometimes disturbing style in a way that is still relatable to practically anyone. NieR:Automata is without question the best example yet of this so far. You can just sense that you are experiencing something special and remarkable as you move through the game. The cinematography is essentially perfect for cutscenes, capturing the action and emotion in a way that let‚Äôs you almost feel like you are there with the characters.

[b]GAMEPLAY: 9 (Magnificent) -[/b] The best description I have heard for NieR:Automata's gameplay is 'liquid smooth'. I tend to struggle with super fast and active combat systems so I was a little intimidated by Automata when I first started playing. To my delight, I quickly fell into it without any real need for a learning curve. The response time is incredible and the flow is flawless, even with as fast-paced as the combat system can get. The various functions are integrated seamlessly and are easy to grasp. The customization is quite extensive and feels rewarding, especially when expanding your arsenal. This is one of the finest combat and physics engines I have ever had the pleasure of playing within the genre I adore so dearly.

[b]CONENT: 9 (Magnificent) -[/b] There is a recurring theme with this game...it always seems to feel like there is never quite enough. This category is where I felt that sense the most. NieR:Automata is certainly a large game with a great deal to experience. The various zones are fairly expansive and are all seamlessly interconnected, making the world feel even larger. What makes it feel like there should be more is that it all goes by so fast that you are often left wanting more. I would say that this recurring theme is not so much a lack of content but more a testament to how easily the world, story, and characters hook you and draw you in.

[b]GRAPHICS*: 9 (Magnificent) -[/b] I feel that this category is NieR:Automata's weakest aspect. At the time of it‚Äôs release in 2017, the graphics weren‚Äôt top of the line or hardware extreme but they were certainly higher end. There were some odd persistent graphical problems and anomalies, mainly with regard to texturing and model detail. Even with the recent major update, many of those original small issues remain. While these can be noticeable, they are by no means immersion breaking. If you are willing to venture into the world of modding, every flaw in this category can be rectified.

[b]TOTAL (CORE): 9 (Magnificent)[/b]

[b]TOTAL (EXPANDED)*: 9 (Magnificent)[/b]


[b]FUN FACTOR: 9 (Magnificent) -[/b] I personally love and play JRPGs because stories are what I love for. The more detailed and immersive, the more emotional and moving the story and experience is the more I lose myself in them. However, JRPGs have traditionally not been known for being purely fun to just jump into for the gameplay (though modern entries are quickly changing that). Story and character depth aside, NieR:Automata is one of the most fun JRPGs I have ever played. This game is fun to just pick up and play for the sake of playing. I have a blast running around taking out enemies every time I load up the game and there is little more satisfying that wrecking wave after wave of machine lifeforms.

In my personal opinion, NieR:Automata is one of the finest and most unique JRPGs of all-time, a true gem of the genre. What flaws do exist are almost entirely drowned out by the overwhelming positives this game offers. If you are in the market for a deep and emotionally charged story, I highly recommend this game. You will have your emotions twisted and your existence questioned by the time the roller coaster comes to a stop to let you off.",1670036871,1697020617,True,1,0,0.500548839569091797,0,True,False,False

As someone who doesn't usually play JRPGs I must say it felt a bit weird at first but I gradually got the hang of it.
 
[NO SPOILERS]

Nier Automata is probably the most gripping game I have ever played. Everything felt so well crafted from its Incredibly beautiful and tragic story to its heavenly music, along with likeable characters and a beautiful world. The game also focuses on some though provoking topics like philosophy, existentialism, literature.

The game has 26 ""endings"" named from A-Z. The main story takes about 35 hr. to complete and takes you through endings A,B,C,D,E. All other endings are basically ""joke"" endings which are pretty easy to achieve (except ending Y). Reaching to ending Y takes a lot of grinding and took me nearly 80 hr. to achieve.

From a technical point of view, the game ran smoothly without any issues. It is probably better to use a controller but I played with mouse and keyboard and faced no issues.

Story: The story is actually really good, like specifically, when it comes to characters, you can really get attached to them, like say Pascal, the machine is a lovable character and just wants peace [spoiler]until the village gets attacked later in the story[/spoiler] and from what i've seen, the lore apparently way more deeper then I realized, not as much as say Destiny per say, but it's still deep, so I encourage you to check the lore in your spare time, it's complex as hell but interesting, oh, and let's not forget about how you progress the story, specifically, if you want to finish the game, you gotta beat it at least 3 times to get the full story, and how it does it, well, reminds me a lot of MGSV actually, because when you go through each playthrough, it feels like a free built in DLC that expands the story, where this game feels like it has something MGSV doesn't really have: Chapter segements.

Music: Beautiful and really good, It fits the world really well, and really dramatic, not much I can say here really, just loved the music because Weight of the World kinda made me cry after i finished playing

Gameplay: Loved it, It has the same feel as say DMC, oh and Pods are your best friend so try and use them when you can, and hell, even the sidequests themselves feel fun aswell, kinda shocking i know, but it's a first for everything, and when you die in game, the game will keep your corpse until you come back and collect it, which is pretty helpful despite this game not being a souls-like

World: Best way I can describe it is that it's like a Ghibli film but darker and philosophical then Grave of the Fireflies, but also very peaceful (if you ignore the killer machines), and just that when you walk around the world, you can't help but feel, well, kinda sad for some reason, at least, that's how it felt for me.

Final Thoughts: Nier Automata is a game that has managed to make me cry after playing the game, and I personally think that's saying something, I love the story, personal favorite, and IS in the same level as Death Stranding in my opinion, and has themes in it that remind me of Everything Everywhere all at Once, the final thoughts are short because i realize that most of what I wanted to say didn't need to be censored, Honestly, doing this i thought I had to censor most of the story segment, but I didn't need to and only censored one part of it, which is...actually, you just have to see it in game to see what I mean, so, in other words, keep on keeping on for the glory to mankind.",1695274498,1695274498,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-The Bad-
*Anything to do with the mini-game which is unlocked later in the game. It overstays its welcome by several magnitudes and becomes such a detriment that it actively sucks the fun out of the game. It breaks the flow of the game a lot. There is no way to alter the core gameplay through chips or weapons like everything else in the game. The first time will be the same as the last. What starts off as a novel and interesting idea for a game within a game, it is quickly shown to be shallow and repetitive. It's not bad. There is just way too much of it. You are warned. If you buy this game, by the time you know what this is it's too late.

*I had this game crash 4 times total. 3 of those were at the final ending for the main story. Coupled with my frustrations at the mini-game sections, it totally robbed me of the joy of seeing the proper ending. Great port, SE. Well done. I also ran into what is known as the ""white screen of death"". It is a white screen only but button inputs still seem to work. I mashed buttons and got out of it somehow but it's still noteworthy.

-The Good-
*This game has a really fun combat system with several weapons that pair together in different move-sets. You can have a variety of attacks to dispatch your foes. There are also many ways to customize your characters through various chips. [i]Edit: This has a very big and obvious caveat that ties into the first main ""bad"" point I made.[/i]

*There are many side quests that take you to all parts of the game's world.

*Most of the characters are likable.

*A very unique and interesting approach to story-telling and camera work.

*Incredible OST.

The game is fine. I loved some aspects and not others. A literal mixed bag for me. However, it's entirely serviceable but I'm not sure I'll be revisiting this any time in the near future.",1694990552,1695013166,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]NieR: Automata[/b] stands as a profoundly intellectually stimulating and emotionally immersive opus. The intricacy of its narrative is imbued with finesse, with each facet of its structurally delineated artistry showcasing uniquely exquisite conceptualizations. This aesthetic allure unfolds in multifarious layers, masterfully interwoven.

The underlying philosophy coursing through NieR: Automata delves into profound existential and nihilistic inquiries, offering an intriguing opportunity to illuminate the labyrinthine tapestry of meanings woven within its narrative and philosophical framework.

[b]""[/b][i]Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. Is this a curse? Or some kind of punishment? I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle, and wonder if we'll ever get the chance to kill him.[/i][b]""[/b]

Friedrich Nietzsche, the herald of the trenchant aphorism ""God is dead,"" expounded upon the metamorphosis of morality and beliefs in the modern epoch. Within Nietzschean philosophy, this aphorism signifies the gradual erosion of traditional religious convictions, giving rise to a metaphysical void. As contemporary society distances itself from theological conceptions wherein God is the fount of meaning and values, an existential abyss and tormented existence emerge. In Nietzsche's ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra,"" composed in 1883, the intricacy of the ""eternal return"" concept is meticulously explored. It posits that in an infinite and cyclical cosmos, every event, past, present, or future, inexorably repeats, bearing profound existential implications. The protagonist, Zarathustra, confronts the vision of eternal recurrence, initially overwhelmed by the weight of an existence perpetually echoing itself. Nevertheless, as the narrative unfolds, Zarathustra transcends this nihilistic perspective, embracing the notion as a challenge to live authentically and forge one's own purpose amidst the repetition of existence.

[b]""[/b][i]Everything that lives is designed to end. They are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. However, life is all about the struggle within this cycle. That is what 'we' believe.[/i][b]""[/b]

The contemplation of death lies at the heart of profound ontological inquiries within philosophical currents. Death, the most somber inevitability in human existence, bestows upon us the poignant capacity for reflection. The absurdity encapsulating death may not represent the initial definition of death proffered in Jean-Paul Sartre's 1943 magnum opus, ""Being and Nothingness,"" but it serves to underscore its logical primacy within Sartre's oeuvre. Sartre's conception of the absurdity of death embarks on a philosophical voyage, unfurling into a nuanced examination of the human condition confronted with its inexorable and inescapable terminus. For Sartre, death ascends to the zenith of absurdity because, despite our Herculean efforts to ascribe meaning to life, death remains the immutable event that terminates all our achievements and aspirations. It represents the ultimate and insurmountable divide that renders ephemeral our endeavors and struggles. Thus, the existential paradox is evident: despite our freedom to elect our values and purposes in life, death serves as an unyielding constraint, causing all semblance of meaning to dissipate in the face of finite existence. This dialectic between freedom and death begets profound anguish; even as we consciously select our actions and values, we are eternally confronted with the inevitability of ultimate annihilation. Hence, death, in Sartre's worldview, emerges as a pivotal element of human existence, not solely as life's conclusion but as an incessant reminder of the transitory nature of our endeavors. It stands as a mirror reflecting our ceaseless struggle to unearth meaning and purpose, even when confronted with the void of inherent significance.

[b]""[/b][i]A future is not given to you. It is something you must take for yourself.[/i][b]""[/b]

In the work ""Existentialism is a Humanism,"" penned by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1946, a cogent apologia for existentialism is enunciated, championing the primacy of human existence over essence. Sartre underscores that human beings are fundamentally endowed with freedom, thrust into the world devoid of preordained purpose, thereby bearing the responsibility to craft their own meaning and values. Existence, he contends, precedes essence, and within this radical liberty resides the agonizing, yet transformative potential for each individual to mold their own destiny and genuinely embrace their human condition. The cosmos' void endows us with a unique quest to construct our essence.

The musical tapestry of NieR: Automata unfurls as a sublime labyrinth of harmonies, resonating within the very core of the game, surpassing the boundaries of mere convention.

The painstakingly crafted score by Keiichi Okabe materializes as a symphony of emotions, akin to rivers of consciousness navigating the tumultuous waters of hope and desolation. Each musical composition stands as a sonorous poem, rich in subtleties and hues that beckon profound, uncharted contemplations. The vocals, often ethereal in nature, transport us to an ethereal realm of human expression where words falter, and melodies assume the role of tacit narrators, revealing the depths of the characters' souls. The interplay of diverse musical genres, from classical to electronic, forges a sonic mosaic that reverberates with the intricacies embodied in every facet of this masterpiece. This musical arrangement is more than a mere backdrop; it is the very protagonist of the narrative. The music does not merely accompany; it converses, divulging secrets, voicing anguish, and echoing the profound existential questions permeating the narrative. Of particular intrigue is the unique lexicon employed within these melodies. The ""Chaos Language,"" conceived by composer Keiichi Okabe, materializes as an abstract tongue, devoid of recognizable semantics or syntax. Instead, it comprises vocal sounds that conjure emotions yearning for expression. The incorporation of such an exquisite language into the vocal compositions within the score engenders a sense of both peculiarity and familiarity, echoing the theme of communication and comprehension among disparate beings, whether human, android, or machine. This concept finds eloquent expression through this medium.

This endeavor to elucidate select facets of artistic expression within a video game, albeit a modest one, scarcely captures the magnificence of this universe and its interpretation within the crucible of human cognition. Nonetheless, this endeavor remains rooted in the pursuit of expression. In the end, [b]do you think video games are silly little things?[/b]

The gameplay mechanics are refined, and satisfyingly stylish at all times. Director Yoko Taro is known for juggling nuanced narrative themes with bombastic set-pieces, and Automata is his crowning example.

The only downside to this release is the state of the PC port. The 60 fps cap would be tolerable if it were not also saddled with major frame-pacing issues and poor optimization. The artistic visuals are hampered by limitations like the low draw distance and 900p cutscenes. (This can all be mitigated easily by a mod from Special-K called FAR.

Thousands of years into the future, aliens have invaded Earth, using machine lifeforms as their army, forcing humanity to flee to the Moon.  Here, they regroup and counter-attack by creating the YoRHa, a military force of advanced androids with the mission of eliminating the invading force and reclaim Earth for humanity. In this virtually never ending conflict, the story follows 2B and 9S, a couple of YoRHa androids as they travel to Earth to complete missions and also learn about the world that is and was,, themselves as well about their supposed enemies. 

A little side-note: despite being related to the Drakengard series and Nier: Replicant, you don‚Äôt need to have played or know about these games before playing Automata. It could help you understand a bit more some details in the game but in general, Automata is like its own story, son don‚Äôt worry about that.


=== GAMEPLAY ===
The game is a mix of action-RPG with Open World. 
Combat is your standard hack and slash; light and heavy attacks, jump, run as well special attacks. Stats automatically upgrade as you level up.

Special attacks and weapons can be unlock/upgraded by completing mini-quests (collect certain amount and type of materials and money) or finding them during you gameplay (around certain area, quest reward, bought on store). There‚Äôs a ton of options/variants to choose from but most of them aren‚Äôt too distinctive one from another (especially when it comes to weapons) and in the end, you‚Äôll end up using just a few from all that bunch.
Combat in general is nice but it can get kinda repetitive after a while.
When it comes to the Open World part, the game offers a fairly decent map to explore around. You start in a main area that connects to the rest of the other areas, which you gain access as you progress in the game. Each of these areas have its own ‚Äútheme‚Äù sort of speak and does a good enough work to represent them, some more than others though.

The RPG element comes in the form of chips. These chips are divided according their function (attack, defense, support, etc.) and can help you create a build for your standard gameplay or for specific scenarios and even personalize your UI to some extent. You have ‚Äúmemory space‚Äù which you can fill with these with each one using an X amount of space, depending their level (you can upgrade them) and/or rarity. You can upgrade the memory space later in the game.


=== VISUALS & SOUND ===
I think this is some of the strong elements of this game.

On the visual side, you can see they put a lot of work on each aspect of the game: the characters (especially the characters), weapons, environments, menus, etc. It‚Äôs pretty cool to appreciate the details in each one. You can kinda have an idea of the character traits of each character when you look at it and their designs, same of the weapons (even the weapons have backstories so its look is not necessarily just because).

About the music, the OST does a great job on help you immerse in the game. The fights, the story, dialogues, even the side-quests, the OST has the right theme to go along with the ‚Äúcurrent mood‚Äù in the game. It hardly fails in this and I appreciate that <3. I haven‚Äôt heard the OST alone yet but I can bet it must be awesome to hear it while imagine the scenes in the game.     

  
=== FINAL THOUGHTS ===
Leaving aside the gameplay and visual/sound aspects for a moment, I think the core of this game are the characters and how the interact, learn, grow, get emotional, etc. and not just the protagonists; the support/side-characters, even most of the NPCs you‚Äôll probably know once are pretty interesting!  The gameplay is just a drive sort of speak to help you navigate in this broken world full of interesting characters waiting to be discovered. Interaction is the key word in this game and‚Ä¶is just a fascinating experience.
The gameplay is good, visuals and sounds are pretty good but the story and characters will stick to you from start to finish. I think this a game everyone should try, at least once.

The combat is satisfying.
The side quests are interesting and none of them felt like fillers.
There is no need for grinding.
There is a New Game + mode that is almost a must because it brings so much variety. One could even argue that the game really starts on your third play-through.
There is even an easy-mode in which not only are the enemies easier, but the game takes all the hassle away (auto-fire, auto-item, auto-build, and more) if you need it.

It uses the video game format to ask philosophical questions differently than a movie or book would be able to. But that doesn't change the fact that it should not take 2 playthroughs of the same route to get to the meat of this experience. I know it's silly sounding, but I could watch 10 films covering the same themes before I get to the point of this game. It reminds me of Neon Genesis's terrible communication of its themes which made my time watching the show feel like a waste. Also, Nier isn't saying much about ideas like nihilism or existence. It feels like an entry-level commentary on giant questions that can't be answered.

I can't believe such a beautiful and deep story can be made with androids/machines as your main characters. Excellent story, beautifully deep music tracks and such well-written characters. 

This game really makes you think about concepts such as nihilism, fate, etc.

Also, it might not be very clear, so please don't stop after finishing your 1st playthrough. This game has 5 main endings achieved through 3 playthroughs. And all of those playthroughs are completely different. The real story is gradually unfolded across these 3 playthroughs, so just stopping at the first playthrough will leave you with an incomplete game experience. 

Hope everyone has as much fun, and more, as I did playing this masterpiece.",1694160482,1694160482,True,23,0,0.710693657398223877,0,True,False,False

An incredibly emotional journey. Every single moment of this game is extremely captivating, with a complex story and surprisingly interesting characters that makes you crave for more. Yoko Taro's signature ""backwards scripting"" tempts you to tamper with every single aspect of the game, as the smallest of the details holds a depth and significance to the story. There are also a couple of jaw-dropping twists.

In terms of gameplay, the control of the characters and combat is very fluid, with a fast paced action with dodges and counters very reminiscent of another of Platinum Games' work: [i]Bayonetta[/i] (with a pinch of [i]Devil May Cry[/i]). Every attack strings together beautifully, with every single move being cancellable through the dash/dodge button, making combat a very reactive waltz of slashes and strikes.

The length of the game is also very long, easily surpassing 40 hours of gameplay, including sidequests (which probably take over half of those 40 hours). While the game has a lot of backtracking (especially until the game's ""fast travel"" is unlocked), it's not tiring as the beautiful landscapes and flowing movements of the characters are always a joy to watch.

The game has a customization system in the form of ""Chips"" that enhances the characters performance and can grant some game-breaking passive effects that can make even boss battles completely trivial. On the other hand, those bold enough to pick the Very Hard difficulty will find those Chips a godsend, as enemies one-hit kill the player in this mode.

Lastly, the atmosphere and soundtrack of the game are absolutely fantastic. I also recommend playing with the Japanese voice-over, as the original voices are top notch. The English cast is pretty solid, though.

Even if you never played the original NieR games or Drakengard, you will enjoy this masterpiece of a game that will make you actually reflect on ""What it means to be alive?""",1526363994,1694060869,True,19,0,0.678575456142425537,0,True,False,False

NieR:Automata is a game I respect because it's quite unique, but I must be honest. I enjoyed very little of the experience, save for the credits of the last ending, which is more for novelty than anything else. Story was a huge disappointment for me, which is an issue when it's the main selling point of the game. It's occasionally interesting, but lacks any real substance. For a game that's supposed to be deeply philosophical, most of the interesting topics aren't addressed much. The first playthough was actually pretty interesting story wise, but the second is not nearly different enough and the third is too edgy for my tastes. Combat is very brainless and is pretty disappointing considering other work Platinum has done. I had to really push through for the true ending, and while it's the best part of the game I don't think it was worth forcing myself through 20 hours of mind numbing gameplay.

One of the best stories in modern videogames

Unfortunately they're surrounded by hours and hours and hours of boring and predictable slog including replaying the entire first campaign with maybe 20 minutes of actual meaningful additional content just to get to the true final campaign which itself is only a few more hours of actual content. The hack and slash gameplay is solid but not complex or varied enough to stay interesting for the whole runtime, and the I'm 14 And This Is Deep plot doesn't make up for the just ok action. It's obvious within 10 minutes of starting the game that it's about ""What if robots became sentient, and what's the difference between AI and Human Intelligence?"" but the game has absolutely nothing interesting to say about these cliches because 20 hours into the game even though you regularly interact with an entire society of sentient robots the main characters still refuse to admit robots can be sentient, despite themselves being sentient ""androids"" which is totally a huge difference! The game's ""twist"" that Androids and Machines both have the same AI is comically transparent and unimpactful, and Bladerunner had more to say about the trope of an android questioning its own humanity 40 years ago in an hour and a half movie than Nier does in 45 hours of game plus tons and tons of shallow text logs. The weird and off-putting anime holdovers like the main character's cringe loli outfit make the shallow philosophy seem even more unserious, and add to the feeling that this game is mainly targeted at 17 year old weeb stoners",1693511514,1693511514,False,15,9,0.49690970778465271,0,True,False,False

It's not just some silly little game, it's a compelling narrative told in a distinctive style that fills in all the blanks as you get to know the characters and story. I never played a game by the creator, so everything was so odd in the beginning, but that obliviousness added unique touch of flavor that resonated with me at the end. The game's great storyline forces the player to consider their ideas and behavior. Teaches the player that there are various points of view and decisions that have implications rather than an objective truth or morality. Demonstrates to the user that life is not defined by a single aim or objective but rather by the experiences and connections made along the road. In a brutal and chaotic world, the game invites the user to discover their own purpose and value. There are many references to human culture, behavior, nature, and philosophies. The characters reference it either explicit or implicit from the perspective of not having lived in the modern human world, but in an post-apocalyptic world where our traditions seem absurd to them; reminding us to elicit gratitude of things we gotten used to. One of my favorite philosophical notions from the game¬†is that according to Jean-Paul Sarte, ""Existence precedes essences,"" meaning that a person's existence is shaped by their experiences and choices rather than being predetermined at birth. I believe in the universal scale, that everything is balanced in all aspects of reality, and that there is a certain amount of randomness that imparts some significance to our mere existence and suggests that our lives are not entirely predetermined. Our self-awareness gives the capacity for decision-making, which I like to refer to as constrained free will, allowing us to experience to degree of free-will. This is because experiencing is the ultimate objective of living things, which was likely foretold and deliberately carried out by higher sentient entities (god/gods) for what appears to be like an eternal of us. Holy cow i didn't mean to ramble on like this, i don't wanna go too deep into it;ANYWAYS! The game's outstanding visual and auditory experience¬†completely immerse the player in its world and feelings. Beautiful visuals, fluid fighting, and a variety of gameplay elements keep the player interested and entertained in this game. The game also includes a fantastic soundtrack that perfectly matches the atmosphere and tone of the game. The music in the game is dynamic and alters depending on the player's surroundings and position. It is a game that will make you laugh, a little horny[2booty], cry, think, and feel.

Then recently I agreed on doing a game swap with a friend (I play a game they want me to play and they play a game I want them to play). While I wasn't particularly looking forward to playing this again, I'm glad I did. The game is basically one big artistic vision. There are some things I don't like but overall the game is good if you're into that kind of thing.

First thing to note is that this game has several different routes/endings. The first 2 routes play in the same time period and essentially you have to play through those bits twice but with some differences in perspective. However, the whole main story is played in a linear fashion so you can't miss out on any main route or ending. Anyway, I'll start with the things I liked:


[u]Positives[/u]

-Graphics are decent for a 2017 game, nothing amazing but it looks good.

-Sound effects are great.

-Variety of ""plugin chips"" to customise your gameplay, though I kinda just kept one set on for combat: counter+, anti-chain damage, max hp and auto-heal and never died ever again and then I had another set for when you play as 9S for hacking+ stats and auto-heal.

-The story from route C onwards was a lot more interesting than route A and B, though I will go into that more in the negatives part. The overall story was a great experience though and while route A isn't as good as the others, the prologue does start the game off strong. Some small details in route B are pretty nice and definitely appreciated.

-The music is an interesting one. On route A I felt like the music varied from ""it's OK"" to good, but then from route B onwards they start playing several variations of the songs and damn they are really good. You can really feel the emotion in the music and it's amazing.

-Chapter Select from finishing route C/D allows you to go back and finish stuff you might have missed.

-Customisable settings for the standard gameplay camera. Really cool.


[u]Neutral[/u]

-I didn't really vibe much with the combat which was one of the reasons why I stopped playing in my initial attempt at playing years ago. The movement feels kinda ""floaty"" and I didn't really like experimenting with different weapons much because the beginner sword is fast and does decent enough damage anyway. Could just be a me thing.


[u]Negatives[/u]

-The Route A part of the game is mostly ""meh"". Although it gains more value after finishing the game, on your first playthrough it can feel rather... generic gameplay-wise. The map is absolutely terrible to navigate and look at before you unlock more of it from the teleport vending machines. Fortunately map and side quest progression is saved throughout route progression. The main story in route A is purposefully simple and because of that it's kind of confusing at that point while you're playing as people do rate the game's story as good. Another thing to note is that they play the credits after you finish this route... so some people might actually think the game ends there when it actually doesn't.

-Route B is mostly the same Route A but with a perspective change, additional cutscenes and the ability to actually be able to finish some side quests you literally cannot finish in Route A. I already grasped what the story was going to be about 3 hours into route A, I didn't need to spend another 9~ hours in Route B to have it shoved in my face more. I wish they kinda cut this route down a bit and spent more time on route C/D+.

-Side quests. Oh boy. Some of the side quests are interesting but most are basically just showing you the same repeated theme of the game even more and IMO felt like a waste of time (I do get that it's supposed to add to the setup though). I just stopped doing side quests after finishing Route B and started enjoying the game more.

-Dynamic Camera -- I get that the camera being dynamic and changes angles is an artistic idea and it's kinda cool from an art perspective... But in some cases for the gameplay it sucks so much to play with and is frustrating.

-Most of the world map is frustrating. The Abandoned Factory is extremely annoying to traverse for side quests but at least it looks cool. The main city area (outside of the hub) is badly designed where there are loads of edges that you have to perfectly time your double jump for to climb up. Also in the same city there are parts that feel pointlessly blocked off so it forces you to have to walk around the side. In the desert you are able to slide around, but it's annoying more often than not as it cancels your sprint momentum.",1693109544,1693109979,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If life doesn't have a clear purpose, why do so many people work hard every day?

Imagine a scenario where machines emerge with potentially hostile intentions. Initially, they just function based on their programming, without genuine thought. But if they evolved to think autonomously, are they equal to us? If they are equal to us, why must we fight? If we don't fight, are we the ones who will suffer?

Such contemplation can birth unease and apprehension. And from these feelings, fear emerges. But it is the fear of those that are different than us that may ultimately be our undoing, guiding us down a journey filled with cruelty and anguish.

Who truly has the authority to determine life and death? Even when we're gone, the world keeps going. If that's the case, is there a point to living? Is there a point to feeling fear? Is there a deeper purpose to human existence?

Perhaps our bonds and connections with others provide a semblance of purpose. Without these ties, what gives life or even fear its significance? Someone with many bonds has an abundance of reasons to cherish life, while someone without such ties might struggle to find an anchor to hold onto in this existence.

NieR: Automata is the [b] SEQUAL [/b] to NieR Replicant, taking place some years after the events of that game. This is an action based game, with some sprinkle of RPG elements, where you play as 2B/9S, in a future Earth where Earth has been invaded and been taken over by machines and aliens.

The game itself has multiple endings. As the game itself is meant to be story rich and story heavy, in order to really experience the full story of the game, it is recommended for the player to go through each of the ""Routes"" to experience the full potential of the story. 

[h1] The Pros [/h1]
Let me get the first two things before hand. NieR: Automata has one of the best video game OSTs I've heard in the last 20 years of gaming experience and the story, [b] especially [/b] if you know the context from NieR Replicant, is practically a gaming masterpiece. The story talks about strong themes about finding meaning in life, and the world building Yoko Taro has in the Nierverse is intriguing to say the least. The game does an excellent job in keeping you invested on what is going on, and there isn't really a moment in the game's story where you feel anything is being forced or unnatural. By the last credits in Ending E, you would really feel a giant hole in your heart, even more so if you have played NieR Replicant. Note: playing NieR Replicant is not required to understand the story for Automata (as you will be playing from the perspectives from characters that are not present in Replicant), but playing Replicant does add a lot of context that makes emotional scenes hit even harder.

For the most part, the combat itself is pretty enjoyable. The animations are fluid, and though the combat itself isn't that complex, it's pretty satisfying to say the lease. It's very satisfying to master your dodges in-game, while you bash machines with basic combos.

Gameplay note: Side quests in this game, unlike Nier Replicant, are completely optional and you can skip all of them if you would like. However, side quests in this game are a pretty decent way to also further experience the world building story portion for Automata. Overall, most of the side quests consists of fetch quests and combat with the occasional puzzle based ones.
  
[h1] The Cons [/h1]
NieR Automata is almost a perfect game, but the PC port has some issues to take note of. The primary issue are the occasional graphical hiccups and texture pop-ins that does sometimes distract the players. Textures itself on the PC, vary from decent to something that looks like it's from the PS1 era. I've only experienced 1 lock-up during my 40 hours of gameplay (had to do a hard game restart, but only lost about 5-10 minutes of playtime at the time). Aside from that, if you could get used to the graphical hiccups, the base graphics itself for a 2016/17 game looks not bad.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Personal ratings:
Gameplay: 9/10
-Simple but satisfying combat
Graphics: 8/10
-Graphics look aesthetically pleasing at times. Occasional graphical issues on the PC port.
Music: 10/10
-One of the most memorable OSTs in any video games out there
Story: 10/10
-Amazing story. Masterpiece if you have played Replicant.
UI: 8/10
-UI and GUI is serviceable. Mini-map can be cluttered if you take on too many sidequests at once.
Overall Experience: 10/10
-Post-anime depression is real

Also note: the English dubbing in this game is very good. It is recommended to play this game in English first (if you do not know Japanese), as many dialogue can be missed during the middle of combat.

It's not that I don't enjoy the battle side of things, its more that I can't tell where I am on the battlefield. The androids and robots you fight are pretty much the same colour as you are. The environmental effects don't help either. The battles against the first ball-spider goliath and Eve are good examples of this.

Replaying it for the first time since launch has brought back the rush of feelings that cemented this as my GOTY for 2017. The characters are well developed and incredibly likeable, the world is rich and full of secrets, and the beats and themes of the story really hit hard culminating in what is still one of my favourite endings in a video game.

If pushed for some drawbacks, I'd say the combat is far from Platinum's best and most of the bosses are pretty lackluster. Yoko Taro's habit of making you replay large portions of the game with minute story differences is something you'll either love or hate.

Not many games have the credentials to call themselves industry-changing, and it's not a necessity to do so. However, every now and then, one stands out with fresh takes on the medium, but only in some fields. Maybe it's the gameplay, art direction, or some cinematographic script that turns a game into a memorable experience. And yet, Yoko Taro brings us an example that shows us how boundless gaming can be as a medium for storytelling. From the get-go, one could say Nier: Automata is another Japanese action game with exaggerated character designs and a convoluted story, but as the player makes progress, it reveals itself as something far more engaging.

Gameplay is cinematic and makes use of a little robot companion with auto-lock to make it as flashy as possible, because just using your melee weapons alone won't give you the feeling of slashing through mobs of robots. Minigames that in other titles may feel bothersome or gimmicky are crafted so that the player never loses synergy in combat. Bullet hells are designed into enemy attacks, and sudden camera changes transform this game into many different genres in a matter of seconds. Role-playing elements with some inclusion of text adventure dynamics force the player to carefully consider the effects of some characters‚Äô fates. There was no chance Nier: Automata could combine all these traits, and more, into its core without turning into a product held together with duct tape, and yet its formula finds a perfect harmony among all these elements to evoke all its themes.

If you‚Äôre into philosophy, this will be right up your alley. The compact game world and quests convey a dark future where existence is constantly being debated by artificial lifeforms. Without spoiling anything, its main cast go through many different perspectives regarding the human condition of being by exploring multiple thinkers and their works. The player might not be aware of all this existential baggage, but the messages are embedded for easy appreciation and, eventually, further reflection. It also helps that the game‚Äôs ‚Äúroutes‚Äù examine different angles on how to search for a purpose in life. Combined with a majestic soundtrack composed with perfect understanding of tone during gameplay, memories will be engraved into the player‚Äôs mind for a long time.

Of course, there are some flaws, as there are in every game. The start of the game is quite slow, maybe even sluggish. The map doesn‚Äôt help that much in tracking side quests. The auto-lock is your best friend, but sometimes it will not focus on the bigger threats you want to tackle first. And yet, I can guarantee you will overlook the rough edges around this gem. Even when the pace starts to get dull, or the gameplay stale, Nier: Automata will throw something new to keep you engaged and, eventually, give you a reason to see it through. The reason behind this is that, even if the game depicts a sad and meaningless world, certain [E]nding will convince you that life, indeed, is worth fighting for and full of hope. 

I hope this title inspires further developers into being more disruptive, creative, and inspiring. This game had no right for being so good while being so experimental, as there are some titles‚Äô artistic visions that overwhelm their playability. And yet, Nier: Automata brought us one of the best experiences in gaming history. I hope everyone gets to enjoy it.",1692424837,1692424837,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fun gameplay (Hack n Slash with some bullet hell/shoot 'em up segments to keep things fresh), beautiful and very memorable soundtrack, and a really well written, emotional story that gets you thinking.

There are a couple of annoying things, such as the lack of checkpoints during the prologue. For this reason I highly recommend starting the game on Normal (or even Easy if you want) until you get to the first save point, then turn it up to your preferred difficulty if you feel so inclined. The mouse & keyboard controls are also not great, I would highly recommend playing with a controller if you want the best experience.

Anyway, if you're even a little bit curious, I would highly recommend giving this game a chance. It truly is something special.

My major complaint, which is why I am not recommending this game, is how cloud saves works: I had an issue once with my cloud save being wiped and had to restart my game. Goog thing I wasn't too far in my game. The other issue which is more irritating is that cloud saves carry screen settings between systems. This causes the graphics and screen size settings to change every time I switch between playing on my PC and my Steam Deck which have very different graphical settings. It is so annoying that this is something that was a choice by SquareEnix and/or PlatinumGames developers and even though in reality it is so small, it is annoying that they haven't fixed this already. I tried emailing their support to see if I could forward the issue and got this response:

""Thank you for contacting the Square Enix Support Center.

We understand you have concerns the display settings for NieR: Automata when changing platforms to play, and we'd love to help.

Updates in regards to the display settings being saved depending on the recent platform played is information that has not yet been announced and we are not able to comment at this time.

We do appreciate you bringing this to our attention, and rest assured that it will be forwarded to the appropriate party.

For now, you can stay up to date on our website (http://na.square-enix.com) for information on our products (both current and upcoming). We apologize we cannot assist further at this time.

Should you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us and we'll gladly assist further.

Take care and stay safe!""

Hopefully this does get forwarded to the right someone, but this has been an issue for so long that I doubt it will ever be dealt with, especially for such an old game. If you are planning to play this game on only one PC and have the specs or only have the Steam Deck, it's a great game. If you want the flexibility of how you can play, I honestly can't recommend this game. Maybe if this changes I can give it the recommendation I would love to give this game.",1692298107,1692298107,False,1,0,0.443548411130905151,0,True,False,False

An excellent merger of various video-game genres with seamless transitions, attention to detail, and near-limitless combat customization/movement techniques, all in a unique open-world map with an extraordinary soundtrack that words simply cannot describe.

For the most part, characters are extremely bland. I think majority of people actually praising this game are doing because they are horny for 2B and p much every other female android because it was critical to the story to make every single female character sexualized. 

Combat and camera are biggest offenders of this game tho. Weapons are painfully boring. Combat stays the same from start to finish. Enemies are sponges, literally. U won't feel impact of hitting them, and they sometimes take forever to kill. Combat is incredibely easy because you can just abuse perfect dodge constantly, and it's insanely easy to pull it off. Game loves to change between 3d and 2d ( 2.5d? ) and it SUCKS. Platforming is terrible. Your support character is stupid, and will constantly get in a way of you. O yeah, did I forget to tell you that your character will constantly trip on any rock/wire/bush? XD

OST is good for the first time you hear it, but entering/existing zones automatically switches to their OST with no fade, it's insant. AND IT ALWAYS STARTS FROM THE BEGINNING. Boss OST slap tho.

Game looks incredibely cheap, I get that they wanted apocalypse amotsphere but amount of reused and copy pasted assets is ridiculus for game of this ""quality"". A lot of invinsible walls. You see huge opening in building? Well no, you can't enter it. 

Saving system is atrocious but I didn't mind it that much because game was so incredibly easy, it was really hard to actually die after initial prologue. 

Animations of character look amazing, and I never got bored of them. 

Story.. where do I start. I won't spoil, but you need to finish 2 routes in order to get to ""good part"". Keep in mind that route A has huge amount of bad sections, and B literally expands on them and makes them worse. Side quests for the most part are garbage ( there were few good ones, but sadly very little ). You can't fast travel until like first half of route A. And guess what, in route B you can't fast travel either until certain point in the story. Keep in mind that entire game is based on: start quest on X spot, run to Y, return to X. That's it. That's literally it. It's just running, running, bland combat, and running back. 

2/10 because of pretty animations and serviceable OST.",1692020519,1692020519,False,11,5,0.488372445106506348,0,True,False,False

I don't want to spoil anything, and I'm sure there's heaps I don't know yet. The campaign is really well paced, balancing reflective moments with crazy action. Although there were a few times where I dived into side content, every time I focused on the main missions I didn't want to put the game down. When the credits rolled it felt like the story was over, but I have so many questions.
The combat is amazing, and 2B's animations are some of the most fluid I've ever seen. Some games have difficulty balancing flashy animations with responsive controls, but this may be the best implementation I've played.
All in all, can't wait to dive in further and see what the rest of the game offers.",1691932587,1692006250,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The great:
The music in this game is just absolutely fantastic. Great variety, awesome ambience, beautiful and evocatively charged emotive works throught - makes you want to just pause and admire.

Voice acting is absolutely stellar too. Every character, even machines you're meant to think are emotionless and soulless, deliver their lines with meaning and gravitas.

Combat variety is wonderful and enemy types are very diverse, each giving you different types of difficulties, optimal approaches and flexibility in how you may choose to approach them. Sure, you may choose to just hack-n-slash them all to bits - but there's no ""if you don't follow the dodge-dodge-x-dodge-jump-y-dodge-x-(...)""or whatever ""formula"" you lose without. Play to your strenghts and have your fun. This isn't a [with palpable derison] ""souls-like"" game...

The good:

Combat is reactive, varied, fast paced and wonderfully creative with multiple modes (odes to 2d side-scrollers, to 2d asteroids-like's, and more general 3d hack and slash and others) with an often wide range of tactics and strategy available to employ.
Controls can sometimes be a bit finnicky and unreactive (utilizing certain moves or attacks may often leave your character static longer than the animation would make it seem necessary, and your commands - dodge, attack, move - in that state would be ignored -- equally some ""hold to complete"" moves can be interrupted and without any indication you will be holding the button to no effect and need to repress - sometimes more than once - to continue) but for the most part, controls are very snappy and responsive.

The story is... Well, the story itself may be a bit of a tossup - a lot of it is built up on games you may have never played (the original NIeR released in 2010 I think, and maybe other media) -- but the delivery is engaging and fantastic. Lore is drip-fed in a way that causes enjoyable ""I want to know more"" effects, but lets you pace your way in.

Characters, for the most part, are very deep and get fleshed out progressively over playthroughs, letting you form bonds and actually care for and about them.

The not-so-great:
[minor SPOILERS]
I mentioned ""playthorughs"" so, yeah: This isn't a game you beat just once and move on. Or even just twice.
In fact, the first two playthroughs - the second of which offers expanded lore and cutscenes and different perspectives and dialogue on what you knew of from playthrough 1 (""A"") - are merely the prologue for the latter part of the game - which greatly expands the lore, the setting, and the emotional aspects of the game itself. There are technically 27 endings to the game, though only 5 really matter (and the 4th and 5th don't require a full replay).

I got 6 endings (the most important 5, and a ""joke"" ending by accident) in around 36 hours so it's not that bad and while you may be asked to replay some dumb intro-fetch-side-quests, mostly the game remembers what quests you finished in the last playthrough and will not repeat them or let you start over where you were.

The bad:
Combat can be a bit unforgiving early before you have access and use of ""plug-in chips"" which give you boosts to damage and defense, auto-use of recovery items when you're critcally wounded, and other boosts which will dramatically change your gameplay options.
The game doesn't do a very good job of explaining how to use them, how they work, or how you can upgrade them by combination and/or build your own multiple chip decks to switch by need and opportunity.
But once you get the hang of it and build a deck or two that suits you, it is night-to-day.

In conclusion:
This game was a sleeper hit when it was released, blowing everyone away by its depth and approach to storytelling.
And with good reason.

I loved almost every second of it and hold it in very high regard. It may not be for everyone, but I think almost everyone will get some degree of wonder and a cherishable and great experience with it if they last at least as long as ending B.",1691969258,1691969258,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game's character design is visually appealing and popular in cosplay and fan-art communities, and this is the content that sparks interest on social media. As a result, these characters have gained immense popularity among people who haven't actually played the game, leading to a superficial perception of the game, or worse still, complete ignorance of the games existence.

Some individuals may approach the game with expectations of finding more visual, sexual stimuli, while others might be discouraged by the vacuous references they've encountered online, assuming the game lacks substance.

However, once players delve into it, they will find a narrative and characters that are certainly not lacking in substance. It would be a disservice to spoil anything specific about the story, so I will leave my description vague. But I will say that the game blends exposition and implicit world-building and has an emphasis on thought provoking philosophical themes.

The music is exceptional. There is a running joke within the Nier community that these games are like buying a soundtrack with a game thrown in as an added bonus.

From a technical standpoint, while the games graphics may look a bit dated, with plenty of low resolution textures and few detailed models, but the art style is inspired and consistent. Many of the environments are able to be beautiful despite having a minimalistic design.

The gameplay is particularly interesting in the way it blends different genres. At first glance, the games appears to be a 3rd person action, brawler, but it cleverly incorporates elements of RPGs, shmups, bullet-hell, platforming, and more. Side quests, collecting weapons and upgrades, and a fishing mini-game further enrich the gameplay and replayability.

One aspect often overlooked is the game's general feeling of movement and combat. The developers specifically intended to create highly satisfying and enjoyable character movement, and they succeeded in this goal. Many other action games could learn from the techniques employed in this game.

Despite its widespread popularity, Nier: Automata is such an excellent game that it could arguably be considered underrated. Personally, I find it difficult to overstate just how exceptional this game is, ranking it among my favorite pieces of media ever.",1690045002,1691954008,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-The music is meh, i prefer nier replicant one, they're more emotional and makes you feel in the game. Im not saying that nier replicant songs aren't so good.

-The graphics are god, the game shows you all the details and shape to make the game more real.

-All the characters has their own story behind, even the enemies not only main characters.

-The fact that's open world wake it really fun to explore the entire map, is not small at all and if you are to lazy to make it on foot, you can ride animals or simply teleport from place to place.

-You have to know all about the story for enjoying this game fully, not only playing nier replicant but also drakengard.
Without knowing some parts of lore is going to be hard to understand the story.

My love for this game is so immense that I am able to get lost in it time and time again. My entire life I have always felt like an outsider. My interests are not what people would consider the norm. In that sense, this game is perfect for me, and has been perfect for me since I first played it in 2019. I'm not going to go into the specifics of the game in-depth, as this review is just going to be my love letter to this game.

NieR: Automata is what I consider one of the two most important stories I've experienced with the other being Umineko. The main messages that both stories share is love, and embracing the future. That sounds simplistic, but the ways in which the messages are portrayed have struck a cord with me that I don't think I'll ever forget. Reflecting on this game as I was playing it for this playthrough I've realized just how much of an impact this game has had on my worldview. Feeling alone all the time as a kid, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, and all I ever really did was escape from the world. However, this game showed me humanity. The good and the bad, the beautiful and the ugly. This game is just so... human. The true ending of this game was eye-opening and showed me that others do care. It's humanist message has taught me a lot, and my future is more full of hope and love because of it. The world is full of fighting, and all manner of horrible things, but I believe in humanity.

Funnily enough it took me around half a decade of picking this game up only to stop playing after 2-3 hours. Randomly, I decided that after 3 solid years of not playing, I would I try to replay this again. I felt that I'd changed enough as a person that I might enjoy this game more now. I guess I was right.

Nier is probably the culmination of Platinum Games. It might not be their best hack & slash but you can see how they used everything they learned in the past to make this game. Witch time, ""infinite"" combos, a slapping soundtrack and a very strong sense of self
I think the newest additions for Platinum are things like: 
1. Weapon variety is probably the strongest thing this game has. There's a move set for each category of weapon, but in those categories you have a TON of options. 
2. Plug in Chips. You can create a decent variety of builds and playstyles. I went for a lifesteal, full aggro build and it was totally viable. You can go full ranged or focus on defence, mobility, utility, raw damage, crits etc

But undoubtedly the strongest aspect of this game is how much it builds on the previous game ""Replicant"" while being its own thing entirely. I love the world this is set in. The atmosphere, the scale and the soundtrack come together and shit dude. When you think of an area, your mind just instantly puts that track on, and you start bopping with your head. It was the same in Replicant. I fell in love with this world and funnily enough you can see that through my use of ""Map mode"". It gradually went lower as i played because i remember all of the routes. 

They cleverly avoid pointless backtracking by giving you Fast Travel which is an insane QoL that I sorely would have wanted in Replicant. Side quests are defo worth doing in this game too. Some might be hit or miss but never egregious, while the ones that are good are damn good. 

[h1]Conclusion [/h1]

What a fun game. Simple as that really. Playing the different Routes was very fun, with the gameplay differences keeping things fresh. The story kept unraveling slowly and pulling you in. I feel that some parts of the story could have been sharpened up and some parts could have been trimmed to tidy up the playtime, but all in all, a good experience. The ending is the highlight of this. If you can pull through, I doubt you'll be disappointed. 

PS: A2 better ass than 2B. Fight me.

However, there are some issues. You slide a lot when you move, especially on sand, making picking up items from the ground irritating. There are also multiple parts where you have to walk extended distances while your character is injured, so you have to move very slowly. The first time I tried this part, I got punched behind some debris and got stuck for a while. Then I got punched down a hole I couldn‚Äôt escape from.

524220,143445282,76561198216839781,0,9,689,0,689,1691226818,"This game is HIGHLY overrated. I can't believe some people consider it to be a masterpiece. It's mediocre at best.

1) Not a single character in this game has any personality. They are ALL so dull and ininteresting and their motivations make very little to no sense. I could not care less what happen to any character in this game.

2) The story tries to be subtle and intellectual but it's actually boring and pretentious. Calling this a ""good story"" is like calling a banana duct-taped to a wall ""art"". And to the people who say ""You actually have to complete the game 3 times to have ending C to understand it and to make it good"" just GTFO. It's like saying ""You have to read all the Harry Potter books to make the first one good"", it's just bullshit. First playthrough should be good on itself.


3) The open world is not ugly but it's not pretty either. It feels really outdated, even considering the game is from 2017. Everything is low-poly with mediocre textures. The only location that look ""good"" is the circus/fair. The world doesn't make you want to explore it. 

4) The combat system feels nice at first, but once you realise that you can be nearly invincible if you spam the dodge button, the combats lose ALL interest. Combine it with the fact that you can buy 99 small heals + 99 medium heals + 99 big heals for a fairly cheap price and you won't EVEN need to dodge attack. And finally, the combos and fighting possibilities lack a lot of depth and you fight every enemies in the same way.

5) There are some questionnable game design decisions that make the game tedious. For example, the fact that retrieving your body triggers 3 pop-up windows. Or the fact that you have to reactivate some teleporter mid-game. Or the fact that 2B stumbles on pebbles and rubbles. And many other small things that make the game annoying.

6) The ""side quests"" are nothing more than UPS quests: Talk to a NPC, go pick up 3 metal bolt in a field or talk to another NPC in the middle of nowhere then come back for reward. Some quests are a little more ""interesting"" like ""kill this group of enemies in less than 30s"" or ""reach this destination on foot before the NPC"" but that's about it....

The good things about this game are : 
-2b, you can clearly see that the devs spend more time on her than on any other characters or assets in the game. She has good design and she's well detailed.
-The animation (combat, runing, etc) are GREAT. That's the reason why combat and movements are enjoyable at time, even though combat is button smashing.
-All the mech phases/shoot'em up are good
-The music and sound design is good, except for some dialogues that are not dumbed for some reasons.

The game is not trash, but it's really dull, lame and even annoying sometimes (regularly).
I 100% believe that without the ""waifu""/ ""sexelegant"" design of 2B, this game would have NEVER had that much attention and fanbase. People who worship this game have probably little to no cultural background to call that a masterpiece.

I was hesitant to play this game and expected to not enjoy it because of 2B butt meme and all that, but it's easily one of my all time favourite games. An amazing and beautiful game through and through.

[b]Good:[/b]
[list]
    [*] The soundtrack is amazing.
    [*] Captivating and emotional story.
    [*] I enjoy the world a lot.
    [*] Likeable cast of characters.
    [*] Character movement feels nice and fluid.
    [*] Interesting mix of different camera angles and gameplay elements for different areas of the game.
    [*] Plugin Chips (character enhancements) can be customized to suit your playstyle.
    [*] Side quests add to the experience rather than just being chores.
    [*] No difficulty based achievements.
    [*] Exploration is encouraged and rewarded.
    [*] Additional customization options within easier difficulty settings makes the game more accessible for people with disabilities.
    [*] Limited unofficial moddability, but it exists.
[/list] 

[b]Neutral:[/b]
[list]
    [*] Knowledge of previous installments adds to the experience, but is not required to enjoy the story.
    [*] Combat can be a bit button mashy.
    [*] The map and menu takes some getting used to.
    [*] 60 FPS lock. Unlockable, but speeds up certain elements so I don't recommend it.
    [*] Graphics look outdated for its time, but it doesn't make the game any less enjoyable.
    [*] Fan service in female character designs. Something to keep in mind if it's something you feel strongly about.
[/list] 

[b]Bad:[/b]
[list]
    [*] Without Movement Speed plugin chips, dashing is faster than running, incentivizing you to spam dash to move around.
    [*] I can't stop obsessing over it.
    [*] I hear the soundtrack playing in my head all day every day.
    [*] I even bought a body pillow.

[i]Spoiler free[/i]

[h2]Summary[/h2]
NieR: Automata uses every element of a video game (gameplay, storytelling, perspective and character building, music, the enviroment etc etc) woven together to create a story and convey emotions in a way that can only be done through the medium of a video game. 

When I saw the screenshots and trailers of the game I did not want to play it. But years later I'm glad I finally did. And like any piece of art it might not resonate with you, but if it does... 

...well here is one of the best games you will ever play.

[h2]The story[/h2]
Gameplay wise the game starts with a bang.
The story starts slow, but picks up and is a big part of why this game is a masterpiece.

(slight spoiler ahead about how you engage with the story not about it's contents) 
[spoiler]When you think you first finished the game, but have so many unanswered questions know that this is the whole point of the game. You go through the story again (and quicker, and different) through a different lens and start unpacking the story bit by bit. It caught me by surprise how much I liked this aspect as I'm not one to replay singleplayer games.[/spoiler]

You will not understand everything at first.
One tip I can give is to keep going forward and don't waste too much time on sidequests (at first) that you don't like or stuff you don't understand. Keep going forward 2B.

[h2]The soundtrack[/h2]
It's insanely good and I really mean 10 out of 10 good. It's not just that the songs are great and well composed. How the music fluently intertwines with where you are and what you're doing is something I have never seen before in a game. How does this work? Well: every track has multiple versions on top of that there are versions with and without vocals and if that wasn't enough most of them have an 8 bit retrofied version to fit a certain gameplay element.

[h2]The combat system[/h2]
The combat system is very simple at first glance but is actually deep and intricate if you are willing to go for it. So it's really up to you if you want to engage in the beauty that the combat system has to offer. Different characters offer different playstyles and depending on the weapons you wield you open up more deviations and different combos. The combat is also as smooth as it can be.

[h2]The RPG elements[/h2]
The RPG elements of building your character are light but set up in a smart way that really fits the theme of the game. I wont go into much detail and again you can choose to not really engage with the system but if you start doing so (for example later in the game) you'll have a lot of fun.

[h2]Does it feel dated?[/h2]
Stylistically it's beautiful and the game does not feel that dated. 
A lot of newer games can learn from the action and RPG elements you will find here.

[h2]Does it run on the Steam Deck?[/h2]
Yes, this game should be Steam Deck verified, because Proton was made with NieR:Automata in mind (no joke) and you'll feel that when you run the game. I played 90% of the game on the Steam Deck.",1689593657,1691140794,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I adore every aspect of this game, yet I have such a hard time going back to it, like many of the Nier/Drakengard games. The music and environments are a cinematic marvel, the characters feel so real and authentic even thought they are just characters in a video game (even more so amazing because they are androids.) I have never played a game that made me feel quite like Nier Automata did at the end. The only other game coming close being Drakengard 3. If you are looking to try a game in the series, I urge everyone to experience this one. Feelings aside, this game has great voice acting, beautiful environments, music that will make you swoon, combat that is so satisfying and rewarding to level up, and such a lovable cast of characters who feel very real in their struggles. I recommend this game to everyone I meet, but I also urge caution at the harrowing, heart-sobbing, tragically enchanting marvel that is Nier Automata.",1691128633,1691128633,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Lastly, it's not 'deep'. Its like a dummies guide to Psychology and Philosophy.

Telltale's The Walking Dead made me cry, sure, but Automata is the only game that made me tear up during ""final"" final credits instead. What an amazing experience. Glad that I went unspoiled about it for years and played it with zero knowledge now that I have a computer that is capable of running it.

Game's far from being new and considering that you are probably interested in it, I'll share only things that I [i]personally[/i] didn't really like about Nier: Automata:

‚Ä¢ Route B (9S's route) is straight up painful to replay. You are effectively forced to replay the game AGAIN after beating it for the first time with zero to none alterations to story compared to first Route A. Pretty much exact thing that we've seen in original Resident Evil. Imo second character's point of view should have been completely optional. Second Act of the story is locked until you beat Route B. Honestly a questionable decision because apart from couple of scenes and cutscenes, 95% of the Route B is a direct copy of Route A.
‚Ä¢ Yoko ""Yes, I loved playing NES when I was young, how can you tell?"" Taro. Overused twin stick shooter minigames in form of flight and hacking, especially during Route B. By the end of Route B I got so sick of it, I built 9S around direct combat instead of hacking.
‚Ä¢ Difficulty balance? What difficulty balance? Normal difficulty is too easy, hard difficulty is too unfair (unless you enjoy getting one-two shot by an enemy that is not the most common class I suppose). I guess you'll be able to finish on Easy using only one foot. Feels like that there's supposed to be a difficulty in between but it's missing.

And... that would be it, honestly. Oh, and minor spoilers but I feel like I definitely need to mention this - special thanks to dev team for letting us to finish and leave the game without burning ourselves out. When you finish Route C, you are given an ability to [spoiler]straight up purchase achievements you have locked with in-game currency. Story-related achievements are non-purchasable but you are able to pick up every misc. achievement you miss[/spoiler]. You are still free to stick around and unlock everything yourself, of course. However this is a great help if you feel that you are ""done"" with the game and developer doesn't force you to see everything (especially considering how grindy most japanese games are), they appreciate you for seeing Nier: Automata through the end and I absolutely love it.

Do give it a shot if you are into ""watashi no kokoro watashi no tamashi"" games. You won't regret it, trust me.",1690805300,1690805380,True,76,3,0.741571784019470215,0,True,False,False

The story, characters and world building is some of the best I have ever seen. It might not be the most visually stunning game, but the world is beautiful and has a very unique feel to it. The story is extremely deep, multilayered and has a lot of emotional moments, its one of those games you still think about months after you beat it, and the developers leave a lot of secrets for you to figure out on your own without directly telling you what is happening, which makes the story more satisfying when you piece everything together. The side quests do a really good job of deepening the characters and world, and a lot of major plot reveals happen in these, which you might miss if you don't do them. The combat is simple but very fluid and fun and has a decent variety of weapons and combos. If none of that sells you on the game, 2B is hot af. This game is easily a 10/10 and one of the most memorable games I have ever played. Also the sound track is god tier and probably top 5 best game sound tracks of all time.

There‚Äôs a choice you can make during the playable credits sequence of NieR Automata‚Äôs fifth and narratively conclusive ending: whether or not to make the ultimate in gaming sacrifices by helping a stranger, who you will never know or meet, with the game‚Äôs final challenge. It was a sacrifice I agreed to. I could say that I believed wholeheartedly that I wanted to help another player, especially since said final challenge is deliberately near-impossible, and it was only because of someone else‚Äôs sacrifice that I made it through. But in truth, I have no real answer as to why I willingly made the choice. The thought that keeps running through my head is a line from Matrix Revolutions: that the answer to why I persisted is simply because I chose to.

That ability to make carefully considered decisions that have no true purpose or meaning‚Äîthe very core of free will‚Äîis a defining human trait, and the fact that this is something that cannot be taught or given to other living beings is a problem NieR Automata is almost pathologically fascinated with. It‚Äôs a fact it dances with, argues with, screams at, cries about, and mourns from its first seconds until the moment its final credit rolls. No, director Yoko Taro doesn‚Äôt have answers to the questions that the game poses, but he engages with what it means to be human in ways no game operating in AAA space has before, and certainly not one where you spend countless hours stylishly slicing up robots while dressed like the ma√Ætre d‚Äô at a FetLife dinner party.

NieR Automata lets its anime-inspired freak flag fly in the early hours of the campaign, giving absolutely no indication of the depths it will reach. Taro knows that 2010‚Äôs NieR was a thoughtful but mechanically uninspired game, which is why he brought in action-game savants Platinum Games to help assist with the sequel‚Äôs numerous gameplay styles. Within this game‚Äôs first hour, it‚Äôs at once a scrolling-screen Gradius-style shooter, a full-3D hack-and-slash action adventure, a 2D platformer, a tactical RPG, and a large-scale mech-combat jamboree. Later, the ability to damage enemies through a Geometry Wars-style mini-game becomes a gameplay staple. Throughout NieR Automata, it‚Äôs as if Platinum Games is showing off, and if they earn that braggadocio it‚Äôs because the developer excels at every single genre field the game chooses to play in‚Äîa rare jack-of-all-trades that masters all.

Most of the game, however, is spent in 3D-action mode, exploring a city-sized open world that strangely alternates minute to minute between PlayStation 2-levels of graphical austerity and breathtaking, lush moments of natural beauty that weren‚Äôt possible on that system. And all of it is bolstered by one of the most eclectic and evocative musical scores ever bestowed on a video game.

The game takes place 8,000 years into the future, where humanity has been supplanted by a race of deadly robots as the dominant species. Man‚Äôs last hope of retaking the planet is in an army of hyper-powered, silver-haired androids acting under orders from our lunar-based government to cleanse Earth of the machines. We initially play as 2B, a leather-clad, cold-hearted, all-business soldier who ends up saddled with 9S, a hacker-model android with the personality of an awkward 14-year-old. Their mission is simple reconnaissance and errand-running at first, with a plethora of machine-crushing sidequests and plenty of the kind of varied, large-scale, multi-part boss fights that Platinum is famous for (and accessible here within a couple of playtime hours). The waters get muddy fast, though, once it turns out the robots may not all be the mindless killing machines humanity says they are.

It‚Äôs obvious upfront that something might be off, as the supposedly lethal robots are redolent less of Terminators or the Borg than they are of the kindly robots from Hayao Miyazaki‚Äôs Castle in the Sky, only dwarf-sized. Most of them wander aimlessly, and many of them don‚Äôt even attack when 2B or 9S wander too close. One particular robot, Pascal, waves the white flag the second he sees 2B, and invites her to a village where robots have discovered the futility of war, and have begun trying to figure out what to do with their sentience. Despite no physical resemblance or similarity to humans, across the world, the robots clumsily fumble toward humanity, savoring our joys, and dreading our mistakes in equal measure. One of the game‚Äôs more bizarre, yet oddly affecting moments has our heroes coming across a hidden enclave full of robots trying to approximate human love by rocking empty cradles back and forth while chanting the word ‚Äúchild,‚Äù miming sex acts on each other, and screaming out for someone‚Äîanyone‚Äîto hold them.

Despite working in a genre whose ethos more or less relies on the concept of killing anything that moves, at any given moment, the game confronts the player with the shared values and ongoing personal development of the Other, and gives us multiple options, including flat-out murder, for engagement with it. There are narrative and gameplay consequences and advantages that result from every decision. Even the necessary fights against the deadliest of characters have justifications that require a measure of understanding and empathy from the player. NieR Automata is the first game to truly stand up and greet ludonarrative dissonance as a friend, and actually start the conversation about our bloodlust versus our empathy, while not short-shrifting the argument for either side.

Taro employs every dirty game-design trick in the book to get his points across, up to and including some of the mind-trippy visual distortions in the game‚Äôs user interface, and it‚Äôs all in favor of story above all else, which never once takes the easy way out. Said story isn‚Äôt afraid of offering up a high body count, indulging in non sequiturs, or laying a guilt trip on a particularly cool gameplay segment, and in general is utterly fearless at bringing us face to face with what it means to have latent humanity in a game genre that so very often holds empathy in contempt. There‚Äôs power and glory to be had while playing NieR Automata, and perhaps the greatest testament to what‚Äôs been created here is how much of that glory involves mercy, not murder. And that, coming from the developer whose greatest moment prior to this one involved a gun-slinging witch punching the face of God into the sun, is miraculous.

Off the bat, the story is perfect for this kind of game, simplistic in it's story telling with a lot of subtext to be explored, characters comparable to the likes of studio ghibli, and successfully avoiding ludo-narrative dissonance. For the most part, the core gameplay isn't anything special but is robust and interesting enough to hold up across 60 hours without getting stale. I say for the most part because of a handful of bullshit difficulty spikes (mostly during remote control sections) and a lot of RNG heavy grinding, although the latter is mostly a result of completionism.
My main disappointment came from the potential of this world and the message behind the game. after finding out that only 6 of the endings are meaningful and the rest are jokes kind of removed the impact of even having 26 endings but the linearity of the main endings still creates a significantly rich story. I only hope that the prequels will make up for this.
After all I've said and done, I'd still highly recommend this game and as long as you expect to only have 6 significant endings you won't be disappointed by them (and you'd know when you're done), and don't be afraid to lower the difficulty if the bullshit spikes are hurting your enjoyment of the game.",1690550782,1690550782,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is constantly evolving in surprising ways much like the machine lifeforms you'll be combating throughout the story.

NieR:Automata doesn't just ask what it means to be a video game, but what it means to be a conscious being in a godless universe. Yoko Taro and the PlatinumGames crew have used the medium of video games to tell a story that can only be told through the interactive medium.

Edited 24th of March 2021
As of the 18th of March I cannot in good conscience recommend people buy this game on Steam, as Square Enix has released a version of the game, that has fixed many issues of the Steam version, on the Microsoft store, but refuse to update the existing version on Steam. 
I see this as a disgusting display of greed on the part of Square Enix.
I hope they update the Steam version of the game, but I am not holding out hope, that they will actually do this. As such i am leaving a now negative review.

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

As a lifelong gamer, I have experienced countless virtual worlds, but few have left a lasting impression as profound as Nier: Automata. This game is nothing short of a masterpiece, blending an emotionally charged narrative, breathtaking visuals, and exhilarating gameplay into an unforgettable journey.

From the very start, Nier: Automata grips you with its captivating story. The plot explores profound themes like identity, purpose, and the essence of humanity, all while unraveling a mesmerizing post-apocalyptic tale. The game's characters are richly developed, each carrying their own burdens, and their struggles resonate deeply with players. From the enigmatic 2B to the quirky 9S and even the rogue-like A2, the protagonists' journey is an emotional rollercoaster that tugs at your heartstrings and leaves you pondering long after you've turned off your console.

Visually, Nier: Automata is a breathtaking marvel. The world is gorgeously crafted, ranging from desolate ruins to lush forests, and each environment feels alive with meticulous detail. The contrasting landscapes complement the game's thematic depth, and the unique art style gives the game a distinctive and unforgettable look. Character designs are striking and complement their personalities perfectly, adding an extra layer of immersion to the overall experience.

However, the true brilliance of Nier: Automata lies in its gameplay. PlatinumGames' signature action-packed combat blends seamlessly with RPG elements, creating an addictive and fluid system that never ceases to amaze. The smooth transitions from intense aerial battles to ground-based combos make every encounter feel like a beautiful dance of blades. The variety of weapons, combined with a customizable pod that provides different abilities, ensures that combat remains engaging and satisfying throughout the game.

Furthermore, the game cleverly implements multiple gameplay styles, ranging from intense hack-and-slash sequences to bullet hell-inspired shoot-'em-up segments. These inventive changes keep the gameplay fresh and exciting, preventing any sense of monotony from setting in.

Beyond the main story, Nier: Automata features a plethora of side quests and optional content, each offering valuable insights into the game's world and characters. These diversions are thoughtfully crafted, contributing to the overall narrative and providing an opportunity to further connect with the beautifully crafted characters.

Moreover, the game's soundtrack is nothing short of spectacular. The hauntingly beautiful melodies, coupled with hauntingly poignant vocals, further amplify the emotional impact of key moments. Composer Keiichi Okabe's work is an auditory marvel, enhancing the immersive experience and making it an essential component of the overall package.

In conclusion, Nier: Automata is a gaming gem that leaves an indelible mark on all who venture into its world. It deftly combines an emotionally charged narrative, stunning visuals, and exhilarating gameplay to create an experience that transcends the confines of traditional video games. This is not just a game; it's an emotional odyssey that will stay with you long after the credits roll. If you are seeking a profound, thrilling, and emotionally rich gaming experience, Nier: Automata is an absolute must-play.",1689953756,1689953756,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well first thing first lets this game is a easy 10/10. I jumped into Nier automata completely blind i was expecting a basic game that was only popular because of 2b but man was I wrong. 

this game was a something new not like any other games i played before. the cinematic scenes are top tier, the combat in this game is really enjoyable with the option to choose many different weapons and fighting styles. the graphics and world in this game are just outstanding. this game replay ability is just endless and i don't think i could ever get bored playing this game. 

After beating this game i felt speechless and this game broke me i wish i could replay this game again without any knowledge of what happens again. If you are sitting down thinking hmm should i buy this game the answer is yes its not a waste of money most games i buy just end up never being played but this game take my word will be played.",1689214082,1689871060,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And if you've played any of his other games to completion, you'll know pretty much what to expect from this one. But if you aren't familiar with Yoko Taro, there are a few things you should know about him before listening to the hype. Bear in mind that none of these things are intended to dissuade you from playing [i]Automata[/i]--to the contrary, I very much think that you should!--but setting some expectations ahead of time will prepare you to have the best possible experience with this game.

The first thing you should know about Yoko Taro is that he is out to troll you. He knows what the average gamer will expect from a video game, and he will absolutely take full advantage of that knowledge to mess with you at every turn. Some of the ways he messes with you will be fun, subverting your expectations in an enjoyable way. Others will be frustrating beyond belief, but constructed in such a way that you will either feel compelled to overcome them or give up and throw the game on your backlog to gather dust. Be forewarned, this is true many times over for completionists--the man has no compunctions whatsoever about wasting your time, and it's easy to imagine that some of the decisions that made it into this game, did so solely because he thought they would be funny at your expense. None of them will prevent you from completing the story, but many of them will crop up in incredibly annoying ways if and when you go for 100% completion.

The other thing you should know about Yoko Taro is that he is weird, and his games reflect that. He is a man that wears the head of one of his characters over his own head at all times in public. (His answer changes every time someone asks him why.) He includes attractive women in skimpy outfits in his games, not for any purportedly thematic reason as some creative types do, but simply because he openly likes ogling them. (This should answer the all-too-common question of why 2B is wearing a maid outfit in [i]Automata[/i].) All of his games include outlandish (and often horrifying) plot developments and colorful characters who are all broken in a variety of strange and tragic ways. If anything, [i]Automata[/i] is easily the most grounded of all of his games up to this point, but those who have played the [i]Drakengard[/i] series or the original [i]NieR[/i] will know that isn't saying much.

[b]So if [i]NieR: Automata[/i] is a weird game with trollish elements made by a weird guy with a fetish for maid outfits and spherical head-helmets, why should you play it?[/b]

Because it is very, [i]very[/i] good. It will surprise you in ways I can't explain due to spoilers. It will delight you with its [i]beautiful[/i] soundtrack and deliciously smooth free-flowing combat, courtesy of the character action masters at PlatinumGames. It will shock you with revelations that completely recontextualize earlier parts of the game, making the multiple playthroughs required to see all of the endings (and the all-important ""true"" ending) feel earned and worthwhile. It is one of those rare games where everything, even the trollish bits, were included for a specific reason to elicit a specific reaction, and that reaction lands damn near every time. It's a roller coaster ride of a game, in more ways than one, and it's an [i]experience[/i] you won't quite get in almost any other game.

I talk in some of my reviews about intentionality in game design, usually in the context of a mediocre developer just throwing some stuff into their game because they thought it sounded good or because it's what other games are doing. [i]NieR: Automata[/i] is the antithesis of this way of doing things, down to the smallest details, like the options menu [spoiler]being structured like a console for the android you're controlling[/spoiler]. I can't think of a single thing about this game that wasn't incorporated for a reason, even if that reason is as silly as Yoko Taro wanting to mess with players by [spoiler]making it nearly impossible to catch a certain specific fish in order to complete a pointless log[/spoiler], just because he knows that will bother some people.

TL;DR: Play this game. Ignore the hype, go into it with an open mind, and see it through to the true ending (which requires three playthroughs, but trust me, that's a good thing).

ADDENDUM (minor spoilers for a sidequest): A quick note to those who harp on about the ""deep philosophical themes"" in this game--[spoiler]remember the ""Jean-Paul's Melancholy"" side quest? The one with the haughty existentialist machine who is too good for his followers' gifts? Remember how that quest ended? That's Yoko Taro laughing at you.

There are dozens of other reviews for that. All I want to say is that, if you do plan on playing this game, I'd recommend playing NieR Replicant, the game preceding NieR:Automata, first. The knowledge of things and events that occurred in NieR Replicant enhanced so many moments from NieR:Automata for me and I can assure you that I would have enjoyed the game much less without the knowledge I had from NieR Replicant. Also, NieR Replicant is just a great game in it's own right, so it shouldn't be a chore to play it. And if you don't want to play it and just want to play NieR:Automata or you want to play NieR:Automata first because it interests you more, then do that. I'm not your mom.

Also, just to make this an actual review of NieR:Automata:
the game is good and the soundtrack is good

The story, music, setting, and overall tone reminds me of Metal Gear Solid games (during their heyday back between 1999-2004) even if they gameplay and combat is rather different from those games. It's the sense you get when playing that you are taking part in a story that really, truly matters. The soundtrack is one of the best that I have ever heard in a game, I listen to it in my free time when I'm not even gaming and I almost never do that with any other games.

The way it plays is kind of a combination of a twin stick shooter (Pod mechanic) and a hack and slash/character action game but without an emphasis on combos. But there are also airborne sections which play like a mech style of game. It never got boring to me and I was really bummed when the credits rolled, not because the story was bad ...only because the story was over and I really wanted it to keep going. Luckily, I found out that the game has multiple endings and you have to play through it several times to get the true ending.

The voice acting and storytelling is top notch, it is better than many games with much higher budgets. There is a new Anime series that was recently released and it is equally well done. Yoko Taro (the writer/director of the game) is the greatest and I hope Square is working with him to make a sequel to this game, it would truly be a mistake not to. 

If you see this game available for $20, by all means, do grab it. Although it is totally worth $40, I own it on Steam and Nintendo Switch because that port was amazing.",1689619346,1689619346,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game takes place several millennia after the first installment, which is why you don't immediately recognize the world. However, all the important locations, although completely devastated, hidden, or expanded, are still there. Through archive data and dialogues, you can also learn why the world has evolved in this way.

The story is also on its own level. By repeatedly shattering the worldview, it can be compared to Attack on Titan. But there are also numerous side quests that add even more depth to everything. Along the way, you are constantly confronted with moral questions that are not so easy to answer and leave you pensive.

The gameplay is perfectly executed, as expected from Platinum Games. 2B controls in a hack-and-slash manner, while 9S provides a good variation through machine hacking, which also supports the worldbuilding by allowing us to experience the emotions and thoughts of the machines.

The graphics, and especially the soundtrack, are beautiful as well. I haven't seen anywhere else where the OST consists of a mix of different languages, which is intended to represent a kind of future language.

I've completed the game in its entirety for the second time now, including all the endings and side quests, and it has definitely made it into my top 10 games. I'm really excited to replay NieR: Replicant now.",1689600649,1689600649,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""NieR:Automata‚Ñ¢"" is a captivating gaming experience, presenting a rich and intricate lore that rivals the best anime series. It lets you dive headfirst into high-stakes battles and dramatic scenes.

The music and voice acting are second to none. The soundtrack, particularly when paired with the original Japanese voice acting, redefines excellence. The enchanting melodies linger long after the game ends, and the voice actors' performances are so compelling they leave a memorable imprint.

With no spoilers, I can't stress enough the thrill this game offers. The combat system is not just satisfying‚Äîit's immersive, pulling you right into the heart of the action. As you upgrade your weapons, you get to diversify your gameplay with innovative builds and combos, making each battle uniquely exhilarating.

""NieR:Automata‚Ñ¢"" boasts a variety of well-crafted mini-games, from hacking mechanics to 2D platformer sequences and thrilling spaceship battles‚Äîthere's never a dull moment. The 9S section could be a bit repetitive, but it's a minor flaw easily overlooked due to the fresh narrative perspective it provides.

The storytelling is an artistic feat, visually and narratively. It subtly conveys profound messages, delivering a powerful narrative through epic scenes and touching dialogues. It creates room for player contemplation, stimulating your imagination. The epic boss fights, underscored by the harmonious music, and the meticulous character development elevate the narrative to new heights.

The story and lore of ""NieR:Automata‚Ñ¢"" have created an indelible impression. The unforgettable characters‚Äî2B, 9S, A2, and a host of intriguing side characters‚Äîwill remain etched in my memory. Their evolving relationships, filled with friendship and romance, resonate deeply. It's a rare game that can leave such a profound impact, earning it a well-deserved spot among my top 5 favorites.

I won't delve into the gameplay side of things, it's pretty universally accepted that the gameplay of NieR:Automata is mediocre. The story is seen as absolutely incredible though, which it isn't, it's also fairly mediocre.

I don't doubt that when the game came out the story was profound and revolutionary, now though, it's just your typical ""AI/human realises AI can be conscious"" story. You've seen stuff like this way more times already, and a lot of those times done far better. The characters are one dimensional and experience a very linear character arc. AI believes machines aren't conscious and they want to kill them all; AI faces proof that the machines are conscious, still doesn't believe they're conscious and wants to kill them; AI after a lot of proof realises that the machines are conscious but still kills them anyway; machines did something bad to the AI, now AI wants to kill all machines and believes they're not conscious; AI realises machines are conscious and no longer wants to kill them; THE END.

The characters also have additional character arcs involving them realising they like someone as a friend, in an equally linear way.

Side quests barely have any story to them, it's mainly that they'll throw a random concept out there like idk a machine having a sister, and then just leave you with that concept without any real conclusion aside from ""they lived happily ever after"".

For the first 20h, basically no story is told at all, nothing profound, nothing really that interesting, there's a couple mysteries thrown around too, but we know literally nothing about them. Then for the next 10h or so you'll find out what all that story before meant, and then for the last 5h or so you'll get the conclusion to that story with some honestly fairly decent plot twists.

I'd give this a mixed review if I could, but well steam doesn't have that. If you've never experienced any media portraying the same themes as this game, and or you don't really have any of your own opinions about this, then you'll probably thoroughly enjoy the story, otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it, aside from just taking it out of your backlog.

I spent a lot of time on route A (32 hours) and mostly enjoyed it when I played but found it forgettable and it rarely stuck with me when I wasn't playing.  The combat is mostly combos and dodging and frankly I'm just not very good at that.  I found the opening hour impossible until I changed started playing on easy.  I often didn't know what I was supposed to be doing and there often seemed to be very intentional barriers to actually enjoying it.  

All of that changed toward the end of route A and the story really picked up.  Route B isn't a repeat AT ALL-  combat was suddenly a twin-stick shooter and it was much quicker (maybe 7 hours).  Routes C/D took another 11 hours and the story got really intense.  Ah- that's what people are  talking about.  I get it now.

It was 50% off at some point, so i decided to show support for the developer for making such a...""visually exciting"" character.

But in playing this game, there's much more to it. 
There's simply much more to this game than can be experienced by reading spoilers and looking at artwork.

-The voice acting, and even mimicry of human ticks mid-conversation. 
-The Sound track and music scored by a professional music production studio (MONACA)
-The cinematography and spectacle of cutscenes and boss introductions
-the way the game's meta settings line up with in-game story telling: your hud and settings are actually supposed to represent the settings of the android you're controlling
-the great attention to detail: every npc has dialogue, every item has a description, every weapon has a story (in the literal sense) that unlocks as you level it up
-the realistic depictions of characters: your main cast aren't just one liners, or silent protagonists; they have internal dialogue that is not shared with the player, but can be inferred from body language
-an extremely full world of interactables: unlike most game's that advertise ""open world"", this world really feels fleshed out; you may be annoyed by invisible walls here and there, but the entire world is chock full of interactables and rewards you for exploring and being curious

Because of all of the above, the world created in this game is incredibly easy to become immersed in.

This doesn't even being to talk about gameplay, of which most ""story driven narrative"" games oft fall short.
If you're complete dogs**t at video games (like myself), you can turn on or off easy mode at any time and simply advance the story, like watching a very convoluted mystery/action thriller.
This game would have been good enough if it were just a movie; but when they could have just stopped there, they decided to slap real and challenging gameplay on top of it, as well as vast variety in battle styles.

This game is amazingly fleshed out, and i understand why it had received the ""GOTY"" title for 2017.
It's very cliche to say some bull like, ""this is more than a game"" or ""this is a piece of art"", but once in a while a game like this will come and very much deserve those sayings.

Desperately wanted to enjoy this, and I'm sure it's a fantastic experience if you're looking for one.
But I have to address the absolute impossibility of playing this on a keyboard: Even from the very beginning, any top-down section is an absolute mental effort to use WASD and arrows at the same time, while also managing extra presses like firing and dodging.
The camera usage is definitely thought out, but as someone who is used to having fully camera control it is both infuriating and disorienting to manage: The game certainly does its best to make the angles work, but in 3D sections with enemies surrounding you, it is too much to try and wrangle the camera to see what is going on, especially at the same time as the combat.
The bullet hell aspect is definitely interesting, but simply not manageable with all the other problems one has to worry about in fights.
And finally, the reason I'm here instead of trying to get better: Dying (at least in the prologue) sets you back to the very beginning. I can possibly learn Marx's (subtle name, I know) attacks under ideal circumstances, but I can't be bothered to experiment when every failure sets me back to redo 20 minutes of tutorial (and the twin-stick-designed sections).

The combat system based on chips is an interesting idea and it is implemented pretty good.
Experimenting with it was fun.

The difficulty levels are unbalanced, while normal is too easy, hard (the next level) is too much, not always, but quite often, unless you are overleveled.

The plot is fine, some moments are really nice, but I can't say it is that great as a lot of people wrote.

The gameplay isnt particularly fun, consisting mostly of button-mashing, the barrier for entry is unreasonably high, requiring 3 and a half playthroughs to reach the conclusion, and the worldbuilding is very lackluster, explaining maybe 10% of what the game has to show. And yet, I still gave the game a 9/10. The story here is, without a doubt THE BEST video game story I've ever played. The music is top notch, though not really comparable to any other OST with its uniqueness, and the graphics make me forget I'm playing a video game sometimes. I cant dive into the story without discussing spoilers, so I'll leave you with this: this game is not worth buying UNLESS you actually put in the time to play through to all five endings. If you do, however, you will have an experience unlike any other. I did not enjoy my time with this game, but I most assuredly will next time I play.

Terrible things happen, and people suffer for what seems like no reason. Yes, this world is terrible, but it's also very beautiful, and it's worth fighting for. 

Real talk tho, the story is absolutely phenomenal. The graphics and music comp are beautiful (astounding, really), and the game play is satisfying and challenging. The game play switches between hack-and-slash. shoot-em-up, and even some bullet-hell type stuff, but it blends and seams together perfectly. To get the full experience of the story, you'll have to play through it at least 3 times, but I swear to you, it's worth it. Just stick through it to the end, listen to the different stories the game offers you. Each story is just as impactful and heart-wrenching as the last.

Some spoiler territory following, but nothing too specific:

[spoiler] I wanted to 100% complete the game. Get every single fish, item, pod, weapon upgrade, quest, every ending. And I got pretty far too. Maybe about 80% completion overall. But then I was left with one last decision by one of the final endings (E). And you know what? I might regret that decision in the future, but I came to the realization that nothing really lasts forever. And I realized that I was ready to part with everything I had worked so hard for in the game, so I did. And I hope it ends up helping someone in the long run, as others have helped me during my play-through. [/spoiler]

This is one of the best games I've ever played in my life. It is something that I will never be able to experience for the first time ever again. And I hope that this review can get others to at least give it a try.

I also want to thank anyone and everyone who has ever sacrificed to help a total stranger, even one you might hate. [spoiler] Thank you Zhang, for your sacrifice. It really meant a lot to me. [/spoiler]

I love this game. It's not as challenging as you'd think; it's actually pretty easy (in normal difficulty). You don't need to do the sidequests (atleast very much). I was expecting dark souls difficulty, but I didn't really mind. The game is lovely; Yoko Taro's more lewd aspects are driven out with the self-destruct feature. (did you know he lost his hat recently..?)

The game has so much replay value and it is highly recommended you replay to get the real final endings. Of the 5 main endings, the final is so beautiful and well worth it to get. The other joke endings are also very fun to get but for anyone who has played Replicant, one of the endings may be worth the hard grind to get. 
It honestly is my favourite game of all time, with it's complexity and characters with so much depth you will probably grow very attached to each of the main protagonists. 
The gameplay is also very fun. One of the best things in this game is being able to evade as it makes combat very satisfying weaving in combos and evading, then either robot pew or more hacking and slashing. The other type of combat during the second playthrough is also very fun and mixes up how you play.
The music in this game is so well made and I've definitely listened it to outside of the game. However, when you do hear songs in game while you play it becomes the most hype thing ever. Interesting when you do the second playthrough combat, the music changes and it's a vibe.

Let's start with the good. The combat, writing and combat scenarios feel extremely fresh in an already tried and true genre. Especially when the game forces you to play a 2d sidescroller suddenly or a top-down bullet hell, its very refreshing and a cool mix of ideas. What doesnt work is that this game's world is extremely empty, it's so barebones it almost feels like a bug or something. I thought a few times that enemies or assets had failed to load because it was so barren. Pair this with an incredibly out-dated save mechanic where auto-saves are not a thing and the fact that you have to replay the game several times to get the ""proper"" ending/story. This just feels cheap to me, I don't want to sit through / force myself  to play the same game multiple times with slight differences (Route A / B) just to experience the good part (Route C).

I'll preface my review by saying that this style of action game is perhaps not for me and I obviously haven't finished the entire thing (...but why would you continue to play something if you're not enjoying it after nearly 9 hours...?). Though I have had a lot of fun playing through DMC titles back during the PS2 golden era, and I'm no stranger to punishing titles like Dark Souls or Hollow Knight, this game feels so bland...

Starting with the superficial, it's not a very visually exciting world. Aside from the amusement park, the world is uninspired and devoid of detail. The character models look great and are very well animated, but they're in total contrast to the incredibly muddy and repetitive textures everywhere else.

The combat is fine, plenty of weapon variety and skills to choose from, but it's nothing special. Every encounter plays out essentially the same way.

The difficulty scaling is ridiculous. Normal difficulty level is boring, button mashing is all that's required to progress. Hard difficulty is absurd... the majority of enemies can basically one-hit kill you... and yet that's what 'Very hard' explicitly states - one hit to die. So then, why make 'Hard' difficulty essentially the same thing? On Normal difficulty, you can kill enemies that are 20 levels higher than you without too much trouble. On Hard, you get annihilated by enemies that are even 1-2 levels lower than you if you're not paying the utmost attention. 

What exacerbates the nonsensical difficulty scaling even more is the death system. People online seem to compare the death system to that of Dark Souls. That's just objectively incorrect. Dark Souls titles punish a death by potentially erasing any 'un-banked' 'exp/cash'. You [b] still [/b] have your equipment and your stats (stats that are baked into your character and have a much greater bearing on your build and the difficulty). Death in Nier is FAR more punishing. If you die in Nier, you lose all of your chips which cost a fortune to buy and upgrade. In Nier, your chips are by far the most important part of a build. Without those chips, you are [b] massively [/b] weakened, and should you die attempting to retrieve them (very likely on Hard difficulty), They're all gone - I hope you enjoying grinding mobs! It's just pointless and unnecessarily punishing...

I will refrain from commenting on the story, as that is surely something that needs to be appreciated from at least one completion.

That being said, once the 45 minute prologue section is over, it's a very fun ARPG, which already has a very interesting story about an hour in (it took me like 2 hours to beat the prologue because I hadn't connected a controller for my first couple of attempts). The KB&M controls are BAD, playing with a controller allows much better flow while fighting and much more precise movement.

OK, first impressions guys, first impressions.
I hate the prologue already, hate it with a passion. The first thing you have to do is complete a long 30 minute stage, which gets pretty difficult near the end, with no saves, not one. on top of that, a lot of it is just cinematics and easy fights with low level enemies. The ONLY part that's truly difficult is what I HOPE is the last part of the prologue (Edit: It wasn't), a big ol boss fight against two giant sawblade arm things. I've already died twice to that boss, and I wouldn't mind so much if I didn't have to WASTE THIRTY MORE MINUTES GETTING BACK TO WHERE I WAS! Even Dark Souls hasn't annoyed me this much because they usually have a few campfires rather close to the boss, but nah. If I decide to play again and get past the prologue I'll edit the review to reflect my thoughts on the rest of the game, but I really am not happy with my purchase right now.",1688345805,1688438117,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

For these reasons, I can confidently say this is one of the greatest, if not THE greatest game ever made.

For being a sequel, it's presentation of its story is so well done you won't need to have played the predecessor Nier Replicant. Yet the way the story is understandable both with and without playing Replicant, it can usually drive you to play the first Nier just based on how good it felt to experience Automata. 

The game-play balances hack-and-slash, bullet hell, retro mini-games, and a mix of all the former in a unique and incredibly fun way. On the surface, it may seem repetitive and uninspired with games like the Devil May Cry series or Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance being staples of the hack-and-slash genre. Despite, all that being said, Automata perfected hack-and-slash with other game genres in a rewarding and enticing manner done like no other game.

The design is simply impeccable. While the game depends heavily on a good operating system (namely your GPU), the landscapes, character models, areas, and effects are brilliant if your system handles it. 

The voice acting of Automata is some of the greatest ever performed in both English and Japanese Every voice actor nails their role and the performance of 9S's English voice actor is genuinely the best video game voice acting performance ever.

The music is yet another fantastic part of the Nier franchise. Not only does it tend to fit with the story, it adapts to the game and evolves to your situation. The chaos language and having both narrative value and being beautifully composed make for one of the most gorgeous soundtracks across all MEDIA. Only rivaled to it's predecessor Replicant.

The game has tons of replay value with its various endings and three routes. It builds upon it's story with the fact so much is left up to player interpretation. Not in a confusing and disappointing way but rather an interesting approach that leads you to delve deep into the lore and full understanding of it's lore and narrative.

In conclusion, I highly recommend NieR:Automata. This game is one of the most emotionally touching and well written video games ever.

The save system is just bad. Limited areas for manual saves only. 
And a just bizarre choice of making deaths have a corpse run mechanic or lose actual items. 
Combine those things together with a level progression system that wants you to grind to keep up with monster levels, its just a stack of choices that are designed to artificially extend the time the game takes.

it contributes alot to the plot of the game

The side scrolling levels and mecha levels are just pointless additions. Rather than trying to make 2 more mini games, I would have preferred a more polished main game, i.e. combat.

 The story is absolutely amazing and one of the most interesting ideas I have ever seen. You have to play through the game multiple times to get all the details, but at least the first three playthroughs are different, after which you'll unlock chapter selection and be able to view other endings more easily.

The combat is very comfortable, the smoothly moving camera gives an even better effect of the feeling of combat. There are tons of different weapons and skills to decorate your characters with and play the way you want.

The graphics are very nice, but many areas get really foggy and the environment sometimes seems a little blurry. There are several graphic mods that can also transform your interface, but everything looks attractive even without mods.

Exultant? Triumphant? Satisfied? Do you want to shake your fist at the screen or elicit a primal scream?

I felt none of these finishing Nier: Automata. In fact, my heart was eerily quiet. I stared at the computer screen for several moments.

In silent appreciation for one of the most atmospheric, expertly paced, astonishingly well realised worlds I have ever had the privelege to play.

But before we get to that, I want to gush about the music.

The music! My god the music!

From the moment you take your first steps on this superb story driven, existentialist action/drama game about a surrogate proxy war fought between the remnants of humanity (Androids) and the machines that killed them, you find yourself gripped by a sweeping orchestral/industrial soundtrack that is as thought provoking as it is blood pumping. In contrast to most games, for which the soundtrack is something of an afterthought, the music sets the tone here, spanning eery desert wastes, delapidated city ruins and a bizzare machine-run utopic themepark with equal aplomb. Of particular note is Birth of a Wish , a thumping, gloriously cacophonic industrial/gregorian chant played during one of the later mission in the game, Twisted Religion. Never has a piece of music in a video game fit a level so perfectly and never has the argument been made as emphatically as Nier: Automata has that music is an integral part of video gaming as a whole. 

It's a mesmerising underpinning for an ostensibly simple action game. What masquerades as a simple bullet hell/melee combo action game about Androids fighting Machines is actually an atonishingly well realised, if simple, tale about what it means to be human. Throughout the game you encounter machines aping human tendencies, such as declaring their independence or putting on a play, or giving some twisted simalacrum of human emotion in their desperate attempts to become sentient. The Androids behave similarly with main characters and standouts 2B, a stoic, tough-minded female android with a heart of gold, and 9S, a well intentioned, helpful, sweet-but-naieve male android, slowly evolving beyond their original programming and developing the ability to feel, while fighting the urge to do so. After all, emotion is exclusive to human experience, isn't it?

I could go on about the multiple playthroughs told from the perspective of different characters, the almost clinical but gorgeous art direction, the layers of subtle world building invoked in each interaction or each item description. It goes on and on.

The end result is breathtaking. A world as sterile and eerily devoid of life, as it is joyous and brimming with emotion. It's a story that tugs on the heartstrings and reminds us that we all bleed red, even as we wave different colored flags or wear different flesh-colored (or shaped) suits.

Nier: Auomata is a masterpiece, a once-in-a-generation game that inspires you to question what it means to be human. That you have a lot of fun doing so, battling a diverse cast of machines in varied forms across the breadth of a beautifully designed and lonely world, is just the icing on an already delicious, michelin-star level cake.

It annoys me to no end how the public will take open ended story tropes dished out by the author on an emotional whim and say they are ingenious, a true masterpiece. But no, that line of thinking is for the ones who wish to convey to others that they possess higher IQ than what they actually have. There is a method that must be adhered to in order to tell a congruent story. For example, if you take time to detail an item in your story, it better be of some consequence to the ending.

We seem to live in a world where conveyed emotions through music, color schemes, and sobbing characters constitute a good story. But, ladies and gentlemen, that is not a story, that is the icing you put onto the story. Story is a clear objective for the main characters that aligns with the theme the author is trying to present, the cake if you will. Now, not to say Nier Automata does not have a story, it does, and despite a world full of games without one, Nier has a theme as well. But this story is 90% icing and 10% cake. It doesn't even have a clear antagonist, the heart of a story, other than some ambiguous man vs man's nature dilemma. Which, of course means it doesn't have a satisfying ending, despite the options you choose. Which brings me to the rest of the game.

The game is decent in a lot of areas but it's lacking in so much more. Game-play mechanics that force a player to play a style or character they might not want, backtracking upon backtracking, and level design that is not fluent or very intuitive, meaning it's more of a chore to get through parts than it is fun running through them.

Overall, Platinum Star did their job with the combat. However, unlike Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, there's more to this game than just action. Most of the Nier story elements drag Platinum Star's showcase down. There's something to be said about keeping it simple, and that's why DMC and Bayonetta worked, and why Nier struggles to do the same.

Anyway, this is the last Nier title I'll ever spend my time on. I wish the best for the team, as this setting does have potential, but I'm not holding my breath and moving on to the next promising title out there.",1562996370,1686894127,False,0,0,0,38,True,False,False

Cons :

3. There is NO AUTOSAVE as the game clearly mentions (repeatedly)

5. The map isn't technically open-world as there are lots of places that can only be accessed via a specific route that is not always obvious
6. The waypoint system sucks (if censored, the word I said is : ""saaaaa-aaaa-cks"")

NieR: Automata es el resultado la excentricidad de su autor, Yoko Taro, con la mente consumida por Drakengard y un presupusto limitado pero suficiente para dar cabida a otro delirio hecho videojuego. Es as√≠ que el producto final es fabuloso y deficiente a partes iguales.

NieR: Automata es una maravilla en lo que a argumento respecta. Filos√≥fico, extra√±o y, gracias a su paleta de colores y banda sonora, tambi√©n atmosf√©rico. Es una obra sinigual que desprende un aura que dificilmente vas a encontrar en alguna otra parte; pero a su vez cuenta con un combate mon√≥tono y est√° repleto de carencias tales como los escenarios, pobremente elaborados, lleno de paredes invisibles y ausentes de detalle; o el que es posiblemente el peor minimapa que vi en mi vida.

Y aunque estos problemas tienen su impacto, pierden importancia cuando la jugabilidad var√≠a de formas muy imaginativas, la m√∫sica maneja los tiempos de forma perfecta y la crisis existencial te pega.

Por desgracia este port a PC es algo malo y requiere de mods para correr apropiadamente, as√≠ como tambi√©n tuve que instalar un parche para eliminar el mouse smoothing.

The overall story and setting is interesting. It's pretty obvious earlier in the game the message it's going towards, but it's still nice to go through it, and the twists are interesting. Just make sure you play it past the first 2 ""endings"" or you'll miss the more interesting part of the story!
The only annoying part is the small world. You'll be going to the same areas again and again and again and again and again if you want to do the sidequests. The underlying story for some of the sidequests is interesting, but they're mostly fetch quests, so not really interesting gameplay wise. Upgrading all the weapons is also not needed. I mostly just stuck to a set for the whole game.
The music is really good. I liked listening to it. It adds to the vibe of the world. Though it too can get repetitive if doing all the side quests and farming all materials. So I would recommend to not treat it as a MMORPG and go mats farming for 2 days...

The most difficult part of the game has got to be, by far, the controls.
Installing the mod ""NieR Automata Mod Helper (NAMH)"" is a MUST. It's a helper mod that helps install other mods. And the first one to add is ""NieR Automata Input Overhaul Mod (NAIOM)"". Without this one the controls would have been impossible. Seriously, spend a little bit of time to install NAMH and NAIOM. Once that's installed, the controls would still be annoying at times, but wasn't a deal breaker. The mods also fix some of the bugs.",1686436995,1686437044,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Throughout the natural course of the story you will play as several different characters. This is a mostly-enjoyable experience - but the game lacks when playing as ""9S."" You see, 9S has a special gimmick as a scanner-model type android, which is the Hacking Minigame that everyone deeply hates. And for good reason - to be honest, it sucks. A lot of it is mandatory as well, whether because you actually need to hack to progress in the story or because 9S lacks so much in damage that you may as well just resort to hacking. Some of the hacking experience almost made me not recommend the game, actually. It's silly to force players to progress in this way when they came to fight as a hot android lady. Not to mention, the game has a very weak story - Personally, when playing a story game I seek something that makes me feel genuine emotion, but the story is not told in such a way that any dramatic cutscene actually strikes as saddening or anything at all...

One mechanic I will praise is the Plug-in Chip function, essentially allowing you to make your own ""build"" for the lack of a better term. There are several categories of chips that you can gather to enhance your preferred experience. You can collect or purchase these and even fuse them to make better chips under certain requirements, and I find this to be a very cool idea, however, if you die you will need to recollect your chips off your last body lest you lose them forever. Dying is usually not a problem in this game though, as it is very easy most of the time (aside from the Hacking Minigames, which can often be really frustrating and at some parts even difficult - but you'll not die from these) unless you're on Hard mode. Any other difficulty is a breeze.

Something I do not enjoy is the side quests, which is unfortunate because you can gain a lot of valuable rewards from doing them. Most of them are very dull and dare I say boring, but the story quests can be fun though I think some just drag on way too long.

Despite the many flaws the game has, the characters are very memorable and fascinating nonetheless which is one strength I do think it has - 2B, 9S, and A2 will always be remembered fondly in my heart.

Regardless, the game is worth the experience, which is why I will recommend it, although in reality it is just ""okay."" The game is somewhat fun when you're actually fighting and slaying machines, but overall is just a very ""meh"" experience.",1679384710,1686414218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Can't say much about the PC port itself, but as a game, it's very close to a masterpiece (in my humble opinion). I enjoy the hack-n-slash combat and combos you can do between weapon types, the variety of ranged options and skills to use with your pods is a good way to call back on the magic system back in the first NieR.

It's story is deep and makes you think about so many things, but only if you pay attention to it, otherwise it's just a fun combat game. For those coming back from NieR: Replican/Gestalt, these details were lovely (and painful) to witness! There are plenty of philosophical analysis of the story and it's message around the internet so I won't get into that in my review as I'm not great at writing my thoughts out.

I haven't finished my second play-through (you HAVE to play through four times to see the full game) and I'm about to just stop and uninstall... and I NEVER fail to finish a game. It just isn't fun enough. 

The Pros:
The overarching theme is appealing.
There's mass potential for deep, rich story with tons of twists.
The concept of playing through as more than one character is neat.
The area biomes were a good choice. Forest, industrial, desert, aquatic, urban. 
Fighting gameplay is well executed.
The hacking mini game gameplay is good, and actually integrates into the main game fairly well.
2B has a nice back sss..... story. The game exposes it to you plenty.
Multiple endings wasn't nearly as annoying in this game as it usually is.


The Cons:
The graphics are borderline PS2 at times. The are dozens of spots where the devs clearly just said ""f-it"" with the textures and geometry. The area around the bridge to the theater in particular has got to be some of most amateurish texture composition I have seen in a top tier game in the last 15 years. There are no detailed graphics settings, so you can't crank the game to ""melt my GPU mode"" even if you have a high spec PC, which wouldn't need to be much since this is clearly using some old gen game engine. Just about any other 2017 game looks better than this game. I'd say 90% of the games graphics went to the characters, which is valuable for exactly one character... (butt, I mean, but then that's just pandering anyway.) 5% went into foliage, 3% into the water, 2% got spread across the rest of the game.

The music you hear the most is cringy and basically forced down your throat. Some songs in some parts are OK, but man, Pascal's village.... by mid second play through I straight couldn't take it anymore and turned the music actually off. There's also some funky logic with how the game chooses when and for how long to play a track. You'll do a quest that changes the music, and then the whole area you are in gets saturated in that song, but not in a good way. It gets super uncomfortable. The logic that good BGM is never noticed applies; the music stands out too much.

The characters are flat as paper (with exception of maybe 9S). 2B is little better than a blowup doll flashing her can as much as the game dares to get away with. ""Running butt simulator"" I keep joking with my GF. A2 looks interesting, but I hardly got to see her. I suspect she is main for the third or fourth play through, but I can't be bothered to find out. Moving on, the director can't seem to decide which character has what personality. At times 2B will be dangerously curious about the goings on, and 9S will have to pull her back by reminding her that ""it's forbidden."" butt... I mean... but then the next scene it's the other way around. It's so jarring to have your characters flip around on you like that. Ironically, the robots have more personality. Lastly, the blindfold thing is just strange. If it was one of the characters only, for very good reason, that would have been cool... butt, I mean, but on both mains it's just weird. One might even say ""creepy.""

The world FEELS microscopic. Yeah, there are areas like the desert or the ruined city that are unmistakably large, but there is just zero content there. This is one of the few games where I felt like I actually should take all the side quests just to try and help fully flesh out a game. It's also one of the most closed open world games I have played in a while. The worst part is they doubled down on shrinking the world by making your stay in any one area brief. You spend all of 350 seconds in the desert area before you're back in the main camp. The thing that really irked me though was the buildings. These things are massive concrete honeycomb play grounds with plenty of places to hide treasures and fun..... and you basically never go in one. They are effectively reduced to massive stone cubes filling the world.

The controls don't work well on PC, which I guess is partly my fault for not using a controller. Worse still there are no settings to fix some of the problems. In particular I would like to put run/dodge on one of my mouses thumb buttons, l337 Dark Souls style, but the game just doesn't have the ability. The mouse doesn't work well for shooting when is side view, and Doesn't work well for hacking game. So I found myself jumping to keyboard for those things, then back to mouse. 

Bottom line, I don't see myself finishing this game, and I always finish my games.",1686154558,1686154558,False,5,0,0.487736970186233521,0,True,False,False

I will be honest to say that I was not enjoying the game at the beginning because I had set of wrong expectations. As I continue to play through multiple routes until the end, I began to enjoy the game more especially the storytelling, music, characters & theme thrown in. Only when I trying to 100% the game while listening to the game analysis, I began to see what is the intention of the developer & appreciate the game even more.

[h1]Story[/h1]
It's meh, the story swings but does not hit. It's supposed to be very sad but every one who dies I don't care about because you hardly meet them or would die sooner or later of random super-natural reasons.
Side quest are mostly filler with little story but the game likes to pretend by putting sob music, it works only for the first 2 times. (I am spoiled a bit from The Witcher 3)

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Gameplay is pretty good ,the hack and slash + bullet hell is fun and challenging although combos are difficult to execute because it's a japanese game. The other mode with robots is a MASTERPIECE, I want to reincarnate as a saw centipede.
Tends to suffer from lack of enemy variety and the RPG thing were enemies level up with you in numbers alone.

The world is pretty dull, I get that it is a post-apocalypse but did it need to set in the post communist blocks of russia. I am not asking for the Last Of Us but when you start game there so many places were you think you can enter a building only to be surprised by an invisible wall.
Would have preferred to have the main area be on top of collapsed buildings were you had to jump from block to block to reach your destination and die if you fell instead of this walk in park flat zone.

The entire game all 50 hours of it happens in sunny daytime washed in white, I really would have liked to see the stars in the desert like in Red Dead Redemption. Everything is lit the same way all the time, you have white haired characters on white concrete(or sand) on white background sky with their white pods firing mostly white projectiles at dirt brown enemies. (in hindsight, it really is bad)

Game left me meh.

[h1]Detailed story review below[/h1]

[spoiler]
Route A:
It's kinda uneventful you meet 2 guys, meet them again, kill one and then kill the other one, with boss battles in between.

Route B:
Should have been cut or play only the different chapters.
The game does even bother give you a preview of it like in Route C.

Route C:
Finally it's starts, but just ends.

Route D and E:
Haven't bothered looks like different cut scenes that you get by save scumming the last minute.
The game does not care about these 2 ending despite it being supposed the full ending.

So the game is supposed to feel sad but:
- Your squad mates in the first mission die but you don't know them, they don't even have names

- The resistance is the most human like and are the ones you fight for, for the majority/all of the game.
You save them early on and nothing bad ever happens to them at all, their problems are missing a fuel filter, sorting crates and some missing supplies.
The world is on fire/breaking apart literally and they comically fine.
Giant mecha attack, fine.
Earth is collapsing near them in a giant crater, fine.
Boss battle with flying boulder worm, fine
Machine invasion, Yorha infected with virus that makes them kill people, world is on fire, giant castle in the sky and they are just DANDY selling you stuff.
Forgot about eldritch  horror approaching coast.

- The village people die, I don't care about them, they are cartoons. If the game wanted me to care about them why not let me play more as a robot like in the first part in Route B where you play as a small robot trying to help his brother.
Route B should have been 9S having to be play the role of different machines in order to infiltrate some organization/cult.

- The children commit suicide while being defended (and not harmed), but before that happens:
The racing flyer commits suicide because he isn't the fastest one.
The karate bot wants to die in combat because pride ? ? ?
The robot that contemplates life throws himself to his death (actually very funny in hindsight the timing is just perfect, feels like 9S should have said before ""Do a flip"" like in Futurama).
An ENTIRE cult of death, made out of robots massacred themselves.

Are you kidding me ? How can you not expect any robot to kill themselves when you are not looking ? No wonder I felt nothing.
Forgot about those robots doing the Romeos and Julietas play at the amusement park.

- 9S dies, nevermind we've got a backup just fill him in on the details and it's just fine.
- B2 dies, nevermind she now haunts A2 which becomes her to an extent.
- A2 survies.
- Popola and Devola maybe die.
You know what would I do if they didn't show up to help enter the tower ?
Leave, remote control one of the guards send to defend the tower and just hack the tower.
There is no point in the game where remote controlling and hacking are ever spotted by the machines.

The story swings but does not hit.

And now for the stuff left unresolved and is more interesting than the normal playthru:
- Throughout the game the machines that you fight seem to be posesed and unwilling to attack you and even wishing for death to escape pain. This is never answered by the game and seems to be the real enemy of everyone it also has more emotional impact.
- What about the machine gifts, those visions from 9S.

One such gem is NieR: Automata, a game that transcends boundaries and captivates players with its mesmerizing beauty and thought-provoking narrative. And for me, as someone on the autism spectrum, this game has become a source of incredible solace and tranquility.

From the very first moment I delved into the post-apocalyptic world of NieR: Automata, I was enveloped by its hauntingly melodic soundtrack. The ethereal tunes, blending with the stunning visuals, created a symphony of harmony that resonated deeply within me. The game's ability to evoke such strong emotions through its music is nothing short of magical.

One of the aspects that makes NieR: Automata truly special is its exploration of existential themes and the intricacies of human emotions. It delves into the depths of what it means to be alive, to question one's purpose, and to forge connections in a world teetering on the brink of despair. As someone on the autism spectrum, these themes resonate with me on a profound level, providing a sense of understanding and validation that is both comforting and empowering.

The gameplay mechanics of NieR: Automata are elegantly crafted, offering a seamless blend of action, exploration, and role-playing elements. The combat is fluid and exhilarating, allowing for a satisfying level of customization and strategy. But beyond the adrenaline-pumping battles, there is a soothing rhythm to the gameplay that brings a sense of calm to my autistic mind. The repetition of actions and the focus required to master the game's mechanics become a meditative experience, soothing my senses and providing a sanctuary from the chaos of the world.

Furthermore, the characters in NieR: Automata are masterfully developed, each with their own unique stories and struggles. As an autistic individual, I often find it challenging to navigate the complexities of human emotions and social interactions. However, through the beautifully crafted narratives of these characters, I am offered a window into the vast spectrum of human experiences. It allows me to empathize, connect, and learn in ways that are deeply meaningful to me.

NieR: Automata is a testament to the power of video games as a form of artistic expression and emotional connection. It provides a safe haven, a world where my autistic self can find solace, understanding, and a sense of belonging. It celebrates the beauty of diversity, embracing the complexities of the human condition and reminding me that my neurodivergent perspective is a gift, not a hindrance.

If you're seeking a captivating, emotionally resonant experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming, NieR: Automata is a must-play. Its enchanting music, profound storytelling, and soothing gameplay have the power to touch hearts and souls, providing solace and tranquility for individuals like myself on the autism spectrum. Prepare to embark on a journey that will leave an indelible mark on your heart and remind you of the power of empathy, connection, and the beauty of being different.",1685722686,1685722686,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let's start off with the biggest problem: gameplay/combat. The combat and movement are unresponsive. You would expect a combat-focused game to prioritize responsive, smooth, and satisfying combat mechanics. Unfortunately, the combat in Nier: Automata constantly feels like a struggle against the controller. 

The lack of enemy variety is embarrassingly low. If you play the tutorial level, you will have already encountered 90% of the enemies you'll face throughout the entire game. To think that a professional game director would consider having only four common enemies in a 37-hour game acceptable is embarrassing.

The story has been praised as some of the ""best"" that video games can offer, but I am utterly flabbergasted by this claim. Nier: Automata's writing is clich√©, unoriginal, and poorly paced. I fail to understand how anyone can find this story interesting or engaging. While there are some intriguing underlying themes, they do not compensate for the main story's shortcomings. The side characters are generic, and the villains are so cringe-worthy that it makes me ashamed to be a gamer.

If you value your time, I strongly advise against playing this game. It offers three main endings, but two of them have the same conclusion. Personally, I only completed one ending and resorted to looking up the rest of the story online. 

In summary, Nier: Automata is a train wreck of a game. Its abysmal combat, shallow open world, and lackluster narrative make it an absolute chore to endure. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this abomination.",1685643187,1685643187,False,7,0,0.48629993200302124,0,True,False,False

The story is absolutely awesome and one of the most interesting ideas I've seen. You have to play through the game multiple times to get all the details but at least the first three play throughs are different from each other after which you will unlock chapter select and be able to view the other endings more easily.

Combat is smooth and with the way the camera angles move as you explore it gives you several different perspectives which change the way combat feels, even having sections that play like a twin stick space shooter. There are a bunch of different weapons and skills to deck your characters out with and play the way you want to.

The graphics are very nice but a lot of the areas get really foggy and the environments sometimes appear a bit washed out. There are some graphical mods out there but I didn't personally try them so not sure if they help much.

The open world this game features is just that: open, empty, devoid of content. A majority of the gameplay involves you simply sprinting from point-A to point-B, chalked full of unbelievably low effort ""go fetch this for me"" side-quests. Although some of the visuals are nice, the constant level of detail pop-in, broken Ambient Occlusion, and low-res textures in places do a great job in disrupting that experience. The open world in many ways embodies the word ""pathetic"" in its attempt.

The combat that is the highlight of past Platinum Games, and unfortunately it has been watered down to two or three combos max per weapon, with a dodge button that is required to be spammed repeatedly at times breaking the flow of combat. And that's combat at its best! For another 8 hours of the game where you have to play through the EXACT SAME story you just played before, you switch to a different character who's heavy attack has been replaced by an initially novel mini-game (something from Undertale it seems), but quickly becomes a chore with not many differentiations. Although I did enjoy the camera changes during the shoot-em up sections, it's not enough to make up for all the other flaws. In total, a ""pathetic"" attempt at Platinum Games combat.

People who like the game seem to stroke the story the most. I did not find it to be anything special AT ALL. Even if it was good, it wouldn't make up for the 8 hour padding section, mediocre combat, and poor attempt at an open world. I found the two main characters unlikable and inconsistent. And what characters I did enjoy were quietly killed off screen as if to say ""Sorry, you weren't supposed to like that character, idiot."" Since I didn't find any attachment to the main vehicles of the story, I really didn't care much of anything that occurs in the character-driven plot. Sure there are brief moments but they are BRIEF. The existentialism the story is supposed to emphasise is EXTREMELY light. Like, ""What does it mean to be human?"" That's it. Not much is delved into that point and the three main characters have very little to say about the topic. 

Also can we discuss the Final Fantasy XV rejects that are the ""main villains"" in this game? Once again, uninteresting and with an almost embarrassing design. In fact the enemy design throughout most of the game is embarrassing. Aside from a few bosses, EVERY enemy you face is just another version of the rusted out tin-cans you fight throughout the first hour intro of the game. If I play the first hour of a game and I've seen almost all it has to offer enemy variety wise, there's only one word I can describe that as... ""Pathetic"".

I don't completely understand the reverence people hold for this game or the story after playing it. Sure the music is good but like most video games the music loses its charm after the first 2 hours of hearing it repeat continuously. 

I would not suggest anyone purchase this game. The $20 I bought this game for on sale was WAY more than the experience was worth. There are plenty of other games with better combat, better open world, and lack of padding.

BUT the story for me - a persons who hasn't played in other  game in said franchise I think is extremely weak and tried to get emotion out of you with very cheap writing that made little to no sense. Practically every character in this story is an android or machine life form of some kind, but they have human qualities and have robot qualities depending on how convenient it will be for the story. The androids bleed and feel sick in their stomach but when an arm is completely cut off it will only show machinery without any blood or anything that will indicate of it's existence. A lot of the machine lifeforms fight without any thing to say, but a lot of them will say it hurts when ever it gets hit, which I don't think wouldn't be a weird and annoying thing if they gave a little explanation. I have soooooooooo many things that I found didn't make sense and stuff that should have been explained but they let you just stay confused about for as long as possible until you come up with a conclusion that might or might not be actually true.

As of the latest NVIDIA driver update, the game is now unplayable. Complete graphics crash or freezes every few minutes, but the game ""continues as normal"" but your screen has crashed, essentially. 

There is no fix for this. FAR Mod no longer fixes the bugs, since the Nvidia updates have gone beyond what the mod was initially programmed for.

I Love this game to an unbelievable degree, but cannot recommend it until square decides to actually fix this shit.

It's not a Nvidia issue, it's a square issue since release, it's only becoming worse as Nvidia continues to optimize their platform and Square refuses to provide patches to fix the innumerable amount of bugs in the fucking game.

If you want to slog through boring combat, boring quests, boring characters, etc to get to a beautiful meaty plot ending then stop reading this review right here.

I just... can't. I've played for ten hours now and haven't enjoyed a single one. The first thing that strikes you is the graphics. They're awful. I suspect it's intentional and the plot is meant to reveal why eventually because it takes effort to make graphics that bad. The models and textures are straight out of a PS2 game at best, at least for everything except the main characters. All of this is behind some heavy-handed desaturation that at times is reduced all the way to monochrome for some effect.

Then there's all the particle effects. There's a dodge mechanic that requires some timing, but it's often impossible to use just because you can't see anything going on through the obscene quantity of effects flying everywhere.

The quests are boring. Everything I have done so far has felt like filler.

The combat is okay. Okay is really the best I can give it. Maybe if this ""amazing"" story developed faster, or the quests were better, or the visuals weren't actively discouraging me from looking at the game, then the combat would be good enough. As is it is the only thing holding up the game and it's just not enough.

Character customization and build variety seemed promising at first, but then it became clear most weapons share move sets. It's still okay, just... not enough to carry everything else that makes this game difficult to get through.

I really want to believe that the story is worth it if I can just slog through this awful experience to get to it but... ugh.

I'm sure there's worse ones out there but genuinely don't even bother buying this game on PC if you have access to a console. I've played this game on two completely different PC's and have had nothing but problems with this game both times while practically every other game I play runs fine. The game crashes every single time I alt tab out and then bugs out when I try and reopen it and the only solution I've found is to completely restart my computer, verifying files does nothing. I'm sure I'd have enjoyed this game far more if not for all these constant bugs but thanks to all these issues this game has left a pretty sour taste in my mouth, especially considering how insane the hype is for this game.

The game itself is fine when it actually works I guess.. I haven't finished the game yet so I'm not really gonna judge it too harshly but I will say I don't get the hype and I'm pretty far into it, pretty sure I've nearly completed it actually.. The OST is amazing though, definitely my favorite video game OST I've ever heard but that's the only praise I can truly give it atm.

Preliminary scoring I'd give it a solid 5/10 overall, if it weren't for all the horrendous bugs it'd probably be at least an 8/10 though.

The story is a little trippy especially with how the world is and the lifeforms within and how they behave (Trying not to spoil anything). There are multiple endings (26) though some are random fail states or partially silly endings which you might get a few by accident. This game does not have auto save so you must save manually which has caused some inconvenience (Game crashed which only happened once in all my playtime but set me back about 30 minutes). Also the manual save can put you back a little if you encounter one of the fail state endings by accident. Achievement hunters you can't miss anything so fear not and you can enjoy the game at your own pace either way. 

I put this game off for a few years because I was suffering from depression and the vibe of the world in this game wasn't helping (Maybe a warning to others).

Once I installed an extra stick of RAM to run mods with, the game took on fresh life. I try to be fair with critics. Not every game is for everyone.  However, if route B tends to drag on a bit long, just play it through. Routes C/D are not as some say the same as Routes A and B with minor differences. They are the continuation of the game, the consequences of all the mayhem from the first part of the game. 

That said, this game combines combat, story, graphics and music to create an atmosphere unlike any found in most modern games. It's not always a technical powerhouse but it doesn't need to be because the Steam community has shown it a lot of love that makes up for some of the downsides. Honestly, it never needed to be a technical marvel before that. That's not my biased opinion. Several million other gamers seem to like it too.

Side quests are your typical kill/fetch quests, but they help establish what counts as right and wrong 10,000 years from now. Though I've always completed side quests as they appear, it's almost better to save some of them until the end because they'll hit harder with context. It wasn't until my second full playthrough (fresh save endings A-E) that I realized how much the side quests hint at or outright reveal about the game world.

The only major downside I've ever experienced from playing NieR: Automata is that it almost always ruins the games that I play directly afterwards. Anyway, if you're on the fence, stop sleeping on this game. Do the thing. :D",1684791185,1684791185,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The setting is meh and its world is uninteresting since any interesting bits are diluted to homeopathic levels in an ocean of whatever. The sidequests are just dreadfully boring and uninspired. The map is awfully useless with no shortcut button, 3 button presses required and it always resets to max zoom in and if you've read complaints of people about how lame quest markers are and how they make you just go to the marker with no real investment in the quest... this game tries to solve it by placing fake extra quest markers that force you to search more areas and no active quest marker managemen. Hell, you can't even tell which of the quest in your active quests list is the main mission one.

Combat is messy, repetitive and you need to be defensive and feel underpowered all the time. It just falls short in terrible and obvious ways like doing an air-to-ground slam attack with a huge sword you get no invincibility frames or interrupt enemies' attacks. You can literally slam into a bunch of enemies' stupid flailing punches. I just can't believe this game was made by the same studio that did Bayonetta.

It's a pretty game in a PS3 kind of way, with a lot of attention put into its aesthetics but held back mostly by its engine's awful indirect lighting implementation. Sound is alright with good voice acting and tracks of undeniable quality even if not anything I can enjoy.

.....................

This chameleon of an interactive software was made by Platinum Games, so it is safe to say the action portion of this RPG is really darn good. The melee combat is a bit loose and floaty but it's still satisfying enough to play. Healthy amount of weapon selections and movesets, plug-in chips to modify your character stats, support drones and character specific abilities, all of these made available to mix up your gameplay experience. Not to mention the frequent shoot 'em up section, useful for gaining extra exp and is just plain fun.

Character mobility's efficient, functional map and quest tracking. For anyone who's obsessed with ""immersive experience"", there's an in-universe system that allows you to disable almost all on-screen HUD, a very cool function.  

The boss fights, at least the main story ones are generally fine, except for Hegel due to visibility problem, characters' positioning and the camera controls wrestle with each other, making the whole boss fight not intuitive especially to new players.

In short, the game plays great with minimal flaws.

But I suppose everyone's here for the story.
[b] [insert Yoko Taro here] [/b]
[b] POTENTIAL INCOMING SPOILERS [/b]
[b] MIGHT BE BORING SO JUST SCROLL DOWN TO THE END [/b]

With confident I can say that it's definitely a video game story.
It's a highly emotionally driven sci-fi character drama, using the tired ol' question of ""waht is hooman"" and other existentialist ideas seemingly without any interest to re-examine them. What I mean is the sci-fi portion of the narrative is interchangeable, and the so called ""philosophical"" elements in this game are a bit hit-and-miss, not exactly impressive per se. 

I'm not saying it's all bad, because there are fun ideas worth tinkering with here. Animism, memetic intercultural behaviour, literal boxed emotions, these tragic characters' desperation for sustainable purposes for being alive, some of these are all very fun to watch especially through the machine lifeforms' binary way of thinking. Some of these stories succeeded at analogizing how it feels and how it looks like to deviate from the norm. I can empathize with the depressing and troubled thoughts presented in the game, although not entirely. I also agree that some of the stories in this game are fairly disturbing. 
There are moments of levity here and there, which I highly appreciated. The game's not too grimdark, thank god. But yeah, still many rooms for improvements and expansion for them solid story ideas.

Overall, the game has really great moments, surprisingly relaxing open world vibe, a main story that's not exactly impressive but it is engaging enough and presented well enough for it to be entertaining throughout the whole game. 
The desert area is strangely the most memorable area for me.
I kinda love the machine lifeform's designs. They look like toys with interchangeable body parts that I would love to own.
Such a great and unique collection of soundtracks for sure! 

Yeah, I deleted my save file as well.

A solid action game? Here it is.
A great RPG? It's good.
2B? 2B.

It was kinda hard to avoid people talking about how meta this gets even when I've dodged all the story spoilers just because the game's been out for so long. But I still got a lot of surprises out of this game that I wasn't expecting. I won't spoil any of them for you, but I implore you to get this game, play it to its absolute conclusion, and never once consider giving up. If that sounds like a warning that the game's some kind of insanely difficult Souls-like, don't worry. It isn't. It's not that type of game. The gameplay's fantastic, but the story's the selling point. It's gonna force you to persist in a very different way by the end.

As a game, it's a content-rich, insanely gorgeous open world with a stupidly large amount of gameplay variety. By the time you're done with this, you'll feel like you've played like 15 different genres in one game. And it's all very good, or at the very least, kinda funny. One minute it's a hack-and-slash, then a bullet hell, then a fighting game, a platformer, a puzzler, a picture book, a novel, it goes on. I once thought this was an expansion of what Platinum did with Bayonetta in terms of how much variety it lets its players experience on top of the fantastic fast-paced combat, but man, by the end, I realized how much of an understatement that is. And all that's made even better by the game's absolutely amazing soundtrack, which has a dynamic quality to it that I can't quite properly describe, but you're bound to hear several different versions of a track depending on where you are and what situation you're in, and it's a beautiful touch that serves the aforementioned variety on display.

All of this in service to a story and themes that to some folks might either be the deepest shit they've ever experienced, or the most pretentious. But that always seems to be the two extreme responses you get when you have a game that's trying something different. This certainly does a LOT of things different. And I loved it. For as stereotypically anime as the characters can sometimes get (more so in the English dub than the original Japanese, funnily enough), they do feel genuine. And the questions and dilemmas they're faced with are dealt with in such a way that I feel isn't arrogant enough to actually give some concrete answer to the player, but more so is there to make us ponder on them ourselves.

There ARE some things this game won't tell you outright that you probably ought to know though, so I'll quickly list them out:
- Some side quests become either inaccessible or are failed if you haven't finished them by the time you get to certain parts of the main story, so don't rush.
- There's a few of those you'll have a chance to do again.
- Doing most if not all of them nets you a stupid amount of experience, which you'll need so that you're not underleveled by the game's third act.
- If you do end up finishing the game before completing them, there will be a way to complete them all if you're so inclined.

That's it. Apart from that, there's a lot to find, there's a lot to do, and there's some interesting ways that the game handles buffs, upgrades, and weapons that aren't quite like other third person hack-and-slash/beat-em-up games that I've played before.

I promised no spoilers, so I can't say much more than that. What I will say is that if you're in the middle of playing the game and you're starting to think this game's just 2Booty and philosophy references left and right... well yeah, sure, they're there, especially the 2Booty, but the game's way more than that. Shit gets meta. Too meta. In the best way possible. I'm having a hard time trying to sell this game without basically saying everything about it. It's not going to be some exercise in patience, or that there's some convoluted route you gotta take. You really just... gotta keep playing the game to find out. And remember to save often.

This was a beautiful experience.

At writing I'm a decent chunk through the third play-through, and still plan to finish.


While a lot of the core game ideas are sound there are so many huge design issues that it is hard to figure out where to start.


1. There are multiple points in the game where you have a very long (20+ minutes) of tedious unskippable fights that lead to a boss that can easily one-shot you (the most notable being the prologue and when doing the hacking tower(s) in the 9s part of the third playthrough). These are terrible one-shots, they occur even at normal difficulty, there is a ton of time spent getting to the fight, and they are not extremely obvious. If you are having one-shot bosses (particuraly at lower difficulties) they should not have 20+ minutes of tedious set-up

2. One-shots are too prevalent at all difficulties. The reason for this is developers hurting themselves. They made healing WAY too easy and fast; this caused all damage that isn't a one-shot to be trivialized as you can pause immediately heal-up with the very cheap healing items or heal with the many plug-in chips that heal. But the solution is not to just make any fight we want to be hard have rampant one-shots from full (even boosted) health, better to not make such insane healing capabilities in the first place


3. This game has probably the WORST open-world in an otherwise ok game. This game screams linear story and mission based game-play and that is when it is at its best in the moderately choreographed fights in missions and not its barren, boring, and lifeless world. And if you say the point is to see that barren world, I can see it in linear missions too.

4. The games non-boss enemy variation is lame. There are different enemies and they do different things, but they are so lame. They are un-fun, samey, and particularly in the shitty open-world way too easy (except when you get randomly grabbed and one-shot). The one saving grace here is that with some TERRIBLE exceptions as mentioned in point 1, you can just ignore and run past most of them

5.  Another enemy issue is health is way too inconsistent, many enemies and even bosses (at least on normal and hard) will sometimes have way too much or too little health, this is an issue i'll bring up with damage too but the variance is just too high some are total sponges that do trivial damage (especially when as mentioned before healing is very easily accessible) and some are complete glass cannons that die in literally under 4 attacks (this for main bosses that are dead before they even finish their starting dialogue)


There many more complaints I probably don't remember right now (not like anyone will actually get this far/read this), but overall while the game is fine the many major oversights particularly relative to the amount of praise I've heard from this game makes this a clear negative for me even if I finish(ed) it.",1684357872,1684357872,False,8,9,0.49193960428237915,0,True,False,False

Game play combines action oriented combat, RPG leveling mechanics, and bullet hell shooter sections. It sounds like a goofy combination on paper, but this game manages to pull everything together in a really compelling way.

The combat system is fluid and easy to approach, making you quickly feel like a total bad ass as you cleave through hoards of enemies and perform flashy maneuvers like air juggling. Combat isn't shallow though. You have plenty of options to customize your weapons, support programs, and chip load outs to suit your preferred style and challenge your abilities further.

The story is where this game truly shines for me. The plot is interesting, even if it isn't the longest or most in depth of it's kind. It is the kind of story that made me stop and think though. Events stuck with me and occupied my thoughts for days after playing through them. It's so easy to empathize with not only your main playable characters, but a whole host of interesting folks that you meet along the way. I found myself really cheering for so many different people, even when their interests seemed to directly oppose my own.

The soundtrack is beautiful! Especially certain vocal tracks that accompanied dramatic boss fights and big moments in the game. The sound design was solid. I played through the game with Japanese dialogue and the voice acting was on point. I haven't played with the English dialogue, but I would guess they provide similarly compelling performances.

It took me about 65 hours to complete every achievement in the game, but you can get all of the story and the fun challenges done in half of that time.",1684298556,1684298556,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a post-apocalyptic  open world RPG crossed with side scrolling platforming and bullet hell shooter sequences. A formula that may sound off putting at first, but somehow actually works very well. 

STORY: The story is gripping and engaging, with a splash of humor mixed with extremely dark themes. It may not be the greatest story ever told, but it definitely made me stop and think at times due to it's highly philosophical approach. It also knows how to suck the player into the world and makes for some truly nail biting story elements. 

COMBAT: This is where NieR shines in my opinion. The combat system is fast paced and very fluid. At no point did I ever get frustrated with the controls. Everything about combat felt very tight and feels similar to games like Devil May Cry, God of War, and Monster Hunter at their best. Having the ability to quick swap your pods/loadouts and the ease of accessing your heals and buffs made it all the better.

LEVELING: The leveling system is mostly what you would expect. Kill stuff, get xp, level up. The leveling feels similar to a Final Fantasy game, where you don't get any skills points or attributes to spend. However, what sets it apart from other RPG systems is the ability to install new programs or ""chips"" into 2B's hard drive. This is essentially how the skill system works. Find or purchase new programs and install them to your liking. You can re-spec your chips at any time and can have multiple hard drive configurations. You can also spend money to add more memory to her drive to get the most out of the available skills. There is also a system of combining chips to upgrade them. I really enjoyed everything about the chip system. Just don't remove 2B's OS chip. Just... don't.

EXPLORATION: The map is an open world environment, as previously stated, but it's not really THAT big. It's just the right amount of sandbox where it feels alive and robust without trying to be too ambitious. There is a decent amount of running from point A to B due to the large amount of fetch quests, but eventually you will unlock a teleportation system for your fast traveling needs. I suppose the worst aspect of the open world are those typical invisible barriers that exist in many games. It may LOOK like you can double jump and mid-air sprint over that fence, but nah. The game doesn't want you to go that way. I have never cared for that type of restriction in video games and it is just as annoying as ever in this game.

GRAPHICS/AESTHETIC: Now I'm not a graphics nut. I don't get upset about having to lock my game to 30 or 40 FPS and I don't care for all of the graphical nuance that most techies strive for.  After all, I did play this on a Steam Deck. That being said, the game is absolutely gorgeous. Even with mid graphics at 800p, it looked amazing on the handheld. The environments are varied enough and are beautiful to admire. Like I said in the Exploration part, there is a lot of running around in this game. But the stunning detail of the environments, as well as 2B being easy on the eyes, make it a pleasure to endure. I don't want to list all of the different settings since I don't want to spoil anything, but there are some very clever and original parts to the open world map. 

STABILITY: I played the entire game on Steam Deck and after getting the graphics settings right, I experienced zero issues. No stuttering, lagging, crashing, or anything like that. There was the occasional graphical glitch, but overall it felt very polished.

MUSIC: I have been listening to the soundtrack to this game for years before ever playing it. It was recommended to me on youtube and I have loved it ever since. I actually used this soundtrack for Rogue Legacy and Deadcells by muting the game's music and playing this in the background instead. Why would I do this? Because it is a masterpiece. The vocal arrangements (ESPECIALLY during certain boss fights) compliments the highly emotional orchestral music perfectly. Is there a ton of hype around the soundtrack to this game? Yes. Is it well deserved? Absolutely.

REPLAY VALUE: At 28 hours of playtime, I've completed the first ending. You could complete it much more quickly, probably 15 hours or less if you really wanted to, but I let myself get immersed in the world and wanted to do as many quests as I could. And while I plan on taking a break from it for a bit, I am absolutely ready to dive back in and see what is different in my second play through. Now how does that rate in terms of replayability? Well, after finishing the game, I still have a strong desire to jump right back in and start up that opening sequence again. So I would say it's pretty good, but this is honestly a difficult category for me to accurately judge since I've only beat it once.

CONCLUSION: Overall this is an amazing game, very close to a 10/10 experience with some very minor annoyances. I would love to explore more of this world and hope there are more of these games planned for the future. The storytelling, characters, and music all feel very avant-garde and fresh while still maintaining a sense of familiarity.",1684259619,1684259619,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

It isn't really hard to understand that I am absolutely in love with this game when you look at my steam profile.

     NieR: Automata is the second game of the NieR series which itself originates as a spin-off of a certain ending of the first Drakengard game that I unfortunately, didn't play myself. 
All of these games are directed by a (sick) man called Yoko Taro, who basically is responsible for everything that makes NieR: Automata special, from its genre switch to its story; and let me tell you, the story is some good effing sh*t.
    The original synopsis is pretty simple; Aliens created Machine Lifeforms to invade the Earth, to defend itself, mankind sent Androids to fight them and retreated to the Moon. We play as Model 2 class B, 2B, a YoRHa android, fighting against machines of all kind. Through the different endings and well written side quests of the game, you'll learn to appreciate and love an outrageous amount of characters and; assuming you have a functioning heart, you'll love all of the twists the game has to offer.

     But however close to perfection NieR: Automata is, nothing is perfect in the end, there are a few minus points in my opinion that I have to point out;
 - Genre switch: NieR: Automata often switches genre, in fact, the game intro is pretty much a Space Invader game. While it is not ultimately bad, I've seen people get scared by it and even I happened to be pretty mad on a few (rare) occasions when I had to play almost entirely different games for the sake of the story.
 - Map: While most of it is absolutely fine and the areas are pretty enjoyable to look at, accompanied by some of the best OSTs in the entirety of the video game industry, some places are extremely confusing to get at, I'm looking at you, desert. Some quests will ask you to go through some weird passages that you never thought would be possible to go through, I felt like some places were unclear if you could get to it or not and ended up missing things on my first playthrough on PS4.
 - Additional infos are lost between medias: As I said previously, NieR is a spin-off of Drakengard and Automata is the second game of the NieR series, I've see numbers of people be extremely confused at wtf happened before the events of the game and oh how much I'd love to tell you that you JUST have to play NieR: Replicant, but no. For some obscure reasons, a LOT of infos are hidden behind absolutely unrelated stuff, one of the most important characters in the game's story details are hidden behind a, drums rolls, STAGE PLAY, another pretty interesting story that explains quite a lot about the past of YoRHa is also hidden behind another stage play, hell, there's even canon informations in a gacha mobile game. All of this can make searching for new informations a pain, though there's very good videos on YouTube and such.

    NieR: Automata is still my favorite game of all time, I can't explain how much I love it and the NieR series as a whole, it's not just a game, it's a whole experience of life, a masterpiece of art. 
The story is just absolutely amazing, the OSTs, as stated previously, are the bests I've ever heard, with only Persona able to kind of compete with it and I don't even remember any bad side quest (except the racing one, this one shouldn't even exist).

Please, play NieR.",1684199481,1684259112,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But the story isn't some super incredible crazy ascendant thing, it's just fine. Everyone goes on and on about how insane the story and music are, but both are about a 7 or 8 out of 10, honestly. If I were you, I'd wait til a sale brings the price down to really low like I did. I think $20 or less is fair.

Another thing that is misinformation: everyone talks about how you have to beat the game tons of times to get the story. No, you have to beat it once. The game ""ends"" after about 10-15 hours but it's obvious it's not over and they rewind to see the game from a different character, which is not unheard of in games or movies. Also it does not delete your progress, you keep everything as if it was a ""new game+"" automatically. So yes you are seeing the same story but it's different. Then the game continues normally after that. In other words you play through the entire story once. You do not have to play a 50 hour game 3 times, which is how everyone talks about game. It's not true. This rumor alone stopped several people including myself from initially playing the game. It's just one 40-50 hour game, that's it. If you want to see all the endings, much like any other game just make several different save slots and reload and try a different thing. It's not a crazy slog. I have more hours on this game than listed because I tend to leave my games on pause when I go do my chores, so my real time is more like 40ish hours.

Everything from the lore, main story and characters is interesting and really well done, the soundtrack is just beautiful, with some twists to better fit your current situation.
Gameplay wise, the game does a great job too, with enough types of weapons and enemies to keep you from getting bored of slaying everything in your way the same way over and over again. 
Bear in mind that in order to see the ""true ending"" you will need to play three campaigns, totally worth it BTW. The first one with 2B, followed by the same one with a few more cutscenes and explanations, as 9S. The third playthrough is the continuation of the other two, where you get to play with another character (which I won't spoil here).

To finish it, a quick tip to those who decided to try the game: for lore reasons, you can't save your progress during the prologue so if you die you'll need to replay it all, save yourself some time and play it on easy mode (at least the final boss, the other parts do not put much of a challenge) and change back to normal once you are able to save.

It's a game that doesn't feel like it needs to spell everything out for you, or even really make things all that clear, and while I was fine with that, it did make me feel at times like there were things going on in the background of the story that I wasn't fully grasping. Even with that air of mystery, it's very much worth experiencing for yourself, though in retrospect I feel like I should have played Replicant first, given what I know now.

Given its post-apocalyptic setting, the world is wide open and sparsely populated, though I found the level design absolutely gorgeous throughout. There's a central hub area that you'll spend a lot of time in, with several other bespoke areas branching off from it that provide diversity in level design and setting. In those areas in particular, there are numerous points in the game where you'll be working with a fixed camera angle, either from the side or top-down, which can be disorienting at first as you get used to reading the minimap. Combat is basically hack-and-slash, with some customizability coming from your weapon selection and upgrades you can buy, with some bullet hell elements as well, though neither of these went too crazy for someone who generally doesn't enjoy either genre. And, if you're particularly bad at the combat, there are a lot of upgrades that allow you to quickly regenerate health so you don't have to worry so much about not getting hit.

Story-wise, there's a lot to unpack. The core narrative is straightforward for the most part, but the deeper you go, the more twists and turns it takes, and the more it hints at larger themes and goings-on that aren't immediately apparent and are somewhat left to the player to interpret or understand themselves. Vaguely, you'll have to play through the main game what seems to be multiple times, but these ""additional"" playthroughs are necessary for getting the full scope of the story, and you'll know when you've seen the game's true ending when you get there. The story, even with its gimmicky structure, is incredibly engrossing, and strongly endears you to pretty much every major character in the game by the end, though I did feel a little bit like the story was tragedy after tragedy after tragedy, and it fatigued me a little by the time I was done.

Regarding some of those background elements - I played Automata first because people say the gameplay is more polished and it's the easier of the two NieR games to get into if you haven't played them. After playing Automata, though, I feel like if you're interested in the story, it might be better to play Replicant first. It seems like people who have the full picture of the two games invariably recommend Replicant first, and only suggest Automata first if the gameplay is more important to you. I have yet to play Replicant, but there are several side-story beats in Automata that treat it as suggested background knowledge, and obviously the game both came out first and takes place earlier (much, MUCH earlier, for the record), so knowing now that I enjoyed Automata and want more, I kind of wish I'd just played Replicant first, and experienced the two games the way they were released.

Ultimately, Automata is a fantastic game, whether you treat it as a standalone experience or intend to play Replicant with it. Great characters, great story, great gameplay, absolutely worth it, even if it's never on sale. Put it on sale more, Square Enix! Come on!",1684081418,1684081418,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The full comment is here, for those who never played this game before, I guarantee this comment contains nothing that may cause spoiler. So just continue reading at ease.
First, you may wonder where I knew this game and what made me buy it. I know many people are just for 2B (hah). But I'm not. I do that after listened to The Weight of the World (English version) by MONACA, ED of this game by coincidence. That song is pretty good, one of the best I've ever heard. I believe if a game's OST is in high quality, so do this game itself. Then I bought it.
So, this game provides nice and well-designed background music. Although, maybe because its ED is so astonishing, or just because my personal preference (I think Civilization's and Ori's are the best), I have to say the remaining soundtrack is not as amazing as The Weight of the World. But without doubt, its soundtrack is still surely worth a special praise here.
More, the voice of characters, is natural, vivid, and emotional. Pretty nice.
And for characters, their models and animation... What? Don't you know thousands of people buy this game are just for 2B, a character in this game? Maybe that's one of the most successful parts of this game! (laugh)
Graphics quality... Hmm... Not top-level, but still OK.
Finally, game's story... Oh, best in my mind. I think the most valuable part of this game, is its story.
I can even say, it's the story, expressed by video game, maybe the most appropriate medium, make the game, the ""medium"" unforgettable, moving, provoking, and successful.
Originally, I left hundreds of words there, trying to describe something about this. But finally I found that's difficult. This meticulously-designed story just beyond my words.
I couldn't give you more help about the story itself there, except for one thing, if you are those who never play NieR: Automata before:
IF YOU DO WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME, DO NOT BE CURIOUS, NEVER BROWSE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME'S STORY UNTIL YOU COMPLETE THIS GAME WITH ENDING E.
THIS GAME HEAVILY RELIES ON ITS UNIQUE STORY. ANY SPOILER WILL BRING DISASTER TO YOUR GAMING EXPERIENCE.
OK, and then, let's talk about the flaws.
I don't have a controller. It's terrible to play this game with keyboard. You have to use direction keys to adjust the camera. Wait, where's my mouse? Aha, mouse is ""banned"", I've tried to bind two attack keys ('/' and '\') to the mouse but failed. If you stick to control the camera by mouse, your right hand has to move between keyboard and mouse frequently. That's thrilling.
Worse, in some scenes, the camera angle will be locked in an inappropriate position, making the battle or travel weird and uncomfortable.
And I guess many people prefer playing a new game under normal difficulty at first, to get the best gaming experience. It often works well, but for this game, that's not true. I wonder how many new players using keyboard under normal mode can complete the prologue in one go. It's approximately impossible to reach the first checkpoint under normal mode if you don't know how to evade.
Worse, this game doesn't provide a proper tutorial about how to evade.
If you find that's too difficult in your first hour, try to change the difficulty to easy, and turn it back when you reach the first checkpoint. You can change it in settings at any time.
I'm sure the attack animation of characters is cool, but sometimes, the battle itself is tedious.
The map is f**king terrible. It can provide you ""everything"" except your target location. Can't believe people are still using this brainf**king map in 11945 AD. (laugh) That sometimes makes the travel annoying and boring.
So, that's all.
If you want me to give NieR: Automata a score, maybe... 7.5 or 8 /10 ?

It's hard to recommend this game, in the same way that it's hard to recommend Evangelion to someone. You need to have ""[b]that taste[/b]"" for overwhelming sadness, melancholy and helplessness. Try at your own risk.

The game builds up slowly and demands way too much time from the player: the game is linear, it took me some [b]14 hours[/b] to get to the ""good stuff"". At that point, it starts getting better.

The game designers will have the player put up with lots of bull$1t in the name of narrative and creative freedom. Because the progression is quite linear, the player doesn't really have that many options, which, combined with the depressing story, adds to the feeling of inevitability of it all.

Fantastic story
Smooth and satisfying combat
If you are chasing all upgrades for weapons and pods you may or may not have to grind for a small amount but nothing overwhelming

Only complaint is the performance I suppose
Solid 60 FPS with everything maxed
For the love of god don't turn on Anti Aliasing, that sucker makes the game drop to stable 25 FPS in combat...

other than that

NieR:Automata is a heartbreaking experience. It's like watching a magic show, everytime you dwell deeper into the game, a newer sense of awe emerges. It plays with your emotion, provoking contemplation on your sense of purpose in this world. It starts with ""okay this is a cool hack'n'slash"" to ""why do I exist?"". I would give the story itself a B+ (your typical sad, sci-fi Seinen manga plot); but the way the game presents itself through the characters development, playthrough(s), how the story affects your game UI, level design, beautiful soundtrack, and [SPOILERS] meta-game with the game devs and other players: it's just something I've never seen before. I would rank this game as my top 3 story-driven action RPG, maybe the best ever. Don't wait for discount, it will be the most memorable 20-30 hour (50++ if you're a completionist) audio-visual experience in your life.

Pros:
+ Game design
+ Characters arc
+ Soundtrack
+ Voice acting

Cons:
- Average graphics
- Performance (while it's not so bad since 2021 patch, it's apparently limited to 60 fps)
- To understand the lore completely you need to read the novel and watch the anime (playing previous NieR game is not necessary, but it helps)",1683878489,1683878741,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The fact that this game can make you feel such specific feelings and emotions is really impressive and just absolutely incredible. The reviews that say the game doesn't run well are (at least for me) outdated as I got 60 fps or around it most of the time, with maybe the occasional bit of lag. Also, to people that may not be used to this style of genre or game, I get it and I found it to actually be very easy to adjust to considering I don't normally play these kinds of games.
    One of my favorite parts by far about NieR:Automata is the progression. It took me roughly 20 hours to beat, but you can take much more or less time than that. The game is always introducing new content if you are rushing through the story, but you can also discover much of it on your own as well. The game is decently open world-y and that allows you to do a lot of things, including side quests.
    The plot of this game is insane. Sometimes I felt I was so into the game that it was as if reality had escaped, and I was the character I was playing. As if the game had plucked me from my chair and through me into my monitor. There's so many different ways you can play the game as well, with all of the characters, weapons, and other factors, there's a lot you can do in a game that really isn't that big. It's also very emotional.
   The last point I'm going to make here is how much of the game you can personalize. Of course, not everything in this game can be controlled by you, but a surprising amount is. You can play with many different styles using the characters, and of course you can customize how some of them work with the chips, weapons, and all of the different attacks you can do.
    (Summary) NieR:Automata is an incredible game certainly worth the money, even if you don't find yourself interested in this style of game. It's emotional, fun, and a great story which you will (probably) enjoy to the fullest. Also, 2B is incredible. Overall, probably a 9.8/10 game. What a work of art.

One quick edit: I use a laptop with a 10th gen i7, 3050 laptop gpu, and 16 gb ram. I'm just clarifying that because with those specs the game ran well.",1683682407,1683751490,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The voice team also performed absolutely incredibly. Giving an amazing performance all the way through.
All accompanied with absolutely rich music, giving every scene so much weight.
I finally got around to giving this game the time to be 100%'d and it was absolutely worth it.
The game is absolutely rich with lore and secrets in every corner.

the first half (2B's segment) is great.
It introduces you to the world, the characters, and the story starts rolling.

Blah, blah, blah Insert spoilers here.

so you finish this segment, then for whatever reason they thought it'd be a great idea to make you do everything again but as 9S (one of the least likeable characters I've ever come across) 9S also has a completely different play style which in my humble opinion is a pile of shit and explains why he was so useless before.

This feels like nothing short of a waste of fucking time, padding out the game with not only rehashed content, but literally forcing you to play the game again with less enjoyable gameplay in order to experience A2's story.

Then you get to A2's story after a gruelling button mash session that has you use up all of your healing supplies, only to discover that there is absolutely no opportunity to replenish them for some of the hardest battles of the game, even after reaching A2's story.

It honestly feels like such an oversight that I am inclined to suggest that the developers failed to play-test the second half of the game sequentially. It can literally soft-lock you in several areas of the game.

I get the impression that most die-hard fans of this game are weaboos that care for nothing other than drooling at their character's ass, regardless of how repetitive and broken the gameplay is, and those very same people can actually relate to 9S because of how annoying and physically weak he is.

It's honestly so disappointing because the first half of the game felt so unique and flowed so well. Based on my experience of this game, and the claims that NieR: Replicant's gameplay is somehow WORSE, I will not be playing it.

Overall, if it looks interesting to you, get it as cheap as possible, play 2B's story, and then ditch the rest.",1683554004,1683556284,False,5,0,0.447919368743896484,0,True,False,False

The game's combat system is great. It combines hack and slash elements alongside bullet hell mechanics, which keep the gameplay feeling fresh and never really repetitive. It manages to seamlessly incorporate gameplay into the very fabric of its world, somewhat hard to describe if you haven't played the game yourself. This attention to detail ensures that every element of gameplay is integrated with the actual canon of the world for the most part, rooting the player into the world of NieR. This is something that I haven't yet seen done before in a narrative (J)RPG, and I quickly became a fan of the detail woven into the world of NieR Automata.

The open world is breathtaking visually, although it can feel somewhat empty at times. When combined with the game's exceptional soundtrack (one of the best OSTs I've heard) exploring the world is very captivating and relaxing. Even the side quests, while simple, are meaningful, and provide context to the game's lore and usually have fun interactions between the multitude of characters and the main cast.

One thing that seriously sets NieR Automata apart from other RPGs I've played before is the deep philosophical themes it explores. Concepts such as existentialism, nihilism, and general philosophy are interwoven into the game's story and are thought provoking, they give the players the freedom to interpret the story and meaning behind it in their own way which in my experience is uncommon in games. The themes impacted me deeply, leaving me with much to ponder long after I finished playing.

The story itself is also captivating, and I was eager to keep playing to find out what happened next. The final ending of the game was particularly powerful and emotional, leaving me in tears during the credits - The first game that has ever made me cry.

After playing NieR Replicant, I have an even greater appreciation for NieR Automata, as the events that take place in the former add another layer of meaning to the latter. So if anything I've said about the game seems remotely appealing to you, I encourage you to give it a try, because I was unsure if this was the game for me. 

Thank you, Yoko Taro, for creating such an exceptional game.",1683403736,1683403736,True,1,0,0.53125,0,True,False,False

524220,137873591,76561198030214471,0,4,443,0,443,1683366336,So i bought this game years ago played a few hours and forgot about it because my laptop back then could barely run it. Now that i have better PC i remembered this game and wanted to give it another try but it was just awful experience. Camera is static speed so even if you drag mouse fast it will still turn around at the same speed. If you customize speed in settings it's either fast or slow since the camera is essentially what you get with an analog stick on a controller. Dodging is double tap of direction key and you can't set a key for dodging. This personally just feels super bad and dodging didn't register like half of the time i double tapped(in games with designated dodge key like Dark Souls or Nioh i have no problem dodging). Another thing is some enemies can essentially stun lock you in their combo such as the excavators in the initial intro map and when i got to fight 2 of them on a bridge they stun lock me with a single attack because dodging didn't register and i died which makes the game just play ending credits saying you failed to save the planet or whatever and you're done and you have to start a new savefile and replay whole intro map from the beginning through all the autoscrolling sequences which i just didn't feel like doing again. Even if the game story might be good as people say i didn't get to experience it simply because of the awful controls which make me just not want to bother with the game. With a controller i assume the experience would be better but with keyboard and mouse personally it just feels super clunky,1683367471,1683367471,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Had trouble figuring it out at first, ended up doing just fine later, but I'd still recommend to those deep enough in the reviews here who haven't already played to play it with a controller instead of a keyboard, because there's certain actions (like dodging) that don't have a dedicated button on keyboard, and require you to double-tap a WASD key, so playing on keyboard will make late-game combat (especially with the DLCs) harder. 

As for the story, it has to be experienced blind. It just has to, to give you the full effect. As of this review I have not played the original NieR or its Replicant remake, but I probably will at some point in the future just to get the fully complete picture (not required to understand the story, but there's certain details that I imagine will be clearer with them in mind). 

It feels really good to have played a game that elicited such powerful reactions in me (not those ones, at least not solely) after thinking I'd become desensitized to certain tropes and such in games. Big mcthankies from mcspankies to the madman who rolled around on the floor to advertise T-shirts, as well as the army of programmers, artists, musicians, and other individuals who worked to create this inspiring and devastating work.

You have to give the VA of 9S kudos for doing an excellent job! His emotions speak well to the audience, like me.

Could you give this title a go and finish it? That's all I have to say for this review.

Didn't like it at first but then i gave it another chance thinking nothing would change really but boi was i wrong the different endings the combat system the plug in chips it's all beautifully synced up to one another. The boss battles the unique enemy types GOD this game is good.

10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for JRPG.

I'm going to be honest, I was really torn on whether to recommend this game or not, for a few reasons. However, I found that after getting to the final credit scene, the good does outweigh the bad, but not by much.

The graphics aren't incredible, but the art-style is great. The areas, enemy and character design are all topnotch and unique. The combat is fun with lots of varying styles added to the mix to keep things fresh. The story and its message are great, but it did lose me a bunch of times, which I'll get on to a bit later. The RPG system is great, being able to unlock, upgrade and install different chips to upgrade your character was a really inventive way to work the upgrade system. Of course, there's levelling too. The voice acting is great (played in English), there wasn't a point where any of the lines fell flat, was really well executed. Finally, the best part though, is the music, damn, the soundtrack really slaps! Some of the best video game music I've heard in a long time, super stylised which I loved. All of these combined make for a great experience from start to finish.

However, this game does have some really glaring flaws, which were more design choices, but they really didn't gel with me at all. First of all, which I think is its biggest blunder, is having to play through the first section of the game again, to get to the part that is actually really good. Personally, I felt the first section of the game was really bland, so having to play to again to get to the good stuff was an absolute chore and I can see why many players stop at this point. People argue that it makes the scenes later on hit harder, but I really disagree, if anything, the frustration from having to play the first section again really takes away your flow and interest in the story as you feel its not respecting your time.

Next, the design choice not to implement auto-save. I know this may seem small, but in a game with such a heavy story and difficult combat, having to replay story sections because you died 20 minutes after a save point was available really takes away from the impact of those sections you have to play again. As you'll be playing through them again, frustrated and disinterested, rather than engaged.

Finally, the game doesn't scale with you if you're underleveled. This is particularly annoying when the game is hard enough as it is, but the side-quests to get yourself leveled are countless boring fetch quests or you just need to start grinding enemies. There were many times I had to swap to Easy (stupid, I know) so I could get past a poorly designed boss fight (screw you in particular Hegel!) to progress the story, again reducing your engagement.

These three major issues alone really hampered my experience with this game, however, only having three is an achievement on its own. 

For anyone playing the game for the first time, do all of the side-quests on the first section of the game, you will be thankful you did. Level your chosen weapon as soon as you can and make sure to use the EXP boost chip whenever you can. Also, don't expect just a hack and slash, there is a lot more variety in combat and gameplay than that. Finally, yes, the second playthrough of the first section of the game sucks, but the people posting online aren't lying, it is really worth it getting to the final part of the game.

524220,137620269,76561198321242551,55,4,55,0,55,1682933444,"Hey dear internet. May I ask you a question. What is the answer to the equation of ''A Tarantino wannabe director + a shitty game developer that hasn't developed in ten years + a brain dead community that didn't play the game because of looking at the character's bum'' ? Yep. I just don't get you people. Terrible level and mission design, ok story but you literally have to play it twice to ''understand'' it, not only game has just a single type of enemy but also insufficient gameplay. And some of you retards say ''If Kojima had his name on this game, it would be considered to be the best game ever.'' Yeah bro sure why not XD. A linear game that only has basic mechanics of Bayonetta to be the best game (and its not even improving as the game progress. Oh it also has some kind of bullet hell shit and 2D kind of stuff that coming out of nowhere every fucking 5 mins. Instead of make the game interesting and fun to play, it irritates me. In addition, game also has some kind of ''Philosophy'' that is in the level of Socrates XD. Dont get me wrong i am into that shit. I could cry and ended up just staring to ceiling and question my existence. I did at some point in my life to be honest. But in a game this level of shitness, then trying to be SOMA, Silent Hill 2 or Spec Ops: The Line, its just ridicilous. Game cant even decide whether to leave breadcrumbs for you or just tell the straight fuck up to your face what the fuck its about. Being clich√©, doesnt mean good or bad. But if you played or watched or read thing and you are not 10 years old, you'd guess every step on this game. The game gives us facts, we accept them as true, and then game subverts them as if they are a reveal, when in reality we already knew that and now we're just confused.By the time we get to the desert, we are fighting robots who are going ''I am scared!'' and ''Go away! Please!'' and as we kill them 9S goes '' Do you think they understand concept of being scared?'' and also points that they wear clothes. Then they also see they having ''sex'' and one of them rocking a baby. Later on, our lovely characters discuss it: ''Hey 2B, why do these machines do this thing or do that'' boo hoo and etcetera, 2B will go ''Emotions are forbidden'' like every fucking shitty dandere or kuudere character. Like i said, if you are not 10 years old you would say ''Is this game seriously going to drag this 'what does it mean to be alive' plot-point out for whole game?'' Spoiler alert.. yep. PC port is awful, too. I literally had to download a mod to fix these fucked up controls. Soundtrack is actually one of few thing that this game do. And thats it. It has been in my mind to play this game since the entire internet full of 2B fan made things and many games that  had nier stuff in it. Not even mentioning nier fans. I expected this game to be something like my second Ori but ended up to be an ubisoft game. My disappointment is immeasurable about this game. My advice to PlatinumGames, just stay in Bayonetta. But looking back to Bayonetta 3, maybe dont do that too. And other advice to Toko Yaro, quit directing, you are not cool or mysterious. You are just a creep that is eager to make us stare, based on cutscenes, right up to sexy women's skirts. Its so grisly everyone is fine with that. Remember when i said ''brain dead community'' yep thats it. This weird voyeurism sits around 2B like an audience of jeering men, some kind of feeling. I usually dont mind this kind of stuff, in fact i have a porn game in my main account, but this is too much. I have never felt this wtih any other gaming character. I do appreciate that characters can be eye candy and i do encourage it. And I am not sjw or any kind of thing but there is someting so intrinsically creepy about how the game constantly frames 2B. Everything about 2B is just the Thermian Argument incarnate, really. for example, using ''Self Destruct'' option causes a huge AOE explosion, which can be useful, but more serves as a way to remove 2B's skirt. But when you ''Self Destruct'' 9S, he'll still wear shorts. Why? Or as you are walking around the world, the camera always puls itself slowly back and points upwards slightly, angling from below up into her skirt, so you can see constant slips of her ass. i feel like it's sat next to me throughout my entire playthrogh, a hand on my shoulder and a creepy voice in my ear going ''Hey lets look up her skirt, shall we'' zzz. She has been so explicitly designed for the activation of neurons in monkey brains. I dont know dude. I just hate everything about this game and it drives me to constant hatred of humanity and awakens deep racisim within me.

And also, 2B is a fucking pedophile.",1682951844,1682951844,False,1,2,0.355285555124282837,0,True,False,False

The game itself, is actually pretty fun and enjoyable....when it works. But getting it to work is a pain. Every single time I load the game it resets ALL settings to the default values. Which is a huge problem because you have to change a lot of settings to get the game to work properly, Every time I boot up the game I have to spend 15 minutes navigating the multiple options screen to get everything back to the settings I wanted.

The biggest issue of these is the resolution. For whatever reason I cannot comprehend, the game be default will load the LOWEST resolution possible on launch, which is SO BAD that you can't even read the text on the menus to change it. I had to find a Youtube video of someone else's playthrough, where they go into the options screen, so I could discern what buttons to press to make my resolution something readable, And I had to memorize this sequence of button presses because the settings reset EVERY SINGLE TIME.

If you google ""Nier settings reset"" you'll find that this is a common problem with the game, You'll also find multiple ""workarounds"" posted around the web, none of which have worked for me. How such a well known problem has gone unaddressed is beyond me. Despite showing 140 played at the time of this review, I am sad to say that I am not even 1/3rd of the way through the game, as much of my time has been spent trying to resolve these technical issues, and constantly redoing my settings, rather than enjoying the game.",1682831478,1682831478,False,1,0,0.494382023811340332,0,True,False,False

**Spoiler free**

+ Combat system is easy to learn, somewhat difficult to master
+ Fun hacking minigame
+ Great voice acting
+ Incredible soundtrack
+ Interesting story
+ Great variation of RPG and Arcade(ish) gameplay
+ Lots of upgrades, collectibles, and side quests
+ A set of difficulties ranging from anything to a casual playthrough to a complete hardcore nightmare
+ Great visuals, so take lots of pictures with F12
+ Loads of endings, with the ""main endings"" all being obtainable without having to do any questionable side content. Just play through the game, and get the regular endings. Then go back and attempt to get all the optional endings. You aren't going to miss anything



- Hacking minigame gets mildly redundant at times due to how much it's required at certain points in the game.

I've been playing this slog of a game for three years, completing first ending playthrough on normal difficulty in 24 hours, plus 47% of insufferable boredom of side quests, and two hours of second main characters ""perspective"".
  By playing a lot of different games throughout many years you start to see patterns and reasons why game design was made this particular way. Even in bad games you start to enjoy certain positive and well made parts, and excuse developers for mistakes or blemishes when there are clearly an effort and passion put into it, providing at least unique and new experiences to a player.
  There are a lot of bad games,  unfinished games, or frustrating games, and we can like and dislike them for different reasons. This game suffers from most devastating characteristic - bland boredom... which accumulated with a sense of wasting time. That's why I cannot excuse it in anyway. Oh, and a huge disappointment, since it was hyped up by everyone and everywhere.
   Deep and sophisticated story, as claimed by fans, is a shallow joke and cheap melodrama with good voice acting, I even watched some lore videos and footage of other endings to be sure that I am not missing any ""deep meanings"" of this plot. Let me tell you, most ""human"" story stuff & somewhat interesting character development is in the novels or other extra content BUT NOT IN THE GAME!!!
   Gameplay hooks you at first with variety of combat and animation but gradually becomes two button mashing attack and dodging left or right by looking at enemies flashing red eyes, in visual epileptic cacophony of explosions where you see nothing. I spent substantial amount of time to unlock all skills and plug in chips configuration builds, it's there but you will opt for most optimized combat build 90% of time anyway since enemies are almost the same (except centipedes and kamikaze drones) AND you wouldn't switch to it often anyway because you cannot do it during combat, PLUS there are like FOUR stages of extremely slowly animated submenus to get through... 
   World building and locations (apart from Amusement park) are so simple, empty and generic, side quests barely provide any context, everything is detached from each other providing no interesting mysteries or narrative or visual storytelling.
   The beloved by fans core idea of this narrative driven RPG is well known topic which was discussed many times and presented way better in classics, or other better contemporary media. Damn even popcorn adaptation of Azimovs books, ""I robot"" movie was better than this.
   The only good things are music, some bosses, and animation choreography for combat. The rest is just suffering of an experience, especially quantity of UI submenues, occasional camera movement and pc port....",1682430109,1682517641,False,2,1,0.469964683055877686,0,True,False,False

Bought this game almost 2 years ago cause it was on sale and it looked cool and now I finally got to reaching the [E]nd.

The music hits hard from the very beginning; and it fits the location you're in or the activity you're doing like a glove. The game is masterful with the audio, the visuals, the mechanics, and finally, the plot. 

The only way I can describe the experiencing the story is that it's like watching a flower with a myriad petals bloom in an accelerating time lapse: you do not know how long it'll take, you do not know how much faster it can go but the only thing that you do know is that it's a beautiful sight to behold. I don't think I'm capable of elaborating on that without spoiling something because every part of this story, every emotion it evokes, needs to be experienced first hand.

Having played this, I'm raring to try the other games from Yako Taro and of course, watch the anime as I've heard that it offers yet another perspective to the events that unfold within the game.

If you like solo RPG games and can afford it, I wholeheartedly recommend playing this [i] masterpiece [/i] of a game.",1682374211,1682374351,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The writing, music, story, characters, combat and design are all great, but the world exploration and progression are.. infuriating. The zones have a lot of areas that look like you should be able to get to/through them, but there are invisible walls EVERYWHERE. What look like doorways and hallways are almost always blocked off. The fact that there's any platforming in this game is confusing because there are VERY few places where you actually can jump to get a chest or traverse zones. As far as my issues with progression goes, I often found myself just aimlessly wandering around trying to figure out where exactly I was supposed to go to move the story forward. Luckily each ending is only a few hours away from the last, at the worst, but it took me about twice as long to get anything done than people without ADHD.

As a whole package, the game is fun. The characters are interesting enough, the voice acting feels coherent and is produced well, too. I also think the random little interactions you stumble upon are charming as hell and promote exploration, but like I said, that aspect is frustrating. I WANT to explore, but there aren't many signs in the world to differentiate where you can and can't go. To put it simply, how you move through the world looks like a PS4 game, but FEELS like a PSP game. What made me stick around was the writing, art/design and the music; the music is REALLY fun! It reminds me of Kingdom Hearts in a lot of places, but also has some more Pokemon-esque bits, both of which have very well produced scores. I plan to play more of this game in the near future. 

Oh, side-note: I found a build that essentially makes me invincible very early on, so the combat was a bit lost on me. It was just hold RB and mash X while running in a circle, while kills, damage and time all heal me. If I DID get hit, I had another plug-in/chip that made me use a healing item automatically. The only time I died was on one of the compactors on the assembly line that kills you instantly.",1682361590,1682361590,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With that being said, this game is fucking amazing, and one that you CANNOT understand or get the most out of until you get the E ending after three playthroughs and change where you are left with the hardest choice you will probably make as a gamer. Sci Fi elements are a backdrop to a massive amount of existentialism about what anything even means anymore. All set to a soundtrack that is an infinite well of pure FIRE for any situation you are in

Combat arguably for an action JRPG is nothing special, its a pretty basic hack and slash mechanics wise, but there's plenty there to make combat encounters exciting (well, beyond the fact that you will be punished beyond repair for just blind rushing into combat without the right upgrades and tactics, or in some cases, not even wanting to fight to begin with :) ). Combat is mainly a good backdrop for this insane story. My biggest complaint about combat is moreso when you start route B and your heavy attacks are replaced by hacking that takes you out of the moment to play Cyberspace Enter the Gungeon over and over. Also, gold enemies are an absolute warcrime

This is an absolute must play game even though it rarely, if ever, goes on sale. Very much worth its price

Some other quality of life mods are recommended too - look up the definitive mod guide on Nexus.

Second urgent advice: do not stop playing once you see the end titles for the first time, this is only about half of the story. It's more than worth it to continue until you've obtained endings A-E; it's not just other perspectives later on, it's also literally a continuation of the story.

-------------------------------

On one hand, NieR:Automata really deserves a 9/10, but on the other it deserves at most a 7/10. In the end, I'm giving it an 8/10, and below I'll explain why.

It deserves a 9/10 because in many ways it's an utterly brilliant game. The concept of the world is fascinating, the few main characters are very authentic, and the story (once you get to the >actual< end!) is so powerful that it left me emotional for days. The world design is charming and memorable, despite sub-par graphics in the vanilla version, voice acting is amazing (the Japanese voice-over is hugely recommended), and the soundtrack is otherworldly - even though there aren't too many tracks there, they're SO GOOOD that I didn't want to stop playing the game just because of the music. Combat is fun and well-balanced too, with a satisfying progression curve. Maybe the strongest suit though is that the game is original and surprising in so many ways. I won't give examples here because it's amazing and you have to see it for yourself! But let's just say that there are at least 6 different modes of gameplay, with virtually seamless transitions.

And then we get to the second part - why it deserves a 7/10 at most. It's really down to the fact that I felt compelled to give two pieces of advice at the beginning of the review - part of it is due to it being a terrible port, and part due to questionable design decisions. The game is literally unplayable on mouse & keyboard, which is just unacceptable. Some examples: negative mouse acceleration in 3rd person mode (the faster you move the mouse the slower the camera movement), and broken aiming in side-scrolling mode (mouse movements cause the crosshairs to jump up or down, but it jumps back to horizontal after each increment). Luckily modders sorted this out (in say 98% - there are still minor issues at some stages).

And by far the most questionable design decision in my view is the decision to split the game into three playthroughs, forcing the player to essentially replay the game with only minor changes and additions after ""finishing"" the story, in order to get to the actual second part of it, which let's just say is CRUCIAL. Even though at the end of the first playthrough the game tells you ""please continue"" I wasn't sure if I wanted to or if it was worth it - I looked online and saw some people saying it was worth it, so I did, but also saw plenty of people saying they gave up because of the repetitiveness, which is SUCH A SHAME. After playing through the whole thing and thinking and reading about it a lot, I remain unconvinced that this was necessary - I think the different perspectives and elements of the second playthrough could be integrated into the first, just like different perspectives were integrated at the beginning of the 3rd playthrough. It would avoid alienating many players, and make for a more cohesive and less grindy experience.

After all the experience was so amazing that I couldn't give less than an 8, but I wish I could give more.",1682165282,1682165282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The final ending, though? Brings it all together. I considered putting the game down several times, but was told to keep going until ending E. And here I am, recommending you do the same. It ended up being the most satisfying ending in any game I've played. If you start playing it, keep playing until ending E. It changes the entire game. Honestly, I didn't like the GAME itself all that much, but it still managed to blow my mind. 

There are many games that are art, but Nier manages to leverage the game medium's unique capability for interaction and delivers its art in a way that no other medium could.",1682116387,1682116387,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lovely music, beautiful world design, interesting setting/story. Combat can be fun. Yet...

There is an inherent problem with balancing a games difficulty around the use of instant heal potions, especially when they are so plentiful. Normal difficulty is an absolute joke. One of the easiest games you could ever play. A boss might hit you for 20% of your health, but you have 297 healing potions...

Which brings us to difficulty settings. Normal is a joke, but hard mode is an even bigger joke. Hard difficulty just means 90% of everything will one-shot you. An attack that dealt 20% damage before, will now kill you. I don't even want to imagine very hard difficulty. The only way it could be harder is if they made it so you die in real life.

This itself is made more annoying by the fact that you don't always respawn in or anywhere near the boss room. Once I had to run through a cave, wait in an elevator, run through a city, watch 3 cinematics/unskippable dialogue to get back to the point I was at in the boss fight.

And for those of you who like to explore the world, find secrets and the like. The game has a lot of that, but is somewhat held back by the endless amount of invisible walls everywhere.",1681915867,1681915867,False,5,1,0.503246784210205078,0,True,False,False

you dont get hypped with history, quests, combat, or gameplay. 

After some point the game gets very boring and u think something is missing and you dont know why u playing, and its became not good, tiring

maybe the only good thing is that u can see 2b ass every time u walk though the map, and u walk a lot, so this game is a 2b ass simulator.

History: 5  its a 25h game that u need to play again more 4 times to see all endings, lame

Truly a different experience in every corner. You will simply not get bored in this game because it combines so many genres with beautiful graphics and a very deep lore that keeps you hooked.

I recommend everyone to keep playing after finishing route a. Even though playing route b may seem repetitive, you can quickly focus on main missions and get to where things actually get dark and exciting which is route c. Definitely worth the time and effort you put in this game.

Now it's a very good hack and slash game, and its mechanics feel very nice.

But they're nice, and ever since the beginning the game tells you it's not just one genre. It's a top-down and side scroller shooter as well.

The story is a tragic tale of androids. I don't want to spoil anything because it's THAT GOOD, but it's amazing. Quite the psychological trip. Won't go further into it, but they're androids fighting for the humans, trying to eradicate Earth of alien robots so they can once again live there.

The game tells the story of androids 2B, 9S, and A2 as they fight to reclaim a post-apocalyptic world overrun by machines.

One of the most notable aspects of ""Nier: Automata"" is its seamless blending of multiple genres, from hack-and-slash combat to bullet-hell shoot 'em up sequences. The game's combat is incredibly fluid and satisfying, with a variety of weapons and abilities at the player's disposal. Additionally, the game's open-world structure allows for plenty of exploration and discovery.

But where ""Nier: Automata"" truly shines is in its narrative and characters. The game's story is a poignant meditation on the nature of humanity, consciousness, and free will, with unexpected twists and turns that keep the player engaged from beginning to end. The characters are equally well-crafted, with each android possessing a distinct personality and backstory that adds depth to the game's overarching themes.

The game's presentation is also noteworthy, with gorgeous graphics and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack composed by Keiichi Okabe. The game's visuals range from bleak, post-apocalyptic landscapes to neon-drenched cities, all of which are rendered with breathtaking detail.

Overall, ""Nier: Automata"" is an exceptional game that manages to combine gameplay, storytelling, and presentation in a way that few other games have achieved. Its themes and characters will stay with players long after the credits roll, making it a standout title in the modern gaming landscape.",1681748429,1681748429,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

About the optimization, I would say now it is acceptable; back in 2017, when I stated it was buggy. but now you will have an unforgettable experience. The New Nier Automata anime has also been released. I strongly suggest to avoid watching it if you want to play the game first, but it is also on the verge of being a masterpiece.

The soundtrack is one of the best I have heard, I could listen to it for days. The combat is smooth. The art is beautiful. 2B and A2 are best girls. Story is good, some side quests are simply heart-breaking. (I am so sorry, Pascal.)

Some of the things i felt surprising was animal riding, I did not think I would be so glad about being able to ride a moose in a game doing quests. But I really enjoyed that. And 2B riding a boar looked hilarious. And also another thing that i found surprising was the water physics. The clothes get wet when you go into water. I did not expect that, it was so trivial, but felt so good. And Thank you Yoko Taro for letting me buy Achievements in game. I truly do not have the heart to go through some of the evil endings. Especially after knowing what Pascal have went through.

I felt like the few things that could improve was the boss fights. Could be a tad more difficult. And perhaps Day-Night system? Even characters in game questions the existence of nights. (I find that hilarious though).

2. In order to experience the story in its entirety DO NOT STOP AFTER THE FIRST ENDING! The story isn't finished until you reach at least the 3rd ending (not including any of the 21 joke endings you can get along the way), and even then I highly recommend doing the 4th and 5th endings as well which just require repeating the final fight of the 3rd end through the chapter select that gets unlocked afterwards.

I made a point of playing Nier Replicant before Automata and, while it took a long time for me to warm up to Automata by comparison, I think this game shines brightest when looking back on it after finishing it. Admittedly the combat in Automata, while complex and good, is not a kind of combat I particularly enjoy, and combined with my confusion regarding the story based on prior knowledge from Replicant I really didn't understand the hype surrounding Automata for quite a while. Trust me when I say that it pays off. The 3rd playthrough had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish and the 5th ending is quite possibly the most moving moment I've felt in gaming, and on paper it doesn't even feel like it should be but in the moment it just pulls you in so masterfully. I'm still not sure which is my favorite between Replicant's charm and impact or Automata's big picture story but between the 2 of them this series is competing with Dark Souls to be my favorite ever, and I think it's winning.",1681267128,1681267128,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons:Mostly Repetitive and boring Boss fights (Some boss fights are quite but the good  good ones are minority) , as good as some side quests story may are some side quests are really boring, open world is not filled and it is empty and the quest design is not so good.

If you are an experienced player of games with good story  or you had your taste of combat hack n slash focused games this game may not appeal to you but if you are only starting to get into games (and maybe if you like animes a little bit) I absolutely recommend this game.You are most likely going to leave with good memories

Was really let down after hearing so many good things about it.
Combat is not bad but, it's a hack and slasher that has been done better by many other titles.
The story feels as though the writer picked up an introductory books on philosophy and had the idea that they must make a game about it.
Small map with quickly boring locales that you'll have to traverse at least twice if you've looking for a ""full experience"".
While the melee combat is decent, the parts where you have to hack or fly the flight suit are infuriatingly unenjoyable.

Keep in mind that [b]this game is not for everyone[/b]. [u]Do not listen to the fanbase[/u]; [b]In my opinion[/b], the game is just a great excuse to tell a [b]very good and intricate story[/b].

I will try to avoid typing a wall-text, although it will be hard. Also [b]the review is spoiler-free[/b].

[h1]Setting Up[/h1]
You can [b]enhance your game experience[/b] by using the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1156086818][b]HD Texture Pack Mod[/b][/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=914437196][b]Special K[/b][/url]. Also, this is a very personal preference but, [b][u]YOU MUST CHANGE[/u][/b] the voices to [b]Japanese[/b]. Trust me, [b]it is a huge upgrade[/b] (unless you hate Japanese).

[h1]Story[/h1]
The game is set in the [b]year 11945[/b], where the [b]humanity has abandoned Earth and fled to the Moon[/b] after it was [b]invaded by aliens using a powerful machine-lifeforms as weapons[/b]. To reclaim our planet and fight against the machines, the [b]Council of Humanity[/b] creates [b]YoRHa[/b], an elite military force of androids.

[b]NieR:Automata‚Ñ¢[/b] has [b]one of the best stories[/b] that I have ever seen, blending [b]sci-fi[/b] with [b]existential philosophy[/b] to create a thought-provoking narrative. [b]It is totally worth playing just for that[/b]. However, I must admit that at beginning [b]I had to force myself to play[/b] because [b]the game didn't hook me at all[/b]. After reaching a certain point of the story,[b] I just couldn't stop playing[/b].

Most people will tell you that you must [b]finish the game multiple times[/b] in order to enjoy it. [b]Well, that's not true[/b]. A [b]single playthrough is enough[/b], just [b]aim to reach lvl +50[/b] while naturally playing.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game is set in an [b]open world full of secrets, enemies, resources and quest[/b]. The side-quest  [b]are a little bit repetitive and lacking in variety[/b], also [b]completing some of them[/b] may [b]require a lot of [u]backtracking[/u] at the beginning of the game[/b], which can be a pain. Fortunately, at some point [b]you will unlock teleports which make it much easier[/b] to get around and complete quests.

You can [b]customize your character[/b] with unique [b]weapons[/b], [b]plug-in chips[/b] and [b]special pod skills[/b].

The combat system is a [b]great mix[/b] between [b]hack-and-slash[/b] and [b]bullet hell[/b] games. However, [b]once you have a consistent weapon and plug-in chip loadout[/b], it becomes [b]extremely easy[/b] [i](in my case, I was one-shotting everything, [b]even bosses![/b] that's why I said that the game feels like an excuse to tell a story)[/i].

Just take note that [b]many people complain that the game's scenarios are poor and empty[/b]. But let's be realistic:[b] We are in a dystopian world with a well-crafted and well-told storyline, so it makes sense for the world to be like that[/b]. Perhaps they were expecting to play a different type of game, such as a [b]musou game[/b] ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

[h1]DLC[/h1]
[b]The DLC is a great and fun addition that is totally worth playing[/b]. 
It unlocks [b]three different colosseums[/b] (each one with its own rules) that will test your strength.

As you complete the different levels, [b]you will unlock special skins and items[/b]. Also, if you manage to complete the higher difficulties, you will unlock [b]an extra ending[/b].

If you are wondering about the DLC name [b]3C3C1D119440927[/b] it means:
‚ü° [b]3 C[/b]ostumes
‚ü° [b]3 C[/b]olosseums
‚ü° [b]1 D[/b]ream
‚ü° A date: [b]11944[/b]-[b]09[/b]-[b]27[/b] (you must figure out ingame what this date means, just remember that the game starts at 11945-03-10)

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

* Needs a few mods to fix some underlying bugs wrt rendering
* The combat is pretty average, towards the end it was a spam-fest against sponges
* Visually it's poor, the characters are ok, but the environments are terrible for example
* Gets a bit grindy at times. For example, one of the first quests required me to reload a few times as the enemies didn't drop an item I needed
* You have to play the game multiple times to get the ""full experience"", there are some minor changes, but the first two are largely the same
* The story was highly philosophical and tended to rely on not explaining things, leaving the player to ponder the meaning of life. There's also a whole bunch of stuff that seems to be crammed into it from previous titles which are never explained

Buy it and enjoy one of the best games ever made



[h3]Story[/h3]
I may have spent 40 hours in the game.
But I spent easily double that on YouTube diving into the full Drakenguard and NieR storyline.

Yoko Taro is a fucking madman genius and this game series is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
There will likely never be another game series like this because a game like this only works once.

And boy did it work.
Do yourself a favor and play Replicant first and then Automata,
then catch up with Drakenguard, extended media, and put everything into perspective by watching this:
https://youtu.be/9WU1mvH6bqo
[spoiler]Yes, it's 6 hours. Yes, you will watch it. I won't even have to ask[/spoiler]

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
Gameplay wise this game is even more fantastic,
Platinum games rolled up every game they made in here.
You got a twin-stick shooter, you have an amazing action combat system with multi-weapon combos and some of the best animations in the business, you got one of the most interesting mod systems in any game. Every gameplay aspect is even grounded in lore.

[h3]Music[/h3]
THEY MADE A WHOLE NONSENSE LANGUAGE FOR THIS AND IT SOUNDS GOD TIER

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
In the end, no words will be enough to praise this game. It is the definitive video game to ever exist.

And, if that is what the creator - Yoko Taro - intended, then it did its job well, and is a really good game. I'm happy and thankful that I spent those 60 hours on it. 
(Written at the time of an emotional height after achieving ending E.)

Edit: Totally forgot about a few things. First: gorgeous soundtrack by Keiichi Okabe, which haunts my music playlist for already two months now, and it's really well mixed, appearing almost as if dynamic (maybe it is dynamic, and I'm just setting the bar too high). Second: awesome collabs with FFXIV and Punishing: Gray Raven (the reason why I even picked up the game). I have no idea if Taro himself was involved in them, or it's just fromsoft being greedy and realizing the potential profit from a collab, but I really liked those (oh and also there were Soulcalibur 6 and FFXV ones I guess). Third: I would really like to thank Yoko Taro for this game, as his creativity inspired me to actually continue some stuff of my own, and showed me that sometimes following rules, genres, or a readers' critique too harsh to be called a critique, would just ruin the work, and authors ought to follow one's heart a tad more often.

Combat 10/10
Story 10/10
Art 10/10
Music 100/10

I played this day one back when it came out on PS4. I instantly was hooked from the very beginning sequence. I am going to keep this brief. The music is some of the best in the industry. The soundtracks themselves are masterpieces. This is the only game I have actively went out of my way to get my hands on a physical copy of the music on a CD. I live in Japan so I was able to track down the official CD and get it for myself.

The combat is fun and intuitive. Some weapons I believe are just straight up broken compared to others. But, all weapons can easily be used to beat even the toughest endgame bosses. Platinum games really does know how to make action combat games. If you like action combat, this is definitely worth a grab.

Art is just beautiful even for a PS4 era game. Especially the character models of the main cast if you know what I mean.

The story needs you to complete endings A B C D E to understand fully the real ending. Unlike Nier Replicant, Automata makes each play through feel different even if story points are generally the same between ending A and B. I enjoyed working through each story as the characters were all likable to a degree. Without going into spoilers I will say I generally felt bad for most characters throughout the game. Especially once you start going through ending C. I am not one to tear up or feel sad after seeing events unfold in movies or games but this game tugged at my heartstrings. Someone was definitely cutting onions around me I swear.

Overall: This is easily a 10/10 game and I highly recommend everyone play it. If you liked Nier Replicant or didn't like it for it's repetitive nature, then I think you will like this game. This is Nier Replicant but better in every single way.",1680623877,1680623877,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Incredible story that explores a lot of heavy themes, amazing characters
- A very atmospheric world with lots of variety
- The chip system works well, both in the story, [deleting the HUD, etc.] as well as allowing a lot of unique and fun builds
- Ending E is amazing
- The different routes system as a whole is very nice, but is some places does stagnate a bit [Route B is fundamentally just Route A gameplay wise, but only slightly different in a few sections]
- I am personally not a big fan of Hack and Slash games and the gameplay did feel quite repetitive after a while, especially in Route B, and as such that takes away a bit from its replayability

 I digress. Often her majestic exquisit√© shrouds (and rightfully so) the utter brilliance of Yoko Taro's work, he put more life into these mere androids than that can be seen in the mass population.

That is the only word befitting such a beautiful game which is rightly praised as highly as it is.
The gameplay is smooth, sleek and easy.
The locations are stunning and unique, from the muted black and white of the space station you visit to upgrade yourself, also known as The Bunker, to the lush and verdant abandoned city which nature has rightfully reclaimed as her own you cannot help but just stop and pan the camera to take it all in.
The soundtrack is worthy of every award going, it fits the atmosphere of any situation from the unforgiving and deadly desert, to being attacked by an operatic killer robot, you will have this album downloaded just to listen to its beauty all over again.

PROS
+ Music and soundtrack are legit impressive.

CONS
- Combat system is extremely shallow, especially by PlatinumGames' standards.
- Muddy visuals and poor environmental detail, installing a texture replacement mod is practically a requirement to play.
- Hacking mini-game and shoot'em up sequences, while novel at first, get tiresome fast.
- Tons of shallow, repetitive, and unsatisfying fetch quests that have you retreading the same ground over and over and over again.
- Exasperatingly melodramatic story that keeps hitting you over the head with its narrative themes. Very cringy characters and an overabundance of r/im14andthisisdeep type existentialism.",1680324599,1680324599,False,2,0,0.479292124509811401,0,True,False,False

I would give it a neutral review if that was possible, but I think it needs more ciritcal reviews and not only overly positive ones that really don't tell much other than: OMG BEST GAME EVER.
For me it was more of a ""meh"" game.

No technical difficulties on my end, which most negative reviews have, so what's the problem?

-Boring and repetetive gameplay [spoiler] looking at you second playthrough  [/spoiler]
-Very basic combat stystem: normal attack, heavy attack, ranged fire and dodge (with small additions)
 Enemies are just damage sponges on higher difficulties and I didn't feel any interest on playing at a higher difficulty, which I 
 usually do in every game
-Visually boring world design

-Story started ok, but got a bit annoing for me.
Game is about philosophical questions about human existence and life in general, but sadly not done very well. 
(inspired by Existentialism I guess)
At least for me it didn't work out. Might appeal to younger people that never were confronted with those questions or ideas.
I cannot explain else why people might like the story that much, and at the same time it is not done that well sadly.
What characters do and how they feel made often no sense to me. [spoiler]for example when 9S goes ""mad"" or how you want to 
call it. 
Sure he might sink into despair because of the events that happened but ye, felt just like the standard ""charakter goes insane in 
animes for no reason bollocks""
Especially when there were multiple occasions where he just could have talked to A2 about 2B's death and so on.[/spoiler] 
There are quite some other logical problems in the storytelling.

The story was also very predictable to me.
There were very few things that I didn't see coming for example [spoiler] the death of 2B[/spoiler]. 
Also the game tries very hard to make you care about all those characters, so hard that I couldn't care less.
It was so obvious that the storytelling just tries to build up that emotional bonding to the characters just for the reason to then [spoiler] kill pretty much all of them later in the game. [/spoiler]

So this game might appeal to a certain audience that likes the story, for me it sadly didn't work and the gameplay itself was not interesting enough for me to carry it.

And every ending is so beautiful.

Nier Automata is not a perfect game... but it feels so perfect.
I cannot say much about the game, just know that the characters, the world, the start and beginning are so, so important.
The tiniest details, the large upcoming doom. Every conversation, every insight, everything. Savor it. Taste it. Feel it. And then empathize with it.

Understand that it might be a slog in the middle, but it is so worth it for the absolutely fantastic climax and ending.
Nier Automata is not perfect, but 2B, 9S, and A2 made it an absolute charming game to play, watch, and experience.

Naturally, I became curious about her personality and wanted to learn more about her. But instead of just learning more about her, what this game had to offer was more than just that. This game has an amazing and engaging deep story, strong and memorable characters, one of the best and most beautiful soundtracks in a game, great gameplay and fantastic graphics.

[h1] Story [/h1]

Aliens have taken over Earth and built machines to beat humans. Humans has no choice but to escape over to the moon in order to survive. Now humans wants to reclaim back Earth, humans have created androids in order to fight against the machines. Simple no? No. This couldn't be further from the truth. As you play the game and go through all the quests and side-quests, the simplicity goes away and there's more to this than meets the eye. You uncover the mysteries and learn a lot more about the story and the characters. The storytelling in this game is incredibly unique and something I've never seen before. The story goes extremely deep and you easily get sucked into it. 

[h1] Characters [/h1]

Aside 2B's amazing personality, the cast of main characters and NPC's in this game is really great. The 3 main androids, 2B, 9S and A2 have amazing character design, good personalities, and backstory. Out of the three, my favorite would be A2. I love her voice, personality and I really enjoyed her chemistry with Pod. In general, they're all badass and interesting.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The combat gameplay in this game is fantastic and feels satisfying. It's a hack and slash game, a lot like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. The upgrading system called plug-in chips feels rewarding to use once you start upgrading and it makes combat more diverse and fun. 2B and A2 have similar controls but 9S has a hacking mechanism which I found to be alright.   The difficulty really amps up in the second half of the game. I played the game on hard difficulty and I find that the perfect difficulty to play on if you want to challenge yourself.

[h1] Soundtrack [/h1]

I really really enjoyed the Soundtrack/OST of this game. I enjoy game soundtracks a lot and NieR Automata absolutely delivers it. The soundtrack really ties into the story so well and the emotional moments of the game. I enjoyed the idea of changing the soundtrack right after a certain quest ends or during a certain moment, it changes the mood of the game. It enhances the game and quests and puts an emphasis on soundtracks even more. My favorite would have to be [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABvi5qegodY] ""Voice of no Return."" [/url]

[h1] Graphics [/h1]

I didn't play this game vanilla, I had modded the game on my first playthrough. I had heard that the port was not done well and you needed to mod the game so you can fully enjoy the game. So I did, I installed FAR, Reshade with Clean Reshade Present, High Texture Pack and Better Cutscene using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/nierautomata/mods/140] NAMH [/url] and the end result is the game looking absolutely gorgeous. The scenery of every place, the Desert, the Cities, the Forest Kingdom looked amazing. I would stop from time to time just to take in the view and just admire the beautiful view and sky. I can't recommend enough modding this game to enhance your experience even more.

[h1] Con [/h1]

-It requires some modding to make the experience of the game even better.
-Not enough A2 screentime.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

I came for 2B's personality, came out depressed after finishing all routes. This game has made me emotionally invested in its story and characters. I played it for a week straight and I don't regret it at all. To put it simply, I fell in love with the game, the characters, soundtrack, and world. It has surpassed everything I thought this game would be and it has blown my heart in pieces.",1680184659,1680185632,True,2,0,0.519685029983520508,0,True,False,False

The story is a complex, emotionally charged journey that leaves a lasting impression, and the stunning graphics and epic soundtrack only serve to enhance the experience.

From the very beginning of Nier Automata, players are immediately thrust into a world that is both strange and familiar. The post-apocalyptic setting is beautifully rendered, with a level of detail that is truly awe-inspiring. From the crumbling ruins of the city to the overgrown forests and desolate wastelands, every inch of this world has been lovingly crafted and is a testament to the dedication and skill of the game's developers.

But it's not just the graphics that are impressive; the story of Nier Automata is equally engrossing. Set in a world where humans have been forced to flee to the moon and leave Earth to the machines, the game follows the adventures of androids 2B and 9S as they fight to reclaim their planet. Along the way, they encounter a cast of unforgettable characters, each with their own motivations and secrets.

The narrative of Nier Automata is both deeply philosophical and deeply emotional, exploring themes of identity, free will, and the nature of humanity. The game does not shy away from tackling difficult questions, and the result is a story that is both thought-provoking and heart-wrenching.

Of course, no discussion of Nier Automata would be complete without mentioning its stunning soundtrack. Composed by Keiichi Okabe, the music perfectly captures the mood and atmosphere of the game, from the haunting melodies of the ruined city to the epic orchestral pieces that accompany the game's most intense battles. The voice acting is also superb, with the talented cast bringing each character to life in a way that is both authentic and moving.

In short, Nier Automata is a game that is truly greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are breathtaking, the story is unforgettable, and the soundtrack is nothing short of sublime. Whether you're a fan of action games or simply appreciate a good story, this game is an absolute must-play.",1680175459,1680175459,True,3,0,0.545219659805297852,1,True,False,False

I'll keep it short, I'm leaving this negative review because of some poor creative decisions made by the dev team when making this game. 

For one, if you don't do any of the rather dull fetch/side quests whilst playing through as 2B and 9S, you find yourself woefully under-levelled later. To the point where simple machines become harder to beat than set-piece bosses, and why would I be interested in eating a fish given to me by the token comic relief character for a secret ending, when the main story is so enthralling?

Next, when playing as 9S, I just couldn't master the hacking mini-games, which took away from the gameplay significantly. 

Later on, after a long period playing as 2B where I couldn't save, I became A2, and fought a boss that I struggled for a long period with. After this, I awoke as 9S, and realised I needed more healing salves. I went to the trader in the resistance camp, and found that I had to sell a bunch of my stuff before being able to buy more. I began spamming sell on all my useless junk items, before accidentally selling my 'OS Chip' - which for some fucking awful reason, was hidden in my inventory. If you sell this random item, you die. Le funny secret ending is unlocked, and you re-spawn. I re-spawned 2 hours of game-play earlier. Fuck that. 

The general map layout is also repetitive and boring. Having to play through the city ruins for the 8th time as 9S became a little dull. The collision on the map is also just broken. 

The game offers fun and innovative combat though, which was by far my favourite non-story part of the game. I'd recommend playing the first play-through as 2B for sure - a fun little experience. The story definitely picks up past this, but the game design just didn't do it for me personally. A let down.",1680058201,1680078425,False,0,0,0.472972989082336426,0,True,False,False

In the scant amount of time I had experienced with Nier, I can finally say I understand the hype behind this game. 

I would normally not give reviews on games but Nier has both recontextualized how I view my life: both the good and the bad. The story,sound, and pacing are all phenomenal. It is one of those games that I wish I could relive the first time playing over again.

I got this game at launch back in 2017 on PS4, platinumed it and bought it again here on PC because I think great like this can't be locked to old hardware. On PC the game is eternal and can be played with higher quality now and in the future.

It's great to be able to replay favorite games on more modern and capable hardware, as it can transform the experience quite a bit.
With incredibly fluid and fast paced combat, Nier Automata is a joy to play. Everything feel good and responsive to control. The characters are great with cool designs, paired with an interesting story that put a lot of questions related to human behavior that cannot be explained by logic. It's a story about machines and androids fighting each other and developing human emotions in the process and in consequence bringing the complexity of the human mind with it, including the bad things.

Another interesting part of this game is how unique it is considering how it interacts with the player and the things that you can do. There are multiple endings and many other stuff that I can't really talk about without entering spoiler territory. Most of it become evident near the ending of the game.
If you know Yoko Taro, you know what I'm talking about. The guy is crazy and genius at the same time, and he brings all the craziness into the game lol

Graphics are average, it still looks like a PS3 game but the art style and designs make up for it by a lot.
The soundtrack is also top notch. Nier Automata does so many things right that the graphics aren't really an issue.
The PC Port is also good right now. I played at 1440p 60fps Max settings on a RTX 2060 Super, no frame rate drops, no stutters, no crashes. Zero issues. It's very polished the way it is right now, but I know it's been a very long journey since launch with patches and that Square Enix haven't provided quality support for this game on PC.

I absolutely recommend this game. It's one of my favorite games ever.
Good characters, excellent combat, good soundtrack and very unique stuff that you won't see in other games.
Just keep in mind that to truly beat the game, you have to finish it 3 times. First you play as 2B, then you play as 9S which is the game story but with his perspective, and then you play the last route with A2, which is the continuation of the story afterwards and the true ending. The A2 route is the best in the game and is incredibly fun to play.

If you see this game on sale and you're interested in playing it, just buy it immediately. Square Enix almost never puts this game on sale. It may be on sale now, but keep in mind that it stayed over a year without any discount.",1679702229,1680027052,True,3,0,0.554910898208618164,0,True,False,False

As you cannot save during the first section of the game, I had to restart from the beginning when this happened, and could not finish the first section.

As for the gameplay, I did enjoy what time I spent playing without bugs. This issue simply tired me out trying to restart from the beginning multiple times to see if the issue was resolved, and I was unable to figure out how to fix it.

Edit 03.28.2023: Years later and after a PC rebuild, I am no longer running into the mentioned issue. Perhaps it was patched, a rare oddity, or my previous system had more trouble handling it than expected (despite being able to run newer games fine). I plan to rewrite this review once I have completed the game.",1538256340,1679995155,False,2,0,0.470886707305908203,0,True,False,False

You want to hit enemies from certian distance? NO what you get is keep pressing button and keep hitting the enemy.
You want to slice n dice the enemy? NO what you get is button mash close combat system dog shit.
You want a good story? NO what you get is dog shit story that doesnt even make sense.
The navigation of map is absolute cancer shit.
The camera angles are shit.
There is no boss fight but just same copy paste shit npcs spamming orbs all day long fuck your stupid game piece of shit designers.
Litarelly everything about the game is shit, whoever designed this game and put lil to zero effort on it well fuck you then you wasted my time and money you dip shit.

The way it is setup, puts you in an extremely hard mission you must complete without dying to start the story off. then, the game gets pretty easy and simple to understand, then hits a point where they give no explanation on how to do an important act which leads to 6 boss fights in a row without refilling gear in between. Depending on your choices, you are ultimately going to barely beat this game, even on easy mode. Then you gotta do it 2 more times to get access to the DLC. If you want to look at 2B, just use websites.

To add to this, I'm on the second, run that you do from another POV, and it literally is the same impossible start to get through, I made it to the very end and died because I skipped a cutscene, so now the past hour I spent on this opening scene was for nothing.

The story is amazing, each of it's three main endings bringing more interesting revelations about the main cast that I could easily understand, but we're still shocking. Story wise this game gets a Definite Pass.
The Game-play Is a hassle for a bit but eventually you get used to it and it starts feeling (Mostly) natural. Game-play Gets a Pass
Visuals are kinda bipolar, sometimes they seem alright, & sometimes they look like a PS3 game. No ones mouth move outside of cut scenes (from what I saw) and a lot of effects look low budget, such as explosions & such. Character models who aren't main cast look.....basic, not bad, just not a lot of effort. Main cast character models look nice though. Can't decide it pass or fail so I'll say......Sure?

While i do prefer Replicant this was a great experience as well. My only negative is that after playing the previously mentioned game you know the lies and cover up from the start with the moon stuff. I also found it less enjoyable and motivating to do re-playthroughs than in Replicant. In ""R"" i was shocked by B route alone while i think you need to be in late c route of Automata to even match the story of R A route. R was just so much sadder, i think this was due to the plot not being revealed to me yet of this world and the fact that people were still around or thought they were.Negatives aside i was left content with the E ending at least. The overall gameplay and open world is a step up here as well. Its hard to say what game had stronger characters but i would have to say R because those later routes hit me hard and changed my entire view on the protagonist while my view never changed in this game, story just got better in C. I think thats my main complaint, R made my jaw drop multiple times while i was pretty out of the story in this one and i never felt for the machines unlike the shades. But i do believe this was the next best thing they could of done with their multiple playthrough series lmao.Anyway pick it up if u enjoyed Replicant or just want a story heavy game, i enjoyed my time",1679816525,1679816525,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I dropped it barely an hour in. But there was a part of me that knew I didn't give this a game a real chance and it turns out that part was very right.[h1] Second time's the charm[/h1] Years later and with some JRPG experience I picked it up again and boy haven't I been able to put it down since! I don't really want to go into all the details of why this game is great but let me just say that no game about robots (or maybe any game) has ever been able to touch on the core of what it is to be human and to feel and ... 2B (hah).[h1] Singing the praise[/h1] The combat is great and the bullet hell flight unit segments are few and far between to the point where they're a nice change of pace. The music is ...unbelievable. The characters are simple on the surface but certainly offer depth when you're inclined to look for it. I don't even want to comment on the story and lore.[h1] Conclusion[/h1] So if you're like me and you were put off by the bullet hell flight unit intro and the simple looking enemies, don't be, it gets really good really fast and stays good pretty much throughout the experience. It is one of those rare ""core videogames"" where I would argue if you enjoy video games in general you will like this.[h1] Spoilers [/h1] Mild spoilers for a little advice:[spoiler]There is no harm in focusing on the main story quests until you unlock fast travel, nothing will lock out at that point. If you feel like you might burn out while at the same time being compelled to do the side content don't be, you get another chance to do most side content later, so feel free to push the story as much as you want. You'll understand once you get there.[/spoiler][h1] Edit[/h1] Steam seems to have effed up review formatting so there's no line breaks for some reason. That's why there's these unnecessary headlines everywhere lmao.",1679787212,1679787630,True,1,0,0.512195110321044922,0,True,False,False

The game's story is expertly crafted, weaving together complex themes of humanity, morality, and the meaning of existence in a way that is both thought-provoking and deeply moving.

The gameplay is also top-notch, with a seamless blend of action-packed combat and exploration that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The combat system is fluid and intuitive, allowing for a wide variety of play styles and approaches to each battle.

But what really sets Nier: Automata apart is its stunning visuals and mesmerizing soundtrack. The game's post-apocalyptic world is a wonder to behold, with richly detailed environments and character designs that are both beautiful and haunting. And the soundtrack, composed by the legendary Keiichi Okabe, is an absolute masterpiece that perfectly captures the game's melancholic tone.

Overall, Nier: Automata is a must-play for anyone who enjoys action-packed games with deep, thought-provoking stories. It's a truly unique experience that will stay with you long after you've finished playing

There are cracks on walls where you think you can pass from there, but you can't because invisible walls blocking the cracks. And when there is a really poor map design, you constantly force yourself to get thru those cracks.

The combat is great, even though you do the same thing over and over it doesn't feel too repetitive since the game forces and gives you the option to change the way  you fight. The story works perfectly fine as a standalone game, but knowing a few things from previous installations might prove handy. Grapchis are very good, if not the actual graphical quality, but the graphic design is top-notch. The soundtrack is amazing, so much so that I bought it separately and listen to it all the time. Regarding the port, I had one crash and no real performance issues, though I do think it necessary to install FAR on every machine.

Overall this game will be the ones I'll reminisce about and come back to in the years to come. I've never seen anything quite like NieR:Automata and am extremely glad I picked it up.

Oh, and, there is the fanservice. It's up to the individual player to form their own opinion of it, but it never got to the point of bothering me.

Post-100%-achievements edit: Many years and an almost complete replay later, my opinion of NieR Automata hasn't really changed. Combat is still fun and engaging, although maybe there are a few more annoying bits than I remembered. Or I just suck at two-stick stuff. Story was definitely more impactful the first time around, but it was still a pleasure to go down somewhat of a memory lane. And as I'd written in my OG review, having played a bit of Replicant did affect the experience, although not game-changingly. Definitely would undergo amnesia just to play this game for the first time again.",1501111244,1679264252,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

And man does it still hit home hard. Platinum nailed the gameplay and combat. Reminded me more of Bayonetta than the original Nier. Music is still incredible and simply beautiful. Game looks great, albeit a little muted in the color area. The open world is also well done. The areas are unique and really make the world breathe. No bugs or issues to note. The story is simply amazing. It is not deep, in fact, it is very simple, yet very effective at what it is trying to portray. Get all the main endings to really feel the weight of the story. The characters also make you root and cheer for their success. There is really nothing negative to say about this game. I hope Taro, Platinum and Enix can work on a new game, or the very least remake DRAKENGARD!

The only nitpicks I have is there is one scene with 2B that you have to travel to a certain area with a certain issue (do not want to spoil it, but you will know it when you see it) it is still awkward after all these years. But that is my opinion. and the 2nd is grinding. Just like Nier, grinding for the weapons is less tedious than Nier, but it is still rough. and the 3rd nitpick is locking the Replicant costumes behind the hard arenas. They are basically end game content, so that is a disappointment, but not hard to get to level 99. It did not quite reach the story and characters of Nier Gestalt/Replicant, but it is still a better game overall.

With that all said and done, Automata is a great sequel? to the original Nier. Automata is the better game. While Nier is weaker on the gameplay and combat, the story and characters IMO are just better. I suggest to play Replicant 1.22 first as they do reference it a little bit, so it makes Automata that much better. Just get both games. If you like a great story and characters Replicant is for you, but if you like a great overall game, then Automata is for you. Just get both and then question everything in your life. Get this game already.",1679259087,1679259087,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Being a recovering weeb myself, I shunned it for quite some time, thinking that despite hearing snippets of what the story was about I still probably would not enjoy it. Then, I heard the soundtrack...

I asked a few friends who I knew had played the game before for recommendations. I have enjoyed other Platinum games in the past, Metal Gear Rising: Revengence (not a word) being my favorite from the studio. With the soundtrack in my head and endorsements in hand, I went ahead and bought it. After finishing it, my mind may have been changed on my favorite Platinum game.

This was a slog, but a great one. If you have played any of the Sonic Adventure games, the structure will be similar. You play the game 3 times, and each time it's different. Each time the story changes, more information about the world is drip fed to you, and you slowly discover the truth behind everything. It's very well done. The game play, story, and music all keep you engaged. I give a strong recommendation to anyone who enjoys spectacle fighter games.

For Achievement Hunters: [spoiler] There is a shop that you unlock after completing the final story line that allows you to purchase achievements that you may have missed along the way, which is awesome because there is a ton of content that can be missed. Please note that [i] not all achievements can be purchased here[/i] which I found out the hard way. I would recommend using a guide if you want to complete the game 100%, but to avoid spoilers for the story, skim for ""Endings"" and for ""Weapons"". This should hopefully allow you to do what you need to without spoiling things too much, because there are parts of the story that could have less impact if you read about them beforehand. There is an excellent guide by Cynic 0055, I would highly recommend using.[/spoiler]",1679250019,1679250019,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is similar to most hack and slash games (like devil may cry series) and it has its own unique mechanics. Enjoyable for the most part. 8/10

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
It could use some improvements in certain areas (like better lighting in specific areas, not going to spoil), but it still looks awe inspiring. 9/10

[h1] Story [/h1]
I will not spoil it for you. This is the main selling point of the game. The characters,plot,areas,humor, etc are all crafted for you to have a great experience. You need atleast 3 playthroughs to understand everything (each playthrough changes the perspective of the story + continuation of last part). Here is a tip instead: don't watch a ""let's play"" or a stream or read online reviews about the game. if you get  a major spoiler, the game is no longer as enjoyable as it could be.
Definitely a masterpiece 10/10

[h1]Audio[/h1]
The second selling point of this game. The music is top-notch. It never gets repetitive and you will find yourself humming along in no time. 10/10

[h1]Performance[/h1]
I have a dying hdd, i7-8750H, 8GB ram, gtx 1050 Ti. I am able to run the game on 1920x1080 Ultra 50-60 fps (55 fps average) with very very few fps drops (due to dying hdd). I fail to see what the people who claim ""the game is poorly optimized"" are talking about.
I will update this section once I get an ssd.
EDIT:: After getting an SSD and upgrading RAM, it runs 60fps smooth with no drops at all.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
While the game can be played with keyboard and mouse, it just feels weird to do so. It is a way better experience to use a controller.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Ignore all the memes about 2B. The characters will grow dear to your heart that you won't be able to think of them that way. This is the type of game that makes you think and strikes a chord inside you. I consider this game to be game of the year 2017 (not official, while botw isnt bad at all, nier:automata is just more immersive story wise)",1604810289,1679181697,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Imma give a list of Pros and Cons to describe how almost perfect this game is.

Also as an important note: I highly recommend anyone that's interested in playing this game to at least look up a walkthrough of Nier 1, because it gives more context to the story of Automata. There's a lot of really amazing moments that you'll miss out on if you didn't play/watch Nier 1. I recommend the Nier Lp by the SuperBestFriends

Pros:

+Fantastic Combat that's simple on the surface but with many layers if looked a bit deeper. This is an overall huge improvement from the first game since Nier 1's combat is overall not great.

+Segments that shift the gameplay game, making it more and more fresh all the time. Every now and then the game will change from 3d action game to a shmup (Shoot em up) to a twin stick shooter. Nier 1 also had these shifts, which helped it quite a bit given it's mediocre gameplay.

+Amazing fully realized and thematic story that would be impossible to tell in any other medium. This is not an exaggeration, anyone that disagrees straight up didn't finish the game.

+Fantastic English dub. Everyone gives their all in this one, especially whoever played 9S.

+Great amount of customization. While it isn't Dark Souls levels, there's many different weapons to choose from, many different plugin chips that give abilities to your character.

+Tons of (mostly)Fantastic Side Quests, often giving insight to the world of Nier along with fun banter between the main characters.

Alright, now I'm gonna get into the bad stuff. Don't worry, this won't take long.
Cons:

-I can't ignore this issue. The PC version isn't great overall. If you're interested in getting this game, I'd honestly recommend getting the PS4 version over this. However if this is your only choice, or you don't care, there is a few work arounds. Specifically a mod called FAR, it's more or less the DSfix of this game. If you want the game for your PC, I highly recommend getting that mod, as it fixes a lot of the problems the PC version has.

-There's some sidequests that are really gimmicky and not fun to play, which can especially be annoying for the completionists.

And that's it, honestly those issues are so minor (except maybe the pc issue for some people) that I can't imagine anyone having any actual issue with the game because of it.

Overall, I'd highly recommend it for anyone that likes video games. To some, it just might not be the type of game you like, and that's ay-ok, but I really hope you give it an honest try before judging it. Because this game is something that holds a really special place in my heart, and is something I will be playing for years to come.",1514220129,1679122412,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The visual design and aesthetics combine the modern JRPG style with a unique and captivating mix of almost goth, film noir, and apocalyptic themes with sensational clarity. The gameplay is easy to comprehend for those who are versed in action RPGs, but rich and in-depth enough with additional elements of ranged tactics and customization of skills and passive abilities. It is also difficult enough to keep you focused in every battle so that it never really feels like your grinding or endlessly battling nuisance enemies without any real reward. 
The sound design, voice acting and music are right at home with the world and the characters. There's tension, conflict, beauty, somber moments, and subtle shifts to make the player feel part of the experience and really immersed in the environments. 
Bottom line is this game is a blast to play, story rich, intriguing, breaks the mold of what action RPGs feel like while still keeping to a successful formula that is easy to grasp.

I want to preface this review with telling you that i am very biased to NieR: Automata. Nier together with 2 other games is a game that got me through a tough time in my life. So much that i even incorporated the virtuous Treaty, one of the heavy blades 2B starts with, into my first tattoo. So do keep this in mind.

NieR: Automata made by Square Enix in cooperation with Platinum Games brought the entire NieR series to a new direction the entire series sorely needed. There is a very good reason why you never heard of the NieR series before Automata, the simple explanation to this is that NieR, NieR Replicant (not the remasterd one that came out in 2021)  and NieR Gestalt largely missed the mark in terms of gameplay. Reviews of NieR point at how the game didn't look good, the controls felt clunky but the story was good.
Sadly this is many cases a flaw of Square Enix, Square is good at making interesting stories and if looked at the recent mainline games quite good at making a game look apealing but the gameplay of action games have always been tough for them.
Slide in Platinum Games, a studio incredibly well known and well loved in the gaming space for their (mostly) flawless creation of high stakes action games such as but not limited to: The Bayonetta series, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and in this case NieR: Automata and you get a legendary combination.
But enough background and gloating, let's get to the review shall we?

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
NieR: Automata is first and foremost an action game focused on quick reflexes and stylishly killing whatever stands in your way. This begins with your weapons which are mostly divided up into 4 major archetypes: Small swords, Large swords, Spears and Combat Bracers, The latter of which being combat gloves. All 4 can be held in what order you want but a max of 2 weapons can be equipped. Be that a large sword and a spear, 2 Combat Bracers or any other combination you can think of. Together with this you also slot Plug-In chips into your character. These can range from auto regeneration to firing off shock-waves every time you attack and range from level 1 to 8. These are however limited to the amount of storage you have, increases of this can be bought from merchants and storage usage is determined by the level the Plug-In chips you have installed.

[h1]Soundtracks[/h1]
In terms of Soundtrack no words i could say would do it much justice, yes it is just that good. There is a very valid and good reason why this game has gotten 3 awards for best soundtrack! The soundtracks of NieR: Automata are ones I frequently come back to because they are just that good. This coupled with the fact that overall sound design is flawless here makes for an experience you won't soon forget.

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
Visuals are in a way a hit and miss. NieR: Automata was first and foremost a console game, this very much shows itself in the PC version that has rather low quality textures and models when compared to the console versions. Things that are fixed with the help of mods but these do not (in my opinion) count for a review of the base game. 

The console to PC porting also shows itself rather unsightly in terms of controls, the keyboard controls aren't well done in the slightest. Controls that don't make sense or straight up demand you hold a button that only gets in the way while fighting. Issues that sadly immediately go away the moment you play this with a controller, making it basically mandatory to own a controller that can connect to your PC.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Story-wise NieR: Automata is an easy 10/10 and a definite must experience. You can't however expect to have seen the full story in just one playthrough. As some of you might already know NieR: Automata needs 3 playthroughs in total, the first of which being the story through 2B's eyes, a combat unit created with the task of eliminating all machines, asking you the question of 'what puts humans apart from machines if the same behaviors can be seen from both', The 2nd being that same story through 9S' eyes, a recon unit that has to start working together with 2B due to some unforeseen circumstances. The third being a new story that I will not tell you anything about as it is the better of the 3.

[h1]Level Design[/h1]
Last but not least is level design. NieR: Automata is an open world game set on an earth that was broken down by some outside force (which i will not tell you about what this was for story's sake) yet now houses various hostile machines. These locations are a spectacle to behold and do make you want to look for even more beautiful scenes. Luckily these don't suffer from the aforementioned visual issues as much as more closed parts of the game does.

Overall I can recommend NieR: Automata to a great deal of you reading this. With stunning sound design, breathtaking views, satisfying combat and absolutely gorgeous level design it should already be in your library or wishlist.",1673621434,1678977915,True,2,0,0.524371743202209473,0,True,False,False

It has interesting characters and story. Loot and combat system are wel performed since everything you find is usefull and every encounter has it's meaning. 
To finish a base story you have to play the game three-times. You get three main endings as you witness the story from the perspective of three characters (every playthrough is different). Then you have a fourth ending whitch adds some flavour to all of it. And then if you don't have enough you can obtain another 23 (24 with DLC) smaller, less significant endings which are fun and adds some more reasons to replay the game. Hell, I didn't even get them all for now. 

Pros and Cons:
+ Story and Characters
+ Entertaining combat and progression system
+ Multiple storylines and endings
+ High replayability value
+ Lots of interesting mechanics such as upgrading your character with plug-in chip that you develop on your own
+ Weapon variability and combinations

Summary
How this game works basically is they bait you with sexy android waifus then educate you about philosophy. Some of the NPCs are named after actual Philosophers, which actually showcase their philosophy and everything wrong with it(Except for Sartre, this game definitely hates Sartre). 

Gameplay(7/10)
Combat: You get to play as 3 different androids, 2 of is just an upgrade of each other but one of them lets you posses other robots by hacking into their system through a bullet hell interface. I've heard lots of westerners hating on the combat, calling it mindless button mashing but that's completely false if you take a minute or 2 to check out the combos and movement. It only takes a minute to learn I swear. The NPC Robot possession mechanic is great but it DOES NOT let you fly with units that are clearly supposed to fly (kinda annoying TBH)

Open World: The invisible walls sucks poopoohole though, it makes sense for before Ending B because you need permissions to do certain stuff but the game implies(through narrative) that you're on you're own after Ending B but the Invisible walls still exist T^T  I mean I get why it's there but it just sucks especially after playing something like BOTW

Scripted Areas: The game goes from twin stick shooter, side scrolling gradius-like shooter, shoot em up(angled and top down), 3rd person. platformer, angled shooter, bullet hell etc. Very refreshing. I love stuff like this but you're definitely gonna hate it if you're a mono-genre kind of person(no shame)

Mounts: Kinda annoying that there's this 2 second wait time before you can mount a pig/moose

Difficulty: Doesn't affect the story, hard mode just takes away your ability to lock on

Sound Design(10/10)
The music is context based, the instrument changes based on what you're doing or where you are in the game. UI Clicks sounds good too, especially the pause (not the menu) SFX is satisfying. THE ENGLISH VOICES ARE ACTUALLY GOOD, I usually go with Japanese Audio when playing Japanese games but the English VAs did an outstanding job, bravo bravo 

Graphics(8/10)
UI is great, it's definitely one the best if not the best. It's completely customizable and you can even turn it off(Rare for a Japanese game), and turning it off actually affects your stats. 

PC Graphics for this game is poopoo compared to the console version, I played in 4k and 2k, some of the textures are eyecandy then boom a 240p jpeg texture attached to a crate, but overall it's great especially the characters(A2 and 2B's ass is 10/10). But when it's good, it's REALLY good 

The Animation is excellent, A2 and 2B's slow walk animation is super hot. Their lips don't move in game while they're talking with each other though(like Dark Souls), kinda weird but forgivable. The lips doesn't sync with the English dialogues during cutscenes though

I recently started playing again on PC, and the nostalgia/fresh controls (keyboard+mouse instead of controller) have made it a unique experience. I still prefer controller, obviously; but even on mouse and key this game is phenomenal and the control scheme is pretty well streamlined to make it easier for you. I 100% recommend this game to anyone who has thought about playing or anyone who's on the fence about it. You'll absolutely love it. The story is intense and deep, the characters are amazing and go through development throughout the game, there are cameos and callbacks for those who remember Replicant, there are nods to other games, and (if you're into that sort of thing) there's plenty of ""assets"" you can view through your playthrough. If you aren't into that sort of thing: you can adjust the camera to make it follow your character more closely, which will solve that issue. If that's your argument for not playing this masterpiece, just adjust some settings and get through the story. It's worth it, trust me.",1678596223,1678596223,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want to enjoy this game, you need to mod it else its sucks. 
Basically you need to install things mentioned in the below youtube video.

Game has a good replay ability because it will allow you to play different characters in 3 replays. So lot of perspective to the game as to what went down. Once you have mod the game as per above it becomes a really good game and you can enjoy it properly. So get it when it go cheap , mod it and play it to your heart content. Hope this helps you. 

in order to get the best ending you need to achive and ending with C or D and then finish the mini gamein credits. only then you will get the true best ending. good luck. I thought i only love Lara, but i do love 2B as well it seems xD

I love the combat, music, voice work, the characters (must protect Pascal) and story(Although there are some ""odd"" bits). You can tell this game was a true passion project. On the other hand there infuriating little things that make you wonder how they got into the game in the first place. 
Such as 
2B tripping over every bush or rock in existance
Eve's final boss removes all the fun of melee combat (the thing the game was built around) and instead has you shooting him for 30 mins while you slowly walk around
Eve's bossfight also doesn't have any clear boundary's
You still trip over shit in Eve's bossfight 
The Adam and Eve aren't even great villians. They're so annoyingly melodramatic 
I have to constantly fight the camera for control
The map is super confusing
Platforming is finicky 
Not being able to access your inventory unless 2B is on her feet 
Camera going from 3d to 2d is a fun occasional gimic. Not something you use literally everywhere. Especailly when the enemies you fight in 2d still have 3d movement
My pods charge attack shoots over everyones head in 2d mode
Cross hair disappears when it gets close to the enemy 
The cross hair is shitty in general
S T U N L O C K 

Like I want to give this game a 10/10 but there's just all of these little things that make it super fucking annoying to play  6/10. Good but needs QOL improvements. Also the PC port feels really shitty, or at least I assume the PC port is the issue and the PS4 version isn't like this.

524220,133997074,76561198115584907,0,2,2765,0,2765,1678642458,"Having played Automata after the Replicant remake/remaster/rewhatever, it's difficult to exactly place my thoughts. Almost everything that made Replicant the special experience it was still applies here. Well, almost. And most of that game's faults still remain. Aside from arguably the biggest one, but I'll get there.

Automata has a somewhat less impressive main cast of characters, or at least they didn't resonate as strongly with me. Even after fully completing the game and reading a bunch of side materials, I couldn't tell you much about 2B as a person. Same applies to 9S too, to be honest, but at least he receives a major character development in the third act of the game - said third act being the game's highest point by far, in part due to just how ballsy the narrative choices get. It's far exceeding Replicant's narrative there and doesn't commit that game's cardinal sin - which was Replicant's ""Route C"". This game doesn't really force you to replay it, but genuinely continues after Endings A and B. Route B, while repeating the events of Route A doesn't exactly repeat it's gameplay, then paves the way for Route C's massive impact, which finally reveals that, for all of its poor implementation in the original Nier, the Yoko Taro approach to multiple endings can be utterly ingenious when done right.

The game really shines in creating a very specific atmosphere. I've heard Taro's storytelling described as ""melancholic"" and I think that's the right term to describe it. The world, the themes, the sidequests - everything seems designed to make you feel a weird mix of nostalgia, sadness with a mild dash of hope.

The gameplay is really fun and dynamic and it very seamlessly mixes many types of games, from 2D to 3D, from bullet hell to hack n'slash and so forth. Neither feels lackluster and neither is boring. However, the difficulty balance is... just wrong. The action gameplay really feels hampered by RPG mechanics, especially the leveling system. It's far too easy to overlevel and kill any challenge, Normal mode is already easy enough as it is. Meanwhile Hard is usually just as easy... only everything kills you in 2 hits. So - the gameplay is good, but it could really benefit from removing EXP and levels in favor of a more action game-like approach to progression and a difficulty level about halfway between Automata's Normal and Hard.

Ending E is something I have little to say about without spoiling it. Many people resonated with it emotionally, quite strongly even. I did not. In fact, I don't even like it. Maybe you'll consider it profound. Maybe not. Even then, the game would be worth it even without it. I mean, I found both Endings C and D quite satisfying, which may have been one of the reasons why Ending E just didn't do it for me. It definitely is original and there's a vision behind it - even if it was one I failed to vibe with.

All in all, I like this game. A lot. And it's good. Way above average, even. I wouldn't exactly call it a masterpiece - but, like all of Yoko Taro's previous work, it has a stroke of genius about it. Even Drakengard 1, otherwise a bad game, had moments that showed potential, which Automata realizes - hell, in some parts of Route C, Drakengard 1's influence is felt more strongly than in either Replicant/Gestalt or Drakengard 3. Nier: Automata is a good game, more than worth anybody's time and money. And I honestly hope (not without ample reason to believe it) that the next time Taro makes something bigger than Voice of Cards, I will be able to genuinely call it a masterpiece.

The soundtrack is better than a masterpiece though.",1677873132,1677873132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good story and great gameplay to go along.

Nier Automata is an action-packed game that left a lasting impression on me. I was hooked by its world, captivating story, and engaging gameplay.
The game's narrative is both complex and thought-provoking, exploring themes of existence, purpose, and the human condition.

The gameplay is a blend of hack-and-slash action and RPG mechanics. The combat is fluid and rewarding. 
In addition, the music score is simply stunning. The game's beautiful soundtrack perfectly complements it and enhancing the overall gaming experience.

The score features a mix of orchestral and electronic elements, creating a unique and immersive soundscape. Overall, Nier Automata's music score is a masterpiece in its own right, and is one of the many reasons why this game is truly a work of art.

Overall, I would highly recommend Nier Automata to anyone who enjoys a good story-driven game with satisfying gameplay. It's a game that truly stands out from the crowd, and one that I'll be thinking about for a long time to come.

[b]NieR Automata is one of those scarce, rare games that can make such an lasting impression onto the player even years after experiencing it.[/b]

It had been roughly six years since I first laid my eyes upon Yoko Taro's masterpiece, and something just drawn me in [spoiler]and no, I don't mean it was 2B's ass- well, sorta[/spoiler]. There is a Brazillian youtuber in which I'm an decade old subscriber called ""Zangado"", whose made a video back in 2017 playing the prologue of Automata and sharing his initial thoughts. The first thing that stood out to me back then was the [b]music[/b], it is so different from anything I heard at the time that it just took a grasp of me, being something so beautiful and mesmerizing, [i]I knew I've just founded a gem between marbles.[/i]
My first impression with the gameplay was pretty positive, I haven't seen a game mix bullet-hell mechanics to hack-n slash before, the camera positioning also being very dynamic, making the gameplay reinvent itself whenever it could.
The story told in the game's prologue is a bold one: about an yet unknown android called 2B and her partner 9S, both having the mission to destroy the Goliath class enemy inside an abandoned factory. Looks plain on first sight, but the way it is told makes it stand out, much so that even after all these years, I still wondered what had happened with both 2B and 9S after their final resolution in the prologue.

[h1] 2B or not 2B? Here lies the question [/h1]

Fast forward to 2023. In this very year, I had the pleasure to play the game for the first time- [i]and it wasn't what I was expecting in any way, instead being much more than I could ever possibly fathom.[/i]

NieR is a game were the player really has to have the balls to continuously keep getting through, because you're drawn so deep into the story that mere events can change your entire mood depending on it, and I particularly had to take a break after a certain point because it was so much to bear, and that's something that never ocurried to me before, I could really feel the characters, the story, having a deeper meaning inside of me as it went on.

With no rush at all, I went beyond the limits in this game, making the most that I could had on a first playthrough, embracing my mistakes as they were out of my reach, trying to learn as much as possible via the game files, cutscenes, clearing out interactions with other NPCs, since this was the game I was craving for so long after all and I am NOT- a single bit- unsatisfied.
NieR Automata really can, and really WILL touch you deep with is storytelling and music, making itself an very lasting experience aside from every game you've played, because this is not just a silly little game, this is art in it's purest form. 

Have a taste of its terrific music- by Keiichi Okabe!

I really like the  post apocalyptic atmosphere of different locations, the OST is so good and fitting to the game that I listen to from time to time. The game play and combat is fluid which made my time playing very enjoyable. Achievements were fun to collect  [spoiler]there was one achievement I had to buy with in game currency because I did not have the patience to do so. [/spoiler] 
[spoiler]After viewing the final ending, I agreed to delete all my data so someone who plays Nier Automata who went out all the way could also view the final ending as well, I had to finish everything I wanted to do first before doing so. [/spoiler]

Play with a fast PC, I first played on a work PC which ran slow, didn't play it for a few years until getting a faster computer. 

I look forward to watch the Nier Automata anime when all the episodes come out in English dub with voice actors from the game.

No thanks to Square Enix for not giving Game of the Yorha edition for all owners of the standard edition. Greedy executives at SE, usually when games get remasters, all original owners get either an upgrade or the new addition for free.

     In an age when huge publishers like Sony have convinced many people that the only way to properly convey a games themes and ideas are through the conventions of film, Nier Automata is shamelessly and beautifully a video game. Nier is unconcerned with polygons or performance capture technology or hiring Hollywood animators to crunch into mental breakdowns for the sake of few more pixels on Nathan Drakes roguishly-raised eyebrow. 

     This is a game that truly needs to be played to fully understand its story and its characters. No amount of wiki entries can tell you all there is to be experienced in Nier Automata. It uses its gameplay and its mechanics to enhance its themes and musical score and characters in a hundred small ways over the course of its multiple routes and playthroughs that has rarely been attempted, let alone well executed, coming to a powerful and moving point in the games final moments. 

     The true ending of this game affected me so deeply that it reset my emotional response threshold. The way Yoko Taros characters and themes and unapologetic weirdness weave into Platinum Games masterfully satisfying character action and Keiichi Okabes powerful and emotional score has genuinely changed how I've thought and behaved since fully completing Nier Automata. I'm more easily moved by art and life and nature, even simple kindnesses shared between strangers. I've been inspired to express my love and appreciation for my friends and family in large or small ways more often, and I finally came out to my parents. 

     This game has genuinely changed my life for the better, for now and the foreseeable future...

Everything from the story, the characters, the music and the game play, it is without a doubt one of, if not the greatest games I've ever played. It often plays like a movie or an anime due to the cut scenes which I think adds to how phenomenal it actually is. You become extremely attached to the characters and although some of the events that happen to them are heartbreaking, it increased my resolve to see it through until the very end. Some critiques are that the upper tier difficulties are very unforgiving as well as the initial tutorial but other than that I have very few others.

Without mods, the game has a massive amount of stutter in the cut scenes, and background textures are a lower resolution. Square-Enix really dropped the ball on this port. HOWEVER... there are third party mods that address these issues. If you install FAR (Fix Automata Resolution) and an HD texture pack, the game will run smoothly and look much better.

Pros:
- Interesting story
- Controls are intuitive and responsive
- Variety of weapons and upgrades to suit your playstyle
- Variety in the gameplay, switching seamlessly between third person action, 2D platforming, bullet hell shooter sections, hacking, etc.
- High replay value with multiple endings to unlock
- Fishing

Cons:
- Not a lot of strategy in the combat, it often felt like I was just mashing buttons while my character did elaborate combos with no real thought behind it
- Bad port ""out of the box"" (fixable with mods)

If you don't mind installing the mods, then I recommend playing through this at least once (through the first ending at least).",1676835745,1676835745,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The music is incredible and is probably the next best aspect of the game after the storytelling. The song they use for the end credits is used in a rather unique way due to the multiple endings. Multiple versions of the same song that all build up to the final ending. It made the final ending feel much more conclusive to hear a familiar tune in a new light.

The gameplay itself is pretty standard hack and slash nothing overly impressive there. If anything it's a step down from its predecessor NieR:Replicant.

Steam sucks for having really in-depth reviews because of character limit, but if you're thinking about if this game is worth it or not, you'll just have to just what I say at face-value and decide for yourself. I think starting off with what is mediocre and then moving on to what I think is the best way for this.

The bad: Overleveling really trivializes the game and there are really not challenges going past level 60, the world itself isn't terribly large, there are no benefits to having a high-end PC (this is actually a good thing as well -- I'll explain later), some of the art design for the buildings in the open world seem artificial and not like they were actually a part of a long dead civilization.

The good: Standalone, it's one of the greatest stories in a video game ever told and if you've played the other Nier games and Drakengard it becomes arguably THE greatest story ever told in a video game (I think playing the entire franchise up until this point is important to really understand the full narrative being told), the characters are all charming in their own way and every time you see anyone do something whether it's main cast or side cast you think 'this character is my favorite,' there are a lot of small details that really make you nostalgic over your own life experiences, even though much of the world lacks a defining character of a long-gone civilization the atmosphere and the world itself conveys very strong sensibilities and emotions, the game looks great on the lowest settings (there is very little distinction between max settings and minimum settings), the combat isn't quite on the level of Devil May Cry but it is sophisticated enough that you can really do a lot mechanically (mods help this as there are damage reduction mods on Nexusmods where you're not just killing everything 1-2 hits), there is replayability with each ending serving a different purpose and allowing people with different life experiences and relationships to pick their favorite one by the end of their experience.

This isn't a happy game -- it is very depressing and at times nihilistic with bits of happiness spread throughout. Often times, the good things that happen to the characters are conditional or payed for down the line. Nobody gets anything for free in this world and it makes you face the reality we live in real life that things are finite and fleeting but the beauty it makes allows us to cherish these things regardless of where the journey ends. It really answers the question of whether or not it is better to have loved and lost or not loved at all.  I can't say enough good things about how compelling this game is once you play it. It's emotionally profound and the flaws you might see early on melt away the more you learn about the characters and the world they exist in.

If there's ever a time to take a risk with your money on a game you're not sure you'll like, I can't think of a better game I would bet money on would win anyone over. This should universally be considered a magnum opus for the medium.",1676542975,1676542975,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are like me, you know everything about this game derived from fanart and cosplay of 2B, then you are misinformed, same as me.
This game is not about pretty sexy android 2B, this game has a very deep story about human civilization, robot consciousness, philosophy of life and death. It‚Äôs not skin deep just like you expected from internet reaction regarding 2B and her body.  

This game has ONE OF THE BEST MUSIC ever, heavenly good, you need to play it to know, because music is intertwined with gameplay, you won‚Äôt fully understand how good the music is if you merely listen to the OST.

I won‚Äôt give his game 10 out of 10, because of mediocre graphics. Just simply saying: as a 2017 game, the graphics could be much better. 

This game is very special in the way it tells the story. After playing Nier Automata, I felt all of JRPG I played before were too predictable and simple. This game brings the story telling to a new level.

I highly recommend this game, 2B is just a cover girl for its complicated and rich story.

The graphics and OST are great and superb, but the actual game play is unpolished. The game play being an actually important part of being a game You'll be running around in the same environments fighting roughly the same monsters all the while fighting with the camera to get a good view of what is going on. Then on the second play through, you get to do it all over again, but this time with some cut scenes thrown in. 

I'd recommend just watching some youtube videos about the actual story and skip playing this yourself.",1676073963,1676073963,False,4,1,0.480118066072463989,0,True,False,False

Pros:
Gameplay: Excellent. The modality of gameplay changes creatively throughout the game. The fluidity in movement during combat is excellent. It takes sometime getting used to the bright light from a firing pod but once you do and you get used to it, you will fall in love with the combat. It is very anime like as you can flip over enemies, and teleport midmovement to dodge enemies. Its perfect. Enemies can get challenging too, this game is definitely a challenge, if you want it to. But its easy to change the difficulty also if you are having a lot of trouble beating an enemy. 

Story: Excellent. It covers some very heavy topics for a game centered around combat. You also need to continue after you beat the game to really become truly immersed to the story and gameplay, which is great since continuing the game changes a lot after you beat it the first time. 
-Philosophical deep conversation. 
-Some plot twists, and hidden images that you pick up on as you continue the game and enhance the experience. 
-There is excellent character development, and the characters are truly lovable. 

Greatest music I have ever heard in any video game and the music complements active gameplay creatively which other games do not do, and have yet to do. 

Cons:
-Sometimes the enemies (Not the bosses) can get repetitive especially when you continue after beating the game once. But I can overlook this since the enemies get new abilities, that make the game tremendously more challenging when you play it again after beating it once. 
-It forces you to use characters that you may not want to use to advance the plot, but its only temporary. 
-The open world really puts fine limitations on how far you can travel. Like an invisible wall stops you from exploring other areas. But this can be a pro if you don't like to be overwhelmed by a vastly open world.",1676070270,1676070270,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
