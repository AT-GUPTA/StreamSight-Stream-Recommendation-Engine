[b][i][u]Opinion[/u][/i][/b] (at the time of writing and biased, mainly because it's my view): 
Action and simplicity throughout proved to be a great combination for this title. Very grind-fest friendly game with a bit of story that lets you delve into the action. Controls that they allowed a 2-year old to craft as they are awkward and uncomfortable. Gameplay that is fun, fluid, constant, and quite endless. Graphical style (for NGS) was quite nice and stylish which allowed me to play (I truly dislike the graphics in the original title PSO2). The audio is fine for the title with concerts adding to already cool varied soundtrack (as you are allowed to change the music in-game via some mechanics).

No. This game was sadly ""Quarter-baked"". It won't have content to keep players interest for probably another 2 years. If the game lasts that long. Little to see, little to do. 

That's the TL;DR

There are only a handful of enemies, handful of classes. (7 atm.) Extremely limited class customization. Barely any story missions at all, and there's barely any other content to do after that. The quests are even scarce outside daily tasks. 

Sega has gone woke, and soon to be broke. Players can get permanently banned, for unclear violations. Whatever you say in game, even as a joke can result in a permanent ban. The game doesn't have very many players as is. There is no warning system. As of right now, 1,600 accounts have been banned for ""Hateful Behavior"". This game has around 3,000 players on it per day. They banned about half the current player base... 

More in depth review below. 

You will be fighting the same exact enemy list most of the game. There is very little gameplay variety. The biggest ""difference"" is if you are fighting a large robot with a sword, a large golden robot with a sword, or a rainy day purple big robot with a sword. 

No dungeons, no place to accept missions, and the ""Urgent Quests"" are only available at certain times. After awhile, players are aimlessly fighting enemies trying to level up. This gets stale real fast. Most tasks you get, you get automatically via daily tasks. You can't even choose to accept more. If you want experience to level up? You are just mindlessly fighting enemies for hours. Very few quests to accept for experience as well. 

As mentioned... you are mindlessly fighting the same enemies... This gets worse when you consider the next issue. 

Original Phantasy Star 2 had hundreds of options of different attacks, and customization. You could use what equates to magic, as well as weapon attacks together. For example, Phantom in Phantasy Star 2 could use Magic Techniques as well as its unique weapon attacks. Or you could add Phantom as your subclass to give your main class the ability to cast those techniques. 

New Genesis has almost 0 class customization. Most weapons have only 5 attacks. You have your normal attack, and 4 other attacks everyone else has. The game allows you to take your pick of a main class, and a sub class. You can mess around with a few weapon combos. That's it. Most classes are useless as sub classes. They give little to no benefit. Most interesting abilities are locked so that you can only use them if they are the main class. 

The most ""unique"" thing you can do? You can combine two weapons together. After they are combined? You can use both weapons 5 skills. You Don't have to swap weapons. You just automatically  use the weapon for that skill. You can combine a gun and a sword for example... Then set up their weapon attacks however you like. But only AFTER combining the weapons. 

Combining weapons is expensive, and only certain weapons can be combined together. This means that even if your main class and sub class have access to 6 weapons, You'll probably only use 1 or 2 weapons. You can only combine weapons that have the same name. While you can swap weapons, it would have been far more interesting to let players use all their weapon attacks together, as long as their class uses that weapon And they have that weapon equipped. . 

Which means for the most part, you are using the same 5 attacks per weapon, over and over. These 5 weapon attacks don't get stronger like they did in previous games either. 

The world is beautiful, but feels empty. The one player hub in the game? ""Central City"" is a very small player hub, with even less to do. No more personal homes for players, very small areas to socialize, and there's not even a place to pick up quests, or depart on missions. 


*Edit*
I forgot how bad premium is and how bad the market is. Adding it here.

So this is a looter based MMORPG. There is NO trading. If you want to give a friend a weapon, because their classes uses it, and you don't want/need it? 

There is almost nothing you can do. Doesn't matter if its super rare and your friend wants that exact thing. 

If you buy Premium, (DON'T) you get like 10% more exp, and 10% more money. After that? You can use the market to sell items... 

You literally need Premium to sell on the market. Every person who sells items on the market, is paying real money for the privilege. 

You could ""try"" selling the item or weapon you want to your friend. Assuming some random person doesn't it buy it before your friend does. 

Items, and crafting is expensive. Without the market, it is very hard to level up your armor and weapons. It is locked away entirely, while Sega struggles to deal with ""Real Money Trading bots"". While you are able to buy without premium, this leaves the average player with little way to actually make money in the game. There are no quests, no missions, and little way to change that.

As I said, Sega is going woke. At first they did just annoying changes. They removed the term ""Male and female"". So if you want cosmetics, you have to remember if you are ""Type 1"" or ""Type 2"". No big deal, but its a pointless annoying change. 

Then they started banning players. There's so little in the game anymore, that Phantasy Star New Genesis is more about cosmetic Gacha style fashion then anything else.

I was introduced to the series when Phantasy Star Universe was released to the West on Xbox 360 and it was AWESOME! It was one of my first experiences with online gaming! I can't believe it took me this long to jump into PSO2 when the base game finally came to the West again in 2020. I followed it for a while but I guess it fell off my radar. 

Anyway, the New Genesis (NGS) overhaul is amazing! At least what we have right now anyway. I know SEGA plans on adding more content in the future but it's really good so far! 

Jumping right into the game, you'll be introduced to one of the BEST character creators I've ever seen for a anime style game and there are a TON of cosmetics you can get later on. What's even better is that most items from base PSO2 can be transferred to NGS, allowing for a vast amount of customization! Speaking of, all cosmetics appear to be earned in a handful of ways. They can be earned through quests, the player market (if you afford it) or through scratch tickets which is the premium lootbox system. I absolutely LOVE seeing everyone's characters! There are some really interesting ideas running around!

The gameplay feels really good! Combat feels so fluid and really makes me feel like a Shonen protagonist!  Seriously, all of the animations look super appealing! There is a handful of stuff to do in NGS. Though, if it does get too redundant, there is the option to transfer to base PSO2 and there is so much to do that it's slightly overwhelming!
