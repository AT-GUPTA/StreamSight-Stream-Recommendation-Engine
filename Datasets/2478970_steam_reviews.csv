We mastered all games with 100% completion and all secrets found. Of course he also finished the remake, Legend, Anniversary and Underworld. I finished Tomb Raider 2013, and Rise of The Tomb Raider, also almost Finished Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Playing this again bought a tear to my eyes as it took me back to simpler times, when gaming was a family event and all the fond memories that I have of my son and my wife at the time just came flooding back again.

- Sometimes the keys and other items are really easy to miss in the modern look, due to a sacrifice in clarity for the sake of visuals, this is priority one to be patched.
- Modern controls suck and they knew it so they put the tank controls as default (which I respect) specially the underwater ones, those can be fixed by adding a ""swim down"" and ""swim up"" A and B respectively on the controller like Legend or Anniversary did. And the regular ones can be fixed by letting you map backstep, by letting you remap everything like the walk button, by fixing its AWFUL broken camera (you shouldn't have touched the original camera in the modern look as well, it has new bugs that it didn't use to have, it's harder to see enemies sometimes and you get this weird instant vertical snapping sometimes that is confusing)
- Worsened the controls by not allowing me to map side step to a specific button on keyboard at least, which we used Del and PgDown for. 
- You also can't change which Ctrl or Shift key you're holding down on the fly. Previously you could do it, and you wouldn't let go of ledges or you wouldn't stop walking.
- The new visuals are for the most part OK, save for the clarity thing and some parts where they did too much, or didn't do enough. There's places that kept the errors in the textures all over the geometry that DOESN'T affect the gameplay, and you can see they did an effort to solve some of these, but missed so many it's not even funny, you could've easily coded a UV grouping system into the tile texture manager to group tiles together and make the texture uniform. Obviously then they should've went over the whole thing with a fine comb. 
- There should be less fear to make it pitch black where the original game went over to make it pitch black at a relatively short distance. Like the bottom of the ocean in TR2? I could see the whole badly tiled wall behind the Maria Doria from a mile away, the original was x10 times more immersive. And that happens with the lighting in a couple instances, where the lighting does miss the mark widely entirely changing the atmosphere. Also the baked lights are super low res for some instance, making them blocky but not blocky in that they're a blocky texture from a blocky environment, but it has this low res ""stairs-like"" effect to its shadow slopes, and I can't for the life of me figure out why they didn't make them more high res, they're baked, they're textures! Sometimes the per vertex illumination of the original affects how stuff like water renders, and it's too evident, in the Venice level for isntance. The water caustics are also TOO affected by the lighting and they're only visible in full light, when in real life it doesn't happen like that, they're actually more visible in darkness, since the light washes them away. 
- That brings me to: there are times where the newer textures ARE MORE PLAIN AND LESS CONTRASTY than the original ones, resulting in a washed look, like in the City of Khamoon level's Sphinx. I know it was connected to dirt in the original too but you absolutely could add some stonework detail and some 3D, more information to that as well without messing with the gameplay surface geometry too much, you tried to do it with the Sphinx's feet, and failed in making interesting or not ugly. Then there's weird stuff like the lava, or water... and some textures like those on the bottom the circular moat on the Offshore Rig that HAVE alpha transparency in the original look, but are painted black in the modern. Someone forgot to turn on the alpha on the material.
- The human models are... weirdly toon. I don't particularly care for most of them. Some of them have this fortnite look to them that makes want to uninstall myself, and the named characters have this kinda anime look to them weirdly good looking boyish big eyed look, like Pierre or Larson for instance. I would've made them more ugly same with the italian mob henchmen. TR5 had this really good look going for them, NOT in-game, those were almost the same as TR1's, I'm talking about the FMV ones. 
- The animal models are ok for the most part, some are weirdly realistic when compared to some that look either more toony, or more similar to the original look to be anywhere near realistic, the original look had a more brutal thing to it. Also the tigers in mine have only one set of whiskers, is that right?
- The occlusion culling I THINK it's still just made with a 4:3 aspect ratio in mind. That's why sometimes prop objects like doors and stuff like that pops in and out of existence at the edges of the screen.

Now the good stuff it does on its own:

- Good interface overall, easy to access everything you want very clean and that includes remastered splashscreens. The only nitpick is the missing graphics options.
- Good updated look overall, it has some issues but it can be, I believe, very quickly improved upon by addressing what I said on the bad section. The lighting is very good most of the time. 
- Good updated character controller. Putting the TR3 CC on TR1 and TR2 was a smart move I think. It's way more accessible to play with mid air rolling and updated turning speed alone. I would like the option to switch back to that too if possible, alongside the much needed option to switch off the boss health bars. 
- Good implementation of the realtime toggle for visuals. I was impressed that you could do it mid FMV.
- Good implementation of realtime lighting. 
- Additional geometry and foliage for the most part is very good.

I also think it's important to recognize that even though this is a remaster they respect the source material so much that they went back and used most of what was there. While they did make some stuff worse, the fact that 99% of it isn't game breaking and what is is easily fixable speaks to good work, but not completely done. 

Then there's why I recommend it: 

Leaving aside the bad, it still is the original TRs I know and love, and that alongside its elusive Expansions still gets it a recommendation. 

If you can get the original ones and think the price is too steep for how little extra it gives you, but they're probably cheaper so better go for that, there's patches for anything that bothers you like it not supporting 16:9 resolutions or controllers or whatever. But you'll need to do some tinkering, and probably mess about with warez to get the expansions since they're not selling pretty much anywhere.

With the original TRs you get:

- Probably cheaper price
- The original progression between the character controller implementation between the games.
- The original look, with some missing features from the remaster like a low res background image of the game whenever you paused the game, except for TR2s tapestry in its menu, that's still there on the remasters, BUT ONLY IN THE ORIGINAL LOOK for some reason.
- You get the most responsive controls and no weird camera (well most of the time)
- You get a PAUSE BUTTON or the dreaded Save Crystals if you play the PS1 versions of TR1 and TR3
- You get NO AI UPSCALING
- You get the same awesome level design and exploration",1708906524,1708906524,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a great remaster it has it's problems, but this is definitely the best way to play the first 3 games (I like to consider Anniversary as it's own thing).

First of graphically this game looks really good it has a ps2 like charm to it in a lot of ways and the in game ways they made the levels brighter is really nice (cave roof being destroyed, chandelier lights being brighter etc.), but if you are not satisfied with the new graphics you can change them with one button, like how Halo the master chief collection did.

Secondly there are now 2 control schemes, classic controls and modern controls. 

Classic controls are your regular tank controls and as far as I know they were mostly unchanged (you can do mid-air rolls in TR1 as well, running rolls are now done with rolls instead of pressing jump etc.), but at the same time there are new moves that the game doesn't mention more on that later.

Modern controls is the brand new control scheme added to the game. A lot of people say that they are terrible and you are better off mastering the tank controls, but after doing a lot research and experimenting I strongly disagree. While unfortunately they aren't the definitive control scheme, because of it's flaws it makes the game much more easier. Vehicle sections feel like normal vehicle sections instead of elaborate puzzle sections, where you had to make sure your vehicle faces the right angle during ramps. And combat I think is a lot better, also instead of just spamming backflips and sideflips, you can now run circles around enemies, on top of doing your regular jumps and flips. The problems start when you are doing regular platforming, and they definitely need to patch things up as soon as possible. 
First of you can only do back/side flips and back/side steps, while your weapons are out, which makes you rethink a lot of platforming sections (thankfully you can still do a backflips from slopes so it's not like the game soft locks you). 
Secondly the camera, is easily the biggest enemy in the game, while you are using the modern controls, it constantly disorients you, a lot of times where you are not seeing anything it needs to be fixed ASAP. Thankfully you can reset the camera using the view button or by pressing the walk button and walking a bit, but those are sadly bandaid solutions.

Also like I mentioned previously there are brand new moves added to this remastered trilogy, some from later games and others are brand new moves, the problem is Aspyr haven't created at least an instruction manual that describes said moves. At best there is an  overview of the modern controls on their support page, but it's super barebones.

To the point I decided to make a manual myself (shameless plug):
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3162778467

The ""MODERN"" controls suck. You spend 99% of your time in the game dying because of some camera bug and 1% actually playing.
It's incredible to see the courage of these guys in bringing back the old, sexy and feminine Lara Croft, as day after day we see Lara becoming more and more... Masculine?!
Well, I hope they fix the game in the future and I hope they resolve these issues because it's a beautiful remaster, but the controls (except if you're a long-time fan) are really frustrating.

Off the bat had no issues with bugs or textures etc. This could be different for other people but I'm sure there will be fixes in the future

If you're a new player please experiment with controls! The game is based on an old grid/cube system and you might find the Classic controls work better. The Walk button is your best friend for lining up jumps and to avoid falling off ledges.  Modern controls work pretty well apart from in combat. I found it difficult to dodge and jump with guns out in modern controls. Also, there are some camera glitches in modern controls to, but they rarely happen. 

I prefer Classic controls because thats the way the game was intended to be played. Everything is spot on though. Amazing glow up, and they kept in almost everything from the OGs. So you have many options!

I have since played more with the modern controls, and despite many people disliking them, they aren't bad at all once you get used to them.

But eventually my Playstation died and and there weren't new systems being made anymore and in fact I upgraded to the Playstation 2. Which wasn't bad but eventually the Playstation 2 went the way of it's original system save? I've also bought the X-Box and Gamecube too! But one day? I looked at ALL my consoles and figured out HOW MUCH CASH I BLEW on all of them. EXPENSIVE and I can't afford this type of expense anymore but PC? Yes the system is generally twice as expensive to start with but perk? You buy a new PC when you old one dies? You simply transfer all your old games to the new PC. PC towers also have their own set of headaches but? Their flexibility makes them worth it. But Tomb Raider was one of the few Playstation games I couldn't emulate successfully on the PC no matter what emulator I used. Something game breaking always glitched IF the game would run at all.

So I was actually excited to buy this remastered version and better yet? Seems to be running flawlessly. It's almost actually painful to watch the original graphics on a Hi-Def TV! LOL. More importantly? The gameplay itself hasn't been touched and the camera going wonky occasionally in Tomb Raider? Remember this was one of the FIRST EARLY games to play in third person as the vast majority of the time? Camera works just fine.

I loved the first Tomb Raider, the second one was kind of hum ho and the final third one? WAS THE BEST easily! These classic games are easily worth $10 a pop, granted a lot of people whom never played the original Tomb Raider? Going to HATE the controls but the game was actually DESIGNED around them too. Some jumps HAVE TO BE MADE PERFECT or YOU WILL DIE. A standing jump and a running jump definitely define how far you CAN jump and it takes Lara exactly of square to hit running speed and also when you pull back? She hops EXACTLY one square back so you can get the perfect running space needed.

Well enough going down memory lane, there's a REASON Tomb Raider was so good back in it's day and with the graphics touch up to roughly today's standards? It's not an eye sore either. But if you are into games where you need instant gratification? Avoid this game like the plague. This game is about exploring and figuring out how to get from point a to b with a decent story tied to it. The creatures are more jump scares than anything else as it usually is the levels themselves that are the MOST dangerous to you. Granted, definitely don't try wrestling with a bear either! LOL.

Take it slow, be careful, explore thoroughly and you'll have a great time.

My only real issue with this remaster is the difficulty in seeing certain objects. Vital items like keys can be next to impossible to notice if you're using the new graphics. I hear they're patching this soon but it was very annoying in some levels. There's also the fact that some levels have aged better than others (the last few levels of Tomb Raider 1 are filled with fast and tanky enemies and nasty gotcha moments), but for the most part I would rather be playing this than most modern releases.

I, like many others, am not a huge fan of the three games we got from Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix, Tomb Raider has always been an exploration based puzzle solving game with combat sprinkled in for good measure, I wasn't a fan of the shift to cinematic action set pieces and cover based third person fire fights in the newer games, so when I heard this remaster  was in the works, I was ecstatic. I am happy to say, this remaster captures everything I loved about the original games, while improving the visuals immensly. It maintains the feel of the originals while boasting upgraded graphics and textures, a new lighting engine, and a new modernized control scheme (full disclosure, I haven't touched the modern control settings, Tank controls 4 life baby). Aspyr knocked this one out of the park, I can only hope Last Revelation gets the treatment these games got as well, but as it is right now, I am one happy tomb raider.

➖ Fighting fast enemies is extremely difficult because of the controls.
➖ Some keys in TR I are tiny and hard to spot.
➖ Underwater lever animation is sometimes buggy.
➖ Flares are extremely buggy.
➖ Music stops playing after re-loading the game.
➖ Terrible, low-quality sound effects.
➖ Controls, movement, and Lara's lack of aiming at two targets simultaneously make combat horrible, even on Modern Controls.
➖ Invisible ladder blocks the path in TR II.
➖ Slow aiming and shooting with AR, Lara keeps stopping shooting.

Pros:
- Add-ons included for the 3 games
- Ability to switch between old and new graphics anytime, although this seems possible only with a gamepad? Can't find the key when playing old school style with a keyboard

Cons:
- Graphical lifting is ok but could have been better, even some reworked models are glitching (i.e. Lara's braid)
- Achievements are messed up, you beat level 1 and get an achievement for beating level 2! Got 4 achievements so far and none of them is relevant to the triggering event
- Subtitles (at least FR ones) have language misspellings, even proper nouns (""Oxian dagger"", really?) and menu options are simply unintelligible in French - could have forgiven that if the games had hundred-pages long scripts but come on, we're talking about the first Tomb Raider games, this ain't some Dragon Age level here
- Last but not least, before even seeing the first image of the games, you get lectured by an opening screen talking about ""deeply harmful, inexcusable racial and ethnic prejudices"", FOR REAL? These are games released 30 years ago with a 3-lines plot. Strangely, the message does not mention any sexist stereotype, bwahaha - guess you can't please everyone. Crystal Dynamics, let's be real: you didn't ""present it in its original form [...] in the hope that we may acknowledge its harmful impact"", you did because rewriting the original material would have triggered shitstorms and reduced games' sales and profits. If your so-called ""values"" allows wasting oxygen for the sole purpose of remastering ""inexcusable"" games, then please do it in silent and don't try to disguise it as white-knight stuff while spitting on an entire generation of gamers.

The only reason why I put a negative vote is because unlike all the other people who praises the new graphics, personally I hate them. They destroy the visual clarity of the game. A lot of keys and locks are just plain invisible. 

I don't understand exactly how this could have happened during the development. Like in the cistern level for example, you took those keys, you turned them into a 3D model, thats absolutely fine, but then why the f*** do you divide their scale by 10 and gave the same color as the floor ? WHY ?

I am in the second level of Egypt and I already took 50 screenshots of absurdities like this. They did a good job in the trailer trying to make you believe that the new lighting makes these remasters look gorgeous, but in most of the rooms, it's actually dark and it makes the whole color palette bland and tasteless. When I switch between retro mode and modern mode sometimes, I really want to keep the retro mode, but they locked the framerate to make you feel like you're playing the game on PS1

I'd discourage everyone away from ""modern"" controls as the game was not designed like a modern game so playing with those controls causes tons of additional issues that weren't real issues in the original controls. ""The camera!"" is a common one I see when people play with it. The tank controls allow you to do your movements without being able to see, and the camera never gets so out of whack because it's movement is much more restricted in the original controls. Especially vertically. 

Play as it was intended. With a d-pad or keyboard, and tank controls. It'll take you getting used to either if you're new and you may as well go with the one that the game accounted for in it's entire design. 

The remaster includes the expansions, makes playing the classics on PC a lot easier, with a face lift (and I guess with a new control scheme if you so choose to torment yourself). 

The only criticisms I have thus far
- FMVs were not made new. I'm sure the budget of this was low, but it would've been cool to be able to have new FMVs for the cutscenes to switch back and forth as well. It would've just made the package feel more whole. 
- No ability to disable the boss health bars on modern graphics, I don't like it personally. It takes away the pressure and stress of boss fights to have the health bar visible. 
- NG+ is treated as a hard mode, and it should be more customizable. Save crystals return there, but I think it would be nice if you could choose to start the game with save crystals if you want to play that way. Similarly be able to choose the harder mode from the start instead of it being restricted to NG+. More flexibility would be nice.

And some glitches. Oh, and there are some lighting issues. I'm not really in the camp of disliking the lighting being more dark in *some* areas. However, there are certain onese where it's absurd. The area in Egypt where there are black panthers for example, in the first game. The two tunnels that panthers come out of are pitch black. You cannot see at all. It is ridiculous. I get that lighting works as a source in the updated graphics, but you should cheat it when the alternative is literally a pitch black void. Even in real life if we had to walk down a pitch black void our eyes would adjust somewhat. Either toss a fake crack in the wall to push light in a bit, or just cheat and make it lighter anyway. It's just bad. I like the lighting in most other areas even ones I've seen people complain about.

That said, more settings would be nice. Like lighting. I wouldn't really adjust it I don't think, but I know a lot would like the ability and it would be nice if possible to add such things. 

The music is insanely good. I'm honestly surprised, because people don't usually bring Tomb Raider up in best OSTs but I'm getting to the point where it may be one of my favorites. 

I'm overall just happy to have the real Lara Croft back. I miss puzzles, exploration, and platforming that required thought and effort and not just holding one button down as you essentially watch a cutscene of climbing animations during a set piece (if that). Traversal is a trend in gaming that needs to go away. Far far far away. It is boring. Nailing a platforming section in classic Tomb Raider is so rewarding.

The TR franchise and in particular the first tomb raider influenced so many of the modern games. The originals mostly limited to ageing consoles and secret corners of the internet modding community, are simply not convenient for to re-play easily on modern consoles and PCs for mainstream consumers. The remasters have solved that.

There is a whole generation who can now enjoy and experience where modern gaming began. Tomb Raider was arguably the first commercially successful main stream game, puzzle adventure, with a fully realised and animated 3d character controllable by players.

The remasters preserve the original titles in a sympathetic way to the original games enabling them to have continued life with the advances made in modern graphics. To be able to flip back and forth comparing the old graphics to the reworked graphics is a nice addition.

The limitations of game design and technology at the time influenced heavily what could be achieved with graphics and so the blocked puzzle adventure style was born. However the games early design puzzles and game play in many ways remain superior to modern game content. The three titles in the remaster contain mind bending problem solving, jump scares and content that to this day remain enduring entertainment.

The developers have shone a bright light on the orignal Tomb Raider legacy for modern gaming platforms and preserved these classics in their almost original form. New players and fans will able to continue enjoying the games, played as intended within the deliberate limitations that preserve the clever game play, the puzzles, the speed-run challenges, the deaths, the frustrations and smiles that the originals brought to players and have continued to do so for die hard fans, in ways that many modern games do not.

A remake was attempted with the Anniversary game but it never really captured the thrills and frustrations of the originals. Graphically it was arguably superior in visual design by comparison, in some levels, but the modern controls did not match the limitations of the original game, the forced style of graphics and game play mechanics that elevated the character of the originals to classics of their time.

A lot of work has gone into the remasters to faithfully realise and capture the essence of the original games with subtle additions and improvements to the set. The early Tomb Raiders deserve their place in modern gaming history and the careful design decisions and huge amount of work by the developers that have gone into the three remasters, enable today's gaming generation to enjoy them again, as they were originally loved and loathed by previous generations.",1708713017,1708713017,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

The only side of the game that I'm not keen on is the combat. There are times it felt like I could get into a good rhythm with dodging enemies, but more often than not it feels like your put in a cramped room with no room to manoeuvre, and combat was the only real time I ever felt frustrated with the game.

These remasters were beautifully made. They preserve the core of the games (pun intended) while enhancing visuals and audio.

Let's talk controls first since there are a mixed receptions of it. The games rely on a grid system which in combination with tank controls gives you insane precision once you get used to them. For 22 years I've known these controls so it was kinda easy to pick them up again. Besides these games are from 1996,1997 and 1998 and it shows in their controls. I highly encourage every NEW player who has never played any of the classics to learn the tank controls for an amazing time in the games. I recommend Lara's Home in either TR2 or TR3 to learn how to move around the world. Spend your time there and get used to it, you won't regret it. Modern controls remind me of Tomb Raider Legend/Anniversary but it's way harder to get movement right with them - at least that's my experience. Lara moves kinda hectic if you use modern and often that can get you killed.

Sound wise everything is polished and the acoustics are really pleasent to listen to. If you switch the graphics style to the old state, everything is as it's used to be. If you play with remastered graphics however, sound has been greatly enhanced. It feels more ambient. For Example in Lara's Home: Your steps echo in the great hall in remastered state. It just sounds beautfully.

Lara's character model looks absolutely stunning! I could never have imagined the remasters were ever going to happen and after they got announced I could never have imagined that Lara could look that beautiful with a fresh coat of paint! It's just mindblowing. They even added facial expressions during cutscenes, combat, if she goes down, etc. 
Other textures and models are done really good as well. I especially loved Natla's face and hair. She looks stunning, everyone looks stunning here!
And let's not forget lighting. It looks amazing, slight changes have been made to ceilings in some areas to simulate natural light sources and it very tastefully done. Note that if you have problems with areas being too dark, you can always switch to the 90's graphics and in some cases that can help (especially in TR1, the other two games do have torches).

And holy moly there's 269 achievements like beating any of the games with only Lara's pistols, getting ""unreachable"" pickups using freaking corner bug, some of them are just hilarious, I love it!

If you buy this collection you'll get access to the first three games of the franchise plus their bonus levels which were PC exclusive I believe when they first came out in the 90's which is absolutely bonkers, I never owned the bonus levels so this will be really fun getting into them as well!

BUT! Keep in mind that these are OLD games, they are almost 30 years old. You have to save manually if you don't want to lose a ton of progress! I cannot stress this enough, save often! If you have never played old games before, make it a habit when you pick these up, it will save (another pun) you a lot of trouble!

I cannot express the grattitude I felt for the last 2 days. Mega huge macro thanks to Aspyr,Saber and everyone else who has worked on these, you made a lot of people very happy. And of course huge thanks to the Embracer Group as well for HEARING US and for giving us what we've been asking for for years!
These games really take you down memory lane and it's just amazing seeing them polished so tastefully. 
Maybe there's even a slight chance we could get the other 3 classics remastered and polished by 2026 or so - or at least, that's what we wish at least.

Amazing games, amazingly remastered, PLEASE WE NEED MORE! 
Highly recommend picking these up!

Edit: After beating TR1 (pistols only max 86 saves) I tried New Game + for funsies and damn this is a whole other level of difficult if you stick to pistols only. The beloved blue save crystals are back on all platforms which allow you to save your progress and heal (note that all health pickups have been swapped for ammo!). These crystals and exiting a level are your only way of saving and they are rare, use them wisely! Also enemy defense and damage output have been increased so be careful. Even a bear in the first level can pose a great threat if you're not careful enough.
Another Edit: What I really like as well is that you can switch languages on the fly as you wish, which I totally missed initially. I grew up with the german versions and I like to return to them from time to time - apart form TR3 didn't like the german voice actress (all original classics on steam run on english so there was never an option without it being a hassle).

I've played every version since the original. When I heard about the Remastered version I was so excited. It sounded like they took the modern controls from Tomb Raider Legend, and Tomb Raider Anniversary, and applied them to the original game. Finally, I thought I would be able to play the original series with controls that were less frustrating, and with graphics that were greatly improved.

Yes, the graphics are much better, and I love how the developers improved the appearance of the game while still staying true to the original design. However, the controls are a mess. The modern controls make it nearly impossible to shoot enemies, and you'd be surprised by how many times you get stuck trying to complete a simple task. I'm sorry, but this is NOT the modern control system of the newer games. I play this for several hours, and I'm still struggling to make Laura do what I want.

There is a general rule that applies to most video games: If your character dies, and you blame yourself for making the mistake that caused the death, then it's a good game. However, if you blame the video game for the mistake, or the bad control implementation for the mistake, then it's not a good game. Using that criteria, this is not a good game. Sometimes I'll be trying to get away from bats or wolves, and they keep munching on me because only 1 out of 5 bullets is hitting them. Other times I'm stuck at the surface of a small pool of water, unable to dive to a greater depth. This is not an easy game to play. I'm constantly blaming THE GAME for stupid mistakes, and not myself.

Then there are a bunch of little frustrations. For example, try to quit the game. I'll bet you can't figure it out. Or, try to make Laura run fast using the dash key. Or, try to grab onto a ledge after a jump. These, and many other maneuvers aren't possible without doing web searches. The solutions are easy to find after a quick search, but why are we forced to figure them out on our own?

I think Tomb Raider Remastered has one purpose: It's to preserve the game, and to make it playable on modern hardware. It's more of an experiment than a game. I'm sorry, but I just can't imagine playing this all the way through. It'll be far too frustrating.

Here is my advice: If you want to play the original Tomb Raider with better graphics, purchase Tomb Raider Anniversary. It's a much better game, and when you make mistakes, you'll blame yourself rather than blaming the game.",1708670520,1708670520,False,2,2,0.473777532577514648,4,True,False,False

I know it's not asking much, but it's all there and I love it. This isn't to say this remaster is without its flaws, but I love it nonetheless.

Getting into specifics about its issues though: the modern camera gets impossibles at times. It really struggles in tight spaces and will make you miss jumps quite a few times. You've got unlimited saves to keep retrying these jumps, and sometimes it helps when yoy toggle old graphics on, but it's still frustrating.  

Another thing lacking with modern controls is the option do side steps, and specially back steps, for which I've had to turn tanks controls on a couple of times, because they're needed to drop into ledges. The annoying thing here is that they could very simply be assigned to the d-pad, but aren't.

I would also love it if they added a quick save and quick load button, and maybe some quick healing and weapong switching.

But as I said, I love what we got already. I've played this games a lot as a kid but never finished one. As an adult I got the classic versions on steam years ago, but never got too far on any of them because of how dated they are. Now, after 20 hours, I've finally beaten the first tomb raider. It was rough, and I had to consult playthroughs a couple of times, but it still left me wanting for more. The level design is what set these games apart and makes them stand the test of time, even if sometimes it is a little outdated. Exploring these levels is a magical thing because they are gorgeous, even with the old graphics, and they brimming with secrets that are joy to discover. The only downside to these secrets is they almost never have interesting rewards, just health packs and ammo.

I thought the modern triology was ok, but they don't quite capture the same feeling of exploration that the older games have. And the enemies you face are also very 90s rad video game like. Just in the first game you fight a t-rex, alien mummies, and a skater boy with uzis.

Anyways, I'm just rambling at this point, but that's a testament to how much I love this, that I just want to talking about it. If you're an old fan, I'm pretty sure you'll like this remaster.

Visually speaking, the balance achieved of staying true to the original texture work, mixed with 3D treatment of sprites and atmospheric effects is commendable. The ability to quick-swap between the classic and modern visuals is an appreciated inclusion. There are also a few quality-of-life control inclusions such as roll-jumping being added to the first game and flipping out of crawl spaces in TR3. I do have a few control gripes with TR1 vs the original PC version, but these are borderline unnoticeable to general players.

Ingame graphics have been upgraded perfectly.
The original gameplay has been preserved.
FMV's are lazily implimated with AI upscale.
Modern controls are awful and will turn away new players. [b] Play on Tank Controls! [/b]

Almost a perfect Remaster. It does exactly what I would want from a Remaster, updating the visuals without changing the gameplay. 

[h2] Graphics [/h2]
The ingame visuals are perfectly done. All textures have been improved, the lighting is beautiful and original Lara looks superb. You can even switch between the old and new visuals on the fly with the push of a button/key. Just Like in the Command & Conquer Remaster

They've even took some liberty's and changed some of the levels so the lighting improvements make more sense. None of these changes effect gameplay or the layout of the levels and are expertly implemented

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
The gameplay hasn't been changed much, which is a good thing as it preserves the original feel of the game. However in Tomb Raider 1, Lara now has the ability to jump and flip midair, which was an ability that she got in Tomb Raider 2. It doesn't really change much drastically but it does allow at least one secret area to be reached more easily.

There's also a new Photo mode which I've had tons of fun using. You can select some preset facial expressions and pose's as well as reposition the camera around lara in anyway you choose. It's really neat.

[h2] FMVs [/h2]
The FMV's haven't been touched at all, the devs just copy and pasted in the originals and AI upscaled them. I personally would have appreciated a remake of these FMVs to match the quality of the rest of the game. The subtitles in these sequences look like a mess due to the aforementioned AI upscaling. Just completely lazy.

[h2] Mordern Controls  [/h2]
The new ""Mordern Controls"" are dreadful, this remaster would have been better of without them, and since they're the default control scheme, people who are new to these games are gonna have a frustrating experience.

Pro -Updated graphics including all 3D models updated/higher res textures/lighting all work well to generally adhere to the original art design.  The update to the lighting made great use of the flares
Con -The con to this, some of the updated textures look a bit ""plastic"" and kinda ruins how it works in the environment: EX: Underwater levels in TR2 some ""rusty"" textures/items look like plastic.  Some of the original textures that used 2D items like lamps; some were made into 3d objects, others were just left as 2D high res textures; just a minor consistency complaint.  With the update to the graphics system, a lot of other room pop ins occurred a lot especially in TR2.  TR2 needs the most refining.  Some areas received a lot of love of updated environments: EX plantlife, etc while others were left pretty much the same just with pretty textures.

Pro -All of the content was included in this release including bonus levels/expacs/ and some cut content.
Con -TR3 bonus level did not trigger for 60/60 secrets for TR3; not sure if this is a bug or if they included additional criteria to trigger the level in comparison to the original release criteria to trigger the bonus level.

There are other minor issues that occurred throughout the game, a few game-breaking issues that required a reload of the level, but the drastic improvement over the original issues is definitely a plus in my book.  I used to build levels part of the TRLE community.  Working on the original code of this engine is no easy task.  

I will say, this should have been given one-to-two more quality test-plays before releasing.  Is this remaster worth $30?  The value-to-content ratio is hard to measure as this style of game is not for everyone; especially those who did not enter gaming during the 90's era.  This game collection is difficult to master as a completionist.  However, if you do get use to the controls and play style, you will be entertained for HOURS with LOTS of replayability through the new achievements you can get.  If you are on the fence of getting this collection, just be aware, it does need some polishing, but it is NOWHERE near as bad as the original releases were.  Its really fun overall and I REALLY hope TR4 and TRC get the same love.

1 - Textures. This is the most annoying part. Most of them aren't seamless. Others are rotated or mirrored wrong. Others are too stretched. I know these were mistakes of the classic versions, but in the remaster? Really? These need to be fixed.

2 - The sound effects, specially for TR2 (which are very low quality) need to be remade for the remastered mode. They're far too old and don't hold up to today standards.

3 - Modern controls. They are very promising, but still need more work, specially in combat mode where it's terrible to stay away/dodge from enemies and shoot at the same time, plus jumping should be more responsive. The more the controls look close to LAU trilogy, the better.

4 - Some features aren't necessary, but they would sure be welcome, like inventory backgrounds in the remastered mode, outfit selection and a level select/replay option.",1708572294,1708572294,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beyond that the remastered graphics strike a good balance between blocky and increased fidelity, atmosphere. The only issue is that lighting can be a bit too dark in some areas and some of the new item models, especially the keys can blend into the environment. Thankfully with a press of a button you can swap to the old graphics. I feel like they could have given Lara an optional flashlight and maybe added a glint effect to the items.

The modern control option is appreciated and makes the game more accessible but unfortunately the modern camera tends to get stuck in tight areas which makes the controls almost unusable when very tight platforming is required. I'd recommend just getting used to the tank controls because your given a lot more precision and the levels were made for the classic camera. But if they fix the modern camera I'd definitely use the modern controls more.

If you're someone who has dabbled in AI image upscaling (ESRGAN etc.) yourself, you'll absolutely be able to spot the tell-tale artifacts. The new textures also tile very poorly which feels careless. These textures about on par with what you'd see in something like Morrowind Enhanced Textures (which AI upscales Morrowind's textures) which is neat... for a free mod made by amateurs. (And the textures in that mod do tile properly, mind you.) For a £20 professional remaster I'd expect something more carefully done. The redone models here are pretty good, so clearly Aspyr does have some artists working at the company.

Also it would be excellent if the classic models and textures could be combined with the high-frame rates and new lighting.

The total lack of graphics settings is also crazy.

But Tomb Raider was the first true 3D game i ever played.
Took long enough to learn to move in multiple directions rather than just left, right, forward, back.
Tomb Raider became my main game to play.
Over the years i completed every possible move, secret, everything but the cheats.
I can honestly say i never used any form of cheats, and i never used a walkthrough.
Everything i learned the hard way.

Now this remaster is practically as good as the originals.
Very glad they kept a lot of the bugs in the game and did not change story or dialog at all.
Makes it even more special.
Still play all the original Tomb Raider games even to this day but the main setback with dos games is they tend to crash a hell of a lot.
So it was very enjoyable to for once be able to play a whole game without having to restart the game after each crash and repeat all the progress till my last save.
I personally think they an exellent remaster of the games.
I know some people complain about the modern controls don't work perfectly but considering its age and considering they used the original code from the original games well.
I'm blown away by how good they have managed to update it all yet still feel almost original.
Personally i am so used to the tank controls i use tank controls to play these remasters and have no problems at all.
Anyone that played or even likes the original trilogy, i would 100% say buy this set.

Modern controls don't fit well to the design of these games but I see it more as a bonus. You can always switch back to classic controls. 

It is really nice that you can switch to classic graphics on the fly. It really shows how they changed the environment. I think every remaster should have this feature.

It's great that they include all add ons since these are hard to get... They are not on steam.

Also it's not full price. This has to count something nowadays.

For me there is little to complain about. I have the feeling the classic mode runs worse than in the old steam release, but maybe it just feels this way due to immediate comparison with new graphics.

There are a number of features that have practically been left untouched, including the original sounds and fonts. Even the cut scene animations are virtually unchanged— character models still do the silly head-bobbing thing when they talk even though their mouths are fully animated. However, there are definitely reasons to get the remasters instead of just playing the old games, so I'll list those below.

Things I like about the remasters:
- The lighting effects overall have vastly been improved, especially in Tomb Raider 1. The Tomb of Qualopec doesn't hurt my eyes quite so bad anymore.
- Some sky effects have been added to certain areas of Tomb Raider 1, including the Lost Valley and Coliseum levels. This is a good thing in my opinion.
- Some quality of life features have been added to the game, including a modern control scheme and action indicators (!) that tell you if something can be interacted with.
- You can lock the butler in the freezer. And he actually freezes.

A few shortcomings (as of the time of this review):
- There are more than a few texture glitches and oddities that haven't been fixed yet, most notoriously the random paintings that appear in some underwater sections.
- The game tends to freeze for a second or two when music cues are triggered. Not game breaking in any capacity, but the lag can be frustrating sometimes. Of course, it might just be my computer, but the game runs just fine at any other time.
- The pre-rendered cut scenes were upscaled and not very well. The on-screen text especially has a grainy texture and was not cleaned up at all. Not particularly important, but just an FYI that they do not represent the quality of the remasters.

Overall, though, I'd say the remastered Tomb Raider is definitely worth checking out. If you haven't watched any gameplay and are undecided about it, I'd recommend doing that first before buying.


PS: If you're a newbie, this is just a reminder that the original games came out in the late 90s and have some content, including racial and ethnic stereotyping, that would be considered unacceptable by today's standards.

All I really wanted was decent controller support so that I do not have to dust off my old consoles.

I have not tried the new control system, and probably won't because tank movement is my comfort zone.

For the audacity of putting out such a shoddy control scheme I wasn't recommending this at first. Controller will give you a bad time and put you in a bad mood.

Texture work is pretty terrible in some places, seams everywhere, textures are not tiling. It looks like patchwork and very jarring. Overall though, it does a good job 80% of the time. There are some pros and cons to everything:
- Textures, look nice but often don't tile and look more like a bad Minecraft HD mod
- Lighting is great but can change the atmosphere drastically. You never get the feeling of being underground as there are holes everywhere to get light in.

Yes YOU ARE standing behind that because youre getting money for remaking exactly such scenarios and your excuses are simply very shallow and contradictory after all.

I wanna highlight my personal feelings as a longterm player as well about that. So when youre greeted with basically an implication of the team stating that theyre not proud of their product, not confident in its presentation and that they feel ashamed, i as a player kinda feel the same going into it. My mood just goes downhill right away. I wanna see compassion, love and dedication from developers, not dull excuses and negative vibes.

Furthermore you seemingly banned a mod which skips that particular text, which is hilarious imo. 

All in all im not gonna support your product if you behave in such a way and im recommending any other (upcoming) developer to not take an example of that. We dont WANT and dont NEED such topics/statements and vibes in videogames. It destroys any immersion right away. If you feel the urge to talk about such game designs just post on social media, but after all i think such discussions are absolutely unneccessary because its simply a sort of artstyle and artdesign, even loredesign if you want so, that the makers had in vision.

I've loved these games for a very long time, and I am super excited that they got the love and attention that they deserve, and so all of the people who are newer to tomb raider (and played the survival games) can see what Lara was actually about in the good ole days. That being said, I have some things I love and don't like so much about what they've done here.

LOVE:
- I absolutely love that they tried to stay as true to the original as possible, and left most things as they were.
- I love how they redesigned the assets and made things much more lively than in the original whilst keeping the game's overall charm.
- This will probably only be a plus for those of use who are already familiar with the game but I absolutely love the tank controls and I don't think the game would be playable if I wasn't able to use them.
- I love how I can change back to the original graphics whenever to compare (or for some light)
- It's cool that I can play the first game now because I've never been able to do all the fancy stuff you have to do to these newer computers to run it so I've played 2-6, and my only experience with the first game was through TRAnniversary.
- Overall, I'd recommend this game for anyone who has or hasn't played it, but like i said, it's definitely going to be challenging if you're not used to the controls.

Don't Like so much:
- All things being said, while I find the tank controls to be fine and dandy, the modern controls do not work very well with these games, especially in terms of platforming and combat. I received these as a gift on playstation, and it was abysmal trying to work with the modern controls, and if I'm being honest, I'm not sure there's a way to make that better.
- In the original games, you were able to adjust the ""gamma"" or the brightness for the game, and there are some places in the game where it is way too dark and there's no way to brighten it up. Switching back to the original graphics helps in most cases, but not in all cases. It would be nice if that feature could be brought back.
- I noticed this most in TR2, but whenever you are climbing a ladder or something of that nature, they tried adding a dynamic effect that is a little tough on the eyes. I often switch to the original graphics when I need to climb. 

As I said before, solid games, super happy with what they've done, and I'm excited to finish them all! Thanks guys!

finally we can play again as the lara like she should be.
This remaster is very good. Probaply one of the best remasters out there. But still there are some things that arent perfect.

- First the most obvious change. The graphics. They are perfect. I wish that every remaster would be like this. The graphics are drasticaly improved in every aspect, but they capture the feeling and stile of the classic game perfectly. When playing on Controller and Keyboard you can easily and seemles switch between classic and improved graphics on the go without a loading screen. There are many nice effects added like shells ejecting from the weapon, which leave water ripples when they fall into a body of water. Very nice

- When it comes to sounds and voices its pretty much the same as the classic games. Which is perfect in my opinion

- The controls are not that perfect. Of course the classic tank controls work perfectly and are the same like they used to. Sadly the new modern controls suck. They are missing important moves from lara. If you use them, you basically are missing out on 40% of laras moveset and animation which is very weird. But luckily the classic controls arent that bad.

- There are a lot of achievements. Achievement hunter are going to be very satisfied. The different achievements also need you to play the game differently, which gives the different titles replayability.

- I havent encountered a bug or a crash yet. The game seems to run very smooth

I think thats all that comes to mind right now. Bubye",1708434255,1708434255,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Still, I'm disappointed. It's very pretty from afar but overall it doesn't add much to what the community has been working on for years now. They didn't go far enough. I opted for a refund even though I guess I could have waited for the first updates.

The negative:

- Ugly AI-upscaled FMVs, and sometimes with the wrong aspect ratio. There are many fan-made upscales out there that are much better.
- Typos, grammar mistakes and timing issues in the subtitles.
- For some reason they didn't remaster the SFX. I don't mind the compressed sound when playing the originals but here they really feel out of place with updated graphics. That's another thing fans are able to do with automated processes or AI, so I don't get it.
- No chapter access. Adding achievements is fun but it clashes with the archaic system of not having access to chapters to replay it each time you have completed it once. I know they wanted to keep the look of the old menus but this needed a compromise. Having to have manual saves ready in case you want to go back to get an achievement is nonsense. See the current version of Half-Life for a great modern menu that works with an authentic okd game.
- Many models have glitchy animation, and the characters still shake their head when they speak. This was made to compensate the lack of facial animations, just like heavy makeup in silent movies to compensate the absence of the actors' voices. Now that facial animations have been added, the head shaking doesn't make sense. This is due to the fact that you're essentiallly playing a reskinned TR that you can switch from to the classic version, so it seems to be just a limitation.
- I'm used to the tank controls and don't care about the modern ones but many players legitimately complain about their implementation. I don't get how you wouldn't help players use their preferred controls if you want to woo a new generation. This should imply many changes in many levels, so if you can't implement it fully, just don't.
- No graphics settings. The games are very dark, and I had to override the antialiasing myself because there's none. Just because it's an old game doesn't mean it can't have graphics settings, especially on PCs that are all different as opposed to uniform console software. In a fan-made game there'd be plenty of things to tweak.

The positive:

- The games have been on Steam since 2012, so I didn't get right away the nostalgia overload for the PC players as if the games were lost up until now. Indeed they need to be patched to be fully enjoyable and not everyone is able to tinker with game files, so it's great that the games are playable again out-of-the-box for everyone. It's even better for console players.
- The overall look. As I said it's very pretty:
+ The newly-made models and facial animations are fresh.
+ The lightning is great. Dominant colors are reflected on everything. Draw distance is expanded.
+ The upscaling and redoing of the world textures is convincing. The upscaling seems to have been corrected by hand, as opposed to the botched GTA upscaling.
+ The newly added vegetation in the outdoors brings a lot of life to levels that were rather barren on that regard. TR3's India levels are the ones that benefit the most from this.
 + The attention given to remaking faithful loading screens from scratch is top-notch in contrast to the botched work on the FMVs.
- Achievements and a photo mode are always fun. It's not particularly necessary, especially if the game still has room for improvement.
- Being able to play a polished and faithful classic version and being able to switch between the two on the fly is very good.
- Nostalgia is also strong in foreign countries that have dubbed dialogue. All localizations are there by default, it's perfect.
- Since the core of the game wasn't changed, the often useful corner bug is still there!
- Changing the sound when Lara is barefoot is also a nice addition.

You get TR 1, 2, and 3, and the ""dlc"" missions that I believe never came to consoles, and were only on special edition pc versions. You can save anywhere, use original controls or modern ones. 

Now for the controls

As someone who played all of these as they released back in the 90s, the original controls still work totally fine if you understand how the game works on a grid. The modern controls got a lot of flak, but I feel people misunderstood them. As an old school TR vet, it just took about 10 minutes to get used to them...that's with literal decades of muscle memory to the contrary. 

If I can make it any easier, change walk to the ""shift"" key, and the single most important change you need to get used to, is that the jumps still function on a grid, you can't just run and jump randomly with modern controls. The real trick is to walk to an edge as usual, but hold right mouse to draw weapons, then tap back. That will give you the same backstep as the classic controls, this is absolutely required to understand modern controls. My only issue is that in some tight areas, you still need to use the button to look around, instead of just free looking with the mouse.

But once you get it down it feels good to use the new controls, and if you don't like them you can switch back to the old controls. The only annoyance is that the camera freedom with modern controls sometimes flips out in cramped spaces. There's also a ton of achievements and new game+ modes for replayability

Also this is a very faithful remaster graphically, down to like each individual texture and model is very intricately recreated from scratch. And it's fun to switch between the old and new graphics in real time, which even works in cutscenes, menu and wherever.

The newly added ""Modern controls"" has some serious issues with the camera to the point that it could be considered unplayable in some areas. I woudn't recommend anyone to play with this control scheme until they fix that, but other than that, you can get quite used to the Modern controls in the long run and can be sometimes better than Tank controls in some situations especially at combat and just moving around in general, while Tank controls will work better for more precise lineups.

With that out of the way, this remaster is everything that the classics fans ever wanted, same gameplay and level design but with redone textures, models and lighting, as well as having the expansions for each game, all into one package. This version also features subtitles for all cutscenes and in-game dialogues, and a new ""Camera mode"" which can be enabled during gameplay, but it can also be abused to find secret items out of Lara's field of view (not really a big deal). A New Game+ option is also included and will be available after you beat the games and it works like a ""Hard mode"". Another great addition is the option to toggle between the original and remastered graphics with the press of a button (""Start"" on a controller and ""F1"" on keyboard).

First, let us talk about the elephant in the room: the graphical improvements. They are really sweet, but do not take away from the original games. In that sense, it respects the originals and only improves upon them. Indeed, the somewhat ""cartoonish"" style of Lara Croft and other models is present. Same goes for the environments, such as the water, which looks good, but not so realistic as to waste the tone of the game. In-game cutscenes are a joy to watch, as the old animations are still present, even with the new graphics, resulting in wacky but funny hand placements and head bobbing. The FMVs have been upscaled and cleaned (probably using AI techniques), which I love as I did not want to see them replaced by new cutscenes which would have maybe taken away from the original content. The new lighting system does wonders and changes the tone of some scenes, in most part for the better. Some environmental changes had to be made to allow for more coherent and consistent results.

The inclusion of all the expansions is brilliant, as it was previously hard to:
- get them
- get them to run (next to impossible without patches on windows, and with limited success for Linux players like myself)
Linux players will be pleased to know that the whole trilogy and the expansions run flawlessly (I tested it using my steam deck, with 30FPS or more in 4K).

Sounds have also been revisited. Indeed, they get muffled when the camera is underwater, and some echo can be heard at some points, such as the clock in TR2's Croft manor echoing through the main hall. This is a blast and does not changes the game too drastically.

Apart from the inclusion of the expansions, the best feature IMO is to be able to switch back to the old graphics. It is really interesting to see the difference, at anytime, anywhere, even whilst using photo mode with a simple press of a button/key. Talking about photo mode, it is really permissive and allows you to revisit areas you've gone through in the case they are not locked. That is ideal to identify missed items for those of us trying to get all achievements (a few of them requiring the player to collect all items in the game).

Some of the achievements can be challenging, even for hardened players. In any case, you will need more than one playthrough of each game and each expansion to be able to get them all.

For the fans, the devs acknowledged our favourite bugs into some achievements, such as the corner bug. They could have patched it, but instead played with it. This is exactly what I was looking for. Some of them were patched instead, such as the last secret from TR1 being counted when you've picked up all the others beforehand. 

I have not tried the modern controls just yet, as I am used to the tank controls. Check the community for more detailed information about them. When it comes to tank controls, they work exactly as they did on the originals. Again, this gives the player a perfect control over how they want to play. The community is already discussing ""hybrid controls"", which I would advise looking into if none of the above suit you.

Some moves from next installments have also been added, which is simply both a nice improvement and a nod to maybe future remasters of TR: The Last Revelation and TR: Chronicles.

After being flooded with nostalgia during the India level, a warm feeling of enjoyment during Nevada, I started the London missions and immediately remembered something I had sealed away in the back of my mind. Tomb raider is an extremely frustrating game, and I think we were all blinded by nostalgia. You WILL need a walkthrough to get through this - and if you say you finished the London levels without looking anything up, I simply don't believe you; Parts of the wall you can shimmy across with no discernible texture difference to any other part of the wall, extremely precise pixel perfect jumping puzzles which only get worse in Antarctica which usually result in instant death if you fail. Save after every single step of progress kids, it's the 90s again. Autosaves are for losers. And let's not forget the buttons that flip your camera to some entirely unknown segment of the map that you'll be stumbling around looking for and backtracking for 20 minutes before realising you CAN shimmy past those cracks in the wall that look like they seal together and wouldn't let you do that

However, despite my gripes with the game mechanics and level design that have made me lose my shit since i was about 4, this is an extremely faithful and well made remake. I can only give it a thumbs up for how nice it has been to go through TR3 without it looking like it's running on powerpoint.

What had helped was that it had been brand new and overall quite fresh and full of 3D - and that it'd delivered.

It'd been the perfect fodder for the raise of 3D accelators too, being one of those killer apps that pushed the technology. I especially remember the first TB so strongly and cleary because I got it already before I put a Matrox Mystique (Voodoo 1 followed later) into my old trusty DOS machine. I had to play TB at 320x200 at first while it still was running quite roughly. But then - after installing the first accelarator card I ever got my hands on, it'd simply blown me entirely away. It was a revelation about what specialized silicon can do for you, now playing at 640x400 with ""redonkolous"" high framerates was possible. This was a boost I've never have had experienced before, it was freaking amazing, I still feel the heat in my face.

But I'm disgressing. For me this remaster is great, I got all three original Tomb Raider games for just a few bucks (though also missing the 4th one), updgraded to run on my current machine without almost any issues. The only one was that I had to restart windows, before that the game did stutter a bit (at least one reported more severe problems before restarting). Now it runs smooth as f* on my ultrawide display @ 3840x1600. On a 11700k with 32GB and a RTX3090. From a SSD. While running a ton of other stuff in the background, like an entire IDE because I'm some IT guy myself. - Okay, okay - keep on topic. So no technical issues at all so far, but I'm still into TB 1 and hope for the best myself.

This remaster stays ultimately true to the originals and if you don't want to adopt, don't want to go *that* far back in time, where games were still run in MS-DOS mode and mouse controls were still a thing of the far future, than I fear it's almost certainly not made for you. 

I personally can rememeber the opposite effect actually - when they ditched and replaced the old controls with its more modern counterpart.I'd been quite sceptic about this and it felt quite strange to me at first - but then I just got used to it quite fast, especially since I was already used to using WASD + mouse when TB Legends came out.

So for me today it also isn't in any way so easy to switch back to the old style. Though I think I have the advantage of *knowing* that I'd become really good back then, so much so that it just had felt naturally to me moving Lara around these tombs. TB III and IV had been critisized for beeing quite tough and actually unfair when they came out - but that is not what I remember. Lara died a thousand deaths, no question, but I got happily to the end of every game and had been actually sad about it. The TB games, besides all other classics, are just ones of these for me that I'll never ever forget. I loved and played every one of them - with the exception of one, I hated that too.

You won't believe me now I guess, if I tell you that I'm nowhere near the ""git gud"" crowd. Never have been, never will be. Today I'm 48 and trying to ""stay gud"" at my real profession everyday and this is already hard enough, I don't need much more of challange beyond that, especially not im my free time. I've become a fat and lazy sucker.

But only after a few hours playing I already start getting used to the original controls again and it feels already satisfying and quite rewarding, I garantee you that. Just give it a real chance, if you're really eager to find out how it actually had been playing it - you'll get the real experience. It plays precisely just it had been played a gazillion years ago (imho), with all its pain and pleasure. You will feel lost in the tombs in the beginning, helpless, vulnerable and quite confused, but when you come out again, you will feel like a true effing adventurer, having something accomplished that makes you feel awesome.It's pure and straight forward like a punch in your face.

All the experience I had back then is fully preserved. And I'm effing loving it regardless of the fact that I'm still hitting my bonehead hard against every wall I can find. But I'm getting better with every hour. Just don't think about it. Try. And try again. Until you get it. Then you get into the *zone*. Simply put, it's the same kind of ""magic"" a lot of these retro 8Bit games are about - which I actually don't like that much. But - Lara had stolen my heart long ago. I simply cannot resist, I must follow her call.

Okay, looks like I'm writing an entire essay already. Lets focus on the tech and graphics. Unfortunately it looks like a quite simple upgrade, no question, and I have no idea how much had to be done to port the old levels into a more modern engine and so on, but it's never so simple as it seems, I'll give the team that. But regardless - I'm somewhat disappointed too and think, a lot more could have been done, like the use of more advanced shaders and better light effects and shadows and such, while still sticking with the original design. And the fact that all these new shiny textures align as bad as the original ones is something I don't think is a feature. It's just - well, not nice. It makes the remake feel rushed overall and yes, looking at certain textures I also get the impression that at least some of them just got upgraded with the help of AI. But I don't know it better on the other hand, so I stop here.

But I'm fine with it, for roughly 30 bucks (EU) I get the chance to play TB 1 to 3 again - and at least for me, it is worth every penny already.But I'm an old fart, who cares. ;-) Love it or hate it, I don't care either.",1708379461,1708379461,True,1,0,0.507575750350952148,0,True,False,False

I have been anticipating this game for about half a year and was so glad when it finally unlocked today. The graphics are visibly upgraded and redone, and it was done in a way that for the most part keeps the atmosphere of the original game. Added bonus points for the possibility to switch to the original graphics with the click of a button. This feature works as easily and flawlessly as shown in the trailer. 

The attention to detail is staggering; from the meticulously restored graphics to the inclusion of all expansions and secret levels, every aspect oozes dedication and passion to the origins of the franchise, those games that started it all. I have come across some odd sound effects when Lara is climbing along a wall in Tomb Raider 1. It does not sound like climbing along a wall but makes a weird sound. I am not sure whether that's on purpose or a bug, but I can definitely live with it. 

EDIT: I am now 20+ hours into the game and have played through all of TR1 and a lot of TR2 and I have to say, there are some flaws in the graphics. Some areas are so dark in the remaster that they are practically black and I had to switch to the old graphics to see the collectibles in the niches. The same thing occurred in the Greece levels in TR1 where some key are so similar in color to the background that they become practically invisible unless you know they should be there and thus know what to look for. (Or you - again - switch to the old graphics.)
In some of the Egypt levels the colors seem to have too much of a reddish hue. 
These are all minor issues for old players who know the games in their original form but for new players I imagine this can get very frustrating if you cannot find items that are vital to level progression. I am hoping all of this will get fixed in future patches, though. 

I am playing the games with the old tank controls, so I cannot comment on what's going on with the modern controls that some reviewers criticize. The old controls work perfectly and to me, they make the most sense as I have learned the game like that and it seems to me that the core mechanics of the game are not very compatible with modern day controls.

I LOVE Tomb Raider. Specially those first 3 games. To me, the series kinda went downhill after TR5. And it was almost ruined by the 2013 reboot.

TR1, 2 and 3 are, to me, the best games in the series, and while they are still playable nowdays with tweaks. But when I heard about those reboots, I was VERY happy, but also a little worried.

Now that I payed it, I can say that this is EXACTLY what I wanted: modern reboots of my 3 favorite TR games, with better graphics (but without looking like a full remake), the same tank controls as before (you CAN also use the modern controls if you want. I prefer tank controls myself) and the exact same games, only with a new coat of paint, new textures, new character models and new weather effects.

The new character model for Lara is great, looking exactly how I expected her to look back in the MS-DOS era (but didn't back then due to limitations). Plus, they added some new effects, like snow falling in some open areas in the first level. Fog now looks better, same for shadows.

Is this a perfect reboot? Nah. Some things ARE off, like some bugs and how some textures seem blurrier than others. But honestly? This is like playing the originals, but without having to deal with Open Lara, Dosbox or OS incompatibilities. So yes, it was worth every cent. ^^

.

BTW, if you played the originals of PC like me, I'm happy to say that this remaster, while based on the PC version for the most part, includes the music from the PS1 and Saturn versions. For the ones that don't know, the PC version didn't have the short music that plays at some points, having only the ambiance tracks. The console versions had both ambiance tracks and musical cues.

[b]MODIFIED REVIEW WITH WORKAROUNDS
RESEÑA MODIFICADA CON ALTERNATIVAS[/b]

Let me say, there's only [b]positive[/b] or [b]negative[/b] review on Steam, and first of all, this is a great remaster. It keeps all the level design untouched and adds really nice textures, lighting, leaves and a lot other 3D stuff that before where just sprites or textures of different color. That part is perfect. But at this stage there're [b]two huge problems[/b] that they need to fix or otherwise is just a version of TR1, 2 and 3 that runs on modern hardware. I read about some people complaining about the darkness with new dinamic lighting making to hard to spot some collectables. To me that's okey. After all, they suppose to be hidden.

[b]1 - [u]The modern controls[/u]:[/b] Simply impossible to make a lot of movements with this control scheme. Is nice for general navigation and combat, but even the tutorial in Lara's mansion is absolutely impossible to finish (the way she tries to teach you how to do it). For example, you can't do a step back and hang on a ledge with modern controls. I think that the only thing they need to add is an action that when you press it she doesnt move and that will make possible to do something so simple like the step backwards. Of course, you can always go back to the [b]Tank Controls[/b] and all the movements are there to navigate, but that implies [i]pause > go to the menu > find controls > change it to tank[/i] and then the same steps to go back to modern. At this stage, the only way to play it well is with [b]Tank Controls[/b]. And I must say the obvius: It's a damn tank.

[i][b]Workaround using modern controls:[/b] If you keep the right trigger down it will always act as an action button letting Lara hang from ledges. If you need to do a step backwards for running and jumping, rolling gives you the same running distance. Alternatively (tks Schopenhauerian) if you draw your weapons you can also do a step backwards. Or, more complex, tap look around button, mantain backwards stick and tap again look around button and Lara will do a step back.[/i]

[b]2 - [u]The camera with remastered visuals[/u]:[/b] So, this is a big one. I have no idea how can they fix this. When you change to remastered visuals the camera change to. Maybe fix this is so simple as to make the camera angle and movements in remastered version the same as the original version. Oh! Snap! It was really easy to fix it. Why the hell they don't have the same camera? Even if you try to look around, most of the time you can't see where you are going. This is speacially frustrating in most of the jumps... wich means that it is specially frustrating in almost all the game. Thankfully pressing the start/menu button changes graphics back and fort and corrects the camera angle. So this means that there's no way to play with full modern graphics, you'll need to change to old, make the jump and then go back to modern.

[i][b]Workaround using modern graphics:[/b] Pressing two times the look around button resets the camera angle to Lara´s back. In most cases this solves the akward camera angle in jumps and other critical moments.[/i]

So, in conclussion, at this point the only way to play this game is with tank controls and old visuals.

[url=https://i.imgur.com/rLmQxaw.png]Old Graphics Camera[/url]

Primero déjenme decirles que solo es posible poner reseñas [b]positivas[/b] o [b]negativas[/b] en Steam, y antes que nada, este es un gran remaster. Mantiene el diseño original de niveles y agrega lindas texturas, iluminación, hojas y un montón de otras cosas en 3D que anteriormente eran sprites o texturas de diferente color. Esa parte es perfecta. Pero en este punto [b]hay dos grandes problemas[/b] que necesitan arreglar o de otro forma es solo una versión de TR1, 2 y 3 que corre en hardware moderno. Leí acerca de algunas personas quejándose de la oscuridad con la iluminación dinámica haciendo que sea difícil ver algunos coleccionables. Para mi eso esta bien. Después de todo, se supone que estén ocultos.

[b]1 - [u]Los controles modernos[/u]:[/b] Simplemente es imposible hacer un montón de movimientos con este sistema de control. Esta bien para navegación general y combate, pero inclusive el tutorial en la mansión de Lara es absolutamente imposible de finalizar (de la manera que ella intenta enseñarte como hacerlo). Por ejemplo, no podes hacer un paso atrás y colgarte de un borde con los controles modernos. Pienso que lo único que necesitan agregar es una acción que cuando lo presionas ella no se mueve y de esa forma es posible hacer algo tan simple como dar un paso atrás. Por supuesto, siempre puedes volver a los [b]Controles de Tanque[/b] y todos los movimientos están ahí para navegar, pero eso implica [i]pausa > ir al menú > encontrar controles > cambiarlos a tanque[/i] y luego hacer los mismos pasos para volver a los modernos. En este punto, la única manera de jugar bien es con [b]Controles de Tanque[/b]. Y debo decir lo obvio: Es un maldito tanque.

[i][b]Alternativas usando el control moderno:[/b] Si mantienes el gatillo derecho presionado siempre actuara como el botón de acción permitiendo que Lara se cuelgue de cualquier borde. SI necesitas hacer un paso atrás para tomar carrera y saltar, hacer un roll te da la misma distancia de carrera. Alternativamente (gcs Schopenhauerian) si sacas las armas podes hacer un paso atrás. O, mas complejo, presiona el boton para mirar alrededor, manten el stick para moverte hacia atrás y volve a tocar el botón para mirar, eso hará que Lara de un paso atrás.[/i]

[b]2 - [u]La cámara con los gráficos remasterizados[/u]:[/b] Así que, esta es una muy importante. No tengo la menor idea de como pueden arreglar esto. Cuando cambias a los gráficos remasterizados la cámara también cambia. Quizás para arreglar esto es algo tan simple como que el angulo y el movimiento de la cámara en la versión remasterizada sean los mismos que en la versión original. Oh! Rayos! Era muy fácil de arreglarlo. Por que demonios no tienen la misma cámara? Incluso si tratas de mirar alrededor, la mayor parte del tiempo no podes ver hacia donde vas. Esto es especialmente frustrante en la mayoría de los saltos... lo que quiere decir que es especialmente frustrante en la mayor parte del juego. Por suerte presionando el botón start/menu cambia los gráficos a viejos y viceversa y eso corrige el angulo de la cámara. Esto quiere decir que no hay forma de jugar por completo con gráficos modernos, necesitas cambiar a los viejos, hacer el salto y luego volver a los modernos.

[i][b]Alternativa usando los gráficos remasterizados:[/b] Presionando dos veces el botón para mirar alrededor se reinicia el angulo de la cámara a la espalda de Lara. En la mayoría de los casos esto resuelve los ángulos incómodos en los saltos y otros momentos críticos.[/i]

Así que, en conclusión, la única forma de jugar en este punto es con controles de tanque y los gráficos viejos.

It is cruel, technologically limited, mostly ugly, extremely difficult and it plays unlike any other game on the market. But mostly, what makes it great is its cruelty. The developpers assumed players of Tomb Raider 3 had played a Tomb Raider game before, and decided to waste no time torturing them. If you press one wrong button, if you don't take time to plan each jump, if you try to rush it and cut corners, you will die. Tomb Raider 3 isn't a flowing parcour simulator. It is an endurance test of methiculous, high stress platforming where each button press has to be carefully weighed.

Now, since I have you trapped, I'll mention that, as of writing this paragraph, the Tomb Raider Remastered Trilogy still isn't out. It's coming out in like three days. And, let me make something clear. I have never pre-ordered a game more than a day or two before it launched. And every time I regretted it. I pre-ordered Colonial Marines a day before its launched and I still have PTSD from that.

Yet, when I saw the first trailer for this remaster. I had to put money down right away. I have been waiting for these games to get proper ports for so long. I'm looking at the store page over and over, just looking at the seconds slowly tick down until the game finally releases. I honestly don't remember the last time I was so excited to play a game. I'm trying to come up with a game that had me more excited. And the only game I can think of would've been Metal Gear Solid 5, for which I spent half a year with Midge Ures' cover of The Man Who Sold the World as my morning alarm...

And, with that, the Remastered Trilogy is finally done downloading.
Now the first thing I did when opening the game, after meticulously reading 40 pages of legal documents, was to play The Lost Artifact. The Lost Artifact was essentially old school 90s DLC for Tomb Raider 3. It's a collection of two or three levels that complete or expand or have nothing to do with Tomb Raider 3's main plot.

Now, it should be said that, despite being someone who likes games for their narrative, my interest with Tomb Raider is purely gameplay related. I have no idea what is happening in any of these old games and I don't care.

One thing I needed to get to grips with right away was the new camera. It used to be, in the PS1 version, that using the right analog stick would stick you in the back of Lara's head. And pressing all the way down would make you instantly look all the way up. It sounds dumb, but it really worked and it connected the camera and the character in a way that just felt natural.
The new camera is more modern. It simply pivots around the character, like normal. It seems like it would be a blessing. But these games were never constructed around having a free camera. And, paired with tank controls, it just doesn't feel quite as right. I essentially never used it.

The only times I did, it would get stuck on the environment and bug the hell out anyway. I really wish that they give us the option of using the old right stick camera, eventually. Thankfully, there is still a button to look around. So the old camera is mostly here. It's just not as well implemented as the one in the PS1 versions of Tomb Raider 3, 4 and 5.
Really, all I miss is being able to make Lara go down with the sickness...
Now, I started with The Lost Artifact, and you might wonder why. Why start with the tail end of the trilogy? Well, it's simple. On PC, every release, for the original trilogy, had a few extra levels. These levels weren't part of the main game, though. They were distributed for free as a sort of demo. Or, at least, it was the case for the first two games.

But, with Tomb Raider 3, Eidos got greedy and they decided to release that extension, not as a demo, but as a cheaper standalone game. Except, nowadays, that expansion pack costs about as much on ebay as the full game. Which isn't much, actually. These games are surprisingly cheap. But, what it means is that I never got to try these levels.

It should be mentionned that my love for old school Tomb Raider games isn't born out of nostalgia. The oldest memory I have of these games was seeing other people play them, rather than playing them myself. I remember seeing someone playing one of the games, when I was about 10 years old. He kept dying on the same part over and over. I tought the game looked pretty hard... Only, later, I discovered the part he was dying to over and over to was the very first slope of the very first level of Tomb Raider 3.

But, it wasn't until around 2010 that I personally dipped my toe into that franchise, by buying the first game and installing it on my PSP. I never finished the first game. I might finish it now. But I simply find it a lot less interesting, varied and creative then the following two games. I mean, let me put it this way. Tomb Raider 2 has a venitian opera house and a shipwreck at the bottom of the ocean. Tomb Raider 3 has the London Underground and area 51. Tomb Raider 1 has tombs... You raid the tombs... It's a game about raiding tombs. Yeah, it is very basic.

But, anyway, let me give you some tips to get you going if you wan't any chance to beat these games. You can light a flare, at any time, by holding select and pressing R1. If you get stuck, which will happen, don't be ashamed to look up a playtrough. These games were essentially desinged on a whim and their level and puzzle desing isn't always the most orthodox.

Take this switch in Shakespeare Cliff, the third level of The Last Artifact, I would never have assumed that there'd be a crutial switch there, but here it is. Its placement is so random, so cruel. You don't feel like an idiot for not figuring it out; You feel like an idiot for not checking a guide sooner. This cruel ""where the hell do I go and what do I do"" attitude of the old Tomb Raider games is kind of what makes these games special.

Especially before the real internet, this difficulty was at the core of the experience. The fact that you'd get stuck and have to ask a friend who's played the game for help, or something. It's what made the Tomb Raider games feel like genuine adventures. These games used to take months to beat because of sheer complexity. But now, with a guide, you can easily beat one of these suckers in less than a week.

Now, the tank controls might seem like a hindrance at first, but the level desing in these games demands so much precision and care that, by the end of the first few levels, you'll be thanking some made up deity for giving you these tank controls. That being said, I'm sure playing without them would do just fine. I am not going to play without them, though. Not even for the simple thoroughness of making a review. For me, Tomb Raider either has tank controls, or its not Tomb Raider.

While I'm talking specifically about this remaster, there are a few oddities that I noticed. Like the fact that the quicksand, deep mud or whatever it is no longer wobbles. Making it seem essentially no different than standard terrain. Then there's also the issue that piranhas and fish seem to have no models.

Pros
- Beautifully redone model, textures and lighting effects. 
- Photo Mode added for those who might enjoy it. 
- Plenty of Achievements (excluding Switch version). 
- Modern controls are a nice novelty addition. 
- Includes the first 3 games and their expansion packs. 
- Very reasonable price considering the content. 

Cons
- The new lighting can often be too dark to see things properly. 
- Modern controls could use a bit of tweaking, especially during combat and with camera angles. 
- Photo Mode could have used a few more options for positioning Lara. 
- Ability to change Lara's outfit in photo mode, but not in-game, feels very disappointing. 
- One or two minor graphical glitches at times. 

Overall it's a very good remaster, exactly what I would hope for. The lighting issues I'm currently resolving by switching the graphics to classic mode when needed, this usually drastically lights up the dark areas. I've not encountered anything terrible bugs, but I did notice that there is no way to reset your number of saves when overwriting an old save file with a new one, which is mildly annoying, especially since there is an achievement tied to amount of saves you make - Hoping this will be fixed soon. 

I'm very happy with the collection, as I never assumed the visuals would get such an upgrade, but it has and I really appreciate it. Recommended for fans of the originals, or people who want to get an idea of what they were like.

They have also added some much needed QoL updates to some of the movements in 1 and 3 and they only serve to improve the game and not take away from it. I haven't used modern controls because I've always preferred tank controls so I can't speak on that. I'm also super happy that they've made the save system better because it makes the games (3 especially) much less tedious and repetitive and punishing. What's also awesome is that once you've beaten each game, you can do a new game+ mode which honours the classic save system if you want a challenge which is so awesome. One thing I will say that really bugs me is that you can't replay certain levels once you've beaten them. I would love to play the Temple of Xian from 2 again because I really enjoy that level and the visuals in the remaster are incredible but in order for me to do that I would need to play through the whole game again (as it is at the end of the game) just to play it.

The new quality of life features makes this game accessible for a broader audience. The ability to save anywhere cuts down on redoing frustrating segments. There's also a plethora of achievements to unlock if you're into that sort of thing.

There are a few issues though. Controlling Lara is still a chore at times, and timing her jumps can be tricky. I've died more to falls than anything else in these games. The new ""Modern"" controls actually feel worse to me, and I keep accidentally jumping backwards when I use the analog stick. 

Another issue I had was with the lighting. Yes it's more realistic, but that makes some areas much darker and harder to navigate. I had to switch to the old graphics a few times just to make sure I wasn't missing anything because on more than one occasion I bypassed a key item as they were hard to see. Not only due to the lighting, but because the sprites themselves are smaller. If you find a key in the game try switching from the new graphics to the old. It's like night and day.

TL;DR
I would suggest waiting for at least one patch, but what's here is very promising already.

So far I've played TR1, its expansion and part of TR2. There are a handful of visual glitches like incorrect textures or some missing statue but they're pretty rare (I recall three in the first game, none in the expansion and one in 2 so far).

The system requirements are luckily very low, and the game is able to run at any frame rate without breaking game logic (capped by V-Sync). However, it lacks any kind of in-game setting and it instead defaults to desktop resolution and refresh rate, forced V-Sync in borderless windowed mode (can switch to normal windowed with alt+enter, which scales to any size and aspect ratio).
The classic mode is also internally capped at 30fps and does not offer bilinear filtering for textures (for those who prefer the classic PC visuals).

Sometimes the classic graphics are brighter than the remastered ones (mainly TR1), sometimes darker (TR2 so far), and things like the rusty keys in the cistern level are tiny and blend in with the floor texture with modern graphics, so you might wanna switch to the classic mode from time to time.
That being said, the remastered graphics are very pretty and much more atmospheric overall IMO.

Tank controls work as you'd expect if you're used to the classics, but the modern controls could really use some tweaks (mainly its camera and lack of consistent/intuitive backstep).
Lara's home is the tutorial level, but sadly it doesn't really acommodate to modern controls. Some tutorials still apply for the most part while others end up being slightly confusing.
They seem promising though, they just need a revision IMO.

Bear in mind that despite the addition of modern controls, these games have some unique rules and mechanics that you will need to learn regardless. Lara cannot perform a running jump before she takes a few steps for example (and you should hold the jump button, not tap it).

If you'd like to use different outfits in-game, I made the following mod:

Pros & Cons:

+ It's great to have all 3 titles fully remastered in one collection. With the DLC campaigns. For the price, it's an absolute bargain.
+ Being able to switch instantly between old and new graphics is great and, unlike in other games I've played with this option, I'm finding myself using it a lot.
+ They've faithfully retained the little things that make the originals so nostalgic, from the music, to the menus, to Lara's look, and the survival horror-like atmosphere. They haven't tried to impose their own vision on something they didn't create (this drives me mad in game remasters/remakes and tv/film adaptations); they've handled it with respect.
+ There are quite a few little optional upgrades that you can toggle on and off in the settings, like subtitles, context sensitive action prompts, enemy health bars, etc.

| The visual upgrade isn't going to blow you away, largely because it's a faithful remaster in terms of gameplay, which means any visual overhaul is limited by the geometry used almost 30 years ago. That said, the graphics do look better in-game than in screenshots, and above all it's great to be able to play these games on HD monitors without it making your eyes bleed.

- The modern controls are a missed opportunity. Not all moves are available using modern controls, while other moves like backwards jumping and side jumping require you to have weapons out, but this is never explained anywhere in-game, and it's counter-intuitive. I wish they'd come up with a middle ground option of old school jump abilities mixed with modern camera and character movement. I quickly defaulted back to tank controls and haven't looked back since.
- The cinematic cut scenes haven't been properly remastered, only the in-engine ones :(

If you played any of these games all those years ago and have some nostalgia for them, this is definitely worth a purchase. Newcomers without any emotional attachment to them, however, will find the visuals dated (even with the remaster) and the gameplay probably quite frustrating because of a mix of precision-based platforming and tricky old-school controls.

So any ""remastered"" feature that comes along is just an extra for me, i don't really care if the modern controls are broken as the bad reviews say so.

But in my few hours of playtesting i have noticed a few things which is worth mentioning for hardcore classic players:

-There is no settings to adjust brightness at all, classic mode feels a bit too bright in well lit areas, and a few dark areas you no longer need to use a flare to see anything.

-There is no settings to adjust the framerate, remastered mode has very smooth framerate, but switching to classic mode brings the framerate down to very choppy, which never existed in the originals PS1 or PC versions.

-The remaster mode has nice sound reverbs added which is very cool, but as soon as you toggle to classic mode, all that glamorous reverb goes away because ""classic nostalgia does not deserve any enhancements"", i wish i could manually toggle the reverb i don't like this being exclusive for the remaster mode only.

-Classic mode water distortion effect no longer exists, which was a huge impression at the time, remaster mode does not have it either.

-The inventory menu background texture is just black in all 3 remasters and TR1 and 3 classic, only TR2 classic mode the texture is correct which is that elegant red carpet waving effect.

This remaster is really well done and is a really good way to bring new players to the classics.
But me as a veteran hardcore gamer with 2 decades of experience with the old TR games i'm not really impressed by the HD graphics, my expectations was to see a well polished port to substitute the old executables, but those points i mentioned above are kinda triggering me so i can't fully recommend this remaster until they fix those.

If you really don't care about classic mode, then i do recommend, this remaster is good enough and has no major flaws.
But if you are like me and expect the remaster to 100% replace the old PS1 and PC versions, then not really (unless they fix those issues i mentioned above).

Now a small surprise for those of you who have read to the end, i have also noticed that in TR3 you can actually crouch roll from a sprint, which is a TR4 move... and also roll off a ledge when facing forward while crouching, which is a TR5 move... maybe this is just an easter egg, or perhaps an accidental proof that they are really planning in remastering TR4 and TR5 as well.",1708314216,1708315360,True,23,0,0.655306994915008545,0,True,False,False

There are subtle level design changes, mostly regarding lighting and the sky, which actually make a lot more sense, especially with a longer view distance.

The graphics are nice enough, but sometimes the odd geometry of the maps stands out. System Shock Remake had the same jarring effect. It's difficult to strike a balance between remastering the graphics without re-imagining too much. It would have been nice to see a greater effort into remaking the pre-rendered cut-scenes between levels, rather than simply upscale them, maybe this isn't possible?

The controls on the other hand are abysmal, as they were at the time. The modern controls are worse again thanks to the automatic camera which will flip the controls back to tank so long as it's operating.

Great job.

There is some room for improvement, mainly the combat in modern controls (target locking is terrible) and some visual details and animations here and there (head-bobbing in the in-game cutscenes, a couple of misplaced textures). But overall this is a wonderful remaster.

To address the modern controls - I think most people who are disappointed with them had their expectations a bit too high. These games are almost 3 decades old, they can never be turned into a modern shooter-platformer like the Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider games. They are simply built with different movement in mind and they are designed to be played patiently and carefully.

Just an awesome game. But i would recommend (at least for now) using tank controls instead of the modern controls.
I can't say more like that. So I am adding some tips for new raiders :>


[h2] Quick Controll Guide (PC) [/h2]

F1: Switch from old to remaster graphics and vice versa
F3: Fotomode
Arrow-Keys (between ctrl (right) and numpad): movement
Ctrl: Action, Press Buttons, Pull Levers and Grab (if in air)
alt (left): jump
space: equip weapon
Numbers: Weapons, Medkits

I would recommend rebinding flares and roll button to:
D: Flare
S: roll

at least this works for me :)


[h2]Getting Started Guide[/h2]

1. Save often and use more than one save slot. Trust me. 

----
[h3] 2. Movement[/h3]
2.1  Tomb Raider is Grid based, this means Lara jumps and movements are tired to the grid
Therefore you have:

Small Jumps:
2.2 Single Jumps (inkl.Backflip, Sideflip) 
2.3 Roll 
2.4  Hop back (Arrow down)

Middle Jumps:
2.5 Shift+Arrow up and Jump button (walks and jumps)

Long Jumps:
2.6 After Hop back, run and press jump (she walks and jumps; this is the longest jump ~ 4 gridblocks)

----

3. when in doubt and jump, GRAB (using ctrl or action button) 
4. sometimes it helps to switch to the old graphic (F1) if you are missing an item or something. In the remasters graphic they can be quite small and without outlines (happened to me in TR 1 cistern)
5. Take your time. And if you struggle learn the movements and train the jumps in Laras Home first.

Have fun, raiding tombs and adventuring with OG Lara <3",1708300890,1708301157,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Just finished Tomb Raider I on this remaster and played through Lara's Home on TR2, so yes I still haven't played TR2 and TR3 on this remaster.

But as a player of the original games back in the day, I can tell what this is. It's very faithful to the originals, making it a preservation dream, since now it now features crisp textures, improved lighting and resolutions and framerates as far as you can imagine.

True to the originals, this is about the level design and traversing through the levels with a mix of jumping/navigation skills and spacial awareness, occasionally with some enemies along the way.

I played with the original tank controls from the original 90's releases. Nowadays, they feel completely backwards, but the truth is all the games were originally designed with that in mind - you cannot really enjoy these without taking into account the time period.

That said, of course it's sad the modern controls are giving many people grief from what I can see online, but I really don't see a way they could have made it better. These games originally are like a 3D version of the original Prince of Persia in DOS - the controls are tightly knit into the ""grid"" design of the game and if you just put the modern fine-tuned and very flexible 3D controls into it, all the level design just feels boring. 

Also, this is a time where the production values are nowhere near what we see nowadays. The game is so quiet and the cutscenes so non-detailed (compared to what we see usually today) it's so interesting how much stuff a player made in their own mind to fill all that whilst playing.

With all these honest ""cons"" for it, I cannot but feel reunited with the feeling of true exploration and being immersed in these locales, just as I did originally. Usually it's very quiet and you are focused on the minute actions you need to do the platforming and being quick on the reactions when enemies pop-up. And if, like originally, you let your mind fill the ""make belief"" on locations you are on - the ancient Greece one tickled my fancy - it's no wonder you can understand the allure of the original games.

It can also be an exercise in delving through the history of gaming, and I wholeheartedly encourage people to find and watch the many documentaries about the original franchise on YT and the likes, and then play the actual thing presented here with modern accouterments. Just going from TR1 to TR2 and then TR3, the jumps in features are obvious and very interesting in what games can make available to players.

So, TLDR: 
--------------
if you are far removed from this era, I fear it's going to be hard to get into the mindspace of the level design for these games, no matter how nice the graphics and performance are improved - since they are very tied to the original tank controls. If you are an existing fan or if you've lived through the era and never played the originals, this is the perfect release for an historical expedition. BTW as an experienced player (this is like my 4th TR2 playthrough, I think) this is now  my favourite podcast game

PS: I hope that people buying this signals and enables a new modern entry in the series. The ""newer"" Tomb Raider trilogy (started in 2013) is impressive and imho totally deserves continuation. And amidst the Embracer group woes, I truly fear the franchise is in series risk of being lost, never for the likes of an intrepid adventurer such as Lara to unearth it ever again :(",1708296138,1708297467,True,11,0,0.59960252046585083,0,True,False,False

Tomb Raider I-III Remastered Starring Lara Croft offers the first three games in the remastered and enhanced form, with roughly 50 or so levels and 40-60 hours of playtime, depending on how familiar you are with the original releases. If you're an avid achievement hunter, expect playtime above 100 hours to 100% everything.

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 20/20[/b]

Gameplay-wise, each game in this pack offers something fresh and different. At the time of release, Tomb Raider (1996) mixed puzzle-solving with platforming and combat set in ancient tombs and ruins. Tomb Raider 2 (1997) expanded on the the first game, introducing more intricate puzzles, larger environments, and new weapons and enemies, making for a more complete adventure. Tomb Raider 3: Aventures of Lara Croft (1998) introduced more diverse environments compared to the two previous games, including new gameplay mechanics such as vehicles, while improving the puzzles and offering an even greater variety of enemies to deal with.

While everything above is excellent, it's worth mentioning that these games aren't your post-2013 reboot Tomb Raider or Uncharted games with the main focus on the narrative. While there is a story to follow, these games lean more toward freedom of problem-solving and thinking - rather than running through scripted and pre-defined patterns in each section. Each corner and place on the map hides and holds something, and each new section you discover offers even more fun (as you get used to and learn the gameplay mechanics more and more, the game becomes more fun) than the previous one, and enemy encounters complement the rest nicely. As I mentioned above, these compare in no way to the newer installments, and if it's your first time playing these games, get ready to learn to play video games just the way kids learn to make their first steps.

As someone who's played and enjoyed these games a long time ago, I'll tell you this: these games are DIFFICULT but REWARDING, and when I say difficult, I mean extremely hard, especially for newcomers. It's important to understand that these games are the classic platforming Dark Souls-type games with a steep learning curve. There's zero hand-holding involved, no modern survival instinct gameplay mechanics, but a ton of hints and guidelines spread throughout the levels. Take the first several hours to understand how the game works, observe and absorb everything, and allow yourself the time to think. Otherwise, whatever you do will lead to frustration. Just a heads up that you'll die a lot, reload your saves more often than ever before, and find yourself going through the same section of a level dozens of times, and that's normal.

[h1][b]Presentation[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 15/20[/b]

Considering that this pack includes three very similar yet quite different games, it's hard to comment, let alone write about everything from the presentation standpoint - but I'll do my best to emphasize what caught my attention the most. The remastering effort is the work of Aspyr Media, a studio known for its remastering and re-releasing endeavors of classic games for modern platforms. I'm starting to believe that whatever Aspyr touches turns into gold, this pack of games included. It's hard to argue what could've been better, as the switch between the classic release and the remastering effort can be done with a single press of a button, letting you see how the remasters improve upon the original releases in so many ways but there are a few things I want to mention. Some historical inaccuracies aside - I'm in love with how they brought the modern vision of these classics.

The first issue I have with the graphical side is that certain items are too hard to spot due to lightning, and considering how the lightning works in the classic versions, it's helpful to switch between the two. Certain items, such as keys, are too small, making it hard to see even if they're next to you as they blend in with new textures, while they're 5x the size in the classic version. Also, various environmental textures look out of place (unaligned) or super low-resolution assets spread across the game, but considering that the levels are blocks stacked up, it's understandable. The improvements to the audio side of things are excellent as well. Certain score pieces were re-touched (remastered, if you will) and sound so much better. Some sound cues sound different (placebo effect?), but I'm sure some are new to my ears.

[b]Rating: 14/20[/b]

In the Tomb Raider, Lara Croft sets on her quest to recover the Scion, a powerful artifact hidden within the lost city of Atlantis. The game introduces players to Lara's world of exploration and discovery, with complex puzzles, challenging platforming sections, and intense combat encounters. The first game sets a steady pace while gradually ramping up the difficulty as players get the hang of things and progress through various tombs and environments. While the first game is a classic and a stepping stone of the Tomb Raider franchise, its story lacks the details of the latter installments, making it a less-than-ideal story-based game today. It's a platforming game at its core and does a great job of being one.

In Tomb Raider 2, Lara sets out to retrieve the Dagger of Xian, a legendary artifact rumored to possess great power, while facing off against the ruthless mafia boss, Marco Bartoli. Building upon its predecessor, Tomb Raider 2 offers larger environments, more complex puzzles, and an expanded array of weapons and enemies. The underwater sections and vehicle segments add to the variety of gameplay. The game keeps a fast pace, with intense action sequences interconnected with moments of exploration and puzzle-solving. The narrative starts to shape into a proper story, a huge bonus and improvement compared to the first entry for anyone who likes proper storytelling being a part of their games.

Tomb Raider 3 takes Lara on a globe-trotting adventure to recover four mysterious artifacts known as the Infada Stones while uncovering a conspiracy involving a secret organization known as the RX Tech. With more levels, environments, and gameplay mechanics, the third game offers the most expansive experience. The third game offers more varied locales, including jungles, deserts, and urban environments, along with the introduction of vehicles for traversal. The game maintains a dynamic pace, with each level offering new challenges and surprises to keep the attention from start to finish. This installment offers the most detailed and sophisticated story.

I'll briefly say that the game doesn't offer any PC-specific options to change the graphics settings or in-game resolution, but considering how low the PC system requirements are, this shouldn't be a concern for anyone. The game defaults to the monitor's highest refresh rate and resolution. However, it'd be nice to include at least the resolution and vertical sync options. When switching between the classic versions and the remasters, it's evident that the classics are locked to 30 fps, while the remasters remain unlocked. Other than a few quirks performance-wise that can be cleaned up within the respective graphics card control panels (players shouldn't need to do this on their own) - I haven't experienced any other issues. There are also a few issues with the camera positioning and player input not matching, but nothing game-breaking.

[b]Rating: 81/100[/b]

Tomb Raider I-III Remastered is more than a decent (the only and proper way) remastering effort for the classic games. So many games could use a similar approach, as releasing such games as new entries today wouldn't work. I appreciate the attention and effort put into these releases and wish the rest of the entries, especially 4-6, would get the same releases.",1708292243,1708292243,True,16,1,0.581487298011779785,0,True,False,False

As someone who is personally familiar with how difficult it is to get the original games to run properly, I am very happy to see these games finally preserved for the next generation. To me the gameplay for these games is timeless and luckily Aspyr didn't change anything in that department. What you get as a bonus is smooth 60 fps, improved beautiful graphics, an option for modern controls and a photo mode fully equipped with some poses and outfit options.

Still, I feel a need to mention that there is a lot of room for further improvements - and I do hope Aspyr gives us at least some of these things with future updates. What kind of things? Well... here is a short list:
1. There are a few minor bugs I encounted here and there. The biggest one of them was the wrong texture on a single square in St. Francis Folly right where you encounter the first crocodile and swim up in the opening for the third secret. This won't break your progress, but it is visually extremely jarring.
2. When it comes to modern controls, it's a shame that you lose the ability to jump backwards and do backflips unless you have your weapons ready. Without a way to jump backwards and do backflips, the modern controls are just objectively inferior, which is a shame. There should be an easy way to update the controls so that Lara moves without her weapons the same way as when she has her weapons ready. That's all Aspyr needs to do to fix the modern controls, so I hope we see this change with the next patch.
3. I also wish that Aspyr would update the FMV sequences as they have been only slightly upscaled and it's a missed opportunity not to remaster them properly.
4. I also miss Lara's credit pictures when you finish the game. At the very least Aspyr could show us a slideshow of the screenshots we made when the credits start rolling, but ultimitely, Lara's credit pictures should be remastered as well.

Regardless, I recommend this remaster easily to both old and new players!",1708291643,1708291643,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will admit, conclusions were jumped to initially. This is because the controls mechanics are displayed but not defined. Still, overtime, I realized that the classic signature jump dodging is, in fact, worked into the modern controls very well. There's a learning curve depending on the gamer's generation and the chosen control scheme. As a mature gamer, I opted to learn the modern controls and ""fell in love all over again.' Not only are the AI updated textures phenominal. Lara Croft's and enemy 3D models are charming in all their cartoony glory. Rendered light bathes Lara and every inch of the world. I didn't want Aspyr to think visuals were enough to satisfy. That was a prejudgement. My revelation for TR 1-3 remastered is that it is literally everything old school fans dreamed for the franchise. Fluid controls, maddening puzzles that consistently leave the player feeling conquered, beautiful graphics and serene adventures that grant the most rewarding feeling upon triumph are what makes TR 1-3 perfect. My one valid complaint would be how super buggy the camera gets in cramped tomb spaces. I imagine this wont be as bad in 2-3 with the more numerous open spaces. It is TOMB RAIDER.

This isn't really a series that's compatible with modern controls. All of the original titles were built around classic tank controls, and that's really the only control method that works, simply because there are so many precise jumps and walking positions where you need to be in just the exact spot to line up your jump-and-grab. Imagine the entire game on a grid and you're jumping from one block to another. Too short or too long of a jump will probably cause your death, and that was intentionally built into these games.

But I'm okay with that, since that's how I always played.

Only 1 stage in and it's everything I was hoping for, I will edit the review & update if my opinion is to change. As a fan of the original trilogy this is a dream come true. Beautiful graphics, old school controls, from what I can tell original soundtrack.

Minor beefs:-

1. Modern control setting is off by default but from what I can tell you can't side or back jump in the classic Lara style with it turned on. So I switched back to Tank controls. Was really looking forward to a new control setup that made it easier but if it affects how the jump animations appear then it's not worth it.

2. As expected they didn't really remaster the FMV cinematics. Yes they are slightly better, since the originals when played on a modern PC LCD look weird as they were designed for CRT I think. So now they look proper on LCD but aren't a bump up in graphics. So you go from beautiful in game graphics to the old school FMVs which are poorer graphics & it sorta ruins immersion.

3. I keep accidentally hitting Start to pause but now that causes me to switch to old school graphics. Now I know that was an advertised feature & I understand why this may be cool for some but I'm here to play remastered graphics all the way through. Instead I get that beer goggles effect in a bar with a charming lady becoming a monster when I sober up every time I accidentally out of reflex try to pause. Maybe provide a way to turn that feature off or do what PS4 would do for PS2 games and make the touch pad on PS controllers into the new Start / Pause button.

4. Where or how do I use the screenshot edit feature that was advertised? I tried hitting other buttons on the PS4 controller but haven't discovered it yet. I want this feature as I'm a screenshot tourist when I game & love the idea of editing her clothes / facial expressions for every screenshot. Or did I imagine I read this was a feature somewhere?

Very highly recommended if you are into old school games, and you want to experience an old game with improved graphical presentation. But if you're going into this expecting this remaster being anywhere close to a modern game, you're not going to have a good time as it stays very true to it's old school roots.

Three pieces of criticism:
- The modern control scheme is quite poorly implemented unfortunately. Hopefully this can be addressed with a future patch, but as it stands they are so iffy that they don't offer much convenience over the tank controls. The combat and time limited challenges in the game are also balanced around the tank controls, and being able to turn instantly with modern controls makes these parts trivial and ruins the tension of the game. I would highly recommend playing with the original tank controls.

- It's awesome to be able to switch to the original graphics with a single button press, but unfortunately that mode introduces not only a 30 FPS limit, but also frame pacing issues. While that is perhaps closer to the original than a well paced 60FPS, I don't think the original game's feel and atmosphere depend on the poor framerate at all. It just makes it uncomfortable to look at and needlessly so. The old graphics mode is still nice to have, but you probably want to switch back and forth while stationary, not during movement.

- The 3D effect on the ladders seems highly misplaced. It doesn't make the graphics feel better, and it also doesn't help staying true to the original. I see no reason to keep this effect.

The modern enhancements breathe a unique personality to the worlds; examples being the windowed ceilings, a sky (Tomb Raider I), and alternate lighting directions compared to their originals.

The expansions also being an appreciated inclusion. Having never played them before, now being given the chance enjoy them all-in-one package.

   I personally really appreciate the faithfulness to the originals itself: the easy option to alternate between the two variations, and the faithfulness to the ‘original content’.

Use the classic/tank controls (I haven't bothered trying the modern controls). Tomb Raider requires precise platforming skills; the controls can be a little frustrating for new players but it pays off to learn and master them.

Be prepared to explore, solve puzzles and shoot enemies. Most of the time the games won't tell you what you need to do to progress. You will have to try, fail and try again. Some parts can be difficult but it feels very rewarding when you conquer a level or when you discover every secret and pickup in a tomb.

Ignore the preachy opening disclaimer, Crystal Dynamics has little to do with this game. In fact, buy this remaster to support this classic take on Tomb Raider instead of the generic modern CD one.

This is a warts and all remaster. The same exact games with the same exact flaws. It does the MCC thing where you can switch between classic and updated graphics with a press of a button. The updated graphics look more like a PS2 game. All of this will either sound great or awful to you. I am the former. If you want a more modern experience, play the CD Uncharted Raider games.

Just a heads up, there is one instance of censorship in this collection (in TR III a pin-up of a topless woman has been edited to wear a bikini). I will never condone censorship, but I am willing to overlook this one thing. If you are not, that's understandable.

Yeah I agree with the comments. Maybe nit picking a fair bit, I quite like it now. Apart from the water.
--

Things I Like:

Lara's model. She really is stunning, well done! 
Being able to play Tr1 with original graphics on a PC that isn't DOS! Love that and its my favourite feature. 
They kept it faithful to the originals.
60fps.
Lighting, is very nice .
The audio is good, but expect clicking and popping when the camera moves from underwater to above or sudden cut scene changes, this is a rookie issue! Code in something to emulate 'zero crossings' (fade).
They kept tank controls, big thumbs up here.
Load and splash screens are lovely.


Overall a good job.

Things I don't like (sorry): 

No volumetric clouds, also they just sit there and do nothing, they look nice enough I guess...
No ambient occlusion. (come on... it's 2024)
Graphical bugs, TR2 from outside looking into laras home there are big blue reflection map bug creating issues. (from the front of the house near the fish fountain look in the window, very ugly)
No anti aliasing.
No water reflections, OpenLare water is miles nicer, the water is also generic across all 3 games, where as in TR3 the water was much greener in the original. The water is quite rubbish sorry.
TR2 Inventory is missing the wavy red background. Big thumbs down here, whats that all about?
New asset 'pop in' this is quite bad in TR3.
Overall it lacks the charm of the original graphics but I do like how the original graphics do not use texture filtering.
Movable blocks are now very obvious and stand out too much same with items that are usually hard to spot they now stand out too easily. 

Small things I know, but for me it just feels rushed. 

7.5/10. I fully recommend, but you wont be blown away like we were back in the 90's. The audio click/pop issue it very disappointing in 2024. But as an audio engineer perhaps I notice it more than most people.",1707907712,1708261595,True,112,2,0.756985068321228027,7,True,False,False

I had a lot of hype for this release and I played the first one less than a month ago, it's a real pain having to look for mods for the controls and for a decent resolution but honestly it's definitely better than the first one from the remaster... too bad we live in the age where the only thing that matters is graphics...

I didn't ask for a refound just because I have every single Tomb Raider game in my collection and it was my Valentine's gift, but honestly with a little patience and a lot of online research the three original chapters can be modded better than these remasters (graphics aside)...

I recommend spending a maximum of €5/$ on this product, no more...

If you're like me, I think you'll like this remaster. It brings many light-touch improvements, while still letting you experience the originals in all their jagged, pixelly beauty.

A key recommendation: the F1 key will switch between old-style graphics and new-style, instantaneously. You can switch multiple times per room and see the differences. This is a bold choice by the developers, and one I respect a lot - anything that's lost in translation becomes way more obvious if you adopt this habit. It also means if all you want is a way to play the classic tomb raiders at a smooth frame rate and screen resolution, you've got them all in one package here; in old-style graphics mode, I don't think I would be able to tell there's any difference from the original game.

So far I've only played through the TR2 mansion and the Venice/Bartolli's Hideout/Opera House levels. The graphical overhauls are very carefully-done. The textures are heavily inspired by the originals; they have tried to work out what they were aiming for and realise it more fully. Ladders, doors, and panels have a 3D look to them while behaving exactly the same. Rents in the wallpaper are lovingly recreated. If I have a complaint it's that they have made the lighting more forgiving, to the extent that many things that were INTENDED to be difficult to see (certain gold dragons for instance) are now trivial. Sometimes instead of pulling a flair I've just switched to new-style graphics. It's hard to be too bitter about this though when the original game is frustratingly dingy (perhaps to avoid over-taxing the engine).

I've stuck to tank controls and they work exactly as my muscle-memory expects them to, so I can't comment on the new-style controls.

Overall, I think this might be my preferred way to experience the classic Tomb Raiders from here on out. I don't exaggerate when I say I can see myself playing this remaster for decades to come.

Chuck the stupid bow and pickaxes away and don her signature double guns and dry wit as you revisit the happier part of your childhood blasted in hd, with extremely faithful and respectful 3d additions : where the limits of the tech of the times had 2d flat decals and sprites, magnificent 3d models for greenery, decor and bas-reliefs have now made the three games into exactly what I pictured them to be when I played the originals.
And it's not just about new assets and visuals : this is the best lara model/incarnation ever made so my heartfelt thanks to the artists who brought her to life again.
If that isn't milking your nostalgia dry, you can flip to the original visuals at the press of a button.
Wonderful additions include the semi-lost to time DLCs for all three games, which usually came with PC magazines and were not officially available to the general public without some research, photo mode, a last attempt at grabbing ledges in the modern scheme if you hold the now separated movement button, all special moves from TR5 - namely the crouching roll and the crouch flip into openings - and the infamous modern scheme which I'm personally having no big issue with.
The modern scheme allows you to move as in any latest 3rd person game instead of the dreaded, difficult tank controls, but comes with a few caveats, such as the fact that the game relies on specific distances for long jumps, and shooting while using side jumps and backflips to put distance between you and enemies becomes sometimes an unelegant dance with the camera fixing into a nearby wall whenever Lara's movement becomes inconsistent between the schemes.
Furthermore the camera tends to get royally screwed up whenever she walks into tight spaces, though pressing the ""look"" button resets it to a viable position.
That being said, the games are as unforgiving as they always were regardless of the control scheme you choose. When new gamer generations were praising the ""difficulty"" of soulslikes after decades of handholding, Tomb Raider was already there to punish you for any mistake and rub it in, with no grinding or self imposed challenges to boot.
Pros :
- Perfect and stylish remaster of three timeless classic that is extremely respectful of the original material, which also adds significant additions such as skylights, decorations, light fixtures and 3d details
- All features, including the menus, Lara's home versions, and upscaled original CG movies
- The lost levels, which were self contained adventures that used to be published with magazines, are all included and can be selected from the new game menu without any extra steps
- quality of life additions such as automatic underwater weapon selection when lara is submerged and a toggleable exclamation mark icon whenever she can interact with the environment 
- Modern scheme to move Lara as you please

Cons :
- the modern schemes needs to be customized and refined : LAra can easily run all over the place and fall, the camera gets bungled up in tight spaces, shooting controls need a rework though I easily became accustomed to the jankiness quickly
- the vibes can get anguishing fast : the old series didn't give a crap about keeping you cheery with funky music. In some levels, all you will hear is demonic echo and heartbeats and that can get depressing if you played already a lot
- too many achievements, most of which are dull and uninspired, are there to take up your time in exchange for bragging rights over 100% the game. Personally, finishing the games with all secrets found and a few that point out a few cool tricks everyone may not be aware of would have been all that was needed. Having an objective for using the corner bug is not something I'd waste my time for.

In short, get this if you loved the tomb raider the world came to love, dislike protagonists crying for daddy at every save spot, and you like punishing gameplay and mind bogging levels leaving you head scratching for days and then finally giving up and checking the holy Stella walthrough (thank you forever Stella you're the best).",1708249496,1708249496,True,1,0,0.511834323406219482,0,True,False,False

Promotional screenshots also did not give any clear impression of anything out of the ordinary. However, when I actually saw it in action, I was simply astonished from how much the game was improved visually, as well as the amount of work and detail that has been put into this remaster.

[h3] The visuals [/h3]
Almost every texture in game has not just been upscaled but redone from scratch, without moving away from the original sources at the same time. And it's not just that. One would expect clamps of blocks (e.g. walls, rocks, terrain, constructions, etc.) look even more weird and clunky now that we've got a higher resolution. Amazingly enough, the new textures look almost seamless and somehow make the overall scenery look much more unified, realistic and, believe it or not, less blocky. All level backgrounds have been replaced with more colorful and high resolution versions, including sky textures that now look just awesome. The overall effect is being magnified even further by carefully added localized special effects (e.g. sunlit dust, insects flying over flowers, etc.) and volumetric fog placed throughout the levels. All creatures and lootables were redone in 3D with increased polygon count without losing the original style. In addition, almost every location that had any type of vegetation (e.g. TR3 India or South Pacific) was enhanced with animated leaves, bushes and grass. And as an icing on the cake, every level in the game now has an appropriate color filter that intensifies the mood. So instead of running through the Lego Land now it actually feels like a forest or a town or a ruin. 

[h3] Other improvements [/h3]
I haven't dived into the technical specs of the remastered version, still all points to a highly upgraded or even rewritten from scratch game engine that was designed to support all original resources and scripts. With that, besides the improved visuals, we've also got a higher framerate (now the game runs incredibly smooth that even feels somewhat weird for a classic TR game), additional Lara moves, vanilla as well as modern controls that support mouse. Other than the upgraded textures and models polycount, the scripted scenes went mainly untouched. As for the cutscenes, they were simply upscaled using a standard upscaling AI.

The package includes remastered versions of the first 3 installments along with their corresponding expansions (or what we would call DLCs nowadays). So considering that we get 3 separate games and the amount of work put into their improvement, contrary to the popular opinion, the price tag is pretty justifiable if you ask me.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3] 
Overall, I must say that lately with all this trend of sloppy games and even sloppier remakes, I am rarely positively surprised. However, in this particular case we've got an almost perfect example of how a proper remaster should be done: upgrade the visuals, add optional controls for new players, ensure compatibility with modern systems, leave the original style and atmosphere untouched, that's it!

If you are an old TR fan like me or if you're a newcomer who wants to get familiar with this timeless classic and is not afraid of some 90s gameplay style, you should definitely get a copy of this one.",1708242163,1708242163,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've just played the first 3 levels with my older bro (who's a super fan and a pro at this game) and all 3 of us are very happy with the remaster. 
And I look forward to exploiting my older brother's nostalgia and memory for 100% achievements! :) 

Things I Like: 
+++ GRAPHICAL IMPROVEMENT: The remastered graphics look so good. My brother, who said he's only going to use classic, was blown away by it and has been using them too. I still turn back to PS1 graphics on the fly just to relive those days and check out each room in a new view. It's superb and funny to remember how the PS1 looked. 
+++ ON THE FLY: It's literally press one key or press START on a playstation controller to change between the graphics. It's as fantastic and eye-opening as when Halo did it. Here you can even do it in the main menu, loading screens and cutscenes! 
+++ CLASSICS: They really didn't change much at all. My brother blitzed the first level like the good old days. Knew where all the enemies where, collected all the secrets and performed some stunts they don't tell you about as memory served. I was super impressed! And it still has that spooky feeling while playing. It's such a  special feeling and they have maintained it flawlessly.  
++ 3 EXTRA LEVELS: If all 3 games wasn't enough, they have 1 extra level per game that not everyone got to play. You can start them whenever you want on the main menu. We didn't get to play these levels back in the day and my brother is super excited to conquer them.  
+ CONTROLS: They give you the choice between the classic ""Tank"" controls (using 4 directional movement) or ""Modern"" using free movement/the analogue stick. Beware though, every other button is very different and you still need to hold to grab ledges! My brother says TR1 has a move it didn't have back in the day, so I suppose they just created 2 solid movesets with everything included instead of including the quirks of each game. 
+ ACHIEVEMENTS: I usually don't care for them, I did my part of platinum trophy hunting on PS3/PS4 and it's thankless, but it's cool to have stuff to do in a game as old as this. And there's a ton: 269 achievements across the 3 games! 
+ STICKING OLD MEN IN FREEZERS: Put that old King Charles mf on ice babyyyy!

Things I Dislike: 
- CONTROLS: Modern controls could've been improved, they're awful. There's not enough control on the camera. In fact, it fights against the scripted static camera angles and you will get all turned around. The all-in-one button for equipping gun/locking onto nearest enemy is annoying and not modern at all. When an enemy dies, you'll stay locked on forever if you keep shooting, so encounters with multiple enemies are a bit awkward feeling. Traversal is messed up because you cant hop backwards for run and jump moments, you just have to gun it or slowly turn all the way around while walking. I haven't figured out a way to safely lower myself off a ledge either. And the same button for walking is also for swan-diving so I often find myself smashing head-first into a wall when I want to walk to a ledge and jump from it. And you also don't auto-grab far ledges. How many modern games restrict you that much? Zero! Not even the MODERN Tomb Raider games!

I appreciate so much of the work done to refresh the look of the old game while still keeping the art direction mostly in line with the original games while adding in a couple of quality of life features.

The collection is great as it is, but I do not believe it is perfect. There are a few missed opportunities to add or improve features that would have made playing through the games again much more enjoyable.

If this game is going to receive further patches, then my hopes and wishes would be:

- [i]Level Select[/i]

Unlockable by completing each game/expansion at least once so you can revisit your favourite levels without having to play through each game all over again. Would be really useful for getting some of those peskier achievements too! (Perhaps add a cheat code to unlock all levels if you don't want to play through the games again to unlock the Level Selections.)

- [i]Outfit Select[/i]

Unlock costumes as you play through each game so you can use them whenever you want in any game. Perhaps add in the Gold Lara and Clone Lara as fun outfits from TR1 too! Modding can already do this now, but it would be nice to have an official toggle in-game like how you can switch outfits in Photo Mode.

- [i]Reanimated In-Game Cutscenes[/i]

Probably the least likely improvement to impliment, but if it does happen; it would feel more inline with the new remastered graphics if in-game cutscenes were reanimated, just like how characters already have new facial animations during in-game cutscenes with remaster graphics on. So why not give them new animations for the rest of their bodies with those faces that still fit with the existing cutscene audio (and keep the old animations when the old graphics are turned on!) As for FMVs, I get that they'd be too time-consuming to redo from scratch, so until the source files for them can be found in order to re-export higher quality videos, then I am okay with the current up-scaled FMVs.

Despite my minor disappointments with some missing features, I am enjoying the remasters. It is an improved collection that I've dreamed of seeing happen because the old Tomb Raider games desperately needed them, and to get one made with love and care by true fans is the best thing to have happened to Tomb Raider in a long time. I absolutely can recommend this game to anyone who wishes to try them, and to fellow fans of Tomb Raider.

It probably didn't help that there was a skeleton in the level that would not die with your pistols. So all I did in the demo was die over and over again. Eventually I gave up and never bothered with the series again until the modern iteration of it. 

I figured I'd give it another try as I like classic games having grown up with original Nintendo, original Playstation, and Nintendo 64. And I also recognized when I was playing the demo it wasn't at the beginning of the game so there was no opportunity to learn the game. Thinking with my adult brain and my experience playing classic games, I could get over my original reservations and enjoy it. 

Unfortunately the same reasons I never got into the first game still exist. As a huge fan of survival horror and tank controls, you would think tank controls in Tomb Raider would be easy for me. But they aren't. And the modern control scheme has its own challenges. The game is clunky and it was clunky all the way back in the 90s. I am not judging this game with 2024 glasses. The controls are bad. And the proof is that you can pickup Mario 64 and have an easy time playing it right now. I don't get how this game even got a sequel and I don't understand what people like about it. 

The biggest enemy of the game aren't its enemies but the controls and camera. The camera is even worse using the HD graphics as it gets stuck on geometry  . I tried practicing between tank controls and modern controls and it seems they both have their own unique flaws.

I get that this is just a remaster but modernizing the controls and camera would have been the core improvement this game needed. 

The primary issues I had with the controls is that the controls are not intuitive. For example if you want to jump, you have to press jump and then a direction and there is a timing to it too. Sometimes if you're running and press the jump button nothing will happen. In modern games or even in Mario 64 if you are running and press the jump button, you consistently jump. In Tomb Raider that doesn't always seem to happen. I'm not sure if it's because Laura first needs to reach a certain speed before pressing jump causes her to jump or what. I do know if you stand still and press jump and then immediately press a direction you will jump in that direction but that won't help you on the longer jumps. It's these kinds of situations that just make the experience frustrating. 

The combat has its own problems. If you use modern control scheme you have to press down on the right joystick for your character to focus on a single direction otherwise it is very difficult to lock onto enemies. 

I ended up returning the game. Perhaps a patch or something will come out to update the controls to something manageable. At the very least they",1708223638,1708224241,False,2,1,0.483551144599914551,0,True,False,False

I'd recommend it to anyone who wishes to play the classic trilogy. HOWEVER, please keep the following three things that greatly need attention in mind:

1. The camera angles sometimes in the Remastered graphics mode go absolutely apeshit. I mean totally whacked out, to the point where you're forced to switch over to Classic graphics by hitting the start button. That really needs fixed.

2. Some items, when you're in the remastered mode, become very difficult to see. Yes, the remastered modes' lighting looks pretty, but it's fairly obvious, when switching between the modes, that the lighting style of the classic game was often built around highlighting objects.

3. The Modern controls, while very beneficial 95% of the time, occasionally cripple the player. I spent 20 damn minutes on a jump in St. Francis' Folly, smacking against the pillar like a jackass, until I had looked up a video of someone doing it seamlessly, and switched back to Tank Controls. After switching over, I achieved the jump on my second try. Again, 95% of the time it's a good improvement, but that only makes the crippling 5% of the time more frustrating, if you don't know why it's happening.

All in all, I've really enjoyed this release. The Remastered graphics are well done, but more importantly, they always feel like they were trying to bring them to a higher resolution, rather than leave their own mark on the game. So many times with texture packs in modded projects, you get the feeling that the author of the pack plain didn't like some original choices, and decided to simply change it with no understanding of how it would gel with the rest of the environment; not here. Yes, that leads to some animals looking rather derpy in the face, but I'd have that any day over some passionless generic asset being put in place of the original models.

Just a little more time in the oven, and this will be a wonderful product. But, even despite the current issues, it's a great excuse to go back to one of the landmark titles in Action Adventure games.",1708213443,1708213640,True,159,0,0.908630788326263428,0,True,False,False

This is just what a remaster should be like!
- Better graphics, upscaled textures etc
- Sound seems to also be of higher quality
- The Puzzles and everything else seems untouched

It's really fun to see that this is a remaster that really just gives you a better version of the orignal games without to much changes. There is no need to change gameplay as it's already pretty good, just fine tuning with graphics like they have done here. 

The controlls will take time to get used to. I personally can't stand using the tank controlls so I use the modern ones. Just remember that you can walk, I found it usefull to rebind some keys. There are some puzzles in these games where you have to jump from one platfrom to another. I found it easier to rebind the roll key to one of the shulder buttons than to use the default one.  

Otherwise this is really a solid remaster! I truly enjoy it and while the controlls can be infuriatingly annoying at times it's OK. 

Also the combat is kinda... Not great, but that is how it was in the orignal games and it works fine. It's sometimes annoying but just remember to save often and it shouldn't be a problem.

This is very nostalgic for me as I used to play the original as a child on the Playstation. If you an see past the old mechanic of the controlls and the other small annoying things you will really enjoy this game if puzzle games are your thing.

I would recommend you to download and install the following mod as it makes it easier to see some of the keys placed troughout the first game.

It is currently the best possible way to play the original games. For new players… it’s a harder sell, but if you want some of the best and immersive level design from the 90’s, give it a try - the games have so much love poured into them. It just might take a little while to get used to!

It’s easier for me to say what I don’t like than what I do, so here goes.
- Modern controls are frankly awful. I wouldn’t have used these regardless, but for new players, my suggestion would be to get accustomed to the tank controls instead. You will have a horrible time playing these games on modern settings.
- Some of the improvements in the various levels (usually gaps in ceilings to let in artificial light) somewhat ruin the feeling of total isolation you got in the original game. It’s a different experience as a result. Particularly bad in Egypt.
- Old graphics have a frame rate cap of 30 FPS. This seems like a conscious decision rather than a technical limitation, and I can’t imagine why. Making a toggle for the cap, regardless of graphics mode, is surely an easy solution.
- Similar to above, no graphics settings at all is... an odd choice.
- On modern graphics, at least in Tomb Raider I, seeing various items such as keys is much more difficult. I have pretty poor eyesight and to me some keys were basically invisible. A particularly egregious example is the key on the top platform in the main room of The Cistern. Not a problem on classic graphics due to the sprites being oversized.
- Use of AI to upscale textures. I’m somewhat on the fence about the ethics of AI in general, but to me it feels lazy and the results are mixed. Textures often do not tile well.
- FMVs are the same as old ones. It's a bit jarring going from the beautiful modern graphics to 1996 renders!

Naturally enough it comes with the added benefit of some pretty remastered (hence the name) visuals and it eliminates the headaches of game crashes and modding required to get the originals up to snuff. If you don't like the remastered visuals for whatever reason, then you can change to the classic graphics on the fly with a tap of a button.

If you're completely new to the TR series or have only played the remakes, the original trilogy is more of a puzzle/exploration game with action elements where you shoot the occasional enemy (usually a wild animal or some flavor of human goon) to break things up.

I'm going to be ""that guy"" and say that you should probably learn how to play the game with the classic (aka tank) controls instead of the modern ones, as the modern ones felt extremely twitchy and difficult and line up jumps with.

These games were designed with a very specific system where the game world is broken up into units of space called 'blocks', and all of Lara's movements all cover a certain number of blocks...for example, a backhop will make Lara jump back one block. A running jump will make Lara cover about two blocks of distance, etc. It's harder to ""see"" the blocks because the seams of the level geometry have been erased with the graphical upgrade, but you still lose all of the nuance (and there for all the solutions intended by the OG devs) with the modern controls and it actually makes the game harder than it should be.

Might be my bias seeing how I put so much time into the PS1 classics, so take it for whatever it's worth.",1708154293,1708211239,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Update on my review: Decided to try new game + on TR1 and discovered to my horror that New Game + on the remasters are not the same as the original games. You do not get infinite ammo when you start New Game + and the enemies are harder as well as other increases in difficulty. Keep this in mind if you want to try New Game +.

Firstly, and fairly unavoidably, the gameplay does not hold up in 2024 (I say this as someone who played these games on the playstation 1 and enjoyed them then).

More concerningly, this is quite a poor remaster job. The textures have been dressed up and Lara looks more modern but the actual graphics are still very block based. The modern controls are poor and often quite unresponsive, After less than an hour of playing I had already got stuck in a wall when trying to exit the water and fortunately this was fixed when I entered and reentered the camera mode because you can't restart each level, you can only reload saves.

- Appears to have the original awkward movement and camera controls for the character and while this makes sense for it being an old school game I would imagine this would have been updated to be slightly more fluid or perhaps a toggle in the game settings to improve it but some might prefer the original I suppose. To me it is frustrating even as an old school style gamer. However, this does make it extremely challenging so maybe it's not such a bad thing. 
- Game was remastered but not the in-game video cutscenes and they show the old game style which is a bit disappointing as I would imagine this being done for the entire game. Not a huge deal though.

Let's start with the good.
The updated graphics/models are pretty good for a 25 year old game. The original Lara is the real Lara with twin pistols and side/back flips. It brings back a heap of nostalgia from exploring and solving puzzles.

I've replayed and completed the original steam version again in 2014, but there is now something about the controls that is just simply outdated. Since 2014 I've been playing a lot of FromSoft titles and the controls of this game is just poorly done. I was excited to find the modern controls, but there are issues. During combat, you can't lock on a target, and you don't face one directions either when holding your guns. Then you end up running in circles just to get line of sight of the target. There is no way to backstep off an edge and grab it. Lastly the camera gets confused in smaller spaces such as narrow passages with angles in. When the camera gets off, you can ""reset"" the camera by entering look mode and back out again, but if you don't do that, then pressing forward does not move the character forward or even in the direction of your camera.

These might be small issues, but it affects the gameplay so heavily, I got this to play on the steam deck and prefer to use a comtroller instead a keyboard and mouse, but the controller is not fun to play with in this current configuration.",1708160493,1708201838,False,1,0,0.476151973009109497,0,True,False,False

Take the time to understand Lara's movements in relationship to the square mapping of her environments. Trust me, it all falls into place. 

I last played through the original Tomb Raider trilogy in 2019 using the Steam ports of the games.
They were a jank experience that took some modifying to get working, but at the time, allowed me to revisit this unquestionable titan of gaming's history.

The first game Tomb Raider is perhaps the jankiest of the three, but it is also the purest in terms of its level design. Even in 2019 I was floored by how perfectly the levels play out and wrap around themselves as the puzzles unfold and progress is made.  TRII has the most iconic locations and outfits. TRIII is the most far out.

I haven't really played the game much at all yet. As someone who first picked up Tomb Raider in 1997, some few months after its original release, I am just so happy that many younger people will finally get a chance to experience this crucial moment in gaming history.

My testing has been flawless so far. Game looks gorgeous. PS5 controller works. The soundtrack feels like it has been remastered and kept exactly as it was, only sharper. There's literally hundreds of added achievements for me to get stuck in to to give this new remaster significantly more replay-ability.  I cannot wait to see how they have redone the Atlantis levels (if you know, you know). Yeah, I couldn't be happier with this.

Game itself is fun and remaster is generally done really well. Unfortunately, I was drawn in to the remasters because of the Modern Controls they advertised...
Modern controls are legit broken and I'm surprised I don't see more threads about it. You cannot even pass the tutorial for TR1 with Modern Controls. You are supposed to hold the action button to grab ledges, but this does not register during long jumps with the Modern control scheme so you will never grab ledges. I repeat: you cannot activate the ""Lara extending her arms to grab ledges"" pose with Modern controls, so you literally cannot play the game or even pass the tutorial. I'm using tank for now, but It's honestly shocking how this got past QA. I'll update review when this is fixed. This is just up here as a warning for new buyers so you know what you are getting into. Tank controls are a must at the moment.

EDIT: apparently you can grab ledges with modern controls by pressing a different button than the tutorial tells you to press, but only when in Modern Controls is the tutorial incorrect. Staying thumbs down until I see patch notes that say they've fixed the tutorial. 
There are also other oddities about the Modern Controls that require work-arounds to get the same capabilities as in tank Controls. There are some good guides on Steam about this if you choose to use Modern controls.",1708109580,1708198318,False,135,24,0.60130608081817627,27,True,False,False

There is so much love in the remastered graphics and native controller, widescreen and, hd support. My dad was a fan of this  game when I  was little and this remaster really does capture the way I remember the game looking from when I was that age due to rose tinted glasses . Its also very easy to run, of course my dad bought this game as well and of course we are going back through each one together. The most surprising thing is that the game holds up pretty well, especially if you are already a classic gamer. The game can be tough, but honestly you can save anywhere and almost all enemies can be killed with your basic guns if you think about how to approach and tackle them so I think the games are a bit easy for the most part unless you are trying to challenge yourself with limited saves. All around its a good remaster for a good old set of games. Well except for the third game, its cruel and unusual and only for sadists. All jokes aside, I think the old controls are the way to go in this version of the game, the modern controls lack back hop as far as I can tell and that really hurts since the game was designed with that in mind. Actually I wish that there was a control toggle on the controller settings in real time so you could go back and forth without pausing the game. It would probably break the whole balance of the game though. One other minor change is that Lara can twist in mid air now and she couldn't before so that does change how the game is played some in Tomb Raider 1.

My only complaint is that the lighting, though more realistic and beautiful, can sometimes be too dark. Causing me to briefly switch to the classic graphics to be able to see anything. Though it's made in the blink of an eye with a single button, so it was not that big of a deal.

The controls are exactly the same as the original games, and they were made for those type of controls. You're likely not to like it if you don't like tank controls, which work great for this type of slow paced grid based movement game. Don't bother with the modern controls.

There is a disclaimer by Crystal Dynamics the first time you open the game, which made me laugh, such weirdos lol you can tell they don't like the old games.

And I gotta say, Atlantis looks very creepy with the new graphics, and I love it.

Honestly as fun as the Survivor trilogy was, I've played those games because they looked fun and reminded me of Uncharted, NOT because of that fake whinny Lara.

I haven't played the originals, honestly, but you can switch seamlessly between the two versions, making the old game playable on modern machines - issues free.

My main gripe is the modern camera - it autorotates on every corner/wall and twitches. I have an ultrawide monitor, which increases the FOV naturally and thus the camera MIGHT trigger some camera auto rotation triggers, but the camera twitches on almost every corner. This, with the older movement design in the game makes you so that you miss 60% of the jumps you take. Imagine this - frustrating jumps made even more frustrating by a camera that auto rotates, making you take double the time to do a task. With the modern controls, the movement is based on the camera, so that is a huge issue, yet it is understandable why the developers haven't caught it if it is caused by the weirder aspect ratio.

A fix would be needed or at the very least a toggle to disable ALL camera assists. I can move the camera on my own, thanks. Additionally, in tight spaces (which there are a lot of), the camera controls are... inverted?

However, one significant issue I currently have with it is the modern controls. I opted for this version precisely because of the new control system, as I didn't want to struggle through those ancient tank controls. Unfortunately, the modern controls are incomplete and lack certain moves, such as side-stepping. Additionally, if you want to side-jump or backflip, you need to have your guns out, which feels forced and not well thought out.

Another issue is the camera, particularly evident in the waterfall level at the beginning where you have to jump over the waterfall stream below you. These are easy jumps, but due to the tight corners, the camera randomly jumps back and forth and doesn't seem to know what to do in such situations.

These annoyances significantly affect the quality of life, and after failing the same jumps multiple times, I closed the game because I know the mechanics will become even more challenging.

I don't love the remastered visuals, especially regarding their use of A.I art, which I guess I understand as the publisher is definitely not pumping THAT much money into old-ass Tomb Raider that only me and the rest of the retirement community will care about.

Controls are generally fine, camera is as wonky as I remember lol. I tried the modern control scheme and I didn't like it so I went back to the original controls and have had no issues on my xb1 controller.

I really like how you can toggle between the new and original graphics on the fly with one button.

Some areas are really dark in the remastered graphics but I suppose that is to add contrast in the lighting. By design, enclosed rooms that would have no ""natural"" lighting in the classic game have been altered cosmetically by opening some ceilings and adding a sky backdrop to allow shadows and light beams/reflections to appear more natural.

For those that didn't play the original titles, be warned that these games don't really hold your hand like a lot of modern games. Drop 40 feet? Dead. Miss a jump by an inch and fall into a spike pit? Dead. Run out of meds and special ammo? Tough shit. I wouldn't say it's as brutal as Souls-like games but there is definitely a learning curve to the platforming, combat, and general puzzle strategies. The only saving grace for newer players is that you can save and load without having to use fixed floating save crystals like in the original. This saves A LOT of time so you're not repeating the same 5 jumps, killing the same 4 dudes, and retrieving the same key to a door just to get back to where you screwed up a jump.

Overall, I think $30 is a fair price (a little less if you preordered) for this game considering the minor quality of life changes Aspyr has made.

The levels all look and feel the same. The art team did such an amazing job, at bringing old school Lara Croft back to new life. To say I am entirely emerged, when playing the remastered series of Tomb Raider I-III, is an understatement, and a true testimony to just how good, these late 90's titles really are!

My journey into gaming, started with Tomb Raider's original release in 1996. I cannot stop smiling when playing this!.. This nearly 30 years old game, which somehow was polished just enough, to look great on a large ultra wide monitor, whilst maintaining the feel of the original 90's icon!

In addition to the visual upgrades, this remastered version of I-III has received, it also offers an alternative, to the original control input, with which we are all too familiar! (Arrow keys, Shift, Space, Alt, Ctrl). You can now take the journey with Lara, using WASD + Mouse. As someone who played all 3 of these games in the 90's, these updated controls, do come with a few issues and challenges, when navigating small corridors, and tiny spaces. Luckily we can still play it, with the original control inputs, or a controller, should you prefer.

Needless to say? I cannot recommend this enough!
To any Tomb Raider fan, or just you, with an interest in classic titles.
This is an absolute must have experience!

Note (2/17/2024):
The game seemingly at random, every once in a while freeze for half a second. When this happens, anything you are currently pressing, is released.

So what I did first was to visit all Lara's homes and locking Winston where it was possible. I was disappointed at first that I didn't get the achievement so I had to do some reading and unfortunately spoiled myself some things about this release (but it only made me want to play more). 

[May contain spoilers ahead]


For example, I discovered that you get achievement for NOT killing the T-Rex! It was my first time in 25 years and many play throughs when I did not kill it and tried to run around with him chasing me collecting all secrets, it was so new to me, me, a TR veteran! I only got to St. Francis Folly but I'm so amazed already, I never wrote a review so fast and with so much confidence. 

I'm so happy tank controls are kept and not replaced with modern ones but you can switch between those. Photo mode took me a little to work on to understand its potential but I can see already I'll have lot's of fun with it in the future. 

But what makes it the most fun right now are the achievements, I want to play but can't decide whether to play with weapons or go for pistols only achievement, whether to play relaxed and get the '86 save or less' achievement or do my usual 'no medipack' kind of play (which I often go for but it required you to think and load a lot). I'm so exited about playing it. I love original Tomb Raiders, 

I hated TR Anniversary when it was released, I found new trilogy okay as a game but I don't like that that main character was named Lara Croft as she has nothing to do with the real Lara, so this release is honey to my heart that really wanted some modern upgrade without loosing what I loved most about those games, this one is perfect.",1708150344,1708163247,True,0,1,0,1,True,False,False

They could at least remaster the cinematic (they are the same, in all of their 144p glory). I'm pretty sure this remaster could run flawlessly on a PS2. Or perhaps even on the PS1.

Also another issue of just changing the rendering, but not change anything else : you can't see shit. The levels are much darker than the original, and they didn't add a torch or lamp or anything. So you end up just going back to the original rendering in order to see what is in front of you..

[list]
[*]Controls are awful. Both original and modern controls are finicky to the point where it sucks all the fun out of platforming.

[*]The original graphics run at only 30fps. Since the game is fairly dark using modern graphics, odds are you'll frequently switch around between the two modes. Going from smooth 60fps to bumpy 30fps is a more jarring experince than you'd expect.

I've played through TR1 literally dozens of times over the years, it's one of my favorite games of all-time. TR2 and TR3 I've completed previously on PS1 and I've enjoyed both. I've owned every PS1 game, AoD on PS2, I have every game in the series, both from Core & Crystal Dynamics days on my Steam account. This is easily the best looking version of the original TR1-TR3. But it's far from ideal. I've not even gotten to TR2 or TR3 yet. These are my thoughts as I get frustrated with my initial playthrough of TR1.

Issues:
1. Lack of sidestep buttons. They've replaced it with JUST the walk button, which makes both walking and sidestepping significantly more frustrating than it ever was in the original. Seriously. We have more than enough buttons, give us back dedicated sidestepping.
2. No quick save/quick load buttons. Come on guys. This is PC in 2024. It's BEYOND PATHETIC to not have an option for a quick save & quick load.
3. They're false advertising. These are NOT the originals with prettier graphics. The New Game + in the originals granted you unlimited ammo. These morons have decided to not only ditch that, but to increase the enemy health as well. Seriously. Someone should have slapped the idiot that recommended that asinine option.

Having only recently played through both the original PS1 version AND the Steam version of TR1 (patched to the gold version), this version IS more attractive. But it plays horribly by comparison thanks to the poor decision to leave out the sidestep buttons and to change NG+ from a reward to a punishment. If they wanted a hard mode they should've added it and left NG+ alone, or at least made a NG++ mode.

This is NOT a horrible package. But it is an inferior one in the most important ways (gameplay/controls) compared to the originals. If they'd fix the control options & NG+, the game would be a near perfect package.",1708153986,1708154259,False,11,0,0.53044593334197998,0,True,False,False

I'd advise the tank controls personally and of course the training course in Lara's Manor for the all-important basics and rules of platforming to know how to do it precisely every time, people are having trouble figuring out the modern ones but it's supposedly doable, just lacking a tutorial for the tricks of that one.",1708144277,1708144277,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

First of all acknowledge the amazing work of the devs (Members of the TR Community were hired to build this project). Thanks to all the team for bringing back Lara to us, in the way fans wished, you're awesome.

Experience wise, this remaster is the perfect example of how to bring back the joy of old games. The mastery craft of the original games is intact, adding new visuals, new functions (like Bosses HP and new controls tho Tank Gang for ever) and the atention to detail and love showed throught the whole experience.
There's some bug here and there and that's reasonable considering they've kept old code, TR Community knows they're going to be fix and this guys are going to work non stop to bring this games to perfection.

Achievements are a feast to my soul, giving the game more replayability, including also the NG+ function which bring an even more hardcore experience for those with the guts and the will to go through the games with a difficulty increase.

If you've doubts about buying this remaster, please do yourself and all the TR Community a favour and buy it. You've at least 60 to 70 hours of gameplay throught the 3 amazing games featured in this remaster, reaching even the 100+ hours if you're going for the completionist path and trying to unlock all the achievements.

If you're an old fan take in consideration this remaster brings back all the extra experiences of each game, as we call them now a days DLCs, that are not able to buy in any other digital mean.

If you're new and don't know what to do, changes to the games have really make them more enjoyable for new players, specially the Modern Controls if you find hard the old tank control system.

If you come from new-era Tomb Raider games, please, give them the benefict of the doubt. This is the real Tomb Raider experience, this is the real Lara Croft that we all fell in love with in the '90s. There's no more real way to experience what really is to be a Tomb Raider and to explore Tombs filled with secrets, traps and puzzles for you to solve.

All Hallows TR3 is not present after all pickups & all secrets found. Since beta content was restored, All Hallows also could have moved to its position in the London levels as so.

-No level select after game completion
-No Story So Far
-Bugs that should have taken the extra time before to be fixed before release; including texture misplacement, texture glitches and model clipping, the Z-fighting error in Tomb of Tihocan.
-A little graphical configuration would go a long way—especially when released on the PC platform of all things. Options are OK to have.
-Game uses DirectX API instead of Vulkan or OpenGL (specifically uses DIrectX 11 when game is booted (title screen and so).
-New Game+ changed the original function entirely; this challenge function could be a new mode (i.e. 'Hard Mode'), instead, while New Game+ retains its original function as so.
-Cannot remap some keys including: Inventory and Flares. Flares are now the dual-key stroke with Select (Share) button + R1.
-Unnecessarily added controller keystrokes for weapon shortcuts and changed parameters, which for me can interfere while pressing inventory while jumping, etc.

-Inventory menus for all three games are missing which are:
*Faded background (TR1)
*Wavy Background (TR2)
*Monochrome background (TR3)

All versions (PC/PSX) had it, and classic mode TR2 has the wavy background (albeit, skewed), should be fixed for remastered TR2, (and not skewed). With the presence of fans and their previous projects (Tomb1Main, TR2Main, Tomb3 project), these should have been present at launch.

-Some (renowned) gameplay bugs (or glitches for lack of a better word) from the original aren't doable, including the ""super-weapon crawl"" bug in TR3:

[While crouching with either the Shotgun/MP5, etc. — any two-handed firearms, hold down the Draw Weapon button + forward button; keep it pressed until the weapon appears in Lara's hand, then equip another weapon) crawl weapon bug glitch in TR3.
Just including some bugs is not enough.

Every nook and cranny should have been retained, yet some where left out or taken out entirely; no point in that.
You can add (sparingly/scarcely), not remove—it's a remaster.

*For those who desire it, the modern control scheme needs drastic improvements if insisting on keeping it, as it currently makes controlling Lara actually feel clunky, than one who'd think the tank controls do.

Of course, the game is designed for the original (tank) controls anyways, hence it feels fluid, and anything else would introduce issues as presented with the modern control scheme.

The drastic switch seeing Lara run a complete 360 in place shows just how strange and clunky such modern control scheme does the original design.
Modern controls also do not improve the control of TR3 kayak; for me, it made it more tedious to maneuver.

I had to stop myself from blindly praising things before simply because it is a classic, and overseeing clear, present issues.

So far beaten TR1 and done all three tutorials to completion. If you played these games years back, you'll love this.

To players new to the classic TRs, these games have a really tight control scheme, that feels muddy if you don't know its quirks. Do the tutorials in Lara's Home, and familiarise yourself with exactly how they tick, else you'll be falling off platforms all over the place and it wont feel good.

Awesome... with caveats.

Overall, this is excellent and easily the best way to play these old classics in 2024. While ""modern"" controls were pushed as a big selling point, the tank controls also offer Lara a few new moves which make her much less of a pain in the arse to control, and as a result the tank controls are my preferred method of playing (I am old enough to have played the PS1 games, after all).

However, there are a few things to be aware of before throwing down your money. First of all is the weird frameskipping which can only be remedied in you Nvidia control panel as the game has NO video options whatsoever. Also, the remastered visuals have a few graphical errors where rogue textures will appear and disappear in certain locations (jump into the underwater tunnel at the end of Coliseum in TR1 and immediately turn around - oof!). Thirdly, the ""classic"" visuals, while still gorgeous and presented without any of the flaws of the original versions, are locked to 30fps.

And then there is the elephant in the room - the cringe trigger warning. Had I posted this review a few hours ago I'd have said ignore it and move on. It's Crystal Dynamics, it's to be expected. However, having just finished Tomb of Tihocan, it turns out the game has indeed been censored. Crystal just couldn't help themselves and the pinup model on Pierre's jacket has been covered up. So much for being ""unaltered"".

Now before the usual suspects come in with the ""coomer"" accusations, I am an amateur sprite artist with credits in several Doom mods. If I want to see pixel baps that much I'll draw 'em. This is a matter of principle and even such a minor change means that not only was the content warning unwarranted, it is also dishonest.

Still, even with that, this is still a much more sound investment than whatever the hell Crystal Dynamics have cooking for the THIRD reboot of the series.

Never played this when it came out because I didn't own a playstation.

Its like the only thing they did was a retexture and thats it. The controls are beyond clunky, jumping is wonky, grabbing ledges is way harder than it should be, and basically doing anything feels like I'm moving in a tank. I constantly am stopping and she'll move back because I was trying to turn; this is because they didn't improve on the current/modern control scheme and just used the same exact super old fashioned movement that is very inefficient. Found there was modern controls but then there were more flaws still when I was shooting bats and the aiming was so effed so I was like even this won't save it because it still seems like there is a whole host of issues waiting for me.

There are little to no sounds, no music really, just Lara's footsteps and her grunting for the most part. Another example of poor quality remaster is the intro movie wasn't changed at all and looks so bad because its HD playstation poly's so we see every blocky flaw. 

The new ones play immensely better and you're gonna feel better playing them. ONLY buy this for nostalgia because even as someone who loves fanservice, this ain't hittin bro. Buy on sale imo. Mods could possibly save this though maybe. In all honesty I can't recommend this lazy retexture cash grab.

Younger gamers, aka “modern gamers” may in fact hate this release, as even with its fresh repaint, it’s just the original pc/psx releases that look a helluva lot better; all the wonk included. 

I’m old. I played these games at release back in the 90’s. For me and folks my age they hold a lot of atmosphere and weight and emotion for us. But they aren’t the products of the modern game industry with 1000’s of devs all working on them, the original game was made by 10 people. And while the product of that was amazing in the 90’s, it shows today. 

TR1 is old. It feels old. Painting it doesn’t change that. TR2 is still wonderful, but also still old. (Full disclosure: I have launched TR3 yet)

If you want to play some psx era video games with 100% accurate controls, this is a great way to do it. But if you want a better experience, I’d send you towards “tomb raider anniversary” as it’s a remake of the original, that’s better all around.

I like that this version allows for instantaneously switching between the new skins and original. It allows you to see how much work they put into it. Some areas look completely different. 

The “modern controls” seem to completely break the game tho. They don’t work at all with the math of the level design, nor the basic functionality of the game. Just keep it on tank controls and lean how to play it. 

Music is still fantastic.

Random old guy thoughts follow:
There is a major difference between the Core/Eidos Lara and the modern Square enix Lara.  The 90’s Lara is female James Bond. She’s heartless, brutal, and not afraid to merc anyone or anything. You get this told to you via very short, disjointed cutscenes. 99% of these games are mazes and puzzles. No awesome cinematic angles, no emotional damage, no epic story. Just puzzle, shoot occasionally, maze, repeat. These are games as they used to be. For better or worse. 

Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE the square Enix boot of Lara. Some of the best games I’ve ever played. But I do miss her Bond persona a lot. I’d like them to split that universe into like the 616 and ultimate universe from back in the day.

Today I can confidently say that remasters has preserved every bit of the original series' quality and atmosphere. Updated textures look surprisingly good. Other effects such as fog, light rays, and small map updates (like making light in caves look more natural by adding sky openings in a ceiling) are a nice addition. However, general gameplay, puzzles, cutscenes, sounds, controls, and overall feel of the game remained unchanged. You can switch to classic graphics anytime by pressing F1, which allows you to instantly note the difference and appreciate every effort the devs put into this game. On top of that there are 200+ in-game achievements encouraging exploration and different playstyles. This is how you do a classic remaster. And oh, did I mention the music is absolutely stellar?

Consider this your history lesson in video games, kids. 

PS: Just use tank controls; the modern version is heinous in its current state and more or less defeats the purpose of a new set since the games don't accomodate the way its implemented (old school grid system doesn't allow for a free flow type of movement; this needs a lot of love to work properly).

gives you a retro to modern toggle, 

adds over 260 achievements which are nods to all sorts of trivia and glitches in the trio of games

I am truly blown away by how engaging and enjoyable the original Tomb Raider has been so far. To be clear this is not a game I played growing up this is a first time for me. I am also playing with the classic or ""tank"" controls. Now for sure there is a learning curve here and  after several hours I have finally gotten comfortable in the control scheme. I attempted too play with the modern control option but it doesn't allow you to easily utilize all of Laura's movement options. Also the camera tends to get stuck in the environment a lot in the modern option, not as much in the classic controls. 

I can honestly see now why Crystal Dynamics was trying too bury this remaster. It is truly orders of magnitude more engaging then the Tomb Raider reboots. This game respects you as a player. No hand holds, no map, no difficulty modes etc. It actually respects that you as a player can think and solve its puzzles and combat on your own! What a breath of fresh air in this modern gaming wasteland! A game that doesn't play itself! In many ways, as dumb as this may sound, it hooks me like a Souls game. It's hard and mysterious but just draws you into this trance like gameplay loop of real deal exploration and discovery. Beating a difficult puzzle rewards you with progress and, if your lucky, the games beautiful theme song will play as you discover a new area.

To be clear this is a difficult game with a steep learning curve. Once you get past that curve you will be engaged in one of the most engaging action puzzle adventure games ever made. If you have a modern attention span you will not be physically capable of playing this game. 

This is an in progress review because I am still working my way through the first game. I am beyond excited to tackle 2 and 3. The graphical remaster is fantastic and is truly an accurate representation of the original game. Switching back and forth between the original graphics the remastered really shows an almost obsessive level of attention too detail of the original games graphical styling. 

The true Tomb Raider games my have just jumped their way onto my all time top 10 list. Compelling, engaging, engrossing, beautiful, respectful. Truly a game that was ahead of it's time when it originally released. It's a real shame that the modern reboot series is just a boring third person shooter with a fake ass Laura Croft.

When I first started playing, Lara was able to roll forward in a somersault. This move has mysteriously stopped working. Also, what is the hotkey for the flare? Where is quick save? Both of these need implementation.

Combat is terrible because Lara won't stay locked onto a target. Well...sometimes she does, and sometimes she doesn't.

I feel like Aspyr should have just left the camera alone instead of trying to get cute. It's really a mess.

If you want to relive these older games, I suggest downloading OpenLara (it's free). There is also a free upscale version of TR2 somewhere online. Both are better than what we have here.

If you are on the fence about getting this game (especially if you have not played these games before and are worried about the controls), please consider reading this review, and hopefully I can convince you that these games are masterpieces worth playing even now. If you are a returning player, I urge you to get this game, it really is worth it, there is a lot to love here for you especially. I wrote the entire first half of this review (turned essay) to address any concerns regarding the controls, and hopefully I can help you get off the fence and just convince you to give these games a try, as I am aware it may seem daunting as someone new to these games.

First, I want to address the aforementioned biggest factor that might have you on the fence as a new player, and that factor is: the controls.
If you are new and are scared of the controls, especially if you have read some of the other negative reviews, I promise you that it is not as hard as it seems and that once it finally clicks for you, you will love it. As someone who hadn't played a single Tomb Raider game prior to 2020 and had never played any game with tank controls and picked the first game as my introduction to the franchise, I can tell you that these games became (probably) my favorite single player games ever and they are worthwhile for newcomes like I was. Originally, I just thought, ""Hey, these games are popular, I wanna try one, so I might as well start with the first one."" So yes, I had ZERO experience beforehand, and I can safely say I still ended up loving it, so don't think it's about nostalgia. It definitely WILL take you a few hours to get used to it since the controls are foreign nowadays, but if you give it a chance and stick with it, it will become second nature and one of the best part of the games that will make you want to come back for more.

If your situation is anything like mine and you are new to the original games, you will get super frustrated with the controls for sure, I sure remember almost rage-quitting on the second level of Peru where you have to climb that ONE room with the water on the bottom. Even grabbing items was hard and frustrating for quite a while. If you try this game, you will probably have a similar experience, but if you get through that first section, you will come to find that the controls will start feeling super comfortable after a few hours. I specifically remember needing up until mid-Greece levels to get to a point where I started enjoying the platforming sections, and that was the point where I fell in love with this franchise. So I implore you to give this a try, because behind the first initial few hours of frustration lies probably one of the best games ever, and that is NOT an exaggeration! If you do end up buying it, definitely play the first game first or you are NOT going to have a good time, I can tell you that much.

I can definitely understand where the negative reviews are coming from, considering I myself was SUPER CLOSE to writing this game off as a product of its time and writing a negative review myself back when I played it in 2020, and I understand not wanting to put in those few hours when there are so many other games to play. I have no clue what motivated me to continue on, but I am SO glad I did, and I assure you that you will love this game, especially if you are a fan of Zelda or other similar types of games. I am also almost 100% sure the negative reviews would have ended up liking the game is they had just endured on a bit longer, but I understand why they wouldn't, of course.

To this day, these games alongside a few Zelda games remain the only ones I end up playing through multiple times, as not only are they quite similar, but they really are that good. I would recommend using tank controls, as both schemes have a learning curve, so you might as well put in a tiny bit of extra effort and get accustomed to it so that the platforming sections don't get trivialized by the modern controls. Of course, they can be a good alternative, but I HIGHLY encourage anyone playing this for the first time to just endure the first few agonizing hours/levels of tank controls so that you can get the intended experience with both puzzle-solving and platforming challenges, of which there are plenty.



For anyone returning, I think the Remasters do a good job of modernizing the game. First, I think the actual textures look really good. They are never distracting yet and fix some of the issues of the originals where making out certain textures or objects was basically impossible. Of course, the game still works on a grid system, meaning that the developers were definitely not able to change much of the actual level geometry, but I think they did a fantastic job for what they could do, and the classic graphics are always available with the push of one button, so you don't even need to pause the game.

The other part of this remaster I like is how it accessible these games are now. The Steam versions of these games all required patches to make them playable, sure, it was only a few minutes of work, but you still had to go out of your way to download the patches. Well, the remastered games just work right out of the box, which is a HUGE advantage in my opinion.

Possibly most important of all, the reason I cannot recommend this game enough, especially compared to the originals is that besides the improved textures and accessibility, having UNLIMITED FRAMERATE is just SO good. It makes me never want to go back to the originals, as the 30 FPS they run at now feel sluggish beyond belief. I cannot stress it enough how good playing these classics with smooth framerates feel.

Last, the other additions in the package are definitely a great value as well. Having the DLCs available straight from the getgo is HUGE, as playing them required tinkering around with files previously. Other additions such as achievements and certain tweaks to gameplay all add to the value of this remaster. In my opinion, the price for which this game is being sold at is a bargain, I would have gladly paid this much just for the first game, and having all 3 PLUS all 3 DLCs available for this price is a steal. In fact, it's basically the same price as if you wanted to grab the original 3 games on Steam, so this package is more than worth its price.

There are some negatives, and I do wish there were a few more changes here and there where they felt needed, but I think they do not bring down the experience overall. There were a few visual and audio bugs through my playthrough, but nothing major that would hinder my progress or my enjoyment of the game. It is a bit weird that a game this old can release with bugs, but the developers are working on the issues and there is nothing major to hurt the product overall.

Overall, I have to say that this Remaster did everything I wanted it to and then some. I HIGHLY recommend anyone to check this game out whether they are new or returning players, especially if you are already on the fence about buying it. It's relly great value in terms of what you get, and the games themselves are all amazing in their own rights, ESPECIALLY the first one. I was pleasantly surprised by how good this experience was. The first game still remains as one of my favorite single-player game besides a few others (such as Zelda: Ocarina of Time), and these three Tomb Raider games remain as some of the only games I can tolerate replaying multiple times, and having played the remastered version has done nothing but cement this stance even further. :)",1708087162,1708088736,True,2,0,0.514705896377563477,0,True,False,False

Yes I do have more than 5 minutes of playtime… but Steam does not recognise offline playtime. I've played it for about 5 hours on the Steam Deck while on the go.

I'm a big Tomb Raider fan myself, and I think this is the definitive way to play the game.

[b] Some boring history: [/b]I started with Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and worked myself backwards until the first Tomb Raider game from 1996, but I couldn't really get into it. I stopped playing after 4 hours feeling frustrated by the controls, and I barely made it through the first level and got stuck in the second.

[b]+ more accessible thanks to modernized controls [/b]
The first, second and third Tomb Raiders used exclusively Tank Controls. In case you don't know, Tank controls means that the player character moves into the direction they are looking, as opposed to the control scheme used in virtually all games today, where the character moves where the camera is looking. Tank controls have a big problem, they are very unintuitive. The remaster solves this problem by giving you modern controls with the option to move the camera and an updated control scheme. This has allowed me to finally get into the game, I'm already in the third level and i'm no longer feeling like fighting against my own brain constantly. Playing has turned from a chore into being enjoyable.

[b]+ Faithfully remastered graphics [/b]
The game includes an option to toggle between the old and new look on the fly, I just love this feature. It highlights how much the graphics have improved. And while there are some areas, particularly caves and the first level, that only feel like a slight improvement, many areas have become significantly more beautiful, especially Lara's house in the tutorial and outdoor areas featuring plants. The textures are no longer a blurry, pixelated mess. 2D 'sprites' (a rotating texture that was meant to give the illusion of a 3D object. A common technique in old games) have been replaced with actual highly detailed models. Lara herself has perhaps been given the biggest graphics overhaul, previously she looked kinda like a doll. Water, and other visual effects have also been significantly improved, they added small details to some scenes like snow falling in from a gap in the ceiling, or fireflies, and so on. The improvements are too numerous here to list them all. Go watch a review on youtube like Digital Foundry's if you wanna see everything that changed in detail.

[b]+ Quality of Life [/b]
The game also features numerous other improvements, like almost 300 achievements. Higher framerates. Steam cloud support, and controller support. These, although often taken for granted, make the game much more playable and enjoyable in my opinion.

[b]+ Steam Deck support [/b]
You might've noticed that the game has a verified rating for the Deck. Is it warranted? Absolutely! The original games were barely playable on deck, and had issues such as no controller support, cutscenes were messed up, inaccurate colors, and the third game had no sound at all. So far my experience has been butter smooth, and while this PC port has issues on desktop with stuttering, it runs absolutely fine on the Deck, out of the box. It makes it the best way to enjoy this trilogy.

[b]- Camera and Control issues [/b]
While the modern controls made the game playable for me, they are by no means perfect. My biggest issue is that the camera completely crap the bed once you get anywhere near a wall, which is… pretty often considering Lara likes to explore caves. This is really annoying and hopefully the devs will improve this soon. Also there is no dedicated button for stepping backwards (or sideways) any more, in the modern controls. There are workarounds, for example, backstepping still works when Pistols are equipped. Or my personal favorite, dangling from the ledge I want to jump across, then vaulting back up, and doing a roll will do exactly the same as 1 step back. But the fact that the devs just neglected to include this important function for a platforming game is honestly baffling.

[b]- Cutscenes [/b]
I don't know what the devs were thinking about remastering the whole game but leaving the crappy original cutscenes in. Much of the games' story is told via these, and they look just as bad as in the 1996 version. Maybe a little sharper. But this is unacceptable considering the phenomenal work they did with the rest of the game.",1708087242,1708087887,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The biggest issue by far is the camera. You lose control of it wildly at times, other time it starts colliding with level geometry and starts moving sporadically. Some of the moves like the back jump don't work unless you have your weapons drawn which is awkward. And there is no lock on features when entering combat. 

If the camera alone was fixed I would absolutely recommend this game. But as it is now, for those of us not interested in the classic control scheme, I would suggest you wait for a few patches.",1708085723,1708085723,False,11,1,0.569835126399993896,0,True,False,False

From Core Design 1 to 6, to Crystal Dynamics 2 Great Trilogies, even the 2 Lara Croft Spin-Off...They are all my favorite. And throughout these years, they still are my best collection and did enjoy numerous moments to replay them 1 by 1 like marathon!

Now, I am very grateful Aspyr enhanced the graphics and sound from the masterpieces but retain the original taste of game-play. 

Personally, I get used to play with my Keyboard rather than Gamepad, since it is much easier to adjust the gap jumping moves, yet it is definitely a warm welcome for enabling the use of controller for new and old gamers... 

I'm still playing the 1st game at the moment, and I don't want to KO all 6 games (plus GOLD version) so quickly. Instead, just like to enjoy Lara's every single journey gradually, like tasting a fine glass of wine~

I'm certain this success in remastering the original 3 games can lead the way to remaster Last Revelation and Chronicles in coming future. PLEASE do it slowly and Worth a WAIT!~I'm looking forward to playing them soon before I sleep in coffin!

So many things could've gone wrong, but in my eyes they got basically everything right. No unnecessary changes but instead fixing broken textures/ladders etc that were clearly oversights in the original games.

For anyone wondering, these are the exact same games with updated graphics, working out of the box on modern hardware, small quality of life improvements that don't change the spirit of the games, and you also get the expansions that were previously hard to find! So a perfect collection for either classic TR fans and people who are curious to try these the first time. Also they really listened and worked together with the community, they had a few long time community members involved in the project. That's incredible and the way it should be done.

Also, there's a photo mode!! I've been having a lot of fun with that, and it's nice seeing other people's photos as well. It was something I didn't know I needed, until I got a chance to play around with it. An option to have Lara look at the camera and a little more poses would have been nice, but no doubt these can be modded in.

Some character models are suspiciously pretty and they lack a bit of expressive range but they are still close to originals and fit well in the game, it's nice to see them in high definition. Some characters look really good. Cutscene animations are a bit janky because they haven't altered it from the originals, which I appreciate. Wouldn't be surprised if modders make them smoother at some point. Also, there are subtitles now! Makes it a lot easier to understand cutscenes as a non native speaker.

I wish it had a level select screen for levels you have already completed, like on the PS1 releases. There are some other really minor things as well but overall this is a very solid release, and a long time dream come true for a classic TR fan.

A masterclass in remastering in every sense of the word. All three games are untouched gameplay wise. Graphically they are very pleasing and polished: if AI upscaling was used, it was clearly scrubbed by hand afterwards. Sensible changes have been made to the levels (mostly, level geometry has been modified so as to justify light sources, such as adding openings to the open sky and such), not to mention finally making justice to locales such as Lost Valley, now as beautiful a valley as can be seen in TR Anniversary, and how it was originally intended. Cave openings in Peru with snow falling from them, floodlights in the Cistern to mostly justify how that deep complex is at all illuminated, and what to say of the Colosseum. You really have to see it. Mouths animate now! No more head bobbing. I do wish Lara's braid was differently done, while it's great to see it in TR1, I'm not too fond of its ""beads"" design.

Tank controls are the same as they've always been, with remapping available. A lot of people complain. True raiders don't: we know how Lara moves and how the game world works. We know exactly how nimble and precise she can be. Controls were never an issue, it just demands you to pay attention and learn them. Modern controls feel like something closer to TR Legend, and they can certainly help people not used to the classic scheme, but for me? Tank is the only way to control Lara in these games.

Some quality of life additions are welcome too: subtitles (some of the more outlandish accents are quite hard to figure out by ear), photo mode (with an added touch of freelook to explore a level ahead or line up that perfect Venice vista), an all important icon to notify you of items and interactables (some of which can be quite hard to spot), and of course, the ability to switch between classic and remastered looks for that extra level of amazement at the work done.

Audio has been remastered as well, crisp, beautiful and cheesy as it's always been. I do wish FMVs were remade rather than upscaled, but it was probably too much work to do so. Plus, I'm sure the artistic vision, as with the rest of things, was primarily to preserve the products exactly as they were, and by God they delivered.

On that note, a warning: Tomb Raider was never an easy game. It's easy to pick up, sure, but soon enough all three games show their unrelenting cards and you're expected to figure out stuff on your own by trial and error, and just plain exploring. No tutorials except for Lara's Home, no guidelines, no checkpoints. Good old 90's ""save often and in different slots"" mentality, which is, again, as it should be.

And if that wasn't enough, you have 269 achievements to complete across all three games, from simply completing a section of the respective game to outright demanding you to use a known engine glitch to reach an otherwise inaccessible pickup. The devs knew exactly what they wanted to do, and they did it.

Love Tomb Raider from the Core Design era? You must play this, Buy it. Send the message: it may not be for everyone, but there's no shortage of us classic Lara lovers out there. It's our time to ensure the message is received: we want more of this.

My earliest gaming memories are of Tomb Raider. My father and I played these together, worked together to figure out the puzzles and beat the entire original trilogy together. So when I heard that the original Tomb Raiders were being remastered to say I was excited would be an understatement.

I am not disappointed.

These remasters are truly faithful to the original games unlike Anniversary. If you're a Tomb Raider fan who grew up with these games then the purchase is without question definitely worth every penny. If you're only familiar with the more modern Tomb Raiders and want to see how it all started then you can't go wrong with this package. These are the -REAL- Tomb Raider games in my opinion.

P.S: Best played with the Tank Controls IMHO. The modern controls don't feel right for this game.

There is no decent movement in this game, its extremely choppy and feels super unrefined for 2024. I will probably refund sadly. The modern controls are arguably worse than the tank controls as well so don't think the modern controls fix any of the movement.

What they've done here in this remaster is put those functions in a single button, namely R1: to walk and rotate, you must first take a step forward, and then start turning. If you simply press left while holding R1, you will start strafing, as if you were holding R2 back in the PS1.

This is counter to my muscle memory from the PS1, where I could both walk forward and rotate while still holding R1. In this new version, I must let go of R1 if I want to rotate in place, which is weird and confusing, and creates the risk of Lara starting to run forward if I'm using the analog stick instead of the d-pad.

Another thing that is missing is the ability to use PlayStation button icons. Frankly, it is unacceptable for games to be releasing in 2024 without this option.

I wish the developers would fix these issues before my refund window closes, because I really want to play these games.

I was pretty keen to try out the new modern control scheme, and whilst there are moments where it feels great, there are so many in which it just doesnt quite work.

Ideally there would be more control options to customise which aspects of each control system you would like to use. For instance I really enjoyed being able to freely control the camera whilst moving around, however for the platforming sections you need to be able to hit down on the D-pad to jump back one square for a perfect running jump. So much of the combat revolves around jumping and flipping over the enemies, but this felt near-impossible with the modern controls as they are. Currently, the best way to play is still on a keyboard with tank controls, which is a shame.

The bad news is that the best way to play these games you kinda have to learn the tank controls. The good news is that the tank controls work so damn well once you've adapted to them. I was born when TRIII came out and had to use the stella guides to even make it, but these games are so rewarding.

The entire game is built on a grid system that the tank controls are perfectly suited for. I cannot stress enough how important it is to go to ""lara's home"" and practice practice practice all the different flips and jumps. The first few levels of the game are also simple enough that they serve as great practice for the gameplay and learning the puzzles.

TLDR give the tank controls a chance and get used to them in the training course.

Every choice taken is wonderful, giving these classic and hard to obtain titles a much appreciated modern touch (I have noticed a couple small visual errors in backgrounds that should be patched in the near future). A particular highlight is Lara's model, it looks absolutely perfect, I wouldn't change a single thing about it. For those classic fans complaining about the modern controls option, back-flips and other jumps are no longer needed now that Lara can jump in any direction on a dime. They looked cool, but if you want the modern controls then you have to understand that these are simply no contextually possible without tank input. Even still, these extra moves are fully available if you pull out your guns. Another odd review was negative saying it was impossible to exit water, but you just have to swim up and press the action button? Really weird take. On top of all of this is the reality that the original controls are still an option and they work identically to the original release.

Overall, the modern controls allow new players to not feel alienated by clunky tank inputs, the visual overhauls on the games are lovely and transformative while respecting the original vision, performance on my rig has never dropped below 4k 120fps, the original score is untouched, the cutscenes are ai upscaled as best as they can be for modern displays, and these three classics are finally easily accessible on modern platofrms. For 30 dollars, this is an absolute win for fans and new players alike, and the best way to play these classic titles. Hopefully they don't stop here, I would love to see this treatment given to the 6th gen era Tomb Raider titles as well.

I replayed TR1 for the umpteenth time a year or so ago and, however amazing the early games are, I find the primitive graphics more of a struggle to get past each subsequent time I play so to say I was chuffed to hear that remasters were coming out is an understatement. 
I wasn't disappointed - the graphics are massively improved - there or thereabouts on a par with the 'Legend' trilogy. The developers have pulled off the stunt of transforming the graphics whilst keeping the look and feel. Remember the lush green pops of colour of the islands of foliage against the monochromatic rocks and walls in the Peru levels? Its just the same but with masses more detail. The lost valley looks especially gorgeous. No black sky now - there is a moody cloud-leaden sky worthy of a triple-A. Even changing weather. Rain?! 
The remaster includes an option for you to chose between the original 'tank' controls or a modern control system. As you'd expect, controllers are supported. Having tried all the options though I have to say that the old-fashioned way (tank controls with a keyboard) is by far the best. It just doesn't seem to work well with a controller and the modern control settings are pointless because (unless I'm missing something} you cant tap  a button to hop backwards - Lara just turns around. If you've played these games before, you know that this is an essential aspect to the platforming elements. Although the square blocks which make up the game world are far less obvious with the new swanky graphics the platforming is still built around it. Fortunately, you can change control configuration mid game in seconds so try the options if you like. Guarantee you'll be back on the keyboard in short order though!
With a new game on the way from Square Enix and the promise that the time-lines are going to be tied together I wonder about the decision to do the first 3 and not 'The Last Revelation' which is my favourite of the classic games. Is that where SE are going to jump in and stitch the timelines into one (as far as is possible..)?  I hope so but if not, I really hope we get TR4 being given this treatment asap.

Not a huge deal, but its worth a mention.

This game was my introduction to video games as a child and has left an indelible mark on my life. It speaks to a time when you'd gladly spend hours upon hours navigating labyrinthine tombs, carefully setting up each and every jump and making sure to save every step of the way. No hand holding, no waypoints to guide you, no yellow paint smeared on the walls. If you got stuck, you'd be either be opening up that Prima strategy guide or making your way to that dial-up internet and looking up a guide by Stella or on Gamefaqs. 

This wouldn't normally be a solo experience either. Some of my fondest memories in life are from spending times with friends and family playing classic Tomb Raider. Huddled near a CRT tv while we all try to put our heads together to get through each level. Its a period in gaming that feels difficult to replicate these days. That being said, despite all the years that have passed and the vast technological advancements in gaming, there's still nothing quite like classic Tomb Raider. It still captures the essence of old school gaming and honestly feels refreshing in this current era of modern gaming. 

The need to carefully plan out your platforming or face certain death is still ridiculously fun to this very day. While gaming has moved past the era of tank controls, they are part of what makes classic Tomb Raider exciting. Some jumps may require a small hop, others require you to run to the edge, take a step back, gain momentum and use a running jump to clear the gap. The tank controls are designed for the grid system of the game and they just simply work together harmoniously. Once you master the feeling of the tank controls, you'll realize they offer a level of precision you simply won't achieve with ""modern"" controls. There's nothing like classic Tomb Raider in modern day platforming and that's why many people still continue to love and play these games over two decades later.  

The games look great in their remastered, high fps state. For 40 series users, you may have to switch the Vulkan/ Open Gl present method to ""Prefer layered on DXGI Swapchain"" and set the power management mode to ""prefer maximum performance"" under the game's profile in Nvidia control panel to get completely smooth frame-times. If you're using a controller, there are new shortcuts for weapon swapping and flare usage. You just have to hold your ""select"" button and press any face or bumper button. For example, ""view button+rb"" on an Xbox controller allows you to pull out a flare without going to inventory. 

I can't say enough good things about classic Tomb Raider and the icon of Lara Croft. This collection has
transported me back to my childhood and has given me that same feeling of contentment I experienced so many years ago. Its a seminal moment in gaming and I'm elated to see it preserved and updated in this collection.

I don't think it's worth £25. Maybe £20, probably £15. Worth picking up if you're curious about the originals. Then again, TR1 is 99p on sale. 

Graphically it's about as good as a remaster can get without drastically changing the game. The player and object models are very well done across the board. I can tell that there is a lot of respect and appreciation for the originals from Aspyr here, and at the end of the day this is just enhancing what was already there. 

The 60fps makes combat smoother, and the ability for Lara to mid-air roll in TR1 is a subtle but appreciated addition. (she couldnt in the original, not until TR2)

The menu's are good, though 2 and 3 lara look a little odd (her eyes off center?). Maybe i'm just used to the original. 

Having played tank controls on PC for the originals before, I can't say I've had any issues.

I agree that I, like other's just expected something more. There's no bugfixes, no significant additions or new features; I really have just been marketed the same games i've been playing for 20+ years, but they have a fresh coat of paint. Despite that, I'm enjoying the new experience, seeing how each level has been altered. 

New sounds would've been nice, or extended soundtracks. But mainly, I wish we had new FMVs. The old FMVs are timeless but out of place now, despite AI upscaling. They are in my opinion some of the best parts of the originals but they've been left untouched. 

Also where are controls displayed? F1 for Switching between old/new graphics and F3 for photomode. Had to look these up. Also quick equip for weapons, meds, and flares aren't shown anywhere (its 1-9). 

Bonuses:
- Compass in TR1 isnt uselss any more!
- TR4 style pickup overlay so you can see what you're grabbing
- Texture Bump maps and height maps everywhere. They hit more than miss, but I can tell they weren't done by hand

The visuals are incredible considering this is still the OG tomb raider with a fancy skin, and it only adds to the nostalgia rather than taking anything away. This remaster is everything I was hoping it would be.

If I have to pick a negative it would be the modern control scheme, while it's a thought for modern and current generation gamer it really doesn't work. It actually only makes the game far more difficult if not impossible as you can't pull of certain moves needed for platforming. Since platforming and exploring are 90% of what this game is, stick to the tank controls it's what the originals were designed for and they are easy to pick up with some practice.

Sadly that seems to be about it. No level select, no costume select, no cheats menu, no gallery mode, developer commantary or any other extras.

Not happy with that unnecessary disclaimer where Crystal Dynamics calls these games racist, deeply harmful and inexcusable.

Tank controls playing Tomb Raider 1 with a gamepad is exactly the same experience as when I first played it on PC circa y2k. (...including the fun moves and the classic missteps that tank controls make happen.)


TR1 was made during a time when games weren't stuffed with over-stimuation & crafting-everything to have ""value added"". A time when exploration was focus. It's basically grid-based with maps, and since you jump fixed distances, there's no guesswork and jumps are reliable so you tackle platforming deliberately (each jump is like a mini puzzle to solve).  TR1 isn't an action game like the Uncharted games are, it doesn't have fast & fluid parkour like Mirror's Edge (in fact ""parkour"" wasn't even a term used in the '90s). It's an exploration game as a platform puzzler. Because your jumps need to be deliberate and failure has no coddling, this can feel akin to playing DarkSouls-type games in that sense.

Gamers used to 2024's designs & hand-holding probably won't enjoy the original Tomb Raider games.  There are no cinematics guiding you through and there's no compass/map/holographic trail to tell you where to go & what to do next.
I enjoy the free-form exploration and freedom to get lost or not.

Hope to have modern control for the analogue stick and tank control for the Dpad at the same time, since the D-pad control what we have in the modern mode now doesnt make any sense anyway, also the modern control cannot do proper backflips and side flips and backward jump to latch on edges.

Also please fix or disable the forced camera movement for the modern control. We don't need the camera to point at certain direction at certain spots since we have full controll of camera from the right joystick. The current camera is often disorienting causing unnecessary mistakes.

They're what I'm here for. With the modern controls, it's hard or impossible to pull some maneuvers necessary for smooth play. That's definitely gonna be a pain point for people not willing to use the tank controls.

There's also no clear tutorialisation for the modern controls, so it's a bit of a trial and error thing to figure them out. Conversely, they make some parts of the game too fluid and easy - but there's really no way around that. For now, I recommend the original controls.

The graphical part is great - it's not up to modern standards, but it's up to the standards of my brain remembering what the old games looked and felt like. Probably one of my favorite graphical remasters of an older game, ever. The ability to dynamically swap to the old graphics is a huge, huge plus. There are a few spots where the new lighting is a bit less clear on what to interact with or where to go, so it's appreciated from that POV too.

Also, it's probably too faithful to the originals to keep the jumping as unresponsive as it always was, even on the modern controls.

It's the good old TR games with good old badass Lara. No modern day woke influenced whiney crap, just the way it's supposed to be.

Graphics look pretty good and it runs smooth. Makes it kinda hard to switch back to the old graphics where it is locked at 30FPS but it is awesome that you can do so with just the press of one button. Really neat to be able to see the difference between the old games and this remaster on the fly.

Controls are fine. In my opinion, it plays far better with the old tank controls but if you are an impatient Gen-Z kid with skill issues and low adaptability then there's also the modern control scheme for you. It makes it a lot harder to set up some tricky jumps correctly though and sometimes the camera can be an issue in this mode so all in all it just makes the game harder. I think they still need to tweak it a little bit... add a button to do the short back-jump  which you NEED to do the long jumps in the game for example.

Other than that, this is a great way of experiencing the superb old TR games again. Completing them takes quite some time too so you get a lot of playtime for your money here.

This is the Lara Croft I remember, stunningly beautiful, strong, sarcastic and even ruthless to an extent. (No whiny, daddy issues modern Lara here). These great collection of games  now masterfully remastered by Aspyr are the reason I fell in love with Lara and her Tomb Raider adventures. 

Aspyr knew the assignment and delivered perfectly on what we OG fans of Lara wanted. The classic games (no bs anniversary remake) are now preserved with a graphic upgrade but same in spirit and tone of the original games. You can switch between the remastered graphics and the traditional ones with the touch of button real time. Tank controls have been preserved and a modern controls have been added for those that can't be bothered with the old school controls.

Control support is present in this game as well as ultra wide screen support. 

This is the definitive edition if you want to play the classical games. 

Please Aspyr now you must remaster Tomb Raider: Last Revelation and Tomb Raider Chronicles for us. We need to complete this masterful work that Core did by making these game technically accessible to the wider public. As an old TR fan I would like to thank you Aspyr once again for doing this! This is exactly what we wanted!

I can say that this is the Lara I remember and loved. I have no interest in whatever Crystal dynamics with their disrespectful (towards Core Design work) disclaimer, are developing currently for Lara. They don't know what we OG fans want and they can keep their daddy issues Lara with their bow and arrows. I will always love this bad-ass Lara with infinite ammo dual pistols.

Great work Aspyr! Keep this up with Last Revelation and Chronicles!
With great love and respect!
An OG Lara fan!

The same classic trilogy of Lara's adventures, but with high-resolution textures, lighting, and shadows. Definitely performs better than the previous PC port. At least there could be some ambient occlusion in some places. There's also some texture pop-in's and flashes, especially in the third game. Of course, that should be fixed soon™. Very much the same games which are true to the originals from the late-90's. Nothing was left out or defiled.

I'm a proud member of the Tank Controls Mafia. My suggestion for developers is to turn Lara's character model into a tank whenever modern controls are enabled. This old-school game wasn't made for modern controls. In fact, Core Design, the developers of the original games, had to creatively make these games under the software and hardware limitations during that time. Of course, there were other games on the PS1 which had more contemporary controls. Metal Gear Solid and Ape Escape, to name a couple. The definite contrast between those games and Tomb Raider are the game mechanics. The puzzles, traps, and enemies were all made in respect to the rigid controls of Lara. There's even some sections of the game inaccessible with modern controls. This is very much a game made during a time when you had to learn movement for every other game.

I recommend buying the remastered trilogy over the older broken ports currently on Steam.

Do not buy only for modern controls and then cry after discovering the game wasn't made for it, zoom-zoom!",1707950512,1708007018,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I mean you can still play the originals, but on here they don't support controller without a LOT of faffing. To all intents and purposes, it looks great, the new character model, the upgraded textures... everything LOOKS great... 

But therein is the problem.  

I always thought I wanted a ""free cam"" in Tomb Raider... turns out I was wrong... I don't know how... but the camera in these remasters is horrendous!!! even if you don't touch the camera stick...the camera is just awful... I played the OG TR1 recently and it wasn't this bad... it's infuriating!!

They have altered the control schemes too, to allow flip-twists in TR1 and a better flow for jumping as well as offering two variant styles from the old ""tank"" style and a more up-to-date style of control, though I prefer to stick with the original style personally. From what I can tell, they've only updated the visuals, camera and controls and not touched the little details and bugs from the originals, such as a secret in the first level that you just can't get to unless you stand at the exact angle in the exact right spot in the right weather conditions while feeding a goat and singing the lion sleeps tonight in the style of Eminem... even though all common sense says you should be able to just jump and grab the ledge.

It's a good looking remaster, but it does have some flaws from its previous incarnations as well as some frustrating new ones.

It'd be nice if the did the same with TR 4, 5 and AoD because lord knows AoD needs an actual playable version... it's the only TR I have never completed...",1708006453,1708006636,True,3,0,0.500778019428253174,0,True,False,False

Whenever remastered versions of games are being made (especially nowadays), you often times hear a lot of people complain ""Why did they change this"" or ""Oh man, I wish they would've kept this in the game"" or things like that. Well.. in this case right here you don't have that. Because this Remastered collection is SO true to the original and Aspyr did an absolutely fantastic job here (afaik they even involved fans who did a lot of stuff around these games over the year)! They kept all the levels, their designs, enemies, audio (+ the bonus ones) completely intact, while focusing on just making everything look a lot nicer. <3 They also tweaked some minor yet useful things (for example you don't have to stand on the exact pixel of an item in TR1 anymore to pick it up), making the experience feel smoother, added the option for modern controls (although I highly recommend the original ones still) and a cute little photo mode on top - bc why not. :D Oh and last but not least OFC the awesome ability to switch between Remaster and Original.

There are a few small moments that could be fixed in a patch later on  - for example some corners, pits, etc in TR1 being just a little ""too dark"" to navigate and in a few places water and mud textures could indicate a little extra movement (for example at the first waterfall the water looks still although it's a current). But those are just very minor things, everything else is as GREAT as a Pyramid and I adore this collection! ^^

That being said, as an oldschool Tomb Raider player I'm taking my hat off to the Aspyr team and I'd like to hug them if I could. Oh well, maybe one day. :'D Anyway, clear recommendation guys, you can't do anything wrong by getting this! Trust me.

However, I've come to learn that this is one of the laziest ""Remasters"" in existence.

They couldn't bother to update the sounds or FMVs, so you're still listening to distorted and heavily compressed sounds while playing in a higher fidelity. The textures are all Upscaled with AI but are still seamed, and it just looks tons worse to have high resolution textures that don't wrap properly. It's almost hard to look at.

The realtime toggle to the old graphics is nice, and my preferred way of playing because of the previously mentioned issues, but why on earth does it lock the game to 30 FPS again when you do that?

Another issue I have is the exclusion of TR 4. I think I know why, and it's because they're going to be bundling what's arguably the best old TR game with two of the worst ones, Chronicles and AOD. That way you're forced to buy the rest of the remastered collection just to play TR 4.

These games did what they wanted without concerning themselves with any messages or meanings. Don't worry, this is not a woke/anti-woke thing. What I mean is this:

Ever heard someone say that Lara in the originals is a bad person? That she kills innocent people and endangered animals?

Here's the thing. When something like the Coastal Village in South Pacific (TR3) was being made, the developers didn't go ""We should make Lara go into a tribal village and kill everyone just to steal a relic."" Their intention was not to make Lara murder tribal people. But rather, they wanted to make a level that would take place in a tribal village. What kind of enemies will be in a tribal village? Well, tribal people. What kind of enemies will be in a museum? Guards.

The newer games think they're doing it better, because before letting you kill anyone, they first show your enemies doing something foul, so that you can feel like you're doing a good thing by killing them. I'd argue that we should be against killing anyone, but eh, if the newer developers and publishers want to almost-advocate killing certain kinds of people, well... it's their choice to present themselves like that.

These games though just give you enemies that fit their environments and are fun to fight against.



[h3]What are the strongest parts of Tomb Raider 1, 2 and 3?[/h3]
I'm not going to speak about Tomb Raider 1, because I haven't played that one much, but when it comes to 2 and 3 and their expansions:
- Amazing atmosphere
- Great soundtracks
- Beautiful environments - now upgraded in this remastered collection
- Pretty good difficulty curves with a decent amount of possible self-imposed challenges
- Environments that are fun to explore
- Rewarding exploration (secrets and such, that don't just reward you with a ""+1 found collectible"" number.)
- Fun and unique guns to use
And I would also say that learning and mastering the games (and controls) is rewarding.



[h3]Speaking of controls, I'll dedicate the next and final section to them.[/h3]
Now, I don't mean to gatekeep, alright, but if you decide that:
- You will put up with old level and game design,
- You will put up with old gameplay,
- You will put up with bad/old/outdated animations,
- You will put up with lower audio quality and sound effects,
But you will NOT put up with the original controls - which is the hardest thing to remake and improve, because it's directly interwoven with gameplay and level design - then do not get this game.
The modern controls suck, because there aren't many ways you can modernize them. Constantly moving the camera around is not what the original developers were even thinking of when designing the levels.

If you're new, play with the tank controls. Switch to TR3 immediately and go into Croft Manor. Go outside Lara's room, down the stairs into the main lobby and into the gym. Let Lara explain to you the moves you need to know. Follow the numbers. Do not use modern controls. Jumping efficiently, especially over long distances, requires you to run forward without turning. Good luck trying to move forward-only with an analog stick and modern controls while the camera is turning.

""But how am I supposed to play a platformer with tank controls?""
These games could, in a small way, be considered platformers, but they shouldn't. Why? Same reason they shouldn't be considered third-person shooters. Yes, you are in third-person. Yes, you shoot. Those aren't the focus of the games though. You jump between platforms, sometimes a lot, but it is not the focus of the games. Exploration and puzzle-solving is.

You're exploring:
- caves
- tombs
- jungles
- temples
- labyrinths
- mountains
- tribal villages
- military bases
- etc.
Expect climbing, crawling, making careful jumps, avoiding traps... But you are not in a platformer playground. Do not expect Ricco Harbor or New Donk City. These games are not about that. You don't merrily jump from a cloud to a question block. You jump carefully to not fall into a spike pit. You don't collect coins or moons or stars or sunshines. You collect med-packs in case you get hurt, and guns and ammo in case you get attacked. If you find a poisonous mushroom, don't eat it to become bigger, slap it on a crossbow bolt to poison the enemies that get in your way. Tank controls are just perfect for what you're going to do in this game. Look before you make a precision jump. There is no air-spin to save you from falling into a deep chasm, alright?


[h3]With all of that being said...[/h3] I highly recommend these games. Get them and enjoy yourself. If you need walkthroughs, that's fine. Even if you're following a guide, the games are still very fun by themselves.",1708002999,1708004122,True,6,0,0.529694795608520508,0,True,False,False

The ability to switch between original and modern graphics on the fly is great and graphically it's very impressive and yet at the same time, there's seemingly no options at all to customise the graphics. There's no options for frame rate, brightness, etc. It's just take it how it is and that's what we get which is a shame. There's times where I'm having to strain my eyes to see and I really don't want to do that while playing games.

The tank controls being kept is perfect. That's something that they deserve praise for so that people who played the original versions of these games back on the PS1 can really feel the nostalgia and I'm glad we get that. I stuck to the tank controls though because the modern controls are very poorly implemented. It seemingly disables certain movements that are available with tank controls and some of the controls straight up become unresponsive on the modern control settings. Stick to tank controls if you want to play these games because they are very much designed for tank controls from the ground up.

Where this game REALLY falls short is the cutscenes on the remastered graphics settings. The cutscenes have NOT been remastered unlike the rest of the game's graphics (even the loading screens are remastered!) and in fact, they seemingly are a DOWNGRADE from the original game's versions of the cutscenes. I have no idea what happened but the cutscenes look and feel shoddy and have a lot of audio problems too. This part in particular is absolutely shameful and I don't know how this was approved.

On a final note, the camera in this game feels uncontrollable. It's overly sensitive, even on lower sensitivity settings and often times becomes uncontrollable if you are stood even remotely close to a wall (which you tend to do quite a bit in these games). It will often shift when you don't touch any buttons and it makes it very difficult to do the platforming puzzles. I feel like I'm just battling with the camera all the time and that really isn't fun, especially in combat and when trying to platform. I'd often lose sight of what I'm trying to fight because the camera has a mind of it's own.

Aspyr are on the cusp of these games being the perfect trilogy of remasters but the shortcomings ultimately soured this long time fan of the franchise on the remasters.

Let's start with the positives. TR Remastered does exactly what it says on the tin: it's the first three games nicely packaged with optional remastered graphics and new controls. 30 bucks accounting for the three games you get plus the effort to get it all to work is a pretty comfortable price for what's on offer, especially given that the older games have become a bit harder to play natively on PC and community efforts to build a source port have rarely lead anywhere.

I think the modern controls while lacking some extra finesse (more on that later) are a nice way to play the games if you are not immediately familiar with the tank controls. The new look has some very good stuff going like better models, actual skyboxes, and better readability on some things that could be obscure in the original.

Altogether this is a good way to play the games if you haven't before and a very neat way to rediscover them for newcomers. Given the recent difficulties of Embracer Group I am glad this got out at all and didn't get canned like so many other projects. There are also some nice benefits like access to all the expansion content and HD voices.

I would say as far as the classic content goes, I have no issues at all. It's lacking in some QOL, like it could have used some extra bindings and a FPS unlocker (the modern visuals run at 60, classic mode is 30), but as it stands I think this is the best and easiest way to play the trilogy on modern systems at widescreen resolutions with no headaches.

The modernized content is more of a mixed bag, both in terms of visuals and controls:

The expanded visuals are hit or miss: new skyboxes and expanded view distances are a massive boon, especially for TR1 which was a very rough looking game, but the new textures can be quite bad (again, especially for TR1) and give the game a ""minecraft HD texture pack"" sort of look. Models vary from excellent to goofy, and while the HD voices are a welcome addition, they ultimately clash with the other low-fidelity audio. The reworked CGI cutscenes also look really bad, the upscaling on them is sort of atrocious whether you play on classic or modern.

The modern controls are neat but needed some fine tuning. Mouselook and being able to run in all sorts of directions is welcome but it clashes with the platforming, it should have had a button to toggle precision movement so that finer movement like strafing, side jumps etc are easier. Strangely enough the new camera does not ignore fixed angles and will occasionally snap into place causing Lara to flip out for a few seconds. Basically it's wonderful for large open spaces and for vehicles but struggles when you hit tighter environments or narrow platforming. It doesn't help that the tutorial levels were not changed or amended to refer to the new controls at all so you have to learn on the fly, and some of it is a bit unusual (like the interact key now being two separate inputs, one for using objects and one for grabbing ledges/firing your guns).

Ultimately, I think the best way to play this game right now if you don't want to learn the old inputs is to play with tank controls, but copy over the modern keybinds and use mouse buttons. Not having mouselook is a hinderance but it quickly goes away once you get used to it. Besides that, this is wonderful, I was not at all expecting the game to even have modern controls so frankly I just see it as a welcome surprise, it's what I wanted and then some more.",1707998916,1707998916,True,1,0,0.500778019428253174,0,True,False,False

I own all the Lara Croft games available on Steam, and I'll give it a bad review on that basis.

There are many remastered games in the world, but this remaster is just too lazy. It has not been modernized. Why did it take months for this level of remastering? The video is exactly the same as the original. Not only have the characters and textures been cleaned up, but the controls seem to have been modernized as well, but you can no longer jump backwards or sideways and there are too many actions that are no longer available.

If you can call it a remaster with this level of quality, you could probably call it a remaster with a set of three originals. I felt it was very malicious.

Now that we have bought the rights from Square Enix, I expect that those QTEs, which are the enemy of mankind, will be gone. However, if they released a remaster anyway before we could see the new Lara Croft, I thought it would be better not to release it.

This remaster is too insincere. It looks like a fake, a rush job.

The three games on their own offer a massive amount of content to keep you busy for a long time, but this remaster also includes the expansions.
An excellent deal.

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
The new visuals make for a very excellent (and at times, different) atmosphere. So far it's great to play with but I wouldn't exactly call it an outright replacement of the original visuals. There are things that are just inevitably lost with the updated graphics. Low visibility and draw distance, pitch black skies, etc. Things that were likely in the original games mostly due to technical limitations, but they gave the game this otherworldly atmosphere that you just can't convey with new graphics in my opinion. Thankfully, literally with the press of a button (F1) you can swap between the old and new visuals at any time, even in cutscenes.
Still, from what I experienced so far, the new visuals mostly do a fantastic job of reimagining every element, sometimes even adding nice mood-setting lighting effects.
Let's put it like this, a sloppy abomination like Halo CE: Anniversary's new graphics, this is not. Thank god. Unlike that, this collection actually shows a lot of consideration for the visuals the originals intended.
Photo mode (triggered with F3) is another addition that I greatly appreciate.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
Before I say my opinion on this remaster's attempt at ""Modern controls"", I have to point out that this trilogy is made with tank controls in mind. You can choose between the two control styles, of course. But the grid based movement is clearly intended for tank controls, no matter how pretty a paintjob this remaster is. I'm not trying to gatekeep or anything, but I think that the modern control style of free movement and mouselook is counter to the games' core design.
If you find tank controls offputting, the modern control style is there for you to try, but I strongly urge you to give yourself the extra few minutes to try and adjust to it, it's very rewarding and works shockingly well in these classic TR games.
As for the modern control style itself, I find it serviceable, but it makes certain bits of platforming a bit awkward but it's possible that this is just my bias after playing through the 3 original games over the last year (first-time experience).

[h1]Tiny issues[/h1]
So far my only issues with this release is a very small one, but I'd like to think that it should be a simple enough fix to push this remaster closer to perfection.
I'd like to have multiple bindings for a single action. Fire and Action are shared functions, which is fine, but I always intuitively used Ctrl to shoot and F to interact. As it is right now, I can only give that function a single keybind, so I have to shoot and interact with the same button no matter what, which is a bit disorienting.
It'd be nice to be able to rebind basic functions like the inventory\pause menu and item use within the menu. 
In the remaster, rebinding the movement controls to WASD in tank controls still requires you to use the arrow keys in order to navigate the inventory. (Can't navigate the inventory\pause menu with WASD) Also, the action button rebind doesn't apply to said menu as well, so I have to press Enter in order to use an item.
I also have to press Esc everytime I want to access the inventory, which can be pretty cumbersome over time. I usually had it readily available in the original with Tab (as well as Esc), so I never had to move my hand from WASD.
It would also be nice to have an ""Exit to desktop"" option in the pause menu instead of having to go back to title menu and then quit. Right now I'm just lazily Alt+F4ing but I shouldn't have to do that.

[h1]Conclusion (so far)[/h1]
I'll obviously update this review if any more noteworthy points pop up, but for now I just have to give this a thumbs up.
Despite some very tiny nitpicks I have (which I hope the devs will take note of and address in a patch), this is the most accessible way to play these three classics to their fullest.
At a time full of risk-free platformers with Nathan Drake and a bow-wielding Tomb Raider, it's truly a breath of fresh air to see the real, original Lara Croft again, with her iconic silhouette, dual pistols and sassy attitude.
As cliche as it sounds, the queen really is back.

I was a bit hesitant on the new graphics before release, but seeing them in-game has made me change my mind, even if I still primarily play with the PSX graphics on instead. You can swap between the two really quickly just by pressing the start button.

The game also runs really well on Steam Deck and has Steam Cloud, so you can play on your PC and Deck interchangeably. It also has some nice extra features including a photo-mode, modern controls (which I have, admittedly, not used much yet other than turning them on, spinning in a circle a few times, and swapping back to Tank) and there's also 269 achievements to get???

Some additional graphic settings would be nice. Currently, there's no way to change the resolution or gamma in-game, but it's not a big deal. If you need to adjust the resolution, you can do so using the Steam launch options while the game is in windowed mode.

What this is, is the best way to experience the first three classic Tomb Raider games in all their glory, without the jank of getting them to work well on modern hardware.

[b][u]The Good:[/u][/b]
-It's the OG 3 Tomb Raider games. The Original 5 games are the best the entire franchise has to offer.

-It includes the very difficult to acquire DX/Gold editions, which feature additional levels as bonus content.

-The graphical improvements to lighting, dept of objects, textures, etc really make the game look a lot better. I've been actively comparing and contrasting the modes, and it is night and day how great it looks, despite just being a rework of the classic games.

-It owns up to some of the more derogatory themes these games featured, while not changing anything.

-It runs butter smooth

-Ultravide support

-Works with OpenLara (a modding tool for the classic games)


[b][u]The Bad:[/u][/b]
-The Modern Control scheme they were trying to market on? Yeah, not great.
I was expecting at least a little bit of effort from them, but instead what we got was a half-assed addition. It actually takes away a lot of control of Lara and makes setting up jumps much harder. I'm not asking for much here. Just the ability to side jump, backflip, and backstep on demand, without having to have the pistols out, which has a split second delay that makes doing simple things like backstepping to grab a ledge on your way down MUCH more difficult than it needs to be.
I reverted back to tank and won't lose any sleep over it, but I was REALLY hoping I could finally convince friend of mine to play, who had just refused to because of the tank controls.

-The elephant in the room is that this isn't exactly a Spyro Reignited or Crash N-Sane level of remaster. It's not a full on remake designed to play as closely to the originals as possible. That isn't necessarily bad, especially given it's fairly cheap compared to those, but I know some will use it as a means to downplay the otherwise outstanding quality this game possesses.

----------------------

Overall, definitely giving it a recommend, but if you were holding off because you wanted better controls, I'd wait for some patches and mods that work to improve it.

These games aren't just pieces of my childhood to me. They were one of the few games my parents, who hate most things gaming, actually played and enjoyed themselves. It helped bring my family together, albeit briefly, during a rough spot in my childhood. It's more than just nostalgia to me, and I greatly enjoy these games, even to this day, because of it.

4.  Per example. TR3 has quick sand at the beginning of the game.  In the original, this was conveyed to you by watery textures moving. A sign something was up.

It's pure nostalgia!

I love how much love the developers put into this remaster.
Of course there are some textures that look a bit strange, but in the end it's a visual masterpiece when you look at the original classic parts. Experience Lara like never before!
Because the graphics scheme changes between classic and new on demand, you quickly get an impression of what the developers have achieved there and how much attention and love to detail there is in everything.

I also understand that the classic tank controls seem more alien to some people because many people didn't grow up with them.
I also understand the problem with the modern controls, as they don't seem to be fully developed.
But seriously, people: The game was originally from 1996 +, the action-adventure genre was not yet defined for 3D games at that time.
This means that everyone initially developed on their own until it became clear what customers/players preferred.

So this game is a remaster. The core of a remaster is to adapt the graphics to modern ones and, if necessary, fix bugs.
In my opinion, the developers have more than succeeded. It feels like it used to, only now it's very pretty. 
I found myself thinking that from today's perspective I don't think the classic graphics are that great anymore, since I can now play an alternative.
I really wish that they also do TR4 and TR5 and, for that matter, AoD too. 
Please make this possible so that I can enjoy all the classic parts as much as I can today with the remasterd!

For the classic games 1-3 you also get the respective DLC´s for your money.
So big booty for “little” money!

A clear purchase recommendation from me if you just want to experience the classic games of your childhood in a new style.
Stay away if you're just too modern and too stupid to deal with tanky or bad modern controls. 
It's better not to do it then, because you probably won't learn that in the future either :D

First things first, the tutorial at Lara's Mansion was designed for tank controls, not modern controls!
Meaning, in order to do the side-jump and backwards-jump, Lara needs to have her pistols equipped (which the tutorial doesn't allow). Secondly, latching on to ledges while walking up to walls and jumping across a cliff requires the player to hold down the SECONDARY button and not the action button. And, holding down the walking button while jumping will make Lara attempt a swan dive instead of trying to grab onto a ledge.

Holy guacamole! The developers really should've added a small pop-up window about how tank controls and modern controls play so differently! 

To make matters worse, the camera is so bad that swapping between the HD Remastered mode to the Classic mode actually fixes those issues--especially during crucial platforming sequences in enclosed spaces.

This game does not auto-save. That's right! If Lara dies and the player didn't manually save the game beforehand, they will go back to the point where they last saved.
Meaning, I finished a whole level without dying, didn't saved the game, died because pressing the jump button didn't work, and now I have to repeat the previous level in order to progress!

It's just a minor annoyance after another minor annoyance after another minor annoyance XD
The frustration is endless!

With all of that said, my tolerance for this game wears thin from all of these issues. But, I have been having fun seeing the difference between HD Remastered and Classic at the push of a button. And, I figured out how to get infinite ammo by an in-game cheat code :)

My only regret is being such an avid ""Legends/Anniversary/Underworld"" type of TR player and fan that I am woefully, embarrassingly unprepared with the controls, but hopefully I can get them figured out so I can re-experience these games I didn't get to play much of.

I can finally play my favorite ""classic"" Tomb Raider games on my new 2020s PC, and I'm overwhelmed by the new textures, lighting, new 3D models, and so many tiny yet remarkable details.
And of course, having played TR1, TR2 and TR3 countless times when I was younger (on Mac, on PSX and on PC at the time) it's great to be able to play them again! My first rerun is obviously with the 'new' look, but every now and then I switch to the old graphics (with the F1 key) to go even further down Memory Lane.
At first even just the title music brought tears to my eyes, I must admit.

I highly recommend this remaster to old Tomb Raider fans, of course, but I would also recommend it to newcomers, since this version is so new and beautiful to the point that younger players will appreciate this masterpiece just like we all did in the nineties!

Pros:
- Unlocked FPS, to whatever your monitor can handle
- Widescreen
- Performance seems flawless
- Sounds are exactly the same as in the classic version
- The difficulty is the same as in the old games (That might be a con for people who rely on yellow paint in modern games)
- Alternative control scheme which makes movement somewhat closer to the more recent TR games
- Beautiful and faithfully recreated graphics - especially the lighting makes some areas look much better than before
- Can swap to the classic 90s look with the press of a button mid-game and even mid-ingame cutscenes
- Comes with a photo mode
- All extra levels included
- An option for a little ""!"" above pickups
- It even plays fine with mouse+keyboard, not just controller

Cons:
- The modern control scheme has some serious camera issues in narrow spaces
- Some pickups are extremely tough to see due to the new textures and lighting
- Generally the lighting causes some issues, with dark areas being too bright and visa-versa
- No graphics settings at all, not even basic things like brightness


It's overall pretty good on all fronts, especially great for classic fans.

New modern controls I will gladly never use.
The new graphics look so good, being a huge improvement while still having that strange blocky ps1 aesthetic.
Being able to switch the old and new graphics back and fourth with the press of a button is friggin sick.
Subtitles, and a little indicator you can toggle that pops up when you're near an intractable is a nice touch. 
Would've liked to see them redo the cg cutscenes but I'm perfectly fine the way it is.
Sound effects haven't been touched apart from an added reverb in the graphics which is kool.
Only thing I'd like is the option to play the old graphics in 60 fps.

Being able to toggle between newer graphics and older style is wonderful. The games are solid and do stand up even today. There's a lot of puzzles, careful platforming, and combat that made the game such a success first time around. 

Unfortunately, there are two big issues that just don't work well and they revolve around the controls.

Way back when, at a time when I played the original Tomb Raider on the Sega Saturn there were dedicated sidestep buttons. That meant I could complete the first two levels in 15 minutes flat (collecting all the pick ups and all secrets). Now I was prepared for a learning curve, but the lack of dedicated sidestep buttons is unacceptable and makes Lara harder to control when walking or trying to be careful. Now this is talking about when utilising an Xbox controller. 

Now the second issue is when it comes to the keyboard controls. The remaster doesn't treat the systems as different. When playing the GOG versions of the original games - well, it is a far easier customisation of the control system. There isn't an excuse for how bad the control system is. 

That makes it difficult in deciding if I would recommend this remaster. If you care about more modern looking graphics, then yeah. If you don't want to have to fiddle with Dosbox, then probably also yeah. 

Over £20 for a slightly prettier looking, but harder to control version? I wish I hadn't spent that...these same games cost me £6.99 on GOG and it's the originals. They work just as well and control much better. I just don't think that it's worth the cost. Most of this remaster work was done for earlier android versions of the games (which I have, but don't appear to be available on Play Store any more), so the cost is just too high to be worth the value that you're getting.

To be clear - if you want the graphics and will put up with a poor control system - get this. Tomb Raider (and II and III) are good games. I just feel like there isn't enough done well with this to justify purchasing this over the original versions over on GOG.

[EDIT/UPDATE] I've now tried to use a different style of controller. I have USB Playstation 1 and Sega Saturn controllers. Unfortunately, Aspyr have not anticipated that people might use anything other than an XBOX controller and as a result doesn't allow for remapping of their controls with any form of controller. This now places it in the hard - do not recommend category. If someone wanted to use a PS1 style, or Sega Saturn style controller to get a real taste of what the game would've been like way back when - well that's not possible. Basically, lazy coding, and development. I dread to think how this will play on my steamdeck, when the non-xbox controllers don't have decent control system customizations.",1707933588,1707952372,False,5,1,0.500707149505615234,0,True,False,False

I mean if you know the games, you know what this is.

If you don't know what this game is, it's a 3d action adventure puzzle platformer. like soul reaver for example, most likely another game you haven't heard from then.  The price range is already cheap for what you are getting, 3games and 3 dlc's.

all in all a pretty good remaster, hopefully they will unlock the old graphics 30fps to 60, and it would be perfect.

They remain, and always will be, timeless classics for as long as people play video games. After all these years, the original games still hold up very well, and this new release just furthers that. The remastered graphics makes the well-trodden and worn corridors of the game after years of me playing the original releases feel very fresh to me, and replaying it now after all these years was very refreshing. Especially considering the dire state of the Tomb Raider series these days, and the so called, not remotely true to the character iteration of Lara Croft is in the 'Survivor trilogy'. 

No, this is classic Lara Croft. The character she was always meant to be; intelligent, extremely charismatic and witty, brazen, independent, successful, and a total badass. Like a better Indiana Jones. I mean, sure, there are those in modern discourses that criticise her character design. I have no animosity towards them, but I feel they are overlooking what a brilliant female character and icon Lara Croft is. Though, most people who hone in on this stuff in my experience haven't really played the games. If you were 3 years old when TR first came out, like I was when I first played TR1 with my dad, none of that mattered, she was just a cool character, and far more of a character than the hand-wringing, self-doubting, soppy wet blanket she's been reduced to now. God did the writers of those games completely miss the point of Lara Croft... Anyway.

This remastered iteration of the games is unbelievably good value for money. For the guts of 30 bucks, you get the three classic Tomb Raider games with updated graphics, as well as their expansions; Tomb Raider I's Unfinished Business expansion, Tomb Raider II's Golden Mask expansion, and Tomb Raider III's The Lost Artifact expansion. None of these are available for the classic games on Steam, and can't be accessed without installing them via any of the hundreds of classic Tomb Raider fan sites. 

I love how they play too. The decision to include both the original tank controls and a modern iteration based on Crystal Dynamics' decent 'Legend' trilogy was an idea that should be celebrated. Newer players might prefer the modern control scheme, but as I've been playing these games since the first one came out (I still think of Tomb Raider IV as 'the new one'!), the modern settings just feel completely alien to me. Still, it's lovely to have the option to play these games in an entirely new way. 

However, this remastered version of the game would benefit from some tweaking. It would benefit from the inclusion of the ability to change graphics settings and other settings, such as the ability to make FOV adjustments - I'm used to the fan-patched FOV fix and these just feel ever so slightly too zoomed in for my preference, but this is very much a nitpick. I also encountered some minor graphical stammering as an Nvidia card player, but this was easily resolved by opening Nvidia Control Panel and changing the 'Vulkan/OpenGL present method' setting to 'Prefer Layered on DXGI Swapchain'. 

If you have never played any of the classic Tomb Raiders before, or are (somehow - haha) a fan of the modern games, pick this one up and experience three masterpieces, and enjoy the classic Tomb Raider experience with the true iteration of Lara Croft along for the ride, as the iconic, badass action hero she will always be remembered for being. This is a step in the right direction for remastered old games, and for the Tomb Raider franchise itself. It seriously needed to return to its roots, and this was the perfect way to achieve that.

I remember it well; watching my brothers play it on my grandad's windows XP computer when we went over to visit. then they set me up in Croft Manor, where, after spending some time learning the controls, I promptly swan dived over the handrail, and snapped lara's neck at the bottom of the stairs. I was 7 years old, and immediately started crying!

but I kept coming back, not just to tomb raider 3 but to all the old tomb raider games because they were special to me. these remasters have done very little aside from give the old games a fresh coat of paint, and thats ok. Ironically, these games are now artifacts that need preserving, and this remaster allows new people to look at these games, quite literally, in a new way.

A brief note about some of the content and the content warning when you boot up the game; These games are products of their time, and include a lot of stereotypes that you simply couldn't get away with nowadays, especially the tribes in the south pacific in tomb raider 3. 

It would have been very difficult for Aspyr and Crystal dynamics to remove some of this offensive content,   and for a lot of publishers remastering old games, removing the offending content is exactly what would have happened. yet, instead, they opted to keep it in and add important context to frame things in a way that allows new players to better understand the time in which these games were made, a time a good half decade before I was born. anyone trying to demonise Aspyr or Crystal Dynamics for the content warning, decrying that the companies have gone ""woke"", is not interested in meaningful discussion about the story or themes of Tomb Raider: They are too busy getting mad about a bit of text that shows up when the game boots up for literally *a few seconds* before these games, with all the source material intact, can be played.

so to the old raiders, welcome back, and to the new ones, welcome! a bit of advice for newcomers: the modern controls are not particularly that great: you can't tumble to the side or backflip with WASD controls, and some players have reported trouble climbing out of water. stick instead to the tank controls: I know they're clunky and unintuitive, but in time you'll learn them, and then you probably won't be able to go back to the modern controls even if Aspyr fixes them!

As fans of the series may know, progressing in the game sometimes requires making millimetric jumps and grabs.

The modern controls in this game are a complete disaster. There are numerous negative things I could write about modern controls, but I want to end my writing by asking just one question. Has any member of the development team been able to finish any section of any game in this trilogy with modern controls? I'm not talking about completing the entire game, just one section.

Yes, visual improvements are nice, and the nostalgia the production evokes is unmatched, but a game is good if it's playable.

The controls are horrendous, no matter which of the two options are selected. If you play through the manor in TR1, Lara tells you if you run and then hold the jump button she will jump at the edge. In practice, this will not work at least half of the time. Tomb Raider always had wonky controls, but if updated controls are part of your sales pitch they need to be much better.

The lock-on aim is a joke. My memory is aiming at an enemy and then leaping all over the place to avoid their attacks as I shot them. Now your bullets wont hit unless you're directly facing an enemy. You can't jump to the side and shoot with the new controls. Even a slight turn will lose your target lock. The most basic of encounters become frustrating as you desperately swivel from side to side in hope you might attack, say, a bat.

On top of that, sometimes the controls don't respond. Maybe Lara will jump, but not walk, or vice-versa. I had a couple of occasions where none of the controls worked, save the photo mode (the use of which unlocked the other controls.)

Camera control was always an issue in the older games, but somehow it feels worse here. Maybe it's being able to control the camera, but I seem to spend more time fighting to see where I'm going. Additional scenery looks nice but can block the already annoying camera.

As for the updated graphics? They're alright. The texture work is excellent, though the few textures that have had depth added really highlights how many could have had a similar treatment but didn't.

The new lighting looks nice, but why's there no RTX option here? I've seen videos of the original game with RTX enabled so I don't see why it's not here. And the updated graphics don't include any real time reflections at all.

As for graphics options? There aren't any.

For the nostalgic, just play the old games. There's not enough new here to justify a purchase.",1707936410,1707936410,False,52,12,0.547776401042938232,0,True,False,False

Game looks fine. Not super fantastic, but actually looks decent. It doesn't have any resolution options, which is not a plus, but still, it looks way better than the original, and I guess you don't really need to change resolutions here either...

But the controls.. who was thinking that they can pass the playtest with these?

For starters, you can switch between the classic (tank) controls (arrow keys to move, alt to jump, things like this), or to the modern controls (wasd to move, space to jump, and use the mouse to move your camera, etc.). So far looks good (even though I was not sure why the classic is the default). Since you cannot use your mouse to look around in classic mode, the ""modern"" controls seemed to be the logical choice.. Oh my...

What's so wrong with the modern (mouse) controls?

So I booted up ""Lara's house"", which acts like a tutorial level, showing you how to jump and move around. The first thing you notice is that there is some mouse acceleration. Not terrible, but there's some. Kind of okay-ish, I think I can live with it. You move forward to the ""music room"", where the character tells you that if you press the direction keys, she will jump in that direction.. Then comes the first disappointment: you cannot jump backwards. And the direction of the jump versus the camera has some weird relation anyway, so you are not always jumping the direction you're hoping to.

Then you leave the room. There is a corridor.. and the camera just stuck in the doorway, and changes direction if you try to jump, suddently you are looking the opposite way.. it's awful. But it gets worse.. you go down to the main hall. Lara tells you that you can grab the ledges of the boxes. Which you can, indeed. But you cannot let them go in modern controls (unless you do a ""roll"", or climb up, your character will just stick to it and never let it go).

And then you go further.. there comes the ""how to jump while grabbing things"" part. Lara tells you that ""look, this is too much of a distance for me, I cannot jump this far.. so you need to stand here, jump forward, and then press your button to grab the ledge"". And you do not understand why you cannot do that... drumroll... if you use the modern mouse controls, your character jumps half meter longer than with the normal controls. So if you use the normal controls, you need to jump and grab the ledge because you cannot cross it. But if you switch to modern controls, she just jumps it over with no issues...

This was the point where I stopped for the moment and came here...

So you have a mouse acceleration
Cannot jump backwards
Does not even jump the same distance in modern and classic controls
Camera is awful when you are running next to a wall

Lara looks stunning and actually looks like her. Love that they let the player choose whether they still want to play with old graphics or old tank controls and these things can be changed at any moment. With modern graphics, the game will have maximum FPS as your rig can do for the game, but with the old graphics the game will cap it's FPS to give the player authentic feel of the original. Personally, I do not mind this addition, but those who do, take that in mind. I tried the modern controls, but could not get used to them, so I am sticking with the old ones. The modern controls feel incomplete and not properly explained, as the only tutorial for controls is in Lara's Home, and it's literally the same as it was in the original. Lara also can't do some stuff with modern controls like do a back flip or side flip, limiting Lara's movement variety. How that affects level progression I am not sure, but also take that in mind, you might be better sticking to tank controls if that is the case. The game itself runs smoothly, have not encountered any issues so far, but the game is basically just a bundle collection with first 3 main games + expansions, just with new look, achievements and photo mode, so the old issues most likely are still there. Game design issues are still present as well, such as not properly explaining all of the controls, besides the ones from tutorials in Lara's Home, so you have to figure out how to do some of the stuff, like swan dive, hand stand, crouch roll and boost your vehicle speed. It could be fixed later on with some popups and such, but for a returning player this is not as much of an issue as it is for a new player. I also wish there were more options to photo mode, but at it's current state it's quite nice, allowing the player to change Lara's expression, pose and weapons she are holding. Nevertheless, totally worth getting for both fans of the original games and new players who are looking for a challenge.

This being said, new players, bear in mind - This is not going to have all the quality of life upgrades that we have gotten used to in modern games. There is no map, there are no hints, there is no auto-save feature, and Lara will not wonder out loud in a helpful way if the game notices that you are stuck.

Definitely have to try playing it with classic controls but I can just see myself falling cause it takes 3 hours for the camera to turn on its own

Modern controls are not good as it restricts the player from performing certain moves required to perform accurate platforming. Yes, you can use the tank controls, but that shouldn't be a reason to provide a subpar alternative.

Additionally, there are game breaking glitches. I had to refund because I couldn't get past the second level due to a glitch where Lara couldn't swim. No matter what I tried, the glitch didn't resolve itself.

There are other issues, such as glitches with textures, limited frame rate in classic mode, skipped dialogue, issues with lighting where areas are either too dark or too bright compared to the originals, no graphical options, issues with camera controls.

I feel like this game was not play tested, and whilst it is a faithful adaptation (love that they kept everything mostly the same including the music, dialogue, ambience etc.), it is seriously let down by execution. 

It should be illegal for game companies to release broken games. I am so done with buying and playing broken games. Just do it right the first time.",1707927234,1707927234,False,4,0,0.407110422849655151,0,True,False,False

However, theres 1 or 2 issues i have to address.

Yes, game looks and runs (mostly) great, and if you love super old school tank controls that only use your keyboard (or controller) but don't use mouselook in any capacity, then you might love this and should stop reading, this review isn't for you (though you could probably have nice graphics with tank controls on classic TR with source ports + mods?), this review is for people who were interested in the package, thought maybe they could get the classic Tomb Raider experience with even some challenging methodical platforming but just controls that make more sense with how many of our brains are wired to handle them these days.

Here's the thing, ""modern controls"" gives you free mouse look yes, you can swing that mouse around and camera will turn, yay! Lara will run in the direction you're looking at, okay, that's all fine...
The issues come in the fact that in this ""modern"" control scheme, the developers simply coded Lara to run relative to camera but then gave the player no way to orientate Lara with the camera for certain important moves like backflips or sideflips or anything like that-- And the thing is, the solution is obvious! Have Mouse 2 be an ""aim"" button, one, that still retains free mouse look but now forces Lara on screen to always face where the player is aiming, and now if you press backwards/S she'll always do a little back step or if you add jump then a backflip, intuitive, obvious, simple, retaining the complexities of the original Tomb Raider controls in a modern control scheme. 
And of course, shooting. In """"""modern controls"""""" you don't aim with mouse 2, you just pull out your guns, so if you're running backward while shooting (S+M2+M1), Lara will just shoot offscreen towards the camera and not run backward while shooting forwards towards where you're aiming at. Again would be solved if you had autoaim shooting when just shooting with guns equipped (could be separate equip button like R) then force Lara to aim with Mouse 2 manually where you're actually aiming, like 99% of all first & third person shooters.

But nope, game is borderline unplayable on modern controls, I'm sure tank controls are fine for many old school players who laugh at other who don't like them and get very elitist about it, I just haven't enjoyed them much at all, Resident Evil 4 was the last game I could still play and get used to, and even that was sort of a hybrid with still free mouse look while using tank control movement, and you don't get a hybrid tank control + mouse look here, the mouse is useless with tank controls in this package.
(Should have looked for inspiration from Nightdive and how they remastered Shadow Man which originally had tank controls on consoles but they translated it intuitively for modern controls)

Some other minor things, AI upscale art can be questionable, no graphics options though game runs well so okay (though see PCGW for stutter fixes), can only navigate menus with arrow keys for that ""authentic"" experience, exiting the game is placed I think under ""game"" but that just feels weird, I didn't find it until someone pointed it out, oh, controls are buggy too, like action hold doesn't always register or it's very finicky and the camera can get stuck and sometimes seems to weirdly almost revert back to a fixed tank control camera before rubberbanding back to a ""free"" one.",1707915558,1707926183,False,8,3,0.44787183403968811,0,True,False,False

I tried the modern controls and didn't like them but I have very ingrained muscle memory for the tank controls. I'll maybe give the modern controls another try at some point but I'm happy tanking.

As with any remaster, I appreciate options and this remaster has that. Pick old graphics or new graphics. Pick old controls or new controls. Your choice. The only options I'd say it's missing is a 60+ fps mode for the old graphics and/or a low res (320x240) mode for the old graphics, for more nostalgia. Maybe even a good CRT filter, too.

Full Controller support...or Partial?

Using wired XBOX-360. In game there are two options named Modern Control and Tank Control.
Very hard to use Tank settings, switched to Modern, worked fine except for cannot aim while shooting. Maybe I missed something out, or need to remap the controller?

Anyway it´s strange that they release the game with Full Control Support for both my XBOX-360 and my PS4-Controller.
it seems like I have to use a Steam-layer and configure the controller to work properly.
This game seems not to have an ""out of the box"" full control support like other games with no need of remapping and that´s weird.

The graphics are ""well polished"" looks nice.
you can also play without the remastered graphics.
First visit at Lara´s home i noticed they have changed Lara´s original voice, that´s a shame her English accent is iconic.

Anyway this remastered Tomb Raider I-III+expansions for a bargain i take my hat off and really recommend it

Aspyr have done a good job overall remastering the classic TR trilogy, but there are still plenty of things that need to be addressed for the experience to be complete, I truly hope they will be investing time in patching the game so that it can reach its full potential.

Here is a list of things that I believe should be addressed:
[Technical]
- Backwards jumping on modern controls does not work unless guns are drawn, it should be possible to execute if jumping immediately after going backwards.
- Moving while aiming in modern controls is unreliable. Aiming should have a lock-on effect so your movement is relative to the target.
- The interract question mark icon looks a bit odd, a hand icon would be better suited.
- Boss health bars should be optional in both graphics versions.
- There are some fps jitters particularly noticeable in the old graphics mode which should be fixed.
- An option to set Resolution and Windowed/Fullscreen/Borderless mode is needed, some people like to play in a smaller window.
- An option to set custom fps cap is needed, especially for classic graphics.
- An option to invert vertical look would be much appreciated.
- It should be possible to navigate the menus with the configured movement/action keys.

[Gameplay]
- Some of the key items (e.g. the ones from Greece level) have poor contrast with the environment, making them hard to spot.
- TR1 is missing the dark fog. It may have been a technical limitation, but it gave the game a certain mystery vibe, it should be included as an option.
- Lara's pistols and the TR3 desert eagle look a bit too small, almost like toy guns. Their model size should be increased a little. The magnums and automatic pistols look fine.
- Explosions from the Grenade and Rocket launchers look very weak, the FX should be more intense.
- Lara's shotgun in TR3 looks odd, it should resemble the SPAS-12 from the original rather than the model from previous titles.
- Lara's MP5 scope in TR3 is placed oddly high, it should be lowered a bit.
- Tomb Raider 3's color filters are too strong and ruin the game contrast, especially noticeable in the jungle and colloseum levels. They should be toned down a bit.
- The river in TR3 jungle level lacks any water animation, you cannot tell that it flows. This might also be the case for the South Pacific levels, though I haven't reached them yet.
- The blue crystals in TR3 should restore some health, similar to how it was in the original PC version, though not fully, more like 25% or so.
- It should be possible to change outfits in the game once finished, perhaps the blue crystals should play a role in unlocking them.
- A level select option would also be very nice to have.
- In the remastered cutscenes from TR3 characters still shake their heads, which looks very uncanny. The shakes should be removed.",1707918335,1707919530,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a very loving remaster of great games with some very nice QoL additions for newer players, but there are still some things that could be improved.

Most notably so far being how odd the control customization and just general options are. A lot have already mentioned how you can't hotkey flairs on controller, but what I find more annoying is that there's no sidestep buttons, for keyboard or controller. This is such an essential feature as having to use walk & movement to do so is really cumbersome, and can lead to wasted seconds or improper positioning. This is super evident in TR1 & TR2 were the triggers go unused when they could easily have an exclusive option to bind dedicated sidestep buttons. TR3 there would be controller overlap, but the option should still be there for keyboard users like the old DOS PC versions, not streamlined to make the previous two games worse.

More minor but the item menus bugging(?) out to have a black screen doesn't look right to me, idk how easy a fix that would be, but it'd be nice to replicate the originals as closely as possible. There’s also some odd seam issues with TR1’s old graphics specifically, a lot of the points where polygons intersect being see-through instead of properly meshed. Oh, and please let us turn off motion blur on the new graphics, I hate seeing it even though it's more subtle than most games, and I really want to fully appreciate all the cool new textures you guys did without it on. More graphics options in general would be nice tbh, just for those who need/want them. Another nitpick, but for the new graphics specifically, could you remove the headbobs during in-game cutscenes? The new lip movements are great, and having both just makes certain scenes look too goofy.",1707918967,1707918967,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just your run-of-the-mill, good simple remaster, that doesn’t completely ruin the original game(s).

While it is a remaster, it is a 20+ year-old game, and, as should be expected, is showing its age, notably through its story and jank (there is still a LOT of jank in this remaster, notably camera clipping out of bounds/inside of objects, Lara getting stuck in objects (like the banister in Lara’s house when you try to jump over it) and Lara essentially teleporting up and down on the y-axis when there is a change in elevation.

The new controls are nice, but are incredibly flawed (especially if you enter Lara's House, the tutorial section). It's clear the new controls aren't intended for the original game and its design, as it's difficult or near impossible to do certain tricks (especially 'tapping backward' to jump slightly backward, it just doesn't work at all).

As for some of the ‘upgraded’ visuals, I would’ve liked to see a little more than what we’ve currently ended up with. My personal itches include the same, blocky polygonal environment (I would’ve liked if maybe there was a little more texture, even if purely visual) and ESPECIALLY the nearly untouched pre-rendered cutscenes. I would’ve much preferred either A - a ground-up remake/re-render of the cutscenes, similar to the intro to Quake II from last year, or B - the original files in all their pixelated glory. Instead, what we got was a really ugly-looking upscale, that from first view I think was AI-generated? (yuck.) Either way, it looks pretty bad and is quite the mess.

I'd say if you're a die-hard Tomb Raider fan, or played the original games and are willing to pay nearly $30 USD (which, in my opinion, is too much, although not completely unreasonable considering OTHER remasters, ahem), sure, go for it, but if you're new to the series, I probably wouldn't recommend it. Considering I played the original games, I'll give it a thumbs up for now, but I might change my mind, and I might even refund it. Who knows? At least I can confidently say that it's still better than the GTA: Definitive Trilogy, which is all you really need.

I still wanted to support this work, because the original Tomb Raider games, as well as Lara's character in them, are still the best; far better than the reboots developed by Crystal Dynamics.
For the fans of the original games, I would say that it's worth buying.

You can seamlessly switch between the 3 games from the main menu. And during gameplay, you can switch on the fly between the original and the remastered graphics, by pressing F1; you can also switch between the modern and tank (classic) controls while playing as well, from the game's menu.
One downside is that there are absolutely no graphics options; you can play the game in borderless fullscreen, or switch to windowed mode by pressing ALT+Enter.
From what I have played so far, everything from the originals is in there; the content and the level layouts have not been changed.

So, how do the remasters measure up?

The remastered FMVs are not that great; they are too blurry, and some of them are way too dark, to the point where you cannot really see much of anything. Modders have actually done better jobs at upscaling the original ones.

The new visuals are pretty nice, though they are nothing special; there are new textures, new models, new foliage, new lightning, and the old environmental sprites have been replaced by 3D models. Some level art has been slightly changed, but not by much and the layout of the levels has been preserved (for example, in some cases you'll see an open ceiling with light coming through instead of a closed one).
Graphic mods for the original games will net you similar or better results (they also update models, textures, foliage, etc). In addition, if you use an RTX remix mod as well (only if you have a supported Nvidia GPU), you will also get superior lightning, which can result in a vastly improved visual experience.

I expected the modern controls to be fairly bad, but I did not expect them to be abysmal. They don't work well at all with the game's grid based system. You cannot jump back by tapping backwards; you cannot do a back flip; this makes larger jumps, which are very easy using the classic controls, a complete pain to pull off. Positioning Lara in front of objects is also a pain, because she automatically turns to her side when she reaches a wall.
She also has a habit of getting stuck in environments after interacting with objects, like levers; nothing worked to get her unstuck, except switching the control scheme to tank controls.
There are many other gripes I've had with the modern controls, including wonky underwater handling, but those above are the bigger ones.
Thankfully, all is right in the world when you're using the original (tank) controls, and Lara controls like a dream.

What about the actual games?

The best one in this collection, and in the whole series, including both reboots done by Crystal Dynamics, is still Tomb Raider 1.
TR1 was a perfect storm of engaging gameplay, foreboding atmosphere, great exploration, good pacing, and an interesting story.
It perfectly captured the soul of the Tomb Raider - delving into the unknown, discovering lost artifacts, and traces of bygone civilizations. Something that unfortunately has been diluted quite a bit in the rest of the games.
It had great locales and diverse levels, like Peru, Greece, Egypt, and the level design was extremely strong, and consistent throughout the game, both thematically, and from a quality standpoint. There was a strong emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving with the occasional combat sequence, and it all felt great.
The Unfinished Business levels pack didn't really have a story, were quite a bit more difficult, but were enjoyable nonetheless.

TR2 started out pretty strong with the Great Wall level, displaying all of the strengths of a Tomb Raider game, but it slowly started to fall flat on its face. They added way too many human enemies (and combat encounters in general), all veritable health sponges. While in the 1st game, there were only a few human enemies, in the 2nd one there are tons. And with their poor AI, rudimentary hitscan damage, and blatant spawning in front or behind you, killing them is the same bland chore every time.
This is something that the devs themselves acknowledged and rectified to varying degrees in 3 and 4.
Because of this forced shift towards an action game (and not a particularly good one at that), TR2 suffered greatly in terms of the atmosphere, mystery, pacing, exploration, puzzle solving.
The story was somewhat interesting and while it did have some great levels earlier on, the level design was nowhere near as good or as interesting as it was in the 1st game. Later levels were excruciatingly dull and dragged on for way longer than they needed (like the sunken ship).
It is not a bad game, and it has its enjoyable moments, despite some of its dull and tedious parts, but it never managed to reach the heights of TR1.
The Golden Mask bonus levels, were kind of a pain. They were riddled with annoying invisible enemies, poor exploration and puzzles, and ultimately unrewarding.

When the team started TR3, they were already suffering from considerable burnout, and it showed. This one is among the weakest in the series, with a pretty forgettable story. It has less tedious and poorly designed action than TR2, but the level design and pacing are all over the place.
It started out pretty strong, with the India levels, but it slowly and steadily declined from there. The South Pacific levels were decent, while the London ones were simply abysmal (the only redeeming part about them is you had the option to skip large parts of some of those levels), and the rest, somewhere in-between.

Fortunately, TR4 was a return to form of sorts, but that is a story for another day.

New visuals are awesome. Ability to switch between classic and new visuals with a button press are extra awesome. All expansions, full controller support and all original sound and music are even more awesome.

Modern controls are pretty good honestly. Some things are easier with them (like general movement) some are kinda harder (tight platforming). The strangest thing about them is that some key movements require extra button combinations to make work, like back stepping can only be done whilst holding down the weapon button and tapping the back direction. Side flipping and back flipping requiring the same but with even more precise directional movement or by the holding down the jump button beforehand. Free camera control with the right stick is great but glitchy when in tight corridors or when the game forces a fixed camera angle however. The thing is once my monkey brain got itself wrapped around it i found myself really enjoying it.

I do like how the modern controls aren't perfect because it still keeps OG Tomb Raiders spirit of clunkiness and rampant panic moments of ""oh damn there's a dinosaur rushing me i can't get away easily!"" or ""No! I just fell into a trap or mistimed a jump and can't quickly save myself!"". Thankfully If you don't like the modern controls the classic tank controls are still an option and still work fine once you get used to them. I also like how you can turn off that new stupid ""!"" mark that pops up in front of interact-able items as i found it un-necessary and actually annoying. Good for accessibility i guess but I'm glad it's optional.

AI touched up cinematics are a serious mixed bag however. it's mostly fine but some text and things are blurred or scrambled to absolute buggery. It's not THAT noticeable but still annoying and needs to be patched. Speaking of needing a patch: some minor gameplay and graphical glitches pop up here and there. No graphical options as well, which just baffles me. No physical release irritates me even more as i'd love to have this on disc.

So far it seems like the same games we knew and loved but with a new coat of paint, content complete and with a few new options here and there. It's not perfect and really needs a hot fix or two, but it's the most complete, most accessible and probably the best version of the original three games we've ever had.

So far, the modern controls are simply non-functional to play the game. 
Basic movements don't work properly. The camera panning feature doesn't work on the old-school tank controls either, so this remaster contributes absolutely nothing that it promised other than a photo mode and some minor 3D work in place of 2D sprites.

Texture tiling issues still remain in a lot of areas, the 3D enhancements to the levels are minimalist at most,and all of the original bugs, collision and AI issues are more obvious than ever. Lara clips horridly during cutscenes, because the original animations don't line up with the new character model and no attempt was made to tweak them.

'Classic graphics' runs at a 'classic' framerate; chugging at a headache-inducing 15-25fps.

But, I don't want to rush through all three games, just to talk about them, and there are some things people need to know now, rather than later. 

First off, if you want a run-down of why ""Modern Tomb Raider"" is in the disastrous state that it is in, or why this Remastered Collection is important, I highly recommend Melonie Mac's videos over on YT. If somehow you are out of the Woke Culture information loop, she'd be the best way to get caught up on the details, involving Tomb Raider. So I won't be talking about it too much here, but it IS important to know about. 

But the most important thing to realized, right out of the gate, is that Crystal Dynamics hates Lara Croft, they hate Tomb Raider and they hate Lara Croft/Tomb Raider fans. They only still make their own ""Modern Tomb Raider"" games, because they don't have the talent anymore to make their own IPs, just like all Woke companies. And while you may think not buying this collection would hurt Crystal Dynamics, supporting this collection will actual do more harm and cause more shame to Crystal Dynamics than one would realize. Embracer Group has a grip over Crystal Dynamics now anyways, so they are not the company they use to be or have the power they used to have over Tomb Raider. Thus how we got to this collection existing today. 

Again, I don't want to spend my text here, educating, so go get educated on the topic, so you can decide for yourself.

Finally to the game... spectacular.

THIS is how remasters should be done. 

Lara looks amazing, and her updated design absolutely embraces her classic character. Yes, you will find ""higher resolution remakes"" online and for free, but they don't keep the essence of the games, like this collection does. But to each their own, I'd rather give money for an official product to SHOW the industry what I want as a customer, then to never have my voice be heard (or in this case, wallet be seen). 

That's why I pre-ordered/bought 3 different versions of this collection. Aspyr did what most AAA companies can't even do now a days.... sell me on a single trailer. I can't tell you the last time a game's trailers sold me on a game... Metal Gear Revengeance? Yeah, it's been THAT long. 

Beyond Lara herself, the levels look amazing, classic voice work is intact, classic music, tons of achievements to help mix up and change your play-style, an awesome photo mode, all while keeping the classic Tomb Raider aesthetic.

I mean, you literally cannot ask for anything more (while being realistic and reasonable at least).

The only true flaw I could possibly find, is that the modern controls are... well, PRETTY terrible. Not because they aren't well done... it's just that Classic Tomb Raider games are literally built with tank controls in mind. Stick with the tank controls for sure. If you, for some reason, 100% despise tank controls in your games, you might want to pass on this one, because the modern controls are not going to to help you. But since I grew up on controlling tanks in my games, this won't effect my personal score, but I was pretty surprised at how useless the modern controls were. 

All we need is a bit of polish, some screen resolution options, Steam Cards, Steam Shop Items, and... well, we are good. 

And as for the whole ""Woke Warning Screen"" yeah, when I see those types of disclaimers in my media, it makes me think ""Oh, so YOU don't want to me to consume this? Ok, I am consuming this.""

Reminds me of how parental advisory stickers on music, were suppose to stop kids from listening to it, but all it did was sell more of said music. 

The industry never learns. 

Anyways, I'll update my first impressions to a full review one day, or if some bombshell should drop, in order to reflect my current final score. But at the current rate this collection is going, this will be one of my favorites for a very long time. 

Let's hope Aspyr will complete the entire Sony Tomb Raider collection, with Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered, sometime down the road. 

Cheers to Aspyr for making an excellent remaster!

They play just as good as the original games but with beautiful graphics that do not feel out of place or over the top. The lighting has been updated beautifully, the controls and physics are identical to the original games but you can now look around with the mouse / right thumbstick while running around, a perfect upgrade.

- Three games and all add-ons in a single package, reasonably priced. No DLCs, no cosmetics, no $70 gaming. You get what you pay for.
- All mechanics, sounds, animations etc. stay the same. All of them. You can play these games exactly the way you played them 20-30 years ago.
- Flawless switch between old and new graphics is really well done. No loading, no stuttering - just press F1 whenever you feel like it and enjoy.
- 269 (!) achievements. This trilogy already had high replayability, but now it just reached a new level.

As it is, you cannot perform a third of the moves required by the tutorial level using the new modern control scheme and of those you can do, only half can be done using the controls Lara (the game) tells you to use. Pretty much just walk, run, and jump work as expected. You are unable to do a backhop and cannot do a ledge grab using the keybinding the game tells you to use (the ""Action"" button). 
It seems from looking at the forums that you actually need to use the ""Secondary"" button to grab a ledge whilst using modern controls. This is not only not explained to the player, the player is actively told to use the wrong button (according to the control names listed in the menu). 

Shortly after this, the game tells you to climb a ledge and tap the back key then hold the Action button (they mean the Secondary button I guess) to walk back off the ledge and hold onto it. This cannot be done as when you tap the back key (down on the d-pad), Lara spins about 160 degrees around, (not even a full 180!) and then runs off the ledge with her arms out front in an attempt to grab onto the ledge behind her. For a platforming game that requires very precise movement and jumping on a grid based map, floaty and unpredictable movement is completely unacceptable, even if all moves were possible and explained correctly in the tutorial.

I can only assume that the 94% of people giving this game a positive review  have either not started playing yet or are using the also terrible tank controls (in which case why not play the original? Better textures?). If the modern controls/ tutorials are fixed I'll update this review and probably buy the game again as I would like to play these again with better controls, just can't excuse this lack of testing/ QC.

If you like and played the OG games like me you'll like this product! Personal review done, game is awesome! 

Now for an actual review for a general consumer of this game and not someone high on nostalgia. The new camera is very bad, constantly moving by itself and clipping and generally being annoying, kind of crazy it isn't an improvement over the OG camera. 

There is no autosave function so you have to manually save each level as you start else you risk losing progress, insanely bad design and I don't know how it got released like this. I actual got 3 levels deep and then lost all my progress and had to start again because of this. Patch needed to sort this mess out. Where are the save crystals? This would actually fix this issue by itself by not change the original save system.

The new controls are unusable and unless your an OG player used to the tank controls you will likely find the game unplayable. THIS NEEDS FIXING ASAP! So many people will refund due to this and likely kill any chance of chronicles and revelations being remastered.

The framerate in classic mode is locked to like 15fps! WHY? It's supposed to be a remaster, I should be able to play at 60fps in classic mode.

The TLDR! This new remaster is a faithful upgrade to the original 3 games and perfect for an OG gamer wanting to relive one of the best classic games from the mid-90s but will likely fall flat for a modern audience.",1707909095,1707909095,True,2,0,0.532788276672363281,0,True,False,False

The modern graphics adds a nice touch that refreshes the levels' scenery but, if you want the real retro experience, just press F1 and you get the original PS1 graphics untouched. The several QoL implemented such as the action prompt in objects are a welcome additions too, specially for those who play the games blind for the first time.

Now, if you are a veteran classic tomb raider player, you can use the tank controls that is so familiar for such players. Or you can opt for the modern controls which are... Ok. The camera and movements controls well in open spaces but when you get in closed and tight spaces, or even in a corner, the camera gets stuck or doesn't control well. Also, it's not very good when shooting the enemies. I think the modern controls still needs some polish. So much so I would even suggest new players to familiarize with tank controls and play the game that way for the best experience.

Excepting a certain cringe and unnecessary disclaimer that pops up before getting in the main menu (and that you can actually disable. Just go to the discussions page to learn how 😉) and the modern controls, the rest of the remaster is excellent.

My only issue within the remasters is the water, and hopefully it can get patched. The surface texture is very off, when underwater it doesn't feel like you're underwater but instead flying. I guess due to lack of effects, blue tint etc.

Caveat: the modern controls don't fully work with the level geometry and combat. Side jumps/backflips are only possible with weapons out, which makes some platforming needlessly fiddly. To illustrate, Lara's home tutorial in TR2 has a small platforming section that is explicitly said to be ""easier done with a sideways jump"" but there is no such thing as a sideways jump with modern controls in that section, because you don't have access to weapons. It's a frustratingly difficult bit that is totally trivial with classic controls.

Another big issue is combat with modern controls. Combat in TR relies heavily on side jumps and backflips, and these are very easy to screw up on an analog stick. Instead, Lara will often make a turn to the side, precluding you from making the flips you need to avoid enemies while being in a good position to shoot them. So a lot of the time, you'll end up turning your back on enemies and shooting in a completely the wrong direction. 

Classic TR fans need not bother with modern controls and everyone else will probably get accustomed to them, but there will be a learning curve and it will not be painless. Godspeed.",1707905561,1707905561,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My ex-husband and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak girl I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the father of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The man I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

You have each of the 3 games in one place, where you just arrow up or down to switch between them - featuring their original menus as well, now with the aforementioned face lift applied. 

All of the in-game cutscenes are also given remastered versions, running in-engine as well.

You can seamlessly transition between the classic and modern graphical settings, as well as choosing the classic tank controls and a more modern style of movement controls. I personally prefer the tank controls, because they just make sense with how the game was originally designed, especially in terms of like backflips and whatnot.

 I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is an OG fan or anyone who has ever been curious about what the games were like. It also takes next to nothing to run, so on any modern system it will run at your maximum frames lol

The tank controls may feel awkward at first if you've never played these games before, but it's what they're designed for. Plus, part of the fun of these games is mastering the controls.

The complete lack of graphics options is baffling.

The modern controls are clunky and so is the camera. I'm not used to the 'tank controls' either so I didn't like that too much either. Also sometimes the buttons you press don't seem to register so you end up failing a jump because you just DON'T jump! Which can make progression a pain at times. The visuals are nice for the most part, and I liked how you can swap between old and new visuals. I kind of wish they updated the intro cinematic's to look like the remastered models. But they just upped the resolution for it. I just couldn't enjoy it. I just wish they worked on the controls more to make it less horrible than it currently is.",1707896988,1707897025,False,7,4,0.443625092506408691,0,True,False,False

The jumps are no longer as delayed and feel more like TR2/3, we now have Twist Jumping as well in TR1 which is another great feature, everything texture wise looks fantastic, so true to the original. 

And who can forget the key ingredient in any Tomb Raider game, Lara! She looks better than ever in these remasters, facial expressions in cutscenes are a huge plus,

We also now have a photomode, albeit lacking in terms of poses and ability to move her around to fit poses better it's still a nice welcome feature. 

And the cherry on top of this has to be the ability to swap between Original and Remastered graphics at any time, even in FMVs! Giving the FMVs a nice crisp upscaling which is not huge but it definitely makes them pop more.

Lastly, the modern controls are a new addition, although I have found them to be a little awkward and difficult to get accustomed to, but i'll be happy with my Tank controls ^^

All in all, so far this game is fantastic and is exactly what I wanted in a remaster of my all time favourite series of the early PC/PS1 era of gaming, definitely do not miss out on Lara's origins in these fantastic remasters.

Everything has been lovingly crafted in the spirit of the originals, nothing has been altered drastically or changed enough for it to lose that classic identity. The developers did add some slight quality of life changes that are welcome for players not familiar with these games, but everything can be switched off as well. The game looks and plays great at 60 fps and in true widescreen, you can also freely toggle between the remastered graphics and the original graphics at any point, which is always a welcome addition. (However the classic graphics option seems to be limited to 30 fps)

my only complaint, if you can call it that, is that the level designs where made with tank controls in mind, and unfortunately that does mean that with moderns movement changes it does break some platforming section's, but seeing how you can pause at any time and change back and fourth, it becomes only a mild inconvenience to this masterpiece of gaming,
