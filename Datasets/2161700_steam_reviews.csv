I will change this review when/if there is any improvement on this issue, or at least a proper workaround.

It starts off with small things that you notice:
-Junpei won't use fire attacks when it's clearly the critical weakness of enemies, opting to use physical attacks instead...

But fine, one offs can happen. However, gradually the more glaring issues become noticable:

-Shift: Party members cannot use shift or rather, will not use shift in battle. Why? This was possible in Persona 5 when the AI would somehow make a decision based on equipped Personas, adding a great flow of battle. This is unacceptable.

So what does this mean? It means that a party member will often just fire the same attack over and over until his or her turn is over with.

-Theurgy: Love this added component of battle, a nice added alternative of the combo attacks from Persona 4 and Persona 5... Fatal flaw? The party AI will rarely if ever use it when available. I have seen it used, however it's very rare. Currently I have a party where all 4 members have maxed the theurgy bar but just will not use it, even if they've run out of SP.... What is the point of this?

Basically if you play with party AI on, you are forced to switch to manual control to force them to use theurgy skills. A big step down from Persona 4 and 5 when these attacks would happen randomly.

If these features have been built in, then the AI should be designed to use them properly.

Apart from the awful Party AI, the game has other annoying issues:

-Dying and reloading: If you die, you are forced to go through the usual dreary ending screen. THEN you are not given an option to reload, but only to restart from when you first entered Tartarus. Likely, you probably regularly saved each time you went back to the entrance and therefore have a save that is more recent than that.... So when you die, you're forced to either go back to the main menu or to your first entry, and manually reload that save. It's 2024 Atlus! How can you bring in a save system as bad as almost 20 years ago?

-I am getting performance issues, occasional skipping on PC. But not that often and not that major.


Sorry, this is not good enough, especially for a P3 fan who spent 100 euros on the full edition..

This is a great first Persona game if you've never had the chance to try one. If you're coming from P5R, this game will feel a little more barebones. Still, the gameplay loop is tight and fun.

Game runs kinda iffy on Steam Deck though, especially considering the verified tag. Some sections of the game (velvet room, dorms, some parts of tartarus) have some pretty egregious framedrops, maybe due to lighting? Regardless, the game looks great maxed out on a decent PC.

All in all, I recommend this game and I absolutely love it. However, I'm not sure if it's worth the $70 price tag. At the end of the day, this is an 18-year-old game with a really, really nice-looking coat of paint. The re-recorded music is top notch, the UI is amazing, the visuals are stunning, but the story is basically still the same old persona 3-- actually a bit worse in some ways because, although plenty of new content was added, some major content from the original is missing (no FeMC/FES ending). If you don't know what I'm talking about, then this game is definitely worth it. If you've had experience with this game before, I'd ask myself if I'm willing to spend $70 to replay a beautified and re-hauled 18-year-old game.

Apart from interesting gameplay as a crucial meaning for every games. What is the most important thing to an RPG game? No doubt, it is the story, the plot. That is the key to why Persona has higher tier than other Japanese RPG game even global RPG games.

One that is familiar with Persona 5, and while it doesn't render any of the previous versions obsolete, it modernizes it wonderfully. Even if it might not go above and beyond or reach the same heights as P5R. 

One of the biggest contentions about Persona 3 as a whole was the story. While it was a story that was amazing on paper. Many thought that it had a lot of pacing issues, especially with its cut scenes. Regardless of how you feel about the original, Reload makes a lot of attempts to remedy this and to good measure. A lot of characters are alluded to early on to give them enough screen time but also not alienate the player. Sure some parts can go on for a while, but considering the story being told, I think its worth it. 

One of the new selling points of P3R is the amount of voice acting used in the game, this is the first game in the series to have fully voiced dialogue. I think this is a great move for the series as it helps keep confidants engaging and some of these moments are made that much funnier as well. Speaking of, the English dub sees a mostly new cast. Now I got the privilege to meet the members of SEES at a convention, (where they all signed my PS5) and I can tell a lot of them are really happy to be apart of this project. Some of the new voices I think are leaps and bounds better such as Aigis and Junpei. Though others not so much, like Akihiko and Ken. Overall I am happy with the voice cast and I don't mind the recast, especially considering a lot of the original cast got cameo roles ala the Mario Movie which is really cool to see! Obviously this is not a thing with the JP cast where most of them reprise their roles with a couple of exceptions. 

Gameplay is very similar to the original though with some new improvements such as balancing, menu navigation, world exploration and mechanics such as shifting or theurgy attacks that are based off of Persona 5. While it might feel a little derivative, its also important to know that if it ain't broke, don't fix it so I don't mind this. One important change made was being able to control your party members, which also changes both the dynamic and balancing of battles since now you have a lot more strategies to down enemies and take them out instead of having an AI decide based on your options. It goes a long way to keeping the flow of battles up while still feeling like enough of a challenge (at least for me). 

Music is good as well, rapper Lotus juice from the original and he does not mess around, especially with the new verse of Mass Destruction or Its Going Down Now. Although the vocalist can be very hit or miss. New songs like Color Your Night work well for her, and even some old ones such as the credits or Master of Tartarus, but then you have When Moon's Reaching Out where she just sounds like a peanuts character simply put. However overall I like a lot of the remixes and the new songs so its a net win, even if there are some stinkers. 

One point of contention among Persona fans is the lack of The Answer or Femc from FES or Portable. While it is indeed a missed opportunity, it doesn't weigh down the package overall so its loss doesn't feel as noticeable as some might make it seem. With that said, there are rumors about the Answer being a DLC campaign and Portable is on Steam and other platforms so there are still options. Personally I think this does enough to stand on its own, maybe even surpass both versions. 

I had a really good time with this game, Its no secret that I am a big Persona fan, but this is the kind of game I will recommend to everyone. Although I think Persona 5 is still the better starting point. While I got my moneys worth at $70, when P5R is $60 (and goes on sale a lot physically and digitally) plus is just a newer game all around, I think that works better overall.

I was doing house chores while he was playing it in the living room. It seemed like a child friendly and educational game at first. The characters were at a school and learning math. The next thing I know, they were shooting themselves in the head! The characters had what looked like guns and they'd put them up to their heads and shoot. I got worried, so I did some research on the game. The guns are actually ""evokers"" used to call upon a ""persona."" I'm worried that my son will one day find a gun and try this out, or try to evoke evil spirits in other ways. I learned that there is a sequel called Persona 4 where the teenagers call a ""persona"" by using tarot cards. This goes against the Lord. As I kept doing research, I learned that these games are a part of a bigger series called ""Shin Megami Tensei."" What I learned about this series is horrifying. There are games called ""Devil Children,"" ""Devil Survivor,"" ""Devil Summoner,"" and ""Digital Devil Saga"" that are part of this series! This got me really worried about what my son was playing.

The UI in this remake is magnificent; reminiscent of P5's for sure but crisp, responsive, fluid, and BLUE. Voice acting is stellar. Gameplay also reminds me a lot of P5R -- albeit a bit simplified, which isn't a bad thing on its own. I'm not too deep into the story just yet, but what I've experienced is incredibly immersive and tantalizing, just like any other Persona entry.

It was the second game from that series that I played and, while enjoying my time with that first title and still hold it in high regard, this one hit very different. It was a less refined title to be sure, with game play that was flawed and clunky at points, side-characters that were rougher around the edges, a tone far edgier than what came later and pacing that was fairly questionable in the middle stages. Those weren't issues for me...

The story of that game genuinely changed how I viewed the world. Death is a terrifying thing. It matters not who you are, death will come for you no matter how hard you try to avoid it, a certainty that everyone will desperately try and avoid. After the rocky two years prior, I genuinely was horrified at the thought and had this sinking dread upon thinking about it, my heart consuming itself in the void of its own making. 

Yet, after playing around 100 hours of a single game, I don't mind it as much anymore. The presence is real, but the pain is gone. Living life to the fullest, building bonds and enjoying simple goals, even taking care of someone for a short span of time in the history of the Universe... that's what life is about, why its worth living.

Two years later I got to re-experience this game in a remake. I can gladly say that while Persona 3 Reload has its own drawbacks in its own right, I cannot help but recommend this game. Its confidently my favourite work of art I've experienced, its theme so integral to my existence that I genuinely don't know if I would be where I am without it. I don't think there are enough words for me to aptly describe how I feel about this game, and goodness knows I've tried.",1708833263,1708833263,True,2,0,0.553431153297424316,0,True,False,False

The original game's story is loving recreated with more modern quality of life updates. Additional social scenes with SEES members really help to flesh out the cast and improve one of the Persona series' core pillars. The new voice cast successfully captures the personality of the characters and in some ways deliver superior performances compared to their counterparts,

The gameplay is also a massive step up from the original, including many gameplay and combat improvements making P3 more in line with the gameplay of Persona 5. However the general gameplay loop from the original is intact mainly how Tartarus and the Full Moon Shadows work, in fact most guides from the original game will work nearly 100%. The social mechanics are mostly intact however the social links are now much easier streamlining the games dated system and bringing closer to P5's confidant system. The exclusion of P3 Fes' The Answer epilogue and P3 Portable's are notable however I feel their absence is negligible. 

At the end of the day I think that Persona 3 Reload is everything that P3 did well while bringing the less well aged mechanics and bringing them up to 2024's standards.

this game got me crying at 3.53am

I am not gonna mentally recover from this... but this game was worth every minute and every effort i poured into it. i realize i was late to the party - i only played p4/golden and p5/royal and strikers a few times like in the last 8 years, i had to emulate p3fes but never got around to finishing it. In a sense, i'm relatively newcomer on smt games, and i never fully enjoyed the full experience of playing these games when they initially came out, only finding out a few years too late. But when i saw that Persona 3 was getting a remake, i thought this was my only chance to get it - get the story, see what the craze was about...

but holy crap, this hit me hard. for real.

the music, the story, the pacing. While cheesy and over the top, it is fitting to its core themes and as an anime jrpg, it hits all the marks. its a must-buy, must-play, wonderful and compelling experience. the characters are amazing, the gameplay of both school life and battle are very engaging, and the voice acting really brings something to my heart, to feel for these characters.

goddamn. Persona games go hard.

After reading so many people say Persona 3 has a much better story than Persona 5 (even life-changing for many), I do feel pretty let down. Overall P3R is definitely a very well-made game with mostly well-written characters and a satisfying gameplay loop, but it is undermined by real flaws.  NOTE: All spoilers are in footnotes.

Gameplay

From what I can tell, P3R makes a lot of significant improvements over P3 FES and P3P's gameplay, with more stuff to do in the real world and with more variety in Tartarus.  Combat is also much better balanced, bringing in some ideas from P5 without making it a clone of that game.  On the pro side, for example, theurgy attacks are a much better version of Showtime from P5R, giving you more control over choosing which one to use, how they charge up, and how they reflect the characters.  I still wish you could skip the cutscene... but still a significant improvement.  On the con side, Tartarus is really dull compared to Persona 5's palaces.  There's almost no environmental storytelling in Tartarus, no clues as to why one level looks different from another (and why one specific section, as all my party members EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGED, is physically painful to look at, so the devs knew what they were inflicting on me).  The only motive to explore it for much of the game is simply because the leader said so, and because you need to grind so you can face the monthly bosses.  I also really question the decision to add variety floors that actually make Tartarus more of a pain, such as the greedy shadows that steal all the loot and you have to guess which directions they run in to catch them, most of the time without any clues.  Later on they give you an SP costing skill that just skips that whole minigame, so I can't understand why they put that in there to begin with.  Finally, enemy variety is severely lacking compared to Persona 5.  Even the bosses you fight in Tartarus are just mixed up versions of regular enemies with no truly unique mechanics.  Thankfully combat is generally fun (and quick) and the loot flows nicely through Shuffletime, so Tartarus really isn't a terrible experience over all; it's just incredibly uninspired from a level and enemy-design standpoint.  It also gets very easy, even on hard mode, where I simply used melee focused characters, healed them with Yukari's ridiculously cheap healing, and never had to use SP items again past the midpoint of the game.  Again, it's reasonably fun because I genuinely like these characters, but I can't escape the feeling that it could be so much better.

Music

More hit or miss for me than Persona 5, but I do love jazz much more than rap (the dorm song started setting my teeth on edge after a while), so it's going to come down to personal taste for a lot of people.  A lot of the songs for running around school and town are great, though I do wonder why they didn't go harder on other aspects of the ambiance like the weather.  Rainy days would make so much sense in this game.

Side Stories

The social links are pretty hit or miss for me, like the music.  Some are great and thought-provoking, a couple are genuinely funny and made me laugh, but several of them seem pretty pointless or undermine themselves in the rank 10 conversation.*  Biggest disappointment for me with these links is that the main character is so undercharacterized it's not at all clear why talking to him is this amazing, life changing experience for all these people.  Even if you give people terrible, life-destroying advice, they discover themselves regardless and credit you as their dearest friend and savior.  Joker, in Persona 5, has much better dialogue options, IMO, and also helps turn people's lives around in concrete ways with his unique abilities.

Story

You'll hear a lot of people say this game has the best Persona story.  In fact, that seems to be a pretty overwhelming consensus on social media, from what I have seen.  It definitely is good, and much better than I have found in most video game franchises, but it's really strange to me that it's considered so clearly better than Persona 5 because there are some pretty obvious flaws.  Not fatal flaws, mind you; I still enjoyed it quite a bit, but I found Persona 5 a lot more compelling from start to finish, and I'm not even going to talk about the differences in pacing.

First off, people praise the characters in this game.  Regarding your companions, I think that's definitely deserved.  I like nearly every companion in this game better than their most similar equivalent in P5R.  They feel more down to earth, less trope-y, and they have better defined and consistent development that is interwoven well with the main story, with one exception.**

Regarding the villains (who are, after all, supposed to be characters too), this is definitely not deserved.  Without delving into spoilers in the main body here, I will just say there are a lot of inconsistencies in the motives and actions of the villains in this game.***  E.g., sometimes they use overwhelming force and sometimes they hold back for no clear reason.****  

The plot and worldbuilding also don't feel as developed as Persona 5, but I have heard some of my questions in this area will be answered with DLC.

* Maiko's story was really touching, and I felt for her, but asking to marry you just made the whole thing leave a sour taste in my mouth.  It would have felt much more natural if she said she was thankful for you because you're like the older brother she never had.  The epilogue scene for this social link is also bizarre, because the father opens his heart to you like you're a close friend then turns on a dime and starts screaming at you to stay away from his daughter.  I've known IRL bi-polar people who don't flip that fast.

** Aigis is weird and creepy as a concept, and as trope-y as it is possible for a character to be.  I will never get over the idea that a scientist for the Kirijo Group decided to make a ""weapon"" that looks like a 16-year-old girl.  The Chairman actively highlights this problem with how he introduces her, telling the group to look for a weapon so SEES starts looking for a tank or something.  And when we met her, I literally thought, ""Please don't tell me they're going to have the android learn what it means to be human by discovering emotions...""  It's the laziest version of that trope, too, like the difference between Avatar and District 9: both movies get you to sympathize with aliens, but one takes the easy road of making them attractive and perfect; the other makes them hideous and STILL gets you to sympathize, which takes much cleverer writing.  Aigis is obviously the former, not the latter.  She stands out all the worse against the other SEES members, who are actually interesting, flawed people.

*** The Chairman was a huge missed opportunity.  He could have had so many interesting connections to Yukari's and Mitsuru's fathers.  He could have given an alternative, more nihilistic philosophy compared to the main themes of the game.  But instead the sum of his motives is he believed a prophecy (no clue who gave this prophecy or how) that someone would become a king (over a bunch of dead people?) if Nyx came back.  For that he was willing to live a double life for years and crucify you all, murdering Mitsuru's father.  I mean, COME ON you've got to give me more than that.

**** Takaya has a revolver that he always gets perfect killshots with when he uses it, but he only uses it when the plot demands somebody die.  Supposedly he is desperate to stop us from ending the Dark Hour, but his strategy is to... shoot one of us at a time, with several months in between...  And when he fights you as a boss, for some reason he does it totally honorably without even trying the gun, even though that gun was unblockable by a couple of the most powerful persona users in this game.",1708801703,1708801703,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I just wanna say this is definitely the BEST P3 to play despite lacking the epilogue story which is The Answer in FES but it still has MORE content than FES if we exclude the epilogue story.

I heard a rumor that Atlus is in the process of making The Answer story as a DLC, hopefully that's true

a little tip if you wanna max every social link possible, make sure to prioritize every single social link inside the school first, the schedule in P3 is so tight compared to P5R and P4G trust me no matter how tempting it is to do social links outside of your school first don't do it

P3 is definitely my favorite it took me 70-80 hours to finish compared to P5R which took me 120ish to complete which is honestly I think P5R is just too long

another thing that I love about P3 is that the characters development is developed throughout the entire game instead of just ""done"" after their ark is over like in other persona game
but I do admit that the gameplay is a bit lacking compared to P5R and the dungeon design is obviously better in P5R but in terms of story and the character I personally love this one so much more than other persona games",1707130209,1708780993,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I will say they've definitely put in a ton of work to update this game and it plays very well. There are some nice new touches and things I'd like to see in future games too.

Stories within the Social links are all mostly the same in quality, but it is clear that some would hit harder to some people than other Social Links. Exactly how life is with socializing, you will meet people you might not click with, while you can find those who you instantly relate to with their stories as you spend time together.

While the questioning of the content that was taken away will always be discussed, I would personally like to say this is the best version of Persona 3 as a whole. Significantly more polished in its mechanics and tone, lack of a severe and sometimes blatantly unfair punishments from the original are gone. It made the experience much more enjoyable throughout the whole game. If they do add the Answers DLC or the Female MC story, it would only serve to enhance an already masterful product. And I will look forward to that day if it arrives.

Even though Persona 3 Reload is still bogged down by the missteps of early persona, the game is still a must-play for anyone with even a passing interest in jrpgs. These games just make you feel good, and even though this one is ten times more depressing than the other two put together, watching the credits roll is like saying goodbye to a close friend.

Even though I love P5 and the story of P4, I never got around to playing 3 as bearing witness to THE worst turn-based rpg gameplay I'd ever touched with 4 killed any and all desire to go even further back in the timeline to a game that was sure to be even more clunky, ugly, tedious and frustrating. When the remake was announced, it became the only game I have truly looked forward to since Elden Ring, and I'm extremely happy that my hopes paid off, even with a company as shitty as Atlas.

The gameplay of P3R runs counter to P4 in every way, in that the gameplay is some of the best turn-based combat I've ever played. It's so stylish, so flashy, so fun and satisfying, and it flows like an absolute dream. While tartarus is still an endless labyrinth of the same 3 rooms copied and pasted over and over and over for [spoiler] 264 [/spoiler] floors, and is still a tedious slog to get through as a result, I'm more than happy with keeping the game as faithful to the source material as possible for the longtime fans rather than the transient tourists. While some battles do still reek of that obnoxious early persona, eg. comical health pools, constant statuses and insta-kill attack spam, the vast majority are still fun and tactical. Anything is better than the sticky, clunky, ugly, stock sfx laden hell that is P4's combat. (Missing all your attacks for 4 rounds straight is fun, right?)

It should be outright criminal to have a game series with music THIS good. No words I have can do justice to the absolute euphoria that is this game's soundtrack, so I won't even try. There is not a single piece of music in this game that I hate from start to finish, every single one is just a transcendental banger. You know you have something special when you find yourself getting your groove on while just wandering around the overworld.

The story is probably the weakest of the 3 persona games though. While it isn't bad by any means, it is extremely clich√©d and doesn't really progress for about 75% of the game's runtime.

[spoiler] 

""Where monster!?"" 
""There monster!""
""Kill monster!"" 
""Wait for next monster..."" 
[/spoiler]

sums up a large majority of the game's runtime, and the game doesn't really do much with its interesting premise. On top of that, the party members themselves don't get as much time to shine as they should. In the other two games, each new member of your group is the focus of an entire arc of the story before joining up. In P3 though, they just kinda show up, wave, and then that's it, they're part of the party now. On top of that though, I was also baffled to discover that none of the male party members have social links. Apparently it's a holdover from the original game having a male and female protag, and there aren't enough tarot cards (or time) to add them all, but like, I can become best friends with a fat guy who nearly shits himself in front of me on multiple occasions but I can't get closer with the guys I'm risking my life alongside? So to compensate each of the guys have a sort of truncated, pseudo-social link system that just randomly pops up whenever it feels like. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing. (I guess). Be prepared though, as even though the overarching narrative isn't the best in the series, the game makes up for it by being much more emotionally charged than the other two. Every social link, every party member, every story beat is just downright depressing at times, and even though there's still plenty of that persona levity mixed in, this is a very dark game. Even though I had been spoiled on the ending and knew what was going to happen for 70 hours, I still wasn't ready when it finally arrived.


And to round things up, the game is drop dead gorgeous with stylized graphics and a buttery framerate. This is what the PS4 was keeping us from all this time, and I'm so glad these games have a home that doesn't chain them to 30 fps gameplay anymore. (Although am I the only one who thinks that the school looks... off? The place is so white and textureless that it looks like it was cobbled together out of spare assets.)

So to summarise: I love this game. It's everything I love about jrpgs, and I hope that Persona 6 can keep the flame going when it releases in 2035 after Persona 5: Dancing in Tactical Strikers 2's 3rd dlc.",1708694666,1708757278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I first played the Portable version on PSP and, even with a lot of downgrades of the original (and some QoL from Persona 4), it managed to affect me in a very emotional and thoughtful way of many different aspects of my life.
Because of it, I followed this franchise from that point on and played many other Persona and SMT games, most of them were indeed a great time/experience, but not a single one managed to hit me like 3 did.
But even with my personal bias and attachment to it, I will try to give at least an honest to good review about positive and negative aspects of this ""Remake"". Please take all of it with a grain of salt.
Pros:
-The models are amazing. They really did polish everyone, not only Soejima's Art style improved, but his anatomy as well. If you compare to Persona 5 models, the new ones are less uncanny than the previous game.
- The Soundtrack is top notch. Atsushi Kitajoh managed to create not only beautiful arranges from the originals made by Shoji Meguro, but  with the return of the legendary Lotus Juice on the rhymes, they managed to outclass Mass Destruction. It's going Down is perfect in a way that hits you with a dopamine rush when you hit shadow advantage and, if you time it correctly, hit an all out attack at the peak of the song. Color your night still gives you a ""Persona 5"" vibe, but you can still ""feel"" it belongs to Persona 3. The entire soundtrack likes to work on small leitmotifs here and there to make you feel attached to the atmosphere of the game, and when you hit the final part + the credits song you get a kind like ""nostalgia"" punch on your gut together with the really emotional ending.
- The Battle system is even more balanced and comfortable than the previous Persona games. The party members skills got buffed, the addition of Kouga and Eiga spells balanced the Light/Dark elements. The Navigator system AND Baton pass equivalents got balanced/nerfed to improve the all in all experience of the game, not to mention since you're fighting shadows, you can't have a spoiler of their weaknesses from the Velvet Room fusion/Recruiting them on ambush.
- Tartarus got a INCREDIBLE revamp. The original and portable versions made Tartarus only looks the same thing with different color schemes each Name Floors, but on Reload each one has it's own vibe/environment/random seeds to make the Immersion and experience way better
- The addition of Link episodes with party members and, even with some story relevant characters made the experience even better for newcomers and P3 Veterans. They even added some special situations that were exclusive for certain Versions of the game (one from P3FES and another from P3Portable FemMC route only)
- The addition of Theurgy Skills made the gameplay even more interesting, putting the Fusion Spells the protagonist had on Theurgies (and not requiring you to have the Personas on the party all times) not only balanced the use of it, but also made it even more interesting to complete the Compendium
- You can now choose to date a female Social Link or not. Compared to the original, you were obligated to
date the girls and even had the risk of getting a reverse arcana if you got caught cheating or ignored them for a long time
- Reverse Arcanas now are way harder to get, In my entire gameplay, I didn't get a single one, so I think the only way now is purposely choosing a rude/stupid option on the Social Link interactions, which brings me to the next topic
- Voiced Social Links improved the Visual Novel part of the game, making you feel more attached to them.
- Better HUD/Aesthetic design than the previous games.

Now with the Cons:
- The game feels way more easy than compared with the original and other Persona games, sure, it takes more time to ""break"" than Persona 5, but the few cases I got a game over were on two specific battles and against the Reaper because a friend on Discord kept insisting for me to beat it on level 35~50. Even with all the QoL and balance on some mechanics, Theurgies really help to mitigate or even brute force some bosses/challenge battles. 
- You can't change Tartarus Theme like the FES/Portable Version, which is a shame because after a while it gets really boring to hear the same arranged for more than 200 floors.
- The game does gives you more options, but you still have the same time limit from the previous games, so, unless you follow a guide or is a veteran, you can pretty much fail to get all Social Links on the first play through(Veteran's Advice: focus on the School Social Links since you can't do them on weeks before exams, exams and school vacation+near the ending)
- The Social Links are a hit or miss for the community. Either you hate them, or you love it. So I highly avoid discussing about that online.
- Some Link episodes are miss able and even unlocks some specific Personas to fuse, so if you don't make them or lose one, you're pretty much screwed.
- Not having the ""Answer"" and ""female MC"" route makes the fan base debate if this could really be the definitive edition of Persona 3, but they already confirmed on making a future DLC for The Answer Episode, so, only time will tell.
- Tartarus has few Designs for each Floor Section and some are either extremely short, or stupidly big with a big NOTHING on them, so after a few times, you just ignored them and just look to the HUD on the left side.
- The Artbook and OST DLC's are a scam. You cannot access them unless booting up the game SPECIFICALLY for each one, meanwhile Steam has a built in MP3 player for games with Soundtrack for years already. This is probably a terrible decision from Atlus/Sega to avoid people from pirating it or spreading on the internet.

I highly recommend this game for both Veterans and newcomers, and I can assure that this game was a test/base for the future Persona games (possibly 6 or another 4 Remaster)

Persona 3 Reload is a remake of probably one of my favorite RPGs of all time, and it nailed it spectacularly in my eyes. The story is mostly unchanged, with a new feature called Linked Episodes and all new character casting. The gameplay has been vastly revamped to function as a mix of P3 and P5 while Tartarus was reworked. The soundtrack has been redone by the team featuring a new vocalist and more Lotus Juice. The graphics and artstyle of the game is upgraded to a level near P5, featuring a mix of CG and animated cutscenes for important scenes. Reload didn't really reinvent the wheel for me, but it was more Persona 3 which I enjoyed. Some sections below will probably bleed into the other ones by how they're affected.

[h2]Story/Casting[/h2]
Persona 3's story being unchanged means it still has a very slow beginning and doesn't really pick up for the first few months. The Linked Episodes are days where party members/[spoiler]Ryoji[/spoiler] will ask you to hang out. These are absolutely fantastic, they add more exposition/character thoughts about their situations. They have story arcs, new CG art, and allow you to fuse a new Persona at the end. They bleed into gameplay however, since most of them take place during the already limited daytime. The character casting is wonderful in Reload, with the old cast voicing side characters and the new cast getting better throughout the story. Social Links are 100% voiced in Reload and it's amazing (referenced below).

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
[h3]Tartarus[/h3]
The gameplay of Persona 3 Reload is a mix of very different and very similar. Tartarus is still a whopping 264 floors and is still the majority of your playtime. But the blocks visually look and navigate differently (just wish they played different themes), with many new features sprinkled throughout. The Tired system has been removed. Monad passages on floors have a strong enemy inside and reward you with items and the map of the floor and the floor above. Block breakpoints contain boss gauntlet versions that are excellent one-time rewards. F.uuka is a much better navigator in Reload, being able to buff the party before fights, make you invisible/distress enemies, and fully map the floor. Some floors are ""Dark Zones"" where Twilight Fragments spawn in abundance (a new currency used for some treasure chests and the clock in Reload), but spawn the Reaper after around 1 minute. The Reaper doesn't show up until 62F, but once unlocked can spawn on any floor and even chases you up floors.

[h3]Battle System[/h3]
The battle system was reworked to be a mix of P3 and P5, with the 3 Physical skill/6 elements system. Less enemies have instakills at a lower level, and Kouha/Eiha (Light/Dark non instakill) type skills were added to Personas and Shadows. Like Portable you have direct party control, and the original Tactics system just isn't very good in Reload (doesn't make use of Shift or have original options). Shift is a new feature similar to P5's Baton Pass where hitting a 1 More lets you swap turns to another character. (doesn't buff you inherently, requiring Shift Boost/Amp) Missing/blocking/repelling an enemy with an attack no longer invalidates your extra turn/downs you. Party members have different skill lists from the original games and some perform much better and some kind of diminished at first. (but everyone has a good list by lategame) At nighttime in the dorm characters will have voiced hangouts, and doing enough of 1 type grants them a Characteristic which passively buffs a part of their kit. All party members have extremely powerful abilities called Theurgies which charge up passively depending on their personality (think Limit Breaks in FF!), The protagonist's Theurgies are the Fusion Spells from the original games but they only need the Personas in their Compendium.

[h3]Fusion/Shuffle Time[/h3]
The Fusion system is heavily upgraded and works like Soul Hackers 2/SMTV, with a Fusion Search option that shows you a complete list of what combinations make what from the Personas you have. Filling out the Compendium grants the protagonist a very strong Characteristic so it feels rewarding. Skill Cards are dupable daily at the Shrine, making it extremely easy to build something powerful. Shuffle Time is no longer a minigame and you can just pick your reward/s with no consequence of cursed cards. Major Arcanas are a new card type that serve various effects, and once you hit Arcana Burst (cap) it buffs all rewards for the rest of the expedition. Finishing an enemy with an All-Out-Attack or Theurgy greatly increases the Shuffle Time chance.

[h3]Difficulty[/h3]
Now with all these changes you're probably wondering if the game is still hard. Yes at early game where resources are scarce, but it's very easy to overlevel just casually playing since floor subbosses give a lot more XP now. Rare Shadows don't run away near instantly and grant a boatload of XP in Shuffle Time. Easily dupable Skill Cards from Shuffle Time and Compendium prices allow great access to builds. Full moon bosses have new/reworked mechanics and are still pretty interesting. Merciless isn't weird like P5 and actually makes the game harder. Basically having direct control+Shift turns the game on its head, where you can bring the same group of party members for every encounter and shift back to protag as needed.

[h3]Social Sim[/h3]
The social sim aspects of the game are mostly the same with some nice additions. Linked Episodes, nighttime voiced hangouts, exploring the strip mall at night, and using the dorm computer. The Episodes, hangouts, and fully voiced Social Links are my favorites! You feel a lot more connected with the characters having it all voiced and it's an absolute treat from start to finish. Time is limited and with only 2 Social Links occuring at night, you spend the daytime progressing Links/Episodes and night time progressing Social Stats. School answers are changed, and sleeping in class gives Courage. Romances are no longer forced at rank 8 like the original, and social link reversals are even rarer.

[h2]Soundtrack[/h2]
The soundtrack has been redone by the team with a new vocalist in tow. I'm partial to this change, I believed several songs from the original were done worse in Reload namely Mass Destruction, Master of Tartarus, and the final month themes. When the new vocalist does get to shine in the new songs though she is absolutely wonderful! I didn't let these bring the game down too much for me, but I do wish we had a toggle option like many other remasters/remakes allow for soundtrack. Additionally the soundtrack included with the deluxe edition is truly awful (I left a review there) but yeah.

[h2]Graphics/Artstyle[/h2]
Persona 3 had a clean artstyle for the time, and Reload raised it up to P5's quality. Some areas of the game especially Iwatodai Dorm look too bright however, but I believe you can color correct it to look like the original. I have a very weak rig and yet I could play on the highest settings with no frame dropping (probably because this game still runs on xbox 1/ps4) so performance is good as usual for Atlus games. Most of the major scenes were done in CG instead of anime, but certain scenes not animated before were animated in Reload. Going into Reload at first I did not think this was a grand idea. (coming off Portable's PC launch and expecting FES/movie scenes) I was pleasantly surprised by how everything looked and having a closer view on the scene really adds to it. 

[h2]Fin[/h2]
Persona 3 Reload is a remake that does Persona 3 justice. It doesn't completely morph the game into something unrecognizable, it just adds more Persona 3 throughout and makes it look neat and proper for modern-day. Despite small gripes about certain decisions by Atlus (like this game being $70) I fully believe it was worth the price. If I had to give it a number rating, I would put it around 9/10.

The graphics and UI are gorgeous, the cast is very interesting and varied, the gameplay is addictive, the soundtrack is full of bangers and earworms, and the story was engaging and had plenty of wonderful takeaways and heavy-hitting emotional moments. The story in particular is a very high note, and surprisingly mature in spite of the high school anime aesthetic.

P3 Reload goes above and beyond what is expected of remasters, making for a lot of wonderful new systems and options and soulful revisions to improve quality of life and overall game experience. $70 for a remake had me leery at first, but it's genuinely worth every dollar. There isn't a single area that I can truly naysay this game in, and the most I could offer in terms of ideas for improvement is to have settings for xp and money rate adjustments to alleviate some of the grind that I did to hit some optional milestones at certain points.

All in all, I have never had a game that aced every single area there is to judge before.

The turn-base system isn't something I typically enjoy, but this whole series is the exception for me. It's fun and really thought-provoking at times. I enjoyed the flair that the combat had, a slick type of design compared to P5R. The social link system is also really fun, learning about a bunch of new characters and having it connect to the combat of the game is really smart. The story is where the game shines tho. The characters are really well-developed and have some sort of underlying theme with them. The plot is also good with a bunch of plot twists and reveals. The message of death being unavoidable and learning how to live your life with the time you have is done so well here. The ending is perfect ;(. Music all bang, I honestly think there is not a song here that isn't good. Full Moon Full Life, Memories of You, Mass Destruction, It's Going Down Now are all highlights in the game. Voice acting too is actually perfect, only cast member I thought was a bit below everyone was Yukari but that was for some scenes. My only complaint is that there isn't much to do at night.

It is undeniably a good experience and a good entry point to the Persona series just like Persona 5 before it. Although, being a huge fan of the original, it's my personal opinion that there are some real flaws with this remake.

Most of the unique features from the original Persona 3 have been discarded in favor of the more modern iteration of the Persona gameplay such as the removal of the protagonist being able to wield every kind of weapon, which added immensely to the customization and strategy of the game. They also brought back direct party control which is a nice feature just like it was back in Persona 3 Portable, however, just like in that game, the AI control has been pushed to the side and is unable to actually be properly viable in any situation. The AI control was a key component to the original vision of the game, not something to be fixed. It was deliberate and it, along with many other things, truly added to the idea that these people in your party are people entirely seperate from you who live their own lives as well as to the difficulty of the game, needing to plan way ahead and thinking things through a lot more than with direct control. I do recognize though that not a lot of people actually enjoyed how Persona 3 went about its gameplay so I can excuse direct control being at the forefront of it. However, what I can't turn away from is the presentation.

The game itself is beautiful and almost every area is wonderfully recreated and given new life but most of the original gloom is gone. The game is far too bright in some places and it HEAVILY leans into the green color scheme present during the dark hour which would be fine if not being used in places where the original clearly was going for an entirely different atmosphere. The atmosphere in the final boss is effectively ruined, where the original had dark clouds surrounding the arena and everything was very gloomy and dark along with a slight unsaturated green tint, the remake splatters bright green all over the place with it looking no different than any other place in the dark hour. Another aspect to the worse presentation are the cutscenes. The animations are beautiful no matter if it's in engine or animated but they are all worse. The direction in all of them is very weak and nowhere near what the original had, such as the first time the protagonist summons his persona which takes away most of the tension and ""coolness"" of the original. The game also goes for a more watered down normal anime look to the 2D cutscenes which is not a bad thing but it does fit way less and is not as unique as the original style of the cutscenes. This change in art style is also seen with the sprites for the characters when they are talking and these are more important than they may seem thanks to them being present the entire game. The original Persona 3 had incredibly expressive and unique looking game sprites, every character having a wide range of emotions as well as poses. The remake completely throws that away for incredibly basic sprites that virtually all look the same minus a simple smile or frown and the position of the head for some cases. It's mind boggling to me how some sprites simply weren't even remade and the times they were used in the original, others are used in the place of them that simply do not fit at all. I don't understand this change whatsoever if not to keep it more in line with the ones in Persona 5 but even then there are some sprites in that game that are far more expressive. The art style of the sprites themselves is completely fine, I have no issues with them whatsoever even if they are less unique and I completely understand the change when it comes to that. 

In terms of story it is pretty much the same with some new added things here and there. These additions are by far my favorite, such as the new interactions with Strega and the events that pop up sometimes with characters that do not have social links. These are amazing and give glimpses into these characters you wouldn't get otherwise unless you played as FEMC in P3P and even then, as far as I could tell, all the events are entirely new. These should be kept going forward for characters that don't have any social links in the future Persona games. The ending of the game is also amazing, it is given justice and it has aspects from different adaptations of the game from what I could tell. Truly, in terms of story I have nothing to complain about.

The english voice acting, the one I played with, is not bad at all. I think every voice actor does a phenomenal job though some characters could have been closer to the originals because as it is you have some who sound exactly or near the same and some who sound completely different. Beyond that I think it's just as good as the original and the new voice acting in social links especially adds to that.

The music is, in my opinion, amazing. I love every track without exceptions after having heard them all for quite a while. Yes, some are weaker than the originals but I don't think there's any song that is outright terrible or anything of the sort. It would have been great to have the option to play the originals instead which I still prefer over the new ones but no, you're stuck with them. I am fine with that especially given that the battle them is far better to me. It's Going Down Now is my favorite battle theme in Persona hands down even though mass destruction fits a lot more and is a way more iconic.

Circling back to the battle gameplay, it also has some flaws of its own. Firstly, the addition of shifting is actually pretty nifty but the AI cannot use it which makes no sense because the ones in 5 could. This adds even less reason to use the AI tactics and makes that feature dead on arrival. Then there's theurgy which is just not fun whatsoever with the exception of the ones that raise your attack or orgia mode but you could already do that without the need for an entire new mechanic. Theurgy attacks make the game too easy and they require barely any planning whatsoever for an incredible amount of damage and sometimes even more so if you strike the enemy's weakness with them. The idea to make the fusion skills theurgies is pretty cool and sure, so is giving every party member a special attack, but it is pretty much just broken from my experience. I have killed bosses simply by maxing out my theurgy skills prior and then using all of them, which yes was entirely my choice but the fact that it even is one is kind of stupid to me. Beyond this though, I like the other additions made to the gameplay such as the new Tartarus which is beautiful, the new major arcana cards and the monad doors scattered around which offer quite a bit of a challenge (given you don't just spam theurgies).

Do not let all this deter you from getting the game though! Like I said at the start, it is undeniably a great game! Most of my criticism revolves around me having played the original and prefering how it was handled far more as well as simply the fact that many of these new features and changes go against what the original creators had in mind for the game which really only annoys those who wanted a pure 100% true to form remake which was never going to happen so I am happy with what we got. All and all I recommend this game even if you're new to Persona.",1706969764,1708699407,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall this game is a 5/10. A major positive is OST, the original game has always been known for its phenomenal soundtrack and this is no exception. However since this is in all seriousness the only real positive for this game then you should just really listen to it separately. 

Now onto the negatives:
The first negative is Tartarus, which has to be the most boring dungeon out of any rpg I have played. There is nothing of note that happens during this part of the game and is exclusively used for grinding. Also the music for every area in Tartarus is extremely repetitive and makes drudging through every floor a slog. If this dungeon was entirely optional then it would not be so bad but it is required to beat the game and you will have to run through all 264 floors for the ending. It also makes personal progression not really mean anything since it feels endless. 

The second negative aspect of this game is the story or the lack of a story. Nothing happens until the last 3 months of the game as there is not really any interesting plot thread to keep you invested until then. The main villains of the game do not have a clear motivation for what they are doing as they flip on dime. Interactions with them are sparse and the main characters do not have any reason to really fight them except one specific scene on the date 10/4 (Spoilers obviously). Speaking of characters all of them are stereotypes or plot devices and have little screen time with each other. The best example of this is Ken, he just shows up in the story, is only plot relevant for a month, and then just ceases to exist in the any type of scene relevant to the main story. The inverse of this is Misturu, her entire character is exposition. She willingly withholds important details from the party or just forgets to tell you (Again, this pertains to the scene during 10/4). Junpei is your basic best friend that chases after women and has character arc during the game that doesn't really mean anything due to a one note character being at the center of his development. It would be so much better if we knew anything about this character that Junpei interacts with but the game just doesn't elaborate on anything. Aigis shoves the message of Memento Mori into every single discussion involving her that it becomes bland. Fuuka doesn't really do anything besides exist. While Yukari has least trauma out of every character in the game except for Akihiko. Koromaru is the best party in the game just because he is a dog (I know this isn't actually criticism, I am just biased). Alongside nothing actually happening in the plot it only describes events that happened in the past. You do not actually progress through the plot itself as most the interesting things have already happened and you are an observer until the final 3 months of the game.

I don't really recommend this game to anybody unless you really need to know what happens in it. I believe the best thing you can do to experience what little plot there is is to just watch a lets play on youtube.",1708672183,1708672183,False,1,1,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

The original Persona 3 is by far my favorite of the modern Persona games, so I was really looking forward to this version of the game. It does unfortunately feel like a very sanded-down/sanitized experience compared to the original. The combat is so much easier that it's just kinda boring at times, and I don't particularly like the inclusion of elements from Persona 5 Royal (I wasn't a fan of baton pass or 'showtime' attacks in that game either tbf). The eerie, brooding atmosphere of the original is entirely absent. The new rendition of the soundtrack doesn't feel like it accurately captures the tone of the original game. I do like the new tracks in this though. The general art direction is much weaker overall, though I do like the new menus a lot. With all of that being said, I still like P3 Reload quite a bit. I don't see this game as a clear improvement, but Reload is a nice supplement to the original game. I'd recommend playing Reload as its own experience, but I think Persona 3 FES is just as great and absolutely still worth playing.

I do appreciate that there's much more voice acting now, and that there's the option to switch between English and Japanese voices. I'm a big fan of the original PS2 English dub, but I've been really enjoying experiencing the game with the Japanese voices this time around. The new hangout mechanic is also a great addition. This certainly isn't the worst way to play Persona 3 if you've never played it before or if you're looking to revisit it, but I'd strongly recommend playing the original FES as well. Persona 3 is one of the best role-playing games ever made, so you'll have a great time regardless of whatever version you choose to play.",1706929868,1708660844,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It‚Äôs actually shocking how faithful they were able to keep it to the original while making it still feel like a fresh experience. Like they really didn‚Äôt add any new businesses or locations but the way they repurposed the old places to work with modern Persona mechanics like gardening or working part time was pretty seamless. Because of this, the game is way less daunting than something like Persona 4 Golden and especially Persona 5 Royal for newcomers. At the same time, I didn‚Äôt ever get the same issue I had in P3 FES where I had long stretches of time where I had absolutely nothing to do in my night time slot and it started to get monotonous. The game strikes a very good balance between not having enough to do and not having so much to do that it‚Äôs overwhelming.

I feel basically the same way about the story as I did in the original. It starts off a little meh and the pacing can be a bit awkward with how long you have to wait for major events which don‚Äôt always feel like they were all that meaningful, but once it gets going, it‚Äôs genuinely a very gripping story. It helps that more effort is put into expanding on characters like Shinji and Ken who I previously didn‚Äôt feel much for because of how little they got to do in the original game (note that I haven‚Äôt played portable so I can‚Äôt comment on the FEMC route in that game).

I do have a few gripes though. One, the game leans a little bit too much on the easy side for my liking. I‚Äôm no expert at Persona games but even I was having no issue zooming through Tartarus in single time slots. The game simply gives the player too many options to destroy everything in their path. Theurgy is absolutely busted. If it were up to me, I probably would have limited it far more. Maybe one Theurgy use per battle so that you have to be more strategic about when to use it and who to use it on. Sylphid Aura also made it so that if I ever felt unprepared for a battle, I could use a negligible amount of SP from Fuuka to instantly have a massive advantage. 

Admittedly, I was playing on Hard mode and not Merciless, but that brings me to my next criticism. New Game plus was absolutely ruined in this game. I wanted to try Merciless out to see if it would up the challenge enough, but for some god forsaken reason, they made it so that if you start NG+ with merciless, you only carry over cosmetic items. This means you no longer have all the social stats you spent the first playthrough building up which makes it way harder to max out all social links (which is pretty much the only reason I play NG+ in persona games). So I decided to bite the bullet and just play hard again. But for some reason they made player level carry over on any difficulty setting aside from Merciless which completely unbalances the game and removes any challenge entirely. And yes, I know that previous games‚Äô NG+ gave you access to the compendium you‚Äôd built up on your first playthrough which made any challenge completely non existent, the difference is that you had a choice whether or not to use the busted personas way earlier on. You don‚Äôt have a choice what level your character is at so you have no choice but to make it ridiculously easy or reset all of your progress from the first playthrough. As someone who used NG+ to try out harder difficulties once I got used to the game while simultaneously using them to max out everything, this is really disappointing and there‚Äôs absolutely no reason they had to do it this way. I can only hope they fix this in an update but I‚Äôm not crossing my fingers.

Over all, this was an amazing remake and the complaints I had were pretty minor at the end of the day. It‚Äôs a great game to get someone into the Persona franchise and returning Persona fans will love it too.",1708649868,1708650606,True,1,0,0.511111080646514893,0,True,False,False

-Visual: Art direction of the original game is gone. 3d model take getting use to. 

-Music: New tracks are amazing and very memorable. Old tracks are very bad. In gameplay instrumental track are not noticeable, but vocal tracks catch your ear straight away. The changed vocal actress to Azumi Takahashi and producer to Atsushi Kitajoh. They can't give the same feeling of the old tracks and when compared to old ones they are straight downgrade

-Graphics: New P5 style graphics are good. Menus are stylish, but personally don't like overstilization of P5. Lighting in some areas are horrendous and flat, like in dorms. 

-Gameplay: Shift, Theurgy and combat menu's are amazing. But making MC's fusion spells and Aigis Orgia Mode theurgy is a stupid decision. Out of 18 fusion spells they ""imported"" only 7. Game is much easier even on merciless. Fuuka was remade and its decent Navigator now. She has okay spells that can be used outside of the combat. Her Oracle now only give you good things and don't affect enemies, personally don't like this change. For some reason, the removed talking with teammates and instead apt for P5 style of dungeon conversations.

-Tartarus: They changed it a lot. Each block is distinct and with different layout. Visually only first 2-3 blocks are decent, after they overcomplicate them. New catch up companion lvls are good addition. Arcanas are good and make grind less tedious. Monad doors are fine.

-Social Links: They are still strict, but game gives you new methods of gaining points. Now you can friendzone female SL and don't get others SL reversed, what a innovation. Male S.E.E.S members, Ryoji and Takaya got link episodes. Basically SL, but always progresses and available after story moments.

-Voice Acting: New voices are good and I don't have complain for them. Except for Koromaru. Its a guy making dog noises. Its fucking bad. Now every SL rank is voiced.

-Price and DLC: Those fuckers again cut content from the game and sell it as DLC. Price of 70 dollar is too much for this game

-Modernization: Game become much safer, as safe game about suicide and death can be. Violence scenes been change to be black screens or camera angle change.

I feel Atlus did an amazing job but I kinda wish they did more with it since it is a remake. The QoL implementation is great but unfortunately was lacking on some parts. 

Namely the persona fusing; having to buy personas from the compendium to see what they could be fused was a problem that was fixed in Soul Hackers 2, but not in this game? Genuinely confuses me on why they didn't carry over SH2 fusing. 

The addition of the great clock boosting two party members to your main character level is okay for what we got but why was it even a thing in the first place. We have shared EXP in Persona 5 Royal (a game that came out 4 years ago) that would've just been a better fix. But instead of levelling up your whole party, its only two. You can't skip Theurgies like you could with P5R Showdown and the auto-rush mode is not at all fast. I also played on Merciless difficulty and it is by far the most easiest game so far. 

The new additions to the Tartarus dungeon being Monad doors, are a genuine disappointment when it could've been something interesting to spice up the mundane dungeon crawl of Tartarus. I understand if the intent is to keep the authentic and original experience intact, which is why they didn't change the procedural generated floors but it is incredibly outdated now. I would've prefer a much more grander and unique dungeon for each block of Tartarus.

The lighting and some of the environments outside of Tartarus, aesthetically looks like something you see in the PS2 days, just with better texture. It's feels uninspired and dull but you can remedy the situation by changing the brightness settings by 3-4 notches down. The default settings really do not do the game justice in terms of tone and atmosphere, something that Persona 3 has over any of the other persona games. As for the music, I thought I was going to hate the newly ""remastered"" tracks but everything except Mass Destruction eventually grew on me but I guess you have the DLC for that (or your own music player)

Even if the review is mostly viewed as negative, it still is the same Persona 3 game that I grew up and known to love. The story is told the same and still has a deep cut on my adolescent years and even so to this day. And the new Linked Episodes is by far the best addition they ever added to the game. More content and screen time with all the characters that you know and love and it doesn't have anything to do with their Social Links. This is something that I want more of for the next game and more to come. As a long-time fan, the biggest positive that I can give to this particular game's version of P3 is the Linked Episode and the fully voiced Social Links event. Both JP and EN dub killed it, but if I had to choose, I would pick JP as it was a lot more closer to what I had imagine the NPCs sounding like. 

If you had played the original and still deciding if it is worth it, or even a new-comer. I suggest you start of with this. It's still a masterpiece back during 2006 and it still is in current year. I love Persona 3 to death, so the complaints that I have is something more akin to my precious child that I want it to do well.",1708618320,1708618320,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I haven't reached summer yet, which is when I hear the story picks up, but I figured I can put some simple thoughts here for now.

Pros: 
1. The game is absolutely gorgeous. The UI, water theming, all out attack kill screens, and more are just pure artistry. They even arguably surpass P5's equally insane UI. 

2. To nobody's surprise, the music is fucking amazing. So many songs just go WAY harder than they have to, but I appreciate it for doing so. The only bad thing they did was mess up Mass Destruction, which is the non ambush battle theme. 

3. The 3D models and animation are mindblowingly good, especially compared to P5R. The models all look really good, and all the in battle animations look incredibly fluid. Hitting an enemy's weak spot is one of my favorite looking things in any game ever (you just have to see it).

Cons:

1. Unlike P5R, social links don't give any unique abilities at certain ranks. They now serve only the purpose of increasing Persona exp gain when fusing with the same arcana. This alone in my opinion is a slight turn off in comparison to P5R, unless you enjoy the social links more than the dungeons. My personal complaint with it is that it makes hanging out feel pointless in the context of furthering the dungeon progress, instead wanting to do social stat raising tasks. Again, if you enjoy the actual social links over their respective abilities, then you will probably love this just as much. 

2. Tartarus. Tartarus is basically mementos but arguably a little worse. It has very little sense of progression, and every floor you go up just feels the same as the last. Instead of it feeling like you're actually getting any further, unlike in P5R, where you at least get a mementos map that shows you your rough progress. It also doesn't benefit from one of the features that mementos best benefited from, which is that it exists SEPERATELY from the main story dungeons (for the most part). As a result, the personalized ""Palaces"", which are one of P5's strongest suites, are completely absent. Of course, this too, is a matter of personal preference. 

TLDR; So far, it feels like the game looks really pretty, with some banger tunes, yet it suffers from some annoying gameplay mechanics.",1708617531,1708617531,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

Some may say that the game is lacking elements of the previous version (Persona 3 Portable) and thus not be as happy with it, but honestly, for those looking for the authentic experience of Persona 3, you can't do any better than this. I had played the FES version before this, and a small bit of the Portable version, and I can say this is more like FES with a whole slew of improvements from Portable, as well as new Persona games, mixed in. 

With modern mechanics such as Skill Cards, Skill Acquisition choice when fusing, and of course the ability to control your entire party, the game feels more like Persona 3 if it were made today while keeping the plot and character development largely untouched (Only really changing mostly distasteful dialogue). The cutscenes are a major step up as well, even if a part of me does miss the old FMV style for certain scenes. The voice acting is, in my opinion, the biggest improvement the game made. Very rarely do I feel like a character has a weird delivery of a line, or a lack of understanding of the emotional weight of a scene. 

My playthrough took me about 80 hours. This was with me fastforwarding certain points simply due to knowing the general gist of the scene and wanting to hurry along to the next part (Skipping things like gossip or social stat upgrades). I didn't even complete every social link (I missed finishing 2), so if I had spent a bit more time, I probably could have gotten more done and played longer. Even so, less than 1 dollar per hour, to me, is well worth the price point if you like narrative JRPGs with dungeon crawling elements. 

Overall, I recommend Persona 3 to anyone willing to take the time to sit and play and experience the game. It's a lot of fun, and if you are like me, it'll leave you wanting even more. 9/10",1708613771,1708613771,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It just needed an overhaul with quality of life adjustments and this game did it pretty well. I do have a lot of issues still. Merciless should be Merciless for a reason and yet I was able to beat the entire game Solo using only Orpheus with no Grinding. If that is doable especially blind then Merciless is not hard enough. The main issue I have with the combat is the AI are not intelligent, occasionally there is a boss once or twice the entire game that acts differently but 99% of them just follow a pattern which makes them extremely easy to exploit and trivialises encounters where I clearly should have been outmatched. I dont understand why they did this as FES never had this problem and neither did Royal mostly. Another issue is locking certain fights hp bars by phases. If I can hit for 800 damage I expect the attack to do 800 damage, not do 70 and halt at the phase transition. Overall though the combat feels pretty smooth and satisfying to play like Royal but kept the core out what P3 was about.

Tartarus was great to explore, except Yabbashah which was confusing to navigate but that's more of a personal issue than a problem with the game itself. Like OG it still had that sense of an eternal climb to the top but managed to make arguably some of the worst looking areas from the original like Arqa into something very good.

The new VAs absolutely killed their roles, even Akihiko who's voice was very different still accurately portrayed his character well they all did an amazing job. The songs were amazing and its hard to pick between which is better, OG or Reload but Megaten games rarely miss when it comes to soundtracks so that's a given.

The story even after having played FES and Portable so many times was amazing and the additional scenes, dialogue and overall revamp of everything kept the game fresh and still got me to tear up. The cast feel like a proper group of actual friends and conversation flows nicely for the most part. P5 always had characters jumping in to say something that someone had just said and it drew out the game and got irritating after a while when Atlus way of trying to keep a character involved was to just make them spout out a random line of dialogue.

Even with all my issues with the game it is undoubtedly going to be my favourite game of 2024, nothing will come close to it. If you have the money to spare since it is pretty pricey definitely consider buying this. It's an amazing, accessible entry to the Persona series. 10/10",1708608979,1708608979,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

i first played p3fes back in summer 2019, and i was pretty ambivalent about it. for every thing i loved, there was some nitpick or strange design decision that held it back in some way. i ultimately came out of it thinking ""the story was amazing, but the gameplay was such a slog"". kinda the opposite of persona 5 to me where the story is just decent but the gameplay is fun.

welp, now that this remake exists, pretty much everything has been improved, and i can definitely say that this has all i want in a persona game. great story, gameplay is actually fun now, and the presentation is top notch.

my only real issues are the game balance (i played on hard mode, but it was still way too easy at points. theurgies are busted and should have been heavily nerfed), and the quirks from the original that passed down (some social links aren't good, some aspects of the story aren't amazing, strega is still kinda cringe).

characters were rewritten to be more accurate to the original japanese script, but i feel like that made some characters lose some of their spark. i.e. yukari is nicer, akihiko is less geeky and more obsessive with training (probably a result of them sticking to their flanderization), etc. i gotta say tho, i came out liking some characters a lot more in this version like koromaru, ken, and even takaya somehow. my lads junpei and aigis still peak tho !!

ultimately, based game. recency bias is probably at play here, but this is probably the best persona game and one of the best SMT games.

[h1] solid 100/10 -  PEAK FICTION. [/h1] -  this instantly became my #1 favourite game. 
a very thought provoking game, made me shred tears multiple times

music is a banger as always. UI is breathtakingly beautiful.

[u] [b]Symbolism and Plot  [/b][/u] Persona 3 handled heavy themes of mortality, loss, and the search for meaning in life extremely well. Everything ties back to the main message of the game perfectly. From the way that the characters summon their persona to character development (all of the SEES members had lost their close ones to death) to emphasize the message of the game. 

[u] [b]Color Theory: [/b][/u] The use of color to symbolize different themes and elements adds another layer of depth to the storytelling, providing visual cues that complement the narrative. Blue- mortality (makoto) , Red- past sin (SEES arm band, the glow of shadows) The gradual fading of color toward the end of the game representing the end. 

[u] [b]Character Development [/b][/u] The characters in the game undergo significant development, and their backgrounds are well fleshed-out compared to P5. I got so attached to most of the social link characters. All of them confronts their personal struggles and traumas to show that everyone is struggling, even a kid. This further highlights the message of the game, which is to overcome the fear of death/loss and find meaning in life.

I kept telling myself this, but I cannot. Besides, Red Dead Redemption 2, the Persona series has brought me not only memories, but tears of joys as well. I first played P4G on PS5, even though I did not get all achievements, but I managed to almost finish the game twice, then I proceeded to play P5R on PS5 as well, and I got all of the achievements, which I am really proud of. Even though I love P5R gameplay and its plot was indeed creative and interesting, the one that really stucks in my mind is P4G's plot.

That's why I had high hope for P3R when it was announced, and I heard it is one of the best story in the series. And I have to admit, it delivered spectacularly. I even managed to get all achievement within 1st playthrough, but I still have not been able to defeat Elizabeth though. While I love the way they setup the final boss of P4G, this apocalypse setup for final battle, the theme, the plot, and the message, all of them are truly remarkable.

If you are a fan of JRPG, especially Persona 4 (Golden) and, especially, Persona 5 (Royal) for its gameplay, you are in for a treat!! It has Persona 3's plotline with P5R's new and optimized gameplay.",1708512568,1708512568,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So persona 3 is the last game I decided to play in the trilogy because after I finished persona 4 the remake for 3 got announced. This means that hey I don't have to play persona 3 in a remaster, but at the same time, I was afraid that I'll end up losing interest in the game. So for 8 whole months, I had to patiently wait for the game to come out, and on the night of its release, I instantly played it, and holy shit I was instantly captivated by it. Tbh the past few games I've played hadn't been able to have a grasp on me like how Persona 5 and Omori did, but in the first few hours of Persona 3 Reload I knew then and there that this was going to keep me occupied for most of February. Ngl I kind of expected this game to take up all of Febuary but it turns out I no lifed the game even more than I expected. Although there were some days when I wasn't able to play it, the thought of playing the game never left my mind (yes I do sound insane).   


Alright, that's enough yapping time to actually talk about the game. So the graphics were a huge upgrade from both Persona 3 (duh) and Persona 5. Although some of the outside areas, aka when you're on top of the school's roof, looked a bit choppy, but who cares? The new models were absolutely beautiful and I hope they keep this style or improve on it in Persona 6 when it finally comes out in the year 3014 after we get 500 more spin-offs jk. The music was an absolute bop and tbh it's better and more consistent than Persona 4 music, hey who knows maybe one day Atlus will release Persona 4 Goldener and the music will absolutely blow me away, but only time will tell. When it comes to the story Persona 3 is hands down the best in terms of story, which makes me really want to play the 3rd semester, but we'll have to wait for that DLC to come out, which who knows how long that'll take. There were way too many scenes that made me cry and feel depressed, and way too many scenes that gave me hope and happiness. The confidant's storys were really heartwarming, especially the hanged man arcana. Also of course when it comes to Persona games, I don't really care too much for the combat, I mainly care about being able to hang out with the buds and god did the game delivered in that aspect, the fact that all of the characters had little hangout events made the game 10x more enjoyable compared to Persona 5, like bro it's so wholesome to watch Amada learn how to make coffee, and it's even more wholesome brushing Korumaru's fur. Just those little moments, really makes the game perfect and I hope they'll add this in Persona 6. Also even though I said that I didn't care too much for the combat, Persona 3 Reload is the first game where I took the combat and its mechanics seriously, I had a blast creating the most op Johanna that ever existed and one punching all of my enemies and bosses, and then learning how satisfying it is to create a persona out of several other personas.   


Tbh when it comes to criticism, it's really hard to find any. I guess I'm kind of disappointed that they didn't add the 3rd semester to the Reload, like I know that not everyone is a fan of it, but still, I NEED MORE CONTENT PLSSSSSSS!!! When it comes to persona games my number one gripe is that the games always feel too short, even though the game isn't short, but I want more content >:(  Also, this just crossed my mind, but I guess another gripe I have for the game is that it felt too easy, like even though I was using a dlc persona, I was having an easy time beating all of the bosses wayyy before I got Johanna, maybe it's just me getting overall better at jrpgs, but I swear that Persona 5 Royal's end game felt hard, and Persona 4 Golden just felt hard in general. Who knows, maybe I just grew a brain after playing several other Jrpgs after Persona 5 and Persona 4.   


Welp that's all I have to say about this game, this game was a roller coaster of emotions and I would heavily recommend that everyone on this planet to go and play this game.

In some ways it's improved, but in SO MANY WAYS this game has lost its way, not even including the ESG propaganda that has found its way into the game. I will start with what I like.

I like that there is more to do. Playing the original game if you did everything perfectly, not likely in your first play through,  then you had a lot of days where you just went to bed. A lot has been added to fill in your time, and it's for the most part well done. I would like even more of this. Also a lot of things now adds to your social skills so you have far less grinding and progress more naturally in your traits. I like the additions of the monad doors, and the final secret boss fight. I like the improved graphics and more voice acted lines.

Now for what I dislike. THE INTRO far starters. My GOODNESS anyone and everyone start a new game for the original P3 and watch it. THAT intro was epic, this one is sterile. It has NO FEELING AT ALL. In the original Yukari doesn't say a word, and yet you are in suspense. The music adds to the whole vibe of the situation and tension builds. Then you meet her later and that intro matters. You don't know what she was doing, you don't know what she was going through and when you get to the roof it has a greater impact. This goes for the ENTIRE story as a whole. 

In the original Persona 3 game every vibe of the game is filled with depression, pending doom, darkness. You feel tension building until it reaches a crescendo at the end of the game. THIS GAME it plays the same story, but it's in monotone. You do not vibe with P3R. The story may be ""good"" but it is portrayed poorly. So original game had this line in the beginning that was changed, I can only imagine to stroke someone's ego. It went like this 

""Time never waits. It delivers all equally to the same end. You,who wish to safeguard the future, however limited it may be... you will be given one year; go forth without falter, with your heart as your guide..."" Why change this? It seems for the sole purpose to take the line ""time waits for no man"" and change it to ""time waits for no one."" Don't be flippin pretentious. The original writing was fine. 

Now next up how they changed tartarus. I like to play solo, and exploring each floor in any persona game is just a pain. What does this mean? Well in the original p3 your party was useful. When you want to solo you send them to search the floor and fight on their own. Getting them to be stronger paid off, and when they or you couldn't handle a battle you had more empathy for them because they were actually being useful and could get hurt. The exhaustion system comes into play here too it also made you want to take care of your team and you had to make the most of each visit to tartarus.

ON THE SUBJECT OF TARTARUS! THE ORIGINAL WAS LEAGUES BETTER! Each floor acted as a maze, this one was easy just to rush from floor to floor, and you never have to fear the reaper because there's no way you'll accidentally run into him. While graphics may improve once again the vibe of the game is lost both mechanically and visually. Also what's the deal with ""rush"" it does not ""rush"" anything. There is no reason if you're over leveled for an enemy that attacking them outside of combat doesn't straight up defeat them giving you the rewards. 

Then do I need to get into the music. The music in the remake is TRASH. 

Alright, going to just mention one last thing the did that follows in the destroyed vibe of the game. Watch the final boss fight side by side between P3 and P3R. You will see which one feels better. 

So should you get this game...sure. It is nice to not have to have an old playstation or to use an emulator to play the game, and some of the added content is nice, However we can build a community project to add these features to the original P3 and when that happens there is no reason to play p3R. 

They could have done better, they should have done better, they should have stayed true to the original vision of the game instead of giving it the low quality of modernity treatment.",1708482088,1708498378,False,5,1,0.324312031269073486,0,True,False,False

Luckily, I played this game alongside my friend who is an OG Persona fan and played the original P3 unlike me who is fairly new to the franchise and has only played 5 and 4. This review will be made from both of our perspectives. I will be writing down my friends perspective based off of words he gave me and any criticisms he had about the game. My perspective will include a lot of comparing to P5R as that's my base understanding of Persona games at this point in time.

New Player: I've always loved that Persona games could get me to smile and giggle because of the nonsensical dialogue in one moment to bringing me to the lowest point of my life in the next. This game in no exception. Whether it was a social link or a story event there were many moments like this. This games story has definitely resonated with me more than Persona 5 and I haven't even finished it at the time of this review. This game was visually stunning and is definitely a step up from P5R. I tried playing P5R after a few hours of P3R and couldn't believe the shift in quality. It's much more apparent that you think. Game play-wise, I didn't find much difference between P3R and P5R except for a few differences. Those differences being the shuffle-time over negotiations, and various affinity changes. It's no P4G shuffle time but it still trumps negotiations and the fact that it was left up to dialogue choices unless you had a specific perk from a confidant. There's also the Theurgy which in my eyes are like showtime moves from P5R except they're less random. I have to say, I really do like that each team member has their own base physical element. It allows for more interesting team compositions compared to P5R where I kind of just threw together a team because I wanted a certain perk from confidants or because I liked the character. I played the game on Hard mode and it caused me to think a lot more about things like that as well as what kind of personas I should be using as well. At some point in the game I was able to basically abuse the fusion system and inherit all of the skill I wanted onto one persona with a high STR or MAG stat and nuke enemies. However, I stilled faced my fair share of difficult fights and had to restart my Tartarus run or main boss fights. Eventually I was able to also abuse the rarity fortunes and grind money and exp in Tartarus as well as healing items, sp items, and twilight fragments. Outside of combat Social links, although not having the perk system that confidants did, I found more enriching than in P5R. Characters where much more memorable and likable with the setting being a bit more realistic. Some characters that to my knowledge didn't have social links in the original and still don't either now have hangout events that sort of adapt the perk system from confidants by allowing for buffs in combat or for theurgies. Outside of gameplay, the story was very interesting. The cast was really good in my opinion and there were some scenes where I felt their deliveries carried the entire emotion of the scene. So a huge compliment to them. I know that pretty much all persona games have unrealistic settings as it's a supernatural, superpower, fantasy situation but compared to P5R the story felt more coherent. The story felt a lot less all over the place while still keeping it's fair share of mystery. I know that the beauty of P5's story is that it was like a puzzle you had to piece together but it honestly got annoying having to stop after main story segment and select vague dialogue options because the context was hidden to you. It lead to a greater conclusion but caused a clunky mid-game. My last thing I have to say about P3R is that it's BGM is phenomenal. One of the key factors as to why I was so giddy all the time while playing was due to the incredible soundtrack. Although I have a select few in P5R that I still find incredible today, I think that overall P3R has better music.

The review from here on will be words I received from my friend about the game. He didn't talk so much about combat as it wasn't exactly what he was paying attention to when observing my game play.

OG Player: I love Persona and Persona 3 is one of my favorite games of all time. I was excited to see this game being remade but was interested to see what they had done or changed. I noticed that the game was way more vibrant and colorful compared to the original which is nice and it made the game feel like a quality game but it took away from the charm that the original had. The saturated colors of the original felt like it fit the theme of the game more and set the mood better. Aside from that, it was cool to see modern models and artwork of the characters I love. The social links are pretty much the same, noticed a few new things that came with the visuals such as a character cut-out for the Hermit S.L. I really enjoy the introduction of the hangout feature as it allows for people to really become attached to some of the other team members who lack social links. I'm not sure if they repurposed content from the FEMC content but it still includes a storyline and character arc for each team member. I wasn't too fond of the new voice actors at first but they grew on me overtime. Especially Junpei as I though the new VA didn't sound that much like the original. I also found the delivery of lines to be not as impactful such as the chairman. Although his jokes aren't supposed to be funny the delivery in the original at least gave me a chuckle. When it comes to the BGM I noticed a few changes. The opening to the game has changed and although full moon, full life is good. Burn my Dread stands on top. I also noticed that some BGM is the same but altered. for example, the dorm BGM sounds almost like a remix of the original. It's not bad but it's also not the same. Which was my overall POV on the game.

Overall, this is a good Persona game none the less. To OG players, it might be disappointing to see that not much has changed aside from some quality of life aspects and visual changes. the size of areas are the same meaning this game is smaller in scale to Persona 5. So is it worth the $70 pricetag? Well, to newer players yes. This is a complete experience for blind players like me no matter if the game is smaller or shorter than P5R. The game has an expected playtime of 50 hrs for the main story but I'm not even done and have over that amount. Of course because I've been entangled in the games side content. For older players, it's still a refreshing experience. The changes made are enough that it doesn't just feel like you're just playing through the original again. If the main factor that is driving away you OG players is the pricetag. Then you're best bet is to wait for a sale.",1708495386,1708495386,True,2,0,0.469696968793869019,0,True,False,False

On the Real, Persona 3 Reload fixes the flaws that the OG had and revamps its gameplay for a more complete experience. The gameplay can be a bit grindy and repetitive at times, but I'd say that's more towards the end game where most of the things you should be doing are already done.  If it wasn't for it's story, Persona 3 Reload would be an easy 7/10, but it's saving grace is its STORY. This game takes risks that future Persona games are afraid to take, all the while setting the design for it's two future games in the series.

The main story and big bosses did not feel that interesting compared to the other entries in the series, and some of the characters were really unlikable which made hangouts quite tedious sometimes. But, P3R did also have some of the most memorable characters I have seen in the series, notably: Aigis, Elizabeth, Kamiki, and Tanaka. Tartarus was also less tedious than Mementos but the lack of palaces or just intentional area design did make it a bit stale after so many floors. P3R also lacks of the follow up story DLC which many would say is essential to the themes presented throughout the game. I was still satisfied with the ending but did find it a bit confusing contextually. Although this remake does look and play amazing, I would still suggest newcomers to the series start at Persona 5 Royal instead and work your way backwards to Reload. It will help you appreciate both the other games in the series and the strong points of P3R that will hopefully carry forward into Persona 6.",1708450707,1708486590,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Things I really enjoyed:[/b]
[*]Shifts (baton passes) are the most satisfying transitions ever.
[*]Inari giving daily skill cards - is a bit OP but I like it, it diversifies how you can build your Persona early game.
[*]A lot more voiced scenes in social links and other moments.

If you LOVED Persona 3 whether it be the OG version, FES, or the male route in P3P then I highly recommend getting this game especially since it now has Skill Selection during fusion something none of the other versions ever had. Maybe get it on sale since $70 is a bit much.

It is widely known to many that P3 has the best story among the other Persona games but the original installment did not allow players to control their characters during battle (MC excluded). Persona 3 Reload solves that problem and brings in a significant graphics overhaul to the game.

While I still prefer P4 and P5 overall, P3 is still one of the best RPGs out there and boasts the best finale arc.

Persona 3 is one of my favourite games of all time and I've waited so long for a remake that it kind of feels surreal to finally have one.
It improves so many aspects of the old 2006 release, bringing it in line with modern game design aspects, mainly to Persona 5.

For anyone not having played Persona 3 at all: Keep in mind that this game is very heavily leaning into its two main gameplay loops: Dungeon crawling and school activities / hanging out with people in your free time. If you for example hate dungeon crawling, I would not advise to buy this as you spend a lot of time in Tartarus. It was vastly improved compared to the original Tartarus, but it's still a lot if you are not expecting this kind of gameplay.

The good:
* One of my favourite stories/settings of all time
* Graphics are gorgeous
* Great sound design and voices
* Modern gameplay, A LOT of QoL improvements
* A vastly improved Tartarus experience

The not-so-good:
* OST is hit or miss - some tracks (new and old) are banger, while others are meh compared to their old versions
* Some outdated gameplay elements were left in, like having a Game Over as soon as the main character dies in combat
* No The Answer (post story arc) and no female main character, but maybe those will be added via DLC

All in all, if you are a fan of JRPGs with great stories and like dungeon crawling mixed with leisure activities, then you are in for one hell of a ride here.",1708336499,1708429462,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

With revamped visuals, enhanced gameplay mechanics, and additional content, Persona 3 Reloaded offers both longtime fans and newcomers a compelling journey into the depths of the Dark Hour.

Graphically, Persona 3 Reloaded shines with its updated visuals that bring the game into the modern era. Character models, environments, and UI elements have been given a fresh coat of paint, resulting in a more polished and visually appealing experience. The vibrant colors, stylish character designs, and attention to detail contribute to the game's immersive world, enhancing the sense of immersion and atmosphere.

Gameplay improvements in Persona 3 Reloaded provide a more streamlined and accessible experience while retaining the strategic depth that defines the Persona series. Combat mechanics have been refined to offer smoother and more responsive gameplay, making battles feel more engaging and dynamic. The addition of quality-of-life features, such as fast travel options and improved party management, reduces tediousness and enhances the overall flow of the game.

One of the highlights of Persona 3 Reloaded is the expanded content that adds depth and replay value to the experience. New social links, story events, and gameplay mechanics enrich the game's narrative and character development, allowing players to forge deeper connections with the inhabitants of the game world. The inclusion of additional personas, skills, and dungeons provides fresh challenges for veterans while offering new players a wealth of content to explore.

The audio design in Persona 3 Reloaded remains as exceptional as ever, with a memorable soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's themes and atmosphere. The haunting melodies, upbeat tunes, and atmospheric sound effects contribute to the immersive experience, drawing players further into the world of Persona 3. Voice acting, a hallmark of the series, is well-executed, bringing the characters to life with emotion and authenticity.

Despite its many improvements, Persona 3 Reloaded is not without its flaws. Some may find that certain aspects of the game, such as the dated dungeon design and repetitive nature of Tartarus exploration, feel somewhat antiquated compared to more recent entries in the series. Additionally, the game's pacing can be uneven at times, with periods of intense action interspersed with slower, more dialogue-heavy segments.

In conclusion, Persona 3 Reloaded is a worthy reimagining of a classic JRPG that revitalizes the original experience for a new generation of players. With its updated visuals, refined gameplay mechanics, and expanded content, the game offers a compelling journey into the mysterious world of Persona. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer looking to experience a timeless classic, Persona 3 Reloaded delivers a captivating adventure filled with memorable characters, engaging gameplay, and emotional storytelling.

The story is just as good if not better then the original. This also defiantly rivals Persona 5 in terms of amazing polish and just how stylish the game is.

While the overall story remains the same, there are many small interactions and systems added to the experience to improve the smoothness of the journey. 

The main story additions that stuck out during my playthrough were:

-[b] Link Episodes [/b]: These provide additional interactions with your SEES squad mates individually to highlight their backstories and things they're going through at different points in the main story. A welcome addition that helps to further flesh out characters who don't have a dedicated social link for the male protagonist.
-[b] Study sessions before exams [/b]: Provide additional interactions to highlight chemistry between characters and the squad as a whole. Another welcome addition that shows it's strength especially after important events in the story, where the characters can come together as a group to bond.
-[b] New voice cast [/b]: One of the things I was more apprehensive with going into Reload, this worry turned out to be mostly unfounded. Some of the new casting choices that I particularly liked were [spoiler] Mitsuru, Junpei, Fuuka, Aigis, Yuko, Chidori, etc. [/spoiler]

The main overworld system additions that stuck out were:

-[b] Text messages [/b]: These provide an easy way to check what is available to do during the current day. These also provide additional interaction with your various social links and help to bring out more of their personality. 
-[b] Rewind [/b]: A quality of life feature that allows you to rewind to a certain day instead of reloading a save. Convenient for minmaxing or amending mistakes. Overall unnecessary, but still useful.

The main combat and Tartarus additions that stuck out were:

-[b] Theurgy [/b]: New ultimate-like attacks used by building your theury gauge during combat. Each character has a diffferent way to charge their gauge (using buffs, using physical attacks, getting critical hits, etc.). The animations are flashy and true to character. These feel very strong (at least on hard difficulty) and shave a lot of difficulty off of some encounters. 
-[b] Navigator abilities [/b]: Additional abilities to use during exploration (IE distressing enemies, providing def/spd buffs, providing an escape route, etc.). This also extends to combat where your full-scan is now activated on the same turn you use it, but you need to wait one full round before you can use it. Your navigator also has a theurgy gauge. All of these help to make that character feel more like a member of the team who is actively doing things.
-[b] Tartarus exploration changes [/b]: Locked chests, breakable pieces of the environment, a sprint key for the protagonist, Monad doors/passages, dark floors, etc. have been added to make exploration feel more interactive. Instead of running through a randomly generated terrain, maybe killing some shadows, and then going up the stairs...you are now doing that with some extra distractions in between to make it feel less monotonous. 
-[b] Great clock [/b]: A catchup mechanic that allows your teammates who you might not have used in a while to instantly catch up to you in levels. Can only be used after finding it on a floor and after using a twilight fragment to open a locked chest. Another welcome quality of life addition so you don't have to do as much monotonous grinding (grinding is largely invalidated anyways if you want to cheese by turning on peaceful difficulty to farm the reaper).
-[b] Shuffle time [/b]: Instead of keeping shuffle time the same, you will now be able to see all of the cards without playing the memory game. Now the major arcana cards have all been added to the cards in shuffle time, each unlocked with progressing the story or completing monad passages. These have different large effects (stat buffs, ability to pick extra cards in shuffle time, etc.) that help to make the Tartarus experience smoother. 

Overall, the updated Persona 3 experience was still incredibly enjoyable. As mentioned prior, it is the same story with additional character interactions and combat that doesn't make you want to contract apathy syndrome. The main issue I have with this iteration is the $70.00 USD price tag, with eventual DLC that will bump it up even more if it is The Answer. This would be more understandable if it were [i] the [/i] definitive way to play Persona 3, but the overall experience is still split between Portable with Reload replacing FES if The Answer is released as DLC. It's up to you to decide if the updated engine, additional character interactions, combat changes, and new voice cast is worth that price tag.",1708410782,1708410782,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Persona 3 has the best story but the game itself has many flaws and in my opinion didn't take enough from the newer persona games. This review isn't meant for people who believe story negates all the flaws within the game play itself. This review will mainly focus on the negatives because everyone else  has spoken on the positives.

Social System.
 Persona 3 has some of the worst social links in the series with Kenji, The Gourmet King, The Track Team manager and a few more. Another thing that really sucks about the social links in this game is not being able to have a single one with any of your male teammates. They attempted to corrected this with ""Linked Episodes' which are just worse social links. This could have been done much better if they had just replaced some social links such as  Kenjis. I know they wanted to stay true to the original  and if so they could have just added the female route that corrects almost all of these issues within the social system.

The Combat
The combat for me was a huge letdown, I had hoped they would have added more from royal, but they added a worse baton pass that was useless in most fights, a one shot ability, and seemingly making magic way weaker than physical skills. On my first fight with the reaper I wanted to use this new theurgy I had just unlocked. It was stated to be the ""Ultimate"" attack little did I know they really did mean it. I ended up one shotting the reaper who I had been looking forward to fight my whole play through. It seems like every new persona game just makes it their goal to make the reaper seem like a joke compared to how he used to be.

The Fusion System
The fusion system stayed the same as it was in the original, but more easier than before, with it all being automatic.  I wish they had added the newer fusion mechanics from royal/golden instead of just making it simpler.

Tartarus
Tartarus in reload is much easier compared to the original and seemingly more boring because of that. I completed it all in one day each time with little to no effort and became bored of it pretty fast. I was pretty disappointed that the reaper was not allowed to spawn in the first two blocks, because in my opinion that is when the game is the hardest and you have the highest chance of taking enough time for him to  actually spawn, because of this he never showed up in my play through until I actually waited for him which took way too long. Still though the music is still amazing and the design for each block was perfect making it easier to push through the later floors.

Overall I still believe the game was very good but definitely not worth 70 dollars USD. If I was to point someone towards their first persona game, it would not be this, it would be royal. Especially because we will most likely get ""The Answer"" as some overpriced DLC or get a royal edition for the game. If you really wanna see the story of Persona 3 just go watch the movie or watch someone else play.",1706864754,1708393440,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

This SLAPS. Genuinely. Pick it up ASAP

(19th Feb 2024)
Truly. I'm blown away. This game is a masterpiece through and through. Although Tartarus is grindy, the payoff is worth it. The foreshadowing, the bonds you forge, the motifs, and so on... It all pays off.

Persona 3 is beautiful.

And my only exposure to Persona prior to this was playing Persona 5 Royal two years ago. So this was my first time with the Persona 3 experience. When comparing Persona 3 to Persona 5, I'll admit I think the gameplay of Persona 5 was slightly better, and definitely had more flair. But the story, characters, and structure of Persona 3 hit me like a truck in a way I was not prepared for. 

Obviously I won't spoil the story elements, but despite feeling like the game had a slow start when I first started playing, I found myself intrigued by how well everything connected in the end, even seemingly isolated events. The story just builds on itself. I consider myself a fairly stoic person. I very much internalize my feelings, so even when experiencing intense emotion, I don't outwardly express them. But Persona 3 put actual tears in my eyes at least 3 times. That's a feat that doesn't happen often in any game. 

What most surprised me was the characters. Again, no spoilers, but I'm very used to characters in all JRPGs having their character arc and just being ""done"".  But in Persona 3, it really felt like characters developed throughout the entire game, even those you got early. I will say that I think the voice actors all nailed the roles for each and every character. I know there was some debate about characters being recast from the OG, but in terms of viewing the game on its own, I think every VA absolutely nailed it with their deliveries.

True to Persona fashion, you build your relationships with characters, both party members and NPCs. Interesting to note that the male party members don't have social links but still have hangout episodes which are arguably just as valuable for character development. My only criticism about social links is that the party member social links are very back-loaded by only really being fully accessible in the 2nd half of the game. But even that has narrative significance in the sense of building those relationships over the game. 

Gameplay-wise, although I did say that I slightly prefer P5, the game is still classic turn based fun with modern QoL. The concept is familiar; your Personas determine your abilities and stats, with the MC having multiple Personas and your party having one each. Hitting a weakness will knock down an enemy, and knocking down all enemies triggers an all out attack for big damage. You get an extra turn per knockdown, and can pass your turn to another party member after a knockdown to specifically target weaknesses. What sets P3's gameplay apart from P5 is Theurgy, a mid-game ""super move"" that all party members have, and most ignore resistances/immunities. Considering different party members have different conditions for charging Theurgy, it keeps the strategy fresh. 

Much of Persona 3's gameplay takes place in Tartarus, which is an extremely long dungeon that you progress through during the game, with each border to the next segment being gated by game progression. It was notorious in the OG, but in the remake, it's not bad! I will mention that it sometimes suffers from some minor frame drops, not to the extent of chugging, but Tartarus's visuals effects do slow down the game somewhat on occasion. 

Now, I'm sure there's one big question and that question is length. Persona 5 was infamously long after all, so how does Persona 3 compare? I beat the game at 76 hours, so I'd say an average is about 80. It's long, but not obscenely so like P5, so it's more reasonable. 

And of course, the music slaps. While music is subjective and I know some people prefer the OG songs, every song I heard did a good job evoking the desired emotion, whether it be dread, hype, or depression. The music lives rent free in my mind at all times. 

Overall, I say this very rarely, but this game was a 10/10 for me personally. Will it be for everyone? Maybe not. But for any lover of RPGs, Persona games, or just stories with well written characters, Persona 3 Reload is a must play. I absolutely adore this game.",1708385055,1708385055,True,74,1,0.859681129455566406,0,True,False,False

Also this is probably the hardest I've been hit by a Persona story. Whilst I like P4 and P5 (P1 and P2 aren't real) the themes around death hits very close to home and is something that is timeless. Performances by the dub cast were great and the game looks amazing. 

Only complaints I have is that the PC port felt a bit unoptimized around certain parts however some tweaking and (hopefully) a performance patch should solve that. Otherwise this is probably the best the Persona franchise has to offer in the modern day.

Good, but it's not the definitive version like some others claim. It's the version I'll most likely replay again and again, but it's not what I'd call 'definitive. I don't feel like there's ever gonna be a definitive edition of P3. 

I enjoy it, and am on my second playthrough rn (my first was on game pass), and I think in terms of gameplay it's a strong update. The dub cast, if youre familiar with the old, takes some getting used to, but I think the end product is overall much better. Believe it or not, a dub made 20 years after the initial game's release is better, who could have thought.

it does face some modern megaten-isms that mess with the balance of the core game, though, and I think it suffers there. Theurgy gets out of control by the end of the game. I don't think you should be able to charge or concentrate theurgies because of the sheer damage it can dump out, or maybe they just shouldn't be able to crit. One shotting gatekeeper bosses is fun at first, but then you realise youre doing it to every gatekeeper. Stacking crit is obscenely strong for most of the main game and very little outside of the superboss will really challenge you.

it also loses a lot of the art design from the original title. Now, let me preface this by saying that I think P3 does some very pretty things with it's UI, and yes, it does have a very nice menu. However, the complete loss of the old art style for anime cutscenes is an honest travesty, the new p5-esque style of cutscenes are a lot blander. They look fine, but when compared to the old one, there's an atmosphere that is completely lost on this game. It's like the life has been drained out of it, replaced with something that is, on the surface, prettier because it's in HD. 

Just compare the awakening scene from the original title to the awakening scene in this, that is the best example of what I mean.

I also kind of wish that it changed more about P3. November and December are still very dead months that grind the pacing to a halt, There are some old plot holes that were in the original script that remain even now, even some errors that were in the original translation that have remained unfixed. Also why is the Hermit link still like that? Please stop that, Atlus. Why does every modern persona game need a resident groomer character, the PS1 titles didn't need that. 

All in all, it's good. My expectations were low, and I'm happy to be wrong. I wish it changed more things in some areas, I wish it didn't change some others, but the full package is a solid experience that I had a lot of fun with.",1708330515,1708330515,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Persona 5 was my first experience with the MegaTen franchise back in 2017 and I instantly fell in love with it. Naturally, after completing the game, I tried my hand at the earlier entries; starting with Persona 3. The story really piqued my interest and I was really excited to get back to fusing Demons in the Velvet Room. However, I found it hard to keep engaging with the game due to it's archaic systems and graphics, so I dropped it about 3 months into the game's school year.

Fastforward 7 years later, I picked it back up with Persona 3 Reload and the game is astounding. From what I've played the plot seems pretty intact and faithful to the original source material. Although, the pacing early on is a bit slow and sometimes story elements are a bit all over the place, the game really finds its groove during the month of July. Every Social Link is unique and exposes the protagonist to their daily struggles. I especially loved The Sun Arcana Social Link and his journey to come to terms with his own fleeting mortality. Every one of them is very impactful and a real joy to experience.

On a another note, the new dynamic UI elements really help to liven the game up and bring it to par with Person 5's UI design, all while giving it it's own unique and distinct flair. The sound design is also on point by reorchestrating the original tracks that made the game special and by adding some new one's into the mix. The new ""It's Going Down Now"", ""Color your Night"" and the remixed version of ""Changing Seasons"" particularly stand out. In my eyes, the Persona soundtracks still stand leagues above the rest.

Combat is still amazing with the Press Turn/1 More system that keeps turn based battles fast paced and engaging all while rewarding strategic thinking. There's not a lot more to say on the matter.

In short, Persona 3 Reload is nothing short of a masterpiece. With an amazing visual style, great combat, fantastic soundtrack and a moving story to boot, it certainly holds a very special place in my heart and might as well have cemented itself as my new favorite game in the franchise.

I played this game in different points of my life and every time i get older and play this game again there is something new for me to learn as you start to see the whole picture of what this game wants to say.
Reload is the perfect opportunity to everyone who wants to experience P3 in the best way possible. It has a few changes from P3P or P3FES that some like, some don't. but Reload is amazing as it is.

My first contact with the Persona franchise was through Persona 3 Portable. It quickly became one of my favorite games, prompting me to play the other titles in the series.
Did Atlus do a good job with Persona 3 Reload? Absolutely. Atlus did an excellent job for Persona 3 fans, enhancing what was already nearly perfect.

The story and characters are the same. Almost nothing has been altered.
If you think you would miss the female protagonist, mainly because of her social links, they added the ""Linked Episodes""  that work like a social link without arcana and don't need to worry about dialogue choices. The characters that have the linked Episodes are Junpei, Akihiko, Koromaru, Shinjiro and Ken. Some new content around the city to facilitate your life and progressions with Social links and Social Stats 

The combat and Tartarus are great and enjoyable. My issue with the Original Game was that Tartarus became boring after a few hours due to the lack of variety in the content and the similarity of each floor. In Persona 3 Reload, the floors and the blocks are quite ""unique"" and with new content added. ""Monad Doors"" is where you can go to defeat a boss and get rewards. They also removed Margaret from the game and her challenges. The game now has the ""Shift"" mechanic, it is like Baton Pass from Persona 5.

The voice cast is fantastic, and the already good OST is even better. I enjoy the Persona game OSTs, especially the Persona 3 original soundtrack. However, everything sounds perfect here. I had the pleasure of listening to one of the best game soundtracks.

If you enjoyed Persona 3 or other games in the series and want to play this title but are hesitant to pay a high price for it, I believe Persona 3 Reloaded is worth every penny.",1708285718,1708285718,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Gameplay wise, I really enjoy the switch up between dungeon crawling & turn based RPG and optimizing your everyday schedule. They influence each other and keeps me from getting bored of either one

It has the hard difficulty, great characters, and the best Persona story, in my opinion, all in this amazing remake. Did I mention that it has a BANGER soundtrack? Because it does! From songs like ""Color Your Night"", to ""It's Going Down Now"", all the original music is AMAZING! However, some of the Reload songs, remix's of the old songs, aren't as good as the original like ""Mass Destruction"". It will take some getting used to, especially if you are really used to the old songs, but there are some good Reload songs as well like ""Changing Seasons"". It really comes down to just getting used to them.  If you are a fan of the original P3, are new to P3, or just want to try out a JRPG, I could not recommend this game enough.

but Persona 3 Reload does a good job of balancing the old with the new while keeping the original feel and mood mostly intact.

In terms of gameplay and visuals, it's improvements all around. The main criticism you can level here is that it's too easy to become overpowered. That's sort of an Atlus trademark, though, and it's plenty fun regardless.

Script-wise, I think the localizers need better proofreading and editing, as there were times where typos, missing words and excessive repetition were notable. The original Persona 3 was very competently handled, so these errors do stick out.
Interestingly enough, this is an issue in Persona 5 as well, and I'm not sure what's going on there. It's definitely my main critique, because it leaves some of the new scenes feeling disjointed, and I think the VA direction suffered as well because of this.

The new voice actors themselves do a great job, though. By and large, they're as good as the originals, and Akihiko's in particular grew on me. If you're as detail-obsessed as I am, though, you'll have to get used to differences in delivery. My biggest complaint here is the aforementioned direction, and that the volume mixing on some actors is iffy. I'd imagine whoever worked with Junpei's lines wasn't having a good day?

Since I touched on the new content - there's really quite a bit of it. Nighttime is significantly expanded in particular, with both Tartarus having more depth to it and the actual social activities you can do at night being much wider. 
It builds upon the original game's strengths in scope by adding even more on top, and the dorm is livelier than ever.

The remixes of old music tracks are a bit of a mixed bag, with some being near-identical and others being slight downgrades or shifts in mood.
However, the original, new music tracks are complete slam-dunks across the board.

As someone who's played every other version of this game multiple times - if you're considering this as your introduction to Persona in general, I think this is a great place to start. 
It's also a competent retooling of Persona 3 itself and plays more smoothly than every other Persona game before it, with immense quality of life uplifts across the board. I have my nitpicks and qualms about it (animation speedup in combat when, Atlus?), but I'd give it a 8.5-9/10 overall.",1708256391,1708256391,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Maybe I should reword that - a remake of my 2nd favorite game of all time, because atlus may have dethroned it! 

tl;dr at foot of review ;)

So I'm an avid fan of the original persona 3 for ps2. I absolutely loved the story, characters, and gameplay. Everything blended together amazingly for an experience like no other and I fell in love with it.
To say that atlus has outdone themselves for this remake would be a huge understatement. Every upgrade/addition made to the game is a positive 1.
I'll start off by clearing up that persona 3 ps2's version of tartarus (the central dungeon of the game) could be a real grind to get through. It was pretty samey and could get on many players nerves after while, especially towards the end of the game. Well somehow, someway, the crazy employees at atlus managed to fix tartarus! And not by a little bit, or by changing the vision of it entirely. I deeply respect them for sticking to the original vision of pre-generated floors to climb, while still adding in so many features that make tartarus a genuinely fun and engaging experience.
In addition to standard dungeon crawling, the persona series is famous for it's combination of social sim aspects and dungeon crawling. Persona 3 was the trailblazer that began that trend, and it changed the series. Social links (events spent with the friends you make in the game) are now fully voiced which is huge for the series. Now all the sad moments hit even harder than ever lol. Character writing is the exact same as it used to be too. 
On that note, I'm also very happy atlus stuck to their guns and didn't tone down the story whatsoever. I was a little worried that they may tone down the story to try and suit modern audiences, but I'm very happy to say that the story is exactly the same as I remember it, and I absolutely love it! In fact, with all-new added scenes and events that further develop characters who needed that development in the ps2 game, I can honestly say the story is the best its ever been! Some lines have also been reworded to make more literal sense, and all of them were for the better.
Said characters now feel fully realised, and the player incentive to bond with your allies is strong. Any new scenes are also very faithful to the original characters, and fit seamlessly within the narrative. The new character models look stunning, and blow me away every time I see them, in school life and combat.
The UI is as great as any modern atlus release, balancing smoothness, style, and functionality without overwhelming the player. The water motif used throughout the menus is as aesthetically pleasing as these menus can get, and every little detail has so much thought put into it. 
As expected with any atlus game in general, the soundtrack is simply amazing as always. Persona 3 is arguably the game that began the trend of great music in the series, with it alongside persona 4 being the reason the sound concerts exist. The tracks taken from the original game are as great as before. The remade songs are a little bit mixed, but mostly positive for me. I loved the majority of the new songs, and even prefer some over the originals now (i.e changing seasons -reload-). What about the new tracks? Well rest assured they don't disappoint, as they are all simply catchy and fantastic. Lotus juice, the man behind the rapping in many songs, is much more prominent in reload over the original, and sounds even better than he used to back in 2006! I admit I do miss yumi kawamura, the vocalist for those original games for the male mc, but azumi takahashi does an amazing job too.

The only issue I have with persona 3 reload is the lack of the answer and female protagonist. The answer, though not integral to the experience, is an addition that helps develop the main cast and conclude their character arcs upon the aftermath of what transpired in the main game. The female protagonist, as a female player, is an important part of persona 3. Again, it's not integral to the experience, but the changes it makes to the game by simply switching genders makes the game feel like a whole new experience. New social links, ost and some story changes, e.t.c. It also opens up the game to a wider demographic, i.e female players. I don't like to criticize games for what they don't contain, however, but for what they do. So it doesn't affect my view of the game, especially since they aren't required

Honestly, I knew atlus had it in them to remake persona 3 and make it a fantastic game, but I've been absolutely blown away by what we've got. I'm beyond satisfied with persona 3 reload, and I couldn't recommend it enough - especially for newcomers to the series. It's the perfect starting point, and I highly recommend anyone interested in persona give this game a try, especially since it's about half the daunting length of persona 5 royal. you can wait for a sale if you want, but I'm happy paying full price for 60+ hours of content, especially when it's such a wild roller coaster of laughter, sadness, and determination. I can't wait to jump back in and continue my 6th or so reexperience of persona 3 lol. Huge congrats atlus, you've outdone yourselves on this remake. persona 3 reload gets an easy 10/10 from me :)

Edit: After nearly clearing the game, I can say that while I'm very satisfied with what atlus has made here, I can't help but feel a little disappointed by the portrayal of some scenes in the game. the vast majority of cutscenes are great, but there are a few scenes that I found just hit the gut so much harder in the initial ps2 release. even just the 1st persona awakening scene isn't quite the same for me. additionally, while environment models generally look great, I find the lighting (or lack thereof) in certain scenery really hurt some of the immersion of the game, e.g iwatodai dorm, where lighting is so flat that there a virtually no shadows. neither of these are deal-breakers though, and are absolutely more of a nitpick than a genuine flaw that drags the product down - and because of that I still can't find it in myself to lower my rating a little lol. I still love persona 3 any which way and I'm very glad atlus decided to remake it after fan requests for years :)


tl;dr: this game is an amazing remake of persona 3 and I highly recommend the game to both series newcomers and veterans alike. waiting for a sale is a valid option, but I think it's worth full price for 60 hrs+ of gameplay. 10/10 :)",1707121703,1708254930,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Better and more interesting combat, though it does remain largely unchanged (which is good). Direct control over your party which 3 and fes did not have. A more fleshed out story, slight adjustment to some of the social links, full voice acting for all social links in Japanese and English and not to mention the 'link' hangouts with your teammates which are basically just social links that don't actually level up. 
As a remake I think it succeeds on every level besides some very minor things like some goofy looking 3d animation in cutscenes. But in a 80 hour game that's an extremely minor nitpick. 

However I do think that persona 3 has some inherent issues that are pretty much engraved in its core so they were never going to be resolved with a remake. As opposed to persona 4 and 5 I think the world can feel quite empty. There often isn't much reason to go out and try many different ways of increasing your social stats for example. Once you have found the optimal ways to get the most points per time slot, there isn¬¥t much of a reason to diverge. This is also true for other persona titles, however in persona 3 you get way less to experiment with and not many new things get added during your playthrough. 

This repetitive emptiness is also reflected in the dungeon design. While I am also not the biggest fan of persona 5 dungeons I do think tartarus is a bit too reliant on the (admittedly very solid) turn based combat. If you do not enjoy the turn based combat you will not like tartarus. This is also an issue in persona 4 but that game does a lot to make dungeons feel more distinct. Tartarus has a change up every block but otherwise it¬¥s basically the most basic way to make a player grind. As a result the game is not very difficult. Even on the highest difficulty, merciless, most people who are familiar with smt games would not struggle much. This makes sense because of the inherent ¬¥grindy¬¥ design but it is still true. Surprisingly the addition of 'theurgy' which initially seemed to me like it would be way too strong ended up being quite well integrated and overall pretty balanced and enjoyable to use.

The social links in persona 3 have always been a topic of debate among fans. As long as I have been a persona fan the general consensus among fans has always been that persona 3 has the better story while persona 4 has the better characters. Ofcourse ever since the introduction of p5 which achieved success beyond any previous persona entries combined this discourse has become more skewed towards p5 but I still think that the comparison of p3 and p4 makes more sense. Back to the social links themselves I think that some are absolutely fantastic while others leave something to be desired. I do enjoy the darker tone of most of them. I like that persona 3 is willing to have character's that are morally grey or that have problems that aren't resolved. However this is somewhat offset by the clunkiness with which some of these plotlines are written.

Something I realised when playing reload is that I actually quite like the way the antagonists are written in this game. While I do not think it's always entirely intentional, the way they are portrayed leaves it up to the player to decide on where they stand. While over the top they are sympathetic figures, for the most part. Whenever they say things I am never fully convinced of their faults and while actions speak louder than words, I do think that their words could make up for it given the situation, narratively speaking that is.

As for the story, I think it is conceptually very strong, but I have always felt that there was a lack of engagement. For me it never really felt gradual and I am glad to say that I do not find this as prevalent in reload. At helps that the world feels more lively purely because of the higher graphical fidelity. 

I understand criticism from people that wanted the femc option back from portable and I do think it should have been there, but as a persona 3 remake I can also understand the decision to not include it as some of the links are questionable at best and translating something that purely exist in a psp game would likely be quite a different task from looking at a PS2 title.

Overall I would say that as a remake this game is near perfect, I haven¬¥t even really mentioned it but I also really enjoyed the nnew soundtrack for this game. As a game I think persona 3 is great but not quite on the level of persona 4 and 5 though I do think those games feel a bit too goofy or cartoony at times. but that¬¥s a different can of worms.",1708234342,1708235842,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

While doing so, you also develop your own character and sink yourself into their shoes. Persona 3's story, although created before Persona 4 and 5, stands taller in depth and meaning than its successors because it invests more time into your friends, which makes reaching the end of this game all the more depressing.

Persona 3 Portable was my first Persona game and coming back to this title after 14 years with a face lift is an absolute dream! <3

Even though I have finished P3P in 2010, It's really nice to revisit this game, and after currently playing for 20+ hours (Not even halfway through the game) , I can confirm that this remake is for both veteran and new P3 players.

Everything from the beautiful visualization, new Theurgy system in battles, and fully voiced dialogues in Social links are what make this remake great.

The only gripe I have about this game is that some parts of the main and side stories can feel bit awkward sometimes. However, this is a remake of a 2006 game so it is understandable.

Persona 3 Reload is a fantastic game with a pretty great story (not without flaw but we will get into that) but I couldn't help but think to myself that the tower of Tartarus concept is outdated and it really feels that way when you play it.

As far as Persona games available on steam, I'd still recommend 5 first to a newcomer, then I'd recommend this. I don't think 4 golden is for me as I have abandoned it on several attempts whereas when I played P3R and P5R I made it a mission to play them through from start to finish in very short amounts of time.

To start, the story, characters and day to day of Persona 3 are all great. However when contrasting to 5 you can tell that some of the things are outdated. From what I am aware of, your social skills that you level up only impact in Social links with three individual people, not to mention there are only three, so by the time you max them out a huge chunk of evening progression feels lost (thankfully, unlike 5, they have dorm mate hang outs that both give nuggets of story, can unlock potential upgrades for partners and grant items or consumables). The unforunate byproduct is that it feels like your afternoons suffer from decision paralysis of who to spend time with while your evenings are largely barren.

As far as social links go (for P5 players, these would be the same as your confidants), the stories are really tear jerking. I felt especially moved during Maiko's storyline [spoilers] in which she talked about her parents current divorce - which viewed through the lens of a child makes it all the more heartbreaking... my only hang up with this storyline is the fact that it leaned into a child confessing to want marry the protagonist which made me feel very uncomfortable[/spoilers], as well as in Akinari's storyline [spoilers] which follows a terminally ill young adult trying to come to grips with his pending death - him creating a children's story that served as a fantastic metaphor for his character as well as the protagonist really got to me emotionally and by the time his story came to its full conclusion in the epilogue i was in full blown tears[/spoilers]. In addition to that, the story with two late additions to your team was also a story highlight [spoilers] The story of Ken Amada and his parents tragic death paired with Shinjiro Aragaki's tragic tale of not being in full control of his Persona made for a great twist that I didn't see coming. Shinjiro was one of my favorites throughout the storyline and when his story was tragically cut short (and in such a poetic way in the bossfight i might add) it really made tear up [/spoilers].

But it's not all praise however, my most major criticisms of the game lie in the hands of the games primary antagonists - this whole section will be wrapped in spoilers [spoilers] I like the idea of Strega as a whole, but they largely felt under utilized and explored to me. I would have really enjoyed it if they had mirrored their team to be opposites of SEES. Chidori being a noted counterpart to Fuuka, and Takaya an obvious counterpart to the protagonist, why not add an additional two that could be paired against Mitsuru & Sanada? Jin felt like a largely nothing character who just looked up to Takaya, but Chidori had a very interesting arc and her end was another high point for the game when her Persona fused with Junpei. Unlike Chidori who had a great character ending, Jin's felt like wasted time and Takaya's felt wrong to me. Junpei should have been FILLED WITH RAGE upon seeing Takaya and had to either be stopped or convinced to stop or maybe even an option to let him finish Takaya - Takaya was responsible for the deaths of Chidori AND NOTED SEES MEMBER AND CLOSE FRIEND TO SANADA AND MITSURU, SHINJIRO ARAGAKI! Not showing their mixed emotions and just turning the other cheek felt wholly wrong, especially given Takaya's lethality. It felt to me like they wanted him to witness the final battle and it didn't feel earned.
Beyond Strega though, my biggest complaint with antagonists would have to lie squarely on Ikutski's shoulders. I had a bad feeling about him just because of his callousness towards certain things, but otherwise didn't expect him to be wholly evil and responsible for a lot of the problems. For him to be introduced as a villain, only to be killed off minutes later in a cutscene felt SO OUT OF LEFT FIELD AND ANTI-CLIMACTIC that i can't help but just feel like it was shoehorned in to give Mitsuru some misplaced character development. [/spoilers]

In summary, the game is great, It has many of my favorite Persona moments - in certain ways it has the best of what Persona has to offer - but it isn't my favorite of the series and I have many of own gripes that drags it down from being a perfect release to me. The story is there, the dark themes are there, but the execution of certain character arcs, and some subpar, outdated, repetive game mechanics made what otherwise could have been a masterpiece into a great but flawed title.

I would recommend Persona 5 Royal to any first time player of the series over this, but if you are looking to scratch the itch and aren't intimidated by some heavy topics and themes, this is a great use of your time and will provide at least 65+ hours of entertainment",1708222731,1708222731,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-Update

I loved this story so much also spoilers!





The story was simply amazing the way that makoto smiles as he dies in peace knowing he is next to all of his friends is just insane to me. The whole reason he was alive was to fulfill his purpose of sealing nyx which is just mind boggaling. 

The gameplay was honestly just alright with me. Since I have played most persona games I understand typing and ailments, so it was just kind of similar to the other games, however the gameplay loop did tend to get a bit boring after reaching floor 200. I think if there was only 200 floors instead of 300 I would have enjoyed it more. With that being said the Theurgy moves were my favorite part of the game with the complex animation as well as mixing it with concentrate and charged.

The music was complex and made me genuinely emotional nothing else to say other than each song set the tone for every fight/cinematic truly peak.

Best ending in a game in a while.

Other than that my updated rating is a solid 8.6 its flawed but still made me emotional. Atlus if persona 6 is like this you will be cooking and getting 70 more of my dollars.",1707020716,1708219849,True,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

It's truly a complete feeling. It's like finishing a period in your life where everything was so exciting and new. It's the feeling of parting with your beloved friends and have to come to terms with reality.

Persona is truly an experience I wish on everyone. Any game. Any persona is truly enough to teach a person. My first was p5 as was most likely for the majority. Then it was progress through my persona(l) favorite p4g and finally here. Yes I plan to play the first two games, but these three is specific just leave such a mark. That kind of mark cannot be attained easily.

If I were to sell you on persona, I'd probably praise the music, story and characters. That is especially true in 3, 4 and 5. At least in my personal opinion. 

Now after my common rant. Persona 3 reload is an amazing experience that truly takes the genre to the next level. It was the turning point for the series back then, and I'm glad to be able to say that it did it again. After playing this I really want to play the original, which I happen to own, but first I'll play the other games again.

The persona trilogy (3,4,5) is my favorite game trilogy of all time, easily. It's full of joy and sadness. It's at times difficult and at times easy. It can feel boring, but that's life. It truly has served me well in escapism and has supported me through depression. They haven't cured it, but goddamn do they make it easier to live with.

Persona 3 has always interested me with it's themes surrounding death. And yeah I get the ""Oh that's so emo"" thing and all, but god it's so well implemented. The overall philosophy of the persona series is so fascinating. I highly recommend watching essays on this series.

But yeah overall it's kind of ok 15/10

For anyone who hasn't played P3 before, this is almost certainly the best possible way to experience it. Some very important things are missing, I personally still can't believe that they chose to not include the answer or the female protagonist (though one can always hope), those things are not what matters for someone who hasn't even played the journey before.

As far as the things that this does rather than what it does not, I think it nails almost everything that it does. There is a little bit of atmosphere compared to og P3/P3Fes, and that is in my opinion the one thing that it does not fully nail. It's not fully gone, but it is severely diminished. The music is great as always, with the new vocalist being pretty good, though she is a lot better on the new original tracks than one the ones that were remade. The combat feels great like in all modern persona games. I played through the entire game on merciless, and while it was not nearly as easy of a game as persona 5 royal, I still would not really say I was challenged. I died a couple of times near the start of the game, but once you've got access to more personas and the skills they come with, the game is still a complete breeze to go through. The theurgy skills they added are also ludicrously busted and obliterate any sort of difficulty from orbit. For example (final boss spoilers): [spoiler]I was able to basically oneshot each of nyx's 13 phases with just a tarukaja up on a character, without even debuffing nyx's defence by chaining theurgy attacks together. kinda ridiculous lmao[/spoiler]. However, it's still pretty fun to play, even if it is rather easy for the most part.

Overall, this is a very very good remake, but man when will Atlus stop pulling an Atlus whenever they release a game, you know? Like it's ridiculous that they chose to remake base persona 3 without any of the other extra things from fes or portable, but then again I did also buy this game so that's not really helping. Regardless, Persona 3 Reload is really good, it's a very very good game.",1708200371,1708200433,True,1,0,0.526578068733215332,0,True,False,False

Atlus has outdone themselves in revitalizing this classic, infusing it with new life while staying true to the original's soul. The game seamlessly blends elements of traditional Japanese RPGs with a compelling social simulation, creating a rich, multifaceted world that is both engaging and emotionally resonant.

[b]Visual and Audio Upgrades:[/b] The most striking improvement in ""Persona 3 Reload"" is the visual and audio overhaul. The graphics have been updated to stunning HD, making every scene more immersive. The character models are more detailed, and the animations smoother, bringing the world of ""Persona 3"" into vivid clarity. The soundtrack, always a highlight of the series, has been remastered, with some tracks re-imagined, adding depth to both the battles and the more poignant moments of the story.

[b]Enhanced Gameplay:[/b] Gameplay-wise, ""Persona 3 Reload"" maintains the series' challenging turn-based combat but introduces refined mechanics that make battles more strategic and rewarding. The addition of new Personas and the ability to directly control party members adds layers of strategy previously unexplored in the original. These improvements make combat encounters feel fresh and invigorating, even for those familiar with the original game.

[b]Deep Storyline and Characters:[/b] At its heart, ""Persona 3"" has always been about its story and characters, and ""Reload"" enhances these aspects beautifully. The narrative is deep and engaging, touching on themes of friendship, mortality, and the struggles of adolescence. The expanded dialogue and additional scenes provide further depth to the already well-developed characters, making each of their journeys feel more personal and impactful.

[b]Social Link Expansion:[/b] The Social Link system, a hallmark of the series, is expanded in ""Reload,"" offering more opportunities to explore the relationships between characters. These interactions not only provide insight into the characters' backstories but also affect gameplay, influencing the strength and abilities of your Personas.

[b]Overall Experience:[/b] ""Persona 3 Reload"" is more than just a nostalgia trip; it's a testament to how a classic can be transformed into something new and exciting without losing what made it special in the first place. It's a game that will resonate with newcomers and long-time fans alike, offering an experience that is both familiar and fresh.

In conclusion, ""Persona 3 Reload"" is a must-play title that beautifully balances its RPG elements with a compelling narrative and character development. It's a rare gem that reminds us why we fell in love with gaming in the first place.  My only complaint is that Atlus removed Junpei's classic line [i]""Woot!

I realised this game isn't fun and the story unlike what everyone said it was simply isn't entertaining. 

The social links are dull and uninteresting, tartarus is 254 floors of nothing, the music is a little boring and the game is simply way too easy. I see no point in continuing the remaining 40 hours when I'm bored out of my mind and skipping dialogue.

Mass destruction and monthly boss fight music + night time music was great however
Also a few minor things were removed from the original, some laziness here and there. I personally wouldn't recommend this game to myself from 3 weeks ago but it's not bad as much as it is horrendously boring for me specifically.

So I had a lot of expectations going into Reload, what I was expecting was a faithful yet definitive edition of Persona 3. After 30 hours I think I'm confidant enough to say yes, with some minor gripes that are not going to bug the casual player.

Almost everything from the original P3 makes it in here, Social Links, requests, same story, same characters and only one main dungeon throughout the entire game. If you're going in this game from Persona 5 please remember that while systematically it is similar, the game's entire structure is different. But this is great imo, because the structure still works great for me 14 years later. 

The battle mechanics and Social Link mechanics have been vastly improved and modernized. If you were turned off by P3's aged combat and Social Link system, fear no more. If you are familiar with Persona 5's combat and Confidant system, you will feel right at home. My only gripe with Reload is the decision to not include the Female Protagonist option from Persona 3 Portable, including this inclusive and loved feature would vastly improve this game's quality and replayability immensely, this would make this the true definitive way to play and experience Persona 3. This doesn't downgrade Reload's overall quality but it's a feature I still wish they included.

The Persona team really outdid themselves this time around. 

As a remake it stayed true to the original and made the original better and more easier to emphatize and relate with.

This is one of the few newer games wherein I was willing to give my body and soul to play.

Though you won't be able to go the entire game without ever seeing these additions once, you will at least have to option to just, not use them if you are so inclined.

The story starts simple enough, but takes you to places typical for games made by ATLUS, and boy does it hit in the most heart-wrenching of ways. As everyone here probably knows, Persona is the more emotional, angsty younger brother to the Shin Megami Tensei series, yet that doesn't mean there's nothing here that fans of the latter wouldn't love- at least, that's what I think, as a fan of both.

If you're expecting something super hard, this game has it's challenges, but if you're just playing on Normal like me because you're not exactly sure where you stand, you won't have to worry about any spikes in difficulty or overly easy boss fights.

The music is amazing and hits every spot it's trying to perfectly. Mass Destruction and It's Going Down Now are permanently burned into my head now, but I don't hate that one bit.

For reference, I'm typing this after beating the game, and sure some of this could be recency bias, but as someone who grew up with the Portable version of this game, later went on to play FES, and is finally playing this version, it's everything I could have hoped for- minus the exclusion of FeMC and The Answer, though I suppose I could always hope it comes along as DLC, eh?

Persona 3 Reload is a shot for shot remake which has it's problems, there is new stuff yes but so far it's the same exact game, i did not miss grinding my ass off in tarturus, most boring main dungeon in any game period. I wouldn't recommend P3 to anyone only for those who played 4 or 5 because P3 takes years to get going, P5 and 4 have an amazing beginning hook that stuck to me.

For the original my thoughts, the ending was when it actually got good


10/10 - Yukari is still a b!tch



REAL REVIEW, after beating game SPOILERS


To start

Now, i think the biggest misleading thing were the trailers for the game because it made it seem like it was a reimagining of the entire story but no, it's the exact same story no changes which i have big problems with like 2009 writing for Persona was very questionable but i guess they didn't mind. Another thing that kinda annoyed me is that they replaced some of the anime cutscenes with pre rendered ones which some work and some don't. Added ""some"" new scenes but honestly this was their opportunity to make the game longer since their not limited to ps2 hardware, like maybe setting the game back further to like Jan 5th or something


Characters - I'll start with the voices since you can never replace the original's, the new voices are pretty forgetful, like i know the voice acting was bad in the original but Shinji's voice in the OG sounded like he didn't give a single fuck about anything while this voice is basically ""Ehh whatever"" type voice, and speaking of Shinji, bro did not survive one boss fight like seriously? i think his death is unnecessary in the story, yeah he's going to die anyway but why even make him a party memeber if he last's one month!? i thought they would fix this in the remake but no. For the others i don't really care about, like how am i suppose to care about Yukari if she's a b!itch the entire game and gets into everyone's personal business, Junpei is kinda like able he goes through his character growth but bro acts the same as he did at the beginning like he didn't go through some trauma shit, you'd think he be more serious after what happened but no



Social links - Is it me or couldn't they added more to like Akihiko, Junpei, Ken, esc, i know that would be more for Nyx but still, they instead decide to do like social episodes instead where you hang out with them but don't really get anything in return like in P5 a character would protect you if their link is strong, but here it's nothing. At least we got Scott the Woz back


Combat - What can i say? it's just P5's but reskinned, that's pretty much it, there's baton passes and stuff and showtime is replaced with character limit breaks


Music - They didn't need to remix some of the music because i think the OG's music still holds up


Nyx - Why her own section? well it's because she might be the easiest boss in the game i was underleveled on Merceless and beat her first try, f_cking Takya was way stronger than her, and the view of the battle does not hit the same as the OG where in the OG Nyx is this towering giant looming over you and you have this battle view of you looking up at her as she fills the entire screen. I will note and won't forget it, i beat her with her own attack, i had mirrors and deflected in her final phase and killed her instantly, that was a highlight. And last battle (Burn my dread - last battle) doesn't hit as hard as the OG though sadly


Cutscenes - They really love mo capped and it looks so silly and overexaggerated movement during serious scenes is very distracting

Closing thoughts

Nothing else to say it's the exact same game but a major upgrade to the original, is it worth $70 bucks? no wait for a sale or play it on gamepass while it's on there unless your a major Persona fan like me

The tedious, boring nature of Tartarus, and the promising yet at times stale feeling atmosphere caused both FES and Portable to never give the true respect that Persona 3 really deserved.

All that changed...

I can confidently say that Persona 3 Reload is indeed the definitive version of Persona 3. 

Atlus made wonderful improvements to Tartarus like plentiful loot drops, shuffle card updates, and Shifts (a Baton Pass esque feature) to make the core combat game play feel wayyy less tedious. Atlus definitely leveraged the outstanding game play ideas of Persona 5. It's actually a joy to go into Tartarus instead of a slog.

P3 Reload has a beautiful, living vibe to it. It's the first Persona game to feature fully voiced social links. Hearing side characters speak actual dialogue is akin to the old phrase ""show not tell""; I'd like to hear the emotion in the characters and not just read it. The entire cast of voice actors and voice actresses do a phenomenal job. Atlus also added gorgeous Unreal Engine backgrounds and dynamic lightings throughout the different settings. All of this makes the most grim Persona game, ironically, feel the most alive.

I genuinely love this game, and I put it up there with my love for Persona 5 Royal. It's everything a remake should be.

This was done by people that certainly care about Persona 3 and not just the same thing with enhanced graphics to make money. I paid a lot, but this was worth every single penny. I had the nostalgy of playing this game that was so important to me in my teenage days mixed with this great feeling of having my experience enhanced in ALL possible ways!

From the game's graphics, it's soundtrack and to the many new events and dialogues that makes the whole thing more immersive and impactful. Persona 3 was a very impactful game as it was, but now i can say confidently that it is even more. If you manage to use well your time to explore all the new features, you'll have an opportunity to feel more connected to the characters, and many points of the story that were limited to interpretation are now much clearer, like the part of the Kirijo Group in the whole plot, not going into more details in respect to those who can be spoiled by my review. Tartarus also feels more dynamic and it's looks are amazing in every blok. Also the new features, specially how Monad is being used now, makes it a lot more insteresting.

I love how the romanceable social links also feel more immersive now, specially with the possibility of actually choosing this time, instead of forcefully having to date all of them, lol. One downside though, is that the soundtrack of the last battle was a bit disappointing, i liked the original better, but it's a matter of personal opinion, and the rest of the soundtrack was way better than the original, also in my opinion. Oh, and it would be even more cool if merciless mode would force us to have teammates controlled by AI as it was in the original for a harder difficulty, but i guess we can just turn off direct commands for that, but still, it's also a matter of personal opinion, doesn't make it any less of a masterpiece.

As a VERY dedicated Persona (And SMT) fan, I have been looking forward to this remake for a VERY long time, and despite the current gaming world, I am VERY impressed by this remake.

10/10, would shoot myself again.

---{ Graphics }---
It's a Persona game, I shouldn't need to say more. BUT, I like yapping, so I will. Even with the absolute graphical masterpiece of a game Persona 5 is, Persona 3 Reload somehow makes it ever so slightly better. As far as the style and vibe, they are both around the same level of awesomeness, but the advantage Persona 3 Reload has is that it is running on a much better engine (Unreal Engine 4), as well as higher quality lighting, textures, and models.

It says a lot about a game when you can spend 20+ minutes just staring at the screen looking at everything there is to see and still have a great time. If there is one thing anyone will agree on, it's that Persona games look AMAZING, and this one is no exception.

---{ Gameplay }---
Again, it's a Persona game, and Atlas didn't disappoint. No matter what you like to do, you will have a blast with it here. Maybe you want to talk to women, something you can't do in real life. Well, there are the emotionally engaging Social Links for that. Maybe you're like me and want to find the best way to brutally murder monsters, something a little easier than talking to women. Well, there are well over 100 Personas to choose from, and who-knows-how-many builds to make from them?

No matter who you are, you will definitely fall in love with the game.

---{ Audio }---
I played on the English dub, and MAN, the acting is on point. It may be one of the best dubs I have ever heard. The comedic bits are done perfectly, emotional moments are ABSOLUTELY chilling, it's just *chef's kiss* perfect.

Also they have my boy Alejandro Saab. So that's a plus.

---{ Can you run it? }---
Most of the time, it runs very well. I get between 100 to 120 fps running 1440p in most areas. Paulownia Mall gets strangely laggy with reflections turned on, sometimes dropping as low as 50 fps, and loading into new areas in Tartarus could even reach 30 fps for a second, though my scuffed hardware is getting a little outdated. Worst case turn reflections off, it'll do wonders.

(My Specs:
GPU: Quadro RTX 4000
CPU: I7-9750H
RAM: 64GBs)

---{ Will I rage quit? }---
Only if you aren't used to JRPGs. One of my friends wants desperately to get into Persona, but he absolutely hates the fighting on account of his lack of turn-based combat experience.

I played on Merciless (Highest difficulty of the five) and only struggled on one or two bosses. Once I was actually able to make a build, I was just curb stomping bosses.

---{ Must I grind? }---
It's a JRPG. If you don't like grinding, you're in the wrong genre.

---{ Will the story replace my life? }---
Absolutely. Persona games have incredible engaging and emotional stories, and even among those, Persona 3 is far superior. The dark emotional stories and characters are far more interesting than almost anything made nowadays.

If the other Persona games have 10/10 stories, Persona 3 has a 15/10.

---{ Will I have a wallet after getting this? }---
Weelllll... 70$ is quite a bit, and while it sucks that Sega is hoping on the inflation bandwagon, for this game I definitely think it's worth it. You can easily get 100+ hours out of it, which goes far beyond the 1$ = 1 hour rule.

---{ How buggy is it?}---
The only bug I have experienced (Aside from frame drops) was this one time I clipped inside a destructible object in Tartarus. All I had to do was break it and I was free though, so no harm done.

I finished this game today at 8 pm.

After waiting months for its release I am at a loss for words from the emotion i feel from finishing this game. Such beautiful themes spread throughout this game and such meaningful relationships you get to experience with every character. This game asks and answers the question of what is the purpose of ones life, and is death terrifying? Throughout this game you see the struggle the S.E.E.S has to experience, every member struggling with mental challenges and grief. But throughout all of this every member has good in them, the idea of death is inevitable what matters is what you do during your finite time in this world. This is what connected me to this game. It's themes are so beautiful and perfectly crafted, No matter how awful the next day may seem there's something you can look forward to and fight for. You'll know exactly what I am hinting towards by the end of the game. If I could I would remove all my memory of this game and play infinitely for my first time, and even if I can't do that I an grateful I got to experience this game in its beautiful state.

now its the entry i started with way back, so ima tad biased. my literal one compliant is they didnt make a certain boss fight have that otherworldly voice effect while changing phases. the original final boss fight was so impactful that i simply expect it to sound like kylo ren. but besides missing that delivery specifically almost every other voice acted thing in this game is a straight upgrade; i had to get used to akihikos new voice- but i did fast. the performances for what was voiced before are fantastic- but its all the new voice work too; all 10 phases of a social link are fully voiced. ( provided they speak )

they also added a social link lite for the party members not under the arcana; and theyre so natural they fit in with the fes stuff seemlessly. also as i played i wanted to see if two optional side quests were in and i believe both are in (you can save two doomed souls provided these hidden objectives are accomplished) however i knew how to trigger only one of em i did see the mcguffin for the earlier one while triggering the latter.

this remake is a reward. and completing the game just recently with like 45/48 achievements in one go should tell ya its a welcome shift. i still dont think the og persona 3 was all that hard- and this is easier, but the changes arent dumbed down theyre just easier by accident of being fulfilling choices. the baton pass in p3 combat feeds into the loop nicely. the Monad doors were also great challenges and they push you to enter them because they deactivate if you move on without taking them. a nice lil risk/reward, very much a persona 3 typa choice. some challenges like bosses can be retried straight away a nice way not to overkill the punishment youre getting. but i do remember once messing up massively against a regular enemy and i had to reload on that death- it was like the only death i lost anything in. it doesnt feel like being babied though it just skips a whole reload which is nice considering the bosses are some of the highlights of the games feel. so getting right back in there has a very positive relationship with the theme of the game.

i spoke too long- persona 3 is better than most jrpgs even in its own series- this is a straight upgrade of that wonderful game- and for once players dont have to negotiate positive changes with some dungeon and extra waifus.

This is my first game from the Persona series and I can safely say that it [b] Blew. Me. Away. [/b] I don't even know where to start. Although this is my first game of the Persona series , I know a lot of the spoilers from the original games and experiences from megaten because I had an interest in them which influenced me to buy this as my first Persona game on Steam thus making me feel like this is a really faithful remake outside of a few additional contents that I would list in the end. 

[h3]What is Persona 3 Reload? [/h3]
In the world of Persona 3 Reload , there is a time that only happens when the clock strikes exactly at 00:00, that time is referred to as the ‚ÄúDark Hour‚Äù. Humans are turned into coffins and they are unable to remember everything that happened during this time and the school you just transferred to will be twist into a very tall tower called ‚ÄúTartarus‚Äù . During ‚ÄúDark Hour‚Äù , ‚ÄúShadows‚Äù roam about. People that retain their human forms during ‚ÄúDark Hour‚Äù are referred to as ‚ÄúPersona Users‚Äù , this includes you and your team members. After awakening to your persona powers , you were recruited into S.E.E.S (Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad) and together with other S.E.E.S. members , you are tasked to find out the truth of the cause of ‚ÄúDark Hour‚Äù , ‚ÄúShadows‚Äù and ‚ÄúTartarus‚Äù while juggling your school life.


[u] Social Links [/u]
Social links are a casts of characters introduced in the game. To someone that has never played a Persona game , social links are basically stories of specific characters. As you interact with each character more , your bond deepens and you learn more about their life , motivations , struggles etc. Each character is tied to one of the major arcanas of tarot cards, interacting with these characters will further your progression of said ‚Äúarcana‚Äù and each major character only has 1 arcana per character. The cast of characters in this game is faithful to the original games with some great additions like [spoiler] Aeon arcana [/spoiler] that were available only in specific versions of the older versions of Persona 3. You can feel the writers pour their hearts out writing a story for each character. Each character is uniquely designed and each has stories as good as their design. There are a few that missed the mark , an example would be the [spoiler][b] Moon arcana [/b][/spoiler] where although faithful to the original script , should‚Äôve been in my honest opinion , changed . Another thing to note , all social links are now fully voiced , which is a HUGE plus for immersion. These arcanas are also meaningful to progression , maxing an arcana unlocks a specific item that lets you fuse a specific persona. 

[u] Music [/u]
I have absolutely nothing but praises for this category. Every track in the OST is an [b]ABSOLUTE BANGER [/b] . The decision to bring back Lotus Juice, the main rapper from the original OST back into this game was just the best decision they have ever made. Changing the main female vocalist to Azumi Takahashi from Yumi Kawamura , the original‚Äôs female vocalist , was also a ballsy move for a remake but that decision only elevated the music in the game. Note that most songs are mixed based on the original game's music but with a modern twist. 

[u] Main cast [/u]
Without going into spoiler territory , the main casts of characters , like social links , were elevated in this remake. ATLUS has opt to change all voices for the main casts (I am playing the English dub) with the original voice casts as other characters in the game . This decision to change the voices in my honest opinion was perfect. Even with new casts , the main casts' voices were not out of place and in fact raised the bar for what I expect from a game with voice acting. 

[u] Gameplay [/u]
To keep things short , there are 3 elements for gameplay 

[b] Turn based RPG [/b]
The persona series (after the original persona 3's release) is famous for it's ""One More!"" and ""All out Attack""s. These mechanics incentivise players to exploit enemy weakness and team building, If you hit a weakness , you get one more turn. If a weakness is hit , the enemy will get knocked down. If the enemy is knocked down , you get to initiate an ""All out attack!"". The gameplay loop is essentially these and it is goddamn satisfying. This is not factoring the absolute eye-candy of a UI for the battle screen or menu screen that makes the transition of menu-ing extremely satisfying. Who can forget about the music , the popular opinion is to hate the newly mixed version of ""Mass Destruction"" but I think it isn't that bad as people think, as for the new track made for player side advantage , ""It's Going Down Now!"" , let's just say it has been playing in my head since the ever first trailer they showcased this song till now which is playing while I am writing this review.

[b] Personas [/b]
To explain to someone that has never played a persona game what personas are is a bit tricky. I would say that they are ""stat sticks"" , you equip personas to inherit thier stats , weakness and skills. Persona's are mainly based on myths and legends with most designs made by Kazuma Kaneko very long time ago for ATLUS's other games like Shin Megami Tensei. The gameplay loop for this section is that , the longer you play , the more personas you will unlock , each persona is unique , design , weaknesses and skills. There are 2 ways to get personas , one is to get them as a reward from the victory screen , the other is by fusing 2 different personas to create a different personas , this lets you choose what skills you want to inherit into the newly fused persona , making everyone's progression different as the chances of someone else creating an exact same skill set persona are small albeit not impossible.

[b] Time management[/b]
Persona games are famous for it's ""Calender"" system. You get limited time slots per day to do what you want. Usage of a time slot can be spending time with a character to deepen a bond, or work part-time at a cafe , grind EXP , pray at the shrine , and many more. There are also unique days where there are special events to stop making the system stale. Note that climbing ‚ÄúTartarus‚Äù consumes one of these time slots are practically mandatory to climb a specific amount of floors per month to actually progress in the story. 


[u]Cons[/u]
Although I mentioned that this was a faithful remake , the decision to not include Female main character and The Answer DLC together with the game when I paid full price for this game is a bit absurd. This is turning a blind eye to the useless day 1 DLCs ATLUS has been practicing for years. Another reason I think will make people shy away from this game is how repetitive climbing ‚ÄúTartarus‚Äù is (this was alleviated for me because of how good the music for battles were but I can‚Äôt say this for everybody) . Last but not least , the team members you get to use are not all built equal , there is technically a clear line on who is ‚Äúgood‚Äù and who is ‚Äúmediocre‚Äù , in the end this is still a single player game so just who you want. 

[u]Conclusion[/u]
Like I mention , this is my first game from the Persona series and this is how I viewed the game and would explain to someone that is interested in purchasing the game. I would admit I skimped pass a lot details but I think my review has provided enough context for what the game provides and how the gameplay works for people that has never touched a persona game. I appreciate any criticism provided and will edit the review if needed. Thank you for reading.

No ""The Answer""

That's about it . . . this game has everything in everyone other way. Unlike previous titles, almost every piece of dialogue with important characters (Social Links & Party Members) are fully voice acted. Never have I been so emotionally connected with fictional characters until I started playing this game.

I would regard this as a challenging game, especially with many of the changes from the original; but P3R has always kept me on my toes.

There's a bit of lag in certain areas of the game but that's because of the reflections on the floor; just turn it off in settings and the game runs very smoothly.

I remember playing this back in the PS2 FES days and it hooked me into the SMT series pretty quickly. However, being semi-new to JRPGs the difficulty seemed so much higher back then (in the days where you MUST HIT WITH THEIR WEAKNESS EVERY BATTLE and run out of SP after like 3 floors, imagine my fun when I played my first mainline SMT game lol). I honestly would suggest anyone who liked P4G/P5R to pick this up (and just so you know how much love they gave to this remaster, do a comparison and watch a clip or two from a let's play of the original/FES).

The ""new"" mechanics (really nothing new, so much as borrowed from P5R or updated from the original with QoL in mind) are welcome. I could never really sink hours into P3FES like I already have with this remaster, and that's thanks to the game feeling like P3 but playing like almost a new entry in the series. The beautiful visuals (the tower looks like a completely new location), seeing Elizabeth while listening to the beautiful Velvet room soundtrack, everything makes this a much more welcome addition to the Persona series (especially after Tactica, no hate, was just let down a bit with that one) and I could see veterans of the series loving this as much as new-comers.",1708038088,1708038088,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

I enjoyed P4, absolutely love P5 on how they perfect the gameplay. So the moment P3R was announced, I immediately bought Premium Edition and have been grinding it ever since. (Sought after Collector's Edition but sold out way too fast)

The tediousness is still there, but it has been improved with some of gameplay changes in P5, it feels better on how to progress now, everyone has an ultimate ability with F\_/uka becomes an extremely OP navigator. The Sim schedule during daytime is still stacked, but there are some adjustments and enhances that allow you to utilize the night time more, making it less daunting, unlike the previous 3.

Overall, I like that they stay faithful to the original (90%) while adding some changes (~10%) that actually make the game better to progress and allow more depth into each characters even more.

P3R, by far, has the best plot and character development for me, the more serious tone is also my liking more than P4 & P5.

A solid remake full of Quality of Life changes and a bunch of upgrades to graphics and lighting. Runs well on Steam Deck with 60FPS with no reflections, low shadow quality and 100% render scale, but even with these settings, it still looks good with a bit of fps dropping on Tartarus. On PC its a buttery smooth 120fps with no frame drops with 2-3 rare instances of crashing during my 100+ hours playthrough. Persona 3 Reload is one of the best JRPGs released this year. Like any other Persona game, you can expect a great cast, a good story, great music, a simplistic but excellent turn-based battle system, and a year in a Japanese Student's life (romance option included). Also forgot to mention the animations... they're so damn good.

I have played the first hour of the game, despite me wanting to boycot this game knowing that this is NOT a definitive edition. But since I owe the makers of P3 a lot, I decided to give it a go, regardless.

First things first, the presentation. The graphics are a massive upgrade, no one can deny that. But The way the beginning is handled, its mystique is a downgrade. Two scenes come into mind: The man listening to a radio being trapped in the dark hour and Thanatos' Awekening. Both scenes do their job, but incredibly poorly. Both scenes lack their graphic nature to set the tone. You are supposed to be confused and feel a little tension when these scenes pop up. For crying out loud, P3P had limitations and they at least made custom portraits for the first Shadow-Victim.
""Thats just the beginning, the rest is stellar"" - I sure hope so! But if they can't handle the beginning how can I be sure this game is worth its money?

My second point I can not stand: Sound. 
I had several moments where I felt I wasn't hearing right. I know the old tracks. I know them WELL. When I enter the dorm, I want clear trumpets and beats, a real welcoming fanfare. Why on earthg is EVERYTHING I heard up to now so flat?
The track that plays, when the first big shadow attacks, you know the spooky one that should make your heart pump and skin crawl? I barely heard anything stick out. Not the beats, not the loud piano at the beginning, its all flat.
I actually got my headphones because I felt I was missing a whole track in the song.

Why does every song sound like Atlus' neighbours were complaining about noise and everything got quiet to not stir trouble?

The voice cast is different, but great. Whenever I heard a new voice I said ""Hey thats fitting, I can live with that""
Except for Ikutsuki. This man is hollow in this game. No joy to be heard when he tells his stupid jokes. And thats not critique towards the actor, its easy to just make a playful voice. The direction is at fault here. I wanna refund, I am sure the P-Studio put a lot of work in there, but man, just put it into P6 isntead of milking fans.

I'll come back when the game costs 30‚Ç¨, thats what the first P3 at launch was priced at! ;)

TLDR:
- Its not a definitive Version, no FeMC (Thats on me doe, still, I want to mention it)
- some out of tone changes to the presentation (2 scenes handled very lightly when they should have had impact)
- music is flat all the way (Either my ears are bad or there really arent Highs and Lows in there...)
- some voice-roles are misdirected",1708006918,1708006918,False,4,1,0.409836083650588989,2,True,False,False

What's good:
-Music
-combat
-story

What could be improved
-the ability to save anytime, cut scenes included.
-less skipping time you might want to use
-more customization as a main character  (I mean this kind of became a requirement for role playing avatars years ago)
-storyline path writing  (this story was good, but in lots of places you lack agency or only have two options so the story lacks the kind of agency you should feel.  So I constantly am reminded I'm the character you wrote, not taking any of the aspects of the personas I should be conveying as myself.  Like you start with six and progress to many more.  But in real life you would seamlessly switch from one to the other in conversation.  At first you might sound like a fool, but you might talk like you are in charge to convince someone of your leadership.  You could even switch to a more of a lover, flirting your way to try and convince them to get what you want.  This kind of writing tree implementation would be hard to do, but really cool to play in.  Giving the illusion you could immerse in the universe in a much deeper level.  It would also be used to write like soft requirements for opening the story.  Like you require 5 death persona to take this path, or 3 sun.  Leading to like a way bigger game, but one with more story tree options.  Also you may want to consider writing an ending for each of the Tarrot so that the game has more replay value... any way this was my desire for the writing since Perona 1.  I wanted my personas to hold real life weight in the story.  I wanted to see an ending for each card type.  I also wanted to be able to craft my own story in the universe or one that felt like it.

I really loved these games, and I look forward to any releases and or future games in the series.  Hopefully you guys love it enough to keep these stories and world being developed.  And i hope you grow into something even more captivating, fun and engaging.

If you want a comparison if you take P4G and P5R Merciless the enemy just get bigger hp pool and hit harder compare to P3R there just not only hit harder but also hit your/ party member weakness and most likely to attack with Ailment like charm,pulinpa, distress etc. to make the fight more annoying. I welcome the challenge I know it not for everyone but for veteran player I highly recommended. Just a side note if you planning to start NG+ on Merciless don't bother because the game only let's you carry your outfit and playtime only so basically like you start playing new game.",1707980913,1707980913,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm new to the story of Persona 3, and I was worried it was going to be extremely slow and repetitive, but luckily that ended up changing after pushing through the first introductory bit of the story, and started having me on the edge of my seat ever since.]
Tartarus can be a bit hit or miss when it comes to the excitement factor - but if you wanna just have a hyper-fixation on an enjoyable battle system, it definitely does apply.

In my case, I have purchased the ""Premium Edition"" which at the time of launch was $99 - I decided to not use the overpowered personas that were immediately available because I wanted some form of challenge on my first playthough of the game - but it was refereshing to see series favorites show up again here (and even be made from non-DLC characters).

I look forward to beating this game and coming back with the overpowered personas and having a field day in tartarus while I try different clubs / relationships on my next playthrough.

The voice acting is really good (but this is coming from someone who is not used to the old cast).  They did borrow heavily from the feel of Persona 5 Royal - and that is not as bad of a thing as some angry reviewers have been crying about.  Atlus did an amazing job adjusting the look and feel of the modern UI to fit with the darker themes that P3R offers.  The seamless transitions pared with the easy-to-follow social link system is a major upgrade from what was offered in the original (which I've seen/heard bits and pieces of).

I do wish they did more with this remaster by making the story a bit faster to catch on - but I completely understand why they wanted to keep it the same for the purists and people who grew up with this game.  This is not Persona 5 slapped on to a beloved franchise.  This is a completely original art direction that has made this game the best version that it could be (with hopefully a female protagonist being released in future DLC)

Overall, I 100% recommend this game - and I do wish to say you don't need to buy the most expensive version to get a good experience.  The base game is pleanty for those who want to dive into a new world by a beloved video game publisher.

Of course this is very disengaging and just turns the game into a bad visual novel with random decently polished megaten combat thrown in every month.
I still recommend doing it if shadow combat is getting old for you, as it always does, because shadows have no personality and there is no way to interact with them, just badly designed enemies overall and it sucks they reuse so many of them. 

I specifically said that the combat is decently polished because shifting (baton pass) is broken, and so is theurgy (magatsuhi skills) you can always just avoid using them if you don't like it, but it's still something that should be critiqued.

Anyway, I recommend this game still, but only for beginners to JRPGs and anime fans. While persona fans love to claim it's dark and deep it still has all the anime stuff like an hour long beach segment where you are forced to hit on girls, a wit studio animated shower scene of a teenage girl, and a hot spring scene where the genders get mixed up. It doesn't matter if you put death, self harm and suicide in this game because it's still persona and it's incredibly cheesy. Nothing can make me take [spoiler]The gang getting crucified and watching Mitsuru's dad get shot[/spoiler] seriously, some of these scenes are just terribly executed and goofy, and it's only amplified by the voice acting.
The only good scene is when the teacher finds out you have been edating each other, it's so bad it's funny and the (JP) dub of it has severe contrast to the rest of the game being all serious anime mode. No, I'm not spoiler tagging that, you deserve to have it spoiled it's so bad.

Now I get that music is subjective and all, but this OST has been downgraded from bad to baddddd. The remixes just sound weak and it's odd that they decided to keep the midi horns. The main vocalist went from exaggerated vocals to baby's first vocals, sure it has better English pronunciation but it has just lost a bunch of energy. And Lotus Juice is still maybe the worst rapper ever, he could definitely spit some so called ""bars"" if a sentient human being wrote the songs, but he is out here rhyming biz with biz so there is no hope. 

So it's a high quality remake that makes the worst game I have ever played tolerable. It's probably up there with persona 5 in the hall of mid JRPGs, and it definitely surpasses P5 because it's from before they started doing that stupid mascot thing. Jack Frost will always be the true mascot and Morgana and Teddy should stay on e621 where they belong. 
If you haven't played many JRPGs, enjoy anime and/or are 15 years old, try it out! If you are normal, emulate the original first to see if you are interested in the story or themes, because games are stupid expensive and the steam refund time limit is not well fit for RPGs!!!

It's funny how people complain about the tartarus grind and they made it arguably grindier with the addition of Twilight Fragments which are bad yet i'm sure no one will talk about that or the fact that the game play is now braindead and just wasting your time.

The healing clock is now locked behind Edward Cullen's magic meme dust instead of the ever abundant Yen which is ironic considering the price of this game. That adds to the grind. 

Treasure chests with anything worth a damn in them also require Twilight Fragments which means you will often miss out on loot or come back later to grab a now powercrept and useless item all because they wanted to superficially improve the game by adding mechanics from P5 which sold well. This is frustrating because you can infer from it that they are out of touch and and don't listen to fans at all.

Who the hell wanted locked chests? That worked in P5 thematically but is forced here.

um already played through persona 3 fes and portable btw and I'm biased since p3 characters are my favorite but I do think the $70 is kinda worth it.
social links are all voice acted all the way through (except for sunday hangouts), extra scenes with sees gang, some p5 stuff features added back in, English VA is kinda cute since it has the old voice actors kinda chilling as minor characters so they are still in the game if you're so stingy

-
Massive L is that there is no yumi kawamura as the lead female singer. New lady sounds kinda similar to P5's singer to me, sounds interesting and all but as a biased fes gamer it kinda makes me feel a lil sad rip 

having a really great time playing the game so far despite already knowing the plot and all, adds enough stuff for it to be worth playing through the p3 story again",1707958614,1707958614,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Persona 3 has a special place in my heart since its my first entry into the persona games and an introduction to Shin Megami Tensei series.  

The story base is still the same but the ‚Äúaddition‚Äù is what makes me blown away. There's a lot of character interaction between your party member outside social link, link episodes and even some extra scene you dont see in the original. On top of that, a fully voiced social link! Also more strega screentime. A big improvement towards Tartarus is absolutely gorgeous now that it looks different and every block gives you a noticeable changes and  different feels between one another.  

Atlus really step up their game in by making alot of QOL towards the gameplay , combat feels smooth, animation is clean, and the best part  is the Soundtrack. There is a time where i just put my controller down and vibe to ‚ÄúColor Your Night‚Äù all night long.

- Graphics and visuals are good and detailed. The cutscenes are remade with more detail and amplified from the original version. Hence the overall story re-experience is great.
- Some convos (possible spoilers) with the antagonists which deepends the lore of the enemies are added.
- The dungeons are remade to make items more accessible (I'm talking about the golden hands, the twilight fragments, and breakable objects). The Monad dungeon is also simplified.

Cons:
- Unfortunately, this is coming from someone who played SMT Nocturne and other Persona games: the combat is pretty darn easier than Persona 5. The existence of theurgy and shift mechanics made the fight way easier.
- The dialogue mechanics are bad that you have to press auto button for every cutscene change.
- The rush mode is not really rush mode. It does not make the whole fight faster.

I dont know where to place:
- There are some music that you can really jive and vibe into especially the back ground music. But the boss fight and the ending song (true ending) sound better in the original.
- The boss fights have attack patterns (i.e. scripted). I gave this a plus especially if you have played the older versions, that the usual strats for some bosses cannot be applied to the remake. But, this is evened out by the Theurgy + Shift mechanics which made the fight significantly not only doable but way easier.

Overall, regardless whether you have played the original Persona 3 (or the Portable version last year) or not, I recommend this game overall. Especially if this will be your first Persona game, it is a good entry to the gateway of all Persona series. But not quite for Shin Megami Tensei series (I am talking about the main SMT) since that series is way more punishing than the Persona games.",1707926364,1707957334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I liked my time with P4G and P5R as well, but I think I actually like the flow of this game more as it gets you into the action quicker and it feels like I have more control on how the story plays out. Granted this is a result of a lesser focus on the characters and story so if that is more your thing, this might be a bit disappointing for you.

I never played The Answer in P3FES but I don't know that I would miss it all that much. If it comes later as DLC that would be fine with me. I am more bummed about the lack of the female protagonist from P3P. Yes they fleshed out the social links a lot more for this version, but some people would still really prefer to have a gender option and it seems like a big missed opportunity.

My biggest gripe would be that they are charging the new AAA standard price of $70 which I honestly don't think this game does enough to justify. The skeleton of the game is the same as it has been since the PS2 days but with updated graphics and QOL updates, and even those are based on P5R which isn't exactly new.

Weaker cutscenes. I get that in some ways they injected more of the canon personality of the mc and as such some scenes needed to be changed. But the generally weaker Storyboarding and sound design does reduce the emotional impact.

Akihiko was debuffed. Especially considering his character, it hurts the story and what he stands for. 

End game wasn‚Äôt balanced around the skills you can get towards the end, rendering the final battles as weak. Which sucks, cuz the final battle especially was powerful in the OG. Reaper also was less threatening.

Alecks Le‚Äôs VA work on the scarf guy was a bit of a disappointment. The environment lighting in places like the dorm and top of Tartarus aren‚Äôt that good. The NPC models are such a noticeable decrease in quality that it becomes distracting.

On the plus side, the new voices fit pretty well. Some more than others, and some being an improvement over the OG. The SL‚Äôs being fully voiced adds even more to the game.

You need to wait like half a second before you confirm your commands as you go through dialogue boxes and combat, and it gets in the way a lot. The actual visuals in the menu backgrounds are ok, but literally every screen in this game looks so busy because the MC is popping some sadboy anime pose every chance he gets. It was cool for the rebel thing in 5, but I think 3 should have been more subdued. I love P3 and the sadboy MC, but the menus are a little ridiculous this time. With that said, the S. Link menu is the exception; that menu is simple but mad stylish, and it works perfectly.

The Velvet Room menu however is maybe one of the worst menu layouts I have ever seen. Atlus is very clearly starting to elevate form over function. I actually tilted my head to read the tiles the first time I went into the fusion menu. That is ridiculous, and I have no idea how anyone thought that menu was ok to put in a videogame.

$70 for what I've seen so far is cutting it kind of close, and that comes from an Atlus maniac that swallowed the EO collection price without question.

""c'est magnifique"", as they say

i've never really been an RPG person, but i'm a Persona fan since 2019, though unfortunately i wasn't able to finish my playthrough of Persona 3 Portable back then due to loss of motivation from a corrupted save file at the end of the game. but it felt absolutely amazing to re-experience this story with Reload, i have never cried over a game so much before! and i'm not ashamed to say this is probably my new favorite game, period

I‚Äôd particularly like to highlight the retroactive addition of [i]Skill Cards[/i] and selectable skills during [i]Fusion[/i], making experimenting with [i]Persona[/i] builds far more accessible, and actually fun, as opposed to the mind-numbing roulette spin that was [i]Skill Inheritance[/i] in the original.

One of my main gripes with the original [i]Persona 3[/i] was its inconsistent combat difficulty. Even on normal, [i]Tartarus[/i] bosses could be ridiculously challenging, while [i]Full Moon[/i] bosses were an absolute cakewalk. That‚Äôs why I was so pleasantly surprised to see the immense amount of effort put into rebalancing these encounters. [i]Tartarus[/i] bosses aren‚Äôt pushovers by any means, but, fittingly, feel more like mini bosses, while significant story bosses are now far more challenging. 

[i]Tartarus[/i] as a whole has been more fleshed out. Ideas from the original, such as [i]Monad,[/i] have been reworked to fit the experience more organically, and the [i]Arcana Burst[/i] mechanic keeps each run a little different. I also can‚Äôt neglect to mention the fantastic visual re-design of [i]Tartarus[/i], which really goes above and beyond.

As a whole, combat encounters are easier, but not because they‚Äôve been dumbed down, but rather because you‚Äôre spending much less time fighting the game‚Äôs mechanics, as was sometimes the case in the original. With welcome additions from newer [i]Persona[/i] titles, changes to ailments and KOs, as well new [i]Theurgy[/i] abilities, combat is more enjoyable, while keeping you on your toes when it wants to. 

Overall, [i]Persona 3 Reload[/i] is a deeply faithful remake that expands on what is, in my opinion, one of the greatest games of all time. With a phenomenal soundtrack, a fun and addictive gameplay loop, and a timeless story that never fails to reduce me to tears, if you‚Äôve been holding off on giving the game a go, there‚Äôs no better time than now.

Persona 3 Reload combines gameplay additions from both Persona 3 FES and Portable, with added QoL features from Persona 5. Tartarus also gets a massive makeover with new gimmicks and extra challenges. While the game is still fairly easy, Atlus finally gets the difficulty setting right in a Persona game.

It's still Persona 3 at its core, a game from 2006. Some parts of the game particularly the social link and available activities does show its age compared to its more recent successors. However, Reload added extra scenes and link episodes that do much more than just flesh the parts of the story that I initially found lacking. The game is almost entirely voice acted too, which certainly helps a lot in its presentation. While some of the new voice cast can take some time to get used to (Yukari and Akihiko in particular), I ended up liking them over the course of my playtime.

I still think Persona 5 Royal flows better as a whole in terms of pacing, social links, and free time activities. But with all the new things Persona 3 Reload adds, it definitely takes over it as my new favourite in terms of combat and presentation.",1707912645,1707912790,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all and obviously one of the main parts is the graphics upgrade I thought that fes had fine graphics for a ps2 game but this game blows that and Persona 5 graphics out of the water, very detailed and very cool visuals to look at while exploring Iwatodai and Tartarus. The next change is Link Episodes which can occur after hitting certain parts of the story I appreciate them for fleshing out great characters even more. Tartarus also had some major changes that make it more fun to play through then the original and combat is fluid and fun. Tartarus is still a bit grindy and sometimes can be a little annoying at times but it is miles better than Fes' tartarus. In conclusion this game is very faithful to the original with some added changes that makes this my definitive way to play Persona 3 now.",1707887111,1707887111,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Negatives: The grind if you're finishing a Block of Tartarus in 1 day like I was can be... annoying.

dari segi story overall sama, cuman buanyak event2 tambahan sama anggota S.E.E.S yang dulue gaada, jadi aku bisa lebih mengerti background masing2 character dan ber-empati sama beberapa character yang dulue ga seberapa di ceritain
gameplay banyak tambahan, Tartarus sekarang fun poll, Quality of Life yang ditambahin di game ini bikin player ngerasa ga kerepotan sama beberapa hal dari game sebelumnya yang sebenere ga perlu, cuman ada beberapa addition yang menurutku jadi membuat game ini jadi mudah poll jadi untuk segi challenge tak rasa difficulty dibawah nya Hard ini kegampangen
Musik dan visual e bener2 uindah rek, asli nyenengno banget maine jadi menikmati, lague diputer sak uwen2 yo ga kiro bosen, trus ketambahan tiap character saiki onok voice e ben ngomong, jadi kita bisa lebih merasakan emosi character waktu ngomong

The Answer from P3FES and the secondary protagonist from P3P are missing, but many additions and changes from these versions are included in this remake. This game runs well and I had not experienced any major technical issues in my playthrough. The only problems I had with the game were that I found the game to be a little bit repetitive and boring at points, but I would chalk that up to the fact I recently played the original in anticipation for this remake.

Edit: This is post completion of the game.

After finishing the game, i have only one thing to say, wow.

The music, the cutscenes, the social links, the combat, the graphics, everything 
all look so amazing and beautiful, i loved every minute of spending time with the social links, each and every one of them were fulfilling. And it never even felt grindy with the levels, i fought most enemies i saw and i was always either on level or above level for the bosses and never had to go back and get more levels to feel equipped to take on bosses

I never got to play the original Persona 3, but boy am i glad to have played this one, i always heard about it being that kind of somber and dark persona game with those guns, and now i finally got the chance to play it, and im glad i got to play this version.

the only negative thing id have to say about the game is the enemies feel a bit repetitive but besides that, it feels like a masterpiece in its own right. 

If youve never played Persona 3 and youre reading this review, i absolutely recommend playing it its enjoyable every step of the way. If you played the original, honestly? I still recommend it its an amazing game",1707548165,1707863795,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm bummed that apparently both FEMC and TA are missing from this, but hopefully they come back at some point.
anyways P3 is fucking great and I love everything about it, and so far it's a faithful 1-1 recreation with music and VA changes.
Edit after finishing the game:
P3R is defo the easiest persona game in the series now, which is kinda dissapointing. I went through on hard, which when i played the original P3 it kicked my ass. Besides that, it's still fun,
The ending and all the major story beats still had me with tears in my eyes. I didn't cry this time around, but it was hard not to. P3 is a story worth experiencing, like a good book. Even if it's still a JRPG esc story. I'll be rounding up the last few achievements and then letting it hang out until i want to experience it again in the future. I may not agree Atlus making it 70$ but whatever.

As a total tie down, P3R is worth the price in gold. I hope they'll add the FEMC route, due to the nature of how the FEMC tells the story in a different light when you take everything into account. We're supposed to be getting ""Episode Aegis"" AKA ""The Answer"" from P3. Atlus has a chance to rewrite one of their most poorly recieved pieces of content ever. Let's hope they can nail it.

I won't recommend this when Persona 3 Portable exists on steam and in my opinion offers better story content.
Yes the graphics in Reload might be a huge improvement to Persona 3 and Persona 3 Portable but considering it is basically the same visuals as Persona 5 Royal, they could have made a bigger effort to improve the game-play.

Thank you, ATLUS, for reminding me of one of my most memorable gaming journeys in such a beautifully updated form. I appreciate and cherish all the little new additions and changes that round out the narrative and the gaming experience; I especially love all the little new SEES member interaction events that feel like a whole new social link and allows the group to feel more like a community of comrades who slowly grow into friends. I adore all the voice acting. Playing Persona 3 again allowed me to remember the major reasons and motivations behind my own creative endeavours, and I am sure the memories of Persona 3 Reload will be important to my future creative output.

The Final Boss fight felt a bit easier to me, but the optional Super boss is still irritatingly hard AF due to the rules enforced upon you. (Solo ONLY, No Drain skills, Null Skills, Reflect Skills, No -Karn spells, No usage of passive counters, and you can't use Armageddon too early). 

Overall though, the game definitely feels a lot more easier than the original PS2 release due to the absence of the fatigue system and having full party controls.

Character wise, in SEES, some characters were slightly toned down and some others definitely benefited from having better voice actors (Yamagishi especially).  
A new feature in-game called Link Episodes added some cool backstory and insight into the party members without S Links. 
 
For the S links, it was pretty much 50-50. I didn't think much about the Strength S Link when I played FES way back then, but the voice actress made her 10x better than what it should be. Hopefully fully voiced S Links is a series standard going into P6 because it really adds an extra layer of character. Sun, Hanged, Temperance, and Tower were good. Magician and moon I skipped through the dialog cause I truly did not care. Devil I felt like was just there to fill time at night (I felt this way before in the original).

In typical Atlus fashion, this game features really good new songs, some meh remixes in there as well but overall the sound track is very good. Atsushi Kitajoh is definitely good at making lyrical songs but his weakness lies in his mixing of instrumentals and guitar tracks. They sound flat and lack punch compared to Atlus' Toshiki Konishi and former composer Shoji Meguro. 

Art Style is on point, new artist was appointed in charge for the game but she still managed to capture and improve the essence of the original. Art in the UI in particular is immaculate. Usage of 3D models with 2D art on the menu interface is a really nice touch. 

if only they could channel just a little bit of that passion into improving the games assets, textures, lighting and overall appearance. I believe they could get an even larger audience. At the end of the day, a good looking game will always encourage more people to try regardless of how you feel about graphics. The same way Tales made that graphical leap from Tales of Berseria -> Tales of Arise. Atlus, you have the budget to do this, this is the 2nd game you have made using UE4. From SMTV -> Persona 3 Reload. Some game design choices seem weird. Like having no Ambient Occlusion makes the game look very off in the brighter enviments. It looks great in night sections of the game which is why the difference is really noticeable. The beach setting made it more apparent. The walking and running animations (in cutscenes) seem very rigid and Janky. It's nitpicky, but It's these little things that Atlus keep getting away with that irk me a lot. Hopefully with the UE4 expierience they can deliver with P6.  

Overall, the game itself is very fun and I can definitely recommend this game to any JRPG fan. Story wise, the strongest out of the modern persona games. The $70 price point might turn off many players that wish to get into the series but that is up for the consumer to decide.

the order i played the series in was 5-4-3 (completely backwards lol) and while the gameplay was annoying at times because you could not control your party members It is still perfectly playable still today. I also 

Absolutely breathtaking. I don't have many games where my day revolves around getting home to play more especially for a game whose story I am already familiar with; but somehow if i wasn't inherently thinking about the game itself I was humming ""Memories of You"" or the new opening ""Full Moon Full Life"" as i was going about my day. Characters I never really used in the original were given really nice overhauls (they did my boy Ken Justice). 
I bawled like a child at the ending and at a few key points throughout the game, and i wouldn't have it any other way.

I'm gonna let my personal opinion stew so as recency bias doesn't cloud my judgement in saying this is the best Persona game. But I will say with all the thought provoking ideals and themes this game presents and how smooth the gameplay ends up being it will be really hard to go back and play 4/5 with the same mentality as before. Just know you are getting a quality game that was worth every damn penny and be sure to take your time playing/enjoying it.

TL/DR
The definitive way to play Persona 3. Not only a fantastic game, but also a wonderful experience.
Music is 10/10 but that's a given honestly.

I wasn't).

I think the best way for me to recommend Persona 3 Reload is to discuss what I disliked about P5R (having revisited it) because the two are very similar in a lot of ways. [b]The following will have thematic and story spoilers over Persona 5 Royal. I will just say that Persona 3, 4, and 5 are all wonderful games if you've never played them before. I'm speaking more to the experienced and perhaps tired Persona fan who's been dulled by the mechanics of these games but hasn't tried P3 out yet and is looking for an interesting story.[/b]



















To me, P5R's biggest weakness is its philosophical thinness. The majority of the game is like a college kid who talks about Marxism in a cool light because it's hip and ""modern"" and therefore correct.. without trying to ponder over why libertarianism exists in the first place. Scratch that, it IS exactly that, but set in a high school setting. The game mostly subscribes to the ""greed is bad"" view without looking at the positive outcomes of semi-corrupt governments and big companies today like Tesla (even though the people at the top might not be what you call ""ideal comrades""). 

To be fair to P5R, I enjoyed the last part against Maruki but was quite disappointed in the ""true ending"" rationale against Maruki's vision; the thieves basically just say ""I'm happy with this reality, so boohoo Maruki I'll do what I want, I don't care that it might cause suffering for lots of people"". I myself believe that a far more pragmatic argument against Maruki is the dilemma problem: if two people want mutually interfering outcomes, like say, there's a war between countries X and Y and I want X to win while the other person wants Y, then who decides what's the right choice in terms of making either of us happy? And if you then say that we could just avoid war altogether, then what about, say, nationalistic sentiments and imperialistic desires? Why should a person like Maruki then get to decide that a person's nationalistic / imperialistic sentiments are wrong? There are countless more examples like this on even simpler bases. It should be noted that since Maruki's power could eventually be arbitrary as per the game, he could arguably just become God and herald infinite unity across the world (but then this discussion turns meaningless; more productive would be the assumption that Maruki doesn't want to change people's wishes, which would be coherent with the last dungeon's ""testing room"" logic).

Persona 3 Reload, in contrast with what I just described, is a cogent and coherent piece that combines the stylistic elegance and modernity of P5R with a vivid depiction of the human struggle of death, of yin and yang. It is a wonderful story that, unlike P5R, mostly avoids platitudes and does not stretch its rhetoric to political infinity for the sake of sounding modern / politically correct. Additionally, P3R's ending is easily one of my favorites of any game I've played and will stick with me for a while, at the very least.

This is a game I can easily recommend to anyone who desires an intellectually stimulating story set in a mechanically and stylistically charming atmosphere, and not the other way around.",1707794180,1707794336,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Early review, will review more when done playing
- First of all, just want to thank Atlus for remastered and bring the original Persona 3 to modern platform and PC. Hope you guys will do the same for Persona 1 and 2 and more.
- Really love the art style and color tune (Red for Persona 5; Yellow for Persona 4; Blue sky color for Persona 3) even though I finished Persona 3 Portable that also came to PC before, still want to play Reload to see all the animations.
- The feature that I really glad that Reload have that after you gain stats, it shows you how much you currently got right after, so you don't need to open menu then go to stats later on.

Update: After sampling the soundtrack and the soundtrack DLC.
Persona 5 still have the best soundtrack
Then Persona 3

The new scenes with both SEES and even the few extra Strega scenes help elevate this from the original. Overall, I can say that P3 Reload is one of my favorite games ever.

The new cast for the EN dub do a good job at portraying the characters, though I ended up liking the Japanese voices more.

Tartarus is much more tolerable this time around, and I even found myself grinding out of my own volition, whereas in the original I only did it when necessary. The game definitely feels easier compared to the original even on the highest difficulty, especially with the addition of theurgy attacks. I always felt like I was cheating when using them, since you can pretty much kill everything within a couple turns if you know what you're doing. One of the better changes to the game for me was the removal of the fatigue system, it was really annoying to be forced to stop advancing because your teammates were tired. It also made leveling up Social Links harder since you had to do other things in order to feel better, which made you waste a lot of time. The schedule is also less tight in Reload, giving you more time to do S.Links and such.

From what I can tell the main story remains largely unchanged but there are little bits and pieces spread across the game that help with some of the pacing issues the previous iterations had. The introduction of ""Link Episodes"" for male party members, in lieu of Social Links, adds a refreshing layer to character development. There are now more things you can do in the dorm such as cooking, reading, and watching TV, providing passive combat abilities as rewards. 

The remastered songs have a mixed reception, but personally I find them good overall, with a few exceptions. The new songs are all among the best the series has to offer. I've seen people say this game feels more like Persona 5, but I don't really feel that way apart from the obvious graphical and gameplay advancements along with some QoL stuff. I think this remake really improved upon the original game in nearly every way possible and I would say this is the best way to experience the core P3. I don't mind the absence of The Answer, mostly because it was extremely tedious to play. If Atlus does add it as a dlc later on I hope they streamline it for a more enjoyable experience.",1707517589,1707787294,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Persona 3 is already good the story is incredibly gripping, the characters are incredible, the ending makes you cry, but Reload polishes a lot of jank from the base game, especially regarding the combat system, plus adds some quality of life that p4 and p5 introduced

Despite the game's outstanding music, compelling character development, and engrossing storytelling, its pricing strategy and lack of innovation leave much to be desired.

Price vs. Value:
The decision to price the game at $70 sets high expectations for quality and innovation‚Äîexpectations that, unfortunately, aren't fully met. This discrepancy raises concerns about the future direction of the series, echoing fears of a shift towards a quantity-over-quality model seen in other franchises like Assassins Creed or Call of Duty.

A Closer Look at My Concerns:
‚Ä¢	Innovation and Gameplay: The game's failure to introduce new mechanics or evolve its design philosophy is disheartening. The dungeon design, particularly Tartarus, remains as linear and repetitive as ever, lacking the thematic depth of Persona 4 Golden or the creative ambition of Persona 5. The level design falls far behind that of Persona 5, which pushed the series forward and attempted to get away from the linear repeat floor strategy that we saw throughout the earlier entries.
‚Ä¢	Visuals and Performance: The character models look incredible, but everything else is simply subpar for a $70 game. The 3D models of all the personas look like they still belong in the PlayStation 2 era. They reuse the same generic character assets during the story scenes. The maps for the battles, just look like simple level designs created in the unreal engine by an intern. For example, the train map, its just a big open space, with seats that don‚Äôt scale very well, and just barren emptiness. Like come on we should expect more from a $70 game.

          We still have loading screens and tiny instanced areas. For such simple level design in a game that released in the year 2024, Atlas needs to finally figure out how to reduce all this time loading. Its unbelievable and again feels like something from the PS2 era. Further, I have a 4080 and the latest I-9 processor as of 2023, yet my game feels so unoptimized and slows down sometimes when exiting menus or runs slower in the loading screens. This game should be smooth as butter for how simple it is, yet my experience feels like the same experience I had in gaming back in 2006.

Why This Matters:
The gaming community deserves transparency and fairness in pricing. Charging $70 for a game implies a certain level of quality and innovation, neither of which are adequately delivered here. This practice, if not addressed, risks diminishing the series' soul and identity, turning passionate fans into disillusioned critics.

Looking Forward:
My critique comes from a place of love and hope for the series. It's crucial for developers to listen to feedback and strive for excellence, especially when asking fans to invest more financially. I intend to 100% complete this game to get my money‚Äôs worth, but I am highly disappointed. The only other $70 games I‚Äôve played were Tears of the kingdom, and Tekken 8, which were absolutely worth the price as they innovated and propelled their respective series forward.",1707772170,1707772565,False,9,1,0.515503883361816406,0,True,False,False

What I liked the most was it's added story beats and refinements of systems taken from the future titles, such as Linked Episodes to flesh out the male party characters, more things to do during day/night time that makes it a bit more easier to do SL/Social Stat grinding, and the overall bump up in the combat mechanics to give a lot of fun options to just grind out encounters.

I didn't like that all the major SL didn't get that much of a touch up of the original, the lighting on the default settings not really making the game look that great in many areas (I recommend -5 or so in the brightness settings to better it a bit) and while all the new additions is nice, I actually do think it's still too much especially with the combat - it gives too much power to the player even on Merciless, and all the additions to spice up Tartarus kind of make it going back to just bloat with the additions and modifiers you can apply during that section of the game. I'm still ultimately of the opinion that Tartarus needs a block cut as I don't think all those floors are that justified to go through.

It's still absolutely a remake worth a playthrough, just maybe not worth it's full price tag.",1707753195,1707753195,False,3,0,0.488843798637390137,0,True,False,False

When I first heard it announced I must admit I figured it was going to be a lame cash grab, and was hesitant to buy at this price until I saw the overwhelmingly positive tag last several days - I could not have been more wrong about my hesitance.

I had P3F and P4 on ps2, but didn't really get into either very much but managed to get heavily into P4G on the vita which to this day is in the top 5 of my all-time favourite games. Returning to P3F/P3P and also trying P5 they didn't quite have the same draw for me as P4G between the characters and how the dungeons function.

This remake/remaster has implemented my favourite upgrades to the UI/combat from P5 and integrated them perfectly into a game whose story/characters/dungeon has managed to suck me in more than P5 could. Combined with an incredible face lift to the graphics and far more voice acted lines than I had expected, I'm absolutely blown away by the quality of this remake.

I believe that the characters in P4G blow these ones out of the water [at least of the characters I have met], and I still prefer how the dungeons in P4G work; so personally speaking I still prefer Persona 4 over this game [though, if it could one day get a remake treated with as much love as this, that would be my GOTY with no questions asked] however this version of P3 has sucked me in way more than any prior version and allowed me to actually experience this excellent game.",1707747239,1707747239,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I played Persona 3 FES about maybe 3 or 4 years ago and since then this has been the most impactful and beautiful piece of media I've ever had the pleasure to experience. The characters, the music, and the signature SMT-like gameplay mesh together so perfectly. This remake manages to improve upon every feature the original had and brings new life into every nook and cranny of this game. Nothing ever felt like too much or too little, it was all perfectly executed. It stays faithful throughout the entire game while also adding tons of new features that simply makes the game even better and more engaging. Tartarus in the original games were admittedly really boring and repetitive, although it did still have fairly good level design and music. This remake realizes that fact and goes the extra 10 thousand miles to add a bunch of features to make the gameplay actually interesting and cool. The level design is improved in Tartarus and every segment looks so good. Every character gets so much style and personality and the UI goes hand in hand with the fun gameplay. All of the UI menus, transitions and everything else has so much vibrance in every way. Even the pause menu and the menus within it are so dope and cool to look at, incredibly stylish. One of the main parts of this game's improvements is the voice acting. When it was revealed that everyone would get new VAs, i was obviously worried, but every new voice actor performs their acts flawlessly. Most of them are almost indistinguishable from the original, and even though the others may not sound just like the original, they still fit their character perfectly and do an amazing job all the same. The music in the original Persona 3 games is iconic, and the music in this remake does every OG track justice. Every track is remade to perfection and it never went too far or sounded bad at all. I could never say it's necessarily ""better"" than the original OST, but it's still so so good all the same. There's just so many additions and changes that i love and appreciate so much. It doesn't matter if you played the original or not, this remake will still take you along for an amazing ride with plenty highs and lows in its story. It's a journey full of amazing story-telling, characters, gameplay, and music. Persona 3 Reload is a perfectly worthy successor to the original, and i loved and cherished every single second of it. Don't let these clowns on the internet or in the Persona community dissuade you from playing this game. If you want to play it, then go ahead. Playing Persona 3 FES and this remake are such beautiful memories to me, and i hope you can also make some good memories with this game too.

I remember getting into the Persona series back when P4G released back on Vita, and subsequently playing P3P soon after beating P4G. That was around the time frame of 2012-2014 and now 10-12 years later i got to play the remake of one of my favorite entries in the Persona franchise. 

1. It was slightly tough getting used to the new Voice Actors (at least for the English audio, plan on playing with the Japanese audio my second play-through) but more or less felt like they were pretty well fitting for the all-star cast that makes up P3.

2. I appropriate the fact they went so far as to voice act ALL the social links this go around for every rank, to which is honestly a first seen in the series from 3-5. It seemed a tiny bit easier to rank them up than normal...or i just got lucky with remembering what were the best dialogue choices for them alongside having a Persona of their arcana on me as i hang out with them.

3. New game-play mechanics they introduced through [spoiler] Theurgy [/spoiler] helped shake up the combat style enough to keep things fresh for older players, while those only experiencing 3 through this remake will be in for a treat compared to its original counterpart.

I wasn't really posting this to give a in-depth review covering pros and cons of the game, more so just giving my opinions on my own personal likes from this remake. I think Persona 3 Reload was done well enough to be the perfect entry into the Persona series as a whole, or the best experience of 3 for players who only played P4G, P5/P5R or both.",1707743756,1707743756,True,1,0,0.508175790309906006,0,True,False,False

I started with Persona 3 Portable, then Persona 3 FES for ""The Answer"". Then I bought the P3P port on my Switch. That's how passionate I am with this game.

Now, with that out of the way, here's my honest review, humor me for a bit:

I've seen many trailers of this game since last year, found out a lot of things like new and arranged music, the content compared to the original games, etc. I was kind of disappointed that we won't get ""The Answer"" from FES in Reload, nor we get to play as FeMC from Portable. I was also neutral in terms of the new singer Azumi Takahashi replacing Yumi Kawamura. I've heard some sample music from YouTube and there are some parts that she's good and there are also some that is quite out of place for my taste. Despite that, I want to try this game without my nostalgia blinding me to what Atlus has cooked for this remake.

What can I say, the graphics is good compared to the originals, even compared to Persona 5 Royal. [b]9/10[/b]

[h3]Music:[/h3]
The soundtrack is [b]GOOD[/b] on its own right. It has its own identity. It was never meant to be a ""Yumi Kawamura"" style, and I am fine with that. Lotus Juice spitting fire as always with the rap. ""Color Your Night"" and ""Changing Seasons -Reload-"" also slaps. [b]10/10[/b]

[h3]Gameplay:[/h3]
[b]THEURGY![/b] A welcome mechanic. It is like a ""Limit Break"" for playable characters that can turn the tide of battles. You can only use it when your gauge is full though, and every characters have different ways to charge it fast based on their personality. It's neat and I like it. The rest still plays like neo-Persona. There's 1 more when you hit weakness or land critical hits, and there's ""Shift"" that works the same as ""Baton Pass"" first introduced in Persona 5.

They also added some stuff during the exploration of Tartarus:
- There are some ""petrified"" shadows with shiny things that they're holding. Players can destroy it and get valuable materials for selling or get ""Twilight Fragments"" that are very important, which I will explain further down.
- ""Twilight Fragments"" are valuable items because you will need this to unlock special treasure chests and use the clock in Tartarus (Yep, you can't use your money anymore). You can find these fragments while exploring Tartarus, exploring the areas of the map, or by progressing your Social Links then talking to Elizabeth.
- [b]GREED HANDS[/b]. These special shadows are addition to the existing ""Hands"" shadows. They will sometimes appear when you first step on a floor, and they swipe all the chests available in that current floor. The only way you can reclaim the treasures is by correctly traversing which direction the shadow went. (Yes it is random and there is no way you can know for sure as far as perception is concerned). I kinda hate this new mini-game but after I unlock the navigator's ""Tartarus Scan"", which skips the mini-game entirely and proceeds to fighting, I am no longer bothered by it.
- Monad Gates. There are two types of it, the first one is the type of gate that appears randomly on a floor the moment you arrive. When you go through it, you will fight a mini-boss that blocks your way to the treasures. But once you defeat it, claim the treasures, and go outside, you will have full map of the current floor you are in and the next floor, which is neat. The second type of Monad Gates are the fixed gates stationed in some of the floors with a two-way teleporter on it. Similar to the random gates, you have to defeat mini-boss to proceed, but this time, there are multiples of it, like 2-3 mini-bosses. The treasures you get here contains tarot cards, some lore documents, costumes, etc, so it's definitely worth doing.
- [b]SHUFFLE TIME[/b] is back, but without the actual shuffling like the original games. It's kinda like in Persona 4 where you just pick the cards you want. There's also an Arcana Burst mechanic wherein when you maxed out of Arcana cards to pick, you can never pick another Arcana card for that night, but the usual ""Sword"", ""Coin"", ""Cup"" and ""Leaves"" cards will be upgraded 1 level up. I personally like this change because I'm not fond of the cards shuffling in the original games, it makes me dizzy.
- Ambush. You will need to progress to the game before you unlock this but once you unlock this, it will guarantee a preemptive strike or ""SEES Advantage"" during battles whether you attack the shadows in the front or back. You can also upgrade your ambush by buying URLs in the Net Shop or the guy in the club. A neat addition in my opinion. It makes preemptive strikes easier to do.

They also made changes to how Social Link works with people that the protagonist can romance. You are not forced to enter a romantic relationship with them in order to max their Social Link anymore. Also, technically not a Social Link, but you can now hangout with your team members at the dorm. You can cook, tend plants, watch TV, and read books with them. They also award you with social stat increase and some useful items. I personally like this addition as it adds more character depth and development between the SEES members.

I might have missed some other new gameplay mechanics but this is what I remembered on top of my head. Overall, [b]9/10[/b]

[h3]Story:[/h3]
Story is pretty much the same as the original, but they added some scenes that added more context and character depth like [spoiler]Strega scenes and Takaya scenes[/spoiler]. I'll not expound further in this as it is spoiler territory, but I personally love these scenes.

As stated by Atlus themselves, the game doesn't include ""The Answer"" part of the story, first introduced in FES. It also doesn't include FeMC and her unique Social Link characters. If you don't want that, then avoid playing this game. But personally, I don't mind and I still like that they made it faithful to the original Persona 3. [b]10/10[/b]

[h3]Replayability[/h3]
There is a New Game Plus available on this game, meaning your clear save data can carry over to your next new game. This is useful for people who want to try the game again to experience new dialogue options normally not accessible due to lack of social stat points, try to romance a different Social Link, or to just complete the achievements that they missed on their first playthrough. But story-wise, there is not much worth replaying the game as it has only two endings that I know off. One is the good ending and one is the bad ending where you [spoiler]kill Ryoji[/spoiler] and the game will end prematurely. [b]8/10[/b]


Man, overall I love this game and Atlus made a good remake to satisfy this Persona 3 fan. If you're a fan of Persona especially Persona 3 and don't mind the missing ""The Answer"" or FeMC, or if you're new to Persona in general and a JRPG fan, I highly recommend playing this game. [b]9/10[/b]

Ever since I played the Portable remaster Persona 3 has really stuck with me, standing out as my favourite story and concept in the whole series despite some gameplay problems. My love for P3 only intensified after watching the movies and I was planning on playing through FES as well when Reload was announced, so I decided to wait until this was released to get a full Persona 3 experience.
I should start off by saying that I love the idea of a new version of this game only because it infamously has no complete version, and I absolutely don't want remakes of 2, 4, or 5 because they all hold up perfectly fine as complete games (I don't want a 1 remake because it sucks too bad to ever be playable). Even this apparently won't officially include FeMC from Portable, which is understandable but a little disappointing given that some of the best content in the series is locked behind that route. As a trend I think remakes, reimaginings and rereleases are oversaturated right now and above anything what I want is Persona 6 or anything truly original.
But none of that changes the fact that this is now my favourite game in one of my all time favourite game series.
What I was most afraid of going in was the Persona 5-ification of 3, a remake that drained the incredible personality of 3 out of the game in favour of replicating 5's success. While you could definitely argue there's a little too much 5 in here I can personally say that the atmosphere and unique gameplay that made me fall in love with 3 is completely intact. Atlus haven't backed down from embracing how dark and strange 3 is compared to the later games, and the soundtrack is true to the vibe of the original with remixed and new tracks blending in seamlessly. It's amazing how smoothly they manage to flesh out and expand every aspect of this game, from character and environment designs to plot beats. The new and the old are indistinguishable, something i honestly never expected. It's still Persona 3 in all it's flawed glory, but with massive quality of life overhauls and more story content.
And speaking of that story, in a series about the power of making connections with others, P3 stands out as by far the best and most coherent exploration of that idea. Every link emphasises and strengthens the core themes of the finite nature of life and the importance of connecting with and uplifting others, even the rare mediocre ones like suemitsu or tomochika. It's a story with real stakes and real tension that isn't afraid to kill major characters for the sake of being true to itself, something that few games in the series can claim. The imagery is unforgettable, and the emotional climaxes hit like a fucking train, especially with the knowledge of what comes later. Despite having already experienced this game once, and this story twice, I was completely and consistently gripped all the way through. While 4 has my favourite cast, SEES comes in close second with a universally believable and likeable team that have great chemistry. It might even be the only squad where I can't say I dislike a single member.
I do have a few minor complaints which I'm going to put here because this review is a mess and I don't know where else to put them; i do wish they leaned into 3's weird little original mechanics like party members getting tired or sick and fleshed them out into more coherent systems, rather than just cutting them entirely. Also overall I think smoothing out the gameplay makes it WAY to easy for anyone familiar with the series; I played it through on Hard and it felt like a Normal playthrough of any other persona game, which is kind of a shame for the definitive version of one of the more challenging persona games.
Going to rewatch the movies soon with some friends so I'll have more time to ramble on aimlessly about how much I love 3 then but for now all I want to say is this is near-perfect and truly beautiful, an easy contender for my favourite game of all time and one of the greatest remakes ever.",1707725206,1707725206,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Persona 3 Reload is a fresh take on a game that was held back in 2006 by a dated combat system and graphics. It more than fixes both of these issues, while also remastering the soundtrack and adding a few new tracks. It's a much more welcoming experience for newcomers to the series than the clunky tactics-menu-combat of the original. While still not sporting the most beautiful graphics it is quite alright for anime-style games. The UI is beautiful, as is expected from a modern Persona game, however some transitions feel laggy despite there not being any actual lag.

That aside...
this game is very important to me (as is the original)
I just love how the later parts of the game focus on finding your own meaning in life and how it doesn't even have to be something crazy or impressive because simple things can already be more than enough for some
This really resonates with me on a personal level as that very concept is something I've been struggling with to apply to my own life, even until now and I don't think I will ever truly get over that struggle but that's okay
some things are meant to be the way they are

Ah well I don't have much more to say other than that I really do recommend you play this game...
or at least give it a try if you're seriously considering it because it's absolutely worth it in the end

Essentially Atlus Persona 5-izing Persona 3. It's a fairly faithful remake of 3 with both combat and social life mechanics brought up to Persona 5's standards.

If you've played Persona 5 and/or 4 Golden but struggled to get into Persona 3 FES/Portable due to the downgrade of quality of life features, this is the perfect way for you to enjoy Persona 3. I do wish they could have preserved some niche aspects of the game like FES's more robust tactics system, showing full turn order, and maybe be able to toggle some OST options between original and Reload tracks, but for most fans this will be the definitive version of Persona 3. 

Also a great place to start for anyone who hasn't played a Persona game, despite some mechanics being lost in translation and some fairly sus social link moments Persona 3 is a story about learning how to appreciate life despite its several tragedies and the inevitable approach of death. It's a tale uniquely told by living through the day-to-day life of a Japanese teenager and making connections with the world around you, with characters managing the difficulties of the supernatural Dark Hour in the main story and the difficulties of ordinary life in the social links. As silly as it sounds it's a story that helped me look at fiction and storytelling in a new light, and I'd recommend it to anyone who's even passively interested.",1707700342,1707701190,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This time I‚Äôm doing persona 3 reload though I will add a little bit of persona 3 portable into the review as well.(fyi my next persona playthrough and review of persona is persona 5 royal in April so stay tuned).without further ado let‚Äôs review:

Story:9/10(the story is phenomenal. The theme of life and death and related topics plays so well in my opinion to the games story. I‚Äôll admit like every persona I‚Äôve played the pacing can be kinda wonky and there was some padded filler dialogue BUTTT it‚Äôs great nonetheless and I am emotionally invested/attached to persona 3).

Setting:8/10(I believe the setting taking place in tatsumi port island is bland yet effective. It‚Äôs a new city it feels vibrant at first but the longer you play the less that magic to it is there. Compared to the small town of inaba which also carry‚Äôs the rank of an 8/10, inaba has a small edge in comparison because everything surrounding inaba compliments it. Tatsumi ports island only really has one area that‚Äôs fine and no other area really mattered.I still loved every minute actually being able to move around in the game unlike in persona 3 portable).

Art:10/10(absolutely stunning. Beautifully made. The use of the unreal engine was great. World design is ravishing and character designs in animated scenes and normal scenes are just great. Nothing more to say, it‚Äôs just pretty much perfect to me). 

Music:10/10(portable and reload have perfect soundtracks. I genuinely listen to the soundtrack pretty much daily. Compared to 4 golden which DOES have an amazing soundtrack there are some tracks I just didn‚Äôt like while persona 3 I simply like them all. The remixes to the popular titles are funky at first but I got used to them and grew to also love them).

Characters:10/10(near perfect cast. Junpei?fun loving idiot that you hate at first but grow to love,Yukari?kind of annoying at first but the more you get to know her the more you can relate to her, sympathize for her and like her,mitsuri?she‚Äôs just perfect,Akihito?meathead who isn‚Äôt 100% dumb and has some fun dialogue,Aigis?perfect and best girl,shinji?pain,ken?pain,koromaru?WHAT THE DOG DOIN?As for the side characters, the social links while overall do lack overall value compared to persona 4 golden BUUUTT seeing as this was Atlus‚Äôs first game with social links persona 3 reload and portable have some memorable social link characters like kazushi,chihiro,maya(if ya know ya know),keisuke,maiko, AND Akinari. All memorable to me and my fav side character social links. I‚Äôll say which main cast social Links are in the game play section).

Battle/fights and gameplay:9/10(oh look, we‚Äôre already in the gameplay section.might as well get social links out of the way. My favorite main cast social links are mitsuru(which I only did in portable,‚ÄòI‚Äôll do hers in new game plus on reload),Aigis and fuuka. The addition of interacting with all your teammates as a pseudo social link also really made me like junpei and Ken more than I did in portable. I can‚Äôt directly speak of male social links in portable cuz I played as the male in portable as well.social links out of the way, here‚Äôs the rest of the gameplay review:WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO the fights are fun just like in any persona game. The boss battles are fun and just as great in portable to me and also on par with persona 4 golden which has some great bosses. The hot topic though is Tartarus. I liked the concept of Tartarus in portable but I didn‚Äôt have a lot of fun being in it most of the time, i loved the dungeons in perosna 4 WAYYYY more but in reload? It made me fall in LOVE with how Tartarus look and feel. I just had a great time. Personas themselves are also great design wise and how they work. Using dlc persona‚Äôs we‚Äôre fun, I totally didn‚Äôt use sataneal to ease the grinding(I‚Äôm lying)).

Overall:9.5/10. BEST PERSONA GAME I‚ÄôVE PLAYED YET AND YOU SHOULD TOTALLY BUY IT AND PLAY IT.",1707700875,1707700875,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Has some stuttering issues so haters may want to grab on console/wait for Denuvo to get patched out though.

Since the game is bad at explaining two new additions, I'll explain them:
1)They added pseudo social links with the male party members, you gotta do them quick or they vanish forever and the rewards are smaller but they're mostly at night and still result in you getting a fusion item. I missed Koromaru's on my first run since you just get hinted at it by someone saying he likes to play outside.

2)They added lounge activities with each party member at night, each party member has two they can do (Koromaru's walks don't count, his are TV and brushing him) Doing each activity 3 times with someone results in a major permanent power up such as Yukari's SP cost for healing moves going down to 25%.",1707685939,1707685939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Characters don't feel like they revolve around you as the main character. All of the party members grow on their own as the story progresses and it kept me interested in them throughout the whole game. SEES easily tops both P4 and P5's casts due to their own individual character arcs throughout the story. Junpei goes from the classic anime protagonist's best friend troupe to a determined teammate who keeps the mood light after serious events. Never losing the shine of his original personality, but growing into the new responsibilities he now has. All party members have a similar sort of evolution as the story progresses. I love both P4 and P5 but very few characters in those games truly grow out of their gimmicks.

Combat is basically the original P5 combat copy pasted. Baton Pass (now called Shifting) allows for your whole party to combo their abilities in one turn to hit enemy weaknesses. The new combat ability in this game is the 'Theurgy' system. Basically an ultimate attack that all your party members will passively charge as a fight goes on (but can be kept between fights). It's neat. They have beautiful animations, but they're WAY too strong into late game. Like, one-shots most bosses strong. Offensive Theurgies stack with Charge / Concentrate spells + standard buffs and debuffs + Boost and Amp passives if it matches the Theurgy element. Did that make combat boring? Not really. You're not playing a Persona game to experience challenging combat. You play to stack overpowered shit and see how high the numbers go. And the numbers go high.

Moving on to the other half of this game, Social Links are still as good as ever. I enjoyed all of them, but that's completely subjective. However they objectively don't fall behind P4 or P5's stories. Encouraging a classmate and fellow athlete who refuses to accept help for his clearly failing body, helping a dying man find meaning in his last moments, comforting a child through her parents divorce, listening to an anonymous woman rant about her daily life through text chat in an MMO. The many choices are varied and you will most likely find a character you relate to, or just really like. Sadly (and predictably) this game keeps the long-since outdated system in the original P3 of the male party members not having a social link. There are special events where you can hang out with them, and you even unlock new personas at the end of them, however they are not attached to a Social Link and will not give the usual Arcana Burst benefit from it.

Tartarus begins just as dull as you'd think from a randomly generated series of floors. However, Shuffle Time events after combat give you permanent stat boosts and exclusive bonuses through the Major Arcana cards that show up. Then as you climb further up, you unlock new Major Arcana cards that provide new unique bonuses as well. The dungeon evolves and new doors, treasure chests and special shadows start to appear, all of which provide valuable items and advantages.

Persona 3 has the best story of the three hands-down, with all of your main characters tragically involved in the main plot someway or another. It may not have the recognisable antagonists of P5, nor the unique draw of the TV world in P4, but the Dark Hour (and the mysteries surrounding it) surpass the other two games with its twists. Obviously I refuse to spoil any of it. I miraculously avoided spoilers until I finally got to play this game and I want nothing more than for others to have that experience too. Story is always going to be subjective, but I've played all three of these games and this one kept me locked-in the whole way though.

Party members in combat all gain special passive bonuses by hanging out with them in the dorm. Yukari gets reduced costs on her recovery spells, Junpei gives your whole party bonus crit chance, Aigis gives your whole party bonus physical damage etc. Really gives your party their own identity in combat rather than just being there as human shields for the MC.

[h3]The Bad:[/h3]

Not a real issue honestly, but this game is shorter than the other two. P5 on a first playthough took me ~90 hours, P4 around 80. This game I clocked in 65 hours to finish it. A decent amount of that time was spent either AFK or unnecessarily min-maxing persona fusions too. So I'd estimate maybe 55-60 hours actually playing. Still a long game, but I felt the need to mention it just in-case an assumption was made that this game was as long as the other two.

Party level imbalance became a massive issue as I went further into the game. There is a system that is supposed to fix this. There is a chance that a magic clock thing can spawn at the end of a floor that will give your lower level party members XP, and give them a boost up to the MC's level. Issue is that this only does 13 levels at a time. When I'm at level 60, and poor Junpei is chilling below level 20, I'm not going to use this system due to it requiring multiple uses of this clock to push him up to my level. Me, Yukari, Misuru, Aigis. For the whole game. I enjoyed my harem squad but I would have liked to try my other party members out at some point. The game even suggests to you multiple times to swap out party members to account for enemy weaknesses, but I cannot do that without getting boned by the massive level disparity.

Now for actual party imbalance. Yukari and Mitsuru are super busted, Mitsuru was literally out-damaging me for a decent portion of the game (if you've played another Persona game you'd know how insane that is). Yukari's healing allows your whole party to live every attack, and also allows her to spam her Theurgy multiple times per fight due to her healing giving her a huge amount of charge. On the other side, both Ken and Koromaru are too risky to actually use due to them having weaknesses to Curse and Bless respectively. Mudo and Hama insta-kill spells are kind of common among shadows in this game. So although the idea of having a dog and a literal child in my squad crossed my mind at some points, it was just never worth it.

Opening the main menu at any point forces the game back down to 30fps. Not a big deal or anything but it takes a few seconds to get back up to a normal frame rate even after unpausing. It made pausing the game for any reason feel like a chore when I got back to the gameplay. Again, only for a few seconds, but it turns out you have to whip out the menu a lot and it got old real quick.

Ive played nearly every version of the game, i still got the ps2 disc on the shelf and my ps vita as well. They say this is the definitive version, and I can see where they are coming from but in my opinion this game has a few downsides, Personally for me I find the original soundtrack to be better in many ways, don't get me wrong the actual new tracks they added are great but the remix'd tracks are worse in my opinion, I miss the old mass destruction, like loosing a family friend. I thought they would have learned to add a soundtrack toggle after the psp remake and how people were upset over the new songs. They removed a lot of great features like the fatigue system that rewarded the player for actually taking care of themselves, which makes the bathroom useless anymore and the school doctor useless except for 1 side quest. Another interesting oversight for a remake was not adding in the abilities for links like they do in 4/5 so I find that im doing them for ones that seem interesting and for fusion xp and to get a girlfriend. I like the combat, its really easy like persona 5 best strategy is to go into mini bosses with full Theurgy and they literally cant do anything so I end up steamrolling most encounters. They changed shuffle time for some unknown reason? I think it was fine in the originals just be good at knowing when to press the button? Eventually it will become somewhat like persona 4 shuffle and give the ability to pick 2 cards. I really like this version of the game but for me personally if I do decide to replay I will play Portable no offense I just think it sticks toward the original vision for this game, I still believe there is value to this game just like there is for owning the original versions of persona 4 and 5, sure they may be differences but they can provide a different way to experience a game just like reload.",1707627486,1707627486,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The New QOL Changes and Features for things such as for Character Interactions and General Gameplay have Been things that should have been in the original Like How It actually gives you a choice to romance a Love interest and now doesn't force you to go down the love route (Which should have been in the original in the first Place but Okay Atlus). The New combat features such as shifting (Which was ported over from Persona 5) and the new Theregy system is quite fitting and fun to play and experiment with. The graphics and Ui design has always been incredible sense Persona 5 but Reloads new graphical changes are still fitting to Persona 3 art style but now better to look at and absolutely Freaking Beautiful. Im not going to explain things like the ending because the story and the good ending are incredible and the ending still makes me cry more than it did back in 2006 and the messages it makes are more important and fitting now more that ever.

OR
You played the games starting with p5/this is your first persona game
THEN 
I'd say get it, it's good in the same ways p5 is good and the mechanics they added will feel really familiar coming from Royal.

 but if you expect all that was added into P3 as a whole to be present in P3R, it leaves a good chunk to be desired and added in...so I guess in that way it too, is like the original. 

Do I suggest anyone to play it at some point? Absolutely. If you already have played the other ports/OG p3 then you aren't missing anything and can hold off due to the full price tag rn. Def get it on sale though.

Actually craving for love
What you only want is dub
Greed makes you go numb
Purposefully blocking good thoughts
Hey please doctor doctor
He‚Äôs about to be that patient
Cause I‚Äôm about to knock him out cold (bring him back please)
Whole lotta moves I make on you like dance floor and during this beat down you prolly wish that you can fast-forward (oh!)
Don‚Äôt you worry about it, I'll save some room for your last words (make sure of it)
After I do this, do that and the third

Break Down:
Some things may break me
But always get back up
New perspective gained
From all of the pain and stress
And when I do come back
I‚Äôm stronger than ever before so
Kneel down

I was a bit skeptical of the remake, so I wanted to hold off my excitement of reviewing a remake of one of my favourite stories in a game of all time to have an objective review. I waited till I finished the final boss and experienced the good ending before I said something. 

You can tell this was made by people who genuinely care for the Persona 3 IP and not some soulless remake. The conditions for social links are still strict, the themes and stories are still very much the same, the gameplay and everything has been given a lot of quality of life improvements, though in the case of Tartarus I haven't quite felt it was really that big of an improvement. There is a lot of mention about Tartarus dialogue and all that, but it's more akin to Persona 5's mementos chatter than the interactions that you could have in Persona 3 Portable (talking to the members by interaction in Tartarus).

Gameplay wise, I have no qualms. In fact, it surpasses previous iterations of Persona 3 in that aspect.

However; in terms of the story, I feel differently. I very much disagree with a lot of the story elements. The soundtrack was done by an apprentice of Shoji Meguro. Yumi Kawamura isn't returning for vocals (she's pretty old so I don't blame her for not being able to hit the same chords as she used to) and they have a new singer named Azumi Takahashi on board. But I personally don't really mind that as they both have proven to be able to make songs when they are new content. (eg. It's Going Down Now)
Not to also mention Lotus Juice, who has the midas touch when it comes to Persona music.

I mention the soundtrack is due to the fact that although it sounds fine as it is, it does not have the same impact as the original version. When fighting the final boss of the game, the music is a lot more... muted as compared to the original soundtrack. I can't go into much into specifics out of respect for people who don't wish to be spoiled. In fact, I'd go as far as to even say it feels more 'persona 5-ish' in the newer tracks, which I know some people are fine with. I'm unfortunately the annoying crowd that prefers the old J-pop feeling of Persona 3. I like some of the remixes, but some of them are just not... for me, which is the nicest way of putting it. 

Not only that, but in the ending, there are flashbacks to the whole game as if the game was spelling it out for you that this was your journey. In the older iterations of Persona 3, there was no flashbacks and simply just an intimate scene where there is only dialogue. In my opinion, that's more effective as it makes the player think of the journey they had rather than having the game spelling it out for you. 

Next, I can mention without much spoilers is the MC awakening his persona scene. When he awakens his persona, the shots are too clear as compared to the chaotic angles and shots of the original and FES. When another persona appears from inside Orpheus; in the original version he tears out of Orpheus like a beast, while in Reload, Orpheus literally deflates like a balloon and is stretched open. I'm not going to say which is in my opinion more interesting, but you can infer my feelings pretty easily on your own. 

I'm of the opinion that small attention to details always add up to the bigger picture. It matters to me how things are presented. In my opinion, this seems more in the direction Persona 5 has in its art direction and storytelling style. I understand that it's to get new fans into Persona 3, but I feel like this made it lose Persona 3's individuality to cater to them.

To spell it out like Persona 3 Reload; the remake, while telling the same story as the previous iterations of Persona 3, doesn't have the same impact and effect as the originals in terms of story due to changes like these. 

It's a little bit forgivable as they do not have the old team on board as they're on board working on Metaphor: ReFantazio, though this led to the original vision being muddied in between despite having the apprentices, in my personal opinion.

Due to this, it's also hard for me to recommend this game narrative wise to a person who wishes to enjoy Persona 3's story for what it is, it's not worth it at $70 dollars if you are like me and care about the story. 

But, if you're not iffy about things like that, go get the game. A review like mine won't stop you from getting it anyway. 



TLDR: It's a remake done by people who care about the original IP, but the original people who made the said IP aren't on board. The impact of the story and everything about it is lesser than previous iterations. 

I find it quite hard to recommend it to people personally because of how much the previous iterations of Persona 3's approach to their message about finding meaning in life that resonated with me. The impact of the message, however, isn't there in Reload. 

So, if you want to experience Persona 3 at its best(in terms of presentation), I'd recommend playing FES or Portable (even doe people call it the cheap mobile version of p3 or even p3 the visual novel).",1707588607,1707605085,False,25,3,0.622635126113891602,0,True,False,False

The story of Persona 3 is in a league of its own. The themes are deeply profound and impactful. As the credits finished rolling and I was sent to the title screen, I couldn't help but to call my parents and tell them how much I loved them.

I've been waiting for this!


Atlus kinda knocked it out of the park with this remake tbh. I expected P3R to be brilliant but its surpassed almost every expectation for me. Femc and The Answer epilogue are sadly absent here, but at least we getting one of those as dlc in the future. The tartarus grind does eventually feel a bit tedious still, but there's a lot of improvements that alleviate that feeling and ensure it stays fresh for much longer compared to before. In terms of positive changes overall in P3R, there's too many to list all of them, but I'll highlight some noteworthy ones below.

The new VA's are outstanding. I'll admit I had some doubts about Atlus' decision to get a completely new cast, but each VA gives at least 100% here. Every party member gives nuanced and passionate performances that made me laugh, cheer, and cry in P3R. Zeno Robinson as Junpei is particularly amazing.

The visuals are stunning and a massive step up from FES as you'd expect. The animation work in particular is astonishingly detailed even in small and subtle ways. Seriously just take a moment to watch your friends in the Iwatodai Dorm now and again. I never thought I would be so captivated by watching someone sitting on a couch eating pocky. 
When it comes to character portraits, they're not drawn by Soejima Shigenori this time i believe, but they are absolutely gorgeous and do a great job conveying each character's personality.

There are many, many more opportunities to spend time with party members, regardless of whether they have social links. This is a hugely appreciated addition that does wonders in fleshing out characters that felt somewhat neglected in P3 FES.

Much appreciated introductions of new mechanics to spice up both gameplay and story.
From theurgies, computer software, randomly spawning challenge doors in tartarus, ways to quickly level up neglected party members, etc. There are a lot of new changes that vastly improve upon the now dated gameplay of FES.

The gross transphobic content from operation babe hunt was fully removed. Not just in the US region version of the game, but in every version. Props for that Atlus! Considering your decades long record of queerphobic content in your games, I didn't think you had it in you. If Persona 4 ever gets a similar remake, it could certainly benefit from a similar adjustment.

And then theres the music. There was never really any doubt that the music would be great in a Persona game but wow. This OST pays respects to the original tracks and evolves them in ways that make sense and feel fresh and fun. There's a handful of tracks here that are up there with the very best in the series for me. Color Your Night is some once-in-a-lifetime magical lightning in a jar type shit. Absolutely sublime.


Overall, P3R is a spectacular effort from Atlus and is now the arguably definitive version of Persona 3. It improves upon so much, yet retains every aspect that makes P3 something so very special. This is an absolutely essential jrpg that must be experienced.",1706936139,1707590899,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The soundtrack is great (the only complaint is that you can't play the Digital Premium Edition soundtrack in the background), and the graphics are a significant improvement from P5R.

However, this probably is an unpopular opinion, but I find the game very slow-paced at the beginning. It didn't captivate me well for the first couple of months in the game, and I only continued because I had heard that the story improves later on (which it does, but I couldn't help but feel a bit bored initially).

[b]Rating: 8/10 - Great[/b]

[b]Persona 3 Reload[/b] is a [b]Great[/b] game. After playing it I could finally appreciate the [b]Persona 3[/b] story since, at least for me, the absolutely disgusting-looking visual novel sections of [b]Persona 3 Portable[/b] ruined my first experience with it and made me tune out. There are a few pacing issues in the story in my opinion and I do wish that [spoiler]Strega[/spoiler] had more screen time, but otherwise it's almost on par with [b]Persona 4 Golden[/b] and surpasses [b]Persona 5 Royal[/b]. There are also many really well written S.Links in the game, but sadly the ones that aren't good tend to be either boring or straight up terrible.

The gameplay changes made were also very good. The changes made to the look of the different Tartarus floors really helped with the feel of exploration and the additions to combat were all [b]Great[/b] in my opinion, I was especially fond of the Theurgy attacks. My only gripe with the gameplay would be that they didn't add the Shuffle Time from [b]Persona 4 Golden[/b], since I very much prefer that.

Overall, for me at least, this turned out to be a better version of [b]Persona 5 Royal[/b], more interesting characters, better combat (even if the differences are barely noticeable), a better dungeon crawling experience and an overall better story.",1707406957,1707580678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love this game. This is one of the first games I've purchased on PC so soon after its release, and I have to say that first off, this is incredibly well optimized for PC. Mind you, I'm running it with a Ryzen 5 2600x and a 1060, and while high settings chug a little bit at the mall, medium settings don't look much different to me from high settings and run everything perfectly fine at 1080p. Great optimizing on Atlus' part.

Storyline and characters are great too. The visuals are awesome, combat is something new that I haven't experienced before, and overall I'm having a blast. Highly recommend this to anybody looking into getting into Persona, as this has hooked me and I'm not getting off of this train any time soon. The $70 pricetag is a bit steep in my opinion, so maybe wait for a sale, but I'm having an awesome time playing this and cannot recommend it enough.",1707561680,1707561680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Atlus remakes are (were) always plagued by baffling changes to things that were better off before, but I can confidently say that this is a remake made by people who truly understand the weight and meaning of the original, and they have done a damn fine job bringing it up to modern standards. I adore the original game, but there were definitely areas where it lacked. Its flaws were a product of its time, and those flaws no longer exist in Reload. The new story content is phenomenal, and perfectly compliments the story of the original without stepping on its toes or undermining it at all. Besides the story content, the quality of life features brought to the core gameplay are everything I could have asked for, both in battle and in social life. I've written this review from the perspective of a long time fan, and I am 100% confident that the game holds up from that perspective, but I would also like to say I am confident that Reload would also be a phenomenal entry to the series.

To be as spoiler free as possible the general theme of this game is impeccable its a simple message they want you to take away, live your life to the fullest because time is finite, you need to decide what life really means to you and live it in the way that's best for you. Its simple yet beautiful and I would recommend this game off that alone to anyone who is interested in a heavier topic like that.
Aside from that the story of this game, and whats happening is deeply intriguing, just what if there was something in our day to day life we never knew about, and what wait does that carry? I found myself really enjoying this thought and delivery through its cast of characters, even when originally I would scoff and go ""I don't really like (insert name)"" I spent time with them all and, by the end I found I had stopped because even those I didn't relate to I grew to understand and I think that is what anyone would want when spending so many hours with a character, I simply can't do each of them enough justice without major spoilers but they're great and all have their own roles and stories that grow as you play.
As for gameplay this is greatly improved from the original especially Tartarus which while I found it to be a slog at some points even in a modern adaptation, the updates to combat, things like scouting, and a lot of the games systems smoothed the climb out massively. I would still say in terms of strictly gameplay I think Persona 5 has best moment to moment combat, however this is not far off, and what it lacks in its gameplay it makes up for in what I would consider to be a stronger story. There is simply no way to make something like Tartarus fun all the time just due to what it is but this was a step in the right direction and made it at very least much more enjoyable. As always Atlus tops this off with beautiful UI that simply nobody else makes, some people will argue if its better or worse than the original but that doesn't really matter, both are great.
I do want to say this just for any purchasing concerns because that is a reality when it comes to anything like this, and especially now that games are starting to be 70 USD base, if you are someone who either likes the charm of, or doesn't mind a lot of the grit of an older game Persona 3 Portable is completely fine and good, but if you want the fresh coat of paint, or just want to play the remake, which I will say this is a well done and honest remake, then I think this game is a worthy purchase. If you judge off time to finish alone you will easily make the mark because Atlus makes long games, and I personally would rather pay that for a extremely long game than something I can easily finish in 15-25 hours. I think this is worth it in the end for the price, obviously that is up to every individual but I would still recommend it despite the price.
Overall this game is great, the story is amazing and if it that is what you're playing it for you won't be disappointed, the gameplay while not perfect is still great, and despite what people may say the remade music is still impeccable, the soundtrack as a whole was great. If Atlus continues to make games of this quality I am excited to see where they go. If you have the money and the time I would say this game is worth playing.
I think the most honest way I can rate this game is like this, what I want from a game is when its done and I get up, what does it makes me think, what does it make me feel, what is it trying to tell me and does it accomplish that. This game checks all of those boxes and is solid throughout, I liked it.",1707503363,1707503363,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

From the captivating storyline to the unique blend of gameplay elements, this game has quickly become a favorite in my collection.

Engaging Storyline:
Persona 3 Reload weaves an intricate and emotionally charged narrative that had me hooked from the get-go. The storyline is filled with unexpected twists, heart-wrenching moments, and a cast of characters that feel like friends you've known forever. The game tackles some deep and meaningful themes that resonate with the challenges of being a teenager, making it not just a game but a profound experience.

Stylish Visuals and Design:
One word: stylish. The visual aesthetic of Persona 3 Reload is simply stunning. From the character designs to the unique Persona creatures, the game oozes with a sense of cool that sets it apart. The animated cutscenes are a visual feast, and the attention to detail in the environments adds an extra layer of immersion to the overall experience.

Innovative Gameplay Mechanics:
The fusion of social simulation and dungeon crawling in Persona 3 Reload is nothing short of genius. Balancing school life with battling Shadows creates a dynamic and engaging experience. The Persona summoning system adds a layer of strategy to combat, keeping every encounter fresh and exciting. Plus, the integration of the calendar system adds a real sense of time pressure, making every decision count.

Memorable Soundtrack:
The music in Persona 3 Reload is an absolute banger! The eclectic mix of genres, from J-pop to hip-hop, sets the perfect mood for every situation. The soundtrack has a way of enhancing the emotional impact of key moments, making them even more memorable. I often find myself humming the tunes even when I'm not playing.

Replay Value:
With multiple story paths, social links, and the addictive nature of the gameplay, Persona 3 Reload offers incredible replay value. Each playthrough feels like a new adventure, and the decisions you make genuinely impact the outcome. It's the kind of game that keeps you coming back for more.

In conclusion, Persona 3 Reload is a masterpiece that caters perfectly to the tastes of teen gamers. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, a visual spectacle, and a gameplay experience that's hard to put down. Whether you're a seasoned Persona fan or a newcomer to the series, this game is a must-play for anyone looking for a fantastic JRPG experience.",1707490826,1707490826,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the story, art, and feel of this game... and it reminds me of how Pokemon (when it was good) would release modernized versions of previous games. Between the hype in the community and the quality of the game getting better and better, there is no doubt this game series is in an absolute golden age. I am hoping that some of the feedback received can be applied to improving future iterations of the series much like how the implementation of agile played a huge part in improving the seemingly flawless Persona 5 into Persona 5 Royal. 

KEEP EXECUTING THIS:

1. After 5 different installments into the series, all confidants and their social links are voiced (except the hermit, but it adds to impressiveness considering you are texting the hermit the entire time).

2. Staying true to the original concept of the franchise makes be believe Altus is among the most humble of studios. My favorite part of the franchise is the element of psychology that connects you with the characters in the game world. Finding your place is challenging, but being able relate to Carl Jung‚Äôs persona archetype system each game really adds value to the game as well as the team‚Äôs reputation. Compared to many modern studios, Atlus stays true to the dynamic between its original business model and value to the consumer. 

3. Graphics. I don‚Äôt really need to say much about this because it‚Äôs iconic, but the UI designers are extremely talented. When I was at SCAD, most game art majors would reference persona as the most iconic art in any series of games. 

AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT:

1. The game can improve on a few elements... Outside the main cast, it would appear many of the NPCs are lifeless. This is one of my biggest issues with this game, and by far it is the most noticeable in the club. 

2. Some quality of life updates from Royal were neglected. I really enjoyed being able to negotiate enemies, and I do realize that this is a remake of Persona 3... But I can't help but feel it was still something that could have been added. This does not quite take away from the experience of the game, but I am hoping that future installments of the game can have the negotiation tactics in the series. 

3. It starts off extremely slow, and while it picks up later, usually hooking in the viewer is crucial to story telling.

Alongside time exist fate, the bearer of cruelty.

Only with strength can one endure suffering and torment.

In the face of disaster lies opportunity for renewal.

Yet the arcana is the means by which all is revealed.
Beyond the beaten path lies the absolute end.
It matters not who you are, Death awaits you.

With that said, this game is like a solid 9/10 for me. I've played through Persona 4 Golden, Persona 5, Persona 5 Royal. Unlike those games, it runs on an entirely new engine, the Unreal Engine. As a first attempt for Atlus, the game looks beautiful visually - at least in the sense of still retaining that Persona artstyle while looking new and fancy. This is probably the strongest game in the series when it comes to its theme. Otherwise, it's a little lacking in multiple areas - but well-rounded enough that it bounces back. 

Storywise, the game has a great focus on the theme of death, which can always go wrong in a variety of ways. For the most part, if you have played the original Persona 3, there is absolutely no big story changes. This a one-to-one faithful remake of the original, with recreated visuals and added flair. There may be some added scenes here and there to elaborate on certain story points. Atlus also added plenty of character moments to help the team you're apart of feel more cohesive. If you're new here, the game will do plenty to keep your intrigue - but don't expect some god-tier writing from Baldur's Gate 3 or something. This time around, the characters feel less like they're there to rub your ego and more like their own individuals that will even clash with your decisions. There are new link episodes for primarily the male party members that vastly improve upon their lacking presence in the original games. These add plenty of character building and more emotional weight to the story for those characters specifically. 

For gameplay, this is the same formula used in most Persona games. You summon demons in all sorts of mythology from different aspects of your personality called ""Persona"" to kill shadows. It plays somewhat like a dungeon crawling pokemon game, but it's a lot more complex than that. When you're not fighting the enemy shadows, you're living your daily life and making friends. More friends is good, since it'll boost your personas' abilities while even letting you unlock higher tiered ones. If you're worried that all of previous games' QoL are gone and nowhere to be seen, have no fear, since almost every single mechanic from the newer games have made the transition. You can actually reject and turn down romantic interests without breaking their social link now. All characters have a new ultimate mechanic called ""Theurgy"", speeding up battles immensely. You can pass on turns to other teammates when you hit enemies' weaknesses, there's a somewhat convoluted autosave mechanic, there's plenty of different ways to boost your social stats for some of those requirements later on, and everything in the game is quick and abbreviated. It knows that it's a pretty long game and won't make you sit through hours of animations to get to the action. Even the infamous railroading at the start of Persona games is pretty absent here. You get into the freetime around the hour and a half mark. 

The voicework and OST are amazing. If you play in Japanese dub, the voices suit all of the characters. If you play in English dub, some of the voices may sounds a little grating at times - but to be honest Persona dubs are always relatively decent, this one especially. I swapped between the two to keep dungeon-grinding a little fresh. Between this and AI Somnium Files, the English dubs in both are pretty decent enough to consider if you have the option between Japanese and English. The OST got a whole makeover, whilst still retaining the important key parts of their original counterparts. The new vocalist does an amazing job, but in my opinion - she does far better vocals on the newer songs. While listening to some of the tracks play out in-game, it sounded like some of them lacked the impact and tenacity that the original tracks did. That's not to say she did a bad job, even then, the songs still sound great. However, the new vocalist has a more soothing voice that's suited to the more somber songs in-game.

The UI is something to die for. Although, it was a little disappointing that they decided not to go with some of their original concepts (since those would be more thematically appropriate), the game has so much flair and style that it doesn't matter. This is best UI from any persona game ever, with Persona 5 Royal's being in close second. 

All said, some gripes or things I didn't like about the game:

1. No way to turn of motion blur in-game. (I know there's a workaround on PC, but this should've just been added in regardless)

2. Personal gripe - Tartarus (Main in-game dungeon) gets super dull after a while - with samey environments for 20-30 floors at a time. 

3. Some of the Theurgies (Specifically MC's) feel very underwhelming and experimental - rather than polished.

4. Social Links are the EXACT same, so some of them are very...controversial to say the least. If you didn't like the social links in the original, you will not like them anymore here. (Same just with FULL voicework). 

5. There are not many in-game engine cutscenes, which is a HUGE shame in my opinion. These look way better than the anime cutscene style that they tend to shoe-horn into the games, but that is ESPECIALLY the case here. The new in-game engine looks so nice that it's a waste that they decided not to animate more scenes with it.

All in all, this game is worth the price point if you're a longtime persona fan. 70$ is a little steep if you're a newcomer. You might not like a lot of the game's themes and topics. If you can't buy into the anime wackiness and tropes, this isn't the game for you. If you hate JRPG grinding, this ALSO isn't the game for you. I would nab the game on a sale of 50-60$ if any of the above apply to you. As much as I love Persona games, I have to admit, ALOT of the writing is pretty poor and struggles when compared to modern writing in videogames. I've loved these games for decades, but at the end of the day it's just an anime power fantasy with an overdone highschool setting.",1707481504,1707483841,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a standalone, however, this does well to introduce new players to a modernized version of the game that set the series into it's current form (high-school students combat Shadows). While some bits have been cut or altered, nothing vital to the narrative is missing beyond the Second story line from FES, the Answer, which is rumored to be coming as DLC and ties up some threads left at the end of the game. in return, new events have been added, that flesh out your team members that don't get Social Links, and new mechanics have been implemented to shake up the combat. Tartarus' design has been totally re-worked, it seems, to go with the updated visuals for everything. 
 It does feel shorter than the Original or FES, I did a 100% run in 54 hours. 

Most if not all of the Social Links are now Voiced all throughout the story, which I don't believe was the case for FES, only certain important lines were. On the flip side, many scenes that were animated are now converted into FMVs, which can be disappointing in some places, but also fits well in others. 

The UI feels a bit rushed in places. the Time transition screen is in particular incredibly basic, only showing two solid blue bars meant to imitate clock hands. I also had some stuttering that I don't get on more graphically demanding games, which I feel can be attributed to the ever-maligned Denuvo software. 

The DLC packs are wholly unneeded, only adding new Personas from other titles and costumes, so for those not interested in them, they can be skipped. The Soundtrack is also somewhat aggravating, being integrated into it's own software, instead of just being audio files to be played. 

The dialogue (using the English Voices) was mostly solid, thought there were some spots that felt a bit awkward to listen to, the VAs seem to fit their characters well enough, and did not sound like they were just reading lines or phoning it in. 

While I feel this game could have done with some more polishing, It is still a solid Persona game for first timers to the series. people who never had the chance to play the games on the PS2 will be able to enjoy this fine, and for those who have played, may be able to enjoy the nostalgia while seeing some new events and dialogue.",1707468782,1707468782,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EDIT: As of 2/7/2024 with the Proton hotfix the game holds 60 FPS much more consistently. There are still some areas in Tartarus (such as the 2nd block) that has areas that will dip into the mid 40's and the Velvet Room that will fluctuate between mid 50's to 60.

First thing before you start the game, turn OFF reflections. This tanks FPS in a few areas such as the mall area. 

Even then, FPS will fluctuate wildly. The annoying part is the game will run 60 FPS in most parts of the game EXCEPT the following:

Tartarus (certain sections near the windows tanks FPS to the 30s). The 2nd level of Tartarus occasionally dips to the high 20's specifically in the one room layout with the 2nd floor path. 
Velvet Room (the Velvet Room elevator will go past lights every now and then, and these will briefly tank FPS down to the mid 20s)
Dorm Bedroom (this place is at 40 FPS for some reason)

There is a config.ini ""fix"" to totally disable raytracing (even after you disable reflections ingame), but this doesn't seem to fix anything. 

If you're so inclined, set the frame limit ingame to 30 FPS with reflections turned OFF. The game will always maintain this framerate except for the brief dips to 20 in the Velvet Room as it passes by the lights. 

The game itself is fantastic, but I'm waiting for a performance update patch from Atlus.",1707091970,1707467106,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The UI design is off the walls, Atlus has always been good at designing UIs and I think this is one of their best. Combat feels smooth and fast paced, while still feeling challenging. Tartarus has received a massive visual upgrade, and looks amazing.

If this is the quality Atlus has set for future projects, I can't wait to see what they make next.

[h3]The gameplay has been vastly improved from FES and makes it more alike P4G and P5R.[/h3]
The added character interactions are very welcome and make the game feel so much more personal, [b]being able to hang out more with the male cast and Koromaru is great.[/b]
The music is pretty good! The new tracks fit in quite well and while Azumi Takahashi (The vocalist for the Reload songs) is [b]still great[/b] in her own right, nothing can truly compare to Yumi Kawamura and her style (on the FES tracks). [b]We still get Lotus Juice[/b] saying literally anything and it sounding great!
The voice acting for all social link events is very welcome as it [b]adds a new dimension[/b] to them.
[b]Tartarus is breathtaking[/b] to scale and the added and reworked events in there are awesome.

[h3]Playing the game on Merciless difficulty felt similar to playing FES however the game is significantly easier to beat as [/h3]
Dark attacks and Light attacks no longer being just Instakills and [b]having their own attacks[/b],
[b]Theurgy moves[/b] (Special attacks) being a thing,
And [b]Shifting[/b] (Baton passing from P5).
[h3] Personally I didn't have too much of an issue with any of the bosses on this difficulty but that could probably change. [/h3]

[h3]As of writing this, the only things I find to be a let down:[/h3]
The music is good in some areas a step down in others.
Some of the Fusion spells are missing which is a shame.
[b]No FES' Answer or Portable's Kotone[/b] (FemMC) is a let down but hopefully those will be fixed through DLC and hopefully not another release lmao.
Some of the stuff they change is a tad weird

[h1]Overall I really enjoyed being able to experience this game again, Cried just as hard as I did the first time.[/h1]

It still feels like the original persona 3 did, but now that it's been updated it's far more rewarding to play and I feel more invested in it than I ever did in FES or Portable. As well as quality of life updates, the music is the best it's ever been in the series (the new track for nighttime exploration is my favourite) and tartarus feels more involved and interesting.
I've been playing on steam deck as well as desktop, and I'm really happy with the performance on both. You may notice some slight performance issues on deck at first, but that can be fixed by going into the config menu's graphics settings and turning reflections off (which doesn't actually turn off reflections, it just turns off ray tracing from what I understand).

Persona 3, the original, was my favorite game ever made. It was and still is, very important to my childhood development, my outlook on things, as well as a fantastic teacher to me.
Reload, not only captured that magic once again, but playing through the story as an adult really changed my entire perception of it all, its meanings, its story. Its characters. Looking at it all through a matured lense is a new experience tbh.
The facelift, the QoL, the gameplay mechanics are all VASTLY improved, which is all the game needed tbh. Coulda done just the graphic update and not gave the new stuff/remove fatigue and I woulda loved it
As for the music, while the remixed tracks didnt originally thrill me, nor the new VA's.
I grew to love them just as much, if not more than the original.

If you liked the other persona games, then you'll love this one as well. While I adored Persona 4 & 5's silliness, I preferred Persona 3 because it was darker / more mature and because of its focus on characterization.

It's such a rookie mistake that anyone testing the game should have had no problem finding. The devs should be embarrassed.

Anyways, that's just a little nitpick in the settings. It doesn't reflect the rest of the game. I've barely started any real gameplay so I'll keep my mouth shut on that for now.

But seriously, what's up with every game fucking up button bindings? It's so consistent too, the same few problems in every game. Button overwrite issues, shared buttons, not being able to rebind minigames, not to mention setting menus having inconsistent rules for what counts as ""saving"" the settings. Just Let me press ""B"" then accept the changes. Stop making me press different buttons. I want to leave the menu, so I'm pressing the ""leave menu"" button. 

And worst of all, if you let me leave the menu without making the changes and not telling me about it I will make a sandwich using your ingredients and use the same spoon for all of the condiments so they mix together in all the jars, and there will be no warning for that either...

Yes, P3 Reload are missing some features of previous iterations (for better or worse) and it is not absolutely perfect, but its additions (like the Theurgy system) are very welcome features in which I hope to see in future Persona games.

The bottom line is that if you are a newer fan of Persona, being introduced to the series with P5/P5R, this is a great addition to your digital Persona game library.

Edit after completing the game and 95% of the achievements: I stand by everything I said before. The game is great and the quality of life changes are superb. The UI is snappy and immersive, the new music fits in seamlessly with the original music, the new character art is exceptional, and the game plays so smooth that its almost unbelievable.
The story is amazing and left largely untouched save for the addition of new social elements that feel like they've always been there. The story is also darker than most of the other Persona games, which I personally love.
The changes to Tartarus are also great. In the other versions of the game it could get to be a slog on the higher floors, but they've added enough mechanics and detours that it stays pretty fresh the whole way through. I did feel like the additions made the game a little easier, but the inclusion of Merciless right out of the gate compensates for that pretty well.
All in all, I cannot recommend this game enough if you are a fan of Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, or just story-heavy jRPGs in general.

To all of the people online that are complaining about the lack of The Answer and the Female Main Character, I get it, but if you look at the credits list for modern games and stop to realize just how many people and how much money it takes in 2024 to make a long-form story oriented game, you will begin to understand why The Answer will probably be a DLC down the road and the Female Main Character won't happen.

The combat and gameplay are not perfect.  It feels really really easy even on Hard (which is usually known as harder than merciless).  The best part is the beginning always felt hard to get through, but here there is so much voice acting even in the social links that it was very refreshing to play through dialogue I have already seen and on top of that numerous instances of completely new interactions.

Tartarus feels essentially the same as it always did though.  Shuffle time is revamped, but other than that the enemies more so seem the same, the level design is the same, etc.",1707423072,1707423072,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I‚Äôve sunk well over 20 hours into the game so far (if not, I‚Äôm vastly approaching that number) and the style and combat is so captivating to me and this is coming from someone who dislikes traditional turn based combat but persona just does it so incredibly well and there‚Äôs a very fun flow to the combat that feels fair. I‚Äôve been playing the game on hard and have been able to stick with that difficulty setting without having to lower it like I normally feel like I have to in persona 5.

I‚Äôve been recommended the Persona franchise and specifically Persona 3 for years by people whose opinions I trust. With the release of Persona 3 Reload, I figured this would be the optimal time to try out those folks‚Äô recommendation. 

Personally, it‚Äôs just not for me. The characters are all extremely tired anime tropes at this point. Japan‚Äôs obsession with high school aged students is just beyond me. The shared trauma between the cast is all incredibly predictable and the framing of the game‚Äôs story through the lens of high school and the clubs activities that are part of high school somehow cheapens everything, as this kind of plot anchor has been so commoditized by anime.

The game is mostly walking around, being presented with walls of text, and building up your ‚Äúsocial links‚Äù. This treats the player as almost infantile as the interactions here are so sterile and on rails that daytime game play might as well be a 20 minute episode of an anime that you just watch rather than play. At night, you can enter Tartarus, the portion of the game that‚Äôs fully ray-traced, a procedurally generated dungeon that really doesn‚Äôt have any particular variety and goes on and on, similar corridor after similar corridor. I don‚Äôt think combat even exists outside of this one location, and unfortunately it‚Äôs such a humdrum experience due to the lack of inspired design that I can‚Äôt image playing 70 hours of crawling around this single solitary dungeon. 

The art and design of the Personas themselves, the monsters you collect and summon, are very cool. I wish this game had more emphasis on them and the combat itself. It seems like more of an afterthought to the social and daytime systems, however. You will spend most of the game outside of combat and outside of Tartarus in general. I do believe there are specific things you have to do outside of Tartarus to get certain Personas, but I‚Äôm not sure.

The music of Persona is incredible, as everyone parrots again and again. I‚Äôm not an original Persona fan and I‚Äôve been listening to Persona 5‚Äôs OST for years on and off. It‚Äôs just damn good music. 

If you‚Äôre new to the series, aren‚Äôt a very big fan of modern anime, and are curious if this game is for you, it probably isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs not much new going on here that hasn‚Äôt been done time and time again, and I have to wonder if all the praise comes from people who don‚Äôt consume much media outside of Japan. There are better stories in games to be told with more depth, better gameplay, and less tired tropes. 

*As an side, this game is also currently very broken on Steam Deck, despite being Steam Deck verified. There are areas of the game where single digit frame rates are all that‚Äôs possible. There‚Äôs allegedly a Proton  fix coming, but the fact that this is ‚Äúverified‚Äù is farcical.",1707401080,1707401080,False,13,0,0.552915990352630615,5,True,False,False

I played and beat the original P3, I played through P3FES, I poked at P3P on the PSP, and proudly proclaim that it is my #1 favorite game of all time. Needless to say when I saw this remake was in the works I was beyond ecstatic to see it come to life, and now playing through it I can firmly say that it holds up very well to my fondest of memories.

First of all, the game is gorgeous. The overworld is very nostalgic for me, but it also is simply just beautiful to see a PS2 era game have such a modern glow up. Tartarus is also very beautiful and mystifying, I love the way the floors are redesigned and have their own unique touches on how their floor plans are constructed as well as their overall aesthetics, and it creates a very new and exciting experience to go through each of the blocks and see what's going to be next in store.

The gameplay also feels very polished, seamless, and significantly less frustrating now with added notes taken from the more recent additions to the series. I appreciate finally being able to control every member of my party's moves in battle, as well as being able to switch players in mid-battle to take advantage of extra moves during critical hits and weak point strikes. I do miss the original ""shuffle"" aspect behind shuffle time, though the new version is significantly less frustrating as you don't have to keep track of what you want on screen and can instead easily select what you want as it appears in front of you.

And, of course, the new voice acting is actually much better than I thought it would be. I will forever miss some of the classic VAs from the original, but the new VAs are absolutely fantastic in their roles and breathe a lot of life into the characters I know and love. The writing for the characters has changed over time, but not in ways that hinder the original intention of their depth, and instead bring a different look into their personalities as they are.

Persona 3 has dark and disturbing themeing, which talks very openly about the harrowing depths of depression, suicide, and both losing touch with life and reality as well as and finding new lust for existence, and I appreciate all the additional details added in to this remake that continues to push those themes even harder and more forefront than ever before. Being unrestricted to the filesize of the Playstation 2 disk has opened many new doors that this game couldn't explore before, and I'm as excited as ever to be able to push through those doors and see everything this gem has to offer.

In short, if you're a new fan or an old fan of JRPGs or the Persona franchise as a whole, I highly recommend picking up P3R whenever you get the chance. It's unfair to compare this game to the newer installations, because while it has taken some notes on newer gameplay it's still nothing like the new games and holds its own individuality high and proud.",1707371326,1707371326,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Tartarus no longer feels like a chore and the combat is much better. While the new in engine cutscenes are pretty, the removal of many hand drawn anime scenes from the original (like Makoto awakening to his persona) was a very poor choice that takes away from the tone the original gave off. Most of the new music is good, although some of it feels like a lesser version and just a worse cover of the original tracks. 

All of this can be overlooked with how polished this game is in the new engine, but not including The Answer to (probably) later be a DLC, is some BS. Also, leave it to Atlus to release useless DLC behind a $30 paywall when they're already milking a nearly 20 year old game for $70.",1707013219,1707370829,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I never finished P5R so I felt like I had to finish this one and since I wanted to play the original, then I had no reason not to. I heard that a lot of the issues in the OG were fixed or made more enjoyable and it shows as Tartarus is a blast to explore, social links really make you feel for the characters or cheer them on, and the slow realization that in the end, even if there's a happy ending, sacrifices must be made, and if you play the game you'll see what I mean.

The real reason this game grabbed me so much was the main character, he's a blank canvas, despite other Persona protagonists feeling that way, this one made me feel like I was answering to things to my decisions, that *that* would be the option I would've made if I was actually in his shoes. My social links felt like actual bonds and the emotion was poignant, I haven't had the most decided or balanced mental IRL and a lot of the meanings or themes of the game hit hard, it made me think about what I was doing with my life and how I should deal with it myself but not with the feeling I was alone. I romanced Mitsuru in my playthrough, despite being aromantic, I still felt the love form and how since it was my decisions, it felt like that love was mutual between us, now I know that sounds a bit weird but it's a genuine thing I felt and even if it's weird, screw it, I was weird the moment I came into this world. This game made me re-think my life while I still had the time to, and made me feel such poignant emotions I hadn't felt in years since my Grandfather passed away almost 4 years now, I urge you to give it a try, even if you don't like it, I don't want to spoil it for you.",1706935011,1707362377,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You either have played the PS2 or PSP version and are super excited, or you're fresh off of Persona 5 Royal and are looking for more. Either way, you generally know what you're getting into. As an old SMT and Persona fan, the only thing I can say is that the QoL updates alone make the experience worth the purchase. Really though, there's no reason to not include the FES epilogue in Reload, or the alternate protag from FES too. Considering Atlus hasn't really been a developer known for DLC, it's doubtful they'll add the epilogoe and other stuff later, which is a shame.

Persona 3 is great, but it always suffered from being the first game in the series to use the ""modern Persona formula"", so it was lacking in many aspects compared to 4 and 5 despite all the things it does so well. Reload fixes this, updating the game with new graphics, content and a modern combat system. Reload is the gold standard for what a remake should be. It faithfully recreates the original as it was, fixing the things that weren't so good, and enhancing the things that were good.

The story is the same with a few additions. The updated graphics make it easier to get immersed into the world, and the addition of full voice acting for the social links are also so nice. There are new ""dorm events"" which are essentially mini social links with the main cast, mainly to help with the fact that half the main cast don't have real social links of their own. Some social links also start earlier which makes it a lot easier to get everything done vs the original game. Certain characters, such as the main antagonists, are given extra scenes and dialogue to give them some much needed character development. 

Gameplay wise, Reload uses a modern Persona gameplay system. You can control every party member. The baton pass feature from P5 is back and each party member gets 2 ultimate attacks plus extra characteristics and stats depending on how many dorm events you do with them. Tartarus has more varied aesthetics, with more unique mechanics and easier traversal. There are extra, optional ""monad floors"" that you can enter if you're looking for challenge. The new Tartarus is a massive improvement on what was arguably the worst part of the original Persona 3, and is now one of the best dungeons in the entire series, behind only the palaces of Persona 5.

My only complaint about Reload is what it doesn't have. It's missing The Answer DLC, as well as the P3P content such as the female mc and her social links. These aren't too big a deal, since there's enough new content to make up for what was load and Reload is still the definitive version of P3 now, but it would have been nice to have all the previous Persona 3 content be included, especially femc.

Overall Persona 3 Reload is another great addition to one of the greatest game series of all time, and it's arguably the best one. However, I would recommend playing the game on Game Pass rather than Steam. As much as I love this game, 70 USD is asking a lot, especially when the much more content dense Persona 5 Royal is selling for 60.",1707350802,1707350802,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tartarus looks better than ever but remaking all 260 floors of it really highlights how outdated of a design it is, P5 had the palaces as the main course with Mementos acting as a side dish, so Tartarus being tbe focal point feels like a side dish with no main course, I would‚Äôve loved if it had some human designed dungeons maybe at the end of each section.

Overall while this is my favorite Persona game and up there as one of my favorite games ever, it still has its faults and a lot of missed opportunities for a remake, plus even though the ending is still incredible, it felt weirdly directed, especially a Junpei voice line that felt like it played too early, and what I assume are localization changes making Aigis‚Äôs dialogue a lot less impactful, none of it detracts from how perfect the ending is, I look forward to it being ruined by The Answer DLC",1707349846,1707349846,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That sounds cheesy as hell but that's honestly how I feel even after having not played the original game. I'm not sure if Persona 5 used this engine but that game's environments seemed way more full of life and heart than this game but the characters models here look way better. Music wise I do like a lot of the original Persona 3 songs and I do like the remixes here I just wish they gave an option to use the original sound tracks instead if you wanted to. Combat wise, it's good old SMT with shuffle time at the end like in P4 which is something I admittely wished they phased out in this remake in return for a traditional reward system but it's not something that ruins this game for me.

Overall it's a good game so far, story is interesting and moves at a faster pace than 4 and 5, and it has the same solid foundation the other modern persona games all had. If you liked P4 and P5 there's a high chance you'll like this game. Is it worth 70 dollars? Hell no, wait for a sale.

There is something to be said for the difficulty of the game for those who are fans of the SMT games as a whole; it is much easier than the original   game simply due to the fact you can grind without penalty. That in addition to baton pass from pesrona 5 being brought over to this game as well as the theurgy mechanic means you simply have more powerful options than you did in the original which does make fights easier to approach. This is not a bad thing in and of itself, but for returning players to this game you may wish to play on hard difficulty or higher in order to preserve the tension that was felt in the original game. I have not beaten the remake yet, but having beaten all versions of this game previously multiple times, I can say atlus has done a fantastic job with this re-imagining of a beloved classic.",1707322779,1707322779,True,1,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False

Persona 3 Reload is *almost* the definitive way to play Persona 3.   The only thing missing is the option for P3 Portable's FeMC, and P3 FES's The Answer.  There are indications that The Answer will be coming as DLC.

Graphically, the game is absolutely gorgeous.   It retains the aesthetic of Persona 3 while bringing in the style of Persona 5.
The music is absolutely SPOT ON.   This is some of Shoji Meguro's best work (But i still stand that Digital Devil Saga is his best work.

I had enjoyed the narrative the most while also appreciating the more unique gameplay compared to both earlier and later entries (I am a rare Persona fan that has actually played Persona 2, but not rare enough to be a Persona 1 player.) I had my gripes with the original in the form of more janky game mechanics like downing enemies and bosses being very clearly overpowered for chain-stunning, party members having very inconsistent viability when your only method of control was the tactics system (aside from having direct control on the main character), not much development for nearly half of the party because they lacked social links (unless you played portable, which would still have the same problem anyway just with the same gender as your MC of choice), the fatigue system as a whole (even if it became irrelevant in the mid-game and onward), and the lack of presence some antagonists had.

Persona 3 Reload has fixed just about all of this for me. I'm still going through the game (currently in September, so I only have a few months left in the game) but I feel I can confidently say that P3R, even without The Answer, is the definitive way to experience Persona 3. While I wish The Answer was in the Reload from the get-go, despite the very controversial status it holds due to its quality in FES, I feel that the main story of Persona 3 with FES and Portable's QoL changes are more than enough to make the game stand on its own. Maybe Atlus will just give us The Answer as DLC anyway. I can actually mix and and match my team without concern of, say, Koromaru being near worthless in FES because his skillset is primarily Dark magic so he'd miss his instakills when I want him to use Fire skills or whatever. In Reload I can actually make use of Koromaru as a mixed Dark/Fire magic user and support with crit boosts and increasing my team's physical damage output. I can actually go at my own pace and take a moment to grind if I need money or extra EXP for my lower level party members without fear of the fatigue system just ruining the pace. Direct control on all party members does have the side effect of making the game generally easier, but I think this is worthwhile to actually have enjoyable gameplay and shifting the difficulty around having actual coverage as a team than just on your main character while your party members are forced to play support. Even then, if direct control just isn't the way, the tactics system is still there. It's watered down though which is a shame, but it at least is usable. And for what it's worth, playing through the game on Merciless has still brought a surprising amount of challenge for me despite having direct control on all my party members.",1707299969,1707300165,True,2,0,0.52893674373626709,0,True,False,False

The voice acting is great, the remixes are banging, and the additional story elements are well-done. This quality without being a reboot is exactly what I wanted--and didn't get--from the Final Fantasy VII remake. Pleased to report that they didn't overhaul my all-time favorite game for a new audience.

If you've played Persona 5/Royal, P3R isn't as polished a game. Social links are more diverse, but most are not as memorable or nuanced as they are in later games. But considering the original P3, in 2004, was the first iteration of Social Links, the calendar time-management, and All-Out Attacks? Respect where it's due.

Never Played a Persona before:

- Half the game is dungeon crawling with turn-based combat. Half is a social sim/time manager.

- You better like reading, although the new voice acting means less of it.

- Punchy turn-based combat is kinda adjacent to Pokemon (in that it has a colorful character doing elemental status effects on your behalf,) but you can mix your minions together to get better minions. Very unlike Pokemon, you have party members that each fulfill an elemental role, and your fights are in groups.

- More forgiving game play than other Shin Megami Tensei main-line games, if you've come here from SMT 4 or 5. Also less parable and more slice-of-life plot than most of the other SMT games.

- Crank the soundtrack!

- This game is about death. You are going to have some feels.

Newer Persona Fans Should Know:

- There is one dungeon. Rather than that dungeon being about party members (Persona 4) or malicious adults inflicting their will on party members (Persona 5), each character has different motivations to enter the dungeon. That dungeon is randomly generated and does not have the kind of puzzles you see in 5, nor the brightly-colored hallways of 4.

- There are a few social links that really make the game, and many are less memorable. Hermit, Hanged Man, and Sun are some of the best outside of your party members. Magician, Chariot, and some of the others are more boring, slice of life stuff. As this game reflects the original Persona 3, there are tragically no male party member social links. (This is where Persona 3 Portable shines.)

- More magical realism and off-the-wall designs. Your teachers are absolute characters, for example.  

- Just keep going for All Out Attacks. I promise.

- This game is about death. You are going to have some feels.

Persona 3 Fan:

- No Femc

- No male party social links

- Removed the first hours of slogging through a town you weren't allowed to interact with

- Significantly easier combat for several reasons, from button economy to status effects to vastly improved navigation.

- I have never seen in-game characters resemble the original design and marketing work this well, and it is glorious


In conclusion:

Not everyone is going to appreciate a slower, plot-heavy anime game about death. But this is probably the best slower, plot-heavy anime game about death ever made.",1706989585,1707295149,True,2,0,0.505247354507446289,0,True,False,False

An excellent story and a really fun game bogged down by the limitations of a system far too limited to show the intended beauty of the environments, a sparsity of content and a couple really bizarre design choices here and there.

This fixes everything, which is really on par for ATLUS remakes. There is a lot more character interaction that you might be used to from P4/5, with proper social links (if not arcana-based) for the entire crew and then some. The main story had some extra stuff added to fill in some gaps, and being able to interact with Strega is a huge deal as well.

Tartarus is still... [i]there[/i], and it's still the same randomly-generated predictable mess that it was before. But now it looks gorgeous, and the different blocks actually feel different from each other. A few additions to its formula such as the extremely challenging optional boss fights and the extra rewards help spice it up just enough to feel at least on par with P4's dungeons, which is a big improvement.

Both the combat and the social systems are at the deepest they've ever been in this series. The ability for some social links to unlock others, or the ability to reverse social links, has been completely removed from P4 onwards -- but this game brings those back, which is excellent. The addition of Theurgy gives each character a distinct role that they're encouraged to play, but it's in no way forced on you so you can still play your way.

It also goes without saying that the new talented voice cast does a phenomenal job of helping the game's story move along. If you're one of the people who play in English, then you're no longer stuck with the robotic and emotionless voice of the original game.

My only remaining complaint is the somewhat slow pacing at the start of the game, it takes forever to fully introduce its systems and to allow you to interact with its main cast properly. However, it's a shorter timespan than in the original, and there's a lot to do in the meantime.

I'd like to address a few additional concerns that I see some people bring up: [list]
[*] This does not have FES content. This one is... simply not true. All of the extras FES added to the main game are here. What is currently not included is Episode Aegis/The Answer, which is allegedly coming as DLC eventually. The Answer was [i]always[/i] a DLC (well, an append disc) in Japan, so this isn't too surprising.
[*] The soundtrack/artbook are locked behind custom executables. This is true, and was probably done by ATLUS so that they could also release them on consoles (as they don't have support for proper file management). If you want the actual files, they are trivially extracted from this Steam version, so it's still worth a purchase (if you care to have these things).
[*] No Kotone/FeMC. This is true. However, her presence is largely made redundant by introduction of social interactions for the male crew members, which was the main selling point for her other than just her being a girl. Her storyline also introduced a few flaws into the story of P3, breaking some of its themes and making a lot of the characters come off as much worse than intended, so that's not a playthrough I'd recommend to a new player. If you care about her simply because a female character is easier for you to identify with, I'm sorry, there's not much there can be done other than waiting for someone to mod her in or playing Portable. However, if you care about her because of the story improvements in her route, you'll find a lot of the same things done in Reload, and done better.

I know that a lot of people in this fandom are going to rage just because I gave a negative review, but I feel that my justifications are valid.

TLDR; This game feels like it is struggling to maintain what made P3 great, while also trying to cater to the new design philosophies present in P5. It just doesn't work super great in my opinion, and it makes this game feel inferior to a modded FES version.

*Yukari's VA performance feels like a major shift from the way she was originally portrayed in P3
*Redone music is subpar in my opinion
*Premium editions are locked behind a laucher, so you don't even own the music.
*While the combat has vastly improved, the cutscenes and environments are lacking major updates.

This game honestly feels like they gave it to a ""second-string"" team to develop while they make P6 a masterpiece.  I hope this is not the standard going forward for the games.",1707278583,1707278583,False,35,5,0.545947253704071045,0,True,False,False

I still prefer the looks of the original, but this is a great experience even after a decade of playing the original.
Pretty much everything was kept that should've been and no bloat was added.
The OST has some interesting takes, hit or miss between the originals and the remixes, but it's still an enjoyable bundle of tracks.
Visually you get what you would expect from a Persona entry after the success of 5. They kept most of the defining factors of the original and gave a lot of life and personality to Tartarus. My only gripe with graphics is the limited amount of settings, mainly looking at motion blur. Hopefully some future patches will add more options to graphics.
Gameplay wise the core is what you would expect from P3-4-5. For newcomers it's a treat and it wasn't much of a pain to get used to the changes either. The new battle skills are fun and add some more depth to the fights, but because of it the difficulty feels rather flat; Currently only finished the game on hard, but it was a breeze. Tartarus also feels easier somehow, the amount of resources you find in this version feels a bit extensive.
New story scenes and events were cool and engaging, the few ""rewritten"" parts don't really do much and are barely noticeable.
A lot of QoL was added to the game which is a question of taste whether you like it or not, it makes the game more casual in many senses, but overall, I can't be mad at any of them. Maybe the Elizabeth request markers hold your hand too much, but that's the worst I can think of.

The game has very little in the way of adjustable settings but seems to run well enough! There's only two slight issues I've seen so far centered around the menu. The menu seems to be capped at 60fps (while the actual game can go up to 120), so when leaving the menu it actually takes 3-4 seconds for the game to ramp back up to 120 in gameplay. Obviously not a dealbreaker but it is noticeable and slightly annoying. The other issue is that while the game's rendering resolution can be increased to 200%, this does not seem to apply to the menus either. Running around in-game is fairly crisp with the resolution scaler set to 200%, but when you enter any menus you immediately notice that it's lower res and you'll see some pixelation due to the lower resolution. Again, nothing even close to a dealbreaker, but these are small issues that I feel we shouldn't be seeing in games in 2024. 

As far as the game itself, I feel like we all understand the gist of Persona now, so I won't get into the specifics of the game. This is my first time playing Persona 3, and I'm a big fan of the franchise and was interested to see what Atlus would do with a remake. You can tell that they definitely tried to stay as faithful to the original as possible, as in terms of gameplay it's much closer to Persona 4 than Persona 5. It's more dungeon crawl-y with less narrative bloat (and actually has some of the same systems as 4, like the card system for your rewards when defeating shadows) - personally I like how narrative/story heavy that 5 is and I miss that here, but I wouldn't say either way of doing it is better than the other, they're just different approaches to designing games. If you really liked the more dungeon crawling focus of 4 and hated the Palaces in 5, then you'll definitely like 3 (with the opposite also being true. If you really liked the palaces you'll probably be disappointed here, as 3 has one dungeon called Tartarus, and it's essentially the same idea as Mementos in Persona 5). 

I'm not far enough in the story and haven't spent enough time with the characters to comment on those aspects, but in general I do think the game looks good. It's not anything cutting edge, but you can tell that it's still an improvement over Persona 5 (particularly with shadows/lighting, I'm noticing a lot more shading and secondary shadows in the environment than I would see in Persona 5). The menus/UI are all very stylish as well, but it's more of a 'clean' type of aesthetic - sort of sleek and modern looking. 

Overall, the most important thing to know with this game is that Atlus was intent on keeping it as faithful to the original as possible - while they redid all of the voice work and redid all of the visuals, they still followed the beats and story from the original as closely as they could. That means that there's definitely some outdated mechanics and game design on display. But I feel like they've added enough quality of life improvements to at least make it decent in today's landscape, rather than letting it stay painful to play through a modern lens. And at the end of the day, it's a Persona game, so I feel like by this point you know all that entails and what you're getting into. I'm a big fan so I already knew I'd have a good time, and if you're a brand new fan then you might be better off starting with 5 as it's the most modern.

Spoiler free review.
Alright, long time persona 3 fan here. I grew up with this game. I literally picked up P3 FES blindly years ago and got very much surprised, satisfied. The game contained so many raw and strong emotions, it wasn't only about the gameplay but also about the overall depicted world.

And i think that everyone who knows the game might agree with me in that, while the new graphics and flashy art is cool and all, it just doesn't convey the atmosphere and tone of the original persona 3. Gloomy, gruesome, macabre scenes and dark allusions. They all got """"subtly censored"""" in a way. It got way too soft. Just look at the prelude of the two versions, for comparison.

And i mean, the game literally contains suicide allusions, at this point why are you not going all out like the original? You guys are basically showcasing a censored story now.
How do i put this; it's like narrating the tale of Little Red Riding Hood without using the words kill, eat, death, blood. You know what i'm saying?

So yeah, thumbs up for the improved ""dungeons"", new dialogues, and the overall faster/nicer GUI and combat system, but still. 
Sometimes, flashy and fresh stuff isn't always the best option to tell a story, you know? Sometimes it's better to keep it simple, let your imagination fill in the blanks. If the game does everything for you, imagination-wise, what's the point?

You can appreciate persona 3 reload only if you know where it comes from. Go grab an emulator and play P3FES",1707261308,1707263295,True,6,0,0.48353809118270874,0,True,False,False

I'm fine with some things not being animated cutscenes that were in the original, but in key moments, like Orpheus awakening, not having the hand drawn animated cutscene feels awful. Sure, they had a rendered cutscene, but it just isn't the same. The remixed songs have mostly been not great, which is a shame because I really enjoyed the original's soundtrack. I'm mostly fine with the art direction, however, not drawing the protagonist's clothes feels lazy. There's just a shadow over the clothes. Also, there still isn't a definitive way to play this game, which a remake should have fixed. There's no female protagonist option, no The Answer, and no Desert of Doors. Junpei doesn't sound as good or as young as he did in the original game. I'm going to continue to play the game because the frustrating thing about FES and the original was not being able to control your party members and this game gives you that, but so does Portable. Maybe they'll add the content in DLC, but considering what feels like a lack of effort and an insane asking price for the base game, even if they did, I might not buy it",1706859463,1707248987,False,242,20,0.624500930309295654,0,True,False,False

Still this is a good remake but the people who enjoyed how hard the game was in the OG might not like this as they toned downed the difficulty with some specific mechanics but not all is bad as they added a few quality of life features that makes both the school life and the dungeon crawling aspects of the game more accessible and fun for new players. I highly recommend that you guys play without any of the DLC personas for your first play through as they can easily allow you to bypass most of the bosses very easily. With this game standing by it self this is a great quality game that we don't get in today's gaming industry and I highly recommend it to anybody who played Persona 5 or people who like JRPG",1707247226,1707247226,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Two downsides I will say is you cannot choose to use the old songs and from the beginning of the game to the protagonists awakening everything has little effort put into it's cut scenes and atmosphere.

Tbh I like everything else about the game I would recommend it for first playthroughs only if you can accept the cutscenes are a downgrade from FES and you can't select the old songs.
I hope they release that as an option and with rumours of more DLC I am 100% on board for a setting to just have the old, FES and Portable songs. Hell I'd even pay extra just for The Answer. However that is unfortunately not in (currently).

FeMC has 0 plans to be added and tbh I don't mind it, Kotone Shiomi is fine and you would have to know her story when you decide to play Q2(if it ever gets ported). But atleast it's preserved in the Portable rerelease.",1707238176,1707238176,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I‚Äôd recommend this to newcomers and people who haven‚Äôt played the original, with the caveat that this doesn‚Äôt emulate the experience of the original game, this is Persona 5 telling Persona 3‚Äôs story, this is not a remaster of Persona 3. For some people that makes the game better, for some worse; I‚Äôm neutral.

For new additions, theurgies are stylish and brutal ""ultimate"" attacks that kind of break combat for me. I‚Äôm really not sure if combat was designed around them or not, but I always felt like I was cheating when I used them. Especially by the end, completing your compendium grants an attack that basically one-shot everything with the exception of [i]that[/i] infamous secret boss.

The Japanese voices sound just as I remembered them, the soundtrack does not. I like the new tracks, (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going down now‚Äù might be my new favourite battle theme), but tracks that were ‚Äúremastered‚Äù sounded significantly weaker than the originals. I don‚Äôt think the new singer is bad, I think she‚Äôs got a higher pitch voice than the songs were intended for. Mass Destruction and the credits theme especially were upsettingly poor, and those are two of the most famous songs from the original.

While I found the new additions a little weak, I still loved my time with Reload and if it weren‚Äôt for the surprisingly high spec requirements, I‚Äôd recommend it as the definitive version of the game.

You only ever go into 1 dungeon, over and over again (think mementos but... that's it). Other than color the dungeon looks the same in each section.

For me P3 in general is one if not the best Persona game in the whole franchise and the Remake is imo the best way now to experience this masterpiece

i might not be far yet but so far im happy to say the improved alot of thing since P3FES and P3P for me.

The voice-acters might be different but still capture the personalities of the old Cast very well the music is remade aswell and i have to say i love all the remade Tracks as much as the old ones (yes they are different but still have the same vibe for me)

Combat is now updated and Teammates are allready on Direct command unlike as it was in P3Fes and i think P3P (cant remember if ur mates start on ""Act freely"" there or not) they added the Baton pass from P5 (not the Attack boost just that u can chain weaknesses more easily) and they added Light and Dark skills that work like Agi and Bufu and stuff like that

The visuals are insane. i love them so much especialy when u hit a weakness of an Enemy 

u can tell alot of time went into this remake and im happy it turned out as great as it is now

[h3] TL:DR Point score [/h3]

[b] Visuals: 9/10 [/b] (some small stuff like lighting seems a bit of but that might just be me)
[b] Music: 10/10 [/b] (Remakes of the Old Tracks and some new ones that still hit the Vibe of the original)
[b] Gameplay: 10/10 [/b] (still the same as the old with some QOL additions and improvements like Baton pass)
[b] Story: 10/10 [/b] (it hits Hard no matter if u play the old versions or the remake)

[h2] My Total Score for this game: 9.75/10 [/h2]

Reload is a strict remake of the original, it changes very little but enough to spice it up for older fans and bring it in line with the newer Megaten titles to ease new players into it.

Ultimately, I find Reload to be a mixed bag when it comes to quality. There are weird inconsistencies with the graphics - almost feels like there are lines filtered onto the screen, and some UI/cutscene elements are painfully low FPS in relation to the game. A few of the anime cutscenes were awkwardly animated. Some of the English VA's are poorly chosen, Yukari is basically a different character with a completely different inflection and feels inconsistent to me, she also doesn't sound much like her original game counterpart - the same can't be said for some of the other VA's like Junpei or Mitsuru. It completely took me out of the game hearing some lines by characters which sound entirely like a grown adult pretending to sound like a teenager. The Protagonist has completely different animations and VA. A FeMC route or 'The Answer' are nowhere to be found. Day one DLC are lackluster at best. I actually thought the soundtrack was one of the best parts of this game, but I have heard complaints about the new singer, which I can see although I do not agree.

There are many imperfections and weird inconsistencies with this remake, but I am glad it was made. Persona 3 (outside of the newly ""remastered"" Portable) has been an experience nearly unobtainable outside of emulating, and is notorious for driving people away with its dated mechanics. Reload updates many of the older games mechanics and graphics while still keeping the essence of the game alive. It really does feel like a true remake, and for that I have to recommend it to those seasoned in Megaten games wanting more. I still think first-time Persona fans should stick with Persona 5 Royal first.",1707195613,1707195613,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

In a way, it's the Yakuza Kiwami of Persona. Gameplay wise, it's very much a refined p5, with some obvious changes to make it feel more like p3. However it follows the story of the original persona 3. 
Both of these are great! As I never enjoyed playing persona 3. No party control and awful dungeon generation made it a chore. But now it's like getting the interesting story of persona 3, inside an actually fun video game! Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys modern persona games.

Semi?-Spoilers ->

Being a massive fan of Persona 5 Royal and Persona 4 Golden and since I've never experienced Persona 3 before I decided to purchase this game 7 days before it came out. After around 25h of playtime with nothing but build-up (which would have been fine if not great) and considering my diminishing free time in the near future, these games massive lengths to 100% complete and the fact that despite loving P5R, I absolutely hated the shit out of its ending (especially compared to the original P5 ending), I've made the probably ill-advised decision to watch the very last 60s of this game's ""true"" ending just to see if it was building towards something satisfying and was worth the 100-120h grind.

And I'm glad I did, because despite it's adequacy for the major theme of the story itself and the overall overwhelming praise that it gets from sad weirdos online that are so desensitized they can no longer feel anything if it's not at it's most extreme level of brutality and depravity, this game's ending is so garbage, so utterly trash and destructive to the over-all gameplay element of building your character and your relationship with the other characters around you over an immense period of real-life hours, that I now regret ever buying the game in the first place. 

It's such a massive downer that is just dropped on the player after they've likely spent at the very least 80h progressing though the story, that it just completely killed my enthusiasm and willingness to even complete the game.

TLDR: Only for hardcore masochists that can only get hard by cutting off their dicks after 48h of edging,",1707166581,1707166771,False,3,3,0.433904379606246948,4,True,False,False

The storyline is relatively the same but with a bit of added plot. Tartarus looks amazing with the visual updates and the new mechanics with the battle system is nice plus as well. This game is great for veteran persona players to walk down memory lane and for new players that are new to the series and wanted to try a Persona game.

1.it is persona 3 so you know what you get story wise
2. More free time to spend than originsl and portable
3. Added social link is good
4. New system make it easy to balance team lv.
Cons
1. Camera zoom during tartarus is bad because you can't see surrounding area while you minimap is comically just too large
2. Fusion not requiring persona in hand making end game just min max
3. The change to how split up works is making grinding longer
4. Academic stats is waay to jacked
5. Ost and artbook is clunky (there is a fix but it is not official)
6. Graphic setting are very basic, why you want a motion blur in persona game
7. Pricing is bad with added drm
8. Difficulty is too low exc certain enemy

The remake fixes a lot of balancing issues that old JRPGs had. 
The biggest change from the original being the light and dark spells also doing damage, like in Personna 5. 
If you played the P3P, P3 FES or original P3, and enjoyed, this game is for you.
If you didn't and enjoy the persona series, or JRPGs, or games focused on amazing stories, this game is also for you.

They also completely re recorded the music if im not mistaken and it is actually better than the original.

BUT WHAT ISNT BETTER IS THE DUB. The dub is atrocious. The characters have been de snarkified and they just lack emotion and character in their delivery, not to mention Sanadas voice actor is completely miscast. Dude should be playing some spec ops tough guy not a high schooler, just compare it to the original and you will see. I would not play this without japanese VA as they actually really good and infinite amounts better than the english

Sega decided to get a bunch of talentless hacks from youtube like Yong Yea to record voices for the english so who can be surprised really? Utter disgrace.

The ""Persona 5""ication clashes with the original story and characters while bringing none of the advances from P5. 

Most of the original English cast is still working and available but has a new cast try to sound like the original. No shame to the new actors, I'm sure its not easy to copy someone else's performance, but they sound like the original but with a cold. I would have rather them do their own thing.

Bonus++: DLC with the female protag and appropriate storylines would be cool, but it's not a deal breaker to not have it. As a female gamer, kinda used to games not having a female protag and it doesn't make a difference to me at this point - the game is still stellar.

My introduction to the Persona series was with Persona 4, and then I played 5. They were all both enjoyable experiences that I might attempt to reexperience at some point in time, more so after starting my playthrough of P3 Reload.

Right off the bat, the opening music is an absolute BANGER and I never use that word. The UI is not only smooth, but pleasing to look at as well. I know there are some people who played the previous iterations of P3 and would prefer the old UI, animations, etc, but as a newcomer? Oh, I love this.

$70 is a bit steep for a game, but it doesn't bother me too much as at some point most $60 games will be boosted to $70 to adjust for inflation and what not. I think a rule of thumb is if you can at least get 30 min to an hour of gameplay for every $ spent, it's worth it if you're having a good time. Bonus if you get more hours of gameplay from it.

I read that the previous iterations had a female protag and it does suck to miss out on that, but it can't be helped. The battles are smooth with features to speed through under leveled enemies and everything looks like it's been paintedf with that  Persona 5 coat. I'm enjoying the voice acting from the cast of characters, even with Akihiko deeper voice.

I definitely recommend playing the game for that good ol' Persona playstyle. But god, I wish the school questions weren't so ODD, this game makes college exams look like vocabulary quizzes.",1707116583,1707116583,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Not too long ago I have started playing it again, noticing some flaws of the PS2 version.
But still, it was quite enjoyable and had a big nostalgic factor.

I have not expected P3R to be released, but when I saw it, I simply had to purchase it straight away.
This new iteration blows my mind. It works up the issues of the older PS2 version and really elevated the beauty of the main game.
I so love that they kept all these twisted nuances like the shot to the head to summon a temporary ally to fight for you.
And the models, the style, the UI, the music. Despite the big update of those elements, they all carry the actual soul and body of the original.

Small exciting note but at least it looks like after you run the game and soundtrack for a first time any future times won't require an internet connection. Please note I did not test the art book. 

For the cost it was to have a soundtrack why is it so hard to use? I wish it was not mashed into the persona game so I can have this review only on the bonus content. Once you have access to the track list it is keyboard input only. You can't click on anything with a mouse. There's no way to close or shrink this music player inside of the app. Ctrl esc will get you out it but in this state the music will be stopped. A sound track on a computer you can't listen to while working. 

I personally use soundtracks as being in transit entertainment (like the MC) or while working. You can't use it for either. Who is this even for?

I'm really upset with myself for preordering because of blind brand loyalty. This really shattered my trust in Atlus. If you buy the game don't get the fancy versions.

as UI/UX guys (ik its just website-ish stuff... but still) UI in this game is really goood  !
there's improvement for animation, the model is also very nice !

back then i have no interest with the girl except mitsuru but rn they are... woow, holy why are they so cute, gorgeus, etc xD
the BGM... as usual is LITTTTTTT

If you love JRPG this is must try !

trust me its worth it and ignore this game if you hate dialogue heavy game (i love it tho)

I Hope they will also REMAKE PERSONA 4 TO PERSONA 4 ""R"" :D

I was pretty pessimistic to say the least.

I was definitely wrong, Reload brings the polish and refinements of the latter two games to the combat system with a few new additions, but aside from the quality of life features, modern graphics, and rearranged soundtrack, Persona 3 Reload is a very faithful remake to the original game.

The script is (thankfully) largely identical to the original release, with much of the dialogue lifted straight from the original translation we received almost 20 years ago. Atlus wisely avoided adding any new major story additions like new characters or plot points, which have had mixed levels of success with their re-releases over the years.

Of the three major pillars of Persona 3's gameplay loop, the dungeon crawling was always the weakest. Atlus has made several changes to Tartarus to make climbing the tower more engaging. I'll list several I've noticed in the first handful of hours with the game.

-Rooms and hallways are bigger, allowing you to more easily maneuver around and avoid, or ambush, enemies compared to the original.
-Shadows wander around more, and most importantly don't take forever to change the direction they're facing. This cuts out a huge amount of the downtime present in the original games and further aids gaining player advantage in battles.
-You can no longer split the party up, but the addition of a dash button makes finding the exit on each floor quicker and further aids in avoiding or engaging enemies.
-Rare chests now appear and can be opened with a new currency you can find in Tartarus, as well as outside the the tower.
-The environments and layouts of each block are more distinct and varied.
-You can now teleport to the staircase of each floor whenever you want provided you've found them on the current floor you're on. This allows you to still continue to search for treasure before moving on and eliminates backtracking. This teleport persists for the rest of that night, even if you return to the Tartarus ground floor. This makes grinding and runbacks to the guardian bosses less time consuming.

All pretty good changes, While still staying true to the original feel of the P3's dungeon crawling. Some people might have preferred more changes, but I appreciate Atlus improving what was already there, rather than trying to change P3's dungeon experience into something it never was.

With all that said, I'm pretty happy with how Reload turned out. It's pretty clear the dev's understood what made Persona 3 stand out from its successors, and I'm grateful they elected to polish up the Persona 3 experience we are familiar with, rather than completely redefining it to be more like Persona 5, or something else entirely. 

Here's to hoping they do something with P1 and the P2 duology in the future.",1707109340,1707109637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: The art direction seems to be improved upon the original Persona 3, and the soundtrack is immaculate. I have nothing bad to say about the soundtrack. Also, the voice actors add so much charm to their characters, even if the characters themselves are otherwise 2 dimensional. The world space is interesting enough, and the premise of the story sounds fun and enticing in theory.

Cons: I'm roughly 4 hours in, and so far my experience hasn't been very engaging. The pacing feels rushed, the writing is mediocre, and the way the characters are introduced provides no emotional weight to the player. Instead of getting to know them, the game basically drops them in your lap and says ""these are your friends now"". And without building up any real reputation, everyone automatically acknowledges you as a competent and trustworthy person despite having done next to nothing to deserve such treatment. As such, the social links feel shallow and contrived, and I felt no personal connection with ANY of the characters I am meant to interact with. As for the combat, it's... mediocre. The shadows have a decent enough design, but... There isn't enough variety for the early stages to make combat interesting, and Tartarus itself is even less interesting. There is no sense of urgency for the player to pursue the mysteries of the Dark Hour, there haven't been any antagonists to drive the story forward save for the few shadows you engaged very early in the game on the rooftop, and I'm largely bored with the main cast so far. They don't feel like characters. Just one dimensional plot devices that tell you where and what to do. Maybe I shot myself in the foot expecting them to provide more than just exposition after introducing myself to the franchise through Persona 5, but so far they are the greatest disappointment I've experienced in a long time. I REALLY want to give this game a chance, but I am SO. BORED. Maybe I'll give it another hour or two of gameplay to see if the story shifts from Exposition to Rising Action, or for the ""characters"" to get more interesting, but if it doesn't, I'm going to have to decline recommending this game. The premise is there, but the execution falls flat for me so far.",1707107442,1707107442,False,4,1,0.454768478870391846,0,True,False,False

2161700,157626331,76561198405221478,0,2,1335,597,629,1708651472,"So I've played P3R for 10 hours straight as of writing this; That should tell you enough. For those that do need a further explanation, here are my thoughts.

Wow. Great game 9/10, too much water.

But for real, this game is amazing. I played P3P to this point too I believe, just before the first boss if I'm not mistaken so that would be a little earlier than I am now. And MAN, am I glad I picked this game up anyways. The QOL features are really great, and everything screams ""worth it"".

First off, the usual. The music is great, shocker I know. I kind of expected to not like the music because of how great the original tracks are and how used I've gotten to them, but they just blew my expectations straight out of the water. Every damn second in this game feels so good because of the music, particularly walking around at night. No clue what this new song is called but DAMN this has to be the best song in the Persona franchise for walking around. The new battle theme is also top-notch. I like how its chorus is on a little quicker than Mass Destruction's, because it feels more natural with the flow of combat. The music does change kind of abruptly in my opinion, both in and out of combat. And how could I forget, the opening is of course incredible, as always.

Secondly, the overal atmosphere and UI. To get the obvious out of the way: this game's presentation is not on the same level as Persona 5's. That's completely fine but just something that you should know, so you don't go in expecting something ridiculous like that. Instead, P3R absolutely perfects the existing UI. Of course they do take cues from P5's UI, where the MC is the background of the menus, but it's a lot more lowkey and aesthetically pleasing. P5 tried to be (and was, don't get me wrong) really cool, but P3R just feels better in my opinion. The sound design is largely back to how it was in P3/P4, which is amazing as I got into Persona by playing P4. 

As a smaller sub-point of the last, the graphics are awesome. The map feels both new and exciting and nostalgic because of the lighting and just how faithful they remade it. The animations in combat too are great, and crits/weakness hits feel really impactful. It also goes without saying that all the models I've seen so far are great, but it takes one look at the pictures on this store page to see that.

Then thirdly, the actual gameplay. The game doesn't feel too hard, but not too easy either. I feel like they've made it more lenient maybe? I am playing on merciless difficulty so that might be the reason it's still somewhat of a challenge but overall, the combat isn't exactly a cakewalk. The first boss actually killed me twice, in fact, and not to brag but I am pretty experienced with JRPGs so that is quite an accomplishment for the first boss. Slight gameplay spoilers that get explained like 2 hours in: [spoiler] The clock that heals your party now costs the equivalent of lockpicks. 7 of them, in fact. Opening a chest with them can cost 1-3 and you can find them all over the world. Fun system but it is slightly less fun than just having free heals in the lobby. I'm the kind of guy that wants to do the entirety of the unlocked Tartarus in one go because it feels inefficient to not do that. [/spoiler] 
Anyhow, money is actually pretty tight on some days. The equipment is plentiful and expensive, so don't expect to have any savings in the earlygame. Your characters need shoes, clothes, a weapon and optionally an accessory. You can just use the default but that might not cut it on the harder difficulties. I have, for the first time in a persona game ever, actually done a side job purely for the money. Not for stats, not for unlocking a social link, just the money. 
Speaking about stats: P3R only has 3 of them, just like the original. Charm, Courage and Academics. There do seem to be more tiers to them, but I might be wrong. I've currently leveled them all up to the second level. They would be higher, if the questions during the lessons weren't such nonsense. The player is just asked a question, without any explanation or context. I know I can just use the network, but it feels like cheating. On the other hand though, if the game is, why shouldn't I?
Lastly for the gameplay section, the social links. These are back to how they were in P3/4, so there's no perks attached to the tiers, which is kind of a shame but it wasn't my favourite mechanic to begin with. The writing in these has been great so far (both the translation and actual writing), so I don't really have much to say on this topic. 

So that's pretty much it. I'll probably update this review as I play more so yeah, don't stay tuned because no-one is going to actually care about a review for this game",1707106403,1707106403,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I Pre-ordered as soon as the stores went live and played it once it launched, I'm still currently going through the game and taking my time and I love everything about it. They stayed true to the original to the T and I can see the passion and love the designers, voice actors and musicians put into this remake.

I'm happy that I get to experience my favorite game again remade and improved. If you haven't played a Persona game or have started with Persona 5 and want to experience the old stories retold with better graphics I highly encourage you to give it a try. Even if you don't like it I appreciate anyone giving this game/series a chance.

[*]Subtle, but sharp update of the art that still maintains the original aesthetics and vibe - even the overall layouts of the locations. Stylized main menus a la P5.
[*]An absolute ton of QoL improvements - sprinting, quick travel enhancements, direct command of party members, fusion previews for your entire roster at once and the ability to manually pick inherited skills (thank you, ATLUS!), rewind, one button to enter save menu, and the list goes on.
[*]Great new music tracks.
[*]Even more voice acting.
[*]Buttery smooth, frame limit up to 120 FPS, good controls with either KB+M, or PS or Xbox controllers.

Nothing game breaking, but certain levels of Tartarus, The Velvet Room, and random areas on Tatsumi Port Island have dips going to sub 20fps at Medium shadows and RTX reflections off.

As a fan of Persona, it's hard not to compare this game to the original Persona 3 and to Persona 5, as this game tries to be a remaster of 3 with added elements of 5

Is it a good game? Yeah, definitely. Is it worth 70 dollars? Absolutely not. I recommend this game but with hesitation as I really feel like more could've been done to make this better. A lot of the positive reviews are ignoring the flaws with this game because of nostalgia, I wanted to make a more honest review.

This game is marketed as a remake, but in reality it just plays like a remaster. And no remaster in my eyes is worth the price of a full game, ESPECIALLY not 70 dollars (or in my case 100). Even if this particular remaster is well made. At the end of the day, you are still playing a nicer looking PS2 game for 70 dollars. That's just ridiculous.

---------------------------------------------

This game still has the same limitations and problems from the PS2. The areas are fairly small, the battles are fairly limited and are missing a lot of the improvements that P4 or Persona 5 had, it's still very linear. The only difference is now it has crowds of people that look nice, or fancy lighting/graphics. Tartarus looks WAY better now, but it's still very linear and the shadows are annoying just the same way they were in the original, little improvements were made (at least for how far I've gotten into the game).

They also remade the soundtrack, and in my opinion, it is a good remake, but it shouldn't have replaced the original. I would've preferred it was an option to switch between the new and old, or add the new ones to the existing soundtrack. The new songs have a slightly more polished and upbeat feel to them, and to me it feels out of place compared to the feel of the original, they would feel much more at home in Persona 5 than in Persona 3. This part is of course completely subjective.

The game also runs poorly on the Steam Deck compared to Persona 5. I'm sure it'll get fixed, but again, this is basically just a graphically updated PSP/PS2 game, the fact that it struggles to run on the Steam Deck is not ideal.

---------------------------------------------

This game is what the Persona 3 Portable port should've been to PC, for 30 dollars. Not a game marketed as something brand new for 70. It's disappointing. But if you haven't played Persona 3 before, this is absolutely the best way to experience it.",1707089244,1707089244,True,3,0,0.479388445615768433,0,True,False,False

I have felt both tremendous joy and unwavering depression at the hands of the garfverse. This rollercoaster of emotions provided by this prime example of a cart racer peaks above the greatest works of media since man first touched pen to paper.

However these most recent update has been nothing but Mondays. Garfield does not like Mondays and neither do I. I do not question my skill. Gliding past pie and spring taking home first place like lasagna to a cat. However as of late there has been nothing but pain. AI that have unlimited perfume, physics that were designed by a eastern european space program. I no longer can cart with the top cats.

But fear not, I will not waiver. This setback was nothing more than microwaving day old lasagna. There is always the chance to bake a fresh batch. So I hold faith that with the UI updates I will soon rediscover my inner cat and claim my place back in the garfverse.

You may want to wait a bit for it to be performance patched. This game grinds to a halt in areas that have lots of movement or reflections, such as the mall, the Velvet Room, and even Tartarus in some spots. It gets so bad in my case that even on lower settings, going to the mall SUCKS. It crawls. This occurs both on my PC and the Steam Deck. I think in time this'll be fixed, but beware. Of couse, if you have a PC with AMAZING specs, this won't be an issue.

some things are better and some things are worse, its like bizzaro world everything is close to being right but its just wrong. the animations in some cases is REALLY GOOD but then theres so much i come across that just has me just going ""that was what they decided to go with?"" not to mention they really decided to go the generic anime voice actor route for most of the characters so far.
also there seems to be some optimization issues, there are places like the mall that the frame rate drops to like 20fps

I think most people were thinking this would be like what if Atlus took what they did with P5 and did that to P3 but it most certainly is not what happened. I think this game is ls such a good example of the infinite well of ideas that Atlus has for the persona franchise, not just spin offs, but for the actual mainline games as well. I've played a decent bit of the original P3, never beat it because i just have terrible habits to not finish what i start but this shit has me so addicted i think I'm gonna play it like 5 times over before I stop like i did with P5 and P5R.

turn off unified refresh rate in dev tools on your steam deck

download the 70hz mod (on github)

set hz to 35-37 I noticed it couldnt hit 38fps smoothly but 37 is very smooth.

I hope this helps someone

*edit: the difference between 37-40 is very small while the difference between 35-37 is very noticable. Do with this information as you please.

*edit: In velvet room it drops to 20-28 fps which is an issue, fixed if bumped down to 50% scaling but jeez the flashing lights kills the gpu. Steam deck is definitely under the solid 30fps cap.",1706884225,1707066426,True,1,0,0.509803950786590576,1,True,False,False

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

But when Portable came out for Steam not that long ago, I found myself getting bored with the game very quickly. Hence, when Reload came out, I was quick to jump on it, despite the hefty price tag. And I didn't regret it one bit!

Not only is it a big difference being able to explore everywhere in full HD, there were new combat systems and events being added to the game now. The only pity is that there is no option for the female protagonist for this game, which as I recall, is the only route where you can save Shinjiro and Chidori. 

As of this writing, I just finished saving Fuuka, and was able to see the SEES team all decked out in their new combat gear like some kind of shounen justice fighting group. But nice to see those scenes tho. :P",1707058655,1707058655,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Reload version keeps the characters we know and love, as well as the plot and the dialogue of the original game (although the dialogue has been tweaked a bit - just smoothing rough edges more than a major rework), but it adds in greatly updated graphics with a stronger 3D feel, as well as adding a lot of new content.  The battle system is still recognisably the same one from the original game, but it's been tweaked with what Atlus has learned we liked from the newer games as well - the major differences I'm spotting so far are: there's a lot more treasure drops from Shadows; there's a lot more objects to gather; and they've added in a version of the Baton Pass system from P5 (called ""Shifting"") to increase the ease of dealing with difficult shadows.  Other little tweaks include definitely confirming the voice you hear in your head announcing your bonds is your attendant.   I'm looking forward to finding all the other little tweaks they've made to the game as I keep going through it, but so far, this Reload is definitely a positive experience.

So far it's faithful remake to original P3, faithfulnes comes with a cost of welcomed features from later entires. 

It adds completly new ideas and at the same time regressing few steps back in terms of features introduced in later games. One of new features is:
Theurgy, powerful skill specific to character with character specifc conditions to use it,while removing much welcome features like benched party members earning exp or switch party members mid combat
Features like skill inheritance or ability to see fusion forecast are present tho

[b]I'll update this review with complete verdict once I finish the game.[/b]


Game has some issues noticeable in the beginning hour.
There's a word some ppl crashed on sneak attack tutorial but I'm still before 1st combat atm of this review.
Update #1: I didn't crash, more details below

There're some changes in beginning 1h:
- free roam sections in place of/before cutscenes in original e.g you can free roam a bit before entering the dorm (and chosing a name) for first time,
- ingame cutscences like P5,
- dialog changes,
- new intro alongside with it's theme song,
- certain tracks are rearranged e.g Iwatodai Dorm theme
Personaly I think it's on par if not [i]a little[/i] better than original

Worth noting that certain scences or events have been changed e.g ""that"" beach scene. 
There are rainbows in certain places in case you're bothered by it - pins on students bags or painted on monorails.

Update #1: Just reached combat section in Tartarus
There has been certrain very drastic framrate drops in certain places:
- first combat on the roof game stutters slightly when enemies get hit
this doesn't happen later on, only in this place so far,
- upon entering Paulownia Mall for first time framerate drops very drasticly to ~20fps or below 15 fps even to almost unplayable degree
[b]the fix seems to be turning off the reflections[/b],
- Entrance section of Tartarus (the place when you choose part members before going into dungeon crawling etc.) drops to ~30 fps,
-lack subtitles in some places - idle chatter during cutscenes and flashbacks aren't subbed
flashback lack subs due to dialog format (no dialog bubbles like in P5),
- attacking enemies (notably performing sneak attack) during dungeon crawling casues multiple light stutters as game transitions to combat. This might be the cause of crashes for some ppl

Despite those performance drops game is stable for ~90% of the time I would say. 
Your mileage may vary depending on your tolerance for stutters and occasional framerate drops.
Positive review still stands

First and foremost, i put 350 hours into Persona 5 Royal when it released, and i had already played the base Persona 5. So that means i essentially bought what could be the same game with an expansion attached . It was worth every penny. I love Persona 5 with a goddamn passion. Which is why it disappoints me to say, I think Persona 3 Reload is just a lesser persona 5 in almost every way. i was told the story is darker, its not. Its themes maybe darker but PS5 definitely has a darker story overall. Tartarus is just Mementos with rouge-lite elements. And thats not bad but thats literally the only combat. What was good about Persona 5 was the combat was integrated into more than just mementos. In fact mementos was an after thought until the later half of the game which made it bearable cause the real prize were the main story dungeons that werent randomly generated. I have almost no care about getting the social links because all they do is help with exp for fusions. Which is good, but Persona 5 had passive bonuses for every social link which gave you a reason to want to max them all out, as those passives were substantial. I'll make another review once i've finished the game. Maybe im wrong and the story really picks up later and im just judging too early.  TBD",1707029868,1707029868,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

like VAs that may throw you off a bit if you played the old one before, but hey its still good VAs.

They really added new stuff, with the aesthetics and artistically clean look of Persona 5 UI. Some mechanics from Persona 5 like battle mechanics have also made its way into the Reload version. 
There are some considerable changes to game mechanics from what the original was 20yrs ago, yet making it a refreshing new take.  

I would recommend the game to anyone willing to give the Persona series a chance through this game. 
Its worth a try at full price or even on a sale in the future. ",1707024292,1707024379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm happy they added more to do in the slice of life portion of the game since the original was severely lacking in that department compared to 4 and 5. 

I was a little miffed at how much easier combat is in Normal Difficulty but I know that's what hard and merciless is for if you enjoyed how much more challenging the original was.

I booted up the game and understood that with a change in hardware and presentation, the graphics would be different especially with almost a decade between it's original design and the current make...

BUT WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED?!

I just watched the scene where The Main Character and Yukari encounter [spoiler]the first Full Moon Shadow[/spoiler] and the whole sceene feels... Soft? Floaty? Underwhelming? Heck, they also [spoiler]render Yukari useless by bashing her aside before she can use the Evoker, in P3/FES she managed to use it twice before being removed from combat. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DEMONSTRATION THE MAIN CHARACTER NEEDED TO KNOW HE HAD TO USE IT![/spoiler]

This was supposed to be the big 'HOLY COW FECAL MATTER!' moment that makes you understand that the item is not JUST a gun and sh!t just got real, instead it's more like watching an admittedly beautifully executed ballet and the next motion it about to start.

I will still play this game and I may change my review later, but I would caution anyone who loved the visuals of the Original game to maybe wait until this goes on a sale...",1707016089,1707016465,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They give us nostalgic bgm and story that makes us want to play more (I already play 19 hours since I buy this game *i have no life*). They add a lot of feature to make this game better from the original but don't waste original unique gameplay. And man oh boy a lot of voiceline they add to make the story make so much better.

Buyers beware - Do not buy the Deluxe Edition - It's pointless. There's been mentions of being able to rip the soundtrack but it's not official. It's not a simple download or ""click here to access"", heck the app doesn't even have an official way to leave, you have to Alt + F4 to close the app. Consider either the Base or Premium Deluxe versions as these are the only ones worthwhile. Or do your research on how to rip before you walk in willingly. No idea on the Artbook though, I only cared about the OST.

[h2] Review [/h2]
Now that I got over the mess that was my launch day experience, mostly my fault but a save file being locked off because of missing pre-order DLC I couldn't restore after refunding my game to get a cheaper copy was just icing on the crap cake at the time... Now that I've had time to sit down and take my time, I'm updating my review from Negative to Positive. Huzzah!

Persona 3 Reload is the latest main-line entry to come out of Atlus following the glowing standard that is Persona 5 Royal. Alot of people are going to hold this game to P5R in terms of gameplay and features.

[h3]Tartarus is NOT like Palaces.[/h3] 
Perhaps the biggest thing - If you know anything about the previous Persona games (speaking mostly of 3 and 4, I don't have experience with 1/2) you'll know the dungeons are randomly generated. This lends to what could be considered a rather boring and uninspired design. And when you compare it to P5R's well laid out Palaces, yeah, Tartarus is pretty plain and barren. But P3R is recapturing a game originally out on the PS2 so naturally there's limits and creative liberties when overhauling a classic amongst fans and ultimately the game that set in stone the Persona design people have come to enjoy for almost 2 decades. 

As a result, making Tartarus like palaces just isn't feasible and shouldn't be taken as a negative - The whole nature of Tartarus is that its ever-changing, 1 night will never be the same as the last in regards to story so randomly generated remains relevant beyond ""Ew dated game design"". Does that defend said game design? Perhaps it does but in an age where we've seen tactics and mechanics get overly complicated or generic like your average open-world action adventure, returning to something like this isn't necessarily a bad thing. I may go as far to say, it's refreshing even... Why? Travelling a labyrinth with limited resources with no way out but pushing forward hoping to find a teleport point as you're running out of SP/supplies can be a thrill, games play it too safely these days and having a randomised design, the threat is ever high. Upto you if you're on board with that.

I'm only about 6hrs in so I've yet to see the first key story moment following the basics but I think that was probably the biggest intrigue of how Tartarus compares to Palaces - Simply, it doesn't. It's not supposed to.

[h3]A Darker Game[/h3]
P3 in general is known for being a darker game in tone, aesthetics and subject matter.
P4 is all about solving a murder mystery by becoming friends, believing in them to overcome adversity and discovering yourself!
P5 is about sticking it to the adults, changing their hearts to better the world and by extension, the lives they touch. Adolescence rules!
P3? People are becoming husks because shadows consume their minds in the inexplicable 25th hour of the day and you mean to put a stop to it by shooting your own headmeat to summon mythical creatures to fight. Just a little batsh*t nuts. Only a little.

P3R retains that sense of gloom amongst the stars even if the formula is about as you expect if you've played a modern Persona game; 
Living a glorified highschool life by day (seriously, the Highschool is on a damn island ffs) to headmeat blaster by night.

There's strong imagery for Death that when booting the game up, you're greeted by warnings for the kind of game you're in for. P3 tone and story is something that wouldn't come out today as objectively, it hasn't aged well with the heavier emphasis on mental health today - whilst a good thing make no mistake, the human psyche is still an intriguing plot device as we can all relate. Today people are snowflakes getting upset or offended over the slightest thing - case and point, the community page for this game. I'd like to believe Persona fans are better than this and it's just a general influx of interest from Tom, Dick and Harry but if you ever find yourself on a break and you want to be amused, give it a nose. So many people whinging... No idea what's wrong with 'em.

[h3]Style and Music[/h3]
Persona games are completely anime based if you happen to have never seen a trailer. Persona has even been touted as the ultimate anime game. I'm pretty positive an outlet gave Persona 5 that exact tagline when it originally came out and I agree that Persona is perhaps the cream of the crop when it comes to anime inspired titles. I.e. there's a lot of junk out there. 

When it comes to style, it's subjective. Atlus tends to have alot of it but it's an opinion if you're on board or not. For me, I think Persona 3 Reload looks fantastic and fits the tone of the journey - The world has something terrible happening underneath with evil lurking in the shadows being pretty heavy on shadow detail and its blues and greens. I'm a huge anime fan to boot so naturally, I'm all about this.

Music in the original game is fantastic and it's great here too - I've stopped to jam out and jiggle in my chair several times to the remixes introduced, the night time theme just walking around is perhaps my favourite but I knew that coming away from the trailers on their ending sting. It's just so damn GOOD!

‚ô´ Another wander in the niiiiight, let me paint the view... ‚ô´

Persona games are known for fantastic music and it's no different here - Again subjective as I've seen people pleading for the OG music for mods which is fine but alot of the soundtrack is already in the game so... Eh. Change isn't for everyone, power to you, opinions afterall - I hope it happens so we can all enjoy the game.

[h3]Sub vs Dub[/h3]
English dub is fine but that's coming from someone who never got into P3 originally so I have no well founded pre-established connections with these characters to compare and dispute - In the defence of those upset, if they ever do Persona 4 Reshaded and change the English cast, I'd probably have pitchforks at the ready too... so I sympathise with you all. 

I'd argue the Japanese VO is superior and to my understanding, it's also the OG cast so go figure I guess. Pity the subtitles are specifically for the English dub word for word and there's no toggle or automatic change when selecting Japanese audio. Whilst the general story gets across, listening to the JP VO, the expressions just aren't captured well in the subs. I by no means speak Japanese but I've seen plenty of anime to know some basic terms to where I can hear some basic discrepancies that misconvey what a character is actually saying. For me, this is a little jarring. I'd like to see an update for this or a mod but I doubt it's a big enough problem. Maybe I'm cuckoo but that was my observation. Play whatever works for you.  

[h2]Overall[/h2]
If you've played P5R and are jumping in, you already know what to expect gameplay wise and may even find P3R a bit drawn back by the lack of variety in mechanics but the story and tone will take you for a ride and afterall, it's more Persona - What's not to like? Enjoy visiting the game that established the foundations!

If it's your first time, welcome! P3R is a nice place to start albeit it being the darker of the esteemed trilogy most people look at when it comes to this franchise. You will more than likely join the crowd that claim P3 as their favourite as similar to Final Fantasy, more often than not, your first is your favourite!

-Minimal hand holding, unlike P5 which was handholdy and tutorial spamming to the extreme. Reload has more hand holding that Persona 3 Portable but not by a lot.
-Actually decent balance. Around the same difficulty as Persona 4 Golden instead of being unbalanced and piss easy like Persona 5 Royal.
-No annoying, tedious, zelda-like dungeons like in P5 filled with obnoxious puzzles and tons of mini-cutscenes every 5 steps interrupting the game's flow.
-No broken and unfair negotiation system, just the tried and true shuffle time.

This game has an amazing story and extremely fun game play. Only one flaw has been made apparent in my playthrough so far and that's the performance in certain areas. I am playing on a Steam Deck (v1 $400 release model) and two areas in particular, palowana mall and the entrance to tartarus, the game's main dungeon, lag the game TREMENDOUSLY to a sub-10 FPS level. Turning off ""reflections"" in the settings helped the lag somewhat going from literally unplayable 1 FPS to barely tolerable 10 FPS, but the ONLY way to fix the game on Steam Deck is to go into the UE4 code and fully disable ray tracing, which is what causes the lag issue on proton. Sadly the game offers no in-game option to turn off ray tracing, which would be highly appreciated in this game as an patch or update. Though the lag doesn't matter too much since this is a turn based RPG and the areas it effects have no enemies or danger whatsoever. So while I would rate the game positively, the ray tracing issue on proton needs to be seriously fixed and that should be the top priority for Atlus rather than starting pumping out DLC.

I would've bought it for half price on Gee tu A.

Not worth $70. 
~~the review may change as the game is played and/or patches/fix's release ~~
This is not a Remake it is a Reboot

~~Atlus: ""we are not adding FES and FemP into the game because we want to stay true to orignal P3.""
-5
~~Atlus: ""we are changing scenes, we are changing how the battle system works, we are deleting scenes and we are adding new scenes.""
-20 (what happen to staying true to P3?).
~~voice actors are doing their best but will never live up to the orignals(that should have been returned[waiting on mods]). 
Healther / Yukari sounds like she read the lines but not the script so every thing cuts in at the wrong tone/pitch.
Dawn is great as Lilac and Marnie but original Aigis voice is a classic
I switched to JP voices because Zeno sorry you were a super great Cyborg but not so mutch as a Junpei
-10
~~katrina leonoudakis was higher'd to ""localize"" the script even though Atlus already had multiple perfectly good english scripts.
-75
~~The Game hud is really not good... blue is my favorite color and i never thought that this would strain my eyes from a hud that is done so.. cluster-ducked, The text on Pause menus is difficult to read due to its slanting/overlaping and i do not know why you would change it especially battle hud it is so fugly. this is not P5 but P3 so make it closer to P3 please.

~~The game soundtrack is alright, the new girl does vary alright but i can see why people prefer the orignal girl.

~~Unreal Engine Problems...Holy Midnight Shazbot their is ALOT of SCREEN TEARING... ""the only good video game engine that"" -A Egotistical Envious CEO

~~Its shiney, Tartarus does look pretty good

~~FES and FemP will either be a DLC or a re-release as a ""new game"" at full price later as Persona 3 Reload Fes and/or P3portable and/or P3RFesPortable and will charge full price for them too
-10
~~Full price for this game.. wait $70? thats full price +$10..

Everything can easily be fixed if atlus actually worked on the game proper on the JP side and did not higher idiots to mess with the english side.
If atlus doesnt fix, Mods can.
Ill be honest.. i would consider P3FES and P3P(normal not HD) superior.
I would Like to see a P3/P3FES along with Q/Q2 HD release on steam to this but at the moment its only playable via PS2/PSN, 3DS for Q/Q2 and all emulation ... wait Atlus D-listed P3FES off the PSN? or is it locked to disc ps2 and psn store ps3?

All of the DNA of modern Persona games come from this game and this game was the only one so far which did it right. The way the calendar works, social links and so on are all carefully intertwined and all the additions from Reload makes the experience even better.

It's also the first Persona re-release with a decent difficulty curve. Yes the new content makes you stronger than in the original game but there's also new difficulty settings to account for it and they are pretty challenging from my 15+ hours experience.

It might be the best remake I've ever played (maybe tied with Xenoblade Chronicle's).

On a serious note, It's a remake of a PS2 banger without the PS2 jank. I would have been happy with just that, but this game feels fresh and holy cow does it look GOOD. Looking out of Tartarus at a sea of blood through the window, the moving clocks and eerie lighting, full blossoms swaying in the wind out of the school windows. I'm not normally the sort of person to mention graphics at all, so the fact that it impressed me that much says a lot.

The mechanics removed a lot of the punishing aspects like fatigue and bringing the 1 More / Follow Up system more in line with the later Persona games, as well as Direct Commands for party members.

As someone who really struggled with the age P4G was showing (even though I loved the game, mostly for the story and characters), P3R is a massive improvement. The combat system has been improved to feel much more fresh, cohesive, and smooth than it did in P4G. In addition to the combat system, some of the systems and mechanics I sorely missed moving from P5 to P4G have been implemented into P3R which makes the game feel updated and modern. Unfortunately, much of the dungeon exploration doesn't seem to have been improved on so there are times when the dungeons feel incredibly lifeless and empty. 

There are many instances when P3R shows it's age, but I think in these moments the game does so in a good way. Even though a lot has been updated, the game succeeds in delivering the comforting, nostalgic feeling that older games should provide. 

Overall I would say that P3R delivers the ""old school"" feeling that P4G gave, but without the frustrating and outdated mechanics. Another way to put it would be P5/P5R felt like a brand new car; sleek, modern, and easy to drive. P4G felt like a vintage car; classy, nostalgic, but difficult to drive and maintain. P3R walks both lines almost perfectly (looking at you exploration system :/) and feels sleek and modern without sacrificing being classy and nostalgic.

I first played this on the PS2 with the extra FES disc and all. I couldn't get very far, not because the game is hard or too complex, but because the gameplay loop was boring and the tartarus was akin to watching paint dry. I can't count the number of time I fell asleep and the reaper caught me. The music wasn't all bad, but the dungeon music was the worst offender.
This was somewhat fixed on the PSP version, which I loved. Allowing you to change the BGM at will. The POV was also a little bit better in the dungeon. Cool additions but also less-than-fun rebalance. it wasn't made harder, it was made easier. An already easy-ish game made easier. I cleared it on merciless about as many time as the reaper caught me in the original.

Now this Reload version. Like I said, I wanted to trash on it, to call it useless, worthless and all that. Well...

The visuals are astonishing. Not realistic or Call-of-duty-shoot-a-man stuff, but they are far better than even persona 5 (any version) and has better fluidity than I thought possible on my potato computer. The style fits so well I was honestly surprised. Sure, the texture could be better, especially the school, but it's not that big of an issue at this point.
The sounds and ambiance are just as good. While I don't fully agree to the changes made to the music, I can still see the charm and I must admit it fits. I won't take back my word though, the opening is utter trash IMO. I hate that genre. I miss the real ""burn my dread"" opening. Or even the PSP alternative opening. I'm not sure why they didn't keep it, especially when the MP3 player the MC has in the opening clearly shows ""burn my dead.mp3"" should be playing. Call me a nostalgic nerd, I'll accept it. You can also call me a hip-hop or rap hater, it's really not among the genre I can tolerate, 
Now... the big questions.
Is the story good? Well... the main story hasn't changed a bit. other than more pushy localization and more hardcore censoring to allow the gun-to-the-head to fly by more easily... The main story, so far, shows no sign of deviation. if anything, it's even more ""in your face"" than ever... or maybe it's just because I finished the game 100% so many time?
The confidant/social link have been slightly reworked. kinda easier to increase.
the social stats (courage, charm, academics) have been made easier than ever. without even trying I had level 2 in all 3 before the first story boss. It's disappointing. It used to take twice as much to increase each one and now you can increase it without trying. Like... yeah sure I did go to the cafe and studied but... even while focusing on those stats in both the PS2 and PSP version, I could never get ALL three of them to level 2 before the first boss. It's not gamebreaking, and it does make it easier to focus on more important stuff early like some of the social link. So I'm a bit divided on how to feel about this change.
lastly... the gameplay loop.
Streamlined, better tutorial, great additions and all that. Harder to level up somewhat but easier to progress through the tartarus. Floors have been shrunk a LOT, especially the first section. Combats aren't too hard to avoid nor too long to finish. The ""tired"" system is gone so you can do whatever at anytime (Maybe that's part of why they made stats easier to get, it used to be necessary to get a cold from not resting while tired after a dungeon dive just so you could get twice as much stats experience.) Nobody seems to be unavailable other than Mitsuru while they originally often had other stuff to do. Like Yukari used to be unavailable once per week or so and Junpei maybe once per two week. This just means you can probably go into the tartarus when you want to and not when the game allows you to. The classroom questions are the same as before, the average day is spent almost the same as before... The gameplay loop is kinda boring, to be honest with you. it's not bad, just not as thriling as other persona games. 

Final review comment: the addition of light (bless, holy) and dark damage type other than the insta-kill spells with low accuracy from the original and PSP version are probably the best in term of rebalance. 

I hope optionnal bosses can still be found and challenged (from the PSP version).

Is it worth the hefty price? I don't think so. 
Is it worth playing? Yes, absolutely.

Although Yuji's body is male, Femkuna's transient vagina and uterus should still be able to be impregnated by Megumi's potential sperm and upon returning control back to Yuji, Femkuna should be carrying a baby in her Malevolent Womb back in her inner domain

I imagine that time passes differently between the real world and her inner domain, so she's able to raise her child, who we can call Sukumi and has inherited the vast CE reserves of her mother and the precious Ten Shadows Technique of her non-consenting father

As Sukumi grew in power, it became powerful enough to master the Ten Shadows, and when the time came to tame Mahoraga, she was able to accomplish the impossible deed with ease

As time passed, Femkuna discovered new emotions while raising her child, emotions she did not know she had before, a genuine care for someone other than her own self

In time, Sukumi was able to use Mahoraga to give Femkuna a blueprint to adapt to Yuji's cage, unfortunately, since the child was born inside of Femkuna's inner domain, it lacks its own real body, meaning that the mother and child would be separated even if Femkuna took control of Yuji's body

Femkuna bides her time, waiting patiently
Skip past Goodwill, Shibuya and Perfect Preparation, we arrive at the Culling Games where it is revealed that Megumi's sister is actually Yorozu, a crazy male sorcerer obssessed with suckling on Femkuna's four bountiful bosoms

Femkuna takes this opportunity to take over Yuji's body using the binding vow in order to take advantage of a distraught Megumi

Before Megumi is able to summon his divine general, Femkuna converts her child's soul into cursed energy and pours all of that cursed energy into her uterus, which she promptly rips out and shoves down Megumi's throat

Due to their intense sex kaisen earlier in the series, neither Femkuna nor Yuji nor Megumi perceive this as harm to anybody

Yuji could only watch in despair from the inside as his best friend morphed into the cursed child of Femkuna

Yuji has lost his teacher, his classmates, and his reason for fighting

As he struggled to usurp control from Femkuna, the Queen of Curses appears before him in her inner domain, revealing that she was now the cage and Yuji is but a trapped soul, cursed to spend an eternity inside Femkuna's inner domain

He would live forever, seeing everyone around him die",1706976343,1706976343,True,0,0,0.486486494541168213,0,True,False,False

Personally I would say this game is worth purchasing on sale but not for full price. 

Honestly so far my main complaints are the Visuals. The UI design is gorgeous as always but in a lot of places the graphics themselves feel lazy, Some flooring is super hi-res and shiny and the wall next to it will be a texture with no depth I would expect to see in a 2010 era game. For some reason a single animation on the pause menu plays at 15 fps despite the others being at 60. Hell there is a club location and they couldn't bother to have the background/filler characters move at all. they are perfectly motionless, as if they were supposed to dance but just left frozen because it wasn't worth it.

Edit: Just saw some people also pointing out the dorm lighting is messed up which would explain why the dorm felt off to me as well

The game is challenging and antiquated by today's standards but is fair and fun. The music is the best in the series. The story is much more grim and characters are down to earth and less ""anime"" than 4 and especially 5. The themes of dealing with death and apathy are hard hitting while being respectful and the ending is absolutely beautiful. 

It's a shame the game has aged like milk in some areas that makes it hard to recommend to people without patience and tolerance for older game design. Like the boring dungeons and previous mentioned ""antiquated"" combat. Other versions never quite brought it up to snuff with the polish of 4 and 5. FES only gave us an expansion called ""The Answer"" to the story that went largely unbeaten due to an inconstant story and a MASSIVE jump in difficulty to an already tough game. Portable introduced plenty of new content in a Female MC and gave us direct control of party members, however it massively stripped back the scope, design and some of the story in order to work on the PSP.

Now Persona 3 Reload is out. The game I've always wanted, not only as a chance for newer less patient players to enjoy the story and characters, but also for Persona 3 to finally have a definitive version with all the style and quality of life of the later games. The menus, art design and animation are top notch. Dungeons have more things in them, more variety overall and you can dash to get through them quicker. The OST has been reworked and re-recorded with some nice new music tracks that fit incredibly well and are bangers. The new features of ""shifts"" that copy the ""baton pass"" of 5 is a nice little addition too.

What has really impressed me however is how you can customise your experience. If you want to play it like the OG with limited party control and a high difficulty that's an option. if you want an easier experience and direct control over party members you can do it. If you want a mix of both? Go right ahead.

Anything wrong with this remake? So far all i have are nit picks. Like missing the original animated cut scenes style (personal preference), some music while still fantastic has been changed in an odd way ( Mass Destruction's funky ""Babe-AY"" yell is now a flat ""Baby""), and some animated cut scenes have been replaced with just in game models acting out the scene which while still looking great is kinda lame in comparison. Also ""The Answer"" and the Female MC are not included in this as it is a remake of the original release.

Do i care about any of this? Not at all. Especially in regards to the ""missing content"" as i never cared for ""the Answer"" outside of some nice story points. In regards to the Female MC that is a large amount of content gone but Portable recently got a port if you really wanted it. Also FemMC wasn't canon anyway and had some very QUESTIONABLE romance options even for a Persona game so i felt it was necessary to enjoy the game.

I feel like Persona 3 Reload is for 3 types of people: People who never played a Persona game and just want an easy way to jump into the series, people who only played 5 (the weak links) who refuse to play any of the previous ones because ""muh jank"" and ""ps2 graphics"", then there's people like me... People who loved the original for what it is on it's own with nothing else tacked on but would like an update to pretty things up and smooth things out. Persona 3 Reload checks all the boxes for me.

I will update the review once more is played if more is to be said or if things fall apart later on. At the moment however i'm falling in love with one of my favourite JRPGs all over again. If you want a big turn based JRPG with social elements and a fantastic story to sink your teeth into Persona 3 was always a great pick.

Now it's the best it's been since OG release. Now it's one of the best picks you have available. Get on it.

After sinking in 14.5 hours into this game, I can say that it's definitely a great game. It's too early to say if it's the definitive version, but I can say is that it's definitely keeping true to 3 and FES. Even enjoying some of the new additions like 'Shift', and additional SoL events like studying with your teammates. Tartarus feels smoother now, and it isn't such a grind, it's also more captivating since every block now has their personalities, even down to the layout per chunk. The graphics are beautiful and the lighting makes this game feel like it's in '09. Even if FeMC isn't here (and frankly I think it's too much copium people have,) it's still solid. 

My only gripes/peeves about the game is that occlusion view/camera is pretty bad, I don't mind it but you can definitely tell they focused on UE4 than their own engine 'P-Studio'. While battling, it slowly feels like it'll be easier than 3, as much as I enjoy 'Shift', it allows easier techniques to be pulled off. While feeling like some enemies got a nerf, or a huge unnecessary nerf. The only time I actually had trouble was the 'Magician.' Only due to the times it sped up the time. Another gripe I have is that, and this is very minor, so take it with a grain of salt, and a hot take, but I think Kaggy for Akihiko, kinda overdid it, I like the guy but I think he put too much effort lol

Beyond that, the game is really good, it's definitely faithful while also keeping FES content, if anything I feel like they undersold it saying they added minor FES contents. I recommend it to anyone starting the Persona series.",1706948726,1706948726,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

They added a trigger warning for the moment you load the game up in this edition. This was very warranted, and I am glad that it is there for those who do not know what they are getting into. Combat updates give the game's combat system a lot more personality (the combat back in FES was uhh.. controversial to say the least since you couldn't control your party haha). I will say that, for those who want more of a challenge than normal, merciless may be worth doing instead of hard.

I still played the original (okay, FES but that's close enough) so that means something.
This game is just that good. It's probably in my top 3 of all time.

There's a few things to note;
Lines have been changed and voices have been changed. Some characters have a different feel to them and even the music is a bit different. Even so you gotta admit Persona 3 is one of the best video games ever made. This being a remake, it has to be pretty beeping good, right?

The MC's dorm room also drops to around 40 fps with reflections off. Is it playable? Yes, but the stutters and fps drops make for a rough experience so far.

A notable difference from this version of persona 3 versus the originals are that this one does more of its scenes as 3d animations versus 2d like the original does; but it works really well! Its almost a little more immersive for it! That said there are some noticeable differences between this and the source material so if you want a 1-1 this isnt it, but the changes and iterations made are honestly all positive thus far.

The anticipation for this remake has been a journey I've eagerly embarked upon, fueled by dreams and nostalgia that have lingered for a long time.

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Persona 3 Reload successfully captures the essence of the original, revitalizing the cherished narrative that resonated with fans like myself. The visual enhancements breathe new life into the familiar landscapes, and the bits of additional content adds depth to an already compelling storyline.

The gameplay improvements and quality-of-life updates make the overall experience more enjoyable, offering a fresh perspective while maintaining the essence of what made Persona 3 unforgettable. The inclusion of new features seamlessly integrates with the classic elements, creating a harmonious balance that keeps both old and new fans engaged.

However, if there's one aspect that left me yearning for more, it's the option to use the original game's soundtrack and voice acting. While the remake's rendition is commendable, the nostalgic pull of the original audio would have added an extra layer of emotional resonance. A toggle option for enthusiasts to choose their preferred soundtrack and voice acting could have been a welcomed addition.

In conclusion, Persona 3 Reload is a stellar remake that pays homage to its predecessor, providing a fulfilling experience for both longtime fans and newcomers. Despite a minor desire for the original audio, the game's overall quality, depth, and nostalgic value make it a worthy addition to the Persona series.",1706939941,1706939941,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

One doesn't need the DLC to be having fun, as the base game should be more than sufficient to have a good time, even if you've played through previous Persona 3 versions, including Persona 3: Portable.  The ""Shift"" party skill is designed so that it can create stylish ways to take down the Shadow enemies, and often is not required in early battles.  The music is great, but fans of the old versions of songs may have to get used to the new vocals and different lyrics in existing music.

If you love previous versions of Persona 3, then most likely you will find at least one aspect of Persona 3 Reload that you will admit is to your liking.

Feels like i'm playing persona 3 for the first time all over again. I've never felt so happy while playing a game in a minute, last time i enjoyed anything this much was back in august of last year with Baldur's gate 3

 !!Only a few downsides due to the creative vision of the director that kinda diminished the original expression of persona 3, but its by no means a bad game but i still don't understand why the remake needed to be rinsed out like this, and a few tracks also suffer from this ""Creative vision"" as well but i can already tell mods will improve the experience drastically in the near future.

they did good, all except for the director me and him dont see eye to eye. its not a remake on the scale that was needed, as it only added to the problem it was meant to solve but give it 2 years and all the missing content will be added through modding. so it doesn't really matter.

would i recommend yes. 10/10 just because of the combat",1706861399,1706931694,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had the privilege to play one of the original versions of this game Persona 3 FES at the very young age of 9 years old back in 2013. To this day the original version of this game remains very near and dear to my heart. I love all of the characters, the narrative, and especially the world building. The things I admit have not aged the best in this game are the dungeon crawling, and the rather bland visual design. Even compared to other entries in the JRPG scene during this time it tends to look somewhat washed and lifeless in points. The art direction for the original version of this game I personally consider to be very good, but the remake honestly takes it to another level for me. It does definitely boarder more into that Persona 5 territory of art direction which some may not like, but I am personally fine with it. I will update this review with more in depth thoughts once I finish the game, but for now; I would say I recommend this game. It plays well and is a great re imagining of the 2000s era JRPG Persona 3.

Minus some stuttering, it is possibly the most polished game on release by a major studio in months. Which is great because Atlus famously sucks at patching their games post-release. Still, they deserve some praise for not treating their customers like free beta testers in today's late-stage-gaming industry.

The music is fantastic. I played Persona 5 and 4, which also have great music, and it looks so far like 3 has some bangers as well.

Never played the original so I won't know what I'm missing from the post-game. I also don't know what the original pacing or atmosphere was, which is great because I have nothing to nitpick compared to the first release (though some reviews say the original had a more ""spooky"" vibe).",1706924179,1706924227,True,1,0,0.518828451633453369,0,True,False,False

Persona 3 has always had an amazing place in my heart. It's one of the most influential games in my life, and I can link it to my own creative process, writing, and tastes. It's one of the most beautiful stories and tales about friendship, death, and strength in any media.

RELOAD is a fresh repackaging of the original experience. That's not bad, it's actually very good! It twists expectations of experienced veterans like myself, while making the daunting task of Persona 3 welcoming to newcomers. All the visuals, audio, voice acting, and combat is a visceral, and surreal as ever before. The characters feel more alive and real, with their struggles just as vivid.

If you've never played a Persona title, here's where to start. This is the height of the entire franchise, and a should be a staple in ""Greatest Games of All Time"". It will always be in my top 5 games, and is why everyone should attempt to play it, anime fan or not.",1706920964,1706920964,True,1,0,0.496124029159545898,0,True,False,False

People who came in with P5 will also enjoy it and are in for a fast opening ride when you compare the two. P3 gets into the school life/dungeon crawling segment way faster then P5 or even P4.

On the port side, its runs very well. Graphical options are the minimal for most japanese games but it has support/button layouts for the big 3 and keyboard support.
