+ THE PES game ever produced (Well, they cut the PES title and change the direction to online-competitive football game)
+ Massive community support. (You can play the current season with mod/patch)
+ Still the Lastest Master League mode.
+ Overall gameplay is unmatched.

= The graphic is exactly the same with 2020.
= Not significantly improved gameplay. (Personally, prefer 2020.)

- No longer available for sale (just... why?)
- Optimization is painfully bad(Eating CPU like hell).
- AI FOUL is an absolute bullshed.
- Online play is over.

You'll just have to wait until an actual good football game comes up. Efootball 21, along with other modern football games, is utter garbage. Scripting is ridiculous. You have minimal control over the game, and that is being generous. The game has a scenario for matches for what is going to happen and everything that will happen the game is designed to serve this scenario the game has pre-calculated. There is genuine bad intentions here. Football game players are used to the games being scripted at this point. But because Konami has some of the worst programmers out there, they failed so miserably at hiding it. Everything happens so blatantly and they didn't even bother trying to make the scripting fit into a context. Each action that occurs in the game has a predetermined result and how you will act barely changes anything. This will be even more obvious in BAL mode because you control a single player and you can easily observe how things happen. There will be times the game activates some sort of a toggle for a certain time period and as long as this toggle is active, your player will not be able to receive the ball no matter what. Your teammates will pass to unrelated locations even though you stay stationary, your player will fall down just before receiving the ball for no reason, the opponents will foul you and the ref will award the foul to them, you will tackle the ball from the opponent, but your player will trip over nothing and lose the ball et cetera. Each position's result is already determined, there are barely any instances that happen spontaneously. When your teammate gets the ball, the game already knows if the player is supposed to lose possession or not in that position. If the game dictates that he will lose the possession, then nothing will change. If you pull a nice move and manage to get the ball before your opponent, then your next pass will go directly to the opponent no matter how you pass it, because in the memory the game sees that in that certain time period, your opponent is supposed to have the possession. These are only a fraction of the scripting. Do not buy it.",1699307717,1699307717,False,3,4,0.543396234512329102,0,True,False,False

- game pace feels great
- Looks decent enough

CONS :
- HEAVILY scripted. CANNOT emphasize that it enough!
- Lower rated clubs play WAY above average.
- Getting a ""clean sheet"" is the most impossible feat to achieve.
- Player controls during ""scripting events"" are ridiculous
- refs are absolutely broken. Most of the fouls received aren't even called, and play-on's are more often a hindrance than an advantage. Your ""fouls"" on the other hand are hilarious to the point of frustration
- This game is more 'work' than it is fun. Winning or losing should NOT be this stressful

This game is not rewarding. I'd argue and say it isn't fun. No matter what you do, whatever players you have or put in, nothing will beat the 'script' if it is time for it to happen.

It was the best during the time and still has the replayability.. Of course PES jinxed it up with the next game and they lost out to FIFA. 

This is the best PES game till date and they stopped giving support or updates as they wanted everyone to move to the next PES. They just killed a golden goose..!!!

But still PES 2021 has a special place in my heart and reminds me of the time spent destressing during the lockdown times.. The clubs are the best and you can build or break up your players from the youth club..!!

Simple overlays and good ball physics is the best part of PES compared to their counterparts..!!

I swear, with every release, the autism of the AI is cranked up even more. Players losing the ball like they don't give a sh*t, clueless defensive line, attackers shooting the ball with the strength of a newborn when you crank it to the max, passes that just go to the other f*cking side of the field even though you slightly touched the button. What in God's name is happening?

You are better off losing your money on Doge coin rather than paying for this garbage.

Later edit: Even with the release of eFootball 2022, PES 2021 is still utter and complete garbage. Both releases can shake hands and go f*ck themselves, Konami can suck on my nuts for f*cking up yet another franchise.

This game looks great, and there's some nice features to it, but the refereeing is terrible and the sloppiness of the players is infuriating. Every 50/50 challenge results in a free kick for the opposition, whereas I've managed to go several games without even getting one, despite being on the end of seemingly identical tackles. I've been playing football games for years and this is the first time I've ever asked for a refund. There is a lot to like about the rest of the game, I like the master league format and the training drills are good mini games, but that one fundamental aspect being implemented so poorly makes all the good parts irrelevant. I'm not massively into playing online or the 'iconic moment' stuff, but I didn't get the game for that, so I can't comment on it. I just wanted to play the master league with some consistent refereeing!

UPDATE:
Since, according to Steam, 2 hours is the time limit for a refund (understandable for small games, not so much here), I reinstalled the game, since I wasn't getting my money back, I thought I might as well give it another chance. I decided to try the 'Become A Legend' mode, which was a mistake! This might be the worst implemented game mode in a game where they've got so much wrong already. For a start, you don't get a choice of which club to start at, not an immediately obvious one (I actually opened the game up again to check before posting this, there's definitely no choice) . Want to be a legend, starting in the premier league, I hope you're a West Brom fan! (I am not, I support Villa, the last thing I want to do is waste the first part of my career at a rival club) . If it was at least randomised, at least I could either reset to get the team I'd like to play for, or at least one I won't hate playing for. If it was justified by saying ""but new players generally don't get much choice of which club they start at"", they don't choose which team to beg for a transfer to either, but that also happens here. 

 So, anyway, let's just start in the championship. Fine, Wycombe, let's go, and let's not take this seriously and make a giant of a player and have him be a target man. What's this? This giant, brutish man can't win headers against men half his size? He gets lots of practice, since your teammates are constantly pumping it upfield, to the opposite side of the pitch from where you are. Wait, this time, I've recieved a ball to feet, with back to goal. Now if I can just take a quick touch and turn, I'll be in. What's this? My man is taking a year to turn around? Maybe it's because he's a giant, but this also happens with springy, athletic players, so I'd say it's just more that dribbling is awful. Every player has the rotation speed  and turning circle of a fucking planet (unless it's the computer playing against you, of course, then they have a lightning touch). 

 The reason I logged as many hours as I did was because I really tried to see if it was me. I expect to lose the odd game, but I at least expect a chance. That is, a chance without either lowering the difficulty and winning 5-0 at Old Trafford with the standard Villa team, or Jack Grealish having all the ability of Habib Beye, even against much lesser opposition. Seriously, why have football games never got the concept that turning the difficulty up is supposed to make the opposition better, not turn what were godly paragons of the game in one match into a hungover pub league team in the next.

Maybe other players having this issue are in a similar place. Maybe they support a less fashionable team and the big team bias is still a curse of football games. Maybe all the people posting positive reviews play as elite teams and see no problems. Maybe they've only been playing football games in recent years, and weren't around when football games were actually good (yes, even FIFA!). Maybe the problems really are with us... Nope, it is genuinely fixed. I actually nerfed the squads of the elite premier league teams, and they were still getting the rub of the green in every way. The game takes no notice of player ratings and squad chemistry, it just calculates that the elite teams have an advantage. Your players make mistakes all the time, are second best in every area, and players on the other team with ratings in the low 70s are running rings around my team now full of superstars. If that doesn't prove they have a bias programmed in, I don't know what will.

But it's pretty telling that a frequent comment amongst even the good reviews is ""there's some problems, but it's still better than FIFA"". Being better than that turgid shite is not hard, and this game is still not good. PES 6 is better than even modern FIFA games, saying this is better than FIFA isn't even a review of this game, it's a review of FIFA. Between this and FIFA, I'm genuinely losing interest in football games. Damn Konami, you've managed to kill a nearly 30 year hobby!",1619032916,1657994976,False,28,1,0.695061624050140381,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Clothing mechanism is not that good, like the jersey and pants are rigid and not loose or moving like in real life. And secondly, it is hard time for KONAMI to add Indian Team, League and Players to the game because a majority of the players are from India and who wouldn't want to see their National Team and players in game? Great work with the game but it's not always technical, and sometimes emotional, so the only thing, I and every other Indian player needs from this game is our Team and our Players.

But sadly what i want to play is the Master League, and this is where the problem lies. 
The main problem in ePES2021 is the AI feels scripted, especially at higher level. 
Player Ratings wont matter, because AI will intercept all your passes, catch up your most agile strikers, the keeper will mostly saved the most difficult shot you made, and never get a card from a mean foul, never offside when the enemy strikers already infront of your defender, etc etc. 
You already 4-0 lead at the halftime and guess what, the AI defeat you in the second half with most of your defender just dissapear into nowhere. 
But if you lower the difficulty the game felt too easy 

I guess that's why they made ePES, because the developer didn't seem capable to create enjoyable AI opponent anymore. 

Back in time my Michael Owen of England in Winning Eleven with 9 rating of speed, if he beat your defender, there's no way the opponent could catch you
Batigol and Adriano did had the scariest long shot ability
Baggio, Zidane, Del Piero feels elegant when controlling the ball

I am confused. I noticed something in my steam library:
pes 2016 529h
pes 2015 458h
pes 2017 391h
pes 2018 160h

in 2019 i played the demo and the negative changes was even bigger, so i decided to skip a year. But in 2020 there was no change and 2021 was just an update. 
Then came efootball 2022!

I'm going back a step now:

I skip PES 2014 because there was an new Engine - just like 2008.
From 2008 to 2013 there were good developments with the exception of PES 2010 (a disaster). 

Before that was PES 6, often called legendary. PES 5 was problematic because of the referee, 4 was action heavy, 3 rock solid, 2 an improvement and the first part an evolution of ISS.

I played all these parts but something must have happened? I just re-installed 16, 17 & 18 to see - are there any differences? And to be honest: there are hardly any (in short term)! 

At first i thought the importance of online gaming, the competition to EA had hurt the series. I'm not sure, maybe i've changed too. I'm no longer willing to forgive the weaknesses this series has always had. 

After 25 years, i can no longer find stratgic solutions on the pitch. Creativity is no longer in demand, although the possibilities haven't changed at all. Something happened.

very lucky, I've bought this game in 2021 ago, with this last Pro Evolution Soccer series I can play it with my friends, and this is the best football game series in my opinion, it just doesn't have many official licenses...

You cant perform 1-2 chemistry in this game anymore, the player is either too slow for a return pass or perform it poorly. The only way to score in this game is to do a lofted pass and HOPEFULLY the opponent defender will miss the ball and your striker can score. Goalkeeper IQ is lowered, no more insane save, which I think it's a good thing. 

Defending in this game suck too, all you need to do is run toward the ball since 1-2 chemistry is removed, defending now is just about who has better balance, and guess what, your defender always win. 

Crossing is a pain in the ass when you cant perform a quick cross but the player has to take a step back and cross like an amateur chicken on every Sunday league. I'm not sure if it's just me or it's the game design,  but I have extreme input lag. I cant just quick press the button then override it to trick the other player or perform a quick 1-2 anymore, I have to wait for at least 1 second after the player receive the ball that I can do something about it. 

As a long time PES player, I found this game's mechanic suck, but I think newbies will like it since it's easier to score and approach.",1600201376,1647070599,True,0,0,0.513524174690246582,4,True,False,False

There are too many exploits that opponents use that you can do nothing about. Goals can be scored from kick off everything by giving a through ball to the striker. One of one with the keeper? The opponent will do a sliding tackle from the back and won't even get a red card for it. 

When these things don't happen, the games can be satisfying. But the frustration is simply not worth the few moments of fun.

Or just simply buy FIFA.

For now, I am choosing FIFA over this because it is much simpler and better.

PROS : 
- Still better than FIFA.
- I love Online Division better than MyClub. 
- Unlicensed teams and leagues can be fixed with option file.

CONS :
- Everyone is using Bayern Munich in online Division. Everyone want to use big booty of Lewandowski who almost impossible to bodied.
- Online players mostly use the same strategy. One-two pass and run with speedy players like Neymar, Ronaldo or Mbappe. Come on guys!! think harder!! Use your brain!!
- Most players don't want to try high cross and always choose to ground pass from flanks because ""IT'S EASIER TO SCORE"". 
- Matchmaking kinda take too long. Sometimes I need to retry it first.
- The defenders love to make stupid mistakes like bumping each other, too high position even though i set deep defensive line or weird pass in last minutes.",1600268198,1640438884,True,0,0,0.497619062662124634,0,True,False,False

The stadiums of this game look fantastic and incredibly realistic, sadly enough there are not that many licensed. 
Scanned faces of players look very realistic and a big step up from FIFA. The generated faces aren't even close to being as good and sometimes show a completely different person to what he looks like in real life. 
The pitch is not that good looking and too vibrant. As this is the main thing you look at it is quite disappointing that it is not realistic. 

[b]Gameplay[/b]
This is hands down the very best experience I have had playing vanilla eFootball. The previous versions didn't quite feel right but this one clicked right away. The players are responsive, the ball physics are [i]sublime[/i], and it feels amazing to play a long lofted pass across the pitch. 
The collisions could use some improvement as there are often no fouls given as the collision isn't registered as a foul. Lastly the animations of the players are really good and the game engine often comes up with wicked animations to pick up the ball from behind a player or in the air, really good stuff. 
Multiplayer is not advanced, the connection is reasonable but not via servers but peer-to-peer, so the slightest of bad connections will influence it massively. Players are online enough for sub 1 minute waiting times, 
Offline gamemodes are well worked and incredibly enjoyable to play. The career mode features fun short ""video's"" to announce a transfer or a derby match coming up and I wish they explored this further in an update. 

[b]Sound[/b]
It's nothing special, the soundtrack is alright, but I prefer my own music. The crowd is good and brings more immersion into the match. It requires mods to really take it to the next level. 

[b]Mods[/b]
This is one of the largest en best modding communities out there. [b]Every single things[/b] has a mod for it. After installing about 150gb of mods you get every single stadium in the world, nearly all players have a face and all the new team kits are added and automatically selected, 
The graphics look [i]next-gen[/i] with fog mods and an extremely realistic pitch which completely transform the look of the game. 
Even the gameplay can be tuned to your liking to remove the bits of scripting which exist in the base game. 
With mods this is hands down the very best football game ever, [b]9/10[/b]. 

[b]Verdict: 7/10[/b]
The base game has good gameplay and alright graphics, it really requires the mods to take it to the next level. The multiplayer experience is ok, but not on the level of FIFA. 
Offline you have infinite options and terabytes of mods to install and explore!",1613994343,1640136441,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

first is the game speed, i feel like the ball move just a little bit slow than what we used to see, even if you can set the game speed, at online you just cannot
the COM off ball kinda suck sometimes
the UI loading is just too slow i guess
the soundtrack is just not enough in both quantity and quality

I only play Master League because I find the MyClub system more complex than needed.

The game could use better orientation and tutorials in the beginning since I am not versed in soccer tactics and strategies. A lot of the options to manage your team aren't explicitly explained.

They also don't tell you where to setup basic, advance, semi-advance controls and how they work. Or, they don't tell you not every type of shot skill is available right away for players.

Overall, I enjoy the game much more than the FIFA franchise.

PES's mainstay offline mode for lots of people since FIFA has a similar, but much subpar, mode with their player careers. Would you imagine that your 99 rated superstar who has 99 dribbling, speed, and acceleration could outrun and out dribble nearly every defender in the game? Well tough. You're locked, momentum cancelled, fouled with impunity, all because the game just decides a 39yr old defender will outpace a new 25yr old striker who runs faster than the entire team when off the ball, but then you get on the ball and age 70yrs and lose your left leg. This is obviously something that personally bothers me, but the 'spirit' mechanic (or wtf they call their scripting that decides you'll lose your game whenever they want) absolutely ruins moments. At one point I remember forcing the enemy team to score because in a UCL FINAL they were down 12-0 and then the next season I faced the team again in the round of 16 and was down 3-0 by the first half. Same team, same aggression levels, same home-away statuses, same everything and then suddenly a 3 and a half star Swiss team suddenly has an act of god and survives? In what world does that happen? In a world where scripting and poor game mechanics were less important fixes that microtransactions and their E-Sports Scene. Honestly Konami has taken a franchise that once was able to counter FIFA in some places and had genuinely amazing modes that had potential. Fix the mechanics, fix the refs, actually add things to master league and BAL. Stop trying to force an e sports scene that doesnt really exist for this game in the way FIFA does.

It was present for a while now, but it has never actually been that bad. Here, you can literally feel and see, when game decides that you no longer deserve to play it as you want: players become sloppy, they wiggle around when switched to, they respond slower, they run away from the free ball, game deliberatly doesnt let you control the player closest to the deflected ball, defense suddenly drops from 90 rated to 30 rated or something, because they tackle with a delay of 1+ second. When the game works as the fans want - PES is good, but random scripting interacting with your gameplay online and offline is just beyond one`s patience. I`m honestly tired of having dice rolls decide if I m allowed to have fun or should I suffer, watching the game cheat on me or my foes (yes, scripting is so bad, that you can feel it even when your opponents have their bad luck).",1637850909,1637850909,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the best moments was when the commentator said ""it looks like he's been taken out there"" before I even made the tackle. Konami knows that this game is fatally flawed in many ways and the scripting is very obvious. Like players being sluggish when counter attacking while having a half full stamina. I really don't understand how konami is not willing to fix these issues. It has been the same complains, year after year yet konami seems unwilling to face it.

Last minute goals of the opponent, all own players are totally useless in a specific game and are unable to pass, to tackle or shoot - next game everything works. Sometimes the script also seem to be pro your team: you make a very optimistic pass, it get´s through and you can bet that it will be a goal.
Scripting was always annoying in PES, but in this version of PES you get the feeling that what you do with the gamepad and you team has nearly nothing to do with the outcome of the game. And as I said, it´s so totally unnecessary. The game would work perfectly without.  With this bad ""design"" decisions Konami slowly committed seppuko over the last years.

From Fifa, to PES (especially enjoyed the PES1 and PES5), to Championship and Football Manager. I have played them on many platforms like PS1, PS2, PS3, even Nintendo Switch. This is the first football game that's not Championship Manager or Football Manager that I bought for PC.

It has by far the WORST gameplay I have ever seen. It is just ridiculously bad, to the brink of just plain pathetic. I'm someone who likes to play fluent possession football, but this game just doesn't allow for it. Passing is off by miles. The amount of times simple passes like playing from CB to RB are so far off of where they should end it is just ridiculous. At first I thought it was me, but after checking on previous games on other platforms and playing exactly the same way I can only conclude it's this game itself.

Defending is the same pathetic excuse of a game. The amount of times I had a player right next to the ball, pushing on the button to ""stand tackle"" it or to kick the ball away, to then just let it see move by him. I can't keep count anymore. The game doesn't react at all at how it should. Headers go missing, passes go wide, tackling is sometimes completely disappeared. I have never seen a game react so badly (or even not reacting at all) on the input of the controller.

The only upside is that I bought it on sale for like 8 EUR. I've played almost 40h, because I feel you have to give a game a chance to grow on you, but this is just not worth it. It is a shame because I found the PES versions of the game on the PS2 very enjoyable, but this is just a ghost of the game it has been in the past.

Graphics-wise, PES still has top-notch graphics, compared to a similar game (Yes, I'm talking to you FIFA). The only thing that bugs me until now is the fact that PES AI still sucks. Often times my defenders struggle to defend and believe me....It was the worst defensive unit ever since Harry Maguire - Victor Lindelof. Another thing Konami should consider is the player's cursor switching system. Back in the day, in PES 2013, they distinct it with 3 types of cursor switching: Assisted, manual, and semi-assist. Now, the Semi-assist is gone. For casual players, the lack of a semi-assist cursor mechanism is a pain in the arse. 

Is it worth buying? yes, but get in when it's on sale and wait for the newer version.

Pros:
- Beautiful graphics. My PC can run this game although not a high-end PC.
- Stadiums in the game are gorgeous. Player models from LC teams are full of details (you can add faces for unlicensed ones later)
- There are many national teams in this game, especially all of European national teams and some from Latin and Asia are full licensed. (I like to play national teams as well as master league and cup mode)
- Able to use a patch or files to update real logos, kits, balls, competitions, faces, personnel and other things.
- Gameplay might be the same but, in my view, looks smoother than the last one.
- As a result of there are more players than the last one, it's possible to update rosters and others by patch or oneself for 2-3 years ahead.
- Reasonable price if it's on sale.

Cons:
- Sometimes I've felt AI's taken advantage of players e.g. refereeing, stamina, second ball etc.
- Can't launch the game if you have no internet connection. The worst point for me. Players should access the game whenever you want.
- The commentary is boring and repetitive. Looks like developers didn't improve or change anything. (I don't blame commentators but poor and cheesy scripts)

Neutral:
- I prefer single player mode. I don't care about online mode.
- This game might be suitable for players who love to modify, update or add anything in it.
- This is the last game calling PES. I prefer this name and gameplay. No interest in the next installment.

Personally I do recommend to go through the training sessions as I certainly learned good moves to help improve my game. Game is fluent and feels natural and has very nice flow.
It also looks good with very detailed looks. I also decided that the few euro to get the specific team themed game was worth it too. Maybe just don't hide the Quit option in setting and leave it in the main menu :P
However, what I have found and seems a bit strange is that any kind of small trip up is called against me by the refs and any against me are not.

I have played this game for hunderd of hours outside of steam. I'll admit this is my go-to football game because there is not much choice in the football market. However, I got more sadness and frustration out of this game than happiness but I keep coming back for it even after uninstalling, just like a toxic relationship. Here is why this game drives me crazy:

1. [b] Player stats dont matter against the AI. [/b] Your best winger cannot dribble through a random sunday league defender. Your monstrous defensive midfield with high strength cant outmuscle a small joe shielding the ball. While your fastest player will get outpaced by big smoke with 73 speed. Maybe its related to the scripting issue that others have been saying too in other reviews.

2. [b] Referee are bias af. [/b] AI almost always get a call while they can broke your player's leg and run away with it.

3. [b] Freekicks are OP. [/b]

4. In master league, the AI teams will always be a cheapskate and try to offer one of your best players in far less amount of his market value just because he ""past his prime"". Piss off.

5. Player ratings after the game is a joke.

Buy this game on our own sanity risk, or wait for sale.

Overview
The core-gameplay, especially in Exhibition mode, is the greatest of all time. Combined with a plethora of mods from the PC editing community as well as a willingness to train yourself to use full manual controls, this is the greatest football video game ever released, regardless of what mode you're playing. Yes, better than PES 4, 5, 6 and even the legendary Winning Eleven 9: Liveware Evolution.

To be clear, a vanilla installation of this game is really not worth anyone's time beyond casual exhibition matches or offline multiplayer (which, if you can find a good opponent who plays with Full Manual controls, is an immense treat), so be prepared to get your hands dirty modding if you want to experience the true brilliance of this game.


Details
Proper PES fans will already understand that this isn't the game for those looking for flashy menus, expansive soundtracks, life-like commentary and stadium audio. Instead, it's always been the go-to game for those looking for the most authentic virtual representation of football, and Konami's been delivering precisely that for at least two extended periods of time: first in the PS2 generation and then recently with PES 2016-2020. Each of these latter editions has gotten progressively better and there's an argument to be had as to whether the PES 2020 Demo had the best gameplay of the bunch. Nevertheless, there's no doubt that the 2021 Season Update may offer most polished gameplay experience Konami has ever offered.

Yet still there is one massive issue that has held back each one of these recent titles. Whether you want to call it Scripting, Dynamic Difficulty or even just AI Cheating, it is undeniable that any match played outside of Exhibition mode has *something* interfering with what otherwise would be a pure competitive contest. You need not look any further than football supporters' reactions to the European ""Super League"" plans announced earlier this year  to understand how important the idea of sporting integrity is to football. Therefore, having to deal with a constantly changing gameplay experience due to intentionally engineered and concealed game engine manipulations throughout a Master League campaign is truly a game-breaking issue. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the underlying ""pure"" game engine is the best ever developed. 

The gold standard for a football, or any other sport, video game is that the game should never give you an excuse to feel that a loss isnot your fault. That is, the player should always feel completely in control and 100 percent responsible for any positive or negative outcome. Fortunately, the modding community has come to the rescue with a plethora of dt18 and exe edits that take various approaches from setting Team Spirit to 0 in all Master League matches to having the game engine process all matches as Exhibition matches, thus going a very long way to completely nullifying these issues. The result is a Master League experience that has the potential to consume your life, especially when paired with other ML mods that completely remove any hint of licensing gaps.

In addition to these mods, full manual controls will completely change your perception of what a football video game is. If you play football in real life, especially on natural grass pitches, you'll understand that every pass and shot requires a certain level of concentration and technique to move the ball exactly as you want into the *space* you want. This idea of manipulating space, not with your movements as a player but with your passing placement, technique (i.e., elevation) and power, has been nearly perfectly captured by Konami. There's no doubt this requires a some practice (although much less than I originally thought), but the reward is immense. You will quickly realize how simplistic and limiting assisted controls are and how much more rewarding and dynamic their manual counterparts are. If you're still not sure, just give it a shot playing as different teams with varying levels. You'll quickly notice how the game engine feels as though it was primarily designed for manual controls, as things that weren't possible before now feel like second nature, and differences in players' passing ability and style are perfectly balanced between being too pronounced and inconsequential.

Simply put, I believe the greatest thing to ever happen in the PES series is that Konami gave themselves an extra year, not to put together a great next-gen title (let's not get into the eFootball debacle), but to give us the most polished gameplay engine of all time that can serve as a foundation for some breathtaking mods for many years to come. With gameplay mods, near infinite stadiums, reshade presets, etc, etc, I will happily play this game for the next 10 years.",1633451506,1633451506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is realistic to me (but it has its own quirks).

Its quirks include
- difficult in switching player (more prominent in scripted play)
- user players watching ball (even when the ball is coming in his way by accident)
- user players' heading is more difficult than acrobatic kick by AI
- scripted play by AI 
    * you can't do nothing to prevent AI from scoring a goal
    * your CB can tackle but will trip (or CB/GK pass to opponent CF)
    * your AMF (with 99 pass ability) passes to CB or GK
    * your CF (93 rated) kicks the ball too wide on open goal

The above quirks can be overcome by
- a lot of cancellation
- advanced shooting/passing

I played PES from the very beginning until 2014, then stopped and played again this year. I'm only playing 1vs1 local matches with friends. After all these years I expected more. Player movements are not as smooth and realistic as they used to be, it feels like there's some sort of post movement correction that makes players be where they are supposed to rather than where the action and animations brought them. Some animations are really good but some are not and the transition between animations is sometimes snappy.
The physics of player collision is acceptable but doesn't shine. Things like players pulling adversaries by their shirt are nice but visually broken with the 3d models just intersecting.
Overall decent but not acceptable if you think about the whole progress of the game throughout the years.",1629898370,1629898370,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Coach Mode are so bad, you just spectate and choose the attack/defense bar level 1 2 ? lol
- Please tell me what is the player expectations so i can easily renew contract
- sometimes i play the player often as starting and won UCL but still ""The players need to meet 
  expectation to renew contract""
- I hope the master league feature are like Football Manager games XD
- When the player retire, they will regenerate as 16 years old kid and i can buy messi for 40m and sell him at age 31-34 for 120M which is very easy to make money on this master league lolz i hope there are setting, should the player regenerate or random player name just like football manager
- I bought regenerated Edin Dzeko for 35M and sell him for 420M xD

2. add Borussia dortmund bcs i want fkin use my idol, haaland on exhibition not only master league 
    ffs..........

3. This game script is quite funny....
- when my player ran out of stamina and i dont control them, they run normally, when i control them, 
  they run so slow and feel tired.
- Maguire can beat mbappe on 1 v 1 sprint to get the balls.
- The odds of scoring goal against legend is 1/6 shots
  while the odds of legends scoring against you is 1/1.2 shots
- Sometimes the player run too fast if they are close to the ball.
- With max power shot, the ball will always go to air, how do i knuckleball on open play ? or maybe i 
  dont know how ? or you cant actually do that ?

4. Konami server are pretty bad
- Always connection error even i got 97mbps on speedtest
- You cant set game speed which is very boring and lame
- So Laggy

5. I hope they remove the news when you open PES like iconic moment, myclub gacha etc
i dont care bro

6.  sorry for bad london

The A.I. in this game fights you on almost everything you do. Do you want to make an interception? Do you want to run to get the through ball? Do you want to but your player inbetween the attacker and the goal to prevent a shot? How about making an offensive run? The answer to all those questions is no.

ENG:
Not a great simulation but,
More ""realistic"" than Fifa (it's as boring as a true match from the L1) but PES is still animated with a broom in the ass (facial and racing), for example the rig bones of the hands almost never used, almost none muscle animation on the face like in Fifa, which gives on PES the impression of a constipation of the players when they shoot or are tackled.

But there is as much shenanigans (if not more) as Fifa like long pass from the goalkeeper to the Striker with 99 speed close to the defense, which make a goal.

Expect slow game, a ball made in lead metal, players stumbling and stoping like GTA PNJ when you walk to another player, slow player moving like tank, rigid gameplay and not speed sensation like when you watching Mbappe or Son, and animation with very slow timing and rarely immediate action, some ball cant be lost for stupid reasons and shielding is bad in this game.

When you pass the other move weirdly (360 move, still going forward, stopping) you need mostly to do short pass

The player can also lost the ball very easily for nothing; game control are not that great but the defense is more auto and easy than fifa.

pressing is very assited compared to Fifa, now i understand why they don't do the old pressing on Fifa because it will make you catch the ball without effort.

The modelling has an engine that sublimates a lot of things, but the modelling is still very rough on some players and badly proportioned. Fifa caught up on this point when PES was using the Fox Engine for the first time but PES remains the best scans of great players, you can't compare Dembélé PES(scanned) with the one on Fifa21(a true disrespect).

The players with the most details are the players of the clubs proposed by efootball season pack, they were scanned thanks to photgrametry.
But fifa got some details that PES doesnt have, for exemple PES miss tthe tattoo of players while fifa got them.
Fifa also does something  better is the physionomy, you can't compare the shaqiri of Fifa (packed) and PES(slim), thanks to a better modularity for the body model on the Fifa engine, the base model of PES as weird proportion with the hands also.
You can still mod it and make it better and realistic models.

Fifa has a more fluid and fast game, PES is very timed for each action; the animation for the control and such can last several seconds, the handling of dribbling on PES is not crazy.
The players of eaFIFA respond better to the ball and its trajectories with different controls which PES does poorly.

The sound level is better in many aspects of Fifa.

The AI is much more interesting and the players' placements more fluid, that's where the difference takes place, Fifa remains arcade and not very smart, PES favors the collective game and a very advanced game simulation.

The handling is not top in my humble opinion, I always had more affinity with fifa since the PS1 and especially the way of dribbling, the ball protection is auto on PES.

Very few modes unlike Fifa 21, but its strength remains in its style of play and the tackles are real sliding tackles unlike Fifa where the player stumbles on a banana, it's also a less fragility players simulator than Fifa, here, player can still continue after being flicked by a guy. 

The physic changed a lot of things i was happy that was finally put but never tried on fifa or PES but it's a new way to play with very strange problem but yet very cool, i never thought it will be so easy to fall for players even with a tiny touch tho (more falling on FIFA).

My club just like Fut is a cash grabber where you make your team but i feel it's a lesser cash grabber than EA vision.

You can still troll by placing your players in a weird way (full front and full back) and win easily, the realistic way is killed by this kind of gameplay but it's a game.

Both remain very interesting and different, depending on your desire to play seriously (PES) or like to stumble but have fun with others (Fifa) you will prefer one more than the other.

But like fifa Pace is the most important value.

The gameplay is not fun never was but was more slow paced and thoughtful, fifa got more animations and actions for the ball, most people saying PES is better gameplay wise are old players of PES, the true is... Fifa got more fluid actions than PES and more possibilites i'm also an old player of PES (6 was great) but the true is Fifa got more gameplay (and adds) than this old and rigid man called PES who still got the same animations pattern from ISS.

You can unpack the best players easily and with less money than fifa, your players can evolve in skills after match and training and the virtual money can you give lots of pack for exemple 8 euros for more than 10 unpacking of best players like Mbappé and such while Fifa make you pay more than 20 euros for ONE premium pack.

FR:
Plus réaliste que son comparse Fifa mais toujours animé avec un balai dans le cul (facial et course), exemple les rig bones des mains quasi-jamais utilisé, pas de muscle animation comme dans fifa sur les visage ce qui donne l'impression d'une constipation des joueurs quand il tire ou se font tacler.

La modélisation joui d'un moteur qui sublime pas mal de chose, mais la modélisation reste très approximatif sur certains joueurs; Fifa a rattrapé son retard sur ce point; un retard lorsque PES utilisais pour la première fois le Fox Engine, mais PES garde les meilleures scans des grands joueurs, suffit de comparer Dembélé sur PES et Fifa21(un manque de respect t'as peur).

Les joueurs Fifa possèdent plus de détails et traits physiques sur un plus large nombres de joueurs non connus et il non pas une conjonctivite avec des yeux vitreux... il manque aussi des détails que Fifa possède comme les tatouages.

Les joueurs les plus détaillés sont les joueurs des clubs proposés par le efootball season pack, ils ont été scannés grâce à la photogrammétrie.
Fifa fait également quelque chose de mieux, c'est la physionomie, vous ne pouvez pas comparer le shaqiri de Fifa (tassé) et PES(maigre), et ça grâce à une meilleure modularité pour le modèle de corps sur le moteur de Fifa, le modèle de base de PES à des  proportions bizarres notamment avec les mains.
Vous pouvez toujours utiliser des mods et rendrer cela plus réaliste.

Fifa possède un jeu plus fluide et rapide, PES est très temporisé ou chaque action de l'animation pour le contrôle etc peu durer plusieurs secondes, la maniabilité des dribbles sur PES n'est pas folle.
Les joueurs eaFIFA répond mieux au ballon et ses trajectoires avec différents controles ce que PES fait mal.

Niveau sonore ça explose sur beaucoup de points Fifa.

L'IA est largement plus intéressante et les placements des joueurs plus fluide c'est la ou la différence à lieu, Fifa reste arcade et très peu malin, PES privilégie le jeu collectif et une simulation de jeu très poussé.

La maniabilité n'est pas top à mon humble avis, j'ai toujours eu plus d'affinité avec les fifa depuis la PS1 et surtout la façon de dribbler, la protection de balle est auto sur PES.

Très peu de mode contrairement à Fifa 21, mais sa force reste dans son style de jeu et les tacles sont des vraies tacles glissé contrairement à Fifa ou le joueur trébuche sur une banane. 

Les deux reste très intéressant et différent, selon vos envie de jouer sérieusement(PES) ou aimer trébucher mais s'amuser à plusieurs (Fifa) vous aller privilégier l'un plus que l'autre. Fifa reste très bien animé et propose plus de contenu et une maniabilité plus intéressante.

Mais comme dans fifa, la rapidité est la valeur la plus importante.

Technical analysis summary

Graphics: 7.0
Sound: 6.0
Playability: 8.0
Longevity: 6.5
Impact: 6.0

Pro

- Budget price
- All the usual editability
- As always, a more realistic and staid approach to football simulation
- Minor, but useful, gameplay improvements

Cons

- No new game modes or game mechanics
- Interest in online multiplayer drastically wanes after a couple of weeks due to lack of content...
- ...due to a total absence of new game modes and very few online objectives capable of keeping attention and desire of playing high
- Overall, the technical sector needs a breath of fresh air and this has never been more tangible than this year


Overall Verdict

6.7: The usual satisfying and pleasant football simulation capable of entertaining enough fans of football video games.
No news worthy of note compensated by the reduced price, if you have played the previous PES you will have fun as usual and you will even be able to appreciate some minor positive tweaks, but we look forward to the development of the next game hoping to finally be able to see noteworthy improvements.

Yes, it's an improvement to last year but that just goes to show what a pile of trash pes20 was.
- Referees are still absolute shambles. This has been an issue for YEARS, Konami!
- Why do I have to be online even if I just play Master League?
- For the love of god, please remove that annoying opera song that comes on before cup games and derbies!
- Players would not leave their position if their life depended on it ""Nah sry fam can't help you on that counter, I'm a rightback"" and will just stop mid-movement
- Players would rather die than intercept a pass, unless it's your own pass to a different player
- Player selection is terrible! HOW DO YOU MESS UP PLAYER SELECTION?? (EA did this better in 2004)
- Playing on higher difficulties basically turns every opposition sunday league fatty into prime Inzaghi
- How come, everytime I have two of my players in front of me, the one that goes towards my pass is ALWAYS the one thats offside?
- I've seen french cars respond faster to controller inputs than my Players
- Every real-life braindead rat has a better first touch than anyone on this game
- It's ridiculous how much easier it is to beat an actual top team than teams with a bad rating. Barcelona etc will actually attack and try to play. Bad teams only defend but are doing a better job than the best in the world. And if you happen to play on a higher difficulty you are very likely to concede from every counter attack.
I don't really know what i expected for 25€ after last year's game but it was certainly not this, which is sad because somewhere hiding underneath all this garbage is probably a decent game that just needs some fixing

Edit: Data Pack 4
I am glad to announce, it is one of those rare times where a data pack actually improved the game.
The players react way faster to the inputs, which makes the game actually - dare I say it - fun!
This is arguably the best change that ever happened to the game. However, there are still a lot of issues.
- Refs still bad
- Youth system in Master League is still horrible (Please, steal this feature from FIFA). Nobody wants the same youth players for every single Master League
- Player selection needs a lot of improvement, especially for full manual controls
- Free kicks are extremely satisfying, but waaay too easy to score from
I assume they will continue to tweak a lot of mechanics, so everything is set for the next-gen game and if they continue the way they did with Data pack 4, I will definitely consider giving PES22 a go.

Edit 2:
Data Pack 7 is lit. Gameplay has been tweaked very well. Feels more responsive and refs are also improved.
Unfortunately, penalty shootouts vs AI are still more rigged than elections in Belarus. Please fix before I break my controller entirely.",1605211611,1628278777,False,67,18,0.727772176265716553,2,True,False,False

for the player movement and tactical aspect i think this game is better than fifa..

about the scripting and AI difficulty peoples rant about..
In my experience.. yeah superstar difficulty is pain in the ass.. but this difficulty is not unbeatable.. even the legend difficulty.. you just need to feel the football more.. enjoy.. do not rush.. and also you need to learn how defense well.. maintain the defense formation.. calculate the risk of defense movement..
-
imho if you are already habituate in superstar difficulty.. playing top player difficulty won't excite you anymore.. because the top player difficulty pressure will feels so loose.. 
-
now my standard difficulty is superstar..
since for me this difficulty can give me right dosage of fun and excitement..
but yeah to be able to enjoy this difficulty i did a lot of practice and tactical experiment..

what i want to borderline is..
yeah i believe there is scripting..

Visuals are great, but the presentation definitely doesn't live up to the FIFA standard. Commentary has always been a PES problem and it shows. The career mode is a hell of a lot more stream lined in the sense that it can be as in-depth or as basic as you like. The licensed roster is pretty good, filling in some of the FIFA gaps these days. Like most, I would have to say the game-play itself is a win over FIFA big time. Controls are a hell of a lot more responsive with some very nice physics to boot.

Overall, I still very much loved PES and FIFA, they both have their pros and cons. But at the end of the day, I come for a good career mode. These newer titles are more flash than substance in that regard. For a AAA title, not a bad price, especially if you're a fan of the sport.

CONS:
-The movement and everything the players do is so clunky compared to how it used to be. 
-Professional world class players somehow can't take a good first touch
-No one can run with the ball. I you even sprint for a second you get shoved off the ball
-The interceptions are so unpredictable (The ""derp mode"" when everyone is fumbling for the ball is far worse than ever.)
-Free kicks are WAY TOO EASY TO SCORE. If you foul anywhere within 35YDs it's almost a guaranteed goal.
-Strength is OP. Pick tall, high strength players and be prepared to win every single tackle easily. 
-There are game-breaking exploits like being able to BLOCK THE GK IN CO-OP on free kicks. 
-You still can't add filters to matchmaking i.e. Co-op against other co-op teams, not a player with AI team mates. Or play against others using manual controls only. Also you can't just play against real teams. It's always against myClub teams.
-The friends list system and match room stuff is soooo bad. No integration for steam friends list or anything. Want to play co-op? Ok go browse servers and do all this other bs. Just a huge lack of online features. Want to play a random selection match with a friend online? Too bad, local matches only. 
-They give way too much away on myClub. Very few players should have a full black ball team the first week of release if any at all. They make it too easy to get the best players. Why is it that EVERY OPPONENT HAS ALL THE ICONS AND FULL BLACK BALL BENCH?? It would be better to be forced to play with an ok team that is 3-star rated maybe a gold or two. Nope, it's white ball team then straight to black ball right away. This makes it so unrewarding. 
-Player switching mechanics are worse. Like the ball will move through a player right by the ball and it won't let you switch. Changing to manual or whatever did not help.
-Every player online just pings it up top and 1-2 passes thru ball and that's it. That's because it is the only style in this version that gets rewarded.
-You can score off kickoff by sending your passer on a run after kickoff then just long thru and it works 50% of the time because of horrible marking AI on def.
-Still uses peer-to-peer connection, no dedicated matchmaking servers which leads to shit connection and lag.
-Huge amount of cheaters in the game. I come up against myClub teams with the ENTIRE TEAM RATED 109 which is impossible. It would come out to 99 in every stat and there is a training level limit that prevents this so WTF. 
-Nothing else other than what is mentioned above has changed from the older versions. So essentially the gameplay has gone way downhill. Graphics, data packs, and whatnot is pretty much the same as it has been. 

PROS:
-The non-online multiplayer modes are fantastic. I love the be a pro and master league. very fun. 
-The difficulty level on the AI is very challenging as well. Legend mode is actually hard. Scoring against the legend AI is extremely rewarding. 
-There is a great modding community that carries this game every release.

UPDATE: Even in the sanctioned eFootball league matchmaking modes, there are still cheaters. I am up 3-0 in the 90th minute and the opponent unplugs their ethernet and the game disconnects. Says match cancelled due to unforseen circumstances. I do not get a win despite clearly having won the game. They don't get a loss. It is complete bull. This is the competitive ""esports"" mode and this is extremely common. And you can't even report them afaik. Online just really sucks

Passing is broken, especially through balls. How do you break something that was great 2 years before. Heading is broken. The only thing they really made harder was dribbling but that is because it was so easy in 2019. Either you do the grind that is learning everything manual mode or you suffer.

When this game is good is great but then there is the ""difficulty"" levels. Faster pressure from defenders, quicker reaction times from attackers, fast paced passing and beautifully constructed plays is what I expect from higher difficulty settings. PES (eFootball) difficulty is difficult because the opposition can kick you all game long and it's fine, they can dive at your legs, take your legs out, not touch the ball and it's fine, they can tackle you-NFL middle linebacker tackle-tackle you and it's fine. You try to steal the ball, shoulder to shoulder, foul. It's nonsense. 
You are already raging a bit and then it comes the passing. You are ready to put a through pass between two defenders, there is a player hitting the perfect line to get your through pass, your controller stick is obviously pointing to the opposition goal (because that is where you want to pass), you press the through pass button and your player PASSES THE BALL TO WHATEVER GUY IS BEHIND YOU!!!
I really hoped this stuff would not happen in this version but I guess it's ingrained in the game.
Mind you, I played Master League and this kept happening, can't imagine how much I would lose it if it happened against real players.

The game has unrealistic spacing, the players are too far apart, thus bypassing midfield play. 

Every player in the game can do a perfect running tackle without fouling, which makes players like N'Golo Kante less valuable. 

The A.I. seems over-coded there is too many scripts telling the A.I. where to be; (formation screen, attacking instructions, fluid formation, advanced instructions) all of these do the similar things, there is no need to have so many scripts, as a result the A.I. ignore the ball & players in dangerous positions.  

Every team plays the same way, regardless of tactics which makes Master League boring. They need to remove A.I. play sequences & make it a sandbox like Ps2 PES.

Konami need to remove a lot of needless script. They need to include sliders to adjust spacing & player ability like in FIFA. & we need an option to completely disable advanced instructions for all teams. 

Offline players make no profit for Konami so I doubt these changes will come.",1626465565,1626465565,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't recommend playing online since normal matchmaking always takes forever and myClub mode is essentially Pay-to-Play. You almost always get matched up with teams whose players are far above yours and the match is just a waste of time by then. The only thing worth playing is probably the eFootball modes where you can play using original teams. That is, if you can find a match faster than the actual match is going to be.

Regarding offline modes, this is virtually the same game as the 2020 version, and KONAMI clearly were making it that way. It's not a problem imo, gameplay from the 2020 is still pretty good and feels realistic. But the only downside i think is the difficulty scaling. You can play at Top Player difficulty and almost every match you won't get a shot at all against your team, but the moment you play it on Super Star (or Legend), even players with 30 ratings below your players can dribble, pass, and shoot like they're all Messi or Ronaldo, not to mention every pass or shooting you make will be get intercepted or blocked most of the time.

But regardless, PES still has the best gameplay of any football sim, that includes the additional modes like Master League, Cups, Become a Legend, etc. But that's it, most of this game's strengths revolve around the offline modes.",1626012795,1626140212,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Game play gets worse by difficulty level, not be cause of better AI at higher levels but the way your players will change to be more like fridges. When you play with Legend level, game play is unbelievable shit. Your players will get crippled so hard that they take 2 seconds to control the ball, run like walking and every time they make contact with opponent, it's like they are hit by a truck... Opponent defenders run like Ulsan Bolt and do sliding tackle like Bruce Lee, they will slide and lie there 2 seconds before your player arrive to get the ball. 
Your attacking players will not try to move into space but always tightly mark opponent defenders, yes you are reading it right, they always stay close to defenders so that every pass can be easily intercepted, or when they get the ball, defender will close in and they will give up the ball like being hit by a truck.
I hope that they will revamp the game play in PES 2022... this is a total waste of money. This game brought much more frustration than joy... If you let a developer sit in the same room with a player, I don't think that he would make it out alive...

[hr][b]Realism Mods[/b][/hr]: Who experiences PES21 with all the realism mods sees the game differently. Now I can say that I would never play it again without 150GB of mods. Some of the main things the mods add: better graphics, even details like dirt and tight kits, real kits, balls, boots. Lots of licenses, custom real stadiums, better lighting, turfs, fog.  New animations, intro scenes, fans chants, anthems, more managers, full cameras' customization. It's a whole different game. I can't stress that enough. If you enjoy the gameplay a little bit, please go after Mods. Some hours of installations and whatever will pay off. 
(Check KnightMDs' YouTube video at the end of the review)
[h1]Comparing the base game with FIFA [/h1]
[hr][b]Gameplay[/b][/hr]: feels more natural, some dumb and funny moments occur, players seem more ''human'' and less ''gods'' in comparison to FIFA. 
[hr][b]offline[/b][/hr]: both lack depth offline. PES' Master Leagues are fun and remind you of the past, but FIFA now has more customization and content, more stuff to do out of the matches. However, in PES it feels like your formations and strategies matter more, and this is rewarding. In FIFA just buy fast paced players and you're good to go.
[hr][b]online[/b][/hr]: both have problems (like scripting that interferes in matches) and repetitive player cards, but FIFA looks more stable (servers) and has many more players. Also, FIFA's FUT has a big market behind it, so at least you don't feel like you are playing a dead game.
[hr][b]Graphics[/b][/hr]: PES without mods is kinda trash to be honest. Now that I use around 150GB of mods, I can clearly say that FIFA has better visuals, although animations are somewhat unnatural. A nice thing about PES is that if you watch it without Interface and from a Broadcast camera, it looks closer to a real life match.
[hr][b]Licenses[/b][/hr]: In PES: get Mods!!! In FIFA you already have 99% of licensed content from the get go, which is good.
[hr][b]Soundtrack[/b][/hr]: IDK if it's relevant... anyways... the soundtrack is meh. PES should get more and better songs. FIFA games have always had better soundtracks.
[h1]TL;DR[/h1]  
Get PES if you are looking to enjoy offline fun gameplay and willing to spend some hours installing Mods. If you get the full pack of realistic mods,  you will probably enjoy it!!!
Get FIFA if you demand a more polished game from the get go (menus, intros, licenses and graphics), or if you only play online, because it's more established.

[i]Just my opinion. You can check the demo for gameplay and the video below for modded graphics.[/i]

Ive been playing My Club (basically ultimate team) mostly and i love it. Its easier to build up your team, you can level up your players, and its not as big of a grind to get yourself a nice amount of coins (plus you can sim matches thatll play on their own if thats your jam). PES is way more relaxed and doesnt seem as money hungry/greedy as EA. I understand licencing is a big turn-off for some, but on PC it is incredibly easy to upload kits, teams, players and leagues into the game. It only took me about 10 minutes to add the Australian A League, MLS, Spanish 3rd tier, and Englands League 1 and 2. Be a Pro feels a bit clunky and i would like to see more in that part of the game but apart from that, im happy!

It disappears at any level in free play friendlies, but as others have mentioned here your teammates turn into lobotomy victims and your opponents could all play for Madrid. You can outshoot the computer 10-1 and still lose regularly. Ruinously stupid ""catch up"" AI, completely unnecessary as evidenced by the balanced friendlies against the same computer opponent.

On top of that you have the usual panoply of Konami incompetence: no tournament option, a 'quit' button hidden in the options menu, a league that forces you to roleplay as manager whether you want to or not and subjects you to endlessly annoying cutscenes and press conferences. These should all be options, not forced on the player, just as there should be easy menus for league, career, tournament etc.

It seems grooved to try and force people to play online which a lot of us just hate.

I used to by PES regularly going back to the days when you had to get it mailed from overseas, but have only bought two editions in the last fifteen years, due to the basic inability of this company to just get it right.

The game just takes control away from you all the time. Your players will just stop moving and stand still for no reason. The ball will be right next to them but they refuse to take it. They will just pass in the wrong direction. It genuinely feels like I have no control over what happens in the game.

The animations are also incredibly janky. There is no transition between animations making the players jerk around like they are having a fit.

Replays also take too long to skip. This sounds like a nitpick but when there are so many it really wears on you.

When it doesn't -- your AI players play against you (they don't make runs and are generally useless in defense, often providing a clear shot for the attacking forwards by literally moving *away* from the ball, instead of toward it). Switching system is broken -- it switches to the player that doesn't make sense in a current situation, then when you switch from player to player, there's a slight stopping of movement which kills any attempt at defending properly and causes players to be ""pulled back by poltergeist. I mostly play the online co-op with real players (playing w/ the AI is torture as noted above) -- that could be fun when the teams are evenly matched, often times I am playing against much better teams (which is fine) and/or my team is nerfed and players are slower than usual (which is what makes it a bad experience); sometimes kicking the ball takes longer than it should which makes it hard to do quick plays, that's particularly costly in front of your own goal where forwards can just spam a button and easily take the ball. Menu needs to be simplified -- there are too many leagues and it's unclear what league/tournament impacts what rank. In 2021, ""clan"" is probably not the best word to use multiple times to describe teaming up with people. Servers don't work on Thursday in the US which means you can't really play then if all you do is play online. I should mention I mostly play co-op because I can never find an opponent in ""ranked match,"" not sure if that's true for a lot of people. The last time I tried ranked match I was getting people w/ a much higher rank which makes the games pointless. I've had some great times with this game, but I can't recommend it in its current state.

Terima kasih untuk Konami yang baik hati, perkenankan saya menyampaikan sedikit review sebagaimana saya telah mencoba, memeriksa meneliti , hingga menimbang dengan berbagai aspek-aspek kehidupan hingga jatuhlah pilihan saya untuk berbelanja di Steam, semula saya sedikit ragu, tapi saya percayakan Allah mengatur semua apa yang terjadi, takdir jodoh dan rejeki dari awal pengiriman, Steam dan Konami bekerja dengan cukup memuaskan, walaupun saya tidak bisa melihat senyum, bahkan tidak bisa melihat yang membuat game ini pria atau wanita, karna berbelanja online, memang mantap dan top markotop steam ini. tak lupa saya pamer juga ke tetangga sebelah, paman, ponakan, ibu bapak kakek nenek ,om tante, adik , kakak, istri, mantan istri , mantan pacar, kucing, dan kucing tetangga, mereka jadi ngiri dan pengen juga kaya yang saya beli ini saya selalu berkata dalam hati, ini steam memang top, saya pasti akan belanja lagi di sini, sudah saya follow, bokmark dan wishlist game-game dari toko ini buat inceran bulan depan pas gajian, oh ya denger2 gosip lambe turah, katanya syahroni dan girang niji belanja di sini walaupun kadang ada suka duka terhadap steam dan Konami ini. tapi persoalan pribadi dan dendam hanya membawa kerugian bagi diri sendiri dan orang lain, jadi alangkah baiknya saya hanya memberi review yang baik saja bagi saya itu hanyalah asam manis pahit dan pedasnya kehidupan duniawi semoga juga bapak presiden belanja di sini dan di pakai pada saat press kompers di tipi sehingga jadi viral dan laris karena biasanya beliau sekali pakai produk, langsung di buru oleh netijen... sembari melepas penat, bertemankan sekotak kopi instan 200ml , aku install game yang baru aja ku brli ini buat menemani kesendirianku kupandangi dari berbagai sudut, seperti aku cukup berbangga diri. karena game ini berkualitas cukup baik dengan harga miring jika di bandingkan dengan marketplace lain. sesekali aku menangis sembari mengibas asap rokok yang berkepul memenuhi ruangan hampa mahluk hidup ini ini lah game yang ku dambakan, ku impikan bak memimpikan seorang wanita dalam tidurku.. nanti juga insya alloh saya akan sarankan untuk belanja di sini pak putin, mas trump, mbak hilari , mas erdogan, om kim jong un, obama, sby, megawati, prabowow, bj habibi, kakek bush , kalo lagi papasan atau pas ketemu dan perlu juga di ketahui, sering saya browsing game2 di sini di newsfeed, nunggu update an terbaru, serasa nunggu pacar baru, bookmark dan liat saldo bank... menyedihkan emang, sisa saldo tidak mencukupi untuk melakukan pembelian ini.. ya mo gimana lagi... saldo tak sebanyak keinginan yang akan di beli.. terpaksa beli yang paling di butuhkan saja nunggu saya jadi peresiden dulu dah nanti saya borong belanja di sini jadi jangan bosen2 kalau nanti ada orderan dari saya lagi yang pasti saya akan belanja lagi di sini, insya Alloh tapi sebelumnya saya mohon maaf karna telat kasih review, karna saya harus berfikir dulu kata kata yang tepat , cermat dan teliti agar tidak menyinggung steam beserta Konami yang baik hati ini selain itu saya juga kordinasikan dengan aparat setempat tentang penulisan kata2 yang baik agar dapat di terima oleh segala elemen masyarakat apalagi ini menyangkut kenegaraan, dan kebangsaan, karna saya takutnya sebuah saran dan review kinerja menjadi kritikan, akhirnya kita menjadi terpecah belah oleh kesalahan kalimat atau kata kehidupan ini terlalu berarti untuk di rusak oleh dendam. hindari perselisihan, dan jadikan itu adalah sebuah peringatan terhadap diri sendiri . karena sejatinya agama mengajarkan kita untuk mencintai sesama mahluk hidup dan menghormati benda mati.. dan tak lupa juga saya haturkan banyak terima kasih untuk pak rt pak rw, pak camat, lurah, bupati, gubernur, walikota, paspampres, mentri , maupun presiden, juru parkir, pilot , driver, petugas bandara dll yang telah memberikan kemudahan dalam berbelanja, dan tidak memberatkan para pengusaha online seperti ini karna ini semua berkat kerjasama dan keterlibatan mereka , dari awal hingga game ini saya terima .. tanpa peran dari mereka, mungkin barang ini hanya akan menjadi sampah tak berguna di library steam saya.. kadang saya berfikir apakah mereka tahan banting, kerja siang malam , bekerja mencari nafkah , mengirimkan barang , kadang jatuh, rusak hilang dan mereka harus menanggung sendiri kerugian tersebut, di situ kadang saya merasa sedih belum di caci maki pelanggan yang tidak sabaran seperti jenis saya, telat 1 hari kena denda.. banyak hal yang saya fikirkan terhadap keadaan situasi dan kondisi perekonomian saat ini bahkan saham2 yang saya beli rontok ga jelas, walaupun gada hubungan sama steam dan Konami ini maupun programmernya tapi itu berimbas terhadap rutinitas belanjaan saya yang harus tersendat sendat yang biasa beli 3 jadi maruk belanja 10 item, padahal dalam kondisi terjepit untuk itu sekiranya bapak presiden baca review ini kalau lagi belanja sini, di mohon kiranya memberikan kemudahan dalam menghabiskan uang di steam ini. serta meningkatkan taraf hidup para pembuat game agar mereka sejahtera dan mampu beli rumah sendiri serta tidak memungkinkan untuk punya istri sendiri bagi yang jomblo sekian dari saya, semoga review singkat saya dapat memberi arti dari kehidupan di sini yang lain bagi para calon pembeli , serta dapat memberikan sisi positif dan dampak yang baik bagi kehidupan di negara kita ini Wabillahitaufik, Wassalamualaikum Warrohmatullahiwabarokatu

Is it better than Fifa? In some ways, When Attacking, Yes. But defending? There's lots of improvements needed.
-Switching Cursors: (Out of possession) Makes me switch to players that is farther from the ball when there is literally people who are closer to/ in front of the ball who have bigger chance of snatching the ball. Even when using the RS still doesn't help.
- The Jockeys stance when defending is a joke.
- (Sometimes) When one of the CB is out of position, the other CB that should've stayed in the center and cover also ran out of position covering LB/RB. WHY?
- Slightest turn when chasing the ball sometimes makes the player stops as if turning 90 degrees.

For real tho, this is best PES (altho just updated 2020) after many years of some editions that had always some issues, this one is not ofc perfect, AI could always be better (especially when it comes to free kicks), refs are still not really great but way better than before, and ofc pvp and many other modes are good fun.

Def recommending you to get game, also not confirmed but I heard that next PES will be on engine that is harder to mod, and this one has great modding community and lots of mods, so that is also good reason to get this PES!

Myclub is a plague, a cash grab and since its making them money, its the only thing they actually develop. Masters league, become a legend could do with a bit of love but don't hold your breath.

My other gripe lies in the controls, you'll sometimes be standing still to box in the ball and the opponent will swipe it from you, which is fine in itself, but your player will trip over 6 miles (unbreakable animation) as if you were running full steam ahead leaving the cpu to run away with your ball.

If you want some quick fun on easy difficulty, go ahead. But if, like me, you're choosing PES over fifa due to Master League or it's more ""realistic"" gameplay, just save yourself the frustration. I have never experienced such dissatisfaction whilst playing a game.

You'll have a team of 75+ OVRs going up against some 60s in a cup and all of a sudden your pacey winger forgets how to run. After taking a touch, your striker requires 2 days and a light massage before he's ready to shoot. Using gegenpress? NO ONE CLOSES ANYONE DOWN.

playing with friends is ok. playing against COM is reasonable. but not online - few reasons:
1. this game is really massively scripted. if the game wants you to win - you'll win no matter how your opponent try. same thing about losing.
2. there are not so few cheaters in this game that can disconnect with some software without consequences (means you won't earn any points due to this disconnection). very effective for them when they are losing. the advanced cheaters can even disconnect you and it'll considered a win for them and a loss to you.
3. this game is really addictive in a bad way. the earnings you make don't worth the time. really. just trust me on that one.

all that aside - the game is really beautifull and movement feels real as it can get.

- Shooting feels good, with a satisfying thunk when the ball hits the back of the net

- MyClub mode:
- This should be the area of most focus now for online gaming, but lots of issues with matchmaking
- Takes ages to try and get online games, sometimes in certain categories it just times out. Maybe there are no players for the category, but why waste your time ""searching"". Often when there are players to match with it first cycles through trying to find players very close to you, and within your skill rating. Again this is just time consuming as you wait for it to eventually tell you that the connection quality is only medium and asking if you want to proceed anyway.
- Overall, this has led to  me spending more time waiting for games than actually playing them 
- Lastly, the ""Iconic Moments"" is just ridiculous, no idea what the % chances of getting some of the players are but I spent €30 on coins and spent it all on the recent AC Milan pack. Not one of the 3 classic players for this is crazy.

Could be great game even for a season update (FIFA style).

But too much scripting... makes Superstar, Legend and even Top Player difficulty unbearable to play even if you can win.

- When you take the lead opposite side goes berserk and even a series B team would perform like Top class, until they manage to equalize. Makes the game irritating, not let you enjoy your lead once and provides you no opportunities to take advantage of their aggressiveness. And I don't even want to talk about fouls given and foul executions.

- Pass detection is a mess... you have your DMF, you target up, and he pass to the advanced AMF instead of the player near you.. you target your 10 trying make an organised attack and he passes deep to the CF instead (no matter the power)... You are forced to use manual pass or to turn off the assist, and still is a mess by activating the most inappropriate player to receive the pass instead of the one you expecting to.

- Opponent defenders are always glued on your attackers but your defenders says f* this and let their lines undefended. Even if you set them to guard specific attacker...

- Most of the runs of your teammates (if they decided to make a run) are totally retarded... and yes I tried almost everything, and yes I know that you can call for a run (only one player). AI players don't even follow a retarded run and you can not break the lines and create opportunities. You are force to play 1-2 and then lose the ball most of the time.

For me this is a waste opportunity to remove the scripting on Pes2021 so it can feel fresh even for an season update, and then move to develop the next gen console PES.

I thumb it down, if you think that will work for you then what can I say good for you.

PS1: When you will break the second gamepad, you will understand that this game doesn't worth the money, because most of the time it plays itself...

I skipped a few editions and upgraded to PES 2021 from PES 2018. My initial impressions were good - the UI design was slicker and the graphics and player animations were much improved.

However, it did not take long to see that all of the old failings of Master League were still here. Scripted goals are still a thing, where AI players miraculously dance through your defence, with successful tackles doing little more than delaying the inevitable for a few seconds at best. Player statistics seem to be completely irrelevant - your quickest players will never outrun the AI's slowest and your powerhouse centre forward will stumble to the ground at the merest hint of contact from an AI defender. The AI's flawless timing on tackles means that it is almost impossible to dribble past a defender.

These things are annoying, but not fatal, and have been present in Master League for a long time. What has changed in the 2021 edition is a marked increase in another of Master League's age old flaws: increasing the difficulty of games by making your team play worse. Much worse. Cup games, derbies etc. can be almost unplayable with pass assist practically working against you and your world class players suddenly shambling halfwits unable to control the simplest of passes. This focus on making your team play worse rather than having the AI play better can make these games impossible to enjoy. And in 2021 this happens far, far more than in previous iterations and is much more noticeable.

Compared to the gameplay issues it's an extremely minor point, but manager avatars in 2021 Master League are truly bizarre. In previous versions there was rudimentary character customisation so you could make a manager that had a passing resemblance to you. That is gone in 2021 and now, instead, you choose from a list of about 12 predefined manager models based on real life managers. So unless you look like Roberto Carlos (yes, apparently) or Steven Gerrard you're out of luck.

It's hard to describe how disappointing PES 2021's Master League is. Where 2018 was an obviously flawed, but still mostly enjoyable affair 2021 is a frustrating slog with occasional moments of brilliance.",1617008521,1617008521,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Much nicer looker player models than FIFA
- Designed for customization (so importing the missing licenses/kits/faces is literally 5 mins of work)
- Quite affordable for hours of gameplay

BAD
- Sub-par commentary
- The user interface could be prettier and easier to use

UGLY
- Not for people looking for a quick and easy football experience
- Every year the same game

CONCLUSION
I recommend this game wholeheartedly. There is also a free lite version if you have any doubts.",1613624536,1616859456,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

NOTICE: I only played offline in Master League. First at ""Professional"" now at ""Top Player""

I had fun in the beginning when I was playing a lower tier club (Leeds United) and trying to get it on a higher level. Now around 50 hours I can't ignore my frustrations anymore when playing Chelsea with a squad of high rated players.

When you select a player sometimes for whatever reason they stop running for a second and face the opposite direction than the one they were previously facing. Resulting in too many scenarios where opponent just gets past your defender and your defender looks like some clueless person who never played fotball in their life.

Retarded judge AI doesn't have common sense in estimating obvious scenarios. Many times when there's offside I need to wait for the player to touch the ball in order for the referee to stop the play. This wastes everyone stamina and time. Players do this too when they mindlessly run at a ball they can never ever catch, but this one you can stop with RB + RT.

There are fouls which aren't fouls at all. A player goes to shoot a ball, opponent puts leg forward into shooters legs, gets hit and it's a foul.

Players looking at a ball going past them like they see it for the first time in their life.

In my opinion they are attempting to make a realistic football game but it's just not there yet. You have to constantly compensate and find compromises. Both between opponent difficulty (because increasing difficulty somehow increases abilities of low level players on abnormal levels) and level of control (assisted vs non assisted).

I'll still play this game from time to time and I do recommend it for those who want to have fun with their friends but I don't recommend it if you think these small details will annoy you.",1616017496,1616258051,False,4,1,0.520712971687316895,0,True,False,False

Be a pro mode I played for 1 night. The camera could be better and you cant do much with your player but either wait to come on as a sub (which is painfully boring) When you do play and do well theres no real sense of acheivment.

In higher difficulties your players are going to suck. Doesn't matter if your wing has 90+ speed, the defender with 65 is going to outrun your player...
Your passes going wrong 50% of the times. Shots in the face of the keeper most of the times. Your players hiding behind the defenders so you can't reach them with passes...
Also, broken referee... and every free kick near the box is goal if you do not jump well with the barrier.

So, while it works on a true next-gen version of PES for next year that’s exactly what we get here.

You’ve got updated squads, new kits for the small selection of licensed clubs, a smattering a new boots and some updated player and manager faces. There’s also the very limited Euro 2020 mode that launched as free DLC for PES 2020 and some minor gameplay tweaks that actually make this a better game of football than its predecessor. For the £25 asking price, and especially if you didn’t pick up PES 2020, this is a surprisingly good deal.

Even if, like me, you’re a die-hard FIFA fan, I doubt you could say with a straight face that EA’s offering gives a better semblance of the beautiful game than PES. It just simply doesn’t. PES is the king when it comes to gameplay, with a far more realistic and rewarding game that doesn’t feel like a number of canned animations sewn together. Your decisions make a difference in PES 2021 and there’s a feeling of satisfaction when you join multiple passes together and see the ball fly into the top corner that is absent elsewhere.

If you played PES 2020 then the gameplay is 99% the same here. The ball physics remain excellent and the slightly slower speed at which matches happen not only feels more realistic, but it lets you actually create nice build-up tactics rather than just bombing down the wing with Jadon Sancho. The general animations are excellent and every touch, knick from a defender or shot just about feels unique.

If you played hours upon hours of PES 2020 you’ll likely notice some of the small gameplay improvements. Movement feels a bit more fluid, passes and through balls seem to feel better and I still love being able to manually move players off the ball. All in all it’s mostly a pleasure to play whether you’re on the attack or hunkering down at the back.

Whereas in FIFA defending can be infuriating, here it’s far more a case of being patient and timing things correctly. The first few games I was conceding numerous goals, but after some practice and relearning the nuances of PES I was back to controlling the game.

A big downside with this Season Update mantra is that gameplay issues from PES 2020 haven’t been fixed. My biggest issue is the AI of the players, which all too often leaves them wandering randomly around or not moving towards the ball until it lands at their colourful Nike boot. I found myself having to wait for the ball to arrive before I could do anything meaningful. These bouts feel much more obvious when the majority of the gameplay feels very real.

I will say this, Fifa is easier to play, (no matter what difficulty you play) I am not saying, Fifa is a walk in the park, but PES 2021, is a lot harder to master. I recommend this game with my eyes close. If you're looking for a GREAT soccer game, then look no further. If you have Fifa, there is no reason to play this, but if you love soccer that much, both games in your library, is the way to go. I got the Juventus edition, and in my opinion, is the best PES 2021 edition.

Won 5 concecutive matches against a lag cheater one day and all of them got canceled on 90th min.

When can I expect my refund?

You have sold me a product that does not work as intended and you have failed to fix this within a reasonable timeframe. 

A problem that is affecting your very core-product should have been mended within hours of its discovery, not days. And certainly NOT WEEKS!

I demand my money back since you are dealing with something that seems more like a scam-operation than a game developing company

Your previous customer and client

Update 2020-12-18
I've been in contact with them several times now. The only response I've gotten after providing them with all the specs they've asked for is how grateful they are for my patience and understanding. DUDE! There is NO PATIENCE or UNDERSTANDING! FIX THE GAME or GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!

Update 2021-02-21
It has been three months now since my last post. Konami has asked for, and received a full schematic of my system and game installation, nothing happens. When I contact them I get generic answers and courtesy phrases.

I was hoping for a breakthrough with data pack 4. Alas, nothing. I then contacted steam for a refund, but since I have tried to mend the problem and, because of this, the time restriction for a refund has expired.

So now I have a game I can't play that the developer refuses to fix and the retailer refuses to refund.

Thank's Konami, you füx#1ng pieces of $#1t company.

Konami jokes with the consumers by pushing the same game every year. This is basically the same game as 8 years ago, pes 13 was the only time they actually slightly improved the game from previous versions. This edition doesn't worth a single penny as it is a DLC for pes 20 with literally nothing new.
After playing every single PES since winning eleven 1, this is the last time I wasted my time with this and I regret my decision to not invest time in FIFA before. 
I have many more arguments to support:
1) They use the same menus that feel like you're in the 80's. 10 clicks to do even the most basic things. They simply disregard any investment in usability and UI. Bad translations. No proper instructions around how to play the game, just couple mambo jumbo sentences that doesn't really help anyone learn how to play the game, how to aim a header, how to avoid many of the odd situations that seems like comedy in gameplay. 
2) The player rating system is the same as 20 years ago, the attributes doesn't change the gameplay at all. Licences are terrible, you can't find not even 20% of the teams that actually matter. Every roster is NEVER, i repeat, NEVER in sync up with reality. Clearly there is zero research on what's current going on, feels like they watch the news once every few months to see who is the player with more marketing and then boosts that one. All teams except the ones that are sponsoring the game are shitty, specially from less-known centers.
3) It is completely ridiculous how they favour Bayern, Barcelona and the few teams that gives money to Konami to promote themselves. Only these teams get good stats in their players. It also influences match results.
4) Online experience is the worst ever. Matchmaking doesn't work, location limiting all the place, you can never exactly know how big the ping is as it constantly suggest people from the other side of the world to play with you. Also, there is no ranking system. Throws you into almost all matches with >200 ping regardless of where you're playing from (i tried it from 3 different countries with same bad experience). They pretend to have some ranking system in place but there isn't, it's all just just some japanese-like nonsense numbers that grow when you win and shrink when you lose, but that is not related to anything else. When you just start your team with crap players they put you against people with All star teams with all 100 rating players and you get constantly crushed.
5) Infinite number of bugs and comedy situations in the gameplay. It has nothing to do with how real football works. Very strong and irrational catch-up logic where, if you're winning a game, it forces you to make dumb mistakes in defence in order to give your opponent the chance to turn around and beat you. There is no logic on how the referee works, fouls and everything feels like a different sport entirely.

I could keep writing how bad this game is, but in summary Konami will never get my time or money again. I will start playing FIFA now.",1611601504,1613590672,False,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

1st. Its full with bugs. I was playing a match and the game just froze and put me in the menu because of an Uptade. But its not the end of the story because i tried to restart the game after the Uptade has finished but the game didnt lunch in fullscreen. And you cant put the game in Fullscreen when it started once. The only option remained to delete the game and reinstall it. And i deleted it and reinstalled it. But THEN THE GAME DIDNT LAUNCHED THE BUYED VERSION IT LAUNCHED THE LITE VERSION!!!! THANL YOU KONAMI THANK YOU!!
2. In my opinion there are not enough teams/leagues in the game
3. There is a same thing just like in Fifa its called ""script"" and thats when the ball gets to your enemy every time EVERY TIME!
4. this game makes only problems in your life : Reinstalling because the game cant launch in Fullscreen and then Reinstalling because IT LAUNCHES THE LITE VERSION WHAT THE HECK KONAMI!?!??!!?

For example, if they are open, they'll run toward the defender, run backwards, or start their run forward and then stop when you pass to them. On the other hand, none of these handicaps affect the COM, who have players making perfect runs and react instantaneously when defending.

To make matters worse, if the COM decides to start the game on red - attack minded, that adds an extra layer of handicap in that they are able to press you as a team, attack with everyone moving forward, and defend with everyone running backwards with no detriment to their stamina for the entire game. This results in your players being unable to string along competent passes: passes get intercepted because your players delete their own space, through balls no matter the strength will overshoot, passes may hit the heels of your players, etc.. while this rarely if ever, impacts the COM. 

In summary, you can begin to recognize moments when you are in for some absurd ""dynamic difficulty"" momentum bull shit that ruin the game. You don't lose fairly, you lose unfairly that makes you feel like you have been cheated and had no control in your game.",1613348918,1613348918,False,4,0,0.527703940868377686,0,True,False,False

pros- better music than last years pes
          great master league
          hardest difficulty a good challenge at times

Cons- players are dumb as hell especially with their ball control
        -  doesnt matter if you best dribbler or have one of the fastests  players any player that is slower somehow keeps up with you. this also applies to  strength.
-A.I thinks theyre barcelona for every team i play against just passes the ball and doesnt do anything for half the time they have the ball except waste my time
-passing is just horrible 
- i bought vvd and he somehow gets overpowered by a player with low strength stats or gets out ran but a slow ass forward which means when you raise difficulty stats dont mean shit every player is the same practically


summary- i like this game its better than fifa at the moment but hopefully they fix their gameplay mechanics cause its frustrating but despite everything i said its ok just warning new buyers its going to be annoying playing the weaker sides cause all they do is go all out defense aka park the bus. so better be creative with players with good passing stats oh wait that doesnt matter lol",1612261565,1612261565,True,0,0,0.486486494541168213,0,True,False,False

Not tried online so can't comment, i mostly played Master League with a few games against the AI on My Club mode.

That game had a lot of issues. I tend to focus more on the Master League because I like the management aspect of it. Sadly, all the problems that game had are back here and some are even worse. 9 out of 10 times when the ref calls a foul it's for the opposing team. Speaking more broadly, there are a lot of oddities when playing. The goalie will just stand there sometimes and not do anything when you shoot. Opposing players can just straight up tackle you and it's not a foul. Overall, gameplay is alright. Definitely not great. The UI also got revamped from what I've seen but I think it's worse now. A lot of things are buried deep  where they shouldn't necessarily be. I may be wrong, but there was no way for me to see what my team's star ranking was in Master League. One of the best things about Master League is seeing how your team progresses and changes over time and the star ranking is an ok reflection of that. Except I couldn't fucking find it. I won't complain about the licenses, fake names and lack of stadiums even though I should. Those can be fixed if you download a file. I also won't complain about the online because I haven't played.

My main point of focus with football games has always been single player Career Mode, so everything I reference here relates to that specifically.

The main issues I have experienced (All ASSISTS Turned off + Max Difficulty:Legendary) is that the animations are janky.  

They are simply not smooth enough, 360 degrees of angle are not available and switching direction is a very digital sharp experience; the ball physics are not realistic enough either (stops too soon - like playing in mud);  The replays & cutscenes are equally frustrating when they stop and hang for 2-3 seconds before the game starts again.

Some of the AI player movement however is very good (In terms of football flow), attacking and passing from the AI can be very authentic at times allowing for quick decisive football to be played ; making for some for good exciting footballing moments.

When passing yourself though (without assists turned on) can take too long to initiate a simple short side-pass (causing you to get tackled when you shouldn't) & due to the limited degrees of animation available the passing angles are also limited and the weight of a pass is inconsistent.

An example : there is a throughball button...why?  If I can accurately control the power and direction I put into a pass I can make my own throughball...so it stands to reason that the game is in part calculating who you want to pass to & frequently getting it wrong.

Now the AI are certainly NOT perfect either; there are many situations where an AI player will just turn in circles rather than cross, pass or try and take the ball past a defender.

The commentary is another area that needs work; the comments often do NOT accurately reflect what is happening on the screen and the number of comments available are so limited you get repetition many, many times even in a single match.

I do like and appreciate how I WILL Be substituted off if I am playing badly or lacking fitness, something I rarely if ever see in FIFA.

As a final thought:  I have played FIFA and PES for many years and the most recent feature that made me choose FIFA over PES was tackling.  The addition of a button to actually stick your foot out and tackle a player (or intercept a pass) made FIFA feel more realistic (not the case anymore due to many issues) but the one thing I can barely stand is pressing and holding a single button to tackle, it is horrible and completely unrealistic and has not been improved for more than 30 years!  Time to think about doing this the right way PES!

PLEASE STOP trying to copy FIFA!  If PES can bring us a realistic feeling footy game you will put a nice dent in FIFA, if you just copy FIFA's FUT you're just going to be a poor imitation.

CONS
Gameplay:
- the obnoxious scripting where suddenly AI turns into Super Saiyan's is a game-breaker.
- motion is so sluggish that it feels like the players are running in mud
- dribbling is near impossible unless you're a ""pro"" at this game, problem is defenders auto-tackle so accurately and at times from way out of a realistic range.
- tackling/fouls is yet another game-breaker, so many slight knocks that lead to yellow and red cards is unbelievable in this game.

Graphics:
- ""PES has better graphics"" - no it really doesn't, the kits look like clay melted onto the players' bodies. Or you could say that players look like they're wearing 20 layers of clothing. Look at FIFA21 and how the kits literally move/stretch when they're in motion.
- ""grass is better in PES"" no not really, the green is so over-saturated it begins to look like an animation rather than real life, hence the million grass mods available.
- Konami has made maybe 1000 ""REAL"" faces in this game, and have given 25,000+ players clone faces that look so awful you have to remind yourself you're not stuck in 2010. Seriously, how does Marco Reus not have a real face????????
- Just about every face ""mod"" is stolen from past FIFA games, which just goes to who there who is better in that category.
- As usual, Konami is too lackluster to purchase the licence for more teams, so once again players are forced to mod kits into their games, some people even having to pay (PESUNIVERSE).
- Master League is so lackluster, just, Konami have a gander at FIFA21/20/19/18/17/16/15/14/13 and maybe actually try to do better? better at least compared to FIFA13 career mode ?????

UI/Sound/misc:
- Sound is actually not too bad, but then again how hard is it to implement recordings.
- the UI is actually rubbish, Konami aren't hiding the fact that they are dwarfed by EA's budget.
- the amount of god-damn pop-ups when you enter the game, NO I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR PROMOTIONAL/ONLINE CRAP :S

This game is a joke. The AI is horrible, the refereeing is stupid. Players play passes to whoever they want, nowhere near the direction you're telling them to, clear on-ball tackles are fouls, stray balls bounce around the field with half the players on the team either just looking at it or running pass it.

Tried playing BAL and started in the 2nd English Division. My team's ONLY tactic (100% of the time, yes, unless they somehow screwed up a pass or something) in the back is pass the ball to one of the side defenders and he would long pass it to the striker. No variation whatsoever. Every time the ball would end up at a side defender, a long ball to the striker was played. Every time the ball would end up at a central defender, he'd pass it to a side defender and guess what? Yeah... Only one time out of like 100 did the ball somehow end up behind the other team's defenders and to our striker and he scored. ONE TIME. Rest of them are just spray-and-pray style, just kick the ball maybe something happens.

While the graphics, animations and other visual stuff seem awesome, the actual gameplay is disastrous and so far from what PES used to be. Never have I been so frustrated or let out so many WTF's and ""How the f**k""'s in a football game.",1609164570,1609164570,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am looking forward to the PES 2022 and the Unreal Engine 5 engine. If they make a light and fun-oriented game instead of a heavy game like 2020, that's when the competition with FIFA starts. People are looking for fun in games, of course, realism will be, but due to the extremely slow gameplay of 2020, it was becoming unbearable after a certain period of time. It is the same game but the price is really affordable, and it is great that they give 3000 coins worth 30 dollars and 1 free icon player.Yes it's worth the price:

Pros:
- cheaper than Fifa
- improvement on the UI (i like the simple menu)
- so far so good (no lag, no annoying bug)

I assume they have an invisible high mental defence stat and often will only follow basic one button commands at certain moments in the game, i.e. penalties, free kicks and when you get desperate you make them hunt the ball down like a homing missile. Each mouth breathing husk has the illusion of free will in the form of statistics and a game to game buff, utter indifference or debuff called conditioning, which vaguely give the impression of individuality. This is assisted also by the strategy menu in which you can place minions in a way you deem aesthetically pleasing. The playable characters seem to behave autonomously while you are mentally manipulating one of your victims, but only the creature you control is capable of making a real difference; kicking, pretending not to kick (in a variety of ways) and scoring goals. You must score at least one more than the opposition to achieve a win scenario.

During a match there is one uncontrollable character known as a referee whose appearance shape shifts but their statistics seem to stay the same. They have a whistle and can point. If a player tries to take the ball inappropriately, of which the definition isn't clear or explained in game, they will often unveil a card of either yellow or red but usually sequentially from yellow to red. Interestingly they will rarely show these cards to the AI parasite. I found them to be far too influential on a match and gave the AI a lot of opportunities to score. The referee also has two companions who communicate in semaphore, and they're infallible in their decision-making.

There are several scenarios to overcome and a vast amount of nebulous clubs to choose from each of varying colours and stats. I can't speak for the majority of them as I have exclusively only played as Japan in the Asia-Oceania Cup on the superstar difficulty level. At the time of writing this review (41.5 hours...) I finally won it, which fair enough, might say more about me than the game. My vacuous marionettes unstrung themselves and celebrated as if they had achieved this trophy on their own merit. Unaware of the brain pilfering abomination in their midst and its vain and insatiable lust for silverware.

This takes most of the fun away. The game doesn't run silky smooth even after every graphics card update and lags on systems above the recommended specs. Considering the reasonable amount Konami charged for it it is not a bad purchase but not a great deal either. It basically comes down to a habit with the PES series : If you're a football fan and your team is featured in the current iteration, you want to see how well they fare in a simulated environment. This is as much of a reason to buy a football simulation as is enjoying the game itself.

The AI are never off balance the way you will be off balance when tackled so they easily take the ball right back or the ball conveniently falls into the legs of the nearest AI player. Even if you send in more players to mark.

Harmless standing tackles are too often reffed as fouls and your players fail to challenge for obvious interceptions or passes to them. Sliding tackles are guaranteed yellow cards. The AI standing tackles are 100% precise every single time no matter what team it is or player involved. AI often hilariously takes the ball under your players foot as the shoot animation takes place and if your foot touches theirs during the shooting animation it is an immediate foul in favour of the AI. 22 hours into the game and a referee has never called a foul in favour of my players so I often end up with upwards of 7 fouls per game to the AIs 0. 

Any set piece the AI gets will result in a shot on goal - doesn't matter from how far back. If its anywhere near the box its a goal as long as the AI is shooting it. The passing is over hyped by Konami. Pass weight is disgustingly inconsistent and pass direction is forever on its own mission. The through ball is broken in this game and your players tend to dawdle instead of running forward to receive the ball - often only choosing to run when it will be an obvious offside or when the rest of the AI team has caught up. Creative passes to an open player that could lead to a goal are punished and not rewarded, as the receiving player is nudged off course without a pushing animation by the AI or slowed down to a crawl without a justifiable animation/ reason when AI players are nearby. 

For all the hype that has been made about how ''fantastic'' and ''realistic'' the passing is, I find it laughable how making a pass ''off balance'' leads to the lousiest pass you'll ever see and yet the AI itself routinely gets away with extremely accurate passes under high pressure situations with ease. Having a fast player like a Sane, Dembele or Mbape means nothing in this game because even with a 10 meter head start the AI will catch that player and guide him off the ball with ease. Easy headers or passes are foiled when the ball goes right through your receiving player and into the possession of the player BEHIND you.

The big 5 star teams are easiest to beat and the ones where the player with the highest overall is 70 are the hardest to beat because of broken scripting. None of the goals the AI score ever feel deserved because of the scripting that allows them to get the ball in the first place. The commentary is extremely dated, some player names aren't even included so the commentary goes silent and the interface looks similar and equal to or worse than PES 2011 (The previous PES game I had). Frustrating experience doesn't cover it. Just buy FIFA.",1606784631,1608387083,False,59,7,0.6575736403465271,0,True,False,False

- The bots are lame, your teammate bots are terrible. 
- You pass the ball out, if the ball is intercepted at that pass, the player that you controlled has no respond to it, even the interception happened right in front of it.
- You cannot shoot at certain angle. I'm using keyboard, not sure is it only happen to keyboard?
- If you low cross the ball to the opponent six yard box, your forward will NOT use his leading foot to tip the ball. It will use it's another foot instead, which makes the scene funny.

For some reason I assumed we had moved forwards since that game came out, but to be honest that game is **a lot** more fun to play than this. This game is full of inexplicable bugs.
- Players missing obvious interception opportunities even when the ball rolls quietly past 1m ahead of them
- My players rushing and crashing into my own goalie or even saving the ball 0.5m before my goalie would've had it (and no way to stop them from doing this)
- Players constantly running into eachother and falling
- Referee gives out fouls and yellows constantly for no reason, ignores others
- Referee takes really long to stop the game in case of offside, causing you to sprint 100m towards the goal first
- The AI takes a really long time to take corners, they just stand there for a while delaying the game
- There are replays of every little semi-interesting situation, and you have to press start (not A) on the controller to skip them (although you skip everything else with A) which makes for a really frustrating experience
- The ingame menus are difficult to navigate (go to Settings to shut down the game???)

It's better than the 2020 edition, despite only being a season update. It feels better to play both online and offline. The UI is better. Overall an improvement on 2020, which wasn't that great. It's quite fun and there are plenty of tactical options, but they keep them simple so anyone can play around with them.

Most people pick big teams online, but I like to pick 'lesser teams' as it makes things more interesting for me. 

One last thing, for the official names, extra faces, full kits etc etc please check out SmokePatch (google it). Those guys have been doing this for years are for me are the best. Comes with easy installer and easy way to 'switch off' the patch so you can play online.

I am saying this because I own both game PES and FIFA and in PES no matter what difficulty level you play you have always support from your AI controlled teammates while FIFA is just for people who wants play online FUT and waste hell lot of money. I say worth investing money in PES than FIFA. Lastly if PES is looks my review please consider and review your player face graphic they really looks unreal specifically jaw and mouth portion.

Same (badly) scripted football-like game as ever where you control one player (two if you know how to partially control a second one) vs 11 enemy players + ref. Outraging random refereeing where two-feet hack from behind can be just a lecture, but any contact harder than a kiss on a cheek is ALWAYS a foul (vs COM) and a most likely a yellow. Don't get me wrong, I play since PES5 and know how to win, but literally nothing changed since first post-PES6 release (what it was? PES 2007? 2008? who cares).
You can get it more or less enjoyable with advanced/manual finishing and passing. but it's not easy to master and I bet 99% of new players will ragequit rather sooner than later.
Still, I don't ""recommend"" the game 'cause it's pointless to recommend the only game on the market. No, football games where you CAN'T SAVE A GODDAMN REPLAY doesn't count. At all. You can buy it, especially considering a ""special"" price, but don't expect a ""football simulator"". It's more like ""football storyteller"" where most of the stuff on the pitch is decided for you (unless you go full manual controls). Considering that, ""Become A Legend"", where you control only one player, is a most balanced mode.
Another annoying thing about PES is how fast they update rosters. As of November, 6, line-up of Juventus, one of the title teams, is still fundamentally wrong. Didn't checked other teams, but I bet it's the same. You should learn from Sports Interactive, Konami guys.

UPDATE: DataPack 3.0 is out, Juventus lineup is still heavily wrong. This is anything but ""SEASON UPDATE"".",1604664531,1607030932,False,2,0,0.503866016864776611,0,True,False,False

But in order to  be honest the game is a piece of crap. If you allow me a few minutes of your precious time, I will try to explain myself as accurate as possible. First, once the game decides that you are going to loose , there is nothing at all that you can do. YOU ARE GOING TO LOOSE. Your opponent will score and you will not. It does not matter your strategy, your players or whatever. You will loose, and that it is a fact. Second, if you are playing a mayor league the top teams will win almost all the games reaching an imposible score like 37 wins 1 draw which it is totally unreal. Third, your players won´t follow your commands. You may try to defend or to steal a ball or even anticipate a pass. Your players will be lazy, won´t follow your commands, and guess what, YOU WILL LOOSE. I´m almost a 50 years old guy and I have been playing video games since I can recall and this it is not ok. I don´t care if I loose, I´m use to it. As a matter of fact, I loose a lot, and I´m ok with it. But I want to loose when I deserve it, not when the game decides it. I belive a game should be a challenge but not a cheater and this game definitely it is. Please forgive me about my english as it is not my first language. I hope I´ve been able to express myself properly, and I wish you all great and enjoyable times with some other awesome games. Best of luck.",1606686015,1606686015,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Not only the stuttering with or without vsync, and dizzy screen effect, but the fps is only up to 47. The game is poorly optimised, while my rig is better than suggested requirements - it was the first game I lowered settings for. It's very strange, since FIFA 2018 with in comparison next gen graphics, physics and animations - works smoothly and doesn't make your gpu 90C (junction) in 3 minutes. Strange UI, not sure if there even is exit from main menu without ALT+F4. Console interface experience in it's worst representation. Game looks like it did in 2016, with added grass and sharpness filter, so it at least has to work like it did, not that worse on a high end build. Also each Thursday the game won't work from 00:00 to 6:00. And people say Fifa 2021 is bad bcz it's same. Better be the same, than broken while techincally still stuck in times of ps3... There is hope things will change with the 2022 version on new engine, but now this either should be heavilly fixed or not worth purchase at all.

Had plans to play it with friends, since was a fan of old parts and had a break playing FIFA instead, but forced to make a refund that breaks all plans, since this is the same game with an optimisation gamble and no improvements over years. I could tolerate same game, but only if it at least worked as a game on pc should.

-Full of script u cant get away from script but (efoot 20/21 script is so impactful)
-Horrible...horrible online experience more like a russian roulette either u or the opponent or both ll lag ( in most cases ) , devs doesnt do anything to improve it , no region lock , no ping cap .
-Horrible old outdated , great modes still hidden from players ( i mean new players ll be confused )
Pros : 
-No pay to win everyone can get top of the line players without spending money , ahem not like fifa.
-Realistic gameplay , variety and i mean VARIETY of players animation espacially goal keepers , u just feel they r acting exactly like real life.
-Offline experience is way better than online and show how this game is killed with that horrible non improved Online.

Can be a struggle at first, but once you get the hang of things it's great! The support from the devs is that much better then that of Fifa... which I have played a while untill I got tired of all it's bugs in the singleplayer experience, missing features, broken dynamics. In PES you can be subbed on/off dependent on your performances on the pitch. On fifa you either start and go all the way out the game, regardless of your performance (or if you run out of all your stamina is the only way the manager on fifa will sub you off). Being subbed on isn't even a feature for Fifa become a pro player. Which is dissapointing as it is a football game. 

Though the game felt odd and slow paced at first, you'll more then likely come to enjoy it if you enjoy more realistic gameplay, and feel like actually becoming a pro while playing. Where as Fifa you just feel like doing things for no reason. Transfer market seems to work 2/10 times you request it. While here it works simutaniously, just ask that you wish to leave when the window is open, and you'll get transfers in that suits for your development. There is also an option to ask your agent to request a transfer to a specific club, which will make him talk to the respecitve manager at the club about a possibility of a transfer for you to the suggested club. 

Once more, you have an actual contract in PES, whilst Fifa, you don't at all. Get to a club, you're there infinitely till you get a transfer and decide to leave. Also salary don't increase at the same club you're at, it only changes after you switch clubs. But in PES, you've got a contract, and if you do well the same club can and will offer you a better contract with them. Contracts has certain amount of years/time, like in real life. 

[b][u]So to sum it up...[/u][/b]

If you are looking for a realistic football game to create your pro and feel like actually accomplishing things, struggeling to be fit and in form to keep your spot in the line-up. Then for sure this is the game for you. You may be put off that this don't have as many licenses as Fifa does, and hence you don't get that real realistic feeling and enjoyment... [spoiler]Well there are mods to implement the teams of your desire, and it isn't hard to do at all. [/spoiler]

[spoiler]For reference I'd give Fifa a 2/10. It amazes me how many times they can copy paste a game and expect fans to be happy with that.

Switching from FIFA, I've played PES 2020 and now the 2021 version. And yeah, like we all know it, it's pretty much the same game. Although I would say, players seem a tiny touch quicker in their reaction times and movements. And there's less of those moments where the player doesn't know what to do because they lost the ball. 

As I said in my review of the previous entry in the series, this is the game that made me fall in love with football again. It feels good in the build-up play, in defense as well, and super satisfying when you bang a screamer from outside the box. Playing PES gives me something very simple yet very important that FIFA failed to provide me these past few years: FUN. And for a casual player like me, this is key.

Both PES and FIFA are flawed game, you just gotta pick your poison. And for me PES for it's gameplay, is the winner. Yeah the lack of licensing is a drawback, but if you're on PC, it's not a difficult issue to solve. And I personally think about it as downloading the licensing to ""enhance"" the game even more rather than ""fixing"" it.

Anyway, to conclude this mess of a review, I highly recommand it if you are looking for some real football fun, and I can't wait to see what Konami has in store for us next year with the new Engine",1605507502,1605507502,True,0,0,0.499271869659423828,0,True,False,False

However, there are a couple of differences, and to be honest, they're not nice changes at all.

Unfortunately, the game has been dumbed down big time.
-Goalkeepers are almost useless, any player can score outside from the box like they're freakin' Batistuta, right in the corner. And top players like van Basten or Rummenigge can even score while they're under huge pressure.
-Also the passing system is a mess. Even while you are facing away from your teammate, you are able to pass the ball with almost 100% accuracy.
The online script can still break these obviously but you know the script interferes and affects many dynamics in the game and it's just another evil.

Anyway, gameplay-wise, these are the two biggest differences I've experienced so far compared to PES 2020.
For the rest, you can read my review about PES 2020 [url=steamcommunity.com/id/k1nJo/recommended/996470] here[/url] as they still apply to this day(except the super-cancel bug).

But since the game is cheaper, I'll give a thumb up only to support Konami for the sake of PES 2022, so I hope our support this year isn't for nothing and PES 2022 can rival FIFA in all aspects and not just gameplay.

Edit: Actually, I changed my mind. And I'm changing my review to negative cuz it is fkn aids.
-Defending in a football game by pressing 2 buttons shouldn't be praised. It is so bad that if you wanna defend manually it punishes you. It feels like there is no skill gap between players, maybe except top 1%, but for the rest, for 3 consecutive years now it's like I'm playing against the same guy. It is disgusting.
-Also, a football game with a dead dribbling system shouldn't be praised.
-And a game mode (matchday) which forces you to play against someone who's literally 11000 kilometers away shouldn't be praised as well.

This is a garbage game, stay away from it, at least from the online modes if you little care about your mental health.

I'm loving the game; I don't tend to play ranked online much, I mostly run Master League and My Club (vs AI). Its a refreshing change of pace and realism compared to the other well known football game that just seems too Hollywood.

This football engine is a thing of beauty - some of the passages of play, still, after 70 hrs in is a joy to watch. I have a got a good raft of goals saved now and might do a montage :P

Licencing for clubs and uniforms is always a thorn in the side of Konami, but don't let that put you off, within 10 mins you can have all kits and logos.

One thing that does lack in this game is the commentary, it doesn't take long before you've heard every line and drone - this will hopefully be an area that will be addressed for the 2022 instalment. Also, I have to say, that online this game is completely different - it feels laggy and tends to be more ""fake"" i.e. you can feel when no matter how hard you try, you just can't help but concede.

Maybe next year I will snag the game up on console - as the community does seem rather low - matchmaking can take a while and none of my PC friends play PES :(",1601104437,1605453691,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Player responsiveness and awareness is non-existent. Defenders missing easy interceptions and ballwatching loose balls. Player switching always switching to the least needed player. Half the match you are not in control of your own players. 
Definitely not worth all the frustration that comes with that. 
Scripting feels heavier this time around. Especially on Matchday.
When none of that scripting happens, the game feels really nice and the game is a proper football game.
But, sadly, that doesn't happen very often. You can even tell when your opponent is on the losing side of scripting.
So, even when you win it feels like it's not because of your own skills.

Es gab mal eine Zeit in der die PES-Serie als eine gute und vor allem realistische Fußballsimulation galt. Bedauerlicherweise scheint diese Zeit vorbei zu sein. Aber fangen wir von vorn an...

Von den technischen Aspekten her ist das Spiel durchaus in Ordnung.
Recht moderate Systemanforderungen erlauben auch Besitzern älterer Systeme ein Spielen auf hohen Grafikeinstellungen. Überhaupt scheint es die Grafik des Spiels zu sein, die in den Releases der letzten Jahre konstant verbessert wurde (mein letztes PES war 2016). Auch die Soundkulisse ist sehr ordentlich, obwohl die Songs für den Soundtrack selbst vermutlich nicht jedermanns Geschmack treffen.

Damit erschöpft sich aber schon der positive Teil. Negativ zu bemängeln sind (in der deutschen Version) die kaum veränderten Kommentare. Die deutschen Reporter Hagemann und Küpper klingen bis auf ein paar Ausnahmen identisch wie in PES 2016, scheinbar hat man die Ansagen kontinuierlich weitergeschleppt. Diese klingen nicht nur langweilig, sondern sind auch immer wieder unzutreffend und die ausführlichen Monologe über das Wetter hätte man sich wirklich sparen können.

Zuvor haben andere Reviews die träge Steuerung moniert, dem muss ich leider zustimmen. Die Bewegungen sind zwar flüssig animiert, aber zwischen dem Auslösen einer Aktion und der Reaktion des gesteuerten Spielers vergeht gefühlt eine Ewigkeit (zumindest ist es eine Ewigkeit wenn der Gegner zwischenzeitlich nochmals eine Haken schlagen kann o.ä.).

Sehr schlimm ist auch das Verhalten der Schiedsrichter zu deuten. Das war auch schon in früheren Version so und ich hatte erwartet das es Konami über mehrere Jahre hinbekommt, den Schiedsrichtern so etwa wie Fingerspitzengefühl einzuprogrammieren. Leider unterscheiden diese weiterhin strikt nach Schwarz oder Weiß, also Foul oder nicht.
Tacklings kann man damit fast völlig vergessen, nahezu jedes Tackling was den Gegner ein wenig aus dem Tritt bringt wird als Foul gesehen und wohl nahezu immer mit einer Verwarnung geahndet. Allerdings gelingt es der KI irgendwie immer solche Tacklings perfekt anzusetzen oder nur soviel zu schubsen/ziehen/zerren das es gerade so durchgeht -> somit fühlt sich er Referee parteiisch an und dem gesamten Spiel wird der körperliche Aspekt genommen. Man fühlt sich wie beim Schachspiel, alles passiert auf rein taktischer Ebene und das ist für ein Fußballspiel zu einseitig.

Im Modus BAL verkommt das Spiel zu einer Komödie. Es scheint ein ungeschriebenes Gesetz zu sein, das jeder zweite Ball beim Gegner landet. Stellungsspiel ist für die KI-Mitspieler ein Fremdwort, statt einen freien Mitspieler drei Meter neben sich anzuspielen wird der Ball aus der eigenen Hälfte sinnlos nach vorn gebolzt. Selbst für spielerisch limitierte Mannschaften ist das unsinnig. Jede Schülermannschaft hat mehr Spielverständnis...

Aus meiner Sicht ist PES 2021 keine Empfehlung wert. Es ist zwar nicht wirklich schlecht, aber gut ist es ebenfalls nicht und der oft beworbene Realismus bleibt leider wegen der Unzulänglichkeiten auf der Strecke. Einzig der aktuelle Preis von nur 24 € tröstet etwas über diese hinweg.

+++

A long time ago the PES series stood for a good and realistic soccer simulation. These times seem to be over...

At first hand the game is quiet okay. Very good visuals even on average systems pleasing the eye.  It is mostly the graphics that developed over the past years. Also sound effects are pretty nice although the soundtrack is not everybody's taste.

So much for the good parts. Bad is the mostly unchanged comments, seems like KONAMI only added y few lines (and most of them about the weather conditions).I'm speaking here of the german comment, can't tell about other languages. Some sentences were even left unchanged compared to PES 2016.

Movement is somewhat sluggish, reactions of both your players and your teammates are poor but at least are animated well.

One of the worst things is the referee. Simply because it is either a foul or not he doesn't show any kind of sure instinct. This mostly results in a card once you go for a tackle. Surely the computer is mostly doing it right.... This (among other things) makes the referee appear not neutral and draws the physical aspects out of the game.

Hilarious is the BAL game mode. Seems like every second ball must land right in front of the feet of an enemy player. Positioning as well as passing seem to be foreign words for your team mates. They do like it better to plow the ball away instead of passing it to a free player a few yards away. Even for limited teams this not a realistic behaviour. It hurts...

So the current game is not really recommended. It lacks what made the series great and successful - realism. Only the current price of 24 € can comfort a bit.",1603017022,1604953265,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is not fun to play. I've genuinely tried to enjoy it, yet its numerous glaring flaws make that hard. Some of its issues include:

- Players so stupid it seems a prerequisite to have the majority of your brain scooped out with a soup spoon before you're deemed eligible to ascend to the status of PES AI.

- Chief among these endless dumb-dumb moments is the perpetual AI ball-watching. They seem to forget that they are in fact not spectators and have a responsibility to react to the ball. 

-You could stick 11 Roombas on the pitch and they would make more intelligent off the ball runs.

- Terrible foul detection. The opposition team could come to where I live, kneecap the family, urinate on my plants and dance around my burning house and it wouldn't be deemed a foul. 

- Players have the turning circle of a moderately sized planet.  Seriously though, if i wanted to feel like I was controlling an M4 Sherman Medium Tank I would have played Battlefield 1942. The agility is non existent and they're about as fun to control as broken glass is to eat.

I know the measured and adult response to any sort of criticism of the game is often ""git gud scrub"". However, I don't see the point when the game itself can't even ""git gud"".

This is soccer for crying babies if you need to help/hinder players with your awful, dreadful scripting!

Buy it for offline modes and maye, just maybe, for Seasons. Maybe for coop.
My point is: My Club (which is my favorite mode) is scripted again. Google it if you don't know what I mean.

Come to think of it, it's scripted not only on the side of the game, but also on the players: the game actually rewards ridiculous repetitive plays such as running to one of the corners and passing inside the area. Not to mention the scripted long ball at kick-off and corner kicks.

Just pathetic. Long gone are the days of actual skill and merit. Long gone are days in which you are actually rewarded for dribbling and for trying to come up with beautiful plays.

Update: people are still using the disconnect cheating exploit! It was supposed to be my fith win in a row when a my opponent disconnects and invalidates the match.
Naturally, the next match I lose and lose my streak. Screw this game.

Vanish from my life and from my library!

you will sometimes wait for 20 minutes before getting into a match only to be destroyed by players that are one shot one goal the entire game.
if Fifa is scripted, sadly PES is now even worst, with your players ignoring your inputs or failing the simplest of passes.
the gameplay is horribly slow even on the menus, with loading after loading.
the commentator voice is on loop, seems like you're hearing the same game, every game.

I used to enjoy buying players that had skill but now i have to ensure they have the strength to resist tackles from other opponent who just easily throw your player off balance without even trying. My players are super error prone it just feels like a tedious task playing as i cannot be creative in scoring, i have to clinically plan out my attack as most often than not the CPU will catch you.

The more you play the game though, the more you start getting angry at the way it is designed.
It is very similar to FIFA concerning the difficulty of the game:
-AI is insanely good at predicting your passes and movements
-Sometimes your players simply stop their run forward, just as you are passing the ball to them and the AI gets the ball for free
-The stats are completely out of balance with Atal scoring a volley-first-time shot from 35m out into the Top corner
-Sometimes the game is super easy and you win 3-0 no problem and then the next game your players are very slow, play horrendous passes and the AI simply lobs in long balls, then lays it off (because they ALWAYS win headers, even when you use super cancelling) and their striker puts it in

To conclude, it feels much like a simulated game with you being in the string puppet trying to influence the game. It seems as if the outcome of the game is already decided before you even kick off and the best things is when the AI plays ridiculously good in the second half after a bad first half and simply nets in 3 goals after you were 1-0 and that's how you loose in this game.
You simply do not have fun playing offline against the AI, because you have some games with only a little scripting, which are actually fun and then there are 2 games in a row where you could also put the controller aside and just let the AI do it alone and you wait until the scripted matches are over.",1601691649,1603565703,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

First of all, the refree system is a joke. Crucial last man tackle is just a yellow card and sometimes obvious fouls are not awarded. The controls for this game is quite confusing as it requires you to constantly release all controls of your controller and do nothing until your player receives the ball if not some weird passes or actions will happen. As for online mode, the input lag is so bad that it's impossible to build up an attack. As soon as you want to pass, the lag will delay it for 1 or 2 seconds. Thus your passing is like last-minute passes everytime. The opponent (with better internet) will easily counter attack you and score non stop. I regretted playing the online mode and spending some money on it. You can never win against a player with better internet because of your location. Everything is just lag. Can't attack, can't defend. Even the passes from top midfielders isn't even good. The players wont receive the ball properly at all. For offline mode is ok, but for online mode, its better if you just don't play.",1603275119,1603275119,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. There is no offline play. Or at the very least you have to be online when you start the game.
2. It's really difficult to find people to play with online.
3. This game frequently crashes for no reason and is very buggy.

Overall PES is a very frustrating experience and I do not recommend this game to people who have not previously played PES or FIFA...but if you have and you really love football then yes buy this game.

Steam and konami have done everything they can to ruin this game and when trying to download the 5th steam update in 5 days on an extremely crappy wifi network it sucks and when your game randomly crashes as you go from the pre game to kick off screen it sucks but if you can deal with that PES is the most realistic depiction of football on a pc.",1602905647,1602905647,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Single player feels fine to play, because the AI is terrible at capitalizing on your ""mistakes"", and thus makes it less agonizing to deal with. I wrote ""mistakes"" like this, because defensive errors rarely feel like your own faults, and moreso a combination of input lag, an inability of getting to control the correct player, and just people you have covering passing lanes flatout refusing to intercept balls. This happens multiple times each game, and most of the goals you score and concede will happen because of a mix of these things.

MyClub is the PES equivalent of Fifa's Ultimate Team, and I prefer it to FUT in everything except gameplay. You actually have the ability of improving your players through training, and Konami is quite generous with the ingame currency, and rare cards aren't as hard to come by as on fifa. That said, that's where it ends for me. I was quite enjoying single player for a while until I realized the only reason I was enjoying it was because I was winning a lot, since the AI is piss easy to beat. They fall into patterns way too much to be considered a challenge, even on the highest difficulties. Also there is little to no single player content, and in most of the matches you will play online you'll face teams with 5 legends (think Beckham, Puyol, young Messi), because of a glitch that allowed people to buy special editions of this game multiple times and acquire these cards. Most of the time they will use a 4-3-3 or a 4-3-1-2 and crowd the middle, only playing 1-2 passes which are very low-risk-high-reward since defending is such a crapshoot.


All in all, the game isn't all terrible, only the gameplay sucks.

I played a lot of fifa 20 and used to be a big PES fan back in the day and decided to give this new one a try. It was a big unpleasant surprise for the couple of games I played. At first I thought that maybe I wasn't enjoying it because I'm used to fifa's gameplay, but even with that aside the game didn't make me feel good when scoring a goal. Instead of a ""YESS, ONE - NULL BABY"", it was more like ""wow, finally a ball who doesn't hit the post"". In about 2 games, I hit the post 8 times, four each match. The passing is very inconsistent, often times the ball just goes through your player and he loses possession when trying to run after it. Also, almost everytime you try to tackle will result in a foul. 

In summary, I like to play offline better, and this is my personal view. PES 2021 was a big let down with unresponsive and slow actions from the player that often times resulted in an action that I did not intended and almost every game feels like just running after the ball especially if the AI decides to keep the possession.",1602382113,1602382113,False,1,0,0.481675416231155396,0,True,False,False

All of my major complaints about 2020 are fixed. It's now the beautiful engine from the last game, but you're allowed to tackle. 

tbh this is how PES has always been. The honesty this round is refreshing. While I'm intrigued by the next engine, I now actually enjoy playing in the current engine. 

If you played 2020, you'll likely turn the commentary off. Some of the classics are back - sparkling save etc. Also the commentator in my last game accused me of being shaky at the back recently - I literally haven't conceded a goal since I intalled the game.

Full disclosure I've only played 3 games (normal, normal, professional). Professional feels fair now that you can tackle, and I suspect I'll up the difficulty again - as opposed to deleting 2020 because the ref AI wouldn't stop cheating me.

PvP so far, experience worse than last time round. 2020 you had this 10 game grace period where you could play against people of a similar level in tight, fun games, before kicking you out of that so you just get smashed by Real Madrid/Munich every game after that. 

In 2021 you don't have that 10 game buffer, so far I've played 8 games online and have been smashed by Madrid in 4, Munich 3. Fair play to whoever smashed me as Roma, at least that was original.",1602371196,1602381219,True,1,0,0.503816783428192139,0,True,False,False

Just a few days ago KONAMI released new patch and behold same old problems are purposely forced back within the game. Purposely wrong pass directions, terrible ball trapping, players refusing to go in required positions etc. It completely ruins the gameplay. If you hated scripting in PES 2020 and tought 2021 will be different don't hold your horses.

It would be awesome if everybody just stopped playing and buying PES for few months enforcing KONAMI to stop tearing game apart with updates and patches.

Game is not about skill anymore. If you are constantly better than your oposition (I play on SuperStar), game will put arbitrary limitations to your team to balance the game and make it more fair. Why they do it?

2 reasons:
1st - Instead of putting real identity for players and teams KONAMI have chosen lazy approach where every team plays the same and ""difficulty"" is switched universally by unseen algortims where they handicap you or your opponent.

2nd -  To help new players online don't get crushed by more skilled players and stay in the game and buy more s***

PES 2022 won't be any different regardless the new engine. Offline play is completely abandoned and they are trying to shift focus to get people to go online and play MyClub. This is KONAMI new forte. FIFA have been doing it for years. Now PES will do the same.

PES as you know it and remember it before, a beautiful game of football and skill is gone and is NEVER coming back. And neither am I.  Don't buy this game if you think you will enjoy playing and have fun. You wont. For 1 or 2 game everything will be ok and then everything will be frustration. Rinse and repeat.

Pros
- Master League : I am absolutely having a blast with ML, it's such a fresh change compared to Career mode from fifa. Every match feels realistic and something I have to fight for even if its against a relegation contender. Love the little cut scenes but they do get repetitive after the first season. I wish there were some more cutscenes, other than that ML has been what I've played majority of my 50 hours with so far.

- Gameplay : Ooh boy is the gameplay fluid and realistic at the same time. No two matches feel same, AI changes their tactics by recognizing patterns in the play, forcing me to change my play style. There are some annoying issues like the Referees being very inconsistent, Lack of injuries, and the Player switching Bug which causes players to loose momentum when i switch (not always). The ball physics are breath taking, watching my wing backs hurl in crosses is a joy to watch.

Cons : 

MyClub : So far I have had a hard time trying to find anyone to play against in MyClub, Finding online matches takes 10+ minutes at times and even when I do find a match, the connection is extremely poor. I havent been able to finish any of my 5 matches I have played so far in MyClubs. This could be a region specific issue, I am not sure.

Presentation : Coming from fifa, the presentation in PES leaves a lot to be desired, but looking at how solid the gameplay is, I am pretty sure this will be what they start focusing more on moving forward.

Overall, I feel its a Solid time to jump from the sinking ship that is FIFA, especially at the discounted price. I am really looking forward to a year filled with PES for me and already excited for the next year's PES with the Unreal engine!!",1602011789,1602011789,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

There's just so much wrong with the game. Stellar AI defense that will outrun, chase you down, errant passes, Never really sure how your through ball passes will go. Even the softest pass forward may send the ball rocketing by your intended target. And on the flip side your harder hit through balls seem to have 5 pounds of lead inside barley moving along. Bad, and lets be clear here. Bad, Bad, well just plain horrible officiating. Don't bother trying to slide tackle. You will get called for it and most likely carded as well. I mean yeah. The officiating really ruins the game on it's own. 

Too bad really. Unlike that Pace whoring other game known as FIFA this game really lets you break a team down and really lends well to building up chances to score on goal. I dunno. I guess a game that's been around for this long shouldn't have such horrible game play as this. But alas, It's all about the money anymore isn't it? And btw. My Club looks to cost a small fortune to get the players in you want. Dare i say even more than FIFA? Why can't we just bid on players? Props to EA. At least i get a steady amount of contracts to keep my players in the game instead of having to spend the coins that i make from games to keep my players in the game. That's enough from me. I could go on but i won't. Konami has really taken a once great franchise and just pimped it out. Buy at your own risk.",1601593449,1601593449,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

FIFA feels better in some ways, but PES does in others. PES 2020 was a slower, more methodical game than FIFA, in which it mattered more what the stance of the player is when giving a pass than in FIFA, for instance, and where shots more easily just fly off into space if you don't choose carefully when to press the shoot button. Getting the hang of these mechanics often meant that goals scored were more satisfying because they felt more earned, and that appealed to me. PES also looks great in its own right, and has heaps of bespoke animations that can make certain team plays feel more unique. But on the flip side, FIFA's close control just feels better. In FIFA, all players feel like Messi-like geniuses of ball control and passing, whereas in PES, they feel like average footballers at times, but you can still pull off amazing moves with regularity if you learn how to manage the game's rhythm. There is a place for both of these styles to co-exist, in my opinion, with neither being outright better than the other.

That brings me to PES 2021. One of the reasons on-field players felt like less capable footballers at times in PES 2020 was because the close control simply felt bad. Tackle collisions felt like the ones you would have in FIFA 6 years ago, and the skill moves system, which supposedly had been upgraded with the input of Andrès Iniesta, was straight-up terrible in my opinion. Say what you will about momentum, but even the best players in the world moved like heavily-loaded trucks at times in PES 2020. Konami updated the game many times and at some point seemingly made the game play worse than before, but the final update in the summer made the game reasonably good. This positive endpoint came at the end of a long year of weird changes, though.

So, the biggest thing about PES 2021 is that it makes that gameplay feel even tighter than PES 2020 did at its most fluid best. The tweaks that have been made were small, but the sum of them is impactful for ""feel"" of the game: the  the skill move controls feel better, players are more responsive, and the whole game speed also seems slightly faster. What you end up with is a game that still has all of the things that made PES 2020 a very good football game on the pitch, and also has elements that make it feel closer to FIFA at times. PES 2021 feels more fluid than PES 2020 did. That said, FIFA is still a fair bit faster and more fluid still, so PES 2021 feels like the more deliberate game despite all of the above. They are still very different. 

There are still times when the game feels somewhat stilted though; it is no FIFA. Off the pitch, the game is also genuinely unchanged, with menus that look more aged than time itself. The manager mode is good, but nothing to get truly excited about. I don't play these games online at all, I simply stick to quick matches and the manager mode, so I can't comment on other aspects. 

The changes are welcome, though the game could still stand to have a slightly better flow at times. And it is by no means FIFA, even though it feels faster than last year. But to sum it up: the on-field action is great. If the game had been completely unchanged from last year, like the marketing blurb on the Steam page says it would be, saying whether or not it was worth the 25 - 30 euros would be more difficult. But the improved gameplay for me easily makes it worth upgrading to me. If upgraded squads and slightly but noticeably improved gameplay sound like they might be worth the budget price to you, I can recommend you to get it.",1601568625,1601568625,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

2. Lack of polish : The outdated interface, menus, player movement and animation not quite on the level of FIFA, and MyClub is Poorman's  FIFA Ultimate Team

The AI seems to get dumber with every iteration. Thankfully this is the last one on the Fox Engine, which has been a dreadful engine for PES. 

Pros: Great player likenesses. Great lighting and shadow effects. Dribbling is very good (although ruined by dumb AI moving out your way). Full Manual controls in enjoyable. 

Cons. Very stupid AI who constantly move out of your way instead of trying to tackle you. CPU controlled teammates unaware the ball is right in front of them, so they don't take possession of it and the game doesn't change you into that player, forcing your to give up possession. Player switching is terribly inconsistent. Presentation and commentary is stuck in 2010. Midfield is not required, the game is simply about who can score the most, ignoring the fact in real football you can defend well and steal the win with a single goal. Referees are completely useless, blatant fouls are let go, whilst clean tackles are punished. 

Ultimately, i play this game simply for my love of football, but i don't recommend it. And wouldn't even call it enjoyable. The AI is far too dumb, the game leans far too much towards attacking, rendering the midfield pointless and the defence an afterthought. The frustrations far outweigh the enjoyable parts. 

PES used to be a tactical battle, in terms of formations, tactics and lineups along with midfield battles and decision making like when to press, when to sit, when to push forward. Now its just a sprint and shoot game, like FIFA.

Pros:
	Pacing: I can say that the pacing of the game is spot-on, a huge difference from the 2020 version, which had pretty horrendous gameplay.
	Graphics: Pretty good.
	AI makes better tactical decisions.
Cons:
	Online: Takes way too long to find an online opponent, high latency.
	Bugs: Players randomly letting the ball slip by them, players with 80+ passing screwing up simple passes, CPU scoring off every free kick.
	CPU takes advantage of ""turn and shoot"" gimmick, my defender will be glued to the striker when suddenly the striker turns and shoots effortlessly while not even facing the goal, goes in 75% of the time.
	Fouls: BLATANT fouls being simply IGNORED by the referees.
	Goalkeepers: Please fix the animations. When they dive they look like they're flying like superman.
	More fitting styles for kits: The player models are good, but the shirt sizing is somewhat wonky, perhaps add a tight kit option that fits more snug to the torso.",1600970988,1600971744,False,99,6,0.807980477809906006,0,True,False,False

Well, it's not good at all.

- Players are sluggish, defenses are through the roof, AI suck. AI will ignore balls within their reach, they won't fight or attempt anything to catch balls passing nearby.
- No bundesliga. Like, the UCL winner isn't in the game...
- Why only english commentaries are available?
- Game is so grossly rigged it's absolutely ridiculous. AI will have unstoppable momentums and you can just sit and watch them score perfect goals, walking over your players. It was like that on PES 5, now 10 years later Konami still thinks it's a good gameplay feature.

All the new things included in pes 20 like first touch, ball physics, physical contact between players, game speed during the match, etc. are all things that have been revisited and perfected.
The AI of the players you don't have control over has improved dramatically, fewer random spaces in defense taking goals on stupid counter-attacks and also improved the referee (although not perfect yet).
All these improvements make pes 21 the perfect football simulation, pes 20 had already made a big leap, but pes 21 is a perfected title.

MyClub is fun as card-collecting mode. Game runs smoothly during gameplay* in 60FPS on a far from top PC (i-3 4160, R9 270, 8GB RAM DDR3) on medium settings. (Drops to 50-55 on high)

*excluding cutscenes/celebration close-ups, it's not a big issue since you don't control anything at those moments

Minuses: Online. Haven't found a match earlier than 10 minutes in yet. Connection tends to worsen A LOT during the match itself (and no, it's not an issue with my internet). MyClub has way less functions than FUT; and there aren't any special modes offline - player career, manager career, quickplay, that's about it.

$25 vs $70 is a good argument though



Summary: if you want to hop in once in a while, play a few games, maybe lead a club for a few seasons, make a nice squad in online card-collecting mode without the need for spending hundreds of bucks - take PES.

If you just want to grind/spend some money instead in an online mode, or have a wider choice of gamemodes - think you'd be better off getting FIFA.",1600387519,1600387519,True,12,0,0.642002224922180176,4,True,False,False

For those people looking to buy this game because of huge improvements in gameplay and other new features, you are going to be dissappointed. This as most of you may be aware is just a season update, hence no significant gameplay changes. So why should I upgrade from Pes 2020, you may ask? Well if you are looking to play online, then it is must. There are also tiny gameplay changes such as minor tweaks to passing and dribbling which make it bit more bearable. Another thing is the pitches have finally been realistically designed as opposed to the arcady pitches in 2020. The passing is totally realistic and feels more crisper this year compared to last year. The UI has been slightly more polished. For those who are solely interested in offline modes such as Master League, you will be dissappointed as they are largely the same as 2020.One con i can think of is the dribbling where players often run into each other instead of avoiding or going around them.; or when a slow ass player manages to outrun speedy players., This is one of the areas which MUST be addressed in PES 2022. Another issue is the shooting mechanic, specially the finesse/curling shots which still feel like slow motion. This is one area where PES can massively improve over FIFA. Finally the pricing of the game at £24.99/ $30 may feel like a bit much for just a season update. Personally I would have priced this around $5 dollar less but its not like FIFA every year where they make miniscule changes and charge a premium price.To sum up , Pros-1. Best Football Simulator in 2020.2. Passing is the best ever designed in a football game3. The customizations such as adding stadiums, teams and leagues as well as other stuff like scoreboards, adboards, chants etc.Cons- 1. Dribbling needs to be improved significantly.2. Shooting feels the same as 2020, like the slow motion curling shots3. Price of $30 may be a bit much for just minor changesOverall Rating - 7.5/10",1600283020,1600283020,True,1,0,0.519774019718170166,0,True,False,False

I tried to give one more chance to PES with the 2021, because basically FIFA went nuts with UT and ridicolous game modes like Volta (jeez that was seriously abysmal).

So this was more an act of desperation and... surprise, surprise...

this time it paid off at least about the gameplay. 

This new release imo is smooth and very close to what I played in the 2020 demo and for the first time in years I had fun playing with PES. 

There are some negative aspects that I noticed so far,the  lack of official licenses (is a war between Konami and EA), the referee whistle is so unnatural and the menu is counterintuitive.

 For example to exit to desktop ya gotta click options. 

The ML is nice, but the menu is awful at the best, the contents are nice and also a lot of good features to go in depth in the training to let your players grow as you desire, and this is FAR better than the lazy FIFA system. 

I will try to update this review, but if you are truly pissed off from EA laziness as I am, give to PES2021 a try!",1600210074,1600210267,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The game was great for 2020 and it still is. Had this game been full priced and tweaked then it would be getting negative reviews, but this simple update that I think should happen every year is a nice wee way to cap off 25 years of this beautiful football game. I do believe the master league needs updated as it is as was and yes a great improvement over yester-years but not much of a change from last year. Great music as always and perfect menu system and controlls. I will be looking forward to the next gen yearly games but hopefully they will consider this new update idea or atleast do it half way through a season to tweak an already great game.

Glad they have Bayern Edition, Love it!
Also great job KONAMI for adding Messi and Ronaldo on cover of this PES series.

Definitely this is an upgrade from 2020 with some new animations and more polished gameplay. Dirbbling, animation speed up just going so well and better than 2020.
