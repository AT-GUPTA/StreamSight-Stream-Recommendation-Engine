The ""New Game+"" feature allows you to start a second, harder replay with all of the weapons etc. from the first run.  Absolutely THE best apocalyptic Zombie game, story, and scenery ever created.  

As a Pacific Northwesterner, I find there are constantly places in the game I go to where I see something familiar, and have a WHOA moment that a famous waterfall or some other unique REAL place is actually on my screen and incredibly accurate.  (Like a certain bridge and double falls.  You know the one.  That poor lodge.)

Overview:  Motorcycling throughout central Oregon trying to help friends, save the world, find your girl, and rid the world of THEM.  Which unfortunately includes very realistic end-of-the world psychological impact, like fringe groups.  They are either trying to survive by theft and murder, trying to convert you to their pro-zombie cult, or trying to force you to join their mock militia with a crazy man.  All of them want to kill you and the other groups.

A disease has transformed normal people to mindless packhunting carnivorous 'freaks.'  There are hordes of them.  In advanced difficulty, hundreds and hundreds of them.  Let me officially say i hate the caves. BUT we're supposed to. 

Those moments are accented and crescendo'd by the musical score. WOW.  The mood the composer and sound people created when around freakers and hordes is terrifying, effective, and accurate / appropriate for the situation.  You never hear 'scary music' unless there is an 'oh crap' situation about to happen.  

Audio is critical in this game, including the sounds of the freaks, their voices.  Creepiest is the freaker girl who hums all the time.  Until she sees you...

AND i haven't mentioned your dead wife who you SWEAR isn't dead and keep searching for.  Due to possible evidence.  Is she alive? And if so, is she normal still?

About the slow start: SOME reviews say the game starts slow.  I can't imagine how you could start this game and this story by dropping right into the fray.  I believe they do an amazing job, as they build the characters, storyline, atmosphere, location, mechanics, etc. buy having you run missions for ingredients you may need, along with some cut scenes and interactions.  Meanwhile you watch your friend get sicker.  This first hour of play is designed to highlight the friendship you have with him, some history between them, and add the annoyance of the freakers, along with get used to locations, learn about camps, etc.

Once you meet the NPC recurring character LISA, everything hits like a kick in the gut.  The surprising emotional impact of this piece of art is astounding.  Once the game is over, you can keep playing the open world doing side-missions and discovering places.  I always do.  Big disappointment for me? not being able to truly interact with my NPC peers after the storyline is over.  In other words, i am disappointed that it is over.  It has a wonderful ending, but like any really really good movie, you don't want to leave, neither the world or the characters..

Motorcycle mechanic is great, especially having to repair and refuel frequently.  Great physics.  Hunting is also there and satisfying, as is the plethora of weapon types and creative explosive devices, with a little crafting  (i love the attractor bomb myself for horde-plosions).

The story, the interactions, the over-the-top character acting.  Absolutely love and relate to Deacon.  

As a Pac NW person, this game scratches every itch, many of which i didn't even know were there.

Cheers guys, congratulations.  5 stars, One of the best games I've ever played.  196 hours on record. Probably starting playthrough 3 soon.

+ Gameplay feels good, fights are nice
+ General mood of the game is nice

- There are radio tansmissions, and Deacon (main char), while alone somewhere in the wilderness always SHOUTS an angry, unreasonable answer into the void. That shouting totally breaks the game immersion

- Deacon has no character, just acts and reacts totally ""off"" on cutscenes
- Boozer calls randomly, has nothing to say and every conversation ends that he should be better gat another round of sleep
- The map has a bit of ""Ubisoft open world"" feeling, even if not that hard as it is done by ubisoft

- ALL conversations are just awfull, random reponses, partly conversations that sound like to different conv. mixed randomly, and if neither of the above, NO interaction at all between characters.",1708814631,1708814631,False,1,0,0.496183186769485474,0,True,False,False

I shit you not there are at least three bugs I know of that will completely end your playthrough, including one that may or may not happen *very* far into the game preventing all progress and zeroing dozens of hours of gameplay.

NPC's randomly teleport, randomly spawn, cutscenes happen out-of-order, dialog happens out-of-order, your character may just drop dead because you stumbled on a rock, your bike might randomly throw you off because it hit some tiny piece of geometry, enemy AI may just spin in place, interactions might get stuck, LOD changes might stop working, things may just not render in at all... the list goes on.

This is hands down the worst coded game I have played in years, don't be like me, I kept playing because of the sunk-cost fallacy ""Maybe it will get better, I am already so far in.""

Overall, good game. Its a mix mash of every feature in every game you have ever played and it does it well.
Graphically phenomenal. Best zombie game on the market that isnt some type of wave or tower defense. 
And it runs really well for what it is and extremely smooth. There is so much to see and do and so many things you are capable of interacting with. The best way to describe it is Red Dead meets Far Cry meets Survival. The only thing it doesnt have is base building, and thats the truth. 

Except the story telling is bonkers. The story was great until about the halfway or a little past that mark. Then some of the things in it just seem completely unnecessary, rushed, pointless, and so on. It drags the last few hours of the main story out so far it is not even funny. Realism is broken constantly by just stupid things like not making you wait a day or two for a mission to become available and what not. Details being  completely left out all over the place.

The biggest one being when you get to the militia no one puts two and two together that Sarah is your wife even though her name is plastered on your neck for the world to see. All around just poor and ignorant story telling and minor details that are overlooked that completely break story immersion.
 
Dont recommend this to anyone who cant stand obvious plot holes, because of all the games I have ever played this one has the most. 
Also the cut scenes are piss poor past the halfway point and dont do much to convey the emotions or gravity of certain situations at all.

It is obvious towards the end of production things got rushed and they didnt polish or work harder to match them to the beginning. 

Also the ending doesnt do the story justice, at least not the way the they tell it.",1708571506,1708571506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Days Gone delivers an adrenaline-pumping journey through a post-apocalyptic world that will leave players on the edge of their seats. Set in the stunning and perilous Pacific Northwest, this open-world adventure is a triumph in survival gaming.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Days Gone is its vast and meticulously crafted world. From dense forests to abandoned highways, every corner of the map is teeming with life, both human and infected. The dynamic weather system adds another layer of immersion, with rainstorms and fog dramatically altering the landscape and gameplay.

The heart and soul of Days Gone lie in its gripping gameplay mechanics. As protagonist Deacon St. John, players must navigate through hordes of ferocious Freakers while scavenging for resources and completing missions. The combat system is both intuitive and satisfying, offering a variety of weapons and tactics to dispatch enemies with precision.

Beyond its intense action sequences, Days Gone also shines in its narrative depth. The story of Deacon's quest for redemption is compelling, filled with poignant moments of loss and resilience. The emotional journey is further enhanced by stellar voice acting and captivating character development.

However, despite its many strengths, Days Gone does stumble slightly in its storytelling execution. While the overarching narrative is engaging, there are moments where pacing issues and predictable plot twists detract from the overall experience. Additionally, some side quests feel disconnected from the main storyline, leading to a sense of disjointedness in the narrative flow.

Despite this minor setback, Days Gone remains a must-play title for fans of survival and action-adventure games. With its breathtaking world, thrilling gameplay, and emotional storytelling, it stands as a testament to the power of immersive gaming experiences. Strap in, gear up, and prepare to embark on an unforgettable journey through the apocalypse.",1708558214,1708558214,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game loop is neither fun nor realistic, and succeeds only in being unnecessarily frustrating and immersion breaking with silly gimmicks like 'tracker mode' that highlights items in your immediate area. 

There are arbitrary game mechanics that simply don't work. For instance, you can find all manner of weapons out in the field, but unless you purchase them from a camp, you won't be able to retrieve them from your gun locker for reuse. 

Melee weapons like machetes and axes have such low durability that they break after only a few hits, forcing you to find another. Likewise, your dirt bike will run out of gas every two minutes, and require repairs every 5. It's not that finding things in the world is particularly difficult -- there are things all over the place. It's that the gameplay loop is arbitrary and forced. It feels more like padding to make up for the lack of gameplay than anything else.

The AI is pretty poor as well, with enemies losing you in a foot tall bush when they're three meters behind you. Not to mention the fact that you're having a full-on conversation over your walkie talkie while they search for you. Yea right. And the 'zombies' appear to spawn out of nowhere in all directions. You'll never feel like you've cleared an area. 

The environment is completely drab and sterile, constantly raining as part of the forced ambiance, as you ride your fuel guzzling dirt bike along a predetermined mini-map path to your next objective a few hundred meters away. And there's nothing like a big ""Leaving Mission Area"" warning plastered over your screen as a reminder that the devs are in control here, not you. 

There are so many better game options out there that don't force players into an inescapable box, that I can't recommend playing this one. And while the game may get better over time as some reviews have pointed out, why should I have to wait for a game to get good? It should be good from the start.

The graphics are excellent. It might have been better if the player were able to customize their avatar a bit, but overall this is the biggest criticism I can muster. 

The gameplay is excellent, at least on PC. I have also tried to play the game via controller and, at least with Playstation, the interface is a little clunky. I definitely recommend mouse and keyboard.

The story is excellent, if linear. You have no meaningful choices in this game and there is no opportunity to customize your persona, morally. However, the story is full of compelling characters and interesting twists.

As an initial foray into Open World CRPGs, this is an outstanding achievement and Bend Studios deserved more support from Sony in their pitch for a Days Gone 2. There is, in fact, a petition that one can access here:

So I'm choosing to review the game and not Sony, and this is a good game with a good story and good combat.  It's the perfect mix of melee and ranged combat and they don't just hand out weapons that straight up annihilate... you are working for it, always.  Riding the bike is pretty nice also.  I love games like Skyrim and Fallout but I always have to take a break because I get a little bored, that's just me.  With Days Gone that did not happen.

Compelling story line, great game play mechanics, and graphically polished.  I definitely recommend this game to any one a fan of zombie shooters and open world action/survival.  I am definitely a fan of zombie genre, and the zombies in this game are well done.  Not slow, meandering corpses (though that is the definition in some cases), these not-undead creatures are challenging.   You see, the ""zombies"" are just mutated humans who were infected and mutated into mindless flesh eating freaks. 

The game mechanics forces you into a run/duck scenario when the hoard is stampeding you and, what makes it fun, are the strategic environmental 'traps' you can use to your advantage, requiring some cunning and some strategy.  Overall well done.

UPDATE:  On first review, I gave my initial impressions and I will update this review to conclude this is probably the most underrated game I have played in quite some time.  The game released to unrelenting poor reviews which perplexes me, I found most of the criticisms to be off-base or flat out wrong.  I stand by my original impression, now being about 1/2 way through the game.    The story had me in the beginning, and I did not find it slow or cliche' as many reviewers did (I feel the negative criticisms of the story has more to do with the lunatic politics of the time rather than actual quality of story telling).  The world is detailed and beautifully rendered.  The game play is varied and enemies are diverse -- from zombie nests, to marauders, snipers, and hordes.  The crafting/survival elements are well balanced, not overtly complicated, and adds to the story/environment.  I do appreciate the skill tree and the progression system is well intertwined into the world and story progression.  I, frankly, rank this up there with the genre greats like L4D2 (though a completely different gaming approach, I am enjoying it as I did L4D2) or the Resident Evil type games.   I particularly like the zombies, the behavior, the models, skins and looks... contrast that to the cartoonish look of Back 4 Blood zombies... ugghhh. 

I for one vote for a sequel.  I would love another game of this.... just superb.  Playstation exclusives are incredibly good and since I do not like console gaming and do not own a PS4 or 5, I am glad Sony ported this over... well done.

Update 2:  Finished the game.  If you go through the main story threads, and skip the camp jobs and bounty hunter missions (which is hard to do since you need to build camp trust and credits to proceed), you can count on 40-50 hours of game play, if you play out all the details more like 60-75 hours of game play.  It does not matter, all I can say is WOW.  One of the best stories and finishes to a game, loved it all.",1630191122,1708373003,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Overall, the story is good, the core gameplay is fun. Took me around 35h to beat the main story while running around and doing some side quests as well. 

Ammo is pretty scarce at first, but as soon as you unlock some upgrades to your character and bike ammo is not really an issue anymore. Overall when going through the story I had a ton of issues when NPC's would radio you constantly a second before a cutscene is being played. Sometimes just arriving to a location pops a cutscene and it also cuts out radio from other NPC's. IDK if it's a bug or just poor coding, but it definitely annoyed me that the radio would come up during fights, a second before a cutscene, at odd and weird times and what not. Sometimes it was impossible to listen to story coming through the radio because an NPC decided it's a good time to radio me while I was taking down a horde. 

Stealth is almost non-existence in this game. As soon as the enemies are up to you they will not lose track of you. Only form of stealth is to use silencers or try to take the NPC's 1 by 1 with melee kills from their back but.. it's just not effective and useless since ammo isn't scarce anyways. The aiming is poor though since you have to wait for the crosshair to shrink to be accurate. Most guns aren't so accurate without focus on long range. A bit annoying but since ammo isn't an issue after the early game it's not that bad.

Overall, aside the radio issues I had a fun going through the story but don't expect TLOU level of story.

Don't get me wrong. It's a great game over all. BUT: It has game breaking bugs.
Not game breaking as in some weird glitches. Game breaking like in game won't load into the next cut scene bugs. I can not refund, so I am in for the wild patch ride. Hoping some day a wild patch will appear fixing my game.

So much potential wasted. Sad.

EDIT 18.02.2024:

Game now runs ok. No mayor game breaking bugs as far as I can tell.
So far so good, but there are other problems:

The game is boring, repetitive and unimaginative. It's artificially drawn out, making the story worse and worse. The characters are flat and seem mentally handicapped at times.

Normie zombie, fast zombie, bullet sponge zombie, and so on.

Missions with an NPC are pure hell, you get tons of walking sessions where Deek shuffles like one of the zombies from the Thriller song. You get a cutscene for every small thing, from opening a door to strapping something on your bike. It breaks the entire tempo up, way too many cutscenes. 


Story missions are sandbox and usually revolve around the same: ride here, kill this, ride here gather this but kill this first.

The only missions that are somewhat fun without the hassle of constant cutscenes is burning nests and killing hordes/camps. You can get nice RNG events like a horde coming because of your gunfire, or a bear or whatever.

There are a few good missions in there, the mission where you have to gather cinnabar is good because there are barely any cutscenes and just gameplay albeit it the same boring cycle of combat.

This is not a horrible game, the devs put their effort in but it's just more slop, it doesn't take risks, it's all safe and handholding, it has this cinematic narrative telling everything like you are a boneheaded mongloid, which I get it, most of these Z-gamers are inept and of low erudite.

More gameplay and environmental storytelling, less dialogue and less handholding.
I'll watch The Walking Dead if I want to succumb to boredom.

Due to recent and constant crashing, this junkware doesn't even start up anymore, that is how SHIT this game is, it doesn't even want to start anymore.

- constant crashing and freezing
- you alt tab the game and you get texture pop ins and random crashes.
- unoptimized

After the last crash, the start up just remains a black void, much like what I feel for this game.

The characters are mostly well written (Colonel Garrett notwithstanding) and superbly well acted. The combat works well enough not to be a nuisance, but it's not smth to get addicted to either.

The main thing that sets this game apart from The Last of Us is that it's an open world sandbox adventure. So if you're tasked with clearing a group of human enemies, you can just draw a zombie horde to them and have the horde do all the dirty work for you. Which is extremely fun. The AI is pretty stupid for the most part, but not to the point that it ever breaks the flow of the game.

The open world is extremely pretty to look at and the dynamic weather and day/night cycle add to the experience. Except for the snow, which pales in comparison to 2016's The Division. It looks serviceable, but it's nowhere near as atmospheric.

There's a secret ending which I won't spoil here, but you gotta clear every single last horde on the map, of which there are a lot, to unlock it. Which might not be worth it, knowing that it baits a sequel which Sony has denied. But if you enjoyed the horde clearing in the main story, then it's a good excuse to revisit the game from time to time for an hour or two.

At its core, this game is an ode to the survival genre, delivering an unparalleled story that grips you from the slow burn of its beginning to its intense, heart-pounding conclusion.

The game sets you loose in a vast expanse of Oregon's wilderness, a backdrop that's both beautiful and merciless. The sense of freedom you get riding your bike across this open world is unmatched. It's not just about the ride; it's about the survival, exploration, and the stories that unfold on this journey.

Combat in ""Days Gone"" is a testament to the game's attention to detail and its dedication to delivering a visceral experience. Whether you're swinging a melee weapon or firing a gun, the combat feels grounded and satisfying. The inclusion of craftable traps and items adds a layer of strategy that elevates encounters beyond mere brute force, making each confrontation with the undead a thrilling test of wit and will.

Speaking of the undead, facing down hordes of zombies is as exhilarating as it is challenging. It's a feature that will test your mettle, keep you on your toes, and offer the kind of satisfaction only found in overcoming overwhelming odds.

I'm running this masterpiece on an i9-13900k processor with 64GB of RAM and an Nvidia RTX4070 TI, and the performance is flawless. ""Days Gone"" is exceptionally well-optimized for PC, ensuring that your journey through the apocalypse is as seamless as it is enthralling.

In conclusion, ""Days Gone"" is a 10/10 in my book. It's a game that demands patience at the start but rewards you with an experience that's as profound as it is thrilling. It's not just a game; it's an adventure that tests your spirit, challenges your skills, and ultimately, tells a story of humanity at its most raw and resilient.

Played it on hard difficulty. No regrets.  Learning curve was hard, but fun.  The game is an amazing balance of hope and hopelessness, love and jump scares, friends to foes, foes to friends; just amazing writing.  

Many of the twists were predictable, but I didn't care because t;he twists gave me what I wanted/needed and allowed for closure, and kept me from resenting the game.  So, thank you to the writers that chose the paths you did.

That said, I don't see replay-ability in this game and I think you have to love it once for what it was, and then walk away, and remember it fondly.  Un-like MW3, CoD and the like that have tremendous soul-crushing replay-ability.  

I'm not one to watch all the cut scenes, but I found myself becoming emotionally invested in the main characters, their backstories, and their story arcs.  

Build up your bike for speed and performance, unlock character trees offering a myriad of abilities, or build zombie wrecking melee weapons that would earn you a war crimes trial.  So awesome.  So graphic. 

Nom Nom. 

There is a buffet of firearms for Primary, Secondary, and 'Special'.  Probably a thousand or so different firearm combinations to fit every gamer play style.   Ranged stealth assassin? Sure.  Bruiser Juggernaut? We can do that too.  Shotguns everywhere? Done.

I'm generally hard on games, and seem to have high expectations that few games can live up to.  

This game exceeded expectations. The writing staff, the programmers, the actors and their co-workers really have created something special here.

Fully, and emotionally, endorsed.

Note -- Things I would like to see from this game - online co-op, and/or closed map pvp against zombies and players, freestyle compound building similar to fallout 4, but with the ability to grant compound abilities through structures like in State of Decay.

There are a lot of restrictions that looked normal at the beginning of 2000. 
1) There is no jump. You can climb and pull yourself up only in places allowed by the developers. You can't climb an obstacle below the knee and have to go around a large piece of cards.
2) Terrible melee physics. 
3) A crooked and inconvenient interface. 
4) Very monotonous gameplay. 
5) The dumb intelligence of the opponents. 
6) No challenge. 
7) There are no points of interest on the map. 
8) There is no equipment upgrade. 
9) An empty open world. 
10) Artificial stretching of playing time:
Running for cans. 
The number of portable cartridges is very limited. 
Weapons break too often. It takes a lot of time to collect garbage to fix weapons. 
The gameplay with a knife (apparently it is rubber because there is no damage) can be described as follows:
Punch, punch, punch, somersault, punch, somersault, punch, punch, somersault, punch, punch, punch, somersault, somersault, punch, punch. I ran out of stamina. Our character does not have adrenaline, so we run at the speed of a legless invalid and save up stamina. Hit. 

The game is not about survival - it is not here. The game is not about action - there is no point in killing zombies. It's much easier and faster to get past them. If you don't touch them, then they don't touch you, and you don't need to kill them. There is only junk in the houses that is needed to fix the garage for ""battles"" With zombies. Loot is enough to kill 1-2 zombies, and then collect garbage again to fix weapons. 1-2 zombies again and collect garbage again and so on endlessly. Just the most boring grind.

I've played quite a few zombie games in my time but Days Gone was on a level I couldn't have predicted. I thought it'd be good from the high praise and ratings but not THIS good. If you're more into the ""pick up 'n shoot without a strong narrative"" type of game, you may want to stay clear of this one as it's a long game with an amazing story to tell. The story and cast are so well written I'd even recommend this game to RPG/JRPG players. Aside from 1 or 2 bugs I've nothing bad to say. Controls feel really good, the music score is great, combat is thrilling and varied, the PC port is near flawless and runs with the grace of a gazelle.

The story is a LITTLE slow to start but it's worth it. It's a long game so let it set itself. I've never played a zombie game before where my sense of purpose in the world was this grand. I played the game on Hard difficulty and it wasn't really tough at all, but as an RPG player I love to level grind so maybe I was just always OP. Hordes are really something else, but I found that even the biggest hordes could be brought down with some basic planning, either entirely through stealth or a full on frontal assault. Some of the ways I beat certain hordes honestly felt like cheating lol, like I discovered an exploit. I put off playing this game for a while cuz I thought it'd be good but mostly the run of the mill. Boy was I wrong.

So I picked Days Gone up. And despite its negatives, id say so far i can see the potential and would welcome anyone else looking to survive against zombies to this game.

I've played the first two hours on steam, played a few hours on ps4 and watched a few hours of gameplay so Ill give an initial impression and then update later:

The zombies:This game has original and interesting zombies, they're fast which might put a lot of people off but the game balances that quite well by making them easy enough to outsmart... albeit a lot of the time you outsmarting the zombies is more like just figuring out the limitations of the games AI and using that to run rings around the zombies. I think overall the zombies are decent and more consistent that a lot of other games. I am surprised though that the zombies wern't patched after release once the developers saw how easily us players can take advantage of flaws in their pathfinding, line of sight and world interactivity protocols (or whatever AI programming is called). Im a relative noob and my tactic with them is to get up high and knock them repeatedly off a ledge as they climb up one at a time.

The cutscenes: Voice acting is good, script seems actually well written, grounded and not too cliche or over the top like a lot of games nowerdays but Immediately the thing that'll stick out like a sore thumb for gamers is the lack of seamless transitions between cutscenes and gameplay. Its almost like the team who did the cut-scenes were told that the game engine could handle seamless transitions but it only became apparent after all the cut-scenes were coded that the game engine couldn't so they just filmed cutscenes and then stuck them awkwardly into the game by cutting to black and hoping the scenes match up with what you were doing. These awkward transitions are very distracting and break all the tension and the annoying part is that most of the early cutscenes are just unneeded as a voice over would have achieved the same things.

The gameplay: The core game looks and feels great its like a blend between dying light and The last of us. 

Ubisoft inspirations take so much away:  there are some questionable design choices beyond the core mechanics which cheapen the experience unnecessarily like the fact that the bike has a arcade game boost and drift buttons, there are farcry style influences awkwardly placed everywhere the worst of which are the settlements with ubisoft style generic shop and service NPCs stalls everywhere with absolutely no soul or sense of reality. I think this producer just figured that that is what people like, I actually think if theyd kept things simple and concentrated on the story and core gameplay people would have ate it up.

Bugs and gamebreaking mechanics: There are a few bugs and poor coding here and there but nothing that would have caused many complaints day one of release. But we re sitting here some 4 years after the game was released and from what ive seen barely anything was addressed. There are a lot of stutters, weird glitchy movements and transitions which arnt too bad but one big gamebreaking design choice everyone needs to know about is the game giving you a manual save and a quicksave which appear to work no matter what youre doing (the game literally does look like its saving) but they only work when youre next to a bed or your bike. if you save and quit after a long gaming session but not next to a bike or bed you will not notice that the game hasnt actually saved and  you will be reverted back to the beginning of your current mission with nothing retained at all. The fact that 4 years later there is still a save button in the pause menu is mental, there should be a save button on the motorbike and the beds and nowhere else.

I think if they had not used pre filmed cutscenes (and used live in engine cutscenes like every modern game), got rid of the ubisoft-isms, the random zombie nests and other weird repetitive side objectives, fixed the bugs, listened to the fan feedback and gave the settlements a more natural survivor feel instead of the soulless Ubisoft settlement approach, this game would have been a chart topper and I can now see why people speak about the potential of this game more than how good it actually is, because it is actually good. And I look forward to exploring it in its entirety.

How to begin this chapter. Story of days gone is phenomenal. I love it. It’s full of plot-twists, hatred, love....it has everything. It is definitely the strongest aspect of the game. I’ve never played a zombie game which has as great story as Days Gone (yeah it’s true I did not play many Zombie-story-driven singleplayer games buuuuut it doesn’t matter) What I particulary like about the story are the plot-twists mentioned earlier. They are extremely unexpected. I had no idea that the story will take this turn and this will happen. I managed to predict it in couple of games which I’ve played before. So thumbs up Bend Studio. Story begins with the 2 bikers – Deacon St. John who is the main protagonist of Days Gone, his friend Boozer and a Deacon’s wife Sarah. It’s directly during the start of the zombie apocalypse in Oregon. Sarah get’s stubbed by little infected child and Deacon and Boozer are looking for help for Sarah. They manage to find a NERO helicopter, Nero Stands for - National Emergency Response Organization, and Deacon with Boozer puts Sarah in that helicopter to save her. Unfortunately they can’t go with her because there are only 2 free places which one of them is for Sarah. So Deacon as the best husband ever prefers bros before hoes. He goes with Boozer who is also injured but it’s not that critical as Sarah is. Then Deacon and Sarah agree on meeting in a refugee camp and after this, the chopper leaves. After this prologue the game officialy starts. The story continues 2 years forward to present day when both Deacon and Boozer don’t believe that Sarah had survived the flight. I am not going to continue, don’t worry I don’t want to spoil you the beauty of Deacon’s adventure.
2. Quests
So basicaly quest are devided in 2 main lines. Just like in any other open world game, there are main quests and side quests. Main quests are really nice, they are varied and are not that repetitive or at least it seems to me that way. But I can’t say this about the side quests. There are varius of side quests from destroying enemy camp to looking for a hostage and so on. These quests are repetitive and they are called jobs. In Days Gone there are several camps that will offer you these jobs and when you complete them you’ll earn some trust and some camp credits. Higher the trust the more and better items you can buy with these camp credits. Each camp has it’s own currency but don’t get me wrong it’s easy to see how much camp credits you have in each settlement it’s not confusing at all. Okay enough about the camps let’s go back to the side quests. Like I said they are repetitive and there are so many of them I don’t even have idea how many of them I’ve completed. If you are grinding only these before main line you might get bored but when you mix it, it is tolerable and you’ll probably don‘t to get bored by them. 
3. Combat and upgrades
There are 3 different types of combat. Combat against human enemies, combat against freaks (those are the zombies in Days Gone’s terminology) and fighting the animals. There are various type of different enemies from each of these groups. The most challenging is fight with freaks. You can meet many and when I say many I mean many freaks together and this is called a Horde. In the earlier stages of the game they’ll kick your ass with no problem but further it’ll became easier and easier to hunt them down. But you can still be stupid asshole like me and still get killed by them. Jk they are pretty challenging even in end-game, speaking mostly about the bigger Hordes. Human enemies are in some way special too. They set up ambushes and if you don’t pay enough attention, you can end up directly in their trap like I did several times. They are not difficult to defeat but they can shake with your health and resources. They also settled down in many camps around the map. I don’t have any problems with enemies and their AI but sometimes they act stupidly and really weird. I‘ve spoken about the combat but I haven’t told you yet how to upgrade Deacon to kill enemies easier and faster. Deacon can be upgrading by 2 different ways. The first one is often used and it’s via perks. Each perk need to be purchased by skill points. You can earn skill points after required amount of XP. You can earn XP by doing main and side missions, killing enemies and other stuff. Does it sound too complicated? Don’t worry you’ll understand it when you’ll dive into Days Gone yourself.  Anyway these perks will make your life easier in the Wilderness of Oregon. There is also another way to upgrade Deacon. That is via NERO injectors which you can find in NERO camps scattered around the map. When you find an injector you can upgrade health, stamina or a focus. So they are basicaly passive skills. You may ask what a Focus is, aaaaaaand that’s a really nice feature. When in combat you can press a button and time slows down for some time and you can aim for heads more easily. But not only Deacon can be upgraded. You can also upgrade his best friend, his bike. Bike can be upgraded in certain settlements. Bike is used to travel around the open world of Oregon. Speaking of travelling......
4. Game World
Game world is extremely and I really mean extremely huge. It’s filled with various activities from destoying bandit camps, burning out freaker nests to killing hordes. What I really like about the game world activities are the random encounters you may face when driving from point A to point B. You may found some people in need and when you help them you can send them to camp you have previously discovered and you’ll receive some trust points or camp credits. These encounters are really nice part of open world and they keep it a little more alive. What also keeps the open world alive are random ambushes like I mentioned earlier. I bet you’ll definitely get ambushed at least once. It’s great way to keep the world more alive.  If I should say something about the world itself I would definitely say that it’s various and vibrant. There are many types of biomes, from Oregon’s forests through destroyed areas to snowy regions. I loved just driving aroung and experiencing the beauty of the world. The Bend Studio did amazing job in this part.
5. Audio, Optimization, Graphics and bugs
This side of days gone is also on really high level. I don’t have any problems with these aspects of the game. It runs smoothly, I think only once in 50 hour playtime I experienced FPS drop, apart from this I haven’t encountered any lags or FPS drops. As for graphics I have no problem with it. It looks really nice and like I mentioned earlier I really enjoyed driving in this world and graphic side was one reason why. Audio is also great I don’t have any problems with that I genuienly enjoyed auditional aspect of the game.  As for bugs I haven’t encountered many. Sometimes I managed to see really really stupid NPC but it did not happened often. I haven’t experienced any crashes or game breaking bugs which completely ruined my experience.
6. Final Verdict
Days Gone is really solid and decent game experience. I really enjoyed it. At the first I was not sure if I should buy it or not but now I don’t regret the purchase. It was worth it. Really amazing game with great graphics, audio, emotional story, great enemies....I could be talking about the possitives so long. There were also some negatives like stupid AI bugged enemies............ or the game missions sometimes seemed unneccessary, like just to be there. But these mistakes are just a little scratches on this amazing title and I rate it 9,5/10. I recommend you to play even now in 2024. You will not regret buying and experiencing Deacon’s adventure.",1707764907,1707764907,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Overview:[/b]
- This is an old PS4 game from 2019. If you want to experience mediocre open world games made back in those days, this game ticks all the check box. 
- However this game aged like milk. For today's standard of gaming, this game is really boring, lackluster, and straight up felt like a chore.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Great graphic and sound effect. Picturesque landscape and scenery.
- Realistic looking humans, zombies, animals, vehicles etc.
- Good combat mechanism. No bullet spamming like most zombie games.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Inconsistency in every aspect. As if the game is made by different teams and then patched together with a duct tape, or - the developers suffers from ADHD or bipolar disorder. 
- The main character personality is just weird. Sometimes he is kind and attentive, sometimes he is a A-hole for no reason, sometimes he acts like he is a badass, sometimes he acts like he is sad for no reason. Yeah I get it, he behaves like this because he thinks that he lost his loved one due to his mistake. But the moment I start emphasizing, boom! random cringey A-hole moment! It's like trying to yawn after a long day only to get b-tch slapped out of nowhere. 
- The flow of the game is horrible. One moment you are having extremely intense combat with zombies, struggling to survive. One moment you are doing stealth trying to avoid getting spotted. One moment you are running around from point A to point B with literally nothing in sight. One moment you get ambushed out of nowhere. One moment you are savaging for craps. One moment you get hit with cheap jump scares. One moment you are hit with some random dialogue/cutscenes with forced slow walking. One moment you are running around again. And worst of all, the transitions felt extremely forced and inorganic. 
- Speaking of running around, this mechanism is literal time waster and act as a filler to artificially bloat the game length. Running 400m with nothing interesting along the way, just to reach a destination for something to happen, is just not fun. Sure there are zombies along the way but things are only interesting for the first couple of times. From there onward it's just felt like repetitive filler quests.
- Scavenging and crafting - insert monkey see monkey react meme here. All you do is hit right stick, interact with everything that pings. And no you can't ignore this feature because if you do, you'll be missing out on ammo, scraps or even healing items. 
- Incredibly slow pacing. Friend's arm hurt > find medicine > got interrupted by some NPCs. More than thrice. > go to some random camp > smash some zombies > run back. Entire process took 1.5 hours. If this isn't tormenting I don't know what is. From most reviews, it will take around 60 hours to complete just the main story. If I were 5 years younger I would probably have the patience for this nonsense. But today, hell no, I have better games to play.
- Camera follow player is on by default. Fortunately I googled and found the solution to turn this off. However I suffered from motion sickness and nausea within the first 30 mins in game. No idea how people enjoy the default settings but everything I do, shakes the camera. Run - Camera shake. Shoot, bullet recoil - Camera shake. Roll - Camera shake. Got hit - Camera shake. The entire experience was beyond frustrating.
 
[b]Conclusion:[/b]
- Below average game. Don't expect GTA, RDR or even Assassin Creed experience because this game is no way near any of those. Hell even death stranding, a game with literally a handful of NPCs, is more interesting than this crap. 
- Combat is fun and intense for the first 5-10 times. Then it gets repetitive and old very quickly. 
- At 75% discount, this game is still not worth it. Won't recommend it even if the discount is at 100%. No, even if you pay me to play this, I still won't.",1707751184,1707751184,False,4,0,0.469955325126647949,0,True,False,False

All the consumables have their place and I find myself using them often. There is stealth gameplay that I feel is better as well, even emergent gameplay like animals attacking zombies, zombies attacking people and even people attacking their own people if you use the right items. The collection system is very cool, as Bend Studio is actually based in Oregon and so is the Game. So signs and locations have a real world history and location, very cool. I open the collections menu to read context every time I find something new and I look it up on the browser online to learn even more. Oregon itself has intense natural beauty. 

The story is quite good and impressionable. I adore seeing Sam Witwer again after my time with Force Unleashed. I have no Idea what IGN or other mean when they say its disconnected, I feel very much like the world is on its last leg when I play. The level design itself is amazing, all the props have accurate representation and I have learned a thing or two about building natural shelters.

Thank god I pay the absolute minimum I could for this game because I'd be very pissed if I paid full price.

The pacing is god awful, characters will go against or completely change their personality to progress the plot, it's like they're mentally lost or I have been left out of the loop for several years as to why they would behave that way, it's just bizarre. 

However, the combat is fun, specifically mowing down hoards. Killing people NPC's isn't as satisfying, as mostly all enemy NPC'S die to one shot to the head (playing on survival btw) unless they're something like a bear, tanky freak or armoured npc.

Crafting and gathering is kinda cool, eventually you're just always topped up on resources though so it's not really ever an issue. Only issue is the jarring cutscenes for gathering meat from animals or plants, so I end up not collecting it.

Visuals are great, especially if you play on survival as the hud is hidden, unless you use your survival sense or w.e it is. Makes for great cinematic shots especially when you're riding your bike, talking about the bike, very cool, feels good to manoeuvre even on K&M.",1707560460,1707560460,False,1,0,0.500320315361022949,0,True,False,False

In its favor the game does look great, the sound track is fantastic and the story is admittedly very good, and at first I was very engrossed in it but for some reason the twists and turns ultimately felt unsatisfying to me, although could just be a personal thing. The main problem though is that for anyone who has played even a few open world games this is just going to feel very 'meh'. The only thing this game brings to the table that other games haven't done—which plenty of people have pointed out already—is dealing with hordes, which definitely can be fun and a challenge, but is still not enough to make this game stand out from the huge crowd of similar games that people could be buying instead. I honestly just felt this was more or less Far Cry 5 but with better graphics, it felt so similar. In the unlikely case you've never played an open world game before this might be for you, but for anyone who hasn't been living under a rock then I'd suggest investing your money in the innumerable other better options that are out there.",1707548638,1707548690,False,1,0,0.514594018459320068,0,True,False,False

I went in thinking this game was going to rely 100% on zombie hordes based off all trailers, clips, and screenshots I saw, but with a lackluster campaign in return. I was very pleasantly surprised at how wrong I was on that.

The main character is super likable and has you rooting for him right away. Which I can’t say for most games I’ve played. I actually felt bad whenever things wouldn’t work out in his favor throughout the campaign. This also applies for the majority of the side characters. Even if they weren’t all “good guys,” most of them were really well written and still had qualities you didn’t hate.

The map is deceivingly large. At times it feels dull because the flat colors and (obvious) apocalyptic setting, but with unexpected zombie encounters and additional encounters, it doesn’t make it a chore to travel and found myself only using fast travel twice during my whole play through.

The individual zombie types and hordes were easily some of best zombies in comparison to anything I’ve played in the past. Their mechanics are designed to perfectly match the game’s pace and areas. Each horde was unique and every one of them made my heart rate get up with adrenaline.

The campaign is a treat. It’s very rare that a main campaign is so full of missions with a high completion time frame. I picked this up on sale and couldn’t believe how much of a game I got for the money. One of the few single player games in modern time I could have justified paying full price for on release day.

There’s only two reoccurring downsides that I kept being reminded of…The first is how unnecessary a lot of the actual campaign missions are. Which I realized is a pretty common gripe while scrolling through negative reviews for the game. So many times I found myself annoyed by driving across the map just to get a cutscene. This sort of thing happened constantly and it became annoying very early on. 

My second biggest downside is the overall ending arch to the campaign. The actual conclusion to the story is great. But the process to get there is grueling. More times than I could count I would feel like I was wasting so much doing nothing in order for the ending to be milked as slow as possible. The entire last section of the game took me around 5-6 hours to complete because of all the extra hoops you have to jump through. This was definitely my biggest complaint from the entire game. But even then, I’m not too upset because the ending paid off.

If you’re a fan of zombie/apocalypse games, this is an absolute must play. If you are looking for a game that you can get at a low sale price and get the most value for your money, this is your game. I highly recommend across the board.",1707506702,1707506702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLDR -  Days gone offers a great story but its gameplay is in need of refinement and variety. 

The good
Having grown up around bikers and motorcycle clubs ( MC going forward ) and a big fan of Sons of Anarchy I was pretty surprised to see a story driven zombie game featuring a 1%er enforcer named Deacon as the story's protagonist the game somewhat revolves around the MC obviously being a zombie game society as we know it has collapsed so you won't be riding with everyone but you do get one of my favourite supporting characters Boozer a Sgt at arms who acts as the yin to Deacon's yang. You get lots of great moments with these two weather it be Deacon & Boozer reminiscing about the past with the MC or people they used to know and coming to terms with some of the difficult choices and not to mention trauma both of them have had to endure throughout their two years on the road their sense of brotherhood with each other is unmistakable. In summary, regarding the story it does it's job well characters are well written sometimes they are a bit irrational or even walking stereotypes just for the sake of progressing the plot but the game's story heavily leans on drama and it works well. I was a bit sad to see you can't customize Deacon in any way but you can pimp out your bike with better parts and different paints which was pretty cool the game also looks pretty good for a ps4 game maybe not as sharp as other games that were coming out when Days gone did but not bad for a console first game. There is so much more I could talk about regarding the story because it really is good but I want to keep this review spoiler free but to wrap up I got to praise the game for it's music choice the soundtrack is good but in one specific ride with Boozer it's a pretty emotional one and you get Jack Savoretti's soldiers eyes which really nails the moment home for sure one of my favourite rides of the game

The bad
The #1 biggest criticism I have for this game is it's draconian and invasive privacy policy not only does it take system information which I would be fine with but even in the ""limited"" data collection it states that it can look and save anything from websites and passwords and even record your keystrokes while the game is running. And the reason for all this? just to make sure you are not aimbotting or otherwise cheating in a singleplayer game it makes even less sense because not to say that I made use of this but some simple googling will show you an abundance of cheats and mods for the game from places like WeMod. The word is this crap can be blocked via firewall but sadly for me the game would CTD when I did so I had to put up with it but if you do buy the game I 100% recommend that you atleast try. Another big criticism I have is the game is very repetitive even during story missions you'll be doing jobs that would normally be a side gig stuff like bounty hunting or clearing out infected nests for example and it just makes the gameplay feel like a slog after 20 hours of doing this kind of thing I was burnt out and had to give the game a break you feel this the most in the third major part of the map by the time you get to it you've most likely done just about everything the previous parts had to offer and this map expansion opens up and not only adds a bunch more meaningless stuff ( in terms of story ) but it adds more to the areas you have already beaten ( horde killing ) I for one had zero motivation to do any of it and just did the story missions which already have this side content in them to begin with. I'm also gonna briefly touch on horde killing because it is such a pain to do and you have to do it for some story missions and it is awful you basically have to kill 100+ zombies who once they hear you fire a single round are gonna come running at you like the dinner bell just rang you also have limited stamina meaning once they start swarming you it's over the only way you really can beat them is by planing a bunch of resource which can be hard to find heavy equipment like traps and spamming molotovs like your life depends on it and even after all that there still will be quite a few stragglers I really wish they did literally anything else. Another minor gripe I have is the bike it still feels really slow after you get all the upgrades and have nitro considering how much ground you have to cover in the game I really feel that a more substantial speed boost is needed I do think they did this because some parts of the story are just radio calls that you do while you are travelling but out of those specific circumstances it does feel like a slog.",1707423045,1707423239,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have to find kerosene to make Molotov cocktails despite having huge gas supply near your watchtower. You cannot jump but you can craft pipe bomb while running. List goes on.

A lot of artificial gameplay extending. I get the idea - at the beginning you are supposed to feel weak and poor, but scraping and crafting aspect makes early game tedious. It gets less annoying after some upgrades are available, but still...

Hordes are wasted potential. Yes, they are both scary and fun. But as endgame activity all you do to kill them is run in circles throwing grenades and using automatic riffles. There are traps and lures available but constructing them means boring searching for ingredients. So every horde kill is very schematic. Top up ammo, top up grenades, throw, run, throw run, yawn, shoot, run, throw, yawn, run. I'd love to see more environmental opportunities to deal with them.

Enough complaining, time for good stuff.

Story is engaging. We meet a lot of rough characters on our journey. Especially camp leaders that have to make difficult decisions to stay alive and protect their people. Freakers are not the only danger, without law enforcement weird cults raised their heads. I don't want to spoil much here, but characters and plot are strong point of this game.

I generally recommend it, but you have to be patient. From my 61 hours total at least 30 were wasted on popping car hoods and collecting rags.",1707344553,1707344553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But action-wise, not great. The character movement is cumbersome and not super responsive. There is an occasional bug that prevents you from aiming a gun. It's so fucking annoying when the zombie hordes are running at you and a quick response is needed. You press and hold the right click... and your character is just standing still doing nothing. I even replaced my mouse thinking it might have got old. But no, it's a bug in this game. Also irritating is when you try to open a chest by pressing E and see your character walk off to a totally different direction. Something is off about the coordination of interactive objects and character animation.

Also there is a bug that prevents you from progressing the story line entirely. It happened early on for me (in a mission where you pick up your first injection shot) so I could grudgingly start over. But imagine you spend hours and hours into this game before getting stuck for a stupid bug. So be advised, save as often as you can and keep multiple save files.

Days Gone is a great one for that Outlaw Biker vibe. 

The story is gripping, voice acting on point. Upgrading/customising the bike gives a great sense of progress. More to the point, the bike *feels* like riding a motorcycle.  Nearly every other motorcycle game feature crotch rockets. I want that lean-back LaZBoy feet up deep throttle rumble.

There isn't much for group riding like GTA's games. And I friggin' HATE zombies. I wouldn't normally *play* a game that had zombies as such a major component of the story, let alone the game. 

But Days Gone *felt* like being a lone biker making his way in a hostile -- and still beautiful -- environment, struggling between hope and cynicism, giving up on his humanity or doing the right thing. Imperfect, kind of a dick, but not, you know, a terrible person deep down.

I usually only play a game for an hour, put a review out so everyone can see the first thoughts/opinions from the get go, but good lord I couldn't put this game down. I had to be pulled away. This is the zombie game we didn't know we needed. It has a slight Last of Us feel to it, but open world. It is amazing, I spent three hours just roaming around doing optional objectives because they were so intriguing.

Edit:

After finishing the game, I can say hands down that this is a serious, hidden gem. It has a heavy hitting, sad, loving, pain inducing story line that keeps you wanting more and more. Top 3 of my personal favorite games of all time, and even after completing the game I have actually continued on to 100% it, and then actually play through New Game+.

The developers also added story lines that continue even after the main story ends. Hands down, a phenomenal game. A must have.

Edit 2: 

I've decided to finish up my platinum trophy for this game, which requires me to beat the game on the hardest difficulty (and to play new game+) and I have some things I'd like to add. This game suffers a lot from really bad transitions. 

Cut scenes don't last very long in one spot. It'll fade to black and skip ahead a little bit which feels like they didn't know how to transition it. For example, in The Last of Us, a cut scene would lead you directly into the next part, no skipping, its cinematic. This game does the opposite. You'll be in a flashback and then 6 things will happen in a matter of 30 seconds with how much it skips around.

Another issue with the game is the dated missions. A lot of chase missions which would be fine if this game was a PS3 game, it's not a deal breaker but you can definitely tell that this game isn't going to hold up very well in the long run.",1663814475,1707170011,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

           The story starts out a little bit of a drag, but it's definitely worth sticking around to unlock better gear and the game opens up a whole lot more.

           The best part of this game definitely comes out from the side quests. Burning down hordes and picking off camps of bandits is really fun to do. 

           There's a lot of fun to be had with the weapons and traps you unlock. This all pays off a lot more when you reach the later stages of the game. There's no better feeling than going from sticks and rocks to weapons of pure destruction. Finally getting to take on massive hordes of enemies you spent the early half of the game running from. 

            This is also definitely a game to start off playing on medium to harder difficulties, when its too easy it really takes away a lot from the games ability to make you really question whether or not your prepared to take a long trip or take on this camp you're going to attack. Being stuck out without fuel after an ambush really makes you feel like your fighting just to survive, and i think games that do that are often way more fun than a game that instantly gratifies you with all the weapons and ammo you need.

This game is absolutely worth your time. Even if it's not on sale. It's a great game!

It's well made and the story is interesting with some surprises along the way. I also quite like the characters. The game is good-looking and most of the game mechanics are surprisingly fun although they do tend to repeat themselves.
But I don't really mind that. The activities themselves are well designed, and repeating them is no problem. Actually I would be sad if they weren't repeated as there are many, many ways to approach each of them. So the game basically gives you that opportunity for experimentation.

The voice acting is a bit wonky, especially for the main character of Deacon. He will often speak very loudly in a context where it doesn't fit very well. He also seems overly agitated and yabbers on about nothing when you basically just want him to shut up. I mean, he'll be happily yelling on the radio during a stealth segment with enemies 2 meters away. Luckily they don't hear it, but it makes for some odd situations that breaks the immersion a bit.

I feel like Deacon's voice acting is good. It just seems like he wasn't given proper direction when recording the lines.

The progression system is pretty nice. Also like upgrading my bike. The world is decently intriguing to roam around in and, as mentioned, the story makes me want to keep playing.

There's a great sense of progression to the gameplay as well. As you get better weapons and grow stronger physically you'll be able to take on more threatening enemies. And more of them at a time.
This plays well into the progression where you will sort of start out by being scared of even a single zombie. And as you get further along single zombies and even bigger groups becomes more of a puzzle in the sense that you can take them out, you just need to use the right tools for it. That's really cool!

Story, graphic, music and sound effect are all great. Played on hard level - starting with a low bike, barely any ammo, looking for supplies everywhere, stealth everywhere to avoid any group of zombies....... It is a satisfaction when you see your bike improves, using zombies to fight against other enemy, gain more weapons and start becoming capable to face a group of zombie is where the experience becomes more dynamic. 
Even though, you will still feel the challenge, epicness, adrenaline rush, and the satisfaction when defeating a horde after planning routes and placing traps or interact with environment.

Though, you cannot really climb on to terrain objects freely, sometimes the camera angle affects interaction (when pressing E) is a bit annoying, but such disadvantage didn't affect my overall experience at all.

Days Gone is an open-world game that - depending on the percentage of completion, collectibles, and side activities - has a playtime of 40-70 hours. New Game+ adds another playthrough of playtime. In addition to the extensive story mode, the challenges game mode offers extra content.

[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 15/20[/b]

Gameplay-wise, at first glance, Days Gone is yet another survival open-world game set in its vast and repetitive open world. However, its uniqueness lies in a few key areas. Besides the usual shenanigans of these games, including a crafting system and other mandatory elements, the motorbike rides are probably the most underrated piece of its gameplay. As for the traversal, I'm happy to say that it doesn't take days to get anywhere and riding that motorbike is delightful. Fast traveling is a thing, and it consumes about the same amount of gas as if you were riding it yourself.

The gameplay in the open world revolves around maintaining the bike and filling the gas tank, as it's the sole thing that can save your life. Thankfully, it's possible to refuel in various locations, including camps and gas stations. So, gas isn't as scarce as you might think at first. There are tons and tons of police cars around the world that contain ammo in their trunks, so the ammo isn't as scarce. However, all this changes with higher difficulty levels. One thing that doesn't make much sense is that a remote forest in the middle of nowhere got so much police attention after the outbreak. I know it's a mechanic to help the player find ammo, but were these many police cars necessary? Other than that, I don't have complaints about resource looting.

As for the rest of the gameplay, there are these infestation areas and nests you must burn, enemy camps you must clear, Nero upgrade stations to visit, hordes to take out, etc. There are also friendly camps where you can upgrade your bike and weapons, purchase ammo, etc. The random activities that regularly pop up are mostly repetitive side hustles that I ignored completely for the most part. The whole gameplay loop is quite repetitive, as you'd expect, and there isn't anything special about any activities you do outside the main missions. The most enjoyable thing for me in Days Gone is shooting. Every single weapon in the game is satisfying to shoot. Hitting a headshot at a range with a rifle feels special, and shooting a few enemies in cowboy style using focus mode in close combat is as much fun. It's just pure sex if you ask me. The gameplay portion does require some getting used to. The main character also feels too heavy to control sometimes.

[h1][b]Presentation[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 13/20[/b]

Let me start by saying that the graphics are decent, but don't expect anything groundbreaking found in other PlayStation exclusives. There are plenty of locations that you must stop by and appreciate. I like it when a game offers carefully designed environments, and Days Gone excels at it in some ways and fails in others, making it a mixed bag. As for the sound quality, the soundtrack pieces are memorable, and the overall sound effect quality is also nicely done. The ambient sounds make you feel like you're there in person. The only thing that could've been better is the sound of zombies. At times, they sound like someone put a sock inside their mouths.

The animation work is another segment worth discussing, as it lacks quality. The overall movement feels satisfying, the cutscenes are of acceptable quality, and the bike you get to ride feels nice, but that's pretty much it. Character animations are static, and none have their ""own"" unique kind of movement, which is expected for this type of game and considering the publisher in question. The less significant nameless characters are almost identical to one another. Some games have specific animations for certain characters, making you believe they're real people. Days Gone feels like a AA (double-A) game aiming for AAA (triple-A) greatness. The rest of the animation work is acceptable, except the horde moments - which look like a swarm of ants running at you instead of zombies.

[h1][b]Story[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 14/20[/b]

The main problem with Days Gone and its storytelling is the pace and how everything starts bombastically and slows down too much for my taste. After the get to know the game part, it felt like nothing was happening for a good while. I was ready for the game to start throwing little bits and pieces of something bigger at me alongside exploration and stuff to keep me engaged, but it never happened in the way I expected. The repetitive side quests didn't help either, and I won't even begin to mention the average job the game does of introducing certain characters. There's a considerable lack of detail outside the most important stuff. The first few hours revolve around a great introduction and story missions that add depth and interest.

However, everything that follows feels more like a filler than a proper story unfolding. The constant tease of something bigger takes away from the overall experience and constant traversal from point A to B - ""just"" to unlock a new mission that is very much the same and as empty as the previous one, only in a different location. Sadly, I found most of what the game offers besides the main story missions boring, as there was nothing of value added to the overall experience. Yes, the game throws some intriguing side quests here and there that keep you curious, and the world exploration is inviting, but after a certain point, it gets too much to handle. After a while, and once quite a few of these side missions left me empty-handed, I stopped expecting anything special to happen.

It might be me not liking the slow and methodical approach or expecting too much too soon. But then again, I enjoyed other slow games. Its slowness didn't leave a good first impression on me, but I'm also not asking to see the ending. At least give me a reason to continue. About two-thirds (hours later) into the game, something big happens, and I was back aboard the hype train I jumped off after the introduction. The story eventually gets to the point where it should've started after the introduction. The only sad thing is that it might be too late for the real story to start unfolding this late for some people. In the end, if you ignore all the quirks at the start, it's worth dealing with all that lackluster pacing as it gets repaid in some sense later on. It could've been as half as long and it'd be perfect, as the stretching doesn't help it by any means.

[h1][b]Technicalities[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 18/20[/b]

If an open-world game like Days Gone uses UE4 - performance issues are a given. However, this one ran flawlessly for me, except for a few minor issues. As for the rest of this so-called PC port, the game runs perfectly and scales nicely across various hardware. There is no stutter, only the slow down at points during bike riding. It's very noticeable and feels like the game slows down to 0.5 speed. Other than this, thankfully, there are zero low points to report.

[h1][b]Final Verdict[/b][/h1]
[b]Rating: 80/100[/b]

Days Gone is yet another survival open-world video game worth playing that lacks the proper story pacing found in other AAA games of this caliber. I'd say Days Gone is like that one girl you have a crush on, and no matter how much you love and attention you give her - she won't give in until later on. As if that's something you're willing to tolerate until (and if) the hook-up eventually happens, that's up to you. I'm glad we got Days Gone on the PC - as it's a far better experience with all the unique PC features. I consider this one of the weakest and lowest points of PlayStation exclusives' storytelling. However, it's got its strong points worth playing through for.",1622051464,1706730372,True,44,2,0.666493773460388184,17,True,False,False

Days Gone is set in post-apocalyptic Oregon two years after the start of a pandemic that turned a portion of humanity into vicious zombie-like creatures. Former outlaw-turned-drifter Deacon St. John discovers his wife Sarah, having been assumed dead, may still be alive and goes on a quest to find her.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]Days Gone is a masterpiece in terms of visuals. The world looks so immersive and abandoned. Seeing mother nature grow over civilization’s structures really gives a good atmosphere this game was going for. Seeing the trees and grass sway and the snow just all looks so incredible! Also the photo mode is incredible in this game![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]The gameplay is not bad here. Although I do feel like the shooting mechanics are combat is just way too easy in my opinion. I never really had to strategize my attacks that much (besides some stealth which was fun). The focus ability is pretty cheesy. It slows down time so getting constant headshots is not a problem at all here, so I was pretty disappointed in the difficulty. The gas and ammo conservation is actually really well designed into the game. Although I never ran out of gas at all, it still gives you the worry of your fuel, which is a nice tough on the survival side of things. The ammo is also pretty scarce so melee combat plays a big whole in this game, and I must say that the melee combat (although basic) is really fun and smooth (especially the animations). The Bike is really fun to drive in this game and has plenty of customization to make your bike look unique and just awesome! Also the hordes are absolutely insane and terrifying to fight against, and I must say they did a fantastic job with them![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]Now this is where my review gets controversial. The Story in Days Gone is really bad. I have never been so bored in a single player story in a very long time. I’m 40 hours in and I’m still not close to the ending here. This is actually my first review out of 70, where I just got burnt out from the game. The story drags way too long, so many plot points that make zero sense, characters are uninteresting and unlikable, the plot is a burden, and the multiple “story” quests are mostly just errand missions that play the same way for the most part. The story here is a complete joke, and an insult to storytelling. I will go as far and say that the story overshadows the great gameplay this game delivers. I couldn’t find any parts of the story that got me excited to know the end result of the mission. It’s all the same and drags on forever! Maybe It’s just not for me. I hear it’s a fantastic story so maybe I’m just blinded by its greatness, who knows. You may enjoy it, but I didn’t.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]The playtime is pretty long. I’m 40+ hours and haven’t even beat the story yet. You have the a horde mode which is fun and intense. You also have a new game+ so you can carry on your character and play the game again. So there is plenty of playtime here for the price.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sounds design is really impressive. The voice acting is really good and the guns and the bike sound incredible. The zombies (or Freaks) sound scary especially when they are in a horde. The sound design is really well done here.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]The only bug I have seen was that the game stutters when you are riding the bike, besides that I have had no issues. The bike glitch can be pretty annoying, but it could just be on my end.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The performance is actually impressive here. I was able to play on max settings and get 60fps with no frame drops. With my pc specs I was really shocked especially with the graphics this game has.[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]This game had some great mechanics that I actually enjoyed. But the story and how repetitive and boring it felt was frustrating. The pacing was horrible in this game in my opinion and the first game out of my 70 reviews, where I just couldn’t beat this game before reviewing it. The combat was too easy, the story was boring with horrible pacing. I don’t mind a long story, as long as the pacing is good and the characters are actually interesting. The only saving grace was the game mechanics and hordes. Honestly I would skip this game and play something else. You are not missing a special gem here. But if you do want to try it, don’t expect a top tier and unique story that a lot of people are preaching, because I didn’t see it.[/td]

Today i will review the game Days Gone. Days gone is a post-apocalyptic game based after a zombie/virus infection ruins the world. It is quite open world and there are many things to do around the beautiful world. The mountains and areas your character play in is very pretty. There is also great storyline that takes place around the world. There are also multiple storylines to play, which includes side missions. There is also a motorcycle the main character can equip different parts on to customize their motorcycle. At first, where you can explore will be a small area due to not having enough gas for the bike, but once a player upgrades their bike, the world becomes much bigger to explore. For those who like a difficult curve, there is also more difficult modes in the game, including Challenge Mode. Challenge mode lets you do set missions to get patches for main game playing to help you in the main storyline. Anyways, here are my PROS and CONS list:


PROS:

- A beautiful massive open ended world to explore.
- Ability to earn levels and open skills.
- Ability for player to customize their bike to different specs.
- Mutliple storylines and many side quests.
- Challenge mode and more difficult levels in case the game seems too easy.
- Post game quests to explore more of the world.
- Works with controllers. I am using a ZEN black switch controller.
- It works on windows 11 OS.

CONS:

- Some pop in graphic issues when loading areas happen.
- Some minor bugs found in the game, such as sometimes when killing monsters, they float in the air, or look like they are standing up.
- A serious bug happened to me. Basically, it did not load the ground geometry correctly. I did fix it by putting my graphic settings to low, shut down the game, restarted it, and played thru the section and it fixed it. You can find the bug here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1259420/discussions/0/3053986162866724340/

Recommended game. The game actually reminds me alot of the MAD MAX game. Although the settings are different in both games, they both have that feel that is similiar in each game. If you personally like post apocalytipc open world games where you can explore while riding a bike around, this is your game. If the price is too high, consider buying it on sale.

[hr][/hr]

The game is a great length, I have 100% for all stories/sides and around 75% of the collectables (some don’t show on the map so I cba finding them), and that took around 40 hours. It doesn’t feel too short but manages to not overstay its welcome.

Admittedly it takes a while to get going, with the first few hours being fairly slow paced but it soon picks up and maintains a solid stride until the end.

Characters and voice acting are generally great, Rikki, Boozer and The Colonel stand out, but the quality is strong across the board. Every character serves a purpose - they are well written and have believable motivations.

The world is beautiful, it's no RDR2/Cyberpunk, but visually the game looks great. Lighting can be a little buggy sometimes, particularly in caves but this is a minor issue.

The port is one of the best from the PS collection, minus the occasional gamespeed issue (one section near the end of the game caused time itself to slow down if I angled the camera a certain way). Around 90FPS on a 3060Ti, maxed out at 1440p with no noticeable dips.

Killing the hordes is crazy fun, and I’m amazed at the technology behind it. It’s Hitman levels of crowd density, it looks and plays fantastic. 

And now the bad...

Deacon aims like a moron. Seriously. This is a third person shooter where the main character naturally has zero idea how to accurately fire a gun. HE WAS IN THE ARMY!!! This isn’t really an issue against freakers, but against human enemies it’s actually very frustrating. There are some perks you can unlocks as you progress through the game that slightly improve this but it’s still not good enough. Gunplay in general annoys me, not because it’s bad (as much as I’m complaining it’s actually fine), but because I really wish they went in a different direction with it. I spent half the game really wishing it had more of an Uncharted shooting style. There is no hipfire, and when you’re being chased halfway across Oregon by 300 freakers, you really want to be able to keep some movement speed up whilst shooting. Instead you have to awkwardly stop, turn, aim and then shoot. It really feels like a missed opportunity here.

The game can sometimes feel like it’s actively trying to wind you up. You go from a cutscene, into a 20 second long forced slow walk scene, then straight into another cutscene multiple times in this game. I have no idea why they did this. It’s also pretty buggy, enemies often clip through the ground, physics go wrong all the time and freaker AI can often be stumped by knee high walls. Pathing for all characters in the game is pretty bad, friendlies can easily be blocked by Deacon, and they make no effort to go around if this is the case. Deacon himself often walks in circles when trying to interact with people or pick up collectables, as the game does a terrible job at trying to get him in the correct position for the interaction. 

There is also a distinct lack of variety in both mission design, and map design. Story missions suffer less from this, but if you’re 100%ing like I did, some of the side missions can feel very repetitive. Go to place, kill humans come back. It also seems to force you to repeatedly pick these missions up from the quest giver for no logical reason. Deacon has a radio, and it’s used throughout the story – characters radio Deacon, telling them to come see them, rather than simply giving the details of the quest immediately. It feels a bit like padding the runtime, and it isn’t needed. This game is good enough and it isn’t necessary.

I always rant more than I need to and make it sound worse than it is. It’s really good and it’s a clear recommend for me. I liked the story, shooting freakers is great and I always felt the need to keep coming back to it.

While writing this review I've played for 72 hours. I have not finished the game and there are still areas I have not unlocked yet. What I 'thought' would be ""the ending"" 12+ hours ago was not, the game just keeps on throwing new story, mission, maps and character development at me.

I don't know Bend Studios or Sony Entertainment but everyone involved in this game (except marketing) should be proud because Days Gone is an awesome game. Absolutely awesome and almost perfect technically executed. Hands down for all devs, they are pros.

I loved State of Decay. I loved FallOut 3 and I loved Far Cry 3. Days Gone is like they all come together in one solid package. 

As I wrote, I buy games at discount but by now I've played into what would have been the 2nd DLC in similar  games. Sorry for being such a cheep ass. Days Gone IS A STEAL AT FULL PRICE.

- the characters are not likeable, neither villains nor protagonists;
- annoying wolves and infected wolves, holy molly...;
- annoying snipers on trees with aim-bot;
- I couldn't care less about the missing wife, and the boring flashback sections;
- good rewarding system, but too slow to progress;
- unbalanced enemy mechanics, sometimes they are a hulk and other times they are as dumb as rock;
- stealth feels good, but way too repetitive and limited;
- the ""main"" story drags on and on, after a while, I forgot what exactly I was persuing;
- more often than not, the actions that some characters take are way too predictable, but it's no surprise, as the director took inspiration of many zombie series and movies, so I've seen it all;
- some stability issues, in this PC port;
- please, don't force us, the players, to slow-walk some sections, they are annoying;
- escort missions are beyond idiotic;
- the mixture of realism and arcade mechanics are not well thought-out, like Red Dead Redemption 2, to name one example;
- ambience is good and well designed;
- the soundtrack is generic and I had a better time disabling it;

The game is designed to waste as much time as it can. The difficulty will suck you dry. The A. I. of the horde of zombies are perfected to annoy you and outrun you. Fetching resources is a chore and not fun.

Endless randomly respawning TANKS of 3 TYPES. One is a type of hunter which stun locks you!!! One Hit KO Bike Traps. Random Raiders spawn who just let you shoot em.

[B][U]Control Scheme[/U][/B]The game has so many scripted points even including when certain actions do not get canceled out or do not work for no reason. You simply CANT RUN, YOU CANT DODGE, YOU CANT RELOAD; YOU CANT THIS AND THAT. YOU CANT GET ON THE BIKE SUDDENLY. I KNOW I USE TH STEAM DECK BACK BUTTONS TO MAKE IT EASIER BUT WONT WORK. It is the Fallout 4 ""die and not see the same enemy spawn (in DG it is of course TANKS), reload and have a 1 in 3 chance to get it again.

Zombie Horde goals in Endgame: You miss one Zombie - its 5 hours of trying or RELOAD. YOU CANT FIND ONE HORDE SPAWN, RELOAD.

I am so tired of this game. I want to finish it to the most but I soon wont be able to.

It starts to be more tedious than Snowrunner made by braindead RU devs.




God awful linear missions in some cases. No transitions without black screens from missions to open world and open world to missions. The game despawns every foe in the transition from open world to mission. Combat AI is good. Missions do not really use Zombie AI at all. Game is limited to the PS4 spec which forces to have areas be smaller especially towns. It is a bummer because the gun-play, exploration, stealth, skill tree, driving and more are good. The game could need a remake with proper mission transitions and more content which would need an overhaul for most stuff. 

Days Gone is a game which feels worse than 6th Gen GTA games and Clones -- Clones like Scarface are way  more advanced in theory because everything comes together and DG lacks the coherent transitions, non Rule-Breaking-AI and more freedom to do things á la Red Dead Redemption 1 or more likely Dragon Age or Bully which all work with smaller scale maps. This game is small scale in theory.

Bikes are slow - World is small - Combat's great - Story is good - Transitions and NPC interactions clunky and frequently with fade to black instead of e.g. seeing freed hostages run on foot to the next camp -- they despawn off-screen


You either HATE or LOVE the game. The game is literally the modern equivalent of a console game which would have seen more love on PC which this port actually is but only bug fixes. PS5 bwc version has so many bugs in mission scripts and the PC has these fixed.

Pros: 
1)Setting, scenery and stuff. It was really pretty. I like how most of the landscape looks and works. I like the changing seasons and variable weather.
2) I generally play a stealth character and MOST of this game lets me do this. I can kill most hordes by careful mining of an area and leading them to their doom. I love that I can sneak up and shiv a critter. Awesome. I like that I can sneak fairly near a nest and not trip the monsters.
3) The crossbow. I do 90% of my killing with this. It's AWESOME.
4) Bikes. Good plan. They go almost anywhere and you can do your own maintenance.
5) The setup makes sense. I love it when the internal logic works.

CONS
1) Data mining. I had no idea how bad it was when I set the game up. These people want ALL your data? All your passwords? Why? Parameters for a program have to be consciously decided, so it's no accident that they want to know literally EVERYTHING you do. I have a problem believing this is benign.
2) Your decisions are unimportant. No matter what you do, you will play the game they way they want. None of your decisions matter. You're a rat in a very limited maze. Believe me, if I could have popped Skizzo 5 minutes after I met him, I would have. Nope. He lives until the STORY says he dies. Want to tell Iron Mike he's a short sighted idiot? Nope, you play it out how they want you to. In this area Mass Effect is still god. The only decision you get is 'do I kill this zombie now or in five minutes'.
3) I get the concept of resource management, but dudes, you can't go a mile on a full tank of gas on a MOTORCYCLE? Seriously? Are you stupid? Do you people ride at all? You can go more than a mile on a QUART of gas, never mind filling the bike from a 5 gallon can. And the headlight? Great that you can turn it off, but it shouldn't turn itself on EVERY TIME. Yes, the light is minor, but so is a thorn in your shoe; it's tiny, but constantly annoying.
4) Ammo. I can only carry about 30 rounds for the rifle, 20 for the pistol and 8 for the crossbow. That's just stupid. Ffs, they make these cool things called POCKETS now. Flipside: you can carry 6 landmines, 6 proximity mines, 6 molotovs, 6 grenades, etc, etc, etc, which is also silly. It's... unbalanced. I can't carry stuff I use every 10 seconds, but I can carry tons of stuff I don't.
5) This is the one that destroyed it for me - THE HORDES REGENERATE. I was just at the saw mill where there is a huge horde. I had snuck in about 6 times and mined every flat surface. Now, the mines only go off if you're close enough for them to register on your radar, so I waited until the horde was home and cruised up on my bike. The mines went off. There were still several hundred zombies left. I set more mines and had them chase me through them. The mines went off and killed more. I got away on my scooter, rolled around and came back maybe 10 seconds later. THERE WERE NO CORPSES AND THE NUMBER OF ZOMBIES HAD NOT DIMINISHED. WHAT'S THE POINT IF YOU CAN'T EVEN KILL THEM? So, if the sawmill is so necessary that it has plot armor, why not put it somewhere that justifies monster immortality?
6) Quoting another reviewer; everybody's an a**hole. Everybody. I get that life's tough in the apocalypse, but damn. I don't want to do missions for any of these people. Your choices are literally work for the slaver, the militant thief, or the psychologically damaged idiot. At least with the slaver and the thief, survival is job 1, and they don't trust anyone equally. The PDI trusts both the thug whom he knows is out to destroy him, and the local insane terrorist organization. And Rikki... She supposedly rode with Deacon and Boozer in the earlier days of the disaster, but now she's surprised that you want to kill a bad guy, she's shocked that you want to be rid of the lunatics that kidnap people and torture them to death? Half the time she acts like she wants to play games with her girlfriend and make her jealous by how she treats you. Rikki's a hose-bag-moo-cow who needs a brains transplant from someone with sense. AND YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE.
6) The wolves. yeah, they're not hard to kill, but they're going to hit you no matter what you do. If you're already swinging the machete at their furry faces and they decide to jump, they hit, you don't. 
7) I really wish I could hit the thing I'm pointed at. 
8) How in the name of bhudda can I shoot a guy eight times in the chest and he keep coming? If he's that ripped on drugs, he shouldn't be able to fire a weapon accurately, or maybe not be able to fire one at all.

The story itself is quite good, there are some plot twist and turn there, so comparing to other zombie theme games surely it holds up or even much more better

The world simply beautiful, I loved exploring it with my motor bike while casually hit zombies along the road.

The survival and crafting system are not that hardcore but thats why I love it !! Yes there will be grinding to find parts etc for crafting but it will be plenty and not become tiresome.

If you love zombie apocalypse open world theme then surely you have to play this !!

Gunplay is complete trash. Needs to be blessed by RNG gods to hit headshots in a single player game. The slow-motion is just the epitome of lazy gameplay.
Bike controls are not good at all either. Also, the refueling is the worst gimmick I have seen in any open world game. Dunno the meaning behind riding a loud af bike in the middle of an apocalypse apart from the stupid cliche of bikers saving the world.
Saved 2 survivors and am already getting repeated dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, Deacon is insufferable. Constantly mutters to himself the most mundane stuff. Also, shouts in the middle of a bunch of zombies (no, I wont be using the term freakers) with the subtlety of a shotgun in the middle of the night if the cut-scene calls for it.

At first glance, it may seem like a beautiful and vast game, but you quickly realize how poorly it is made and how forced it is.

I literally got stuck at 3.6 hours of gameplay because it's completely impossible to move forward.
While exploring the map I had the bad luck of finding a closed building, whose entrances must be opened via a generator.
The problem with all this is that when you power the generator, 4 megaphones placed far apart from each other randomly start screaming non-stop, attracting thousands upon thousands of zombies in literally 2 seconds.
At this point, you're completely screwed... you certainly can't face them all with the few bullets you have (you find one bullet every 50 enemies or so, and by shooting you make even more noise), and face a myriad of zombies with only the melee weapon (which will be unusable within 2, maximum 3 shots) it's clearly impossible.
I can't even escape, because I left my trash motorcycle (10 liters to travel a kilometre) very very far away (like 30 meters), and of course the main character runs slower than my 90 years old grandma, and he gets tired after 15 meters.
So basically I keep dying and dying in the same spot. Why in the hell would you put a thing like that?
I don't care that I could load some old save I did in the previous hour of the game for avoiding that situation, it's just stupidly trash.

And another thing, how the f4ck do you preset a single key (the space bar) to perform 10 different actions?
This game seems like the lame version of Dying Light to me.

Days Gone is going up high on my list of favorite games. I expected very little out of the story and characters, given that this is a zombie game at the end of the day. I was wrong. Damn wrong. The story and characters have about as much depth as RDR2, and matches it graphically as well. Gameplay itself is similar to Far Cry for the most part. The world feels truly dead (in a good way) but features little patches of life in each and every camp. The music and sound effects are great. The main story and a handful of side missions lasted me 50 hours. The ending of the main story genuinely made me shed a tear, something that I've never done when playing a video game. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, stay away from any forums or videos before beating the game. I spoiled a couple plot points for myself, so don't make the same mistake.

Progression feels very satisfying. You are very weak at the start and you are afraid of hordes and getting shot. Overtime the main character psychologically advances whilst your stats and skills are getting advanced in a parallel, creating this doubly satisfactory game play loop. Aside from main char and the close friend, char progression could be done better. It feels like some of the chars' story lines got left hanging. Conclusion and path to it from the start feels satisfying enough. It could be easily followed by a sequel due to ending cliff hangers, it's got some good writing with some plot twists.

[b]Bike[/b] is  perhaps the best thing in the game. It feels realistic and fun to drive around and you get a deep customization system for it ranging from noise suppression to avoiding water damage and storing more ammunition.

My personal favorite thing about the game is the [b]random events[/b]. You can witness a great deal of random mayhem while driving around. In one occasion I lured a Breaker into a camp but I didn't know there was a Screamer zombie awaiting us. She screamed and called in a small horde then a black bear and a wolf pack joined the fight. All of these encounters being non scripted and organic is the peak point of this game along with displaying massive hordes with good collision.

Human enemy [b]AI[/b] is average at best but it doesn't apply to Freakers ( zombies you might call ). These guys can flank you, avoid molotov fire and cut path to reach you while being able to dodge bullets. It's fun to deal with giant horde of zombies coming at you while you try to set traps and mow down with your hit and run guerilla tactics.

[b]Gun play[/b] is good. Weapon sounds are loud and impactful. There are a ton of weapons and you need to grind to get them by completing story lines or building camp trusts. 

Watching sunset in a deserted area while hearing wolves howling birds chirping checking your surroundings for a potential stalker is a great feeling that this game achieves giving to you. If you like some open world story driven tense adventure game with slow burning fuel, this game is for you.

[h2] Make the game even better for yourself [/h2]
[b] The game has a great set of mods available. 
Do you find the game too easy? Install some mods ranging from increased freaker counts to decreased ammo to massive hordes. 
Do you want the game to look better? Install those amazing reshade mods that make the game look stunning. 
Do you want to make Deacon look like a special forces unit? They got that too along with a ton of weapon skin mods and various changes.
Just google it and you'll find what you want.

Also there were still bugs or game design things that didnt make sense. It was way too easy to kill some bandit camps by making some nice and attracting the zombies. Best part was doing a sidequest-chase, which didnt really feel amazing either, and catching the guy only to trigger a scene in the middle of a horde and immediately dying afterwards.

Days Gone is an open-world post-apocalyptic zombie game with survival elements. It's a LONG game. At the time of this review, the 68.7 hours I have in the game is a single playthrough doing only the main story with a fair number of extras.

You'll take the role of Deacon St. John, an abrasive character for sure. The game throws you not only into an active virus outbreak that leads to a zombie apocalypse, but into Deacon's relationships with a number of people. People he seems to not have the greatest history with — “burned bridges”. He's also stuck on his lost love, two sentiments I identify with more than I care to admit in my real life. Ultimately, this makes him slightly unlikable. That combined with the game's length makes this a game for people looking for a certain experience.

[h3]My bike, my bike, my kingdom for my bike![/h3]
Being reductive, this game feels a lot like Death Stranding meets Far Cry. But I don't think it would be inappropriate to draw comparisons to Red Dead Redemption 2. 

Your bike is your lifeline. It's how you travel, it's how you save. It will literally save your life. Fast travel is allowed if you have the gas and the path is not obstructed by things like infestation zones. Otherwise you need to get around without it. The bike does need gas to function but this is relatively trivial as an aspect of the game's survival traits. For one, gas cans respawn and do not run out of gas. And gas pumps are still active in this time, it's only been a few years. When I first started playing, I became rather anxious thinking I'd need to be constantly concerned about gas. You're always getting something as well. Killing stray zombies (freaks) or marauders will earn you XP to upgrade Deacon's abilities. The freak ears and other zombie types can also be sold to camps for credits and that will also build trust. 

You do need to be careful however, ambushes can happen out of the blue. Not only this, but the gunfire or explosions can cause more freaks or non-infected wildlife to show up. Wolves, bears, mountain lions. The game can go from 0 to 100 real fast.

Your bike can be upgraded upon building trust with camps. As a drifter, you're able to go out on missions for a number of camps and establish more trust within them. You'll earn both trust (a type of XP really) and camp credits to refill things like ammo. Other resources can be pilfered out in the wild. You'll learn where to find certain types of resources as well — scrap can be found in almost any vehicle if the hood is still shut, gas cans are usually found around industrial vehicles such as tow trucks. Ammo can usually be found in police vehicles, medkits in ambulances — things you'd expect. 

Much like Death Stranding, while you aren't a “Porter”, you are effectively playing that same role within this world. You'll learn the map and better ways to navigate it to perform the tasks the camps want. Bounty hunting, horde killing, resource retrieval and more.

There's also a bit of conspiracy if you investigate the NERO checkpoints and go down that path. 

[h3]The Gist[/h3]
I think this game appeals to a rather specific audience. It does have multiple endings and there's a TON to do in this game. Granted, it can be a tad grindy. But the gunplay is great, the bike riding is great and I personally identified with Deacon in a number of ways. More prudently, if you feel... lost in your real life, this game might be the exact thing you need to distract yourself for a time.

Everything feels outdated, from the story to the gameplay. Playing it is like slogging through an endless bore, way longer than it should be. I started annoyed, ended up bored, and wondered why I bothered.

The whole game is basic, boring, and feels like stuff we've seen for the past ten years. Nothing's new or interesting. The story is like a cheap zombie movie, super predictable, with characters that are more like cardboard cutouts than real people. The cutscenes are like a bad PowerPoint with constant fading in and out, making it hard to get into the game.

They hyped up the open-world thing, but it's a letdown. Just a big, empty space with the same tasks over and over. Clearing zombie nests or fetching supplies gets old fast. The missions feel like a never-ending cycle of boring. And the motorcycle rides? Seriously, what's the point of an open-world game when all you do is ride a noisy, clunky bike that handles like a messed-up shopping cart? Riding through the same dull landscapes gets real boring.

Now, the AI – it's a joke. Humans and animals act like they're in a comedy show. Human AI is so dumb, it's hard to believe. And animals? Wolves, deer, bears – that's it. Hunting them down feels more like a chore than survival.

And why does everyone in this game ride a big, loud, gas-guzzling bike in a world that's gone to hell? Like, is everyone suddenly a biker? No one uses a four-wheel vehicle in this game. Maybe bikes are easier to repair, but they also use a ton of gas and make a ton of noise. Why not choose other bikes like electric or dirt bikes? It just doesn't make sense.

I write this review after completing the story in 65 hours (took my time) but i still have some hordes and probably a last mission. Why i'm writing this before completely finishing everything? Just a little patience and you'll find out.

In my books this game is a 7/10, maybe 7.5. So you get an idea of my ranking God of War, Witcher 3 are a 10, Horizon zero dawn is a 8.5. 

I really loved this game. The idea is awesome, the story is captivating even though sometimes slow still loved it. I took my time and explored everything and enjoyed it very much. 

So why 7/10? Don't get me wrong this game could have been easily a masterpiece but i think someone at sony or whoever was in charge just pulled the plug at some points. They decided enough is enough. This reminds me of Cyberpunk at launch ... great but full of bugs and clearly unfinished. Sadly Days Gone is the same. What bugs you may ask ... Well deers flying, bike flying, bike stuck, crows stuck in the air, everyone flying, zombies running suddenly jump in the sky, getting stuck in nothing (literally i was walking and got stuck), getting stuck in a tree, falling off the map, crashes over crashes and so many more.

Then there are the little things that are not bugs but clearly give a vibe of bad planning like you could put a truck between two rock but you can't pass between them, you can press ""E"" to talk with someone and you spin around over and over and over and over again like 20 times before finally talking. Pressing E to get on bike fast but game doesn't let me. Climbing is allowed only on certain things even though in the situation you can climb on and in 65 hours there were so many moments i was like ""wtf dude seriously"" ... Clearly the game is very rough around the edges. Many tweaks should have been integrated but sadly that wasn’t what happened.

Then there's the difficulty which is too easy. I played directly at HARD2 and it's just a normal in comparasion with other games. I think it needed a tweak or new diff like nightmare or something.

Then there's the side quests or camp mission which are the same mission over and over again. This makes the difference between a masterpiece and just a good game. There are some quests when Deacon saves someone and they have a little chat and tease like they know eachother but you never met that person and you will never meet him/her again. I mean what a waste when you could implement the camp quests to be like bonding with the people in the camp but no. I think one of the only ones that mattered was when Manny from copeland was kidnapped but it was not enough. What a wasted opportunity. Just go and kill some people with no context and nothing to add to the story.

Then there's the walking during a quest when you have to walk at snail pace. We all hate that but happily that doesn't happen too often.

Then there's the fact that you can lose content without warning. The devs decided that doing a useless camp quest is more important than some side quests (marked with white) that actually give you an useful insight into Deacon. WTAF! What i mean by that is camp quests stay on the map and you can do them but white ones that usually are really important to the character dissapear. Pay attention at the quests! if you see a white one go do it because if you do something else that white quest can dissapear.

If you take your time exploring and you played a couple of games you’ll get a feeling that the game is not finished and i don’t believe for a second that a team that wrote the main story so well, that implemented a zombie survival game so well would, by choice, leave the game as it is. Many substories are left untold and those that are told feel like there was many more to be said. I don’t know how to explain it but this is the feeling that i got.

Even with all of this i loved the game!!

Oh, i almost forgot, why i’m writing this before finishing everything? BECAUSE IT CRASHED WHEN I WAS FIGHTING A HORDE ... AGAIN!!!

In the game you can mod your bike-both visual and performance, guns have only one possible ""mod"" and that is a ""homemade"" silencer-from car filter, that means it have durability that depletes with each shot, which sometimes cause trouble when you want stealth approach. Melee weapons have great animations-finishers but I wish there could be better combos and/or more meele weapons.  Survival is important part of the game-you have to refill gas/repair your bike, check dead bodies for stuff you can use etc.
Game is prety dynamic-durring rides you sometimes get ambushed by enemy, sometimes you find survivor that need rescue and also changing weather that have impact on the gameplay. Altougth there should be more music in the game-sound of engine after few hours became annoying/booring(atleast for me)-parts where music was were realy great-I remember atleast 3.

Challenges are trully challenging, sometimes too much and sometime one wrong movement cost you losing challenge with good start. 
NG+ in survival 2 (hardest diff.) is little disapointing-I expected some hardcore survivalist for example less ressources found in game, quicker fuel consuption or more enemies but no. Suvival 2 is more like Annoying 2 cause only thing changed from hard (atleast I noticed) is hidden HUD-which temporarily pop up when you activate survival vission-that means basically traveling without minimap and thats just anoying.

Having played Days Gone to its completion, Days Gone shines the most in the early game where implementation of resource scarcity really makes you struggle to survive, but falls off when you realize it doesn’t have a lot of variety to offer, from its modes of gameplay to its variety of enemies, just repetition upon repetition upon repetition until you get sick of it by the end and finish it out of sunk cost obligation.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Gameplay in Days Gone mostly involves clearing an area of people, clearing an area of the infected, and a [b]LOT[/b] of long tedious motorcycle rides (for survival difficulty).  Having completed the game in survival mode, I do not recommend other play it for their first or subsequent playthrough beause the game isn't well designed to be played without the minimap/compass UI.

[h2]Enemy Variety[/h2]
I like the basic Swarmer infected, which are comparable to Lycans From Resident Evil 8, but do not like that Bleachers are basically Swarmers with more HP, or that Reachers are basically Swarmers with more HP and occasional zoomies, then there are Screamers which basically just summon 5 Swarmers. Days gone really struggles in its enemy variety; you don't really have unique strategies for unique infected variants, because they mostly act like tankier versions of the basic ones, you 1) dodge roll attacks and 2) shoot them in the head. 

The more-HP-and-damage ethos doesn’t just end with Swarmers, because infected wolves and bears are simply regular wolves and bears with more-HP-and-damage, with the same shitty wolf/bear startup attack animations that is more-or-less unreadable.

Human ""marauders"" factions are basically the same but in 3 different flavors,  sometimes with armor and helmets in the late game. Clearing with ""marauder camps"" is very comparable to clearing camps in Far Cry 3, or Tomb Raider, where stealth kills is an option or go in guns blazing.

[h2]Gameplay modes[/h2]
Stealth in this game is also comparable to Far Cry 3, but implemented poorly due to how fuzzy viewcones width and length are, the short duration from being noticed to a game over screen when detected in stealth sections.

Footprint tracking was a dull gameplay element in Witcher 3, it is also a dull element here, and arguably repeated way too much. Someone also forgot to change the color of footprints from white when you’re tracking on white surfaces like snow or brightly lit dirt paths.

There is a lot of motorcycle riding in Survival difficulty, which isn't great to control with mouse and keyboard (or controller, I suspect), and jumping off ramps isn't fun (no mid-air maneuvarablility, no backflips, and damage upon landing). There's no speed gauge UI to actually show speed gain from activating the nitro, and bike chase combat is basically just waiting for crosshairs to shrink.

Clearing Hordes are initially exhilarating but becomes a testament that even the best part of the game, will become tired and forgettable if you have to repeat them dozens of time with little variation.

Weapon balance is mostly skewed towards Assault rifles, SMGs, and machine guns which has high fire rate and ammo capacity, with sniper rifles having niche uses for distant humans and high HP infecteds, and the pistols, shotguns, and bowgun being next to useless in comparison.

Crafting is pretty barebones, and hardly becomes interesting with occasions where have to make a choice on two different tools you want sharing the same limited ingredients.

[h1]UI problems & general lack of polish[/h1]

The trigger zone for interactibles such as bike repairs, bike fueling and NPC interactions being finicky and annoying 

The game menu is a nightmare, good luck inspecting the collectible file you just found in there. 

The equipment wheel is another set of nightmare from the accursed realm that is console gaming, 

Also due to being a console game, some actions are bound to the same button such as reloading and switching with ground weapons, the 4 throwable explosives you have need to be shuffled with one key, then the same for 4 distractor items, and 3 land mine items.

The minimap is too zoomed in and doesn't show how far [?] events are from the player, the main map doesn't show anything that is shown in the minimap. The minimap also fails to show things you might be searching for such as generators, fuel cans, or those f@cking 7 polystyrene cups, along with the next tracking point-of-interest sometimes.

enemies sometimes freeze in space, swarmers sometimes have pathing errors and get stuck on walls or other geometries

Conversations sometimes overlaps and gets jumbled up between: Radio conversations, Radio Free Oregon, background characters talking, walk/ride n’ talk sections, NERO recorders, etc.

Conversations can be missed because they are cut short by area triggers. Sometimes the area trigger is placed a few meters of you, which means you get about 5 seconds of conversation before it is cut off.

Unintentional triggers for moving down ladders, moving under low gaps, moving across narrow gaps

No animation-cancelling for animal skinning or bunker hatch opening 

On one occasion, I attempted to escape a horde in a cave after the NPC on radio warned me that a horde was coming my way and told me to get out, the game pulled the “leaving mission zone” crap on me and forced me to kill the horde.

On another occasion I cleared a cave of human anarchists for the “just doing my job” mission, after which the game spawned an entire horde out of thin air right in front of me as soon as the mission was over.

Neither the map nor minimap showing the tunnels when you’re within cave systems.

Having to wait a couple of minutes out on the road before having to go back to the same quest-giver, rather than the quest-giver giving your next mission while you are right in front of him

 [h1]Story & characters[/h1]
Days Gone has a linear story structure where you can’t role-play or make meaningful choices impacting relationships or the fate of settlements. I’m generally fine with this in the same way I’m fine with Far Cry 3 and Resident Evils’ railroad linearity, but you should be aware that this isn’t your Fallout 1&2 type RPG where you travel to different towns and influence their fates and get to make decisions.

The story/writing & characters of Days gone is generally adequate… in the early sections, but kinda falters in the last act where certain pivotal events are really dry and underwhelming, and in the very last section pulls some tropes which degraded the story telling for me.

There also an underlying elements fo hypocrisy and lack of self-awareness for Deacon and the settlements when they are thieves (ScAvEnGiNg), mass murder camps that they come into conflict with (via You),  Spies (Deacon in last act), and oppressors to some degree, being work/slave camps leveraging safety and food; which is understandable if food and human labor is scarce in the post-apocalypse, but you do also keep finding plenty of mushrooms, berries, herbs, and deers as you ride around, along with wolves and bears that commit suicide by charging at you to their demise.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Overall, Days gone feels like a amalgamated reconstitution of systems from other games to make something painfully generic and unoriginal, from open world maps filled with enemy camps to clear, a half-baked crafting system, stat upgrades & skill point allocations, terrible stealth sections, repetitive footprint tracking sections, underdeveloped animal hunting, and the occasional uninspired bike chase sections. Where it takes from other games, Days Gone often does not improve upon them, and often makes it worse than its contemporaries

However after 3 hours, I refunded it again, since it came with a variety of issues... And no, I'm not talking about performance, which btw I can't address it since I have a RTX 4070...

1. BUGGY TELEPORTING ENEMIES

NPCs are BUGGY! During the 3 hours I played, I experienced zombies and enemy humans teleporting randomly, as if they ""had to reset themselves"". One moment you are carefully watching a enemy sneaking around a truck, ready to attack him when he gets around the corner, and POOF he is gone... :/ Same goes for zombies btw, which also teleport completely away, or stutter about the place...

I don't think I have to explain why teleporting zombies, is a BIG mood kill in a zombie survival game...

2. WEIRD STORY PACING

This one really got to me... And honestly, I'm one of the last people to complain about story in a game... :/ During the intro, you[spoiler] save a radio tower [/spoiler], and after the mission you call various NPCs over your radio on your bike... And HELL breaks loose... ':D 

Imagine 6 random conversions, QUICK FIRING after each other so fast, that you have NO clue which conversation is relevant to which... I was left COMPLETELY lost, to what to do next... I had been given 6 different stories and objectives, and had no idea which mission progressed which story...

Clearly the pacing of the missions have not been taken into consideration... At that isn't all! D: RANDOM cutscenes will SLAP you in the face, in WEIRD inconvenient moments, that feels completely unnatural... As well as almost as if there is a 10sec time skip, between gameplay and cutscene...

The game... is WIERDLY build up in how story is delivered, in what I can best describe as ""non AAA quality""... As if a small indie studio with inexperienced people, made the story flow design.

3. ENEMY AI

I don't know about everyone else... But when I saw trailers and gameplay of this game, I imagined this ""flowy"" enemy AI design, where a horde chased after you, made to feel alive and full of ragdol type characters... 

That is NOT how it feels, when you actually play the game.

Enemies, whether human or zombies, have the same 2-3 animations when they run at you... :/ Which SLAPS you in the face with a ""you are playing a video game"" feeling... Again, just like with teleporting zombies, it breaks immersion A LOT.

4. CONCLUSION

I was looking forward to this game, but it wasn't at all what I had expected... :/ It is NOT a polished experience, and it does NOT feel ""alive"" like something like The Last of Us does, when it comes to the games story and flow...

It’s strange Days Gone was kind of dismissed when it originally launched on PS4 in 2019. Maybe audiences were suffering from zombie-apocalypse fatigue.

I hope the overall sales figures are enough, because I really want to see a squeal to this.

There’s a substantial story here and a large map that opens up in parts. The game-play and difficulty is well balanced and the world is full of missions and stuff to find. There and chill moments, intense and terrifying moments, and emotional moments. It promises about 60 hours of game-play to finish all the story-lines. 

Maybe it’s the PC port, but at times the game can get a little buggy and twitchy, i.e. some dialogue ques and prompts are off or repetitive. Nothing game breaking though and rarely even ruins immersion.

Most of the main and side characters are funny and interesting with unique personalities and traits. Graphics are great and it runs well. The massive zombie hordes are an actual threat and can end you quickly if you aren't prepared.  While there are the typical open world copy/paste side activities like clearing bandit camps, zombie nests and collecting NERO injectors, I find them all fun even if they are often seen as repetitive and annoying. They really nail the bike mechanics and overall feel. Constantly having your bike with you makes it become a part of the player, and although not as in depth, reminds me of Horses from Red Dead Redemption 2 except you don't constantly talk to your bike and pat it on the head. 

This is one of the first games besides The Last of Us that really does the post apocalyptic atmosphere right. There are corpses, zombies attacking AI survivors/wildlife and traffic jams all over. Accidents and hazardous conditions like flooded roads, roads destroyed by mudslides, roads blocked by trees or vehicles plus many other set pieces can be seen throughout the massive open world map. Combined with the soundtrack it gives you a creepy and unsettling feeling. I've gotten side tracked time after time to look at many different aspects of the environment. Bend did a really good job at creating an immersive world. There is a photo mode as well, which only makes the number of times I get sidetracked worse for me.

My only gripe? The stupid, and very unnecessary data collection policy. Sony this is a single player story game, there is literally nothing you need to collect data wise. I don't care if its ""anonymous"", its a problem and needs to stop. I'm not going to trust a corporation when they tell me my data is ""anonymous"". While I would really suggest that the data collection is removed from the game, I am well aware Sony wont do it. 

Overall besides the data collection bullshit, Bend Studios did a fantastic job here, and this makes me really happy to see what other PS-exclusive titles will be making their way to Steam. 8.5/10.",1621579811,1705642914,True,27,1,0.610852479934692383,0,True,False,False

In summary ? It may be the best Far Cry/Ubisoft ""go everywhere and do/collect stuff"" game out there. Easily surpassing comparable games. The story, albeit formulaic, is pretty interesting too. It's thanks to the storytelling and the narrative design as well, which managed to immerse me without making me feel like completing secondary missions like I would do my chores. The clear 3 Act structure also kind of feels like playing a trilogy/duology in a single game, thanks to the separate storylines. Although the game clearly was thought as the start of a saga, it feels pretty complete and don't really makes you mad about the cancellation of the sequel.

On the other hand, gameplay is a mixed bag. There are a lot of nice ideas that just feel wasted. Zombies (""Freakers"") are a joke at best and infuriating at worst: Hordes are fun at first, until you realize that running and gunning while throwing the occasional is preferable to setting up traps and using your environment. In the same way, difficulty settings feel tacked on and worsening the experience instead of enhancing it: ""Survival"" in particular removes general Quality of Life features such as Fast Travel or the HUD without giving clear alternatives, like visual cues for life outside of the screen flashing red when near death... All the while not removing any of the cheesy running & gunning strategy.

The worst offender there are probably the challenge mode, which has the potential to make you actively hate the game if you try to 100% achievement complete it. They are clearly a poorly planned afterthought tacked on a game that was definitely not designed for that kind of gameplay (especially not on the Steam Deck, on which they constantly crash).

All in all, Days Gone is an imperfect but still greatly enjoyable experience, with an interesting story and setting and gorgeous visuals. I'd still recommend it for those who want a proper ""Walking Dead-esque"" experience.

Note: Apparently, the data collection in the game is ... wild, to say the least. Other reviews cover it extensively. So, be warned.",1705583201,1705583201,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This game isn't just a joyride; it's a heart-pounding, gut-wrenching roller coaster through a post-apocalyptic landscape that'll leave you on the edge of your gaming seat.

Visually, it's a feast for the eyes. From lush greenery to the cracked roadways, every pixel feels like it's been handcrafted to perfection. From sun-scorched dunes, arid expanses to desolate highways, each locale meticulously designed to convey a sense of both beauty and decay. The world isn't just a backdrop; it's a character, constantly evolving with dynamic weather that adds a layer of immersion you won't see coming. 

Your ride-or-die companion in this chaos? A protagonist whose journey is as kick ass as the combat encounters. With a performance that's more than just lines on a screen, you're not playing a game; you're living a gritty, emotional saga in the midst of a world gone mad.

Story-wise, it's a wild ride through loyalty, betrayal, and all the juicy drama you'd want in an apocalyptic epic. Your choices matter, and the consequences hit hard, turning the game into a gripping narrative where you're not just a player but a survivor fighting against the odds.

Gameplay? Hold onto your controllers and keyboards. Your bike isn't just a mode of transportation; it's your lifeline. Navigating through hordes of freakish enemies is a dance of bullets, explosions, and adrenaline-pumping escapes. It's like a symphony of chaos, and you're the rockstar orchestrating the madness.

In a sea of post-apocalyptic titles, this one's a standout. Whether you're a seasoned apocalypse veteran or a newbie to the genre, this game is your golden ticket. Get ready for a wild ride, where every decision is a game-changer, and survival isn't just a goal—it's a way of life.

I wanted to love this game so bad, and I kind of do in spite of its flaws. Love, and hate title for me.
**some potential spoilers**
The graphics are freaking amazing! Movies and Games always make me wish I could afford a house in Oregon or Washington.

The Fear was real the first time I tried this game, but when I actually started getting decent I was knifing, using the pistol, and able to conserve ammo most of the time for Hordes.

The beefy boys although annoying and bugged out a few times were so freaking fun. There hits did not feel cheap. What did bother me is their health level. Of course it made sense but still did not feel fair because the lower level zombies kind of ruin the fun of the beefy boys with their jank.

For such a diverse game, and being located in Oregon I was expecting more diversity than what we got. Yes this is still the best game and story i've read in a long time in regards to Diversity, but Deacon or even Boozer could have been anything but white. They clearly realized this mentioning Deacon does come off as racist but is not.

I kind of wish we could have customized Deacon to are liking and made the choice ourselves to have other romances and have that affect Deacon's relationship with Sarah. I get why they did not do it still wanted it though.

Not a single person recognizes how good Deacon is at taking down the Hordes BS! The man has killed thousands of zombies nearly clearly the entire half of the state, including Ambush camps and the freaking Reapers by his freaking self! And no one acknowledges it? Are you freaking kidding me? The only person that kind of does without saying anything is Lisa.

Things ruined by game logic: If a person takes a baseball axe to the face either better be dead or on the ground. If a person gets shot with a sawed off or pump action shotgun in the leg or body better be on the ground and unable to get up.

Zombies are fiction as of right now, so to each their own; It will always bother me when basic zombies can climb, open doors, and move fast. Story somewhat makes it work.

Even though the story explains it the Zombies having an attack at all feels like total crap. Now if it was just the extra creepy beefy boys than I'd be more understandable. But when I died because the zombies were given cheap shots (I rolled away and they still make contact pull me back to the horde) broke my immersion more than once to almost rage quitting.

Maybe a person problem: I was expecting the Nero sites to make Deacon almost super human. Border line zombie speed, and strength. Would have explained him not needing to eat ever and be able to take down the 50+ let alone the 100+ Hordes. At the end of the day Nero sites are useless. If you git good like some say you could beat the entire game without them.

Guns are broken as H***. The only guns that did not break my immersion were the most powerful weapons in the game. If the damage output was better the gunplay would be better than every Rockstar game ever.

Sniper Rifle is also kind of broken. If you know anything about guns they might break your immersion. From a certain distance they don't hit the target and the target may or may not acknolwdge it.
Late game Deacon (before end game) at least for me became super buggy for some reason. The zombies as well.

Stealth is absolutely freaking broken. When it does work it makes you want to do it more and you will end up realizing how broken it freaking eyes. The stupid eye will be grayed out and the Ambush camps (bandits basically) will still be aware of your location even if you move.

Why the actual heck is every single person Deacon comes across is so good at hand to hand combat and darn near John Wick level marksman? These are supposed to be people who just so happened to survive out of sheer luck and I call bull crap. The snipers especially. Three or four I understand. When I realized every single Ambush camp sniper and melee fighter (clubs no guns) were experts being able to eventually dodge Deacon's blade it broke my immersion to almost rage quitting.

Holy Crap the ending made me love the characters that struggled to make me like them through 80% if not 90% of the story. For the longest time I was like why should care about any of these people that were being mean for zero reason to Deacon. Even after they did have a reason it was feeling 100% unjustified. If you think Deacon deserves because of the reasons given think about all the work he puts in them doing what they did is 100% justified. 

Everyone wants something from Deacon and Boozer who do what is demanded of them without true lip. And when Deacon and Boozer need something they get real lip. No wonder Lisa. Lisa is my favorite character who was almost ruined story wise because they needed more shocking drama similar to Walking Dead back in the day, and I almost rage quit the game just like I quit watching Walking Dead for the same reason.",1705429481,1705429481,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. rich story.
2. great after apocalypse biker atmosphere
3. bike control in this game is really nice.
4. Variety of weapons to use.
5. Skills system is great, you can even access high tier skill in early game if you invest point on that category, also it's easy to gain skill point.
---------- Cons ----------
1. Bike fuel tank always leak. You have to find fuel tank every 1 minute and I really mean actual ""one"" minute. It's like find fuel game. It's not a bug.
2. To buy or upgrade gun / bike, you have to increase reputation in that camp which almost end game to access those upgrade. It should be in early game.
3. To upgrade annoying leak fuel tank, most useful upgrade available in late game which only few missions left to play so you ride the leak fuel tank bike entire game.
4. Some mission force you to ride across the map and listen to same drama, just skip
5. Same mission like hiding and listen to NERO Resercher, kidnap all days mission.
6. Gun Accuracy in this game is the worst and there's bug that cause your gun shot missed even though you use ""Focus"" to slow time and you point the gun exactly at the zombie.
7. Don't even have a single boss.
8. Snipers all over the map and they 1 shot destroy your bike, they never miss a shot.
9. Poor choice of refill ammo. If you don't pick up enemy weapon you can only refill ammo from ammo box because all weapons you buy have different bullet type from all enemies.
10. Most of the time you fight human. Story barely mention zombie. The last mission don't have a single zombie.
11. Shotgun completely useless.",1646138813,1705406605,False,4,0,0.47690245509147644,0,True,False,False

Now, some problems here. The UI is manageable but glitched a time or two. A restart fixed it.

Some of the mechanics or gameplay elements are poorly implemented. These mechanics are good in concept, but failed in execution. An example would be certain 'mystery events' that you encounter. Without giving too much away, suffice it to say that sometimes an 'event' happens, your map alerts you, and by the time you get there it's already happened and congrats - you did not save the people or do the thing you were supposed to because you're a slow ass motherfucker (I guess?). No, it does not matter that you literally drove your bike over cliffs to get there.

The game can easily be placed, in concept, among Red Dead and Witcher 3. You play a social outsider. But Days Gone feels far more novel and niche - a biker in a post apocalyptic hellscape is a surprisingly unique framework that doesn't require the magical hand waving of fantasy nor the archaic mythology of the wild west.

I will say that 'hordes' are an annoying but unique, interesting, and enjoyable situation you have to deal with at times. Now, I did say annoying, and I meant it, but I recognize that my dislike of the mechanic does not necessarily mean it's a bad mechanic. But anyway, the mechanic had its place in the game and worked well.

The main story is great. The cinematic elements and their attending soundtracks left a deep impression on me as the player. I can really tell that the devs wanted to make excellent tonality, and they succeeded.

The characters and their voice acting are amazing, each showing not only depth and uniqueness but dynamic progression. 

The narrative design work is peppered throughout in a pleasing, consistent fashion that rewards the grind you have to do at times. 

A small number of the side quests are genuinely interesting, though most are quite repetitive - but this is a trope of the open world genre, I think.

The drive mechanic is fun (I'm bad at it). 

The weakness is the UI, which at times feels built 'too much' for console. Crafting is overly simplified and yet somehow obnoxiously necessary. The weapons are tiered - meaning that cool gun you like won't mean shit in the next area, so why buy it? The faces of some of the characters are weirdly blank during some of the cut scene dialogues - not sure why. 

8/10 - this game deserved a better rep than it apparently got in 2021. Not even sure how I missed it back then. Hope a studio picks it up to do a sequel. Wish I had Musk money, I'd do it in a heartbeat even if sequels tend to fall short of their predecessors.

The PC Steam release worked well for me with little to no issues. Got this at a big year end discount <$20 so it was definitely well worth the money.

STORY:  The story is great, character building and emotions are realistic for a post-apocalyptic setting. People grow apart, undergo traumatic events and change or stay true to themselves. The protagonist resonates with me a lot.  

VISUAL/AUDIO:  Not quite there compared to Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2, 2018), but that's an incredibly high bar. Still pretty decent, the light effects from dusk through dawn are great. Night visuals and the starry sky are awesome.
No dizziness for a 3rd person perspective, although it can get annoying in enclosed spaces due to field depth issues. 
Kudos to the voice actors and animation, their voice acting and facial expressions are pretty on point. 
Gotta hand it to the sound effects team. The zombies groans/screeches/grunts/etc ALWAYS make my skin crawl through the game, akin to hearing someone scratch a blackboard with fingernails. Ugh.

GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS:  Some survival mechanics are a chore and somewhat pointless, especially scrapping for materials. Unsure why there's lengthy animation sequences needed for some tasks (getting meat from game). RDR2 had an extensive sequence of skinning animals to promote realism, since that fit the theme of the time. Sticking a hunting knife into a bear or deer in Days Gone to gain a sliver of meat is stupid.

Tons of buildings littered throughout the world, but majority are useless. Would be nice if we were rewarded for combing through all of them with special upgrades, but it's just more of the same, and items get replenished every so often. Eventually you get all you need from camps and ignore all the random loot lying around, which makes them pointless midway through the game.

Fighting mechanics are decent, feels a lot better than RDR2, but human AI is pretty dumb. Hordes do always keep the tension up given the swarm tactics. Wish there was a way to up the number of zombies. Difficulty level just caps them at Hard II. Survival mode seems to only remove the HUD which makes it annoying rather than difficult.",1705338238,1705338681,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First off, this game is not the Last of Us, so I’d kill those expectations first. I’d give the story and story telling about a B- overall but that doesn’t mean I don’t want more. There’s enough (story) here by the way that could have probably filled two games or one and a dlc, but to me I take that as two for the price of one.
Its open world mechanics aren’t exactly anything new. They do give you a motorcycle to navigate the world easier which can be upgraded and the map is huge and fortunately feels varied despite all of it basically being based on US west coast forest. Some of the recurring side events (and some story ones) I did find very repetitive which is about the only thing I am not looking forward to on a new play through.
Deacon the main character is a positive standout which is a huge plus, much credit goes to the actor playing him. I never even found his consistent mumblings to himself to get old despite the 20+ hours of gameplay. In fact all the performances are pretty solid.
The zombies (freakers) hordes are far and away the best mechanic of the game and there’s plenty of encounters to keep them threatening. It’s (in a good way) quite jarring to stumble upon an army of them unprepared. I remember these hordes were used for marketing the game and ultimately is what makes the game standout from the other apocalyptic zombie games. Time will tell how long that lasts. I think as other future games implement similar mechanics into their games Days Gone will lose some of its novelty.
This is a big reason as to why the game  just really needs a sequel. The developers need a real chance to follow up with what this world really can be. It’s set up for it. I can’t help but think of Mass Effect; if we only had the first game we would’ve only had a taste of what could have been. Fortunately Mass Effect 2 came out and made the series what it is.
This game needs to be a series. It needs its Mass Effect 2. It would become great.

Some parts of the game are a lot of fun, riding the bike from one area to another is enjoyable.  Also, sneaking through the woods towards a camp and taking each person out with a silenced weapon is extremely satisfying.

Sadly, it's the combat mechanics that let the game down badly, they are slow to respond and feel awkward, especially when taking on more than one opponent at close range.

Movement of your character is slow and sometimes unresponsive and for some reason the devs decided that your character should be pixel perfect when picking anything up.

1. 90% of this game is cinematics. Granted its an interesting story, but too many times, at the end of a long play session I just want to save the game, but have to sit through the rest of a cinematic that just takes way too long. Maybe its a personal thing, but I just don't enjoy games that have to tell long drawn out stories. If I wanted a good story I could watch Netflix.

2. Some glitches in the game like trying to select a throwable and it won't select it on my character after countless tries. Meanwhile I get battered by zombies or zombie birds while trying to select molotoves which I know I have because my weapon wheel shows I have 3/3 in inventory. The same thing with trying to throw rocks to distract enemies. I think I have the rock selected because I clearly selected it, only to throw a damn smoke grenade. 

3. Positioning to open up cars hoods, trunks, doors etc requires having to have the character in an exact spot before the animation gets triggered, usually ends up fiddling constantly with WASD keys. Its ok while not in the heat of battle but when you're in a hurry it often leaves you vulnerable. 

4. You need to have enough time set aside to play. An hour session really only leaves you about 10% of actual game play while 90% of it is spent in dialog with other NPC's. And God forbid you have to be near your bike to save the game. Not sure if thats a shortcoming on the devs part or just some silly joke. 

I've got almost 30 hours invested and I do want to see how the story ends on my own without watching any videos. But this will be my only play-through and then its getting uninstalled as I just don't see this game as anything that has replay-ability. 

If you enjoy story driven games (which I get, some people do), then by all means get it. However, I can't give this game a good recommendation. Its got good gameplay elements for sure, but it should be the majority of your time spent playing, not sitting back at your pc watching character/NPC dialog.",1704594067,1705043443,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some parts of the Game are amazing and some are just lazy made.
Here grab some:
===============================================================================
+Decent Story - good but bland, most of it is predictable, nothing really special.
+Difficulty - fair , not too easy from start to middle of the game , tho end game is quite simple.
+++Motorcycle - amazing, driving it around , customize, physics . Well Done 
++ Gun play , inventory, crafting and items - Good , shooting is great , but there could be more crafted items, 
also throwables (only need about 1-2 Molotov's for a Horde , the rest is cut down to Rifle or LMG)
+Npc's and Dialogues - lovely, voice acting is on point .
++++The World - Stunning, the whole playable area is eye catching. Ambient is amazing , really has that zombie apocalypse feeling to it , and the Soundtrack is a cherry on the cake .
==============================================================================
No's:
---BUGS - a lot of bugs, the NPc's getting stuck in place, or just standing idle , loading the game back coz the mission is stuck (happend too many times), bodies flying, vaulting over does not work when you need it most of the time, Enemy loosing sight of you in middle of the fight (-.-') 
-- Melee - hit hit hit, space , hit hit hit ..... rinse and repeat...
- Stealth - simple , again nothing special.
-- Overlaping dialogues - few times 5 diffrent dialogues goes on in the same time.Also Protagonist never shuts up. 
-- Too much stuff happening all in once - Imagine you go to take out the bandit camp, while you shoot them the horde attacks , and then a Bear from nowhere emerges and a Wolf Pack, a bunch of Deers running through and a gang on Bikes shows up i dont know if that is intended , doesnt feel like it is... happends too often . 
-- Not many activities , camp clearing ( rippers, anarchist, bandits, militia) feels no diffrent , Horde clearing ( is good , but kinda the same shit over and over ) and NERO checkpoint clearing , thats pretty much it. 

TL:DR:
Good game , nice Story, decent gameplay with few bad features , amazing World, and Ambient, also the Music makes it twice better. Arcade Style Zombie Apocalypse game, with Realistic Aspects . 
Overrally my humble opinion:

Not because the characters are better, because they aren't, or the graphics are prettier, because they also aren't, or the world is larger or more interactive, because none of that either.

But the gameplay does nearly everything RDR2 does, except in a simpler, not over-animated way, and the simplicity is what makes this game great. You have survivor camps instead of towns, simple barter and upgrade systems, fast travel that uses petrol. You have a bike instead of a horse.

Lots of side quest lines, lots of activity on the map, lots of opportunities to loot, explore, and scavenge. Main story line is a kinda 'TESCO Value Walking Dead' at bits, but isn't bad at all, keeps you engaged on long term, I actually cared how the characters end up or if they survive or not.

The bandits and wild animals I worried in Red Dead 2 got replaced with zombies. From child-sized to massive mutants that survive multiple headshots, from small groups to vast screaming hordes of hundreds. Nobody can prepare you for the first fight with a horde.

Of course, there are still bandits.
And wild animals. And zombie wild animals (OH GOD, THE BEARS)

The greatest adversaries are the infected and religion instead of the law and capitalism like in RDR. Sadly lacking survival system, though, but big open world, investigation missions, bounty hunting, zombie hunting, animal hunting, picking flowers and making your own crossbow bolts like a big boy. 

Incredibly simple and easy looting/crafting dynamic, lack of tuberculosis, decent melee, good ranged combat. Traps, bombs, explosives, the environment can all be utilised to take out the infected, and humanity's oldest and worst enemy: other humans.

I can't say a single thing I don't like about this game, even it's poorest qualities are mid at worst.

A break from the standard zombie formula, I thought exploring the beautifully rendered PNW on my custom adventure bike would be engrossing with a somewhat forlorn but hopeful ambiance.  Instead, the world is pointlessly and inexplicably overrun by zombies; seriously, the zombie population density in the Oregon wilderness is higher than pre-outbreak modern NYC.  It makes no sense.

The characters are as unlikable as they are 1-dimensional, leaving you incapable of empathizing with any of them.  It seems like every 30 seconds somebody is calling me on the radio to tell me their problems, often the same person two or three times in a row.  Of course as soon as that's done, another poorly executed post-apocalypse prepper radio program comes on that you skip as soon as your finger can find the correct key.  I cannot recall how often I was just saying ""shut up"" at the screen.

The ""ambiance"" around other NPCs, such as in the initial settlement you use as a base of operations, is reminiscent of Skyrim, and not in a good way.  It's arrows to the knee times a hundred.  Every time you turn, the nearest NPC or two are commenting on you, and you automatically respond as only a tortured, emo, 1-dimensional, backwards-baseball-cap wearing 1%er stereotype would deem appropriate.

Being left in peace to explore the world is extremely rare, and when it does happen, you unfortunately discover just how empty the world is, not simply of people, but of stories, lore, and imagination.

These shortcomings are exacerbated by the many niggling little mechanical annoyances.

Like many (but not all) 3rd person perspective games, Days Gone has a setup where, shortly after you've stopped actively changing your view while driving/riding, it will turn back towards the direction of travel.  In order to keep your eyes on something to the side or behind you, you have to first move it into view, and then constantly jiggle or adjust the mouse to prevent the game from automatically recentering.  If you're a game developer reading this, take note: It's not welcome.  Stop screwing with my view after I've put it where I want it.  I know how to turn it back if I want to, believe me.

Random encounters can interfere with scripted missions, causing you to lose them and restart the mission, which may also force you to listen to a not insignificant amount of dialog.  I had to play the first bike chase (I'm assuming there are more to come) no less than three times after getting too far away from my prey.  The first time, it was because the game decided to randomly spawn wolves on top of me as soon as the NPC appeared, knocking me down and delaying my pursuit just long enough to prevent catching up.  The second time, the wolves did not appear, but the person I was tasked with chasing collided with my parked bike as they rode past, spinning it around and knocking it over.

The activation controls are horribly wonky within the world.  You hold down the key, a circle builds up, and if you're lucky the action you're trying to accomplish will take place.  More often than that though, you don't start in precisely the right position, so you'll be slowly moved towards the correct spot while the circle fills, after which you'll stop and the activation icon will remain until you release it and start again.  Of course you'll hear Manny comment once again how he didn't know it was your bike, because hey, he hasn't told you that 3471 times already this visit.

Finally the save ""mechanic"" is inexcusibly lame.  It's not classic Resident Evil lame, but it's lame.  You can only save near your bike, or near a bed.  You can't just save ""anywhere.""  This is so intolerably lame that I just can't express it.  I can save wherever I want in a 12 year old game like Fallout 3, but not here in the PNW.  Gotta be near the bike.

Maybe some day I'll reinstall this game and give it another chance, but for now, it's uninstalled with barely 3 hours in.  It's unfortunate I didn't really figure all this out in the first two hours, so I'd have a chance at a refund.

Note to Steam and different game devs: This sort of experience is why I refuse to buy any games that are not at least 35% off, and while I wait for most of them to be 50% off or greater.  Since you won't allow a secondary (read: used) game market for digital games, meaning I cannot resell them to recoup some of the expense, I'm forced to just wait until they go on sale.",1638302647,1704903984,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Truthfully, I wasn't expecting too much out of this game, and prepared myself for another typical zombie apocalypse scenario that's been played out many, many times before.  (Though to be fair, to a certain extent there's really not too much innovation in some aspects of this game.  Combat is typical 3rd person shooter style with stealth elements, there's a crafting system to create make-shift weapons with the random junk you find out in the world.  So nothing particularly new here.)

However!  What really makes it shine are the characters and the environment itself.   The attention to detail and world building was something that I truly wasn't expecting to keep me engaged - but it did!  The characters were strangely compelling (big kudos to the voice actors!) and the beautiful vistas of Oregon were truly breathtaking.  

Not to mention the incredible sound design, along with the dynamic weather effects.  It really immerses you into the environment.  There's nothing quite like hiding from a ravenous horde of 'freaks', as you take refuge in a small shack, hearing the pattering sounds of rain hitting against the metal roof, as you desperately pray they don't find you.  Good times.

Honestly, if it wasn't on sale, I probably wouldn't have picked this game up.  But I'm glad I did.  Would recommend!",1704774482,1704774482,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game does not tell you much until about ten hours into playing it, which seems an odd choice of playstyle. Deacon's girlfriend gets stabbed during the outbreak, but her whereabouts are left a mystery, as to Deacons memories of the past two years, which you will not see till you play the game further on. Again this seems to give the game a poor way to start and play, but as you explore, the game evolves further as to the chaos of the last two years. It also explains the expired day counter which is on the main menu. 

Your basically learning more about the ""outbreak"" and why the area is so infested with zombies. You need to get out of the area alive, but things simply do not go your way, your bike is stolen for parts, you have your injured buddy and not much to heal him. You will face hordes of zombies, ambushes, people with agendas, mad survivalists to name a few problems.

Emergency government triage teams infest the area as well, covertly looking for answers too, as to why the zombies are so aggressive, usual governmental conspiracy cover up story. You will also face other surprises along the way, such as wolves, some bad luck and many other obstacles before you can leave this town for good. 

There are a few tutorials to get you started too, basics in movement, gameplay, weapons, crafting and how to upgrade your skills, however the game places a lot of limits on what you can carry initially and what you can craft at the start of the game, which leaves you really equipped very bascially at the start. You will spend half the game foraging for items to be able to use most of the weapons you craft or find, that you can only store half and carry even less.

Ammo, arrows, med kits, scrap for repairs, all need to be found. You can barter for some of these items, but you need to exchange missions and/or trade animal furs/zombie ears if you want to get anything meaningful. You also have transport in that you have a bike too, but its often the first thing that gets damaged or targeted, you will need to keep it repaired and fuelled if you want to get around the area map.  

The game looks nice, there are day and night cycles, although the time only appears on the map screen, which is a little inconvenient, also night time is a bit brighter and looks a lot like day, so you may want to adjust the gamma or use the darker night mod to truly inspire the terror of exploration in the twilight hours.

There are also weather patterns with sunny spells, rain and windy showers, all render quite nicely. The graphics are suitably somber in places and music plays differently depending on the perceived danger you might be in. Deacon can sometimes move fairly slowly at the start so its up to you to find upgrades and skills that make his abilities better, that also includes the bike as some ""secret"" items are dependant on your bike being able to traverse large gaps with nitrous boosts. (which of course you need to barter for). 

There are also collectables to be found, herbs, stims, magazines, recordings, but a lot is just used for trust levels so you can barter, the rest is basically junk unless your an avid collector for game completion. The zombies themselves all vary in designs, some will run away from you, some wont, some will leap on you, it varies.

People on the other hand seem intent on harming you mostly, ambush you at every opportunity on the highways, beware of traps. A few people will help you for a price too, its upto you to work out who and when. You can turn some of this to your advantage with a well placed arrow that causes a bit of chaos, people/zombies will then turn on each other sometimes if you get the right equipment and you dont blow yourself up in the process. 

Saving the game is a bit of a mixed bag, you need your bike or a bed, so if you leave it behind you may find yourself missing out on a long save. Fast travel will not work on an area you have not cleared in terms of nests, so only works when your bike is close and will cost you money and gas as well. Speaking of time, you can fast forward time by simply going to bed, night turns to day, day turns to night. This affects zombie behavior as during the day they are weaker, night time you are more likely to get your head ripped off. You do get xp for killing zombies and missions, but weapons have limited uses, so choose wisely. 

There are plenty of missions to accomplish, side and minor quests to help you on your way, some are hidden deliberately, but keep an eye out for downed choppers, medical sites, these sometimes offer permanent bonus stims that you can boost Deacon's health and stamina with, (amongst other things). Be aware even these missions may contain some form of ""trap"", in that you need to look before you leap (so to speak), Some missions are timed, some are opportunistic and can disappear if you do not investigate them. 

It is at this point you begin to realise this game plays out a lot like another zombie survival game, state of decay. It is also at this point you realise the limits of this game, combat is fairly okay, but no weapon blocking, you can dodge or knock zombies down (with the right skills invested of course).

You can find encampments (some are not friendly!) and trade for missions, these are used to get better weapons, seems each camp has a speciality in terms of weapons/engine parts, so it encourages exploration. This does mean your constantly on the lookout for fuel, but the main highway has other pitfalls when you traverse it.

Some missions can be a little frustrating as your weapons and certain options are deliberately disabled by the story telling, Apparently scientists are immune to bullets, so you cant kill them, just observe. lots of loading segments in some sections, small persistant movie interruptions for a pc game this can be a bit jarring. (clearly console ported) and quite annoying at times. 

Weapons decay in durability  can often catch you out in the middle of a fight, your bike falls apart over time with damage, you need to constantly scavenge and refuel for items to use. Items are scattered everywhere so you can usually find everything you need generally, its just the constant foraging that starts to get boring after a while, your weapons durability drops so fast too, so your constantly fixing them. It becomes a drag to play for longer periods after a while, because your not really doing anything in the game. It does make makes missions seem a lot longer than they probably are.

Speaking of missions they are varied, but some are timed, place restrictions on what you can and cannot do, you have all this freedom and then the game takes it away from you very quickly for ridiculous reasons. oh an apparently wolves can rip you off a moving vehicle at a 100 miles an hour, hmm okay.  I am invested in furthering the story, but sometimes I just want to save the game and exit for a bit and take a break.  The story itself seems absent till about  ten hours in, then suddenly you figure out what is going on partially,  once you get past that, things get interesting. Nest hunting is a tad dull and predictable, but necessary if you want to unlock fast travel points.

I would still recommend the game, but I would wait till its on sale, the genre has already been done before several times. Night times need adjusting as they are far too bright. Also some quests disable fuel requirements for storytelling, how convenient.

Pros: The game has some beautiful graphics, varied playstyles, melee or ranged combat, crafting, etc.

Cons: Story does not kick in for quite a long while, can put people off playing, repetitive gameplay can get boring in long sessions.",1704594799,1704756313,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You will eventually reach a point where you have the ability to and are prepared enough to take on all the cool scenes from the trailers and game footage but it is an extremely slow burner and much of that content is in fact optional and very skippable which is disappointing because you want to fight hordes of zombies in your zombie game, not hordes of really boring human enemies.

Story is good if a bit cliche, especially since the zombie apocalypse takes a backseat for the vast majority of it and you're focusing more on people and their problems than the giant roaming hordes of infected.

Graphically the game is brilliant and they do a lot with it, it looks amazing and plays very well.

It's hard to say if I'd recommend this game, it's quite average all things considered especially when you consider the time commitment to ""get to the good bit"" (about 20 hours) and the insane size of the world with the limitations you're given until much later into the game with bike upgrades. If you're okay with that then it's pretty good but if not you could easily skip it and not miss out on much. There is a lot of content if you're okay with very repetitive open world segments with little variation but if you don't you will get bored of it fast.

I really enjoyed the story and the progression get is fairly solid. The first time you turn a corner and come face to face with 70 zombies and they all start chasing you it really gets your blood flowing. Gun Play, Stealth, and travel are all great. As you get better tools and learn how to survive the game slowly changes but you never feel safe when out in the world. The story is a bit more of an A- than an A+ and does have its hiccups but in general is satisfying. Bugs were few and far between but they were still these as you might expect in an open world game. Characters are all pretty well written and mostly have good motivations.  I will also say as a Biker, some of the biker related things are a little off, but on par with most Hollywood stuff.

If you like Farcry and want something a bit different and more serious with survival horror elemants, this is your game. In all, great game.

Days Gone is an entertaining and fun open world action horror adventure game that follows a bounty hunter Deacon a drifter. Deacon is a drifter that is struggling for survival in a post apocalyptic world that's infested with infected with zombie like people, bad guys who are trying to survive, and a cult that are disturbed and insane. Days Gone is a fun game. I had trouble getting into it when I first started.

The graphics were a bit iffy at first. The opening cutscene cut right into the chase without you being emotionally invested into the characters. The opening scene of Deacon, and his wife Sarah, and Boozer who are trying to escape a war torn city. As the infected population is increasing. Two years later, Deacon is on the search for Sarah. While him and Boozer are drifters from one camp to another. Just doing their camp chore work. Such as looking for a guy who went awol. Or helping them defend their camps from other bad guys or cults. I think the first half of the game is hard to get into. Cause the missions were repetitive and similar. After Deacon comes across Iron Mike's camp. The plot finally starts making progress with its storyline. With Iron Mike's camp facing against the threat of Skinners cult group. And Deacon conflicted with where his loyalties lies.

The game is fun after getting past the first half of the game. Driving your bike in the open world is fun and scary at times. You may come across bad guys who will plan traps to get you off your bike. Or the scary threat of running into a horde of undead. Which is like a scene from World War Z movie. As an army of dead are chasing after you. You better hope you wont fall off your bike or drive into a dead end.

The missions become fun after a while. Your character goes on a rescue mission to rescue one of their own. Or planning a defense mission on trying to save your camp. I enjoyed the main missions more. The bounty hunter missions was becoming repetitive. Finding the guy you need to go after and it always ends in a motorcycle bike chase. Which is boring.

It is a long game if your trying to do the main missions. Like I said the first half is slow moving. It eventually picks up. And you can not put the controller down after that. The plot is good. Deacon is on the search for his wife. While the side missions of Deacon getting information from a guy in a research facility. Informing him about the undead. Which gets really good in the end. Plus there is a secret ending foreshadowing what is to become if a sequel happens.

The graphics get better throughout the game. The details of the open world. The game play is fun. It does get annoying when certain guns are weaker than others. Like you need to buy an upgraded weapon for certain enemies. Which means you have to do the optional missions to build your camp trust.

The story is good. Slow at first but ends in a fun action packed way. I would love to see a sequel from this game. And see where the story goes next.

Overall, Days Gone is a good action packed fun game. It has some intense and scary moments of being chased or the thrills of fighting other bad guys in this open world. The first several missions are repetitive and boring.

HOW MANY BODIES? has a nero camp in which you need to disable speakers before powering up the generator, except you have to power up the generator in order to find two of them that are invisible until after you power up the generator. You can immediately power off the generator to try and not attract attention of the nearby horde but finding the speakers becomes difficult and dangerous if you don't have a silencer on your gun/rifle to shoot the speakers down with.

The RETRIEVE YOUR MONGRELS CUT map misleads you to a building which has a wide open entrance to retrieve some valuable items, but the game itself blocks you from entering.

-The open world is just stunning, and I found it to be more alive than GTA5, Assassin Creed's open worlds. This quality of the open world encouraged me to keep exploring, and not use fast travel.

The developers made it competently, but there's tons of little things that just throw you off and make you not wanna pick it up. Compare it to a game like RDR2 and it just falls flat on its ass. 

Combat. Kinda sucks. It ain't good. It ain't horrible.

Sound design. Horrible. No idea where the zombies are coming from because there's no surround sound? What the F? 
Zombie could be in front of you or behind and make the same damn noise in your headphones. What a joke.

Voice acting. Good, but not perfect. And considering how narrative driven and immersive it's trying to be, it needs to be better. Need second takes for a lot of this shit. Sometimes the delivery is all god damn wrong. Really takes you out of the game.

Motorcycle driving: Really good. 

Story: Not that good, either. Writing is basic. Not horrible.

World immersion: Stupid. Doesn't work. You see your brother in your camp and you can't talk to him. You go outside your camp, and he talks to you on the radio instantly.

Story and dialogue is so predictable and it feels like it was written for non-adult audience. There are a few bits that are great, but overall not a memorable experience. 
The amount of cutscenes is CRAZY. It's basically half of the game. The ratio favoring cutscenes in spite of gameplay in tense scenarios just totally kill the vibe and make me suffer through more childish sounding dialogues. Sometimes there's even cutscene within a cutscene. Many times  2 min cutscene - 10s of forced slow walk gameplay - 2 min cutscene... like, WHY?
Also first half of the game (20h) feels like a drag and 90 % of it is completely irrelevant to the overall story. The motorbike even after a few upgrades drives slow and eats too much gas. 
There's really a lot of things that feels janky and sadly I was hardly not agitated by something every few minutes.

The greatest example of ""Underrated"" game? 
Beautiful, simply put.
I would not expect that but Days Gone became my most loved title.

Days Gone is an Action/Open World with zombies as the main theme but the centre of the story is the main character: Deacon trying to find his wife that he saved at the start of Zombie outbreak. Entire story or at least majority of it is focused on a journey of Deacon, trying to discover what happened to his wife.

Game looks like pretty generic console/sony style game: Great visuals, in my opinion outstanding dubbing and open world with many side activities to do. That would be a greatest bait in gaming history.
Under some boring chores, exhausting early game, Days Gone hides an absolute gem of a game. 

Let me tell you, despite not being a huge sport/car games fan, I absolutely love gameplay loop that follows motorcycle. During early game you really have to watch out for fuel as this is your main form of transportation. Upgrades are meaningul and customization is quite huge for something that is addition to the main gameplay.
Zombie Hordes are terrific, they can easily clap you even on easy difficulty and there is no Skyrim bullshit that lets you solo whole camp without using brain cause you are high level.
Characters are quite memorable, Deacon will often comment situation, he can be scared, sad and in despair, no Hero Journey bullshit, he often seems realistic. I expect someone facing a horde of zombies to curse under the nose. 

Soundtrack is perfect and ride to the new location will leave you speechless. Chase music still plays in my head rent-free. 

Overall it is literally a Geneva Convention Violation that we did not get second part because of reviewers with brain cells equal to Game Journalists. Solid recommed, especially if you can get it with discount.",1685180764,1704474339,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It is so personable with characters and I actually felt depressed when I completed it because I didn't want it to end. the story line itself was a masterpiece, let alone the character interactions, the character stories, etc.. I felt so immersed in the story alone, that it took me through some emotions during the story progression. Don't get me wrong, some of the side missions did get a bit boring at times, but the main story was incredible!

The whole map was beautiful and so much attention to detail, the enemies also kept me on the edge of my seat at times, especially the BIG groups..

I am so disappointed to find that a sequel is unlikely to come out, as I can only imagine what that game could've been like... I definitely recommend this game to anyone unsure!

Technical side of the game; I had no issues whatsoever with lag, crashes, etc. I played on high quality graphics and my PC specs are decent, but nothing flash. For the excellent quality of graphics and gameplay, no complaints here. Worked with my PS4 controller fine, with steam input active.

But once you get tough enough and well equipped, you could take on a horde and defeat it. The open world is just awesome, you can explore vast areas on foot and on your bike.

The not so great parts of this game, for me, might not turn everyone off but it does for me. I dislike the characters so far, the voice acting is pretty rough on Deek and unfortunately he narrates everything you're doing: if you get a headshot your character literally says ""mm good, headshot."" That may not sound too bad but there isn't a moment in this game where Deek isn't talking/thinking for the player.

Another aspect of this game I don't like is the cringe dialogue. The characters seem to be conservative libertarian types which I tend to butt heads with. And since I can't relate much at all with them I have a hard time getting invested in the story, especially when the voice acting is so inconsistent with its quality. 

The game itself runs well, with no FSR or DLSS I might add. The world is very nice looking with lots of foliage and detail, however the interactivity is lacking. You can vault over walls and obstacles but occasionally you'll come across a wall thats just as tall or shorter than walls you've vaulted over before but for whatever reason you can't over this or that one. Your character also sometimes wants to bug out when trying to open a car's hood while standing too close to a wall. Overall, the way your character controls is pretty okay but its not perfect. 

The driving is nice and neat, I like that quite a bit but because this is a zombie world, gas is limited so just be aware of that and get off the bike when you can afford to. This game wants you to conserve your resources. 

I've tried this game over and over, twice on steam, twice on console. I've wanted to like this game but unfortunately the clunk and the cringe keeps me from its potential. Hopefully you'll have a better time than me. This is definitely The Last of Us for conservatives, but one thing this game has over The Last of Us is that this game runs on PC and the other one was a horrible mess by a bad porting studio.",1704388544,1704391715,False,0,1,0.400641024112701416,0,True,False,False

When you finally face him it's a silly mini game that is easily won. Roll towards him. Then you kill him in the end game cutscene that follows. He's not even a great villian. He so obviously betrays you at some point in the game and despite being a supernatural tracker/bounty hunter you never go after him. It's not even an option. Which brings up how cheesy and predictable the story is. Nothing you haven't seen before. On top of that you are constantly interrupted by getting attacked by random shit even when you're already in combat. Ex: Wolves spawning, running up and biting you in the middle of gun fight. The game constantly gets in the way of it's own immersion and gives you much less agency than you think you'll get in an open world game. It never really felt challenging as much as annoying. Also too few buttons do too many things. How many times have you tried to jump and rolled instead or vice versa? This can be super frustrating when that gets you seen (while in stealth), hit, or even killed. 

Edit: With some after thought, I added a bit to the rant above and wanted to add some Pros because there are some fun concepts in the game. Which is why I bothered playing it till the end and why I was so disappointed overall. The side missions you do outside of the main story, though repetitive at times, are the best part of the game. Burning nest, stealth killing a camp of ruffians, tracking clues, fighting the hordes, etc. The action can feel rewarding when the game doesn't get in it's own way. The upgrade system is simple but works well.  Riding the bike around the wasteland can be pretty fun as well.

In a medium often criticized for its detachment, Days Gone stands as a testament to the potential of video games as a powerful storytelling platform. 

It's a journey through the depths of sorrow, the heights of redemption, and the flickering flame of hope that refuses to be extinguished. This is not just a game to be played; it's a story to be felt, an emotional odyssey that resonates with the very essence of what it means to be human.

As the credits rolled on my journey through Days Gone, I found myself yearning for more. The game's rich narrative, well-developed characters, and the immersive world they inhabit make a compelling case for a sequel that could further elevate this post-apocalyptic saga.

I have been fighting humans far more then I have been fighting the ""Freakers"" (Zombies) and more often then not, they have snipers that shoot your motorcycle and swarm you.

Destroying nests is slow and tedious. There are several, spread out over a wide area. One place has about a dozen buildings, with 5 nests in it. You keep hearing dialogue like ""There is a nest here!"" with no indication as to where ""here"" is. You end up going from building to building the entire time.

So far, the game is just OK. Glad I got it for under $20, but even then...

O'h, and not very good mouse and keyboard support (had to swap to a controller), though the game would be better (imho) with it.

Update: Still bad. Ending fight is a joke. Weakened so one hit kills you and surrounded by explosives, with the guy using a sniper rifle... no idea where your own weapons and first aid kits went. Talk about horrible game design.

Booths, bikes and even whole areas are vanishing as well, with have to reload or even restart the game. Hell, even an ENTIRE HORDE went missing, for a story mission!

The horde dynamics are brillaint and the freedom to take on enemies and zombies as you like. The story is good enough top keep you entertained. My only wish is that Sony would do a Days Gone 2. Because you know that would improve on this. Amazing game!!! Highly recommend!!!,1704229048,1704229048,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dialogue is pretty bad sometimes, story is lack luster, characters are a bit flat, custom bike skins but cannot change clothes ever even in torrential rains or inches of snow.  Lots of awkward transitions as you show up to your objective but they want it at a different time of day so the camera pans to the sky and you watch as the sun flys by and then your character does the thing, over and over and over again.  Kinda broken gameplay there fellas.  The worse bug I've found is trying to rescue three hostages kneeling on a rope bridge, killed all the bandits but there was a horde hibernating in a cave below which gave off an enemy warning on minimap, so I couldn't ever rescue the guys they just wouldn't stand up for me.  saved and loaded and the horde was still there but the guys vanished, aka the reward for doing the mission.  This has happened twice before but only with a single hostage that refused to be rescued even though no enemy can be found remaining anywhere.  Really ruins the experience.  Could have been a good spin on the Red Dead Redemption type gameplay, but feels like they released it about 30% complete.  It's passable and the combat is acceptable once you turn off the aimbot helper.  Combat felt challenging on hard mode when the game begins but after you hit level 15 or so your character feels pretty overpowered.  Would like to see a survivor mode version of this game that requires food and drink.  The story here is very linear even though there are three big camps so far that each have missions for you.  Still just forced from one zone to another along their storyline, instead of it feeling like the player is in control of where the story goes.

What this game is about is a solid story and fun with killing zombies.
What this game is not about is survival and crafting.

I think half of the game's success is related to the character (an outlaw) and the other to the mass killing of hordes (once you complete the game). 
It is a fun game. Nothing more. But I very much like the fun of it.
It is strongly entertaining but it is ultimately boring.
The difficulty only comes from the scarcity (of resources), absurd spawns and difficulty (you can be one-shot-to-the-chest  killed on Hard II but an human enemy can withstand 5-6 bullets from AK-47).
The AI is stupid and only dangerous on highest difficulty because of the abysmally overpowered enemies.
The crafting is a joke (very few craft items). 
There is no survival (no food or drink, no diseases).
The vanilla bike tank is a joke. You can drive your bike for a mere 2 miles! (with a mod 6-8 miles) 
The combat (melee especially) is one of the worst I have experienced in a decade. 

But as I have already mentioned, if you accept the above limitations and flaws (which I did before buying) and are all about killing zombies using a cool outlaw character then go for it.

Just remember to use mods (like Weapon Enhancement Project, 2x Engine Speed, Improved fuel tank mod, Throwables x3 etc.), they do make a hell of a difference.

Would I recommend it despite its flaws? Absolutely yes!

Fast travel is weird you cannot travel to all the bases.

There are two main types of story driven action/adventure games like this:

1: You are in control of your character the entire time. The story unfolds around you as you play but you never loose control of your character. You are your character. Games like Doom, Half Life, Prodeus etc

2: You're playing an adventure soap opera where you control your character in between cut scenes. Some games only have a few to add to the story while some games seem to be more about the cut scenes with some BS for you to do in between. 

This game is a solid #2

Days Gone feels like someone watched Sons of Anarchy and The Walking Dead at the same time and figured they should replace Daryl Dixon with Jax Teller. The game makes the most of revisiting certain locations at different plot points, but also misses some opportunities by putting a lot of effort into designing a location that ends up simply being a place to fight a horde (I'm looking at you Sawmill). Most of the story is pretty enjoyable, especially during the early and mid game. The highlights for me are the Boozer storyline and everything involving the Rippers. You should be able to guess the ""great reveal"" of the infection's source well before the characters arrive at it. The ending is relatively satisfying but it won't blow your mind or resolve every storyline. I also thought it was kinda dumb that nobody figured out why Deacon was in the Army camp considering it's tattooed on his goddamn neck.

I really enjoyed running down bounties, clearing out enemy camps, fighting zombie bears, and killing my first horde after spending most of the game simply running from them. The NERO camps and stealth missions escalate well in terms of difficulty. The only thing I consistently hated was showing up to a certain spot to complete or start a mission, but accidentally triggering a cutscene for a completely different mission that I'd end up being locked into. Maybe also the increasing distance of shops from the entrance of a given camp as the game went on.

There are some minor annoyances regarding the scaling of the crafting system and discovery of recipes in regards to the pacing of the game. For instance, by the time I find the recipe for poison arrows, I hadn't been using the crossbow because I already had access to a .50 sniper rifle. As convenient as it is to be able to carve up some new arrows whenever you need them and not have to buy a new silencer every time you touch camp, there's no way I was going back to the bow in terms of range and damage. I also wish I'd been able to craft some of the best melee weapons in the game instead of simply feel lucky to find them, on top of being afraid of permanently breaking them.

The biggest single letdown for me was probably being plot-stripped of all my weapons because my character keeps saying how he wants to kill the big bad traitor with his bare hands (then they have a knife fight that ends up feeling like it's over too quickly). I understood having to sneak around and get my weapons back whenever I was captured, and probably enjoyed it most of the time. I didn't really understand making me earn all this camp trust and credits to buy the best weapons in the game only for the game to take away my agency as a player at a crucial moment. 

Misgivings aside, it's a game with largely enjoyable combat mechanics and character dynamics. As I write this, it's on sale for an extremely reasonable price of $12.49.",1704005108,1704005108,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

kind of wish I could give a neutral review on this one, clearly a lot of love and care went into it, but it is also just really cliche throughout. the story is both really good in places, but overly pessimistic and dreary. to sum up the story, toxic masculinity gun nut saves the world. it felt throughout like I was taking part in an NRA ""this is why we all need guns!"" advertisement. but there are moments where the protagonist feels very human, the writers do a good job of explaining why he is so insane by the time the story starts, and he does change a bit over time.

Also some of the things that are taken for granted in the story, all humans who don't live in one of the four camps you can join are evil and need to die for instance, just don't make any sense whatsoever. like can't I just try talking to some of these people?

mostly why I don't like giving this game a +1 is because it is just so utterly hopeless, it's vision of the world is one of evil and sorrow and little else. where senselessly violent people who care a little bit sometimes are the closest thing to a hero one can expect to meet. The way deacon revels in bloodshed and killing is really gross. it definitely seems like if there were not an endless stream of monsters and 'bad guys' to fight he would just be shooting up a mall somewhere instead. 

so to sum up, it's a well made game with an interesting story but playing it made me feel kind of depressed. so, if that's your cup of tea have at it.",1702143379,1703961535,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The story line is honestly, amazing. I feel for the characters and they also express emotions extremely well. The map is beautiful and the game play is buttery smooth other than some minor bugs with AI pathing (not a huge deal tbh). For modern games, this run amazing on a 2080 at max settings. I was impressed that it came out of box able run like that as not a lot of games now a days do. Great engine optimization. 

My only issue is it seems like some of the radio calls are mistimed whether that's intentional or not I can't tell. For example, I spend like 10 minutes in a camp doing things, leave and as soon as I'm 500m away, boom there's a new job that wasn't available. I've gotten used to it but I do find the back tracking a bit annoying.

MINOR UPDATE:

I didn't originally include but I am including it now because I can explain better, It seems like there are some linearity issues with the storylines. (MINOR SPOILER). When you go to the hydroelectric plant, you discover you need to fix the transformer, it's stated that you'll do that tomorrow. Literally didn't get the option to do that until several in game days later. It sort of like skips around, and seemingly time sensitive quests don't seem that time sensitive due to this.

Deacon St John was caught up in these events, and was separated from his wife Sarah after putting her on a rescue chopper as the doodoo was beginning to hit the fan. 

In the years since then Deacon came to believe that Sarah had been killed, and subsequently became rather cold-hearted and hardened in his grief. Getting by as a ruthless bounty-hunter, a chance encounter with the man who helped rescue his wife, whom Deacon had presumed died at the same time, makes him question whether Sarah is alive. 

He sets out to try and find her, but that's not the only part of his past, good or bad, that is resurfacing. It's not just hordes of brutal mutants he must face in pursuit of the truth, but also cannibals, murderous bandits who he may, or may not, have screwed over or killed some of them, and an insane cult that worship the mutants. 

There's plenty of things ready to throw a spanner in the works as Deacon searches for clues as to whether his wife survived.      

'Days Gone' isn't a particularly original game in either its mechanics or its storytelling, but it is fun to play and the narrative is engaging. Just as something unique can still be a load of old arse, this is derivative and yet it is so slickly done that its inspirations pale by comparison.

There's many influences you can pick from it, as it combines the open-world design of Far Cry with a fun way of getting about on your motorbike, added to the visceral action and set-pieces of The Last Of Us. The game offers incredibly snappy 3rd person melee and ranged combat, but also has very decent options for a stealthy approach. 

It's also somewhat of a horror title and manages to be pretty intense even when you have unlocked new combat skills and weaponry. As your character will still get mauled pretty quickly by wild predators, some of which can run almost as fast as your bike goes, or when facing more than a handful of mutants and you know that gunshots might attract even bigger numbers or other predators.

The combination of these factors really makes a lot of difference when you play it on a harder difficulty level, as the experience ramps up through the aggressive nature of the inhuman foes, and the fairly smart behaviours of human enemies. When the game gets into triple digits for the number of enemies onscreen, it can get quite mental, and that is one of its biggest draws.

You will do quests for people and these earn you xp to unlock skills and cash to buy supplies, or maybe unlock certain things such as weapons, or resources. It also allows for crafting your own items, so exploration for the required materials is a necessity, as some things can't be purchased.

Maybe the deserted house you are checking is empty, or maybe its a nest of monsters and you'll get a massive shock as a screaming mob of bloodthirsty mutants pours out. It always takes careful consideration of the environment, as you want to loot these buildings because the challenge throughout is tough, but at the same time sh*t can easily go sideways.

Perhaps you were lining up a headshot just as a creature was about to notice you, and you miss and it screams. And its screams draw the attention of whatever else is in the area, leaving you quickly outnumbered and with no choice but to run and hide.

Your character gets around on a motorbike and the handling is superb, which makes it a pleasure riding around the expansive map. The sensation of speed is good, and it easily could be it's own arcade-y drift-y slide-y racing game, as it controls so well. When you've got a horde of 100 mutants chasing after you, and you're weaving between trees and making mad dashes down the rocky terrain, it is exhilirating.

When you add in the fact that you can run over enemies, and also do shooting whilst riding, it becomes another element that adds to the flavour. Because the game has random encounters you never know what will be around the next corner, so manually driving about (rather than fast-travelling, though it does have it too) never becomes a chore. 

You might be fleeing from a bloodthirsty mob and hear the howl of wolves nearby, then suddenly one of them is running alongside your bike before leaping up to knock you off. Now you're stuck between the wolf and your pursuers, but that's okay because they are just as likely to start fighting instead, and hey! Here's a bunch of roaming human marauders who've now stumbled into it, and they're all attacking each other.
 
As many times as this can be helpful, there's just as many times where someone will shoot at you and the sound will draw the attention of something that's most likely going to savage them and you as well. A bear will make quick work of taking down foes, but it will also soak up precious ammo if you try to take it on. Better to try and get it to do your dirty-work for you, then jump on your bike and peg it away to safety.  

Although it is nothing original or unique as an action game, or for its exploration and resource management, it all comes together for a very enjoyable, dynamic and challenging experience. When this was released on playstation 4 I remember some reviews being dismissive because of the formulaic template that apes Bethesda and Ubisoft design. 

But when you add in humongous crowds of enemies, the slick manner in which you drive around, and the intense combat, you get a title that is much more thrilling than first impressions might suggest. Albeit these elements scale up over time as your character progresses, so I too was somewhat uninterested for a long while until I finally bought it and played it.

Having done so, 60 hours later I'd had a darn good time by the end.

Even the plot is pretty well done, with a no-nonsense approach to the writing and cut-scenes that deliver the meaty drama without dragging on for too long or becoming cringe-y. It's not quite up there with the story-telling of The Last Of Us, but is better than average as it twists and turns through this grim devastated world. Its all backed up by solid performances from the cast.  

If it has a downside, it's the scale of the game. Personally I thoroughly enjoyed it, and the difficulty level I played it on fed into that cycle of exploring for supplies to craft weapons and ammo, and doing quests to get xp, so that I had the necessary skills and weapons when the next intense story set-piece occurred.

It didn't feel samey to me, as there's a variety of mission designs and the randomness of the world means 90% of the time it can descend into utter pant-sh*tt*ng chaos. But I do love games that mix up stealth (especially when it actually, you know, works properly, as this game does), action and scavenging for resources, so 60 hours in this world (on the hard difficulty) was fine with me. I hungrily ate it up. 

Obviously if you don't want 20+ hours (or more) of your time slinging a motorbike about and running over mutants / deer / wolves, or creeping about stabbing mutants in the back, or getting into gunfights with armed bandits, then your appreciation will differ.

For me, I thought it was great and absolutely worth the purchase. It looks decent, is quite impressive when you get to the point that huge numbers of enemies can be onscreen, and the controls / action / stealth are super slick. It certainly isn't original, but is the best version of all those things it is nicking, so I don't much care how familiar the premise or design is.

The end result has that X factor which made me want to keep playing it, and the story was sufficiently engaging to see it all through to the end. Happily it doesn't end on a cliffhanger for a sequel, so whilst it may not get any further entries due to a middling reception (that's not earned IMO), that's not something undermining this.

DG is not a game that will knock you off your feet, but it is a solid and polished title. I have to say that I liked the main story and the side quests, so I would say they are the game’s strong points. I will admit though that the main plot sometimes uses shortcuts and other times it is slightly naive - but not enough to be painful. As a whole it was coherent and interesting enough to keep my attention. 
One thing that I especially liked about DG is how it respected my time inside the game. For example, you instantly get quick travel. Crafting and character development are both clear and to the point. Combat is not overly difficult but satisfying. And it took me a little over 50 hrs to beat the game. All that creates this smooth player experience, which I so much like nowadays, that I do not get to spend as much time playing like I used to.
I also want to mention the protagonist, who is sort of an anti-hero. Not a guy you like instantly - probably the type that you either like unconditionally or simply cannot stand. Either way, Deacon is a well written character with an unobvious background and some demons manifesting from time to time. On one hand, he is a strong character, on the other, just by listening to how he talks, you can tell there is more to him than meets the eye. He is a character that complements the world depicted in the game and, in a way, is a mirror that reflects the state the world is in. Voice actor did a tremendous job.
As for the downsides, I would mention silly AI, or the fact that you only get to unlock the coolest weapons so late in the game that they are no longer viable. I understand you can go for NG+ and keep them, but I am not big on replaying, so it was a wasted potential. Luckily the basic weapons are good enough for comfortable play anyway.

I ride a motorcycle, so the story with a biker theme and riding is a blast.  My PC is a gaming rig, so I can appreciate the amazing graphics and detail the game offers in the beautiful outdoor settings.  

The game does an excellent job of making sure it isn't too easy, but yet isn't frustratingly hard either if you play it realistically (e.g. conserve ammo, and taking care not to play like you're in God Mode).  You can save your progress whenever you like near your motorcycle, so there's no reason to die in a rage because you lost item pickups, or story progress.  

The open world is so amazingly real and detailed, you could be entertained just exploring, but the zombies keep the danger and possible action always there if you get bored.  

My only small complaint, is that the game was ported, and it really should be played with a game controller, because on a keyboard, I'm constantly having to scroll the mouse to see what my character is seeing in quick direction changes.  I don't like the 'over the shoulder' view, and wish you could switch to true first person, but all the other great things about the game made it worth these faults.

I liked it. I did, I got this for a tenner which I think is a complete bargain for what i got. There of course were some issues, but I will start with good.

It's very pretty. And we all like a pretty game. It obviously shines in the forest and snow areas, but it was very nice just riding round on your motorbike through all the various weather, it reminded me of when I use to do it as a kid in GTA San Andreas (only with zombies). 
Exploring in the game was great too. Even wondering round to find all the plants, hordes, nero intel etc felt good. It can be a really stressful or really relaxing game depending on what you're doing.
I really like your BFF in the game, Boozer, type of guy to put a smile on your face. A cutie really.
The bike customisation was good, various paint jobs and decals, wheels, lights etc. Riding it felt comfortable, the fuel consumption was decent as in it didn't drive you crazy having to constantly keep an eye on it, it felt fair. 
Liked all the guns and messing round with em, and you get some nice big ones near the end and even get some guns used by characters, so if there is a character using a gun and you think ""I want that gun"" know that you will end up with it one way or another.
I enjoyed most of the story. Particularly in the first half. Will admit in the latter parts of the game I enjoyed less, the later game seemed kinda rushed compared to great first 25 or so hours. 
Fighting the zombies (well Freaks) is great. Loved the hordes, fun as heck to deal with, nothing quite like accidentally running into a horde and your bike is 200m away and you're low on ammo! Ha it got me a few times.
Lots and LOTS of missions with clearly percentages so you know when a storyline is finished. You ALWAYS have something you can do in this game.
Camp mechanics of earning good rep to get better gear works good too, and with all the zombies n missions you will be doing, it is easy to get them up to max and enjoy all those good upgrades.
It's Starkiller.
The radio broadcast from Copeland always made me laugh and Deacons response to them is great, in fact Deeks response to a lot of things made me laugh. That man is TIRED.
Puppies.
Interesting collectables.

OKay the bad
It did crash a few times in the latter. This is what I mean by I feel like the second half or last third (can't really tell how far along it was story wise. But lets say 30 hours in) felt rushed and not as polished.
The radio communication between you and whoever is broken. The amount of times it would repeat itself, or it would just cut off completely, or 2 people were talking at once, was a lot. If I was getting shot that would make sense to start a line of conversation again, but not I'd just be going about my merry way and it would happen. Conversations that were clearly meant to be have BEFORE you completed a mission also happened. Id be talking about doing something I have JUST done. The radio conversations are honestly a mess.
The story is predictable. It isn't game ending, but it was like ""oh yeah..kind of expected that"" and had the vibes of ""Maybe humans are the real monsters afterall"" in some parts, which is cringe.
Really random moments in conversation would make me go ""someone is just pushing their own private thoughts here"". I can not imagine a man like Deacon saying all the ""bad"" people in the game are ex convicts. But he did. He said that the 7 million criminals in the US, whether in jail or not, are why there are people shooting at innocents in the game. Deek, i don't think a dude with a random cocaine possession is torturing people okay. So there are random moments like that which really took me out of it.
So I guess I could say not consistent writing with that. it for sure felt like there were a few voices being projected. 
Deek often just did not reload. I'd be there tapping it or the mag is out and he is just running round not reloading. It was weird.
The gun wheel would be a pain to navigate. I would pick whatever gun and something else was in the my hand. Really awkward when a Horde of 150 is running down on ya.
The gps would take me routes that I could not drive, across bridges or roads that were blown apart for example. You can just find your own way but still.
Many missions glitched where I couldn't talk to people or untie them etc and I would have to reload the save a few times to get it too work.

I do like the game. I can see why so many want a sequel, I'd be happy with one too. Though I can also see why it doesn't have one (the head guy of making the game I think has ruined it chances by acting quite rudely about people who have played). It'd be great if it does especially with the ending (make sure to 100% all the missions to get it :) )

For the £10 I got it for, very happy. Pick it up on sale I say. If you like zombies, and lots of em! Plus Starkiller, and bikes, then get it. The issues I did bring up CLEARLY weren't enough to get me to stop playing.",1703717576,1703717576,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's hard to bring anything new to the table regarding zombie-type creatures, but Bend Studio very successfully does so with the hordes in this game. It is absolutely terrifying to encounter one of these large groups of wandering Freakers in the wilderness. I'm a jaded gamer, and I've nearly **** myself several times after stumbling into a mob. 

The worst was triggering a loudspeaker when powering up a NERO center that was right next to a hidden horde. Seeing that FLOOD of nightmare fuel streaming into the camp and having to run for my life while shooting, rolling and climbing like mad to avoid a mob of screeching horrors just jumped to the top of my greatest gaming experiences. If my bike had been only a little further away... 

And speaking of the bike, your motorcycle is also great fun to ride and customize and really becomes a full character since it WILL save your life more than once. The story was decent and engaging enough to keep me wanting to find out more.

This game was supposed optimized for console player but it is in fact the opposite. You can only enjoy this game better with mouse and keyboard.
Pros: Nice world building (a bit empty and repetitive). Well everyone else has said all the good things so I won't go further.
Cons: The control is simply st**id, especially for a console player. You're playing as a middle aged man who hurts to move his muscles. The camera angle is the number 1 reason of deaths. The cherry on top? The F****** character takes up about 20% the surface of the screen. You can't see anything when combat many opponents at once.

The gameplay is fun, tho some of the missions are indeed quite repetitive (Either like taking down some group camps, killing hordes, or rescuing hostages) but it was redeemed by some in-game mechanics that make the game addicting to play (I spent like nearly a month simply only play this game alone and almost didn't touch other games because how much the gunplay in this game pulled me back in).

The story is fine, not disappointing but not that spectacular either, but the voice acting is fantastic imo and it's a great thing considering this game is quite long and getting attached to the main character is the key to make people keep playing more, and the voice acting nailed that.

Egregious amounts of forced walking sections puncuated by boring cut scenes filled with sentimental emo dialogue or endless conversations over walkie talkies.

Main story that's twice as long as it should be since it's been padded out with quests such as finding a drunken friend by crouching over beer bottles and holding E, walking behind your wife while she talks about the medicinal uses of lavender then being tasked with finding 3 bits of lavender which are all in a row around 5 metres away from you, finding a dog for someone and finding a rock for a girl that's sad.

You have to hold the action button to pick up/do anything so if you're being chased by freakers and you get to your bike you can't just jump on it and drive away, you have to stand still beside it for a second or 2 holding E before you can get on it. Same with picking up items, you stand beside them then hold E then they disappear and reappear in your inventory.  Tapping the key once isn't immersive or realistic enough, apparently.

You earn skill points throughout the game but the skills you can unlock are minor and something like extra storage space for traps and explosives takes around 7 skill points to unlock which must all be used in the same skill tree so you can't use any of them on ranged or melee attacks, just survival skills, despite seeing numerous things you could use for storage lying around the world.

Enemy types amount to zombies, child zombies, witches from L4D2 (seen 3 in total), hulk zombies (seen 2 in total), wolves, wolves with mange, bears (seen 4 in total), cultists and run of the mill survivors wearing jeans and green or black jackets. So 9 enemy types in an open world game you're meant to play for at least 30 hours. It's about a zombie virus and they could have done anything with it but that's all you get.

There are far too many cutscenes that overstay their welcome and only make the boredom worse, ripping you out of the gameplay. Motorcycles that ride like trash. Higher difficulties make enemies sponges, and remove the hud and fast travel, both of which are already questionable design choices in a game like this. Gunplay is awful and firearms feel weak as hell and don’t even behave realistically. Generic crafting system. Constant QTE’s.

First negative
There is a frame pace/time issue.
I have a 30 series GPU and Ryzen 7 5700x.
I should be on a consistent 16.6 frametime.  It is constantly jumping for 14 to 20 and everything in-between.
The FPS remains constant but the inconsistent frametime is very jarring

Second negative.
It is ""open world"" in a very limited sense.
You can only explore small areas. There is the use of mountains/rocks to block you everywhere else.

Third negative.
The player has very limited jump and climb.  You are only allowed to jump/climb where the game permits.
This means the player is not allowed to make a 1 meter jump in some areas.

It just feels very restricted and un-optimized.

Just been forced into a fight.

I enjoyed the combat more in the early stages of the game, when you're mostly trying to survive and not waste any valuable ammo of your basic guns and the zombies feel like a real danger. Later in the game, you become so powerful that the standard zombies are no real danger any longer and the additional more powerful classes of both zombies and enemy soldiers are just annoying ""I have to hit them 50 times until they die"" types.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

My PC is running an old RX 550 4GB, but it seems to handle it on 1080p low settings, resolution scale 90%. Stays just over 30 FPS this way, which, for a game like this, is good enough for me.

In terms of the actual game: it was highly underrated and overlooked when it came out, so I wasn't expecting an amazing and engaging experience, but it managed to surprise me. Overall: 8.25/10

Pros: Combat feels solid, especially against freakers
         The setting is unique
         A serviceable story, albeit a tad cringe at times
         Traveling on the bike feels good
         The map is the perfect size--not too big or small
         Light RPG elements in terms of upgrading, repairing, cosmetic
         Strong cast of characters
         The HORDES are the high point of the game and there are plenty
         A challenge mode that, when played, gives you buffs and perks in main game
         Long but it's not RDR2 or AC Valhalla. Manageable.

Cons: Open world could have more to do/find
           Story and characters not top notch
           Selection of guns seems weak
           Searching cars becomes repetitive
           Bike damage

Pros: 
Great environment 
Well done Art Design
Good open-world
Crafting system is alright (wish they branched upon it more) 
character upgrades through just exploration 
Cool bike upgrades and design
Game is stable, haven't had any crashes 
JONATHAN ROUMIE is in the game


Cons:
Only dodge mechanic is a roll (no parries especially in melee)
Weapons have to be bought to keep them in your locker
Stealth is a bit basic
No character appearance customization
Story was pretty good; I believed they should have made this a stand alone game instead of setting up for a sequel. I also wished the story allowed for some type of player interaction (like having different endings or changing outcomes throughout the story

The hoards are such a great feature, not many things get your heart going like 1,000 fully animated zomboids storming at you through or over any obstacles; or falling into traps like Lemmings. 

I think the game starts off a bit slow and on first play it lost my interest, but once things open up and you start to know the map, know the towns and locations and get sucked into the open world sandbox where you can get jumped at any moment, its a lot of fun.

I do understand that when this first released, it was very buggy, and that appears to have been the biggest reason for its lack of fan fair; however, all that seems to have been resolved, and the game plays incredibly smooth now. There can still be a rare bug that pops up at times, as there are with every game I have played, but there is nothing that can't be resolved by a quick fast travel or a simple close and restart; there is nothing that is going to break the game or a story line in it. The story is great, the graphics are great, the game play is great. The characters and there stories are deep. I only hope that SONY will realize they misjudged this games potential and likability enough the reconsider a part two.

The game runs great on both Windows and Linux from my experience. It has a few bugs, but they are laughable, minor, and not game breaking at all. The graphics, audio, music composing, writing, suspense, are all awesome. I played on maximum graphics settings on my rig and the game looks sweet. 

I still have a ton of side missions and hordes to clear, so there's another solid 20-40 hours left to play. You could easily put 100 hours into this game, as it gets a lot more fun after you've leveled up your guns and skills.

I have two very minor complaints. The stealth missions, particularly getting into the third camp, can be a bit aggravating. The other is that sometimes missions will crop up and you can't change your loadout, which can be problematic if you're specialized for something like clearing human camps and suddenly have to deal with a horde.

But everything else? Amazing. The controls are super smooth, loadout customization is awesome, the storyline is great from start to finish. For one of the first times in an open world game I'm voluntarily just cruising around instead of using fast travel. The Horde mechanics are great, and firefights or dealing with smaller swarms is a dynamic experience.

For instance, in one of the first camps I came in and cleared out the human enemies. While looking for the bunker, wolves and Freakers started coming in to eat the corpses before spotting each other, turning the post-fight search into a chaotic, glorious mess.

The dynamics of the encounters are great and add a level of strategy on top of simply handling the encounter you rode into. You have to be a bit wary at all times to stay alive, since danger is essentially omnipresent.

I can't believe I slept on this one for so long. I'm ~45 hours in and still haven't completed the storyline and I'm looking forward to 100%ing the game, possibly in Hard mode on New Game+ when I'm done.",1702842391,1702842391,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is lazy AF. You start off by putting wife on heli and then you chase some random dude with motorcycle.  Afterwards two weirdos capture and flame arm of your friend. So you go searching for clean bandage. Level of writing here is akin to what you would expect to see in an MMO, not story driven singleplayer RPG. Story missions are just bunch of boring chores. 

Atmosphere is terribly built. You don't feel any sense of danger. Zombies are weak even on hardest difficulty. World is uninteresting to a point modern procedural generated games offer more interesting worlds. Game has some crafting / looting elements that are built worse than mobile games.

I expected zombies with a little more story, but instead got way more content, depth, and challenge than I thought I would get in this game.  Making the motorcycle the only transportation in post zombie apocalypse is brilliant.  You can move quickly through the world, but never overpowered enough that you can turn your brain off and run everything over.  Challenges of hordes become relative to the equipment you have available, turning the predator/prey play style a little different each time.  The story is not Oscar worthy stuff, but it kept invested enough to play through to the end, and there are multiple story lines to full this open world game pretty well.  

Honestly, I felt like a got a full game and an DLC expansion all in one package.  That aspect makes things a little repetitive towards the end, but those used to the live service experience will get a refreshing surprise here.  

It is not perfect, I encountered some glitches periodically throughout, crashed once or twice.  I feel dealing with encounters had more options I never used, making things more repetitive when I mowed things down with a LMG. Zombies are more powerful than guns, making human encounters oddly easier than melee encounters.  I like to do side quests, but even then I would run out of things to do until a radio call would come in allowing me to progress.  Some random encounters are nice, but most are not needed, and some will break your bike and frustrated me a couple times.

The game's soundtrack is flawless and especially kudos to the vocalists such as Jack Savoretti for the song ""Soldiers Eyes"", Billy Raffoul for ""Hell or High Water"", Lewis Capaldi for ""Days Gone Quiet"", and lastly Zander Reese for ""Yesterday"". The majority of the time, the voice acting is excellent and helps you connect with the game's characters.

It has its high moments, but for every time I enjoyed myself there would be three times where I would find myself frustrated with poor design choices and an abhorrent amount of bugs.

Days Gone is an open world game set in a zombie infested post-apocalypse with survival elements. You ride your motorcycle through a derelict Oregon, doing jobs for various survivor camps while looking for answers regarding your wife’s death.

The game has a decent start, as you will find yourself often underequipped, scavenging for resources to ensure your survival. Enemies, both humans and zombies, pose a significant threat and one wrong move can and will get you killed. That would be about the first 10% of the game. Once you find a rifle accurate enough for you to consistently headshot with and a survivor camp with a reliable supply of ammo there is basically no challenge for the next 70% of the game. 

I played this game on the hardest possible difficulty and I was disappointed with how little opposition was thrown my way. The human enemies, which make for the majority of combat encounters in missions are, simply put, extremely stupid. If you go for a stealth approach you can breathe down their neck without them noticing you, but even if you go in loud, due to the third person perspective, you can just gun them down while being constantly behind cover. Most missions will only put maybe a dozen grunts against you and spread them out in a way where you rarely will fight more than three at once. Towards the end of the game it boosts the numbers a bit and introduces armoured opponents, but, as stated earlier, for most of it you will be shooting helpless lobotomites in their empty heads as they show close to no resistance.

In general, the game holds your hand a lot. As if gunfights weren’t easy enough, you get bullet time so you can perfectly line up headshots. Time freezes when you open your inventory and use items, so even when you do get hit you can heal yourself a dozen times before facing the risk of dying. Melee combat automatically locks onto targets so all you do is spam [Mouse 1] to beat stunlocked opponents to death. Using your sidearm while driving also automatically aims for you so, again, all you do is mindlessly click. There are two things, however, that the highest difficulty setting does well. It removes your hud, which increases the immersion and forces you to estimate or check your stats manually. It also disables fast travel, which leads to more interactions with the open world.

The zombies (called “freakers”) are a lot better than the human enemies, and are the highlight of the game. Their AI is a lot more intricate, there are multiple types of them and they can overwhelm you if you aren’t careful. They are at their full potential in the open world, but in missions, even if you already killed hundreds of them, the game will often underestimate you and throw maybe 10 or so your way and pretend it’s a genuine threat. Considering this was on the highest difficulty, I’m not sure if they even spawn at all on the lower ones.

Other gameplay elements are, for the most part, decent. The gunplay is nice and you get a rather large arsenal to play with. The driving is overall fun, however when you upgrade your speed the slightest collisions will wreck your bike and catapult you across the map, which does get annoying.

The main selling point of the game, that being the hordes, is definitely the best part. The sheer amount of freakers in one group, they way the flow like liquid when they chase you and the sound design around them is all fantastic and it’s something I haven’t seen in another game. Initially just hearing them roaming in the distance sends a chill down your spine and once you arm yourself well enough to take them on, oh man. Days Gone is at its peak when you watch 300 zombies run through a minefield you set up as you mow them down with an LMG. Unfortunately, the game refuses to play its best card and severely underutilizes hordes. By the time they are introduced in the story, nearing its end, I had already hunted down a few in the open world because, frankly, it was more fun than playing the story missions. If they cut out half the braindead goons I had to fight and replaced them with different types of hordes my enjoyment of the game would have been a lot greater.

When it comes to the open world, visually it’s great. However there’s very little substance under that pretty wrap. There’s almost a complete absence of environmental storytelling. All the underfurnished interiors look the same and contain nothing of interest except the same few crafting materials. Not once did I go into a building and think “This is an interesting find, I’m glad I took my time to explore this place.”

The story is a mixed bag. The characters themselves are mostly fine, some are really good but the narrative itself is uncreative and incredibly predictable. The twists failed to surprise me and some were so obvious that otherwise decently written characters seemingly morphed into idiots for a moment for the twists to even occur. There is also one group of characters that is significantly more poorly written than the rest. Avoiding spoilers, basically the first antagonists of the game are a cult whose entire concept and ideology is so ridiculously dumb and unbelievable that I don’t know how the writers thought it was a good idea. It’s like a really edgy 15 year old’s imagining of what a post apocalyptic cult would look like, and I feel like that’s an understatement. 

The worst part of the story by far, however, is the game’s undying dedication to wasting your time. Instead of giving you a cutscene the game will force you to stumble at a snail's pace for minutes to listen to mediocre dialogue, and unlike a cutscene, you can’t skip it. I am not kidding when I say that at some points the game will slow you down to such a crawl that the NPC you are walking with, whose walking speed the devs themselves have decided, will have to wait for you to catch up. It feels like they are taunting you and it’s incredibly frustrating. On top of that there are like a dozen stealth missions where you have to slowly sneak around bushes and listen to long bouts of expositions, and many unnecessary trips that the game makes you take. Cumulatively there are at least a few hours of the game during which nothing at all happens.

Overall, despite my complaints I saw a lot of potential in Days Gone. As you can tell by my playtime I went for full completion because I wanted to see all it had to offer, hoping it would give me something that would convince me to give it a positive review. In fact, it almost accomplished that as the game improved upon a bunch of its shortcomings near the end. There is one flaw though, the most significant one, which prevents me from giving Days Gone a positive score.

This is one of the buggiest games I’ve ever played. I could not go one mission without experiencing some kind of bug. If I was lucky it would just be a visual error, but often I would have to reload saves, reboot the game or verify game files to progress. I had no performance issues and I could find reports of the bugs I experienced elsewhere online so I know it wasn’t a problem on my end. And it wasn’t just a few of the same bugs on repeat, the game genuinely impressed me with the amount of ways it managed to break itself. Texture errors, models not rendering, NPCs not loading or spawning in walls, clipping through the floor, the camera bugging out, dialogue cutting off, crashes when approaching certain locations or starting missions, it goes on and on.

Just maybe I could forgive the lack of attention to detail, uninspired writing and underwhelming difficulty in favour of the well implemented gameplay elements but I cannot recommend someone pays a triple A price for a game that is unable to function properly.",1702606609,1702606609,False,9,4,0.498992890119552612,0,True,False,False

It has a very linear play-through, it definitely should not be tagged as OPEN WORLD.  
It contains the best and worst of storied game play. 
The ability to somewhat do stealth character is enjoyable, and very well received. 
Graphics are at a level to be expected.

Why is “Leaving mission area.” popping up? I’m not on a mission, I haven't picked a mission. I’m just exploring, and now it reloads a save at the beginning of a mission, I didn’t know I was on, GREAT!

Arena boss fights? I know, arena boss fights are a staple in console games, but can we please graduate this concept to “open world”, especially if you want to use that tag. One small example, this boss is one floor above, taunting you, no ladder or stairs. Instead of getting a boost up into an immediate, hop, skip, jump, roll, Mario bro’s button smashing fest, melee fight, why can’t I toss some grenades, maybe some napalm, igniting the house on fire, and leave out the only available entrance, so everyone left inside enjoys their own crematorium, or gets shot upon exiting?

Overall, this is a 50/50 recommend.

I thought the story sucked, but the horde mechanics were enough to keep me entertained, so I kept going. Starting hour 5, the game (which had previously run smoother than butter) started stuttering like hell. I am now ten hours in, and the game is nigh on unplayable. Deacon will take three steps forward, and the game will stutter for half a second. Three more steps forward, another stutter, rinse and repeat. Sometimes, closing the game and turning it back on is enough to make it work, but it will eventually start stuttering again, given enough time. This is a playstation game--it looks good for being a console game, sure, but it shouldn't have this kind of issues on a rig that's like 10 times more powerful than a ps4. Oh, and it's filled with literal spyware, allegedly because the port was outsourced to a Chinese company that makes its money by ""stealing"" data (the game will ask you for your consent on first startup, so it's legalized stealing, but there's no ""don't consent"" option, just one where you give up a little less data. There's a literal keylogger embedded in this game. It's frankly insane that steam is allowing this game to stay on their platform, this is a new low). The funny part is that Days Gone's story is pretty right-leaning and from an American perspective, so Bend studios literally selling customer data to China shows where their real allegiance lies: money, not in any political ideology. So, yeah, skip this one.

Bonus: the zombies in this game could have gotten away with being incredibly generic, since the ""horde"" mechanics are pretty unique and can't really be found in any other gaming franchise besides maybe Dead Rising. Even in Dead Rising, hordes are less an organized mass of zombies moving as one, and more of just a bunch of dead guys standing about. The mechanical flair of this game was already enough to make the zombies unique. Instead, the creative director thought that they needed to be more unique in some other way, so they gave them sound effects that are eerily reminiscent of TLOU's infected. For the visual flair of the ""freakers,"" as the game likes to call them, they decided what could make them stand out from other zombies was a tendency to shit themselves. You read that right. Throughout the game, freaker ""nests"" can be found, structures you have the option of burning to reduce their presence in the area, structures that are made up of twigs and shit. Yeah. Sometimes, if being original means getting literal shit in the mix, it'd really be better to be boring.",1702579718,1702579718,False,0,0,0.495839118957519531,0,True,False,False

The voice acting and dialogue writing is abysmal. It's inconsistent and constructed and never feels natural or authentic.

The crafting is pointless grind. It seems like the game doesn't know what it wants to be, so it's a little bit of everything. They should've stayed with some sort of GTA Lost and Damned with zombies and removed the pointless semi RPG stuff. Things deteriorate way too quickly, forcing you to loot way more than killing zombies or driving your bike.

It's supposed to be open world, but as soon you're locked into a mission, there's now suddenly a route you have to follow and you can't escape it, so if you want to clear a zombie nest while you're there, to open up a fast travel point - you can't, because that is three meters outside mission area.

This game does play a hell of a lot like a movie and a hell of a lot like Red Dead, right down to a focus mode that slows all the action down.  I love survival games with base building etc.   Games like Dayz, Rust, The Long Dark, Green Hell, and Sons of the Forest.   It isn't fair to compare this game to those.   Yes its like being IN a movie.   You aren't yourself, you're somebody else.   I tend to like games that make YOU the actual protagonist.   There is certainly a way to have made this game allow you to customize your character but that's a whole other ball of wax.   They bottom line is that this is like a movie but a really good one.   I admit the story sucked me in.   I presented a penny and I'm in for a pound.   I would still change a lot about it but with the product as it is, I would say its a strong work of entertainment art.   4 out of 5 stars for games in general, 5 stars for this genre.   

I don't like this play style and I didn't like red dead 2 either.   Amazing graphics but very limiting.   A piece of me dies when I am told that I am leaving the quest play area and the character goes black and white.   That means you aren't actually free in the game.   It is open world - sort of.

Go talk to a grave stone for the 3rd time. Follow these guys and listen to their boring conversation for the 3rd time. 
Character's actions making sense? Why should they when everyone can massively over react in anger over the slightest words or actions? For example. EVERY time someone asks Deacon if Boozer is ok, he gets pissed off at them.
Did Deacon want the slave camp to not be QUITE as mean to a little girl with major mental issues? DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO! 
Deacon talks to himself about the smallest things like a psychopath. He's always breathing during these little interjections like he just finished running a marathon. And when he isn't whispering out of breath, he's yelling dialogue for no reason. The ONLY thing that is fun about this game, is the hordes. I'm hoping it gets better, but I really don't see that happening.

Final Edit: This game sucks. If you save the game in the middle of the mission, which it allows you to do, and you load that save, it takes you back to the start of the mission. Wish I hadn't played it so long so I could get a refund. Not worth the $12 I spent. Game is trash.",1702053766,1702394909,False,8,0,0.488826662302017212,0,True,False,False

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Days Gone, developed by Bend Studio, is an absolute triumph in the post-apocalyptic gaming genre. From the moment you step into the worn shoes of Deacon St. John, you are thrust into a visceral and emotionally charged world that demands your attention.

The game's strength lies in its meticulous attention to detail, creating a believable and expansive open-world environment. The Pacific Northwest setting is not just a backdrop; it's a character in itself. The dynamic weather, day-night cycle, and realistic ecosystem contribute to an immersive experience that is nothing short of breathtaking.

The narrative is a rollercoaster of emotions, expertly weaving personal struggles with the chaos of a world overrun by Freakers — the game's version of zombies. Deacon's journey is poignant and filled with unexpected twists, and the character development is top-notch. Sam Witwer's stellar performance as Deacon adds a layer of authenticity to the character that enhances the overall narrative.

The gameplay is where Days Gone truly shines. The motorcycle, your trusty steed in this apocalyptic landscape, is not just a means of transportation but a lifeline. The sense of vulnerability while exploring the vast wilderness is palpable, and the constant threat of Freaker hordes keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Combat is a delicate dance of strategy and survival. Whether you're facing off against human enemies or hordes of Freakers, the variety of weapons and the strategic use of the environment add a layer of complexity that keeps the gameplay engaging throughout.

The game's attention to detail extends to its robust crafting system. Every item you scavenge feels crucial, and the decisions you make about resource allocation can mean the difference between life and death.

Days Gone is not without its flaws. Some technical hiccups were present at launch, but the developers have shown commendable dedication to polishing the game through updates. The vastness of the open world, while impressive, may feel a bit overwhelming for some players.

In conclusion, Days Gone is a masterpiece that deserves a place among the pantheon of great open-world games. Its compelling narrative, breathtaking visuals, and intense gameplay combine to create an experience that will stay with you long after you put down the controller. If you're a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre or simply enjoy a gripping narrative with heart-stopping action, Days Gone is a must-play.",1702344028,1702344028,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

+ Amazing story and interesting twists.
+ Fantastic physics of driving a motobike and shootting.
+ Great craft system. 
+ Horde system very nice maded. Especially when horde trying to surround you from from all corners.

- Was no so big motivation to searching every house, cuz there was only scrap and collectables items. 
If the devs would put a weapon parts instead of scrap, ohh guys, i would spend a tons of hours for exploring every corner.

- Rewards from drop items like ""freaker ears"" and etc is pointless.
- Weak bosses.
 Banshees, Breakers, Reachers are dying by oneshot.

Some wishlist for part 2.

More hp for bosses and interesting mechanics, plus better rewards.
Like for Banshee:
When she scream, she stuns and wanish and calling much bigger horde. Only after killing all horde she will appears again.
For Breaker and Reacher I have no idea. They boring as fck. As for me, bosses must to have some originality and not to be like simple mobs.

This game must to have weapon mods.

The story... It's OK but predictable. [spoiler] Gee, I wonder what the other research the company she was working for was involved in that she was contractually excluded?[/spoiler] It's not bad or anything but not exactly groundbreaking in any aspect.

The voice acting: First off I have to just say it... The VO for the protagonist during actual gameplay is just weird. It's very often completely off from the setting in tone and emotion. Maybe he is supposed to be on meth 'cause he is a biker? Some of the random NPCs you rescue are so bad it they would be funny if the pacing wasn't so off.

Days Gone is an awesomely exhilarating journey through a post-apocalyptic world filled with intense battles against zombies and diverse human communities. I wholeheartedly recommend this game for its gripping action sequences and immersive storytelling. The battles against the undead are a true highlight, delivering heart-pounding moments of survival. However, as a PC player, I did find the control scheme a bit challenging at first, with the camera's sideways perspective requiring constant adjustment with the mouse. Yet, once I hopped on the motorcycle, the controls clicked and I finally got the hang of how to face the motorcycle, and effectively use the game's character movements, though unique, it added depth to hand-to-hand combat. Days Gone is a must-play title for those seeking a thrilling, immersive survival experience. I highly recommend it!

One thing I loved was the bike and even that gets completely ruined because you need to refill it with gasoline like every 1-2km. It made absolutely no sense .. running around with that red canister like a moron every 5 minutes. It really did take all the fun out of the bike. 
Atmosphere is nice and the idea is there, but most characters seemed lifeless and you don't really care about them. And I just can't stand Deek. What a d**khead! I found myself telling him to shut the f* up everytime he started to rant about Copeland and he's radio podcast or what not. He totally broke the immersion when I was clearing out a nest and I was sitting in a bush hiding from runners and Deek starts to scream to Boozer over the radio about some chopper... In fact there was a lot of screaming at random moments over the radio for some reason.
And the zombies ... I disliked that they randomly spawned in areas I just had cleared. Because I played on the hardest difficulty, I found myself stealth killing most of the time, which did get boring quite quickly.
On the positive note - it was really satisfying to get those headshots on charging zombies; and newts were also an interesting idea... Other than that even the zombies seemed a bit too dead for me. 
TL;DR Overall the game felt lifeless and didn't really have anything refreshing or new to keep me interested and coming back.

I've been thinking of getting this game for a long time, I really like the setting and the idea or riding a bike exploring bast landscapes full of zombies.
Seven hours in and the gameplay is a huge bore fest! 
Such a lack of detail, there's nothing interesting to do anywhere, I keep stopping on my way from point A to B as there are some buildings and houses that seem interesting, but it's just empty buildings with no one inside and a bunch of ""rags"" and ""empty beer bottles"", which is pretty much all you need to grab besides bandages. SO boring!! It doesn't even make sense how these scraps are scattered, they just lie around in random places instead of finding them in places which make sense, giving the game more realism and credibility.
Enemies can be zombies (they all look the same and do the same, damage doesn't even feel localised, just shoot or hit them a few times and they're done, always the same) or humans (which are actually too many, enough to overtake all the zombies if they'd want to!) who are fairly fun to fight but again, there's so much to do against them and it gets old super quickly. It also takes away the feel of loneliness and road movie that I was expecting from the game, I think it's a huge mistake to have so many humans in the game, and it's a big cliché in terms of story.
There's no real crafting system, just some very basic molotov and bandage from a quick menu. This is as far as 7 hs, so if it gets more interesting at any point, we have a big problem of pace here..
The Bike upgrades are not really necessary as far as I've played, it just served me to go up and down the road with not much else to do with it. Again, if there's more about it, we have a big pace problem here..
The towns have nothing to do, very basic stuff, give them some bits of monsters and animals you've killed and they'll trust you more. BASIC. BORING.
That's the feeling, everything is developed to a very basic level in terms of game mechanics and content. 
It seems like a game that would appeal to someone focused on the story, as they actually speak quite a lot, but in a zombie apocalypse setting there isn't much to be said that will surprise me, and certainly this game doesn't.
The graphics are good at least for the landscapes, but the buildings inside are uninspired and everything looks the same. Copy paste everywhere, no house looks like someone was living there, or something special was going on or happen in the past.
The characters and zombies all look the same, apart from the ones from the towns who you speak to, but these are counted with one hand. Is the first zombie game I play with such a lack in variety on enemies.
I can't stress how bland and monotone this game feels for me, I wanted to play it for so long, and I pushed myself for 7 hs to see if something develops but this seems like it.
Even if there's a big part of the map to explore for me yet, I honestly feel no interest at all to do so because if in 7 hours playing the game I didn't find anything interesting, I'm pretty sure it won't change much.
One of the biggest disappointments I ever had with videogames, and a huge mystery on why so many people are raving about it.
It's just an big empty map with a few monotone and repetitive things to do.",1702153416,1702153416,False,10,0,0.476356148719787598,0,True,False,False

The sense of accomplishment from clearing swarms and nests is tangible because it actually changes the world, as you remove them travel becomes authentically easier.

I'm sad that there won't be a Days Gone 2 and will keep hopes that one day it gets picked up again. I really want to continue with the story. This is a fun single player immersive story game that has plenty of action, apocalypse theme, and fairly decent story/dialogue. 

It is not a perfect game but I have yet to find a game that is perfect. However this game runs very well for the most part, nothing game breaking, and the graphics look fantastic for the most part.

The game play also feels good in comparison to other similar third person view format. This game has a lot of content for what you pay for. Also highly recommended to play this on controller. Game's like this just feel way better on controller even if the aiming is sacrificed a bit. 

I'm not going to go over all of the minor imperfections but there are cons that stood out to me:

-Repeated voice dialog when exploring the environment, IE you finish a mission and you may have a voice dialog randomly loop again after it was just played a minute ago.

-The random blue question mark mini side missions that are mostly stupid and useless with exception to saving survivors which helps to increase camp reputation and/or credits. Sometimes the question marks just disappear as you reach to your destination and there is literally nothing there or you hear a survivor asking for help but there is no blue question mark that ever appear. 

-Stealth mode is silly in this game. I like the stealth mode a lot but the immersion gets a bit ruined because it feels like everything is blind to you when they clearly should spot you. An example of this is how the bushes provide stealth but they are so low that your character is very visible or you can crouch walk past someone only like a few feet away from you literally looking at you.

This game is for you if:

You like single player story immersion
You like exploring in open world
You like apocalypse themed games especially zombies/viral outbreaks
You like shooting and blowing things up
You like doing missions and building up reputation with NPCs
You like character progression
You like killing marauders and rippers because they are no good murders, rapists, and thieves.
Most importantly You want to role play as Daryl from TWD

I'll start by saying that i'm not a fan of Sony as they are a cancer.
I do have a PS Vita and some emulators. 
I do enjoy some of their games such as Horizon Zero Dawn.
But this game, i can't seem to enjoy it.

I would ask for a refund, but it it past 2 hours, the game is really slow, it is too slowpaced i wanted to like it so i went ahead and played more but in the end, it is not a good game.
Too slow, too limited, uninteresting.
Game is third person only, first person would have been great to have.

Worst is that you have two ""choices"" if you can even call them ""choices, give all of your data to Sony or give partial but still too much data to Sony.
Sony, don't you even dare touch my data or else you'll pay me money for it.
Sony is too many problems, it would take too long to even sumarize it up but anyway, Sony isn't good.

I've shed some tears. Twice. I'd recommend this game at any time. The only downside of it is that I'm now stuck with an awful feeling of emptiness since I just finished the story. I really don't understand the negative reviews. I simply can't say a single bad thing about it over all. I randomly stumbled across it and got it during sale but it is definitely worth the full price. THIS WAS A MASTERPIECE! I'll continue playing until I reach every single objective for sure.

On the surface it seems nice, but just beneath the surface you will see that it's actually lacking in many ways. A lot of missions are repetitive, downright boring, and very on-rails. 

Navigating on the bike and fighting the hordes are the funnest parts of the game, but everything beyond that is just a slog to play through. Freakers are totally uninspired looking. The story absolutely drags and drags and there are some missions that exist merely to pad the game out. Crafting is pretty straightforward, gunplay doesn't feel as good as it should, and the only customization you'll be doing is to your bike. Why the hell does everyone ride a motorcycle in a post-apocalyptic world? Who knows. But it's a big part of the game. While I do enjoy the hordes, they are few and far between, and most of the time freakers and other enemies can be easily cheesed. Days Gone just doesn't feel entirely polished. There is also very little to actually explore and completing objectives around the map will feel copy and pasted over and over again. There's just no substance to this game.

I have to say there are a lot of good open-world zombie games out there and I wouldn't even rank this in my top 5. Dead Rising, Dying Light, Dead Island, 7 Days to Die, Project Zomboid, State of Decay.... all better games in my opinion.",1694403893,1701745207,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros.
- Decent zombie game
- Craft system (small but is there)
- Bike upgrade system
- Open world after first few quests
- Enjoying story after intro (intro was cut scene after cut scene without much playing)

Cons
- Craft system not the largest
- Playing 8 hours and still got starter weps
- Weps you pickup in the world you can't keep only the ones you buy.... So take out a sniper with stealth? Take his gun? It's yours but can't put it in your locker until you buy your own sniper. Seems a bit pointless

At times the game had really low lows making me almost quit, but it was worth sticking through. 

Good stuff(*Minor remarks):
The first time I saw *one* [spoiler]horde[/spoiler] at night kinda made me scared and drive my ass outta there, impressed me a lot!
The bike handling, even more so after installing a faster bike mod (Its kinda slow on base speed ngl)
Skill tree, basically all skills felt like you really want them and they really do improve your situation by a ton.
*Some skills felt like they took away from the base game and if you didn't have them stuff felt unusable. 
(For example: Melee damage is abhorrent without skills on Survival, I think bad weapons just break before they kill one Freaker if you don't have one dmg increasing skill yet)
Everything on Survival is kinda balanced by still having some sort of one shot mechanic forcing you to use all your tools.
*Not sure I was a fan of having to shoot a normal guy with a shirt 6 times (non head shots) despite this though.
Silly little Tasks strewn all over the Map make it feel alive. 
*At times this still feels repetitive though, because a lot of the time they're carbon copies of each other.
Little talks after missions make it seem more realistic and conversations with random vendors.
The survivor sense showing the mini map for a few seconds is a clever solution to not having a UI (Survival difficulty)
Story (Very eventful and long)
I very much liked the climax and [spoiler] hordes [/spoiler] peak though, was very fun!
You actually felt like you got stronger throughout the entire game.
Game length, 36 hours while doing a moderate amount of side jobs.

Meh Stuff:
Story (Kinda predictable stuff)
The emotions in cut scenes feel dated despite this game being from 2019.
Deacon kinda felt too angry at random stuff in the world for me but might just be a me thing.
Not enough enemy variety.
Repetitiveness of stuff after a while (for example opening the 500th car trunk or doing the 500th bounty mission that involves you driving into the camp, driving to the location, driving back to the camp)
Sometimes saves are really weird because they don't consider enemies, so you could just be farmed on save load by a pack of enemies.

Mods I used:
Faster bike (Survival without Fast travel made the travel a slog IMO)
Instant car trunk opening (This gets old real quick)
Lighting mod (Who doesn't want a prettier game)

The story is weirdly paced, especially towards the end, with some fairly predictable twists. Was surprised at how well written, although underdeveloped, even some side characters are. Boozer is a legend. The random radio calls you get will randomly interrupt other dialogue while out and about. The same character will also radio in multiple times consecutively which can make some exchanges awkward. Not much variety in mission design.

The combat is decent - it is good enough. Was not impressed with the melee combat. A good bit of variety in ranged weapons although they take a long time to unlock. Fighting humans feels good as they use cover but combat vs zombies is where the cracks start to show. Zombies pretty much run at you in a straight line. This can be a pain in the ass especialy vs hordes in the early game. The bandaid solution was to create the ""focus"" system allowing you to slow down time - Not great. It doesn't solve the problem and adds a system I pretty much didn't use. Later on you get more powerful tools to deal with hordes which mostly solves this issue. You are given a lot of freedom in how you approach encounters. Can set traps and use stealth.

Crafting, exploring and gathering is great, and is mostly what makes the game fun, but having limited space for crafting materials is infuriating. Running out of molotovs and not being able to craft more because you couldn't pick up the hundreds of kerosene bottles you found earlier is stupid. At least give me upgrades in the skill tree to increase the inv. space. The skill tree is pretty basic, but the abilities all seem useful. Was a bit disappointed with how linear the bike upgrades are. The bike is such a big part of the game and you basically just upgrade the engine etc. to increase some stats. Cool that all upgrades are visual tho. Ramming zombies and animals with your bike straight up feels like hitting a brick wall. Bike combat is also ass. Seems weird that they overlooked this since the bike is so key to the core experience.

There are multiple ""main villains"" and even though the game is insanely long, they all seem to be killed off fairly quickly and the ""boss fights"" are basically just melee sequences and a cutscene where they die. Felt a bit rushed.",1688002073,1701626902,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately, the further I progressed, the more boring and annoying the game became. I am disappointed.

Pros:
* Story and characters.
* Graphics.
* Music and sounds.

Cons:
* Hours of riding a bike - boring. Random encounters with zombies, wolves, snipers etc. - frustrating. I don't want that Ubisoft-style randomly generated 50 hour chewing gum, I want a decent 8-16 hour story. This is not gameplay, this is garbage play and should be considered illegal :)
* Mandatory stealth missions where you are not allowed to kill anyone because either NERO guys have bulletproof socks or just because the game tells you not to. This is lazy game design and lazy story telling, this is not some Deus Ex or Dishonored where there are actually reasons to play non-lethal.
* When you start the game, you see a message, something like ""gamepad is recommended for best experience"". The reason for this is that mouse is being emulated. Sometimes it becomes unresponsive, sometimes it just works incorrectly. If you hope you can speed run the boring parts because you play on KBM and will just headshot all enemies, then forget about it because your accuracy in this game depends on how long you press the RMB for and on auto-aim within your crosshair rather than on your reflexes.
* Missions. Every time someone calls you on the radio, he/she cannot just give you a briefing, instead, you are being asked to come over, so you ride to A, get mission details, ride to B then ride back to A or ride to C to get a new mission. If you want to fast travel - destroy zombie nests (who in the world would want to waste time on that?), and even if you do so, if you run out of gas, you will not be able to use fast travel, you will need to walk - this is so exciting. Moreover, the missions themselves are boring, just ""ride there and kill the bad guys"".
* And finally, Rikki and Addy are lesbians and Addy is fat. 1. You simply cannot be fat in a post-apocalypse world (neither can you be buff like Boozer). 2. Does the fact that they are lesbians add value to the story? No. Then why is it there? Because wokeness. Then dislike.",1701512038,1701512208,False,1,2,0.429664015769958496,0,True,False,False

I was hoping this mess would end around the 25 hours mark of my playthrough but it dragged on for almost another 15... The quality of the writing was poor, but it still managed to take a nosedive once I reached the southern part of the map. The scenario is full of clichés, you can see many plot points coming from miles away and the whole thing drags on forever: [spoiler]of course that one government guy you see in the opening cutscene is alive, of course he helps you find your wife, of course she's alive, of course the shady asshole you expect to stab you in the back ends up doing so, of course he gets away and comes back to bite you in the ass later in the story, of course the leader of the evil faction knows you from times before the world ended and has a score to settle, of course the company your wife worked for was actually evil and of course the entire apocalypse was caused by research done in a secret lab in bumfuck nowhere in the middle of Oregon, right down the road where you live.[/spoiler]

The technical state of the game isn't great either.
The game can look really good at times but it comes at the cost of so much jank. Characters will look gorgeous in cutscenes thanks to motion capture, only to look at you with dead eyes and barely any sort of lips sync when giving you secondary jobs during actual gameplay. The hordes are impressive to look at, especially since they had to run on PS4 originally, but the zombies often won't play any death animation or get any sort of ragdoll when killed in large numbers at a time and will simply float in the air after dying. I also encountered a fair amount of objects who refused to load and I was stuck with their low LOD version. The last mission bugged at the end and the ground wouldn't load, forcing me to restart the game. Given that the game came out in 2019 and was then ported to PC in 2021, it's a shame to see such a lack of polish.

The rest of the game is ""fine"".
The open world is pretty standard and filled with the expected checklist of things to do. Combat is fine, even if the AI can be pretty abysmal especially when sneaking around. The bike is annoying to maintain for most of the game and will require constant refuel and repair until you get some upgrades. The hordes don't really bring interesting gameplay, you simply kite them around while throwing every piece of explosive you have until no zombies are left standing.


tl;dr Janky AA game marketed and sold as a AAA, should've focused on more than pretty graphics, I hope the studio got rid of their writers.

It's a mediocre game if you haven't played many games before. It's a bad game if you've played TLOU 1 and RDR 2. This game is not a hidden gem, and it was not released 'a couple of years' too late. No wonder there will be no sequel. 

REVIEW:

+ Good graphics
+ Good optimization
+ Good horde fights (tried them in challenges)
+ Some late-game elements like horde fights are okay

- The 'beginning of the apocalypse' part of this game (first cutscene) was clearly inspired by TLOU 1, and it is terrible, to say the least.
- An uninspired story that feels as if it was copied from other games
- Boring characters (inferior versions of Naughty Dog characters)
- Motorcycle gameplay (if you didn't like horses in RDR2, then try this game—it will teach you to love horse gameplay in RDR).
- Resource 'scarcity'-based gameplay, similar to TLOU, yet much worse: very hard to save ammo when zombies keep shaking their heads. Devs tried to fix it by implementing a slow-mo mechanic.
- Terrible melee combat: if you didn't manage to find an axe or machete, then good luck fighting 'melee attack sponges.'
- The world feels like a copy from RDR2, but it is nowhere near as good: in RDR2, cities were densely populated with people and activities, whereas the wilderness stayed empty for a reason. Here, if you go to the wild, you will end up seeing one zombie after another, just like in more populated locations—it feels like traveling through suburbs, not dense forests.
- The quest structure is an out-of-season April Fools' joke.
- The first part of the game is supposed to feel like you are underpowered. The problem is it sucks due to poor gameplay, an uninspired story, and boring characters. Challenges allowed me to check the 'late/end' game that is horde fights, and they are okay (but just okay).
- Dialogues are worse than in Fallout 4.
- Terrible UI and save system

1259420,152603651,76561198071513197,0,1,21,0,21,1701032306,"I'm writing this as a form of appreciation for the Days Gone game. I played on PS and it's been a while now - over 2 years since completion. The thing is, I expected a lot and got even more. I bought a Steam version just to place this review. Also I got a physical version, despite the fact that I had the digital version on PS, so it can just stand on my shelf and shine.
It had been 910 Days Gone when I got my first PS platinum. Now I have 2 - I just don't play for the achievements, so in my case accidental platinum really means something. Even when I completed the main story and all side quests and maxed everything there is, this world still calls to me, tells its own story on every corner, every empty building and desolated outpost. I really wanted to capture it all.

My gaming background is significant, and my Steam history doesn't show it all. The reason is, I bought a lot of Steam games after playing them before, just to have them in the library, hoping to play them again sometime and get myself back to better times, but this never happens with so many chores and duties to do.

I've been a father in search of a child, soaking wet from the Heavy Rain.
I've Became Human with Kara and Marcus.
I just couldn't die, feeling Payne to the Max.
I sent a terminal patient To the Moon.
I was lurking and practiced Thievery in the Deadly Shadows.
I was Dishonored and got my honor back on Dunwall streets.
I barely survived the nightmare of USG Ishimura and Dead Space.
I was the lone survivor of Von Braun, stopping Shodan AI from making the world into its own image.
I was Andrew Ryan's puppet in the underbelly of Rapture city, bearing the whole ocean on my shoulders.
I reached Seattle with Ellie and found a purpose, whereas I had none before.
I personally witnessed how Strange Life can be.

These were some of my best titles. They left me so emotionally wrecked (in a beautiful way) and I still didn't write any review before; in fact I never did such a thing before. I wish the non existing Looking Glass Studios, makers of Thief with which I spent endless hours, got such appreciation from me, but this cannot happen anymore. I don't want to make this mistake again.

I play games for the stories, just as I read books or watch movies. There were quite a lot of them, but not all obviously left a scar. And now Days Gone, the open world game achieved that. At some point, when playing, I simply knew that nothing can break the impression made. Bend - I want to let you hear that out loud: your game (and open world games aren't usually the best in terms of telling stories) got under my skin and I didn't expect it at all. I just sometimes play OWGs as a form of escapism and your achievement kept me where I was, nailed me to the ground and it was good.

Why is that? The story has its ups and downs, it's a bit naive sometimes but still accomplishes the same what Life is Strange did for me. How Days Gone, sharing all the open world games flaws such as repeatability and bit of grind; this very same game, when it comes to the storytelling, pushes the right buttons, hits me against the wall few times, exploits me emotionally (again, in the best possible way) and stays with me after turning the console off. I'm still there, in the postapocalyptic Oregon, an empty world where almost every person is dead and those who aren't either live to survive or walk in hordes, covered in filth, sometimes wearing a wristwatch or humming songs their human self remembers. Why I cannot get back from where no hope can be found to my real life - not free from quite huge struggles - but in the end to a normal life which all of Days Gone survivors will not ever have anymore?
When I finally had put all the puzzles together, I was awestruck with the answer. It was something new to me, never felt in a game story before.

There is important stuff that adds to the story and creates the background for it. The overall ugliness of the Freakers pandemic world is beautifully balanced by nature taking the world back, weather effects, day-night cycle, rain, fog, sunrays, those little things that just sum up. They cost a lot of development effort and reveal the love put into the development - nature is simply beautiful. But that's not it.
There's also a huge amount of reminders of the world never to be the same - all the flyers, cars and things that tell little stories (like a body pinned to the wall by the car, luggage left alone ready to put inside the trunk or bloody writing on the van saying 'we went north'). There's a multitude of different environments (I just missed the big city, a place that feels like downtown): the factories, the legendary sawmill, storages, shops or houses in which you wouldn't tell, if not for the dust and trash, if they had been left 2 years or 2 days ago. This is so admirable and simply true. But this is also not it.
All open world designers compete about the amount of details, but it's not ok when the details are the purpose themselves - we are always excited about them in the trailers and during our first hours with the title and we somehow seem to forget what the games are truly for, focusing on technological achievement like it was everything. The details and attachment to the credibility of the world created is important but it's nothing without experience. Such features should only be a way to tell something more and Bend has shown how it should be done and I will repeat this to everyone: the details level tells a big amount of side stories and adds up to the main story, defining a believable world. But that's also not it..
The main story. It's great but not unique, it's not never-seen-before, however the storytelling (flashbacks and I Remember storyline!) makes it even greater. Deacon losing hope, finding it again, helping Boozer and leaving Lost Lake (I just couldn't do it easily, I rode for 2 real evenings on the north before I was ready to leave for the south) and finally Deacon finding his loved one - this is this one candle light in the mad and pointless world. But.. it's still not it.

For me what makes this experience unique is connecting all these ingredients and spicing it with something I would not think adds value, while it actually becomes cherry at the top. Devs have taken advantage of the open world games features that are usually tedious and made grinding a valuable feature. I believe it's one shot and won't be repeated for many years, however I hope I'm wrong. Why? Because it's magic. Maybe it was design purpose or maybe accidental, but for me, all this tediousness, all these tasks that Deacons burdens himself with: to bounty hunt, to burn nests, to destroy in general, all this cruising empty world is not for nothing. It's not about getting achievements and having them ticked off. It's about getting in Deacon's skin, it's about feeling an everyday empty hopeless routine, which nicely parallels my everyday, often pointless, routine. Even discovering the tourism flyers or nature viewpoint collectibles stresses the void of the new world and loss of the old one, emphasizes what Deacon's life has become when he tries to just reconcile with the fact that all is lost and at some point it makes him change, ultimately to the point when he discovers people in the freakers again.
It's been 180 Days Gone passed in-game and 910 total but I feel every one of these 730 before the story starts and this is what makes Deacon's story sound really loud. I wish to believe it was by design, not accidental. I can't imagine the other reason for putting the Days Gone counter on the game title page.

Deacon's and Sarah's story is now part of me, part of my flesh and soul and Days Gone is one of my big time titles and I wish to thank Bend for that. When I think of it, I just wish I hadn't missed the Proposal PS4 Theme that was available once before Day 731. I never knew about it and know, if I could have it enabled on my PS4 I would never ever change it. Unfortunately, it is long Gone.",1701376657,1701417480,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm about 15 hours in the game and I can count a dozen instances of going to an area and doing a side bounty or tackling a nest-clearing objective and suddenly I'm thrown into an emersion-breaking cutscene that ruins the firefight, pulls me to a different location, and sometimes even changes the time of day.

In the same location up north this happened TWICE... once forcing me to stop clearing nests so I could follow a helicopter for a story mission, then when I returned there was an event where a mob of zombies were chasing someone needing help.  I get out a distractor and prepare to engage when... nope, cutscene, day changes, I'm moved to the other side of the bridge and that event is now gone.  What moron thought this would be a good idea?

I have other gripes like binding the same control to dropping gas cans the same as jumping off of ledges (I've jumped off a bridge after filling my motorcycle's gas tank a few times already because the game prioritizes movement over dropping the item, even when the control is held) and stuff like the game forcing itself to pause if you Alt+Tab out during a lengthy, unskippable cutscene, but the forced cutscenes that break immersion are ridiculous and completely turns me off of the game.

Pros
- Great map and good graphics. It doesn't look much like I remember that part of the world looking, but the map is very well thought out and the scenery is beautiful. Character models were more variable though. Sometimes they looked good, sometimes not.
- Fun gun play - snappy, responsive shooting - and good motorcycle action once you get a few upgrades. The bike is a little slow to start and fuel esp. sucks - you have to refuel about every mile - but it works as a mechanic, forcing you to think about your route.
- Hordes are a great system - Getting chased down a railway track by a couple of hundred screaming, hungry zombies out for your blood never gets old. I often took a manual save and played them out a few times, trying different tactics.
- The story's a slow burner but pretty good. It's very low key - the fate of the world's not at stake, you're just trying to survive and figure out what happened to your wife. Think KCD rather than.... your average fantasy rpg. The rippers were a bit silly and militia bits variable but overall v good.
- Decent characters. Deacon occasionally veers towards yippkiyaye posturing but I thought, for the most part, he was well written and reasonably acted. I think people are so used to Mary Sue PCs who turn out to be the ""chosen one"" somehow destined to save the world that they struggle with playing a guy who's an average joe just trying to get by in a world gone to hell.

Cons
- The game's pacing is off; I was initially relieved not to be bombarded by quests but as time went by it felt like you're waiting for quests far too long. Reddit's advice is to ""ride around for twenty minutes."" I don't want to ride round aimlessly for 20 minutes in a video game.
- When they do call, they (esp Tucker) love to send you in circles. You'll be somewhere, she'll call you in for a job, then send you... right back where you were. Then demand you go back and turn in, before you ride round randomly waiting for another call, and she calls you back to camp for another job. Which is... yeah, you guessed it. Right where you were. It's a bad system. I hate fast travel but here it felt essential for sanity.
- Far too many story quests involve massive amounts of forced slow walking - and I mean old lady slow - behind characters dropping exposition, while your weps are locked and the game makes you occasionally mash a random key to do something.... pointless. Or, worse, use the crap witcher vision. It's not quite RDR2 but it's infuriating. When will devs learn this just isn't fun?
- The crafting system is shallow and you have almost no inventory space. 95% of the time, you're full up, which means that 95% of stuff you might loot, you can't. It's just bad design; there's all these cabins / mines / logging camps etc but there's absolutely no point exploring them because there's *nothing* you can actually loot. 
- The first 60% up north is much better than the stuff in the south, and the final main mission was a let down - massively overscripted, lots of forced slow walking, bullet sponge enemies, dumb shit where the MC casually strolls into obvious ambushes and possibly the worst ""boss"" fight I've seen in the last decade.

Overall, I got a lot of hours of enjoyment out of it -  - probably 70 hours of actual play to 100% it, incl. the epilogue - and the positives outweighed the benefits. On sale, it's a steal. There were just times when it frustrated me and, having finished the story, I'm not sure I'd want to play through all the story missions again. 

I encountered a few bugs / glitches  - blue question marks esp - but nothing major. Main issue was that some of the missions - esp. the ones using the witcher vision thing - were really janky but reloading would usually make the thing show up.",1701278708,1701278795,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Gameplay: the gameplay is extremely fun, i love riding the bike around exploring and finding things, there really isn’t much to do outside of the story other than occasionally loot buildings and kill the infected in there but it still has great gameplay due to the fact the story is continuously going on and updating while ur playing.

The Good: Geeat story, fun to clear marauder camps and hordes, enticing gameplay but sometimes annoying… I love facing the hordes myself and having the joy of doing nero check points and little activities in between the story missions.

The “Bad”: there isn’t really anything bad with the game other than a few glitches that won’t get patched like when u get to the camp near the end of the game it makes u slow ride ur bike like u have no gas, but u fix it by exiting to main menu then come back in and that’s the only glitch.

To conclude my review, I give this game a positive one. It’s  easily a 9.5/10 with the .5 excluded due to some repetitive gameplay, I have no doubt in my mind this game is one of sonys best story games available, a lot of people still hate it but I personally think it’s great.

However, being a PlayStation exclusive, I decided to give it a shot. Regrettably, my initial apprehension proved to be accurate.

Admittedly, my playtime was limited to around two hours, so I can't provide an exhaustive critique. The game isn't obviously terrible, but I struggled to identify anything uniquely enjoyable about it. Essentially, it's a third-person shooter with a zombie theme, and the mechanics come across as average. As a 24-year-old, I've grown weary of the zombie theme that has pervaded movies and games throughout my life.

I've come to realize that for a zombie game to captivate me, it needs to offer innovative gameplay mechanics, as seen in titles like Dying Light, or boast a compelling narrative akin to The Last of Us. Unfortunately, after investing two hours, I strongly sensed that both the gameplay and mechanics wouldn't surpass mediocrity.

Zombie Apocalypse, ends times, certainly not new, almost thought i was sick of it but Days gone is an exception. Its strength lies in a strong focus on story/narrative and world building supported by solid game mechanics and stunning visuals.

The story might rub some gamers the wrong way, its against the current times of franchises/spin offs, references, nostalgia and general cynicism. It owns it theme but its very much about the characters. Its full of heart and sincerity, exploring classic themes of love and loss, grief and hope, of that were are fucked without each other. Sam Whitwer did an amazing job voice acting, as did much of the cast. The interactions between the characters felt organic and evolving. Also i quite liked their take on zombies and enjoyed the sinister shadow government overtones. The little touches/interactions with the npcs and how the respond to Deacon do wonders for reinforcing the themes of the game. Going to a camp the first few times its like ""open up its that drifter"" ""Someones coming"" but after you have trust its ""quick open up its Deacon"" ""Hey Deacon"". Its basic stuff but it all comes together to create a sense of building connections and community. Deacon has genuine little conversations with all the vendors, more that one! He knows there names, they warm up to each other, through tone, conversation/interaction, its great. 

Days gone is not breaking any boundaries or bringing any amazing new mechanic to the table. The game is story focused and the systems and mechanics function perfectly in support of this.  Crafting, Stat upgrades, bike upgrading is simple, adds just enough depth and sense of progression/empowerment and is often part of the narrative. Gunplay and mele is again the same, simple, responsive and feels pretty crunchy.  Stealth is the only mechanic that i think is a bit under done/utilised, its almost too simple and effective but again it works and doesnt get in the way at the least.

Both the human and infected AI isnt terrible, average honestly but i found the humans fairly good at flanking and taking cover, the infected variations posed a real threat at times, esp the infected animals and hordes - which i have to say they did do a pretty standout job on. Side activities are somewhat repetitive, clearing areas, bounties - but Deacons particular set of skills is apparent and recognised in the story, it makes sense hes making the areas safer, he is not a farmer or civil engineer unlike most zombie apocalypse games. Random encounters were actually a little bit fun, other than the npcs talking too much/loudly, which the games anticipates and shortens all random encounter npc interactions at a certain point, genus! Some encounters can be annoying but in a good kind of way and nothing motivates me to kill like being clotheslined off my bike by vagrants. 

Days gone is like a classic example of good engineering, everything is solid and it functions well. Nothing seems to be design for design sake, its all simple effective and with just a dash of flair to make it their own.

I had to talk about the bike separate from the rest of the mechanics, oh my gosh that bike. Riding in Days gone is like web swinging in The new spider-man games, id fast travel but honestly i dont want to. Riding it is a dream, it feels great to control, sounds so good and i could ride those beautiful mountain passes all day, satisfying is the best description.  Its not just a mode of transport, its your save spot, something to care for, to work on, its an extension of Deacon.  

Visually its breathtaking, bar maybe some of the npcs being legitimately more creepy than the infected but still really minor, everything else i really cant fault and that Deacon (Sam Witwer) is a handsome mother fucker even dressed like a hobo. Weather/fog is stunning.  I very rarely take screenshots in games, i do with this. Sound effects, music etc, its all top quality work - from the sounds of the forests, Infected screams, distant gunfire pops or soothing guitar rhythms its all so good.  

On top of that you get Challenges, new game+ and can reset enemy camps/hordes/nest after completing them. Oh Did i mention that it runs really well without a reliance on frame generation AI. Who knew. I play on HDR and often get my retinas blasted by the menus in HDR games, Days gone has a HDR menus brightness slider, you beautiful barstards. When you go to the visual settings in game, of which are well represented - it goes back to clear background so you can see your changes in real time, showing you metrics at the top right of the screen - gpu/cpu usage, fps. I mean even its settings are awesome, what devilry is this. 

Days gone blew me away, i didnt think this kind of design philosophy even really existed in the gaming industry anymore. Its not the best game ever but the total sum of its parts makes it in my opinion a fantastic example of this medium, why i play games really. Amazing what a creative, focused and resolute team can achieve.

Now with the Autumn Sale, I decided to give this game another shot and played it on my PC with a controller. And I gotta say the game was still bad. Combat felt unrewarding, the story was so un-immersive just because after a cut scene there will always be a black screen that lasts for about 5 seconds then goes back into normal gameplay. This ruined the story for me. Why not have seamless transitions like every other game?

I personally think the game is just not for me and the story is ok, but then again I refunded the game and got No Mans Sky instead...

While the game offers moments of gripping intensity and a visually impressive setting, it falls short of reaching its full potential.

One of the game's strengths lies in its narrative. Protagonist Deacon St. John's personal journey in this harsh world is compelling, and the character development adds depth to the overall experience. The dynamic weather and day-night cycle contribute to the immersive atmosphere, creating a world that feels both haunting and alive.

The core gameplay mechanics, centered around motorcycle traversal and combat against zombie-like Freakers, are solid. The motorbike serves as a crucial tool for exploration and survival, and the tension of facing large hordes of Freakers is undeniably exhilarating. The game's weapon customization system also provides a degree of strategic depth.

However, Days Gone stumbles in certain areas. The pacing can feel uneven, with a slow start that might deter some players. The open-world design, while expansive, occasionally lacks the depth found in other titles in the genre. Technical issues and occasional bugs, especially at launch, also hinder the overall polish of the game.

Days Gone, despite its flaws, offers a decent experience for fans of post-apocalyptic settings and survival gameplay. While it doesn't quite reach the heights of other titles in the genre, those seeking a story-driven adventure with intense moments and a vast, atmospheric world may find enough here to make the journey worthwhile.",1701106639,1701106639,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Both games are almost like movies.  Like movies, whether you like the drama or not will determine whether you like the game or not, unless you just do not care about drama and only care about video game play.  I like both, and the combat system still holds my interest when the story is known and is no longer very compelling.  Basically, if you liked ""The Last of Us"" I think you will like Days Gone, too.

Advice:  Play the game at the easiest setting.  This is plenty challenging, even once you get experienced at it, if you also make it a rule to start the game over if you die.   That is right, no saves.  If you die, start over.  You would be amazed how much more immersive this makes the game world.   Next, if you play this using mouse and keyboard, spend a lot of time changing the keybinds so that you can do what you need to do with one hand on the keyboard, and one hand on your mouse, without looking at the keys.  It is not easy to find the right settings that will work best for you, so experiment until you can do a reasonable job of controlling  Deacon by ""touch typing"" like a good typist.  It takes a lot of practice, but being able to control your character is what the game is about.

Pros:
-great acting all around. The performances are universally great and its nice to hear a new Sam Witwer protagonist after Force Unleashed's Starkiller. He himself also wonderfully plays Deacon St. John at the line of madness. Unlike some other Sony protagonists who talk to themselves in a very straightforward fashion to tell the player what to do, Deacon rants angrily at himself, vulgarly curses those he kills, and generally thinks those around him are bullshit. Those around him are performed very admirably--even if their characters aren't well defined if at all, they remained memorable.
-looks good. not a graphical showcase but solid nonetheless, especially as the framerate stays rocksteady at 60 when a horde of dozens is on screen. I feel like the ""average game look"" is definitely is definitely this game: solid elements of photo-realism, a newish idea of the zombie look (this time less decayed and gross and more vampiric and feral), and plenty of world variety.
-driving model/physics and mechanics. your bike actually feels like a 400 pound bicycle, being both maneuverable but weighty, Deacon needs to carry parts on hand to fix it, and actually needs to shift his weight to minimize damage from (frequent) jumps and drops. travelling is dangerous and random; refuel stops and wrecked cars are often ambush points for enemy scavengers, wolves can keep up with the slowest of bikes, wires strung along the road and snipers hiding in the trees may unseat you from your bike, and tunnels require you to physically move cars aside to make a path. pretty much the only things that would make it better are more customization parts, a manual transmission (driving a manual car IRL makes me seek it out in gaming), and a deeper repair system requiring specific parts for engine failure, muffler damage, fluid leaks, etc, and more variety in ambushes.
-bug free, rock solid performance. It weird to have to say a great port is a pro for a game, but here we are. i noticed no hitching, dips, poorly timed frames, etc. Runs without pop in or freezing on an HDD.
-brilliant world size. This is definitely one of the hardest things to do in open world games, and this game is a perfect showcase for it. travelling from one side of the map emulates the feeling of an hours long journey without actually being that annoyingly long. environments feel realistically big while again, not being _that big._  your bike's gas tanks are perfectly suited to the escalation of the work--you start with only enough to need to refuel at _every station_ before you can travel between camps without refuelling, then eventually you can go across a third of the map without worry.

the mids
-story. at times, Deacon's personal journey is brilliant, especially when he's interacting with the NERO and Sarah storylines. Giving the player an emotional hook such as the death/possible survival of Sarah is a brilliant way to get the player invested. When people say this story is ""excellent"", they are referring to these two storylines. However, those particular storylines are undercut by the occasional vibe that you're being strung along and story bloat. In fact the story in general suffers from major bloat, not that its all bad. A great example is the Lost Lake storyline, which is not only undercut by an entirely unexplained history between the main character and said camp, it also introduces a plan to cut off the horde and then doesn't capitalize on it for literally _HOURS_, in part thanks to non-linear design. but mostly thanks the five+ unrelated missions inbetween. again, not that its all bad, since those inbetween missions deal with an interesting contentious relationship and realistic solutions to problems, The entire third act is way too drawn out with new settlements when you're probably not done with earlier ones. Takes 15ish hours at least to get into actual interesting story.
-gameplay. fighting the horde is great. however, fighting humans is boring and uninspired, feeling like The Last of Us but so far behind in terms of refinement. Skill point acquisition is simply too slow. Gaining camp trust takes too long. not enough bike customization (i wish it were more like Mad Max, letting you choose between like harley chassis, Kawasaki/yamaha/suzuki chassis, ducati chassic, dirt bike chassic, etc, not to mention lack of visual changes). nothing to do besides kill things.
-lore and themes. world is brilliant, but camps feel underdeveloped. you hardly spend anytime with the first two and all of them save the work camp lack identity, politics, etc. some Leaders raise interesting questions within a post apocalyptic world, have interesting political leanings, and moral beliefs but fail to explore them deeply. Deacon's own motorcycle club influenced morality is intriguing but suffers from a lack of definition and again, exploration. By the end of the game, you will still know _nothing_ about his old club aside from who was in it and who was allied and enemies with it. 
-dynamicism--this game relies on ""encounters"" (marked by little blue questionmarks) to source variety. following these leads to ambushes, survivors in varying states of being overrun or executed by rippers, or supplies. the problem is they have an overwhelming feeling of being spawned in around you--theres nothing natural or immersive about how you engage with these encounters.

cons
-audio glitches, overlapping conversations
-really bad melee damage output in all regards
-slow skill and trust progression
-terrible autosave system.
-most of the cons are honestly just small or relatively small elements of what makes this game good. if you don't get into it, you don't get into it, its not really the game being bad, nor is it you missing the point.",1699245261,1700988499,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really think the Story isn't as bad as it's made out to be, I really enjoyed all the characters and branching storylines. Honestly beating the game was a cathartic experience, as you get to see the culmination of all your work and how every relationship builds up towards the end of the game. The gameplay is very good, for me personally the different approaches to dealing with large groups of enemies, balancing weapon types, scavenging materials, planning and strategizing for different encounters was all really enjoyable. The scale of the world is really good without being overwhelming, and does a good job encouraging exploration, which is made even more fun by being able to build and outfit your own badass apocalypse motorcycle. There's some minor glitches to note here and there, and some of the mandatory story missions are less fun than others, but overall a really good game (to beat twice!), plus the added challenges are their own fun experience. Definitely pick this up if you like horror/zombies/open-world/motorcycles. I just with Sony would greenlight Bend Studios to make a second entry but odds are slim on that front.

For me i felt something when Deek put Sara on that chopper hoping to see her again, when Boozer had his Arm injured, and how Deek felt responsible, the entire Nero story line, was brilliant. Lisa story line was just sad. 

I felt bad for tuckers camp, something awe full should had happen to her she was just plain Evil, they way she had people beat in order to maintain order in the camp. I get it people are lazy, but if you threaten and beat them their going to turn on you at some point. and some did

Iron mike was just awesome a bit hard headed and stubborn, and Naive he should have never let skizzo go. this was his biggest mistake.  

the Hordes were fun I would have liked to have them all spawn during the story and not had to wait till i finished the game. I went to quite a few spots where hordes should be and nothing I looked for Caves and the tell tale sign that a horde should be there at least in the day time). I found the sawmill horde before Rikki takes you to it, I had whittled it down before getting Napalm . 

The final fight with Skizzo should have let us stake him outside a horde spot and watch him get ripped apart and listen to his screams (I get what Deek said to skizzo about the freaks but it would have been more satisfying)


I was able to see all endings, I Got 100% all collectibles, Completed Nero story line and received Unknown weapon (Acquired all 18 Items during story play never using any guides to find them) I finished all achievements but 6 and most of those relate to playing the game in New game + and on the different difficulties ( I may do that at a later date) and some of the Lame challenges.


Cons 

i am sick and tired of RUNNERS, WOLVES, RAGE BEARS. 

In the woods there were to many Freakers every time you turned around (Even in the day) they sometimes were everywhere.

the Amount of Ambushes was ridiculous. 

The sniper and Clothesline are way over powered 

The Marauder with the Armor and chain gun (Never running out of ammo) The entire mission where you have to fight the Militia, I swear i  did a head shot on a guy 9 times and he finally died. almost every single militia was ridiculously had to much armor on.

the challenges are just plain crap i only did 2 the horde one, the one where you have to survive against other people. First the horde one there is no way you can control and funnel the horde in that town. that is its biggest mistake, 

in each horde encounter in the story mode I was able to control to some degree the path the horde took when they followed me. I never once had to use machine guns to take the hordes out I mainly used Fire and Explosives. the fact that you spent an entire game building your stats up its all taken away in challenge mode is Absurd.

As for the Challenge where you have to survive against people, Marauders  ETC. after you killed everybody near you and you run and Hide at a new location, more of them run RIGHT TO YOUR NEW POSITION. Like they have radar.

Plays like a collect-a-thon at times, but doesn't wear out its welcome between various missions and story segments.

If there's any negatives beyond that, its the general lack of replayability; sure you get new game+ but by the time you've cleared the game you've essentially unlocked everything. Unless you want to experience the story all over again with the tools and skills to steam roll the entire game, one playthrough is really enough. All that said, the story was enjoyable with only a few nitpicks but nevertheless enough to keep me going through it all to the end.

The open world does ride alongside the story, you rarely just drive around quietly, unless you already finished all the sidequests and just dicking around.

The sound design is pretty good.
The game itself isnt particulary hard, and in a lot of missions your fuel gauge is completely gone/you have infinite ammo for the purpose of the quest.

The hordes can be a challenge, especially if youre at the beginning adn decide to take them on with the starting gear, youll have to get creative.


Still didnt finish the game 40h in, so safe to say its definetly has its value, at least in content.
I guess some of it could be considered repetetive a bit, but again, the dialogue and story keep you going.


Overall id say its like a 7/10 so far, maybe even an 8. Some things are clear they kind of either ran out of budget or decided to skimp on, nothing too important have you, but it does hurt the ""immersion"" a little bit.(like saving random NPCs, that all have really gasping and scared dialogues, but the npc just stands there, and the game forces you to listen to the stiff npc, that eventually runs off screen and dissapears, said npcs are basically the same face almost all of the time. same for side missions, if theyre not over the radio , then theyre in person, where once again, the NPC just kinda stand there, where the dialogue and the emotion doesnt reflect on the NPCs posture, body language etc. This is honetly nit picking at this point, but i had to give one blaring example.

Skill progression is good, weapons are decent, albeit , its clear whoever made them has no idea how guns work. Some also dont make sense, lots of Chinese/russian weapons ...in the rural US. altho, yes theres plenty of other guns.



All in all, its a decent game, even 40h in i still want more, and am kind of excited to where the story will go.
On sale, id say its worth it, although, again for 40h in and with a Newgame+ mode theres deffo more in this game in terms of value, so id say its worth full price aswell.

Pros:
Absolutely gorgeous game with very detailed environment, enjoyable fighting system, an awesome story and absolutely great motorbike riding physics (Riding a motorbike is pure joy tot he point i spent hours riding instead of fast traveling). It gets so many things right that other games don't, even details like the sun rise and sun set dynamic light mechanic animation that even modern AAA games don't get well enough done. Memorable characters, outstanding voice acting, beautiful weather effects, and actual character arc stories for the important characters.

Cons:
Fixing and keeping your bike refueled becomes a chore. 
Game launched with a lot of bugs and issues leading to a lot of bad initial reviews and a low metacritic score which apparently Sony cares a lot more about than the 9+ mil copies this game sold and thus refused the pitch for a sequel.
Further down the line the whole production was accompanied with a lot of drama including baffling public statements from their (now former) director after the game release as well ass a lot of team restruction and disagreements during development.


to wrap up, the game at this point is very fairly fixed and it is totally worth playing.

Days Gone, developed by Bend Studio and released on Steam in 2021, takes players on a harrowing journey through a post-apocalyptic open world.

One of the standout features of Days Gone is its sprawling and atmospheric open-world design. The Pacific Northwest is rendered with stunning detail, featuring diverse landscapes from lush forests to desolate highways. The dynamic weather and day-night cycle contribute to a sense of immersion, with each setting creating a different tone and challenge for players. The sheer size of the map encourages exploration, and the variety of environments keeps the gameplay experience fresh and engaging.

The narrative of Days Gone revolves around Deacon's quest for answers in the wake of personal tragedy. The storyline is well-crafted, with emotional depth and character development that add weight to the overall experience. The relationships between characters, particularly Deacon and his best friend Boozer, contribute to the game's emotional resonance. The main story, coupled with numerous side missions, creates a rich narrative tapestry that unfolds as players traverse the dangerous world.

The gameplay mechanics of Days Gone blend elements of survival, action, and open-world exploration. Motorcycle traversal is a central element, providing a means of transportation that evolves alongside the player's progress. Combat against both human enemies and hordes of Freakers is intense and satisfying, with a diverse arsenal of weapons and tools at the player's disposal. The day-night cycle influences the behavior of the Freakers, adding an extra layer of strategy to encounters.

In conclusion, Days Gone is a gritty and immersive survival adventure that delivers a compelling narrative set in a beautifully realized post-apocalyptic world. The combination of a vast open-world, engaging storytelling, and intense gameplay makes it a standout title for fans of the genre. Despite some initial technical challenges, the developers' commitment to improvement has resulted in a more polished and enjoyable experience, making Days Gone a worthwhile addition to the library of any fan of post-apocalyptic gaming on Steam.",1700748809,1700748809,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

It got destroyed by critics back then, and has had a bad reputation because of it, but its honestly pretty good. Looks and runs great on pc, much better then I remember on console. This game is basically the k-mart version of the last of us. It has its own story, which is kinda cheap in comparison, the combat isnt as deep or mindblowing, like it was in TLOU when it launched way back on ps3. But it still looks and ""feels"" like you typical naughty dog/sony open world action adventure game. 

If you like the look and play style of TLOU and the uncharted series, you pretty know what your going to get here. Again, nothing revolutionary or even ""better"" here vs those other games, which is why I say its like the kmart of them. Like sony made a cheap knockoff of their own IPs. Not saying its BAD, but I do think a big reason why it got so much hate and destroyed by critics is because the time it came out. Other games with that same feel, gameplay and tone already existed, and by sony none the less. But, just because it didnt bring ""anything new to the table"" dont mean its BAD, especially when you look at what its being compared too. Thats some pretty heavy competition in its own right. 

I will say, if you cant run TLOU on here, refuse to buy it because of the launch issues, or just like that style of game, its worth a pickup, especially on a good sale.",1700722350,1700722350,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I saw the news that the game director was indignant about the 68-point review, and that it didn’t say a word about the horde, I thought: “well, the director probably wrote this for a reason, the reviewer must have actually played the entire game hour, and gave this rating because the beginning is slow and not intriguing."" However, after spending 45 hours in the game, I realized that the reviewer even overestimated the rating a little.

Let's start with the very thing that the game director points to - the horde. Given his indignation, it can be assumed that this was the USP of the game, a unique mechanic on which a certain gameplay is tied, which will require the player to use cunning and which will give the player a new, never-before-seen experience. So, this is all complete nonsense. The so-called horde is not some single entity that lives as one organism and requires a special approach from the player, but SIMPLY 100-500 zombies. JUST a crowd of zombies. The usual zombies we meet throughout the game. But there are not 5-10 of them, but JUST 100-500. And they behave like ordinary zombies, without knowing about the existence of other zombies nearby, and without using any unique behavior. These are JUST 100-500 zombies that JUST run after the player. And which you JUST need to kill all of them.
How to kill them correctly? I don't know. The game didn’t teach me anything through text, examples, or level design. Around the horde, the designers simply placed barrels, tanks, bundles of trees and other things, which are located as inconveniently as possible. With a 99% probability, these objects causing damage to the horde will be useless, because the horde does not move in a single stream, but breaks up into hundreds of small rivers, and by “activating” one such object the player will kill, God forbid, at least 10 zombies. In addition, in the game no one ever fights the horde except the player himself, and there is no one to spy on options for dealing with this entity. I’m not talking about the text, this is a completely amateur approach to design, but it’s not here either.
As a result, the easiest way to deal with the horde is to find the nearest building with stairs, and shoot/burn/explode helpless zombies who do not know how to use these stairs. If it’s easier for a player to resort to abuse like this, then your design is... Well, you get the idea.

Let's leave the horde alone, they already suffer from a lack of mechanics. Let's move on to the general gameplay of the game. Do you like clearing out enemy camps? No? It’s a shame, because for some reason the developers decided that this mechanic worked best for them in the game, and they made all the side (and not only side) quests in the game in this format. Need to help a camp with bandits? Clear out the enemy camp. Has someone escaped from the settlement? Clear out the enemy camp. Need to find supplies? Clear out the enemy camp. Is someone asking you to bring something important? Clear out the enemy camp. Need to clear an enemy camp? Not this time, better watch 5 cutscenes in a row.
I think you already understand what I want to say. The game has almost no variety in missions. It was an incredible joy for me when in one of these missions, after clearing the enemy camp, a horde suddenly rained down from the floor above, everything was so monotonous. And these side tasks are arranged to advance the plot so meanly, as if the designers specifically wanted to evoke a feeling of hatred towards themselves. When, after a dramatic scene where almost everything is about to come to a head, you are already anticipating what will happen next, and you are suddenly thrown back into the open world, and they say, “Dick, I have a task here for you,” you want to tear and throw from despair . It's just... bad. The person who made the decision to do this - rot in hell, please. Just like the designer who decided that it would be fun to put a script in a mission with a cave and a horde that prevents you from leaving the cave JUST BECAUSE.

But enough about the bad. The game has some good and some good moments. I won’t go into detail, but I’ll just list:
- Acting and voice acting. The main character is voiced and filmed beautifully. The secondary ones are sagging, but overall they’re not bad either.
- Riding a motorcycle. There is room for improvement, but overall, riding a pumped-up iron horse is quite pleasant.
- General development of the plot. A couple of times I thought I knew what would happen next, but I turned out to be wrong. And this is good. I hate it when the plot is foreshadowed.
- Shooting in slow motion. Overall shooting is below average. If it weren't for the slowdown, I would have put it in the game's cons.

The result is 5/10. The reviewer was right.
I don't recommend the game. Unless with a discount of 50% or higher.",1622843654,1700697685,False,37,2,0.5065193772315979,0,True,False,False

I finished the game. The last 20 hours of it pissed me off more and more to the point that I didn't want to play anymore, but I wanted to finish it.

1. Data collection policy. Read it. They collect all data on your computer. Argue. Ignore it. Don't even think about it. It's still there. It's still a fact, in writing, on the main screen. If you don't have a problem with it, you shouldn't be living in America. 

2. Game breaking bugs. Terrain not loading in causing missions to fail. Story items, characters or objectives glitching out or not appearing at all. This was all luckily fixed by restarting the game. But this game has been out for awhile and they still exist going into 2023. Lazy.

3. Story. I hate any story, any game, any book, anything that allows the story, in this case, the bad guys, to be driven forward by pure COINCIDENCE. And that's all the major turning point was near the end of the game. Pure coincidence that a plan failed, that the bad guys were at the right place at the right time, where all the key players were in a spot where they didn't need to be. Or the fact that they are even around at all because ""killing is bad"". Unrealistic in a world like this. 

4. Bullet sponge mechanics. Both the player and the enemies in higher difficulties. Never mind that the game doesn't allow you to change the difficulty settings on the fly, like most games these days. But they make it worse by never introducing armor into the game and harder enemies in the earlier stages, so they make up for it by making you the player a unstoppable force in Easy-Normal. Then turn around in any enemy above Hard capable of taking 10-15 bullets to the body on normal enemies. It is and always will be the lazy mans way of turning up the difficulty. DO NOT play on Easy or Normal if you actually want to enjoy the game. I regret playing on Normal and realized too far in that I couldn't change it, I didn't want to spend 2 days going back.

4. Mods. This game SUCKS without mods. The fact no one has heard of backpacks but a hand full of newts, is CRAZY to me. But mods fix everything but the bugs in the game. Check them out on Vortex/Nexus mods. Making Hordes ACTUALLY dangerous. Making special infected show up more than once in your ENTIRE playthrough. Making bounties actually worth it (if someone only have me $5 for a Freaker ear IRL, I'd spit in their face). Giving vendors more than garbage. Removing the ""trust"" system all together to favor the real life aspect of ""you got money? I got stuff"". And much much more. I can't recommend any game that requires so much reworking from the modding community to actually be enjoyable.

Love the story, mostly. Love the ending. Love most of characters. 

SPOILER RANT BELOW

As mentioned above, the story relies heavily on coincidence. There was zero reason why Deek had to lie to Captain about the name of his wife. There was zero reason they had to keep their relationship a secret once they found each other in the camp. This does nothing but give the douche bag of the game reason and ammo to use against him as a plot point. 

On top of Wizard Mountain, the douche of the game reappears suddenly and the Col just happens to be there as well. Of course, this happens during a big plan to escape with the military, because of course it does. Douche charges at Deek, which should have gotten his ass kicked by every lower ranking solider within ear shot. What happens instead? The Col listens to this new recruit over Deek, the man he knows was in the Army before the infection began, the man that has been single handedly getting things done in and around the base, bringing all their efforts and projects to fruition. At the same time, Deek suddenly becomes daft and doesn't use his position to spin whatever tale he wants about this rando that just showed up to base. Furthermore, Deek doesn't just tell the Col that he was a biker before the infection began and explains his tattoo; why would the Col take issue with it anyway? Cerberus was Greek Mythology, and quite clearly a biker gang dog symbol more than anything, which is tame to literally all the other biker gangs in this country. At the exact same time, the Col has an revaluation that he must purge all other humans from this land and everyone else is just ok with killing random humans; even tho it goes directly against everything hes been saying since before Deek got there. It's stupid. 

Also, no one, not one person that found out there was a gated facility with power, food, supplies, ammo, and had actual access to it, would leave that place after finding it. You're telling me not one Ripper, scavenger or otherwise went up that way and tried to go inside after seeing everything in there? Not one living soul on this Earth in any apocalyptic scenario you can possibly imagine, would leave that facility after discovering it. Your'e an idiot if you think otherwise. Deek and Sarah could have setup shop there, brought who they wanted into the facility, setup watch towers and fortified the main gate and cleared trees away from the fence line then lived happily ever after. Also, how did Sarah take a look around the secret lab and just magically find out that is where it all began? Why does she not explain it all to us or give us freedom to look around and read or listen to some lore? Why did we just spend hours getting there and can't even look around the lab ourselves? Why? Lazy storytelling, that's why. 

But the thing I hate the most, is this bigoted sensation in all forms of media, feeling like they need to go out of their way to create blasphemous garbage and put a crazy false Christian into their story. This is where the Chinese ties shine through. Just because they don't believe anything more than we are living on a rock hurling through space, controlled by the rich and powerful that are slowly killing this planet, too afraid to do anything about it. I enjoy videos games, violent video games, and I'm Christian... But burning churches and killing randoms for being in the church... The big gay Col spouting blasphemy about what he believes is ordained by God. False Christian crusaders and more, it is too much for me or anyone else with a moral backbone to follow. Just building more false narratives against us and I don't appreciate it. Any real Christian in the Colonel's position would have be doing what Iron Mike did. Not starting a ""holy"" war like some lunatic Catholic in the crusades. It's laughable at the least and it's insultingly stupid at it's worst. And more than just Deek and the Capt would have had something to say about it too. Especially all those people in the work camp. 

May God have mercy on your souls. And you won't be getting another dollar from me, Guerrilla and Sony, from here to the grave. It's all resellers and pawn shops from here. <3

The game also introduces a unique mechanic called the ""Freaker"" horde, where players face massive groups of zombies that require careful planning and execution to overcome. The varied gameplay mechanics ensure that players are constantly engaged and challenged.

Compelling Characters:
One of the standout aspects of Days Gone is its well-developed characters. Deacon St. John, the protagonist, is a complex and relatable character with a troubled past and a strong sense of loyalty. The supporting cast is equally compelling, with each character having their own motivations and story arcs. The interactions between characters, coupled with stellar voice acting, create a truly immersive and memorable experience.

Continuous Updates and Support:
Since its release, Days Gone has received regular updates and support from the developers. These updates have not only addressed bugs and technical issues but have also introduced new features and content, enhancing the overall gameplay experience. This commitment to post-launch support demonstrates the dedication of the development team and their willingness to listen to player feedback.

Conclusion:
Days Gone is a must-play game for any fan of the action-adventure genre. With its engaging storyline, stunning open-world environment, intense gameplay, compelling characters, and continuous updates, it offers an immersive gaming experience that keeps players hooked from start to finish. Bend Studio has created a masterpiece that showcases their talent and dedication to delivering a high-quality gaming experience. Whether you're a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre or simply looking for an exhilarating adventure, Days Gone is a game that should not be missed.",1700614859,1700614859,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

[h1][i]Story:[/i][/h1]
 First off, i want to start with saying cinematography in this game is very good. You can clearly see this game really cares about it's story but i wish i could care about it too. I have seen people who likes the story and characters of Days Gone but I can not make myself like it as i have experienced way better stories in games like Red Dead Redemption 2, God of War, Last of Us etc. I even have seen people who says Boozer is the best supporting character in video games even though he is just someone we babysit for the most part of the story. I think story might be the weakest part of Days Gone. I will try to talk about it without giving any spoilers. First off, story has tempo problems. Just when the story starts to get interesting , the game begins to give unnecessary tasks like babysitting Boozer or finding some guys MP3 player. That's why i kept losing interest in story. Also character relationships are not making any sense too. Immediately after arguing with a character, in the next mission, they continue to talk as if nothing happened. Sometimes some characters are doing unnecessary things just to make story more dramatic. And i didn't feel anything at those scenes because there is no way they would happen in a realistic story. I also have to mention that i didn't feel like Deacon which is the protagonist of Days Gone, has one main purpose that he follows. You may like the story maybe because it has a theme we don't encounter much but these are the main reasons why i couldn't like the story of Days Gone.

[u][b]A Quick Tip: Do not close the game right after finishing the story. There is 4 more cutscenes. Here is how you can get them:[/b][/u]

[h1][i]Graphics:[/i][/h1]
  It is not hard to see that graphics of Days Gone is gorgeous. Texture quality is very good and it does feel good to look at the world of Days Gone. The graphics with music makes the atmosphere so strong which makes it very immersive to hang out in the world of Days Gone. If you love taking screenshots in games, Days Gone is the right game for you.


[h1][i]Gameplay:[/i][/h1]
  As i said before it is very fun and immersive to travel around in open world and we do that with a bike. Bike is like horses in RDR2. Although it is not a living being, you have to care for it. You have to fix it and you have to fill it with fuel when it's out of it because if you don't, you are going to walk until you found fuel. This is a good thing if you want more immersion. At first i didn't like this to much but when i learned how it works it just made the game more immersive for me. Days Gone's open world may be immersive, however it doesn't offer anything but same open world activities we have seen in so many other games gameplaywise. You have to do these activities if you want to upgrade gear, bike and unlock new skills because it is rewarding player with credit, experience and trust of the camps. The problem is these activities gets boring because they are repetitive. This is not a big problem early on but later at the game you will encounter too many hordes. Hordes are one of the few things that makes Days Gone special. They can make the game more exciting when they came out of nowhere. As you can guess it's not very easy to fight with hordes especially if you didn't invest in the right skills. If you don't want to do boring open world activities later for some skill points like me, i recommend to you to acquire the skill that improves the number of items you carry like bombs and molotov cocktails. Because those items are the most helpful ones when you are fighting a horde. Combatwise you have two options: melee and ranged. Melee is all about dodging and attacking. Yes, there is different melee weapons but gameplaywise they are all same. Only difference is their damage and durability. You can only counter by pressing a button that appears in screen when an enemy grabs them witch makes melee combat limited. Early on, another thing that makes melee combat limited is stamina management. Main problem with it that it refills so slow. Once player is out of stamina and there is a crowd of freakers, you will going to take a lot of damage until dodging and running becomes available again which is very annoying. But you will encounter with these problems only at the beginning of your playthrough. Ranged combat though is way better than melee. Variety of ranged weapons is good enough and enemies are reacting to bullets as they should even if it's not the best i have seen. Classic weapon wheel we know is named as survival wheel in Days Gone witch is understandable because it isn't only allowing you to choose weapons, it's also allowing you to craft and use items like molotov cocktail and bandage. It's very easy and comfortable to use survival wheel. 	 

[h1][i]Music:[/i][/h1]
 Music in this game does it's job well and makes the atmosphere way stronger which is more than enough. I will keep listening some songs from Days Gone in my daily life and i'm sure you will find something for your taste too.

[h1][i]Technical:[/i][/h1]
  Game runs with 50-60 FPS with mix of medium and high graphic settings at 1080p on GTX 1650 Ti laptop. One other positive technically is i didn't see any bugs at my 50 hour playthrough so i can say that it is a very solid PC port. However don't expect an AI like MGSV. Freakers can be deadly when they attack as crowd but they are not a big danger when they're alone and that's okay because they're not suppose to be smart. Main problem with AI is human enemies. They are neither good at forcing player to get out of cover nor staying behind cover themselves.

[h1][i]Conclusion:[/i][/h1]
 If Days Gone didn't have a unique theme, i probably would give it a negative review with the fact that i didn't like the story and i'm bored of these Ubisoft style open world designs. But even though Days Gone didn't liked by the critics on it's release, i believe every gamer who is into zombies and post-apocalyptic theme should give it a chance.",1680275710,1700592425,True,74,4,0.79645085334777832,10,True,False,False

I don't like zombies in general, but these are also OK in this game. Playing in hard difficulty and I am in constant shortage of everything, as I should in a post-apocalyptic world. Supports ultrawide.

There are bigger drawbacks also, though, and those are easier to list.
- It is a clear console port, so the controls and menu design are clunky and inconvenient.
- The menu and white background are the worst bad design choices, but also the irritating ""push and hold the key"" logic for interactions instead of just push the damn key.
- I am about 34 hours in and I still do not get how the missions and story lines work - they appear and disappear randomly in the menu without any explanation what is going on. Dr Google also is not clear on that, so I just try to go with the flow, but irritating that I don't understand what is going on.
- Extended mission info is not displayed anywhere - what do I have to do and why? If you do not pay attention or the mission was given to you some time ago and you don't remember, then you will miss it.
- Some characters are made unbelievably unrealistic in their actions. Even after zombie apocalypse, I am sure people would keep some common sense, especially if your life depends on it.
- Buying weapons from vendors has been totally pointless for me so far - depending on your play style, the weapons you get from enemies may be better for you even if in bad condition.
- Some game mechanics are not explained at all.
- Also not explained is that you cannot save far away from you bike, even if you think that you have saved. 
- The max fuel amount in the bike is clearly out of balance and it is super annoying to fuel up all the f... time.

Still a good game though, but if they would ever make a sequel, a lot needs to be addressed for it to be more successful.",1700497974,1700497974,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons: 
-The majority of the dialogue is awful especially by main characters. It's cringey, and without spoiling anything, makes zero sense according to the relationships. The main character can't say two words without stumbling or using filler words. I despise every minute of it.
-Story is very cut and dry and predictable with the exception of a few moments.
-Some enemies, like wolves, are just annoying and provide zero challenge. 
-Bike combat is boring as can be.
-Repetitive side missions

Pros:
-Absolutely gorgeous open world with incredible whether effects such as rain, fog, snow, ect.
-Night time really amps up the difficulty and provides some seriously intense moments
-Some very well though out main campaign missions
-The game runs like a dream, very well optimized. Have not encountered a single bug.
-Shooting actually feels really good, and the variety of weapons really lets you customize your arsenal to the situation you are going after.
-The hordes are just so cool. I don't know how else to put it, just go experience it for yourself.
-Traversal is just plain excellent (Outside of a super thirsty gas tank especially during the early hours). The bike feels looks excellent while exploring. I still prefer to drive over using fast travel, it's that great.

while the initial segment is executed finely, the subsequent hours may appear somewhat lackluster, shaping the initial perception of a player. however, the game steadily ascends in quality. following the introduction to the third encampment, the story gains depth, revealing the intricate layers of deacon's character.

deacon's relationships with boozeman, kouri, skizzo, rikki, and iron mike provide personal glimpses into his character. coupled with his response to the loss of sarah gives a humane nature to the narrative. additionally, his attitude towards iron mike’s encampment and the wizard island. over 9 hours of cinematically presented cutscenes, bend studio's commitment to storytelling is evident, showcasing the actors' performances.

deacon saint john, an ex-military soldier adorned in the colors of the separated mongrels motorcycle club. deacon surpasses the stereotype of a disgruntled character while grieving his presumed-dead wife, appreciating his existing mongrels brother boozeman, he navigates a post-apocalyptic oregon with a hint of purpose. his military expertise and readiness to get his hands dirty make him a protagonist unafraid to tackle any circumstance thrown at him.

sam witwer's portrayal of deacon is executed flawlessly, conveying a range of emotions seamlessly. minute details, such as deacon's trigger discipline or the tone of his voice to passengers on board while travelling via the motorcycle reflect the meticulous thought and love invested in the game's development.

the array of emotions portrayed within a single scene’s impressive. while dealing with an horde, you can hear deacon go from a calm state to a panicked state to a panicked yet confidently aggressive state.

the motorcycle mechanics strike realism and enjoyment, making the driving experience unparalleled. the relationship with the motorcycle goes beyond typical game dynamics. manual tasks like filling the gas tank add to the immersive gameplay. exploring the world manually, despite the option to fast travel, unveils unique experiences and errands through deacon's radio.

the rippers, a cult that worships the freakers as they feel they are a species who aren’t troubled by their past is a good measure of what circumstances that of days gone can do to certain people. 

while traversing the world of days gone, you can get ambushed by rippers along with marauders. whether it’d be with a tripwire completely damaging your motorcycle or a sniper bullet knocking you off your motorcycle. ambushes and damage to the motorcycle necessitate repairs whether it’d be from a mechanic or scrap found, which overall enhances the survival aspect.

hordes, a standout feature from the E3 2016 showcase, deliver an adrenaline-inducing experience. strategic planning and quick thinking are imperative when facing these massive zombie swarms. the variety of freaker types, each with distinct characteristics, further enriches the gameplay.

days gone masterfully employs lighting to accentuate its graphical prowess. oregon's diverse landscapes, from lush forests to snow-covered mountains, contribute to the game's visual allure. I really do want to stress how visually stunning days gone really is however I’m not great with formulating words in order to describe graphical aspects. I found myself hitting the road manually rather than using the fast travel feature as it allowed me to further appreciate the graphical delight that it is.

in conclusion, days gone is a must-play, with its positives far outweighing any negatives. it remains an underappreciated gem, unjustly overshadowed. the game's potential for a sequel is undeniable, and it's profoundly unfortunate how playstation denied it. 

thank you, bend studios.",1700339255,1700339297,True,130,4,0.818303406238555908,0,True,False,False

I was excited for Days Gone back when it was first advertised for PS4, and seriously considered getting a PlayStation just to play it, but ultimately didn't. Now years later it's come to PC and I've finally had the chance to play it. Despite my huge expectations for this game I was not at all disappointed. The game is just as good as I always thought it would be. 

It took me 62 hours to 100% all of the storylines without using any fast travel, which I'd say is a good amount of game time for the price. The challenge mode also provides some additional game time, especially if you wanted to get Gold on all of them.

The gameplay itself is great, fighting the hordes is of course the best part, but the missions, and general interactions with the world, are also very enjoyable. Riding from one section of the map to another is always entertaining as there are so many unexpected things that you have to deal with, be it a roadside ambush, running out of fuel or accidentally driving into the middle of a horde- which I did several times. 

One of the only things I'd have changed would be the impact of dying for the player. You really don't face any consequences for dying in this game, you just respawn nearby. If you lost all of your ammo, or even your guns, it would certainly raise the stakes.

In all a fantastic game that I'd love to see a  sequel for, as unlikely as that may be now.",1700297175,1700297175,True,1,0,0.507143795490264893,0,True,False,False

The story is engaging, with you controlling the main character Deacon and bouncing from survivor camp to survivor camp, looking for your wife, fighting off a freaker (zombie) invasion, and just generally causing some mayhem. There are some pretty well written characters here, and the story takes some pretty dramatic twists and turns that keep you engaged.

Combat itself is very smooth and is kind of the star of the show. Fighting freakers just feels plain old fun. You can use melee weapons (that you can find or craft yourself) or ranged weapons, as well as use explosives, distractions, and other such devices. You generally have pretty limited ammo, which at times can make situations pretty tense, and the freakers are something else. They run, they dodge shots, they flank, they cover their face to protect their head, and other awesome things that really makes the enemy AI fun to fight. You can die easily. Combat is very tense, and exploring freaker caves and dark locations really brings about a feeling of anxiety and dread. It's fantastic.

There's a level up system where you can add skills to your character, with XP earned by questing or killing enemies. Camps have a faction-ish type system where if you do runs and jobs for them, you'll gain their trust, get credits for their camps, and be able to purchase better bike parts and weapons. It keeps progression moving nicely. And speaking of progression, the freakers evolve constantly throughout the game. You wind up fighting some pretty crazy stuff. It's great. 

And then there's exploration. You'll get to explore destroyed villages, camps, small towns, industrial complexes, science facilities, and so much more. There's tons of loot for you to collect along the way, which goes hand in hand with the crafting system. Plus, the world just looks beautiful and is fun to explore.

About the only downside of this game is that the mouth animations during dialogue aren't great and can be a bit jarring at times, especially for minor characters, and that the game doesn't really have much of a choice/consequences system. There are a few minor choices you can make in the game that impact the story, but otherwise it's a bit linear. Other than that, highly recommend.",1700269466,1700269466,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
*Beautiful open world
*great atmosphere
*mostly likeable characters
*gunplay
*bike physics/riding
*gfx (besides some character models)

Cons:
*women character models /faces are ugly wtf?!
*repeptetive missions. even in main story missions the mission designs dont vary alot from each other
*the game has some issues that pile up on each other.:
*The story is serviceable but stretched thin. 
*The game overstays its welcome because of different reasons. Since missions are repetetive and the story isnt really complex or layered the game drags on after a certain point.
*Weird design choices of the devs  make the final  part of the game even more of a slog: Hey how about we give you a feeling of urgency and make you drive somewhere and put 3 seperate enemy bases in your way with enemies that are much more durable then before and then let you fight hordes and hordes of zombies. (just an example there are some more things like this.)
*enemy variety is poor. and some enemies are annoying . e.g.
 there is an enemy type that i only fought twice because of story reasons since the enemy type was annoying as hell. so i rather did choose to run.
*the game doesnt warn you at certain points before some very hard missions so you might go in with insufficient ammo/throwables and kinda get screwed
*close quarters horde fight story quest -> who tf thought of this

All in all the framework for a great game is there but quests need to be more varied, game should have been shorter and the story  a little bit more layered. If a second game would have been greenlit i'd be hooeful for them to be pulling it of but unfortunately a second game will never happen.

The combat is satisfying and fun to engage with, but after 4+ hours of of it with no variation to be seen (not even different enemy types), it gets incredibly tedious and frustrating to the point that I found myself avoiding enemies simply because I got bored of fighting them. Then comes the story, which I can only describe as confusing; everyone is blatantly and pointlessly hostile to one another, 90% of the quests are just disguised fetch quest and usually revolve around you being everyone's errand boy, and half the time it feels like the protagonist is actively trying to sabotage himself and those trying to help him.

Let's face it: the action/adventure/shooter/survival genre can get a bit stale once you've gathered enough/get enough XP/access the choice unlocks. And while Days Gone is no exception to the rule, it still stands out as a game I'd recommend to anyone curious about it.

Why?

Because this game lives in it's story. While the writing of the dialogue is questionable at times, the quality of the cutscenes, motion capture, and voice acting are excellent. The actors and actresses deliver compelling performances, despite the writing being a bit....""wooden"", at times. 

And for anyone who likes to spend time outdoors or on a bike- this game is GORGEOUS, and a real treat to explore. I never found myself getting bored of tearing around a fictionalized version of post-apocalyptic Oregon on the back of a bike. You know it's good when, like me, you opt to skip fast travel for the open road because the bike mechanics/physics/responsiveness are so good! 

And boy howdy, hordes are and absolute blast to deal with. 

It's the first ""far cry formula"" title I find myself considering a New Game+ and going back to complete the challenges. 

TLDR: ""One of the strongest 7/10 titles in the genre."". Anyone on fence about it might be pleasantly surprised by the quality of the story and presentation. The gameplay loop, beautiful presentation, and bike mechanics were enough to keep me invested. I loved it, despite some of the typical pitfalls games in this genre tend to have.",1699550439,1699550439,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I close the game after a long gaming session my programs stops responding, all of them! 
I have no idea what they've put in that game that freezes every programs and I'm wondering if the other reports from other players about the privacy issue/data collection is related and/or true? 
Maybe they run a background process that's actually harmful for your PC. 

I got a beast of a PC, 5900X with a 3080Ti, 64GB DDR4 @3600mhz. Game is installed on my M.2 NVME SSD and it's weird.

Task manager, firefox, even the calculator is bugged, it removes all the headers from my programs and I can't right click programs in task manager to end processes. I had to hard shutdown my computers 3 times before I decided that that was enough and uninstalled it.

The gameplay isn't bad at all, pretty fun actually but I've had a couple times where I get 3 wolves attack me at the same time as a cougar and then a bear shows up all at the same time, I have no idea why they decided these events makes for fun gameplay but I didn't like it even if I ended up killing everything with no problems that's just bad design in my opinion.

The hordes are really fun, really gets the blood pumping.

The wires on the road had me fuming because you never see them until it's way too late and it instantly breaks your bike, so you have to find scraps to repair your bike and it's way too expensive. Same for the snipers perched in the trees that you never see aiming at your engine block and instantly shoots it with hitscan breaking your bike down. Again that's a bad design.

I liked a couple of characters in the beginning. Boozer was cool, Rikki and Skyzzo too. Iron Mike and O'Brian. But once you reach the military camp with the stupid leader who keeps talking about God and Noah's Ark? It's pretty much over... Seriously guys it's 2023 can we please stop the religious freak talk already? Keep that out of games it's so bad I just decided to skip everything they said.

In the end... Once I reached the point of the militia camp I just stopped caring about every characters, even the main character's wife. 

Couple of times the camps just stops giving you work too so if you want an upgrade from them, you gotta grind it out for hours killing zombies and turning their ears in for reputation.

I don't know... I wouldn't recommend it personally but if Steam had a Mixed review that's probably where I'd put it.
The North portion of the map was really fun but after that it goes down in quality. 

The freezing all your programs after you close the game is really something that got me worried, it's the only game that has ever done that to me. The game doesn't crash for me at least there's that...",1699517922,1699517922,False,3,0,0.48350071907043457,0,True,False,False

Is it broken? Still buggy, even years later? Rushed? Yes.
Does it have clunky gameplay? Repetitive missions? Cliche methods of restricting the player? Yes to all.

Is it worth playing?
Definitely.

Whatever downsides Days Gone has, are completely overshadowed, in my opinion, by the care and effort that has been put in its story and, most importantly, its characters. The writing does a great job at making every character into a personality, but it's the voice acting that takes them to the next level and makes them human.
Because that was the bottom line for me in Days Gone: this is not ""just another zombie shooter"", ""just another open world game"", ""just another (insert your pick)"", this is a raw and honest story about humans and humanity. The ""good guys"" are flawed, and carry the weight of their flaws with them. The ""bad guys"" have reasons for being ""bad"", reasons behind their actions, even redeeming qualities. Even the cartoonish over the top villains are given an explanation of what has driven them to their current state.
Another strong point is the depiction of trauma. These are broken people living broken lives in a broken world, doing whatever they can to maintain a sense of humanity. It's a story of hope, but the characters are fearful of holding that hope, simply because it can be lost so easily. There will be no knight in shining armor coming for the princess, and the princess would be shellshocked anyway, holding a knife to the knight's throat. I can't think of many games that have depicted dealing with the past and finding strength to seek the future as well as Days Gone. The story is filled with emotion, but a lot of it is suppressed and muted. Once again... human.
Moving on to more mundane opinions, two other open world games came to my mind while playing, for two reasons, namely Mad Max and Red Dead Redemption.
First reason: the game world. Beautifully crafted, and a pleasure to look at and drive through, with plenty of attention to finer details that make it feel... maybe not real, but definitely believable.
Second: the drifter bike. Just as your horse in Red Dead, or the Magnum Opus in Mad Max, the bike starts as a transportation tool, but over the time gradually becomes an extension of yourself and just as much a character as anyone with a voice.

Is it a masterpiece? No. The decisions made by Sony have left a heavy impact, and it would be dishonest to deny that.
It is, however, an uncut diamond in the rough. Bend Studio have done their best to deliver a great experience, and in my opinion, they succeeded. We can only hope they get a chance at a sequel, and the ability to tell us more.",1699462684,1699462846,True,1,0,0.522293031215667725,0,True,False,False

[b] This is a great single player game for those who love to be immersed in a world that shows more than tells to get its story across.  Definitely worth the price especially if you get it on sale. [/b]

[h1] The Story [/h1]
The story in the game is good but falls just short of being great.  The game drops you immediately into the world and has you learning of events on the fly.  The main story is somewhat predictable at times and at other times has interesting twists, it starts off slow and at times it is hard to care about the story in the beginning but further on it had me actually invested in the characters.  I found some of the more interesting world building of the story comes from collectibles.  All in all the story could have been closer to the league of The Last of Us, if it had a bit more polish on writing, voice acting, cut scene animations, etc. but is not bad by a longshot.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
The gameplay is where Days Gone really shines through, I just finished a play-through on normal difficulty and I wish I had started on hard.  You start off in the game very weak with limited weapons and ability to deal with the dangers you come across in the world this is where a lot of the fun of the game come from.  Towards the end of the game on normal however, I felt like a super soldier.  --Will be playing through again later on Survival II.  

[h1] Bugs [/h1]
Very minimal bugs, I only experienced a couple times of things not loading in correctly in the world, only one of these was during a mission which I had to reload the checkpoint but that fixed it.

The map size is quite decent, with lots of things to do. I always felt like this game is comparable to Red Dead Redemption, but you have a bike instead of a horse, and takes place in a post-virus pandemic. I really appreciated this game but I don't think I would replay it ever again. Besides the main story the game is quite bland, rinse and repeat, and not much enemy variety. It's a good starting point for this Bend Studio and it can be improved to make a really amazing game. I would recommend getting this game when it's on sale, many hours of gameplay and a good storyline.",1691726562,1699337612,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So long as you can handle repetitive gameplay for the side content then it's a great game for those who like a good story and good gameplay for the main story's content.

Story is done very well and has massive impact mostly due to animations of characters, which makes them feel more like actual survivors who you're wanting to connect with instead of just an NPC in a game who's asking you to do a bunch of stuff.

Example (not an exact one) without spoilers:
Guy does something that lady doesn't like. Lady VERBALLY approves, but VISIBLY (animation-wise) disapproves, at least slightly. The disapproval is confirmed later, as well.

My only long-standing complaint is how fast travel DELAYS so many things which are required in order to progress quests

Bend Studio® also released a statement on X (formerly twitter) to condemn the director himself for being a human being.

Sony Entertainment® obviously learned their lesson, as they now use PR firms such as ""Sweet Baby Inc."" to review their games for diversity, equity AND inclusion. they also filter out any content people should not see. i hope to see many of these highly anticipated and chock-full of artistic integrity games on my steam store in the near future. thank you to the true heroes!

Alright, folks, hold onto your handlebars because we're diving headfirst into the post-apocalyptic mayhem of Days Gone, where the undead don't politely stay dead! It's like Sons of Anarchy meets World War Z, and it's a wild ride!

So, you're Deacon St. John, a gruff biker dude with the coolest name ever. He's not exactly the guy you'd pick to save the world, but hey, life's full of surprises. And when it's swarming with zombie-like ""Freakers,"" you take what you can get.

The Good Stuff:

Biker's Paradise: Riding your hog through the beautiful, decaying Pacific Northwest is a blast. It's like a cross-country road trip but with more zombies and less scenic overlooks.

Zombie Horde Spectacle: Those Freaker hordes are like a mobile mosh pit from hell. Seriously, it's like Coachella, but with fewer flower crowns and more gnashing teeth.

Crafting & Survival: You'll be scavenging everything from nails to sterilized bandages to create some wicked zombie-slaying weaponry. It's like MacGyver with more motor oil.

The Not-So-Good Stuff:

Open World Fatigue: Sometimes you'll feel like a post-apocalyptic FedEx delivery guy, running around from one errand to another. ""Hey Deacon, can you pick up my lost cat while you're at it?""

Deacon's Mood Swings: Deacon can be a real drama queen sometimes. He's all serious one minute, cracking jokes the next. Make up your mind, man!

Freaker Traffic Jams: When you stumble upon a horde, it's a beautiful mess. But sometimes they get stuck on an abandoned car, and you're like, ""Come on, guys, move it! We've got a schedule here!""

In the end, Days Gone is a fun and unpredictable zombie-slaying extravaganza, perfect for anyone who's ever wondered how they'd survive a zombie apocalypse on two wheels. Just be prepared for the occasional traffic jam of undead enthusiasts and Deacon's roller-coaster emotions.

The motorcycle is slow and cumbersome. I would say something positive but I truly cannot think of one thing that I really enjoyed or that stood out to me. If you have to try it, wait for a sale.

I got it on sale for $17 and it's been worth every penny. Honestly it's worth the $40. 

The game is pretty challenging at the beginning, but you get stronger as time goes on. The zombies still aren't something to mess with though, a horde will tear you to shreds and you get hit hard in this game. Can we also talk about the hordes??

The gameplay loop is very well done, same as the world building, weapons, progression, audio / sound design and in general every aspect of the game is very, very, very well done.
Riding a bike in the zombie apocalypse never felt as good and the killing of hordes feels soooo right, better then I have experienced in another 3D Open World game.

It does suffer from the Ubisoft-issue of completing checkmarks on a map which turns repetitive quickly, but then again, the gameplay is so satisfying that it doesn't feel like grinding.

The story while it picks up nicely, in my personal opinion, it tries to go for too much, and you might also have the feeling that the game is coming to it's end without having time to properly close / address all it's opened topics, and you will be right.
Personally, I would still see the story, but don't expect to be blown away by it's story, mainly on the final act, it's seriously let down and ends with a ""okay, I guess that's the end then"". The ride there was very much enjoyable, even if it can't stick a proper landing.

Still, a great game that is easy to recommend.
Expect about 30-80 hours of gameplay depending how much you want to see (story vs complete almost every achievement), more if you plan on completing NG+ in higher difficulties / enjoy the Horde Killing.

The writing, voice acting, and story telling are great. The world map gave me another similar sensation to the amount of time it took, in that the world map is actually gigantic, and there's so much to do that doesn't feel repetitive or a chore like most huge rpgs of this style.

The whole story of the game is just mind blowing, the twists & turns for the main characters Deacon & Sarah was the most interesting for me because thats what hooked me till the time until Deacon finds Sarah alive, maybe I just got connected to their lives more than just a game that's why I even played to see their long lost reunite moment & its no shame that it was a moment of relief for me to see them together again after so long time. 

I played this game more for like not for the sake of just completing the mission moreover I played it more as of emotional connect with the main characters of the game & indeed their love story was the most engaging part for me. So I will say yes its the best game in terms of action, strategy & of course if you get connected with the lives of main characters that's what makes it even more engaging while playing.

For those who've played Days Gone on PS5, many will attest to its captivating allure, especially with its unmatched off-road motorcycle physics. I owned a 2016 BMW scrambler, and I was awed by how the in-game bike felt strikingly similar. From the gravity to the gear shifts and clutch work, it felt authentic. One of the highlights? The fuel economy system, where one has to strategically ease up on descents to conserve fuel.

The magic of Days Gone truly unfolds after the prologue, particularly when you encounter characters like Obrian and make it to Lost-Lake. As the story progresses, far from becoming tedious, the game becomes even more absorbing. The serenity of bike rides set against a backdrop of guitar tunes, breathtaking landscapes, and the adrenaline of chasing hordes is pure joy.

Despite its evident commercial success and adoration from a significant portion of the player base, the news of its sequel's cancellation, supposedly due to a handful of negative reviews, is deeply disappointing.

Roaming the wilderness, day and night.
Bikers' creed, a brotherhood they share,
In this bleak world, they find their care.

Freakers roam, a relentless, haunting horde,
As hope emerges, a glimmer, not ignored.
Among the ruins, a tale to be told,
In this desolation, the story unfolds.

A motorbike, a trusty steed to ride,
Through danger and sorrow, on the other side.
In Days Gone, where choices cut like knives,
Will Deacon find redemption in these lives?

The open road, a path both wild and free,
In the heart of chaos, a world to see.
A gaming world, where memories are sown,

The game's appearance is amazing. The bleak Oregon environment, following the apocalypse, is stunningly dark. It may not be the green, scenic open world that you would anticipate, but that's a positive attribute. The story has a gritty and worn feel that fits the mood perfectly. The realistic weather and day/night cycle add depth.

Deacon St. John, a tough biker with a big heart, tries to find his place in a world overrun by Freakers. Despite his rough edges, Deacon's character is strangely charming.

The game Days Gone has amazing gameplay. You'll love riding your motorcycle through the wilderness because it feels like an extension of you. The combat against hordes of Freakers is intense and requires strategy and resource management. It can get pretty challenging!

However, there are some issues with the game. The pacing might feel slow, especially in the early hours. There are some errors, but not important ones.

Optional quests have different levels of enjoyment, but some are entertaining and enhance the game world. The developers made an effort to fix the issues after release. Encountering survivor camps gives the game a human touch after the apocalypse, which I liked.

In the end, Days Gone may not have been extremely popular, but it is a good game and an underrated gem in the zombie apocalypse genre. If you like games set in open-world environments that have a bit of a dark side and lots of zombies, you should try this one out. It's not flawless, but it's a diamond in the rough that deserves attention from those who are willing to give it a chance.",1694119182,1698457829,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

It probably could have used another six months in the oven to clean up some glitches (you'll know what I'm talking about when you encounter them). Not game breaking, but likely could have been avoided with some extra QA testing.

Visuals are great. I played it on an Asus ROG Ally on the 'High' preset @ 900p. I have a 3080Ti desktop in the other room, but I can't game on that while I lay my fat arse in bed.

Story line is compelling, characters are semi-interesting. Gun play is excellent, to include the slow-motion 'Focus' feature that I think started getting traction in that old game Red Dead Revolver, then became a staple in RDR and RDR2.

A long game. I got about 85 hours into it before I had eliminated all the hordes. Still didn't 100% the game though, but close. You cold probably finish the game from opening scene to roll the end credits in maybe 60-65 hours. There's just so much to do outside of the main story line. The map will indicate random encounters nearly every time you set out to go anywhere. A couple of moments in the story line will choke up all but the hardest of criminals.

Plenty to collect and plenty to do. Or you can play straight through the game movie style. A bargain at full price, but you can get it a lot cheaper during a Steam sale these days.

Best part of the game, bar none, are the hordes. There's something truly terrifying about sneaking up on a 250 zombie horde, only for one of them to notice you and alert the whole place to your presence.

This game has WAAAY too much bloom, and even buying more accurate guns and getting the skill that improves gun accuracy barely helps. It feels like 80% of the time when the reticle is dead center on an enemy's head, the shot misses anyways. On the other hand, when I fire when the reticle is clearly not pointed at the enemy, the game frequently decides to randomly give me a headshot anyways. Inconsistent gun mechanics makes very single gunfight is insanely annoying.

When it comes to stealth, once a single enemy spots you, all enemies immediately know your exact location, and they will never lose track of you, even when the HUD tells you you cannot be seen or heard. There are a few exceptions, like dumpsters you can hide in, but they aren't available in most places. Some times, enemies also literally spawn right next to you.

Riding the bike around is usually pretty fun, until a sniper randomly spots you, and by that time it is impossible to run away/hide, so you just get shot, fall of your bike, and die. Wolves are also extremely annoying, as even when you outrun them, they'll just teleport to you, swipe you off your bike, and kill you. If god forbid you get off the bike to fight them, they'll take 15 shots to the face each before they die, running you completely out of ammo.

There are also way too many ""follow this NPC"" moments that act like glorified cutscenes, but bore you out of your mind by having you walk at a snail's pace or wait for some part of the environment to move. If you skip these, you lose out on important parts of the story, which I would say is the most interesting part of the game.

When the game works the way it implies it should work, the gameplay is satisfying, and the story seems to be pretty good.

Probably... look it probably has some of the best motorcycle driving I've um... ever played in a... in games but THE GAME CAN HAVE, look it can have some repetitive... uh parts... elements to it.

Okay, I'm done typing like that. That was to make fun of just how silly the voice direction in this game can be. Remember how we complained for years about protags being silent? Yeah, Deacon won't ever shut the fuck up, and the excessive vocalized pauses make him sound like he has a legitimate speaking disorder. Moreover, he'll scream his lines during stealth sections, and quietly whisper during bombastic moments. Sam Witwer isn't a bad actor by any means, so I can only really blame the directors for this bizarre voice acting. I know this seems like the most pedantic shit ever to focus on in a review, but it's actually pretty distracting and takes me out of the game because I'm usually laughing at Deacon instead of empathizing with him. The character legitimately comes off as a schizo to me at times.

Otherwise, it's fine. Kinda typical open world affairs but not too grindy or repetitive for me yet. Like I said though, the bike actually feels really good and weighty to drive, outdoing almost every other gaming motorcycle I've driven, which is good, because about a quarter of the game Deacon's ass will be firmly stuck to that bike seat. Combat is okay, like just really okay. Figuring out the approach to a situation (like a bandit camp or zombie horde) is often more fun than actually executing said approach. It also runs really well, but my set up can run Cyberpunk at max, so your mileage may vary. 

Get it on a sale or something. If it doesn't immediately grab your interest though, it's safe to skip because unless the story gets really good then you're not missing out on much.",1697792961,1697792961,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Days Gone is an absolute masterpiece, taking survival horror and open-world gaming to a whole new level. Set in a hauntingly beautiful post-apocalyptic Pacific Northwest, this game delivers an immersive experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The first thing that strikes you is the breathtaking graphics and attention to detail. The world of Days Gone is so realistic that you can almost smell the decay and feel the tension in the air. Whether you're exploring lush forests, abandoned towns, or taking on hordes of terrifying Freakers, the game's visuals are nothing short of stunning.

But Days Gone isn't just about eye candy; it's also a story-driven adventure that's both emotionally engaging and action-packed. You'll step into the shoes of Deacon St. John, a rugged and relatable biker trying to survive in a world overrun by the undead. Deacon's journey, filled with heart-wrenching moments and moral dilemmas, will keep you invested from start to finish.

The gameplay is where Days Gone truly shines. The motorcycle is your lifeline, and it's a blast to ride through the diverse terrain of the open world. Combat is intense, and the AI-driven Freaker hordes will test your tactical skills as you fight for your life. The game's dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add an extra layer of complexity to your strategies.

What sets Days Gone apart is the game's ecosystem, where the Freakers and other factions interact with each other, creating unpredictable scenarios. This world feels alive, and your choices have real consequences, which makes for a truly immersive experience.

Of course, no game is without its flaws, and Days Gone had some minor technical issues upon release. However, the developers have been diligent in addressing these problems through updates.

In conclusion, Days Gone is a gripping, intense, and visually stunning game that offers an epic adventure in a beautifully crafted post-apocalyptic world. If you enjoy immersive storytelling, challenging gameplay, and a touch of horror, this game is a must-play.

And while i'm tempted to pour my heart out about how much i enjoyed my 100 hours of playing this game to near completion, The TLDR is that I implore anyone who likes open world 3rd person shooters with a strong central story to play this game.

Some things i really liked:

-Motorcycle driving, management, and upgrade system. You develop a huge Dependency on your bike as its a central story element and centerpiece to the gameplay. This relationship only deepens as you get to the endgame where the right upgrades can save your life.

-The game world, environment design, lore, and overall presentation. Beautiful Oregon countryside interspersed with post apocalyptic ruin, with a great deal of small and large details that provide world-building without any exposition. Graphics are awesome and at times breathtaking, and I found the overall game world enticing to explore. All of this is backed up by a solid soundtrack, that somehow mixes the themes of dread and isolation of this damned world, the openness and serenity of the landscape that remains, and the grunginess and rebellious tones that hints back to the characters' days now-gone (ha) as former members of a biker gang. Perfectly paired music and game world. Once fully unlocked, the game map is substantially large and loaded with interesting landmarks, camps, ruins, nests, some unique encounters, and more.

-zombie ""freaker"" infestation, encounters, and hordes. The main attraction... though the enemy designs are somewhat lackluster and not super varied. This is made up for in the actual variety of encounters with freakers, as you'll often find yourself in tense encounters - Especially when it comes to fighting the hordes. There is no greater fun than luring a horde to a bandit Camp and watching them all get wiped away while you zoom away on your bike.

-story, specifically for development of its characters. The main characters (deacon, his friend Boozer, and some of the friends deacon knew from before the events in game) have very fleshed out story arcs that lead to a satisfying, albeit mildly cheesy happily ever after-ish ending. Deacon, played by Sam witwer (Darth Maul from the clone wars) has incredible depth for a protagonist and really feels like a fleshed out character. Many have complained that the story is somewhat generic, though i felt that HOW the list of protagonists/antagonists react and change due to the story's events are what actually sold me.

-length. Surprisingly, the game is actually quite lengthy without feeling horribly drawn out. I tend to be the open world player who spends alot of time simply roaming and upgrading rather than playing the missions, but i think that speaks to the world design's strength. There were several ""false"" endings that actually made me think ""no, i dont want it to be ending yet"" that actually felt more like chapters or acts in a play than just story missions. The game is broken up into 3 (arguably 4 with the concluding chapter) that all have their own antagonist, development of the pre-apocalypse, insight into this zombie plague and its origins, and how all the characters you meet came to be who they are now - from who they used to be. 

-Performance. seeing as though this is a PC port from a playstation exclusive... this ran surprisingly well for me with practically no bugs, visual glitches, or any other errors. Played on max settings and never really noticed any framerate drops, even when horde pursuits put literal hundreds of enemies on screen at once. Rarely encountered any other bugs.

Overall, i understand some of the criticism of repetitive gameplay and ""filler"" side content, but when you consider that this is a well written story in a technically impressive, beautiful world with 2 entertaining core mechanics (Motorcycle usage and Horde mechanic)... all made by a relatively small scale Game studio...I'd say this is a holistically GOOD game. It has flaws, but i don't think that takes away from the good experiences that some serious effort and craft went into producing. 

I hope that anyone curious takes the chance to experience this game, as i personally LOVED it, and hope others find the same joy in it that i did.",1634853975,1697667308,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I expected it ot be one of this stupid sandbox games that you roam around the map with out any storyline, one of those games that excite you for the first 15 hours then they bore you to death. Thankfully Days Gone is far far beyond that. It is an AMAZING game. It has the feeling of both The Last of Us and Worldwar-Z movie, it also reminds me of Fallout 3 and Deus Ex Human Revolution at some points.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*] Good albeit somehow cliche storyline
[*] Annoying at times but highly likeable protagonist
[*] Equally likeable NPCS
[*] Amazing graphics
[*] Big open world map
[*] A gameplay that can be approached as you wish: Stealth, Full Guns blazing or Melee
[*] Awesome gameplay mechanics and setting of the game in general
[*] Awesome and easy bike riding travelling around
[*] Awesome soundtrack
[*] In general I am not a zombie horror fan, but I loved this game
[*] Challenging hordes and a ton of enjoyable side-quests
[*] HUGE replayability value, HUGE!
[/list]

Cons:
[*] Only one: There's not going to be a Days Gone 2. And that is a huge disappointment!!

I have finished the main story in about 100 hours and will reset everything and play it once every year from now on.
Invest without fear and enjoy

For me, its engaging as much as The Last of Us Part 1(PC). You play as Deacon St.John who is searching for his loved one. He has a friend that helps him along the way and you're just trying to survive after the world went to chaos. There is a lot to explore in this game, its loads of fun. The weapon system is very fun when you're using some of the skills that has been implemented into the game. You can learn skills along the way that will help you kill hordes of freaks(zombies) and its just very satisfying to head shot a horde of freaks that are chasing you down as you're using the focus skill! Looting and taking out cults not to mention trying to avoid small groups of marauders who will do anything to kill you in an ambush on the roads as you're cruising to a location or just accomplishing a mission! What I don't like about this game, it leaves you on a cliff hanger and THERE IS NO PLAN FOR DAYS GONE 2 and I'm super disappointed! :( However, there's tons to do after you've beaten the game, so if you haven't gotten around to finishing all the horde killing or the marauder camp clearing, then  you'll be able to do just that whenever you're done with the game.

I know that Bend Studio isn't a huge studio so overall, props to them for this game. But I expected a bit more, even if it was released 4 years ago.

First, the pros : 
[list]
[*] Graphics : Not much too say here, they're good enough so that you can enjoy Oregon. The map is standard, with different biomes. It's not revolutionary, but it works.
[*] Gunfights : the gun feeling is enjoyable and quite realistic, I think. It's a lot harder to aim straight when you run, you have a variety of guns and you're free to adapt your gameplay depending on the guns you're carrying, which you can also easily swap.
[*] Story : In my mind, the story is the highlight of the game. It can be a bit slow paced at first, and sometimes a bit predictible, but once you get into it it gets very interesting. The characters are well written, and the writers took their time in building character developments, for the main character as well as the secondary ones. The story is engaging, and it's the main reason I kept playing the game.
[*] Zombies : the way they move, the way the detect you, the hordes (you're gonna shit your pants the first time) can be terrifying if you're too early in the game or even if you don't have enough ammo and materials on you. One zombie is fine, two or three is okay. 4 or more : YOU BETTER RUN BITCH. Very well done.
[/list]

And now, the cons : 
[list]
[*] The bike : I couldn't really decided whether this was a pro or con, but the bike at the beginning is a pain in the ass. Once you start to upgrade it it gets better, but in my opinion you never really enjoy it (the fuel tank capacity is ridiculously small, the speed is capped so you feel like riding a skateboard,...). It gets less annoying after about 20h of gameplay when you start upgrading it significantly. Also I find the driving sensations to be off, but this seems to depend on people.
[*] The sidequests : the sidequests are as boring as the main story is engaging. It's ""go there, free this person"" or ""go there, kill these vagrants"" or ""go there, get this for me"". And also the fact that you have a radio that is just being used to get back to camp for the NPC to tell you what the quest is about drove me NUTS. WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME ON THE RADIO BITCH ?
[*] The animals. In this game, you will find infected animals that can move at the speed of light, attack you without any type of warning and very little possibility to survive if you're not on your bike. It's not a dealbreaker,, but it's annoying as hell.
[*] Character animation and voices. Motion capture was used for Deacon and other characters, but on all the others, OH MY GOD. The first time I met Ada Tucker, I thought she was a screenshot ! Same goes for the survivors that you free : they have no facial expression whatsoever. The voices are also very weird : sometimes the character will almost yell for no reason, and sometimes he will whisper even though he should be speaking loudly. It threw me off several times.
[/list]

Overall, I would give the game a 15/20 that will entertain you for a good 40 hours. It's a well made game for a small studio like Bend, but it lacks a bit of polishing here and there to make it great. I would be happy to play the sequel, if there is one.

The game is not as great as it is portrait and kind of gave me a letdown because of it, the acting most of the time is horribly bad and feels very awkward, it gives of more a vibe trying to be a bad serious zombie action movie then being a world where people truly live in and are scared of what is happening, gameplay is alright it could be more interesting in some places with the trap mechanics and stuff but that is about it.

First strike was the save system that frankly I still don't know how it works. It has a manual save that sometimes it doesn't work, it has an autosave system that will lose you hours of progress and a sleep system for some reason. 

Second strike is the ammo economy. OK, I get it it is a survival game, so you're not carrying tons of bullets. I get it. But it is ridiculous to clear an entire camp of ten fully armed people and have none of them drop ammo. I'm constantly with 5 bullets in the primary weapon and 3 in the secondary. Further more early in the game there is a bow for which you can craft arrows, which is great IF ONLY I could find materials for it. 

Still in the second point, the crafting and the materials are half-baked and feel unjustly punishing. The gas of your motorbike depletes way fast, the durability of some items are joke. I even unlocked the trait to repair melee weapons, but on my first repair, I used all 7 of my scrap to repair a weapon. 

Third strike was a horde of zombies that ganked me out of nowhere when I tried to get the power on in some camp. With 3 bullets, repeated failed stealth attempts and with no way to outrun them (with the unforgiving stamina bar), I had to leave it behind. And then it dawned me how the game from the very start went full punishing on me on every corner. 

The game removes fun from every aspect of its game and that it's biggest flaw. You can't explore with the bike constantly low on gas, you can't take detours, you can't fight with the atrocious ammo and shooting system, you can't run with the stamina bar depleting all the time, you can't invest in the story with all those hindrances and the bad menu system and the storyline systems that I don't know what is their purpose.

Dying Light had almost all of these issues fixed, with a fast parkour system to outrun zombies, rooftops to feel safe, an interesting crafting system with enough materials to experiment, proper (if generic) story that wasn't all over the place. 

I know that reviewers return to this game thinking it had harsh reviews, but this game while it is good at some aspects it is fun in none. May it get bitten by zombie.",1697052644,1697052644,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is actually quite nice (in my opinion). You don't have to grind and can just follow the story, which progresses very good. But sometimes the grind is fun. Unfortunately it gets repetetive after a while.

It is not a tripple A title, some cutscenes fail to create the emotions intended but the characters are still good (though some are edgy)

The best thing: I never felt really safe when travelling the world. This sense of danger is usually lost in other zombie games after you progressed and end up as a one man army. This happens here to an extent, too of course, but Days Gone never gives you the feeling of somebody, who can just do everything unprepared. Never mind how strong you feel, if you meet a horde unprepared you don't ""no problem, I just outrun them in circles, or dodge them""

One thing you will hate: The main character has sometimes the weirdest voice acting totally not fitting into the situation. And he only basically has two catch-phrases when you have to refuel your bike. You have to refuel it very often at the beginning :D

All in all: 3.5 out of 5. I would recommend trying it. You might actually like it :)

This game makes cyberpunk look like dog water.

I played a bunch of side missions but not all.  Took me 65 hours to complete, but there was still more to do.  
I really wish that there was a sequel for this game because I would have bought it for full price.  

Pros
Good Story / Characters
Good / Fun Gameplay
Good graphics

Con
The only con I have for this pc port is I couldn't get a controller to work, no matter what I did.  I'm a controller player and almost never use mouse & keyboard, but for this game, that's what I had to do.  It was still fun, just not used to using a keyboard and mouse for controls.

Other than unable to get controller to work, I have no complaints, this game was a blast.",1696735648,1696735648,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

pros:
- looks really good
- I think the flashbacks were my favorite part since it was emotional, sometimes humorous, and sweet. it had just about everything
- gameplay starts off as decent in the first half, gets better in the second, and amazing towards the last couple hours 

cons:
- there were a couple bugs where I had to reset my game. towards the end of the game, the ground was missing, so i had to close the game and reopen. I wasted a little over 15 minutes redoing the fights. It's a small problem but i'm hoping they would fix it, they might not though
- I personally didn't like the fact that you have to fill your motorcycle with gas, but to make it worse, you start off with a small gas tank, so it feels as if you are refilling your tank after every mission, but about half way through the game, it becomes less of a problem. Sometimes i would be unlucky and run out of gas, and this would lead to wolves attacking me. I think it being luck based seems like my main problem with a small fuel tank
- I think this game could've been a bit shorter. i didn't like the listening missions for o'brian; they could've made less of those missions. some parts of the game seemed as if they didn't really affect the story and could've just been cut completely to make the game shorter. for example, that little girl does something crucial to plot, but i feel they could've cut her mission and replace her moment with something else 

overall:
it's a great game for graphics
slow story, but overall interesting
gameplay forces you to slow down in the beginning of the game, but you eventually become faster as you upgrade

Save the game failing to load the supermarket internals on a horde hunt(part of a storyline mission) and the ending, which required me to restart the game(was falling through the map). Beyond that, no crashes or bugs whatsoever(except when Deacon would move around an interactive object a few times until it ""locked"").

The story is incredible. No wonder the simpleton games journalists were so angry over this game, Last of Us 2 can only dream of being something like this. 

There was one moment with a lesbian romance that felt almost akin to the season 3 of ""Stranger Things"", in which the character was hitting and flirting openly to the lead, and then, in the last 20 minutes of the last episode she becomes lesbian. As if an executive from Netflix came down and told them ""Make someone gay, or else!"".  The same with one of the characters here, she was hitting on Deacon multiple times, then suddenly, save for a few scenes, she becomes lesbian. There were even an almost sex scene with her. Felt off... 

The racial demographic also feels very much like redneck Oregon, and not like downtown or Brooklyn New York or San Francisco. It is what you would expect. 

The graphics are amazing. The rain, and the accumulation of snow, including the footsteps, gives an immersion like no other. 

No insertion of modern day politics, save for a guy who is paranoid about the government and is a good person, but in the end about half of his points were proven true(even Deacon, disapprovingly agrees in some), and the others were just moot, as we are on a zombie apocalypse. 

But the story, the story is incredible. One of the best stories I have seen in decades! 
Bromance, and the quest to find your wife. 

This is what games should strive to be today. It made me feel my own feels! Nobody does that without a good reason! And this made it! Deacon had a code, personality, everyone, from the vet who became a doctor, to a mechanic. You cared for them all. Damsels in distress, and sometimes you were saved by a damsel(something rare these days). Everyone is in the shit, and you help many, and sometimes they help you back. 

Unreal engine is known for being utterly horrible with facial animation. It is as if their facial animations were made by an autist.  There were only a few games that I know of where they did quite alright with it. Like Remnants from the Ashes, Vampyr and now Days Gone. Their eyes are touching.

The game features a compelling protagonist, Deacon St. John(hot), who is a former biker and bounty hunter. He has a gruff charm and a sweet-natured personality, which makes him relatable and sympathetic. He also has a loyal companion, his bike, which is his main mode of transportation and customization. The bike is fun to ride and handle, and it requires maintenance and fuel, which adds to the realism and challenge of the game.

The game also has a stunning and atmospheric setting, which is based on the real-life state of Oregon in the United States. The game showcases the beauty and diversity of nature, with lush forests, snowy mountains, desert plains, and volcanic craters. The game also features dynamic weather and day-night cycles, which affect the gameplay and the environment. For example, rain can make the roads slippery and reduce visibility, while night can make the zombies more aggressive and numerous.

The game also has a thrilling and satisfying combat system, which involves fighting against hordes of zombies, called Freakers, as well as human enemies, such as bandits, cultists, and militia. The game allows the player to use various weapons, such as guns, crossbows, explosives, and melee weapons, as well as stealth tactics, traps, and distractions. The game also rewards the player for exploring the open world and completing missions, which grant experience points, skill points, credits, and trust. These can be used to upgrade the bike, unlock new abilities, buy new equipment, and access new areas.

However, the game is not perfect, and it has some flaws that I did not like. The game has a long and tedious story, which spans over 60 hours of gameplay. The story is often clumsy, clichéd, and unsatisfying, with many plot holes, inconsistencies, and loose ends. The story also has many missions that are repetitive, boring, and frustrating, such as fetching items, escorting characters, clearing camps, or chasing enemies. The story also has many characters that are bland, annoying, or unlikable, such as Sarah St. John (Deacon’s wife), Colonel Garret (the leader of the militia), or Skizzo (a traitor).

The game also has a dreary and uninteresting open world, which lacks originality and diversity. The open world is mostly filled with generic locations, such as gas stations, farms, cabins, or military bases. The open world also has few activities or secrets to discover, such as collectibles or easter eggs. The open world also has many bugs and glitches that affect the gameplay and the graphics. For example, enemies can disappear or spawn out of nowhere; objects can float or clip through walls; textures can pop in or out; sounds can cut off or overlap; frames can drop or freeze.

In conclusion, Days Gone is a game that I liked because it offers a unique and immersive experience of surviving in a post-apocalyptic world. The game features a compelling protagonist (Deacon St. John), a stunning and atmospheric setting (Oregon), and a thrilling and satisfying combat system (Freakers). However, the game also has some flaws that I did not like: a long and tedious story (60 hours), a dreary and uninteresting open world (generic locations), and many bugs and glitches (technical issues). Therefore, I would give the game a score of 7 out of 10, which means good according to my rating scale.

This is my opinion on Days Gone. I hope you find it interesting and helpful. 😊

The start of the game is downright awful. Extremely slow pace, uninteresting story and characters and very sluggish feeling overall. This entire feeling expands into the first two playable areas in the game (2/5), an drags on for way too long. There are no major improvements coming until the third area, where the situation slightly changes for the better, bringing in decent characters, story progression with new weapons and gear. This was the first moment I truly felt the change, and started to like the game for the first time.

After area 3 (3/5), you unlock the last two areas and unlock the ability to get the best weapons and gear. This is the ONLY time where you could feel the huge improvement in progress, which was (for me) about 25-30h in...and that is waaaay too late. While new guns and gear did feel really good, they were introduced in a little too late (about 5-8 hours before the main story ended).

Story felt very prolonged. Too much cut-scenes, too much talking when it was not necessary etc. Random chats and comments were decent, but the whole flow of the story felt way too cinematic. You have no options during the story, so its going to pan out the same way every time. Also, every single story line is predictable. Not a single twist was made, and there was not a single point where something was *mysterious or unexplained, waiting to be revealed later*. You can pretty much guess how every single character is going to end up after listening to him/her for a few minutes. 

Gameplay was very repetitive - scavenge, kill, loot, move to the next mission, repeat. Missions are also very generic - find X, kill X or save X. The only missions that actually let you do things how you wanted to do them are missions near the end of the game when you have to deal with very large hordes.

Speaking of hordes, those are the best thing in the game. Lots of enemies, very dangerous, very fast. They are still mindless and easy to manipulate if you plan out your *kill box* beforehand, or if you prepare a LOT of ammo. Definitely the most fun aspect of the game.

Zombies are very weirdly placed. Variations exist, but hordes never have *stronger* zombies in them. Strong zombies are usually just scattered around the world in places you have to visit, but are VERY rarely seen in the story-lines, which was a huge letdown. I went in expecting *They are Billions* types of zombies, but what I got in the end is the same enemy with different looks and stats. 

Your main travel tool is your bike, that you will upgrade as the game progresses. However, the fast travel and multiple other activities are locked behind your fuel capacity and overall the amount of fuel you have in your bike at the moment. This made scavenging for fuel in the early game a MUST, and made some areas way too long, just because it forces you to constantly go back for gas or risk getting dry in the middle of the road surrounded by enemies. Going back to fuel capacity, you will not be able to upgrade it much until further on in the game, so enjoy long run-backs. 

Melee combat was really...weird. In the early stages, you only have a knife and it does abysmally low damage. Later on, you can craft a one-hit-stick very easily. The weird part of it is, that you cannot get these good things until you successfully find them in the area 4 and 5, or their respectful crafting blueprints.

Range combat was good. Human enemies had horrible aim tho, and rarely felt like a challenge. Sadly, once you pick the difficulty, this cannot be increased...

Overall, a very standard 7/10 zombie/survival game. Lots of minor bugs and glitches, few crashes and reloads, lots of unused content (no eating/drinking mechanic even tho meat and herbs exist, sleeping is useless outside of skipping time, items can`t be disassembled etc.) and overall a very *it was okay* feeling at the end. 

Did it scratch my zombie game itch? It did. But just gently.

I have this game on PS4 and beat it on that platform, but it is such a good game I had to buy it again on steam. This game is a real survival/zombie/rpg gem. I have played them all in the past and sunk thousands of hours into fallout and Skyrim etc. This game is up there on the immersion front and the storytelling. The fact you have to stop and fuel up your bike (and can upgrade your ride) as well as repair your bike, gives you just a hint of how good this game is...after all it's the little things you want in a zombie thriller. If you're being chased by a nasty horde of ""z's"" you might need to check that gas guage. 

The world looks fantastic, and it can get pretty hairy on a night cycle when you're sneaking around and trying to avoid the brain eaters...just what I want in a video game. Something challenging, fun to explore, and characters and a world I can get behind and believe in. Mr. Deacon is a believable character and so are some of the other players in this story (boozer etc).

I definitely recommend this game. As a note to tell you how much I appreciate this game, I had it in my list for a few months now and I was eagerly awaiting Starfield (I'm a huge Bethesda fan)...after only 8 hours on Starfield I uninstalled it and reinstalled this. Within 10 minutes of starting Days Gone, I was reminded how much better of a game this is....I'll go back to Starfield in a year or so after it bakes a little longer.

The only way to ""fix"" it is to load a save going back to when you did not have the quest yet, and then hoping that it doesn't break again. Several years after release, this - and a bunch of other bugs - still isn't fixed, and one of the lead devs has the audacity to bitch about players not being willing to pay full price for it. Well, your fucking game can't even be completed unless you replay parts of it to see if your shitty code decides to wake up and do what it should, you fucking cunt.

And the game is absolutely not worth replaying and regrinding a bunch of stuff just for another coin-toss script trigger. While it's not outright bad, it is largely yet another Ubisoft-style open world game, of which there are dozens at this point, and a bunch of them better than this one. Anyways, if you are still interested, here's a short bit of info:

- as stated, it is a Ubi-style open world game, but it has some of the narrative-focus/move-style elements of modern Sony games, and it does land the cadence of content fairly well, actually - especially in regards to the open world, but a few of the cutscenes and non-interactive narrative focused parts do overstay their welcome. Overall though, the content delivery is surprisingly solid and the game does much better job of respecting the player's time than most other Sony titles or Ubi-style games
- the Horde system with groups of zombies up to several hundred individuals big is awesome, fighting a horde requires some serious preparation and the tools you can use get progressively better throughout the game, but the hordes also grow larger
- speaking about preparation, the game does play pretty heavily into the whole ""surviving and scavenging in a post-apocalyptic world"" and though supplies are fairly abundant in the world, the amount you can carry is fairly limited - perhaps a bit too much as far as ammunition for some guns goes, but it does create a gameplay loop with proper exciting and slower moments and rewards methodical approach
- the economy balance does require some grinding, but the activities in the open world, coupled with quest rewards, are enough to buy everything - if you want to just do the quests, or the main storyline, you will be limited in what guns and bike upgrades you can buy, but not to a degree that would make the game significantly harder - most of the difficulty comes from resource management and tactics, and also...
- bulletsponges, one of the worst aspects of Ubi-style games, are here, and their impact is even worse than most other games of this type because of the very restricted resources you can carry, and by the late stage of the game, there's quests and encounters which consist completely (or almost completely) of bulletsponges, which leads to unnecessarily long scavenging or a forced trip to the base to restock
- the narrative is good, especially in the first 2/3 of the game, but it has inconsistencies and plot-holes (for example, you posses a pretty important set of information, you get told by some person that it is important to them as well and that they really want you to provide more details to them and their associates - and then nobody mentions it ever again), the characters are pretty diverse in their behaviors and attitudes, but they are nearly all unreasonably stubborn and also secretive about things that make no sense just so that later on things happen in a convenient way, and there is a considerable amount of ""modern politics"" forced into the story for absolutely no reason other than it being there - it's still better than MCU writing, by a lot even, but it feels like the writers took some shortcuts, or were forced to, especially towards the end of the game
- graphics are pretty good for the most part, so is the sound, and the soundtrack specifically is very good, but it does not play most of the time which makes this point pretty moot, it runs fairly well with only occasional stutters, but the game is fairly prone - as mentioned at the very beginning - to quests / scripted events breaking and the necessity to restart the game or reload saves, the physics are glitchy enemies just teleport or fly all over the place for some reason, interactions with some objects are broken and/or underbaked - for example, there is a type of open world encounter where enemies set up a rope over a road, and even if you slow down to pretty much a crawl, or touch it while turning/sideways, it throws you off the bike as if you went full speed and hit it head on, etc. 

Anyways, developers can bitch all they want, but this game is not worth its full price - it's obviously unfinished with clearly rushed parts. Was it more polished and priced as an AA game at 30-40USD/EUR, it would have been much better received and worth it. In its current rough state, it's more of a 10-15USD/EUR game - and only if you can tolerate that you will be forced to reload/restart the game semi-regularly.",1696169605,1696169605,False,3,3,0.491965949535369873,0,True,False,False

[h1]""We make the world what it is, by what we do. All of us.""[/h1]

[h1]Introduction:[/h1]
If any of you fellas have been following my Steam reviews for some time now, you might have stumbled upon my profile & in turn seen my list of my all-time favorite games/franchises. The vast majority of them are games that I grew up with in the late 2000s & early 2010s. 2011 is still to me considered the best year for gaming. As such the latest game to have ended up on that list was The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt & that was in 2016, for the next 4 or years no game would end up on that list until 3 very special PlayStation games would capture my heart & spoil me rotten. This is the story of one of them.

Days Gone when it was first announced took people's attention straight away. At first, it might have seemed like another zombie apocalypse survival shooter & you would be right to think that way. Even I did until the developers showed us their magnum opus. The hordes mechanic, something that wasn't possible now became a reality. On your screen, you could battle from up to 100 to even 300 or more fast-moving & furious zombies! Couple that with an addicting gameplay loop, a well-written story, a diverse & expansive world, dynamic characters, & a real difficulty scale & you have the recipe for a perfect game that will be remembered throughout the ages.

[h1]The Story:[/h1]
Days Gone takes place in the post-apocalyptic ruins of the United States. A mysterious Virus has decimated the global population & turned everyone who was infected into ravaging brutes that have come to be known as Freakers. They are kind of like a mix of the Zombies from Train To Busan & the Darkseekers from I Am Legend. They hibernate, migrate, & eat anything they can slay. Any form of governance & order is long gone, what's left of the civilian population has either retreated into makeshift camp forts, turned to bounty hunting & drifting, or turned to banditry & preying on the weak. You play as an ex-US Army Soldier turned Outlaw Biker Deacon St. John, together with his fellow biker brother William ""Boozer"" Gray, They make a living & survive as mercenaries in the ruins of Oregon. Deacon lost his wife Sarah Whitaker at the beginning of the outbreak. Ridden with guilt, he struggles to move on, The two lads plan to head north in search of a better life and to be rid of the ghosts of the past. That is until a black helicopter bearing the NERO Symbolc [b](National Emergency Response Organization)[/b] is sighted by Deacon, NERO was the organization that was meant to save Sarah during the outbreak, with NERO being back, Deacon regains some hope that perhaps his wife might still be alive... Your journey starts here.

[h1]Pros & Cons Summary:[/h1]
I hit the character limit so I’m going to be leaving a Google document where I will have every pro and con of the game summarized. If you are looking for a short but informative review that gets straight to the point then the pros & cons here should explain everything just by reading the name of it. If you are looking for a more detailed reason for each con that I listed then check out the link below that leads to the Google document.---> [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/15U6POpUI_hC_DV9tDbIEAv9fW8FsQqcLWa63D1Fi_q4/edit?usp=sharing]Link[/url]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
When Days Gone was first released, critics & reviewers online blasted this game with tons of hate, needless to say, I was one of the people to buy into their narrative & as such avoided buying Days Gone on launch when it came out, it wasn't until my Uncle borrowed me his copy that I gave it a go after of course, my brother did first & honestly. That was THE LAST TIME I would ever listen to reviews online & critics online because Days Gone is a game made with love & passion, I f*cking love this game! The critics online who are tasteless hacks did Days Gone dirty. This is an underrated game, a downright masterpiece, and a few years from now It will be considered a timeless jewel. I haven't loved and been addicted to a game like this since The Witcher 3 and that was back in 2016. Days Gone is an incredible zombie survival game filled with an actual zombie threat, an incredible story, an expansive world, and an addicting gameplay loop that will keep you coming back for more. Bend Games totally knocked it out of the park when it comes to Days Gone but sadly due to the critics, we likely won't ever see a sequel but that shouldn't be a reason you shouldn't explore this quality game. Very few games nowadays end up in my favorite game list of all time but I am proud to say that Days Gone is one of those games to have earned a spot in my heart and my eternal memory.

I personally enjoyed the story though there are better stories out there, I do enjoy it enough to where I am again wanting to play through it one more time just to cruise around on the bike!

Days Gone unapologetically combines the two, warts and all, and leaves us wondering: Why even bother?

Well, Days Gone turned out to be a brain-eating surprise. I mean that in the best of ways. Hey, a million zombies eat brains – so it must be pretty good. Days Gone kept me hooked for way longer than it had any right to. When I was “done” in terms of what the game had to offer, I wasn’t really done on a personal level. I needed more.

I Found a lot of bugs, my favorite ones are killing a raider on top of a hatch and losing access to the bunker tunnel, the other was the napalm molotov mission where I lost access to everything except for left stick, right stick, left stick click and melee attack. The game runs for too long in Act 3, it felt like a slog and I didn't want to even experience the story anymore, I just wanted it to end.

Game mechanics can be repetitive such as gas refuel, saving hostages, getting health, stamina and focus boosters and nest burning; to name a few. When you save hostages they have annoying dialogue that cannot be skipped so you have to listen to them thanking you over and over again without a way to shut them up, after the first few times it was cool but after the 100th time it gets old and there is no way to just skip this boring dialogue it doesn't add to the story or the character development. Characters feel unreal, I mean that these characters have the shortest fuses that when lit they go ballistic never to recover from their rage ever.

I had a real big issue with flash back scenarios the developer thought it would be amazing to have you play a walking simulator in a flash back sequence, I don't mind flash back sequence just don't force me to walk thought the flash back manually just have a short and sweet cut scene; this is an issue with multiple games I just don't like this type of story telling.

Great game, good fun. Not buggy, that I noticed. Although one time I shot a zombie and it flew up into the sky and disappeared, which was a bug, but only happened once.

Hoard mechanics are quite cool. Being chased by hundred of zombies who want to eat you. I'd never seen that before, and it works well. Having finished the story part of the game, I find myself still wanting to play and fight hoards. Which I consider high praise. I do wish there were more camps to attack and sneak around.

The good
- Non-WOKE story line.  Old style saving the damsel in distress type with main plot line along with sub-plot lines.  The story is very involved.
- The control for the MC is good and fairly standard.  However, once the bike is upgraded, it's a joy to ride.
- Once the MC is upgraded.  Combat is much more fun.
- Horde
- Burning horde 

The bad
- As I said before, it's a pain to ride the bike especially in the beginning.  Fuel tank is tiny and the control is aweful.
- Enemy type is fairly limited  
- Tracking type of mission indicator is hard to see.  
- Out of shape, can't run for long.  In the beginning of the game, the MC gets overwhelmed, it's most likely game over.  
- Game ended with a cliff hanger and a sequel is unlikely to happen.

This is definitely one of my favorite games of all time, and almost certainly on my top 5 favorite singleplayer games of all time. It's one of the best single player experiences out there, but not without its flaws... And here's some.

!!! [[SPOILER WARNING]] !!!

- DATA COLLECTION POLICY. If you have read some of the other reviews, this game's data collection policy is incredibly intrusive. It's to the point where it's practically a keylogger. It's that bad. Turn off your wifi, and block this game on your firewall or something so your data doesn't end up getting sold on the dark web or some shit. This is my biggest gripe with this game.

- Slow pacing. You'll only deal with the same type of zombie for the first half of the game or so, then the game just suddenly picks up pace and rapidly starts introducing new zombies. The overrall pacing of the game is just pretty slow in general, but isn't really a big deal when the game is thoroughly enjoyable throughout. I never found myself BORED while playing this game, even with my gen Z attention span 

- Taking control out of the player's hands. There are many, many instances where you'll be forced to sit and watch a cutscene in order to understand more about what you're doing, the world, and the plot. While it is for the most part interesting and worth a watch, I think the game should've made more attempts to deliver information during gameplay sections, while you're still controlling Deacon. There's also a lot times you'll be forced to walk really slowly which I just found a bit annoying. But these issues are by no means a dealbreaker, just nitpicks.

- Arbitrary limitations. Upon crossing the mountains over to the region in the south, you're locked there. This makes no sense, especially in an open world game. I shouldn't be limited to one half of the map when there's nothing that stops me from going over Thielsen pass back to the north aside from an invisible wall that teleports me back whenever I try going past it. It could've been handled more creatively, maybe by establishing some checkpoint you're not allowed to go through. I just felt like this was annoying.

- Fakeout death. Boozer crashes into the front doors of the wizard mountain fortress and fucking explodes, but then he returns unharmed in a later cutscene. This genuinely had me really sad, until I completed the level and he was revealed to be alive. These developers cannot be playing with my heart like this. 

- The beautiful graphics, lovable characters and well written antagonists, great story, incredible world, fun gameplay, well-designed UI, insanely good tension building, crazy good voice acting and animations, and fucking BOOZER.

Just kinda liked the idea of a post-apocalyptic open world infested with zombie hordes. It did quite surprise me though, with it being much better than any critic or game journo told me.

First of all, the world is amazing, and much bigger than I at first thought. As you progress the story you will unlock more and more locations, which are all varied in their look and feel. You got forests, mountains, dry regions, farmlands, small towns, and frozen wastelands. The lighting, color, and graphic fidelity makes it all look absolutely beautiful at all times.
As for the traversal, it's good. Riding the bike felt pretty satisfying most of the time. Driving had very nice feedback, and and felt very responsive. Though only by the end of the campaign and a little amount of grinding can you fully realize the bike's potential through customization (though it's linear unfortunately)

The combat is not too great. The shooting, although competent, doesn't have that punch I was looking for. It's decent when you're mowing down the hordes, but otherwise it's just weak (if that's the right word) The melee is even worse. The physics just aren't there, so there's barely any feedback from anything really. Just some half-a**ed ragdolls and below average gore mechanics. After weeks of messing around in RDR2, this just felt lacking (though I get that's a pretty high bar). But I must say, the animations and responsiveness of the playable character were pretty neat, though at times pretty slow (same problem with TLOU and RDR2)

The story is not a masterpiece by any stretch, but it has its moments. It's pretty slow, so some people might not like that, which I get, and it does get monotonous at certain points (especially near the end). And by the end when I saw all there was to see I kinda wanted it to be over and done with already. I did start to care about certain characters (my man Boozeman) and the protagonist, but that can't be said about any other ones, [spoiler] except Iron Mike I suppose (RIP) [/spoiler]. At times it felt like the story was rewritten and cut a couple of times, so it made some moments feel incomplete. [spoiler] Especially that ""last"" mission on the wizard island, and scene with the colonel. Bro what the f*** was that? [/spoiler]. In retrospect the story was decent enough for me to carry on and even start caring about the MC, so it does its job.

The map design has ""ubisoft"" written on it, with all the outposts, checkmarks, collectibles and etc. Not that it's inherently bad, but it does it get tedious. The random events aren't done well. They are VERY repetitive and boring. I stopped bothering with them after the first half of the game.
Personally I do enjoy opening up the map bit by bit like in Far Cry, but some may not like that, and that's understandable.

But the zombies are the main thing here. And they are great. Alone these ""freakers"" are pathetically weak and are barely an obstacle, (though some types can be pretty challenging if you're playing on higher difficulty), but in hordes they are truly terrifying, especially in first half of the game. I dreaded every potential encounter with them, and when I did stumble upon their nests, seeing their the filthy and bloody surroundings, hearing their collective moaning and growling in the distance, all of it coupled with a very unnerving and ominous score, it literally made my skin crawl. But like everything, you do get used to it (though they were still making me nervous, even after killing off dozens of them, maybe that's just me). But I do wish there were more bigger hordes like the one from e3 (biggest one in the game btw), since most of them are pretty small, numbering in 150-200.

Overall the game is pretty good. I barely encountered any bugs except that one time it sent me under the map, and I had to reload to an hour long save, which admittedly was annoying. But beyond that, the game runs very smoothly on modern higher-end hardware with very rare hiccups. I had a consistent 100-110 frame rate on maxed settings. Though I must mention that the game is pretty demanding of your system, and gets heated up pretty quickly. Longer your session is the more unstable it gets. For me it was approximately 7-8 hours, so I do not recommend playing longer than that in one sitting.

Anyway, let's wrap this up.

I'd seen a lot around Sony PS ported games being poor and kind of stayed away. I got a lot of enjoyment from Mad Max and quite honestly, I'm a slut for a post apocalyptic openworld romp. Days Gone completely tops that by some distance. And more. 

The storyline is excellent!! You'd think Zombies had been done to death. But the storyline fed almost like a TV show role in my life whilst playing it. Sitting in my pants at night. With the lights out. Me, rum, the open road. 
The characters were strong and how they all came together and linked at various points was cleverly done. Made you feel like part of the community!  The gameplay was solid. Good graphics, nice smooth gameplay. Choice of weapons was low but just right for the landscape and problems requiring them. The bike upgrades were plenty. Oh, and should, I mention, I've got a secret crush on Rikki Patil?! Nah, probably not. I'll remove that bit when I've completed the 1st draft of this review.

St. John, is a likeable hero. Modest, troubled, strong, handsome, moral and interesting. Reminds me of me. But seriously. I didn't realise how lucky I was playing this for the first time.

Overall a great experience.

Graphics and sound design is great. Though I did experience an issue with asset streaming that occurred three-four times which required game restarts (models would be stuck at their lowest quality LOD). The map is huge with neat points of interest scattered throughout it.

Gameplay on hard II started off as very stealth oriented where caution was the name of the game. Tried fighting a Newt with a plank in the first mission and that was the beginning of many deaths. As I leveled up and got better stats, stealth became a suggestion and not being cautious didn't result in instant death every now-and-then. Eventually only the largest hordes would be a challenge and figuring out how to deal with each one is the best part about the game.

One thing I disliked were the frequency of random ambushes by human enemies in the open world. Until their camps are cleared you will constantly be clothes-lined while driving down the road and have your bike destroyed by snipers on trees. I recall killing a sniper on top of a tree, then later coming back and being shot again by a new sniper who is standing over the one I shot earlier.

Deacon's aim is extremely inaccurate long-range unless a scoped weapon is used which is strange considering his military background. There is probably a game design reason for it but at times it felt jarring being sniped by revolvers from very far away while you can barely hit a body shot from the same distance (let alone a headshot). That is taking into account skills that improve accuracy. Having pin-point accuracy wouldn't necessarily be an improvement over this but I wish that accuracy would improve even more be it by skills, standing still and (or) crouched.

Main story and side stories were all pretty interesting and engaging. Though the side jobs got repetitive eventually (bounties, clear camps). Main characters were interesting and the player character (Deacon) despite his past moral ambiguity came to be very likable, his interactions with the other characters were great.

This game seems to collect data quite egregiously from your system, even if one selects the 'limited' data collection option once the game starts for the first time (there is no complete opt-out option in-game). The way this data collection is described by other reviews makes it sound like a keylogger. So if you're worried about that try following these instructions to block the game from accessing the internet: https://www.nexusmods.com/daysgone/mods/480?tab=description

That said I have also read some posts by people way more knowledgeable about this than me that have analyzed the actual activity when the game is running and they have not identified any odd behavior. Personally I chose to block the game from accessing my connection (the game doesn't have multiplayer or other online components anyway).

Read that Sony denied the pitch for the sequel by the developer which is very sad, would love a Days Gone 2 that expands on everything that this game offers and continues Deacon's story.",1695395536,1695449244,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall it got me a little bit, I did spend over 40h in it, but honestly I don't really know why. The story is nothing too great, is as you would expect, for the most part. I see the pitch meeting in my mind, it's the apocalypse, zombies everywhere, BUT WITH BIKERS!! Speaking of that, you can't even drive your motorcycle and hit zombies with a baseball bat at the same time, wth is that? You would think that is a major selling point for this type of game. 
Anyway, going back to the story. It has a lot of points where it could take an unexpected turn and become great, but it never capitalizes. Always goes the route of cliche, or even weird? Characters in this game sometimes react and take decisions very oddly, I keep thinking to myself ""who does that?"". 
Another thing that bothered me with this was the fact that everything is so black and white, everybody you come across outside of the outposts are automatically bad guys, that must be exterminated. I understand it is for the fun of shooting things left and right, but it makes it oversimplified and the story could have used some nuances.
Anyhow, is it something good in this game? I guess. The graphics are ok, performance is fine, not a lot of bugs. I think what kept me going was the fun of shooting stuff in the face, even though at first it's quite hard to go over the boredom, you don't have a lot of weapons, your bike is a piece of crap that drives like a moped and has the gas tank the size of a soda can. It picks up a lot after 15h or so of gameplay, but not a lot of people have that much patience, I even amaze myself for having.",1695394344,1695394344,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This open-world action-adventure game combines a gripping narrative with intense survival elements and hordes of menacing zombies.

The PC port boasts impressive visuals and performance, allowing players to immerse themselves in the hauntingly beautiful landscapes. The story follows Deacon St. John, a gritty biker searching for answers in a world overrun by freakers, the game's twist on zombies. His journey is emotionally charged, and you'll find yourself invested in his quest for closure.

Combat is a standout feature, with dynamic encounters against both human enemies and freaker swarms. The sheer size of these hordes can be breathtaking and heart-pounding. Exploring the vast, decaying world on your motorcycle adds a unique layer of excitement.

Days Gone isn't without its quirks and occasional technical hiccups, but its strengths far outweigh its flaws. If you're a fan of open-world action games with a compelling story and a hefty dose of adrenaline, Days Gone on PC is worth the ride.",1695281386,1695281386,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Days Gone is a work of interactive art that deserves recognition for its immersive, high-quality story and characters, its clever and polished design and its ability to circumvent open-world problems and predict the player's expectations. Like other landmark games, there's a before and there's an after you've played it. 

It leaves a strong, lasting impression, and gives you a truckload of value for the time you invest in it. This game has been the ultimate zombie experience for me, to the point where I don't feel the need to play any other, ever. This is the zombie game I've always wanted, and I got it. Thanks. 

Days Gone works hard to distance itself from the problems found in open-world games, most notably with pacing and UI improvements that go a looooong way in making it an enjoyable experience through and through. 

Fun example: Last thing I did after completing the story was hunting for a Horde, so I could end this with a glorious fight. Bought grenades, crafted some traps, filled the bike saddles with extra ammo and went on my way. On some rolling hills landscape, I found my target. It was a tough fight, explosions and fire everywhere while hundreds of Freaks were running at me. Shot the last one, smiled for a moment, but then I heard a scream. I looked left and saw a SECOND HORDE running down the hills toward me, hundreds of other Freaks, no grenades or traps left, only my trusty spiked bat and auto shotgun. In the end, I won again, and that was one of the most glorious moments I've ever experienced in a video game.  

So I recommend, even if you believe you won't enjoy another open-world. This one stands shoulder to shoulder with the bests, then surpasses them.",1652922760,1695267780,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Beautiful open world with lots of random events and things to discover
- Upgrading your bike and getting better weapons and skills is fun and doesn't feel like a grind
- Good story with likeable characters
- Fighting the hordes is awesome
- Well optimised PC port and beautiful graphics

Cons:
- Relatively slow start with quite a few cut scene interruptions
- Physics bugs in PC version (haven't encountered as many in the Playstaion 4 version)
- Game crashes regularly with overlays enabled (in my case RTSS)
- Deacon talks too much during game play and he comments on almost everything, I've had him talking while quest characters were talking or during the listening of a voice recorder.

I've had a blast with that game, there's little to no political rubbish pushed down your throat and the story though simple is very enjoyable. I completed the game on the Playstation 4 Pro first and then bought it for the PC again. My first play-through on PC was on ""normal"" difficulty and I recommend to play on a higher difficulty if you play with mouse and keyboard, because the game becomes too easy due to the better aiming and together with the ""bullet time"" skill you're just too overpowered, even in the end game.

Update after finishing on difficulty ""Survival 2"":
This difficulty as well as ""Survival"" is not recommended if you are looking for a fun and challenging experience. It felt more like chore since fast travel is disabled and the quests seemed to be given in a way that sends you driving all over the huge map and throws even more ambushes and encounters in your way. That may sounds like an immersive experience, but it's just not fun after a while, because the ambushes repeat themselves too often and have no impact on the game itself. This opinion might be biased due to it having formed after my second play-through, but the ""Survival"" and Survival 2"" difficulty settings basically drag the game-play loop like an old chewing gum, so my recommendation for the best experience would be ""Hard 2"", especially if you're playing with mouse and keyboard. You'll still be doing plenty of fun driving on your bike with fast travel enabled, the combat is still not hard, but challenging in a fun casual way.",1694638551,1695262759,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Total recommendation to Zombie-Fans even though everything after this sounds bad, but I had a great time. Just some thoughts on my ""cons"" so you can tell if you might enjoy this as well.

It markets itself as a zombie open world game and while that is technically true its not a ""sandbox"" game as it might seem from the way its portrayed. Its very story driven and actually quite linear even though you have the whole world to explore. The reason for me saying this is that theres always like 1-3 story missions you need to do to one side mission and just ""exploring"" the open world is really not worth it.

Basically youre a Biker in a Zombie Apocalype but you got a friend thats hurt and a girl thats missing and you need to find them. And the game really wants you to care because theres a cutscene every couple of minutes, theres very little ""free play"" and this can really clog up your enjoyment as you go from one scene to the next and have so many radio calls you sometimes have the game bug out and have you listen to 2-3 at once..... As for the free world you can raid the settlements on the side for supplies like crafting materials but it usually doesnt matter and you just run from mission to mission with going to camp from time to time to stock up on ammo and fuel. Like in the old GTA games, you never know which missions you HAVE to do vs which missions are really side missions.

And: The game is long. Like REALLY long, Its something like 30 hours to beat the main mission with a reasonable amount of side-missions but it felt like 40-50 at a time as you would keep doing the same missions over and over again. I more than once started to play one evening and played missions (!) for 3-5 hours and felt like I got nowhere as the story didnt really advance. This is worse in the beginning by the way.

Now there are only really 5 different types of missions:
1. Go somewhere and sneak to what you need. (very limited sneak capabilities!)
2. Go somewhere and kill all the Zombies (sry freakers!) there and get what you need
3. Go somewhere and kill all the Zombies, then power up a NERO station (find 2 Items) to get what you need
4. Go somewhere and kill all the shooty-back-humans and get what you need (usually with opening a bunker)
5. Go somewhere and kill the horde to get what you need.
And yes, this does get repetitive, especially when you get a new mission and you already feel you have to do at least 3 of the above mentioned to succeed it hurts cause the game draws out it length. It would definitely have been better to have a shorter Story and more (obvious) side missions to keep the pace up.  If im completing the story and I am about to have the main camp attacked or someone I care about murdered I don't care too much about a runaway at the end of the world.

The Story is somewhere between OK to good - Its very predictably and I never though ""ohhh wowwww"" the big reveal about 2/3rds of the game was so obvious it was painful to cringe and the ending you can tell from about 2 hours into the game. HOWEVER there are a few smaller stories in the missions and the voice acting is superb, the characters are quite likable with exceptions so I REALLY wanted to finish the story, as mediocre as it was, and its the main reason I kept going.

The big strength of the game however, is the gameplay. Gunplay feels great. Like not good, great. Every weapon feels distinct, the power-up from upgrading your gun is big enough to not feel ""nice"" but ""wow"" and you have a lot of tools at your disposal to disperse of enemies. Riding is fun and while it gets a bit tiresome at the end, it was great fun for most of the game and the constant side-things happening next to the road kept it interesting.

One downside is that my favorite part by far were the VS HUMAN  fights, meaning when they shoot back as this was well done, the AI works, gunplay is great, strategy matters as much as aiming and its some of the most fun I ever had. But these were easy, like too easy. After a few hours you get a decent pistol, a decent MP and a decent sniper and you will clear most of the human enemies without taking a hit.
One of the worst parts (to me!) is the hordes. I know a lot of people love it. Its not often in a 1st person shooter you get to fight hundreds of enemies at once but these are often hard to unfair and you need to find your ""trick"" to finish them. - I quickly found that the by-far best way to fight them was shooting at the big horde (you always hit since its so many) then drive your bike a bit further and keep doing that. This really took the fun out and since traps seem to only take out 10ish enemies (in opposition to a magazine of the tommy gun which takes like 30-40 enemies) traps arent worth it. Also hordes seem to never pay out meaning after fighting a horde, you have less supplies (which cant be bought but must be scavanged!) and health supplied, need to buy more ammo than you got money. 
Luckily you can skip most of the hordes in the game.

Still consumables are nice and only really replacable by scavanging so this is your incentive for the open world. However its usually not worth it with the exception of healing items (you almost always are full of them anyway) and molotovs (you need them to burn nests and you can never have enough - BUT you wont get enough anyway.) At some point (3rd map) you have to burn like 40ish Nests (which requires a molotov) and finding the ingredients to make 40+ molotovs is just infuriating. I gave up, thankfully it really didnt matter.

One thing that also stood out for me was the atmosphere: Quite often you find yourself low on ammo, low on fuel, somewhere with a lot of Zombies and just trying to survive. At no point in the game do you really feel ""safe"" and you start questioning every shot you take as it basically costs you cold hard cash. I loved this. The great, desperate atmosphere with few, but well-placed jump scares (few enough to be surprising!) and the overlingering desperation made this feel like a true apocalype.

So in the end you have a game with great atmosphere and amazing gunplay, thats unfortunatly quite repetitive with a well-told but predictable story.
Still its one of the best Zombie games I played so far and if I hadnt played it yet, I definitively would play it again. 

Once again: While this sounds negative, I recommend it to anyone that likes these kind of games.",1695160666,1695160666,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What we got instead was a game with semi-coherent/awkward dialogue that at many times won't fit with preceding or succeeding dialogue... Probably because Bend crammed together whatever recorded voice-lines they had despite many of them being meant for different story outcomes. This is seemingly an issue with Days Gone because Bend evidently decided to change directions too late and go linear pretty deep into the development timeline.

What I've mentioned above becomes evident when one notices the following:

- Characters giving you specific instructions in dialogue only to then have the scripting/coding of a relating quest force you to do the opposite (going north was fully possible, but we're instead force back south),

- Characters either being rightfully or randomly hostile within dialogue (telling you to more or less to f*ck off) only to then act in an opposite manner a few sentences later.

There's also the fact that the game has a debug menu that refers to much of the originally planned content pertaining to player choice. There's also references to a cut section of the map which in itself seemed pretty planned out since it had fast travel points for checkpoints and bases along with descriptions of locations.

We're on the other hand actually given a pretty feature-rich world. The game world/map itself is pretty big and still doesn't feel empty, this is mostly due to a pretty well developed set of possible events/encounters that pertain to humans, freakers and animals. How all of this plays out is also affected by time of day along with weather/season.

I hope that Bend goes linear with any sequel to this, that is if they ever do decide to make one... It would have been nice to have a story that were as complete as the in-game world and its itself.

In conclusion:

I'm somewhat content with what I got since I bought it on sale, but I wouldn't recommend others to buy Days Gone at full price.",1692237825,1695158168,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The one genuinely impressive thing about it is the bike riding (update: I've beat the game now and the Horde mechanics are also quite unique and well done).

I cannot describe it in any other way. It's like they're all extremely confused about how they're feeling at any given time. The main character will pant his way through a voice line, and then suddenly he's all calm and zen until oops- he's pissed again. What is even going on? The story follows the same strange pattern.

This ""game"" (which is more entertaining than most films and series today) and its narrative are unmatched in emotion, acting, writing and story. BUT because everyone wants to play multiplayer and live service games now, don't lie you do, this game just went unnoticed completely. This game in a nutshell is what is wrong with games today.

I have never played a game where i know everyone's names, care about the story lines so much, and they finally got open world RIGHT! On one mission to just go clear a camp I got sidetracked, hunted some animals, cleared out some nests, tracked footprints to a hostage, found a horde and took it out... and then after 5 hours I got back to my original mission. This is the epitome of what an open world is supposed to be. Alive.

I'm heartbroken that we'll never get a sequel because... money. But its great fun after all these years still diving into the art book, or listening to the podcast. For a game that apparently bombed it has a massive following, and I know at this point its too late ever get a sequel. EA will buy the rights and in ten years we'll get a remake in unreal 8 with loot boxes and co op and PVP.... yay...

Everyone wants to complain about games being shallow and boring and shit these days, its because we ignored games like this, and had to play the latest multiplayer trend which are just never ending cash machines. 

Single player games will always be superior because they stand the test of time.

The story is fine, not particularly for me but if you like that sorta walking dead daryl biker vibe you might get a kick out of it. The gameplay is decent if pretty standard for an open world mission based game of the ps4 era. The collecting + crafting and skill point mechanics are all pretty shallow. 

I dont know if its just a bad PC port but some of the gameplay and mechanics can be so incredibly janky/buggy, particularly event triggers. Why tf do I start getting mission triggers because I rode past an area for another mission WHILE on a mission to shoot some guy off his bike? Why do some dialogue triggers occur multiple times in the same mission and repeat multiple times and overlap with other unrelated dialogue? A radio conversation triggering half way through an audio log playing or dialogue from a character youre meant to be spying on is annoying and difficult to parse. I had a couple of interactions bug out i assume because their trigger occured at the wrong time. Enemies detecting you from stealth when doing a stealth kill or shooting silenced weapons was inconsistent which made trying stealth on a harder difficulty annoying.

The game is like 30+ hours if you do the main story only,  apparently 60+ all up. I wish they had cut down some of the content, side quests or otherwise, to polish some of the key mechanics because with the exception of hordes which are really fun almost every mechanic is done better and more consistently in other games of similar type from the time.

The zombie genre is a topic beaten to death at this point, and it's hard to stay original and unique while creating a media based on it. Days Gone hits all the marks. The infected are very well thought out, the world has so much to offer, and coming face to face with hordes is fun and exciting. The Story is rich and every character is well written, even the characters who are only there to sell you stuff feel like they have a soul, asking about your day, wishing you safe travels.

It's a little on the easy side, so unless you're looking for an ~80hr cut scene...then I recommend bumping up the difficulty.  I'm not sure how the setting works other than making things harder to kill, but supplies are just too plentiful on the normal setting.

[u][b]Initial Impression:[/b][/u] I have been playing this game for 70hrs+ and still didn't want to leave the keyboard and mouse. The world is breathtaking and very ambient. The world its self will suck you in with how lonely the open road is. You get that feeling of loneliness and desperation when out there. The lighting is dynamic, the sound tracks definitely give you a chilling isolated vibe when on your bike, being on foot will give you absolute silence at times which makes you want to be cautious when out there. Also the sound of folly sound great to the amount sound effects to make the game a bit more real. The story is really entertaining and that something ive been looking forward to.
https://youtu.be/6foYrjblqvo
[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u] The map size is moderate, one can easily cover long distance. The bike mechanics was so good, I rarely even opted for fast travel. The character movement is slow but thats good for me cause it feels real. The game does not force you to grind all the way through the map and also there isnt any level system which makes this a perfect choice for me. Just sit back, relax, enjoy the view, feel the story and go for a ride.

[u][b]Graphics:[/b][/u] One of the best facial animations I have ever seen, every cutscene feels connected to the player. Also the colour contrast, environment details, character details, everything is perfect. The world of Day Gone feels so alive and so detailed. It's got the detail of say The Last of Us but in a huge game world.

[u][b]Open world info:[/b][/u] I love looting and crafting and that's a huge part of Days Gone. You loot enemy bodies as well as environments. From abandoned houses to schools, gas stations, small incorporated towns to farms. The landscape is varied. For instance you can use oil filters for silencers and so on.There are a variety of human enemies that range from cultists who worship the Freakers, gangs and bandits who have their own bikes and bases of operations. Then there's the wildlife like wolves, cougars and bears that stalk the forests, deserts and mountains of Oregon. There's also deer in the game world that can be looted for meat in fact all uninflected animals can be looted for meat. You also can loot berries, herbs and mushrooms that can be used for various purposes. There's also infected ""freaker"" animals too. Runners which are infected wolves are massive and can can keep pace with your bike! There's crows that have large nests and will swoop down from the sky to attack you.  Then there's the Rager  bears(complete with barbed wire and posts stuck in their skin) that are pretty terrifying in their own right. 

[u][b]Zombies:[/b][/u] The best and most terrifying part of Days Gone are the Freakers. They are undead zombies either. They are in fact living humans that are infected and have mutated and sleep in nests during the day and feed at night. There are a variety too that range from basic Freakers to many or variations that I won't spoil. I can't relay the terror you'll feel when you encounter  your first Horde. It brings up a level of terror that will make you want to run in the other direction! They are manageable in small numbers but a horde especially the ones later on composed of hundreds are a different matter entirely!

[u][b]Story:[/b][/u] It has a great storyline, better than most of the games that has been released currently. I've never felt as connected to a character and invested in their story as much as Deacon St.John, and will have this game ingrained in my memory for a long time in a similar way that I do with Red Dead Redemption 2. From beginning to end it is a heartwarming, gut-wrenching and epic story without compare, it's almost like I can feel everything Deacon feels all the way through, his struggles, his frustration, his pain and his joy... It all feels real in a way that no other game does.

[u][b]Message to Devs:[/b][/u] Good job Bend Studio !!! You are all amazing and I can't wait to see what you come up with next. Thank you for making us experience the awesome journey.

[u][b]Final Verdict:[/b][/u] Definitely has a replayable value. Now palying the game in NewGame+ mode and grinding the achievements. 9/10 ez.

I played this game shortly on a friends Playstation right after it came out and thought it was a decent game. Never really gave it a second thought until I saw it on sale recently on Steam. Being in-between games right now, I figured it would give it a try.

This has to be one of my favorite games of all time. Definitely in my top 5 singleplayer games. I grinded this game for 5+ hours a day everyday until I beat it. For as small as the map is, it felt gigantic. The story missions were pretty repetitive, hunt down this person, collect this item, clear this area, but the story was so gripping that I couldn't stop playing. 

Never have I felt so connected to a story, it felt like a movie, and played like a movie. I've seen complaints that there are too many cut-scenes, and frankly I do agree. However, for a first play-through I didn't mind it. If felt like I was the one in control of a thrilling movie. The only thing that ruined some of the immersion is how clunky the gameplay felt with it being a port from Playstation, but once I got used to that I didn't even notice unless there was a game-breaking bug. 

Being from Oregon myself, and spending quite a bit of time in the Crate Lake/Bend area, it was a blast seeing what it would take to survive were there ever an apocalypse in my lifetime.

Overall experience is the best open world zombie game you can get. there are many caveats to this tho. 

it runs amazingly on deck for the most part on medium. when it shines it is the best looking game on deck. the detail in the environments is what amazed me most, the amount of weather dynamics in each region was wondrous to play through without ever suffering performance drops. later in the game many hordes become available and the biggest ones did cause some crashes, but amazingly it was minimal and solved by lowering settings. there are however many problems with pop-in and poor textures. sometimes i would have to return to a location for the relevant characters to activate.

i played the game in semi-short 1.5 hour sessions either each day, or weeks apart. luckily, the story is so simple and surface level that it was like tuning in to a lesser season of the walking dead, with lots of filler and generic characters and plotlines. however, there is lots of love here. performances are earnest and in the main cast superb, and the light storyline made the more original plotlines grab you more. 

the gameplay was mostly very fun. the tropes with tired open world design is here, lists of missions, repeated locations and tasks, etc. the biking part can be brilliant though, when the music kicks in and youre riding along against the view of a gorgeous vista, it really sells the cool factor. the rest of it has been done before, but in the case of a zombie open world game, never quite as good.

i recommend this game to anyone who has the disposable cash to spend on something that starts off generic, and blossoms into something unique, and oddly personal. novel biking gameplay mechanics melded with light survival, traditional open world mechanics and eventually novel horde missions combine to make this world, these characters, and this game surprisingly good. its the perfect example of a game not good enough to be great, but not bad enough to be just good.

Decent for the price, I would compare graphics to latest Mafia game, GTAV or Red Dead Redemption 2. Menus are a bit finicky on PC.

2. Story - 9/10
This is the interesting part of the game, it tells an original zombie movie story, which has original monsters, believable science, characters and lore. I laughed, I cried, etc. This game really should have been a $50,000,000 netflix or HBO series, it really was wasted as a game.

3.  Gameplay 4/10
Repetative, you clear a number of checkpoints which advances a story. The clearance involves shooting zombie mobs, or few people who shoot back. It mostly doesn't deviate from this formula other than the rare fetch quest. The enemy AI is very poor for the zombies, you have a sound bar and if you make sound they will shuffle toward you, if you stop or enter a bush they will forget you existed. It feels like unavoidable encounters, jump scares and raw NPC numbers was increased in order to compensate for this, but it doesn't quite work. Elements of gameplay mirror Red Dead Redemption 2 (the horse is a motorcycle, crafting etc). However RDR2 had a much greater variety of quests, greater number of quests, and was more immersive. The immersivity lacks because many quests could be completed in only a limited number of ways (usually 1), and there is almost no interaction with people, outside of scripted encounters the NPCs are all hostile mobs. At times it felt like the game was originally intended to be much, much, much larger and more developed, but was cut at the last moment leading to cookie-cutter gameplay.

4. Peeve
If you discuss issues with the game in community, they do ban you.

A jogabilidade, ambientação, mundo e npcs são bons. A história é genérica mas acredito que foi bem apresentada.
Além disso acho que vale dividir o jogo em 3 atos onde mudamos de ato conforme mudamos o mapa (As vezes vc irá ficar preso(a) em apenas uma parte. Porém posteriormente poderá visitar os outros pedaços)
Ato I - Norte - É onde vc pode sofrer um pouco, tem que cuidar dos recursos e como vai lidar com certas situações enquanto aprende as mecânicas, comportamentos dos inimigos e timings.
Ato II - Centro - O jogo perde um pouco da dificuldade aqui. Vc já vai entender boa parte das mecânicas.
Ato II - Sul, - Acredito que aqui vc volta a ter que pensar como resolver certos problemas. Devido a dificuldade de certos inimigos ou pela quantidade deles.

But I just can't because there are still numerous bugs in the PC port that make missions borderline impossible without restarting over and over until the bugs go away.

- Angel statue? Contextual climb spot doesn't work... Why did they not make those spots an event you could interact with using a keybind? Why not just give the player a small jump or vault option instead? And people defending this nonsense are delusional because it is one of the biggest constant headaches in the game. Can't throw down a mat and climb over fences. Can't jump over fucking rocks. It's ridiculous.

- Bike will freeze at random and become uninteractible or just not move.

- Several missions won't continue without a specific objective or important component, but you can't leave the mission area, so you have to quit and/or restart the whole mission. Why not just make it so that the player can't start the mission without those key things to begin with...?

Absolutely love this game. If I were able to get past where I'm currently at, it could certainly become one of my favorites ever. Nevertheless, I cannot.

I played the game at max settings for 25 hours without issue, but for some reason it then started to crash. GPU and CPU temps remain normal, stuttering doesn't occur -- it just closes out the game. 

I have spent an inordinate amount of time trying to fix the issue by following all the various articles on the internet, but to no avail.

There is plenty more to do and plenty more things I could of done to change the main story line. I would recommend this game, but not to everyone. If you are looking for a game that you can just pick up to play quickly, I would not recommend it. If you are looking to invest some time into a game that will leave you feeling something at the end, this is it. 

Pros:
+Openish world where you are open to explore and taken the pace of the story into your own hands. (Please note that the story lines in this game are quite linear, however you can still upgrade your character while making small to medium world altering decisions.)
+Story feels rough at first, but it truly feels fleshed out and deserved a second game, or at least a book series. 
+Combat system is rewarding and punishing.
+ Worth the price with the amount of entertainment you can get.
+ Post-apocalyptic world where taking down hordes and groups of zombies has purpose. You can choose to avoid mostly avoid big hordes or take them down and reap the rewards for yourself.
+Open world aspect feels full. Various interactions throughout the open world as you make your travels.
+Which skills you chose can drastically change the course of your game play.
+Replayable. Can continue playing at the end of the main story and carry some trust you gain with locations in the world over into a new game.

Cons:
-It is a grind
-General game play is not the problem (fighting, cut scenes, social interactions, traveling), but gaining tracks through the story lines and gaining trust throughout the world does.
- Some side missions can feel tedious.
-Minor non-game breaking glitches, aside from maybe an interior building not rendering, which was rare.
-Limited affect on the open world, your actions are mostly for yourself, getting resources and leveling up.
-Saving can sometimes be funky. I have been halfway through a side mission, saved and then had to restart it.

Overall, these feels like a fun semi-open world zombie game where the story feels fulfilling and one wanting more. The overall game play is fun, however the game can feel tedious at times and it takes some time to get to know the ""shit"" and how to navigate it. 

Take your fate and good luck with them zombies. 

Spoilers of the game, do not read these:
[spoiler] 
1. There are only two main story line missions that I remember where you have to fight the horde and are both far enough in the game to give you time to do upgrades, 
1b. One horde fight, you have unlimited health for your motorcycle and gas. Ram them zombies. 
2. Gas - except for the first camp, there are gas cans fairly close to each camp. Clearing out the gas stations is still a plus.
3. Your purchased guns will go to your gun locker, but if you drop a gun you picked up before, it won't re-appear into your safe. If you drop a gun you purchased, it'll still exist in your safe. (Correct me if I am wrong on this, I might of been experiencing a glitch?)
4. Some missions limit the space in which you can complete it, but sometimes you need to just lead one group of enemies into another and that is very well possible.
5. Rolling is your friend. Stamina is not.

The amount of brain you need to use to plan out routes for HORDES, etc truly makes you wonder why arent modern games like this. SAWMILL will forever haunt my life. 

This game is AMAZING. Heres why:

PROS:
- The game's score is very emotional and fits perfectly to the story and vibe. 11/10
- Graphics are possibly the best in any game ive played. The atmosphere setting is unparalled. 11/10
- Story is really good. Every character I met was interesting, Rikki is love. Deacon though stoic, has enough emotion in him to keep you invested. Good length of around 30 hours of mainquest and about 50hrs along with side stuff. 9/10
- The force feedback on controllers, even on xbox series X roller is INSANE! you can feel the weight of guns, the feel of reloading individual bullets into your shotgun, your bike travelling over rough surfaces, many more. 20/10
- Gameplay loop is top notch. Guns feel great, loot, crafting, bike management, customization, enemy variety, the HORDES AI, just top notch stuff.  11/10
- Not a lot of talk goes into this, but this game has some of the best UI animations and UI work Ive ever seen, rivalling Star wars Jedi survivor. 11/10
- Perfomance is great. Even at situations where theres Hordes of size>500 running at you, there is no frame drop. 
- Map design is top notch and was lived in and alive. Some areas actually game me goosebumps when exploring. Some outposts felt pretty similar but I dont think I encountered any place that was just copy pasted.9/10
- AI is really good. Pathing, awareness, stealth, detection mechanic are all good. Zombies AI in days gone is better than most NPC AI in 2023 games(uhh Starfield, cp2077,redfall,Immortals of aveum, etc.) 9/10

CONS: (not really)

- Story, whilst good, are rigged with fetch quests. Some can get a bit annoying but these quests are usually interesting as there is some sort of purpose to it and not braindead collect this box for me, wipe someones arse for me so i will let you know the location bullshit like Starfield.
- Some checkpoints and travelling parts felt tedious since you have to travel a lot with the bike. Initial hours of fuel management can get tricky. 
- Zombie wolfs can fuck off. 
- you cant aim for half the game unless you invest into the no recoil perk and you good. 
- Half the perks are useless
- you can handle hordes only in the later parts of the game. this is connected to story but i would have liked to fight them/ have a taste at hordes at some point earlier.(you can stumble on hordes way before, but you will just die. theres nothing you can do)

Bend studios came outta nowhere and dropped this amazing game and really dipped. I dont know about the initial controversies. When i played this game, it offered me no obstacles. 10/10. Would love a sequel or anything from this studio. The amount of love and soul put into this game by Bend studios put many AAA game studios to shame.",1693918404,1693918705,True,4,0,0.560000002384185791,0,True,False,False

Main Story Complete, All Encampment Jobs and Infestations done. May do some horde killing latter. ~35hr to to do, but could obviously take longer or shorter (especially if you don't fail at stealth in some of the missions as badly as me) or skip more or less cut scenes (I skipped about 20% of cutscenes and dialogue, mostly dialogue and Encampment Jobs cutscenes)

Story - Above Average/Good, obviously pacing is somewhat up to the player, the only things I would've liked to see explored more is world building. The scope of all in-game dialogue and backstory isn't expanded upon in any detail. Story has a catharsis (meaning no necessary need for a sequel), but there is room to continue the story. 

Mechanics, its a 3rd person ""RPG"". The RPG elements are not too heavily thrust in your face, don't expect anything nearing TES/Witcher, but its there and more importantly doesn't hinder the game experience most of the time. Survival Elements are present, but on Normal aren't going to come into play that often. Controls can rarely feel sloppy and loose, but it won't happen a lot, mostly because KB+M driving isn't the same as Sticks. Gunplay is average, it won't detract (most of the time) from your experience, but in no way will it add to the experience. And Exploration is not a main feature of this game.

Port Quality, Good, coming from Playstation it plays alright, not amazing, with control support and the bare minimum of functional graphics settings. Game has some PC optimization so mid spec computers have a good chance of a good experience. Graphically won't blow you away. Lighting engine does have issues when transitioning between well light and very dark areas, but that isn't something that happens a lot, sometimes struggles with the flashlight too.

Bugs. Minimal, but there, nothing gamebreaking on my end (bugged quests), had 3 enemies fall through the world, had some wonky physics engine iterations, but nothing like getting launched above the Karman Line by a Giant in Skyrim. 


If you are on the fence about this game, the thing about this game is heavily held up by the story. I think the cutscenes alone can total about 4hr? That may attract some people and dissuade others, but that's up to you.",1693816414,1693871664,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has its fair share of annoyances. It's a rushed,  piss poor Playstation port with more bugs than a Bethesda game. It is bound to piss you off bad at some point; hordes breaking missions, series of ""random"" bad stuff happening in a row, physics engine bugging out, VERY BAD 3D audio, you name it. Had to reload more than a few times to un-fuck the gameplay.  I played this game for 19 hours in 2 days though, great graphics, good atmosphere, great story (so far) and it really delivers on that ""Drifters Life"" theme.

Audio deserves a special shit-shout; effects  are great but even the good old Serious Sam games back in 2000 had better 3D audio; you hear the sound, go towards it, and the Zed that's making the noise isn't there. You hear a Horde, go in the other direction, only to walk right into it. Kinda breaks the Zombie Survival thing when you cant rely on sound to get the jump on them. 

Graphics are great and all, but they could have used some better modeling; Iron Mike's face looks like molten Cheddar, a lot of the zed look pretty much the same with very little variation.

Where proper zombie horde originated from, it really shows off you against hundreds to thousands. The sheer amount of bodies you have plan ammo and traps, nothing else like it.

I rarely make exceptions in reviewing a game before I finish it. But this is one of the few gems that it doesnt take full completion to know its worth from the start.

I remember seeing their cutting edge crowd rendering technology showcase back in the early 2000s. They were seamlessly rendering the biggest and most detailed hordes in zombie gaming, much less for a console. I was really sad it was a playstation exclusive and even considered purchasing one JUST for this game. When it came to pc I was excited but also worried about the quality of the port to pc. Im glad to say its a good port.

This game is like if you took the the ""I am legend"" zombies and put them into ""the last of us"" franchise, made ellie a big bald tattoo riddled funny man biker named boozer, and you gave Joel a steel horse.

So far the story is decent enough I guess. The world design is phenomenal. The bike riding is super fun. Combat feels meaty and fluent with great bullet register feedback and death animations and there are plenty moments of intense adrenaline pounding zombie fighting and evading. Sometimes you can turn a corner to an ""oh shit"" moment. And zombies arent the only threat. Its been the only zombie game to replace ""dying light"" as my favorite zombie game so far.

By the time you see this ill probably have dumped so many hours into this game.

(Kinda spoiler?) My only complaint is that the story wraps up a little too neatly. I would like to have had experienced and explored the topics of loss, grief, sacrifice and hopelessness a little more. It was a bit campy. I think there could have been more payoff if some more bleak themes and more character loss were a bigger archetype and ending note to the game.

Its sad that sony didnt recognize the genius of bend studios/days gone and denied letting them make a sequel. I really hope they realize their mistake and let bend studios revisit this universe before the amazing devs behind it slowly drift apart. 

It has its problems but this is one of the most immersive zombie games I've played. I got it on sale but wouldnt have been disappointed if I had paid full price.

P.S. If you are like me and wanted to play more but in a new way there is new game plus and some cool mods over at nexus mods website to make it feel new again. Most mods use the nexus manager for easy installs, and out of all the games Ive modded this one has been the easiest one to mod manually for the few mods that are not managed automatically with the nexus client.

150 hours and 3 newgame+ difficulty increases later and I dont regret a second of time in this game and still have it on my desktop to boot up from time to time to ride my bike and kill some hordes.",1633226978,1693615789,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

A lot of missions give you the freedom to tackle it any way you want, which is a really nice touch. The story itself is pretty good, but the script and writing isn't the best. Its sorta cringy at times, and a lot of key moments didn't really hit as much as they should have. I did encounter some bugs, not game-breaking but annoying, like I had 2 instances where the floor disappeared during a story mission.  Overall, the game is good, not great, it's definitely fun but it has a lot of flaws which to some may ruin the experience for them.",1693591674,1693591674,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story: Upon loading in, we were in the middle of the apocalypse. No character backstory, no zombie backstory. No character attachments made, didn't really know what was going on. The main character ""Deacon"", had lost his wife and supposedly it was a big part of his character. I was thrust into an environment that made no sense, with no sense of immersion, and it kind of seemed like there was no forethought or extra planning for an intro sequence. 

Game play: Definitely lacking, zombies can kill you incredibly easily, and the children zombies surprisingly aren't much different (on normal difficulty). It would make sense if maybe you got an infection or something?, but no, just them slapping you 5 times kills you. A head bash hardly slows them down. Even if you're a zombie, I'm pretty sure a concussion would effect you. If you use the knife that you spawn with, your character only goes for slashing at the chest, which would do absolutely nothing, and because of this, it takes upwards of 10 seconds to kill a singular zombie, and there's never just one. You can sneak attack zombies, and that's kind of the only way to kill them (unless you're using a melee weapon, or a weapon with a silencer). You also can't pick up crossbow bolts...makes absolutely no sense. There was an enemy settlement about a minute and a half walk away from our safehouse...I'm pretty sure they would raid our safehouse instead of lounging about. All together it felt really poorly put together. There are lots of bullets and medical supplies laying about, so it counteracts some of the issues I brought up earlier, but goes along with my overarching message, poor immersion, not realistic, and overall not a very well put together zombie game, or game in general.

Graphics: Wow...graphics are TERRIBLE. The humans hardly resembled anything I've ever seen before. They honestly kind of looked like aliens, you could tell they worked harder on some face models, like the main character and his friend, but JEEZ the other people were laughably nonhuman. Not to mention I had my graphics on high, and there were little to no details shown. It was just a blurry, and for lack of a better phrase, laughable, mess. 

Listen, if you're looking for something mediocre, go for this. It's not my taste, I was lucky enough to learn all of this while I was still able to refund it, and I'd recommend you not buying it..",1693589482,1693589482,False,3,1,0.430020958185195923,2,True,False,False

From the moment I stepped into the worn shoes of Deacon St. John, I was immersed in a post-apocalyptic world that felt both familiar and yet uniquely its own.

The storytelling in Days Gone is nothing short of exceptional. The intricate relationships between characters, the depth of emotion conveyed, and the unexpected twists kept me hooked throughout my entire playthrough. Deacon's journey from a gritty drifter to a relatable and compelling hero is a testament to the game's excellent character development.

What sets Days Gone apart is its meticulously crafted open world. The Pacific Northwest landscape is not just a backdrop, but a living, breathing entity that plays a vital role in the game. The dynamic weather system, day-night cycle, and diverse environments make every moment feel like an adventure. Whether I was navigating through dense forests, exploring abandoned towns, or racing down the highway on my trusty bike, the world always felt alive and brimming with detail.

Speaking of the bike, the motorcycle mechanics are a stroke of genius. It's not just a means of transportation, but an extension of Deacon himself. Upgrading and customizing my bike became an obsession, as I aimed to make it both functional and reflective of my personal style.

The gameplay in Days Gone offers an exhilarating mix of action, strategy, and survival. Facing off against swarms of Freakers or rival human factions always kept me on my toes, requiring me to adapt my tactics and use the environment to my advantage. The tension of scarcity—be it ammo, resources, or health supplies—added a layer of realism that made every decision count.

What truly elevates Days Gone is its attention to detail. The haunting soundtrack, the ambient sounds of the wilderness, the graffiti telling stories of the past, and the hauntingly beautiful landscapes all contribute to an atmosphere that is immersive beyond compare.

In conclusion, Days Gone is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it receives. It's more than just a game; it's an emotional rollercoaster, an exploration of humanity's resilience, and a testament to the power of storytelling in gaming. If you're looking for an unforgettable experience that will keep you engaged for hours on end, Days Gone is an absolute must-play.",1693543209,1693543209,True,0,0,0.481283396482467651,0,True,False,False

Been struggling for a while to find a decent singleplayer game for a while and when I stumbled across Days Gone, it was on sale and thought why not? So glad I did, but even at full price I recommend this game.

I loved everything from the beautiful scenery, to the brilliant story and to the thrilling gameplay of Days Gone. Story mode will roughly take you around 36 hours but even after you complete it there is plenty more to do, and its not like there's lame optional objectives to get you to 100% completion, each one is fun and challenging! There are enough difficulty options in the game to fit every players gamestyle so to say ""its too easy"" or ""its too hard"" is a lie, it is just you playing the wrong difficulty.

Serious bug. I have met driver issue five times playing this game. The game crashed and DID NOT save. Not happening on any other games. It lose much progress and make me feel very disturbing. 

The plot are poor, not much creative in mission design. Many missions are repeating the same process with a different name.

Poor graphics with lots of bug like the dead bodies do not move and keep a same position. The graphic can lose all details one second ago then recover. 

Reward system are suck. Some epic fight missions require to defeat many enemies give 10000 exp while some mission only have some dialogues can reward 4000 exp. 

Good Side:
Leveling up is easy and neither grindy. Fight against Freaks is great.

I see that it's currently rated Very Positive, but honestly, even that doesn't do this game justice. The voice-acting is some of the best I have ever heard, in any game. The animation is smooth and fluid. The story is a heart-wrenching rollercoaster that'll have you invested as soon as you start making acquaintances, The gameplay and controls are engaging and responsive. It's all top notch stuff. The fact it took two *years* to be freed from the exclusivity deal and released to PC was an absolute travesty. The fact we're not getting a sequel is nothing short of infuriating.

Some people say it's long. Repetitive. Formulaic. But to that, I have this one simple truth: All open world games have repetition, and a formula. Explore, collect, upgrade, repeat. This game has that. The story can be a bit of a slow burn at the start, if you're like me and play cautiously. But personally? I was so lost in the world and the story that I didn't even notice. The hours flew by and I was happy to burn them playing this game. In fact, I'm frankly looking forward to my next playthrough, now that I've had some time to step back, forget certain plot points, and reflect on the game overall.

Do yourself a favour. If you enjoy third person, open-world games, and are looking for a world and story to get sucked into and immersed in, get this game. You won't regret it.",1693179452,1693180359,True,2,0,0.509433984756469727,0,True,False,False

-Türkçe Dil Desteği
-Hikaye anlatımı fena değil ortalama kalitede bir hikayesi
-Mososiklet güzel düşünülmüş
-Açık dünya zombi ve kaos teması güzel düşünülmüş

Olumsuz:
-Ana görev, yan görev ayrımı biraz kafa karıştırıcı daha basit bir anlatım şekli olabilirdi.
-Yan karakterler çok akılda kalıcı kişilikler değiller, bu tarz bir oyunda seneryonun daha çarpıcı yan karakterlerin daha heyecan verici olması gerekirdi.
-Açık dünya mantığı güzel, ancak bu kalitede yapılacak bir oyun için açık dünya biraz boş ve yavan kalmış klişe tek düze ezber bozmayan bir mantığı var
-Aynı şekilde yan görev dizaynı tatmin edici içerikler sunmuyor
-Oyundaki silahlar çok gibi gözükse de bunlara ulaşması göreceli olarak zor ve silahlar çok tahmin edici değiller.

Özetle büyük beklenti içerisine girilmeyerek indirim dönemi türü sevenler için şans verilebilecek bir oyun. Oyun kötü bir oyun değil, ancak bana kendisini çok yarım hissettirdi.

Also the combat is quite dynamic and fluent. You can go stealthy, but you can also go rambo-style, especially after you grow up in power a bit.

The story is kind of... Not great, not terrible, but honestly nothing to write home about. I also don't like the amount of unskippable scenes where you just have to walk around with Sarah and talk about irrelevant stuff... Felt kind of a drag, to be honest. Wish there would be much more focus on the mutants (story-wise) than on the absolute horrendous soap-opera relationship between Deacon and Sarah. 

The visuals are great - I've spent quite some time just sitting on a hill, looking at the starry sky, or watching a lake during the day and listening to the sounds of nature! It's quite realistic and immersible.

The beginning of the game is such a slog and takes a while to get the feel of the game and used to the weird dialogue.  Controls are kinda weird or have the feeling of being heavy. I do like that the open world is not too big and easy to get around. Fighting the hordes was really fun and once you get far enough even on Survival mode II is a cake walk. Once you know the mechanics and get used to the clunky controls its fun. Its also hilarious seeing enemies flying in the air when you shoot them.

Performance wise I was surprised how well it ran being a unreal game. The game i feel is very optimized but i would get some visuals bugs here and there or terrain and objects not fully rendering. I saw very minimal stutter but nothing compared to Callisto Protocol. (i like Callisto Protocol btw).

There was a lot of small details that really help immerse you in the story - your bike and footsteps makes different sounds when riding on different surfaces, you leave footprints in snow, the variety of clothing and person design, the shop owner's unique characters and conversations, and as you kill things in the game the bodies remain there permanently during the rest of your play through. 

I liked the first half of the game more than the second half as far as the story. I honestly expected there to be a bigger game shift as he learned what has happened to Sarah, but I still think the story ramped up and resolved itself nicely. 

I really liked how this game incorporated it's music into the game without being obnoxious or intrusive. Without the music, I think the vibe of this game would have felt very different. It helped keep some of the warmth in a game where you do a lot of gory zombie killing.

Critiques - 
The jobs did get a little repetitive if you try to complete them all, but I also didn't play on hard modes so I suppose I set myself up for things to be easy and potentially boring in that regard. 
It would have been interesting to have to build trust with individuals instead of camps as a whole. This would have allowed you to run errands for multiple people and created more variety than there already was.  I would have preferred that you didn't have to level up trust with camps to purchase things. I always had way too much money compared to what I could buy or wanted to buy. There's certain camps with the best guns and certain camps with the best motorcycle upgrades so in replays it's kind of always going to push to you to choose to build trust fastest with the same camps. They could have scaled down prices as you gained more trust instead of locking items entirely which would still would have provided incentive to build trust (plus having 3 allies to end the game).",1693030534,1693030534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And I even almost shed a tear once or twice. To be honest, I wasn't excited at all about this game. I thought it was just another cookie cutter zombie game. If it hadn't been on sale, I may never have experienced it.

   I found the main character's personality a little annoying and immature at times, (actually a lot of the time) but I guess that means that I was vested in the story. This would be a great limited series or 3 1/2 hr movie. There are a lot of missions to tackle, but they are done in a way that didn't get too monotonous or tedious. Most of the tasks were to go clear out a camp, or go rescue someone from bandits, or go find guy that did something bad. And you could very well get ambushed or sniped off of your bike at about any time while cruising down the road. One thing you might notice tho, it's the same dummy every time during those random encounter rescues. The controls were a touch wonky at times, like trying to jump on my bike wasn't always a seamless operation and can really frustrate you while trying to make a very quick get away. 

  Good graphics, very smooth performance, engaging story, well acted characters with actual personalities blended with enjoyable missions and goals made this a really good time for me. And there seems to be a lot more to do, even after I've finished the main story.

Of course, there is always room for improvement, but overall, the zombie game we want!

It is not as scary as resident evil, or oppressive, which may be a PLUS or a MINUS depending on what you usually enjoy.

Also, I chose the hardest level, and I am an old guy, and still, it is not as hard as it should be. I like how they offer around 5 to 6 difficulty level options (can’t remember now)

These types of games can really make use of these 2 recommendations I have:

Oppression level
-	1- walk in the park
-	5- crap your pants
**Tip for level 5: make the tunnels and dark places much more relevant
Difficulty
-	1- I play games while I study chemistry
-	5- You’ll smash your monitor with your frustrated head

The fact that we are all far crying now with having side stories, etc makes these games more compelling and fun for those who either like to play for weeks or just be done with it and follow the main story line.

Graphics: Stunning in many parts; and once the zombies start hording and chasing you- so much body parts on the screen at once...

Days gone is an amazing game, Oh it is! 
-The story is better than the majority movies that came out after 2020. It is a well detailed story which it will surpass your expectentions.
-The gameplay is so much fun for a single player zombie game. From my point of view it is THE best open world gun zombie game out there until now. The combat is almost like every other zombie game, you go ""boom boom"" or you go ""stealth"" kill them. But for me, the part that i enjoyed most, was the hordes. I loved it.

The only negative thing about this game are the technical issues i encountered.
Looks like the game is wrongly coded, sometimes it stops loading textures, the engine thinks that the Disk is full and it crashes the game.(it closed my whole pc in my experience).  Lucky me it happened only 6-7 times in 55 hours of gameplay. At first i thought of leaving negative review cuz of crashes but after finishing the story i changed my mind because i enjoyed the game a lot. 
I found a ""temporary solution"" to this crash whatsoever, not sure tho.
-I started the game in windowed mode and then changed to bordeless fullscreen
-I made a loop .bat file which copy-paste autosaves to another location.
-I lowered draw distance.

If you remove the technical issues the game is awesome.

I'll come back to a lot of the things other reviews talk about, but one thing that I didn't see enough discussion of is the emotional depth of the characters. So many characters I started out feeling one way about them and as the story unfolded ended up feeling the opposite (for better or worse), even the main character. Bend studio had some really advanced facial tracking mechanisms that I've never seen so well developed throughout the course of any other game. You pick up on how characters are ""feeling"" with small facial cues that we are adapt to in every day life and this adds a new dimension of emotional context to the story line. In a world of video games having weird and unrealistic relationships the relationship between Deacon and Sarah feels very natural and special despite how it lacks a lot of overdone tropes in story heavy games. My first play though took 102 hours (insane!) and I didn't complete everything. It is a very very very slow burn, but it is absolutely worth it. The game mechanics are pretty cool and allow you to play a stealth or shoot em up style with stealth being more of a requirement at some of the more extreme difficulties. I toyed around with some of the extreme difficulties and was pleasantly surprised how life like they were since many stealth or action games feel far flung and still catering to the player on harder settings, but Days Gone doesn't do this in the slightest. Lastly not enough can be said about what it feels like to be running for your life from 500 freakers/zombies at a time, they all are operating independently and  are trying to kill you. I've played a lot of horror and action games, but never have felt so engrossed in the action as when trying to kill a horde of freakers. Definitely not just another zombie game, multiple interviewing plots. pretty good open world, great game mechanics, and a really fun crafting/learning curve",1692681678,1692681678,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

The latter was a weird wireless headset issue with the SteelSeries Arctis 7 which was solved by unplugging the receiver and playing with a different headset (thanks to IcarusV2 on reddit for the help), and the former was me just being silly about [i]where[/i] I play certain games.

Fortunately I was able to play the game, and was treated to a really good game about zombies and survival. Surviving the dangers of zombies, mankind, and my own self. Driven by his mission to find his wife, Deacon sets out and starts a chain of events that would both rock the game's world and stir some emotions. Love, loss, betrayal, this game's got it all.

Things I liked
[list]
[*] The game is gorgeous, with a vast open world full of (natural) life.
[*] The motorbike is not just a means of travel, but a part of you as Deacon. You can go places without it, but you won't last long.
[*] Keeping your motorbike fuelled is also a neat little bit of resource management.
[*] The story, while not the most engaging, was quite a memorable outing in video game fiction.
[*] So many weapons, and you can craft melee weapons which can be devastating.
[*] So many zombies at once. The hordes are not to be trifled with.
[*] The stealth missions are fun.
[*] The crossbow made me feel like Daryl Dixon from TWD.
[*] Even a lot of the side missions were fun to do, and I did feel very compelled to complete most of them.
[/list]

My nitpicks
[list]
[*] Dealing with the hordes was actually my least fun bit of the game. It's a little tedious, but I'll admit it was the conflict of my Serious Sam ""run backwards and shoot"" instinct which doesn't work in a 3rd person action / adventure game. Perhaps I'll go see on YouTube how others played through those bits in the game.
[*] The random encounters in which you can save some civilian NPC's are sometimes so unforgiving in their timing. Even if I notice the marker on the mini-map and immediately try to go to the ? icon I would still be too late to save them.
[*] Deacon sometimes takes his sweet time to get on the motorbike, even when there are hundreds of zombies rushing at him.

It's the little touches that make this game great. The voice cast and animators went all-out on this game, and it shows. Your main character Deacon st. John reacts as people shoot at him, curses and complains when he has to fight zombies, freaks out when in danger. He is not a stand-in for the player, he's the star of a show that's about him and his relationships with others(foremost being his biker buddy Boozer, a real ride-or-die bro) as he recovers from the aftermath of an apocalypse.

I have only two complaints with [i]Days Gone[/i]. One is the slow start. Quite a few abilities should have been something you start with instead of unlocking such as Focus(which lets you slow down time and aim for headshots) and the skill that lets you outline enemies with your batman:arkham-esque find item vision. 

The second is the challenges and requirements to 100% the game. [i]Days Gone[/i] is not a particularly hard game, even on its higher difficulties, but the challenges are really grindy and having to beat the game a second time on a much higher difficulty(even with all your gear in New Game+) was more of a chore than a satisfying swan song to finishing the game.

If you're <2 hours into this game and you have even the slightest feeling of being bored, stop playing and request a refund.  What you get in the first couple hours of this game is the exact same stuff you're going to get for the next 57 hours of the game.  Nothing will change.

The story is unoriginal and predictable.  The love story is overly sentimental as if they were written by someone who has never been in love themselves, but learned about it from fan fiction.  What's worse is that you're forced to watch them.  Watch them walk.  For what must have been the length of a marathon at a half mile an hour.  I'm fairly sure that 58 hours of my 59 hours of playing time is just watching scenes where people have to walk.

The game is repetitive and bland.  I entertained myself by saying ""ooh piece of candy"" every time I picked up a resource.

There comes a point where you keep playing because you think that the game has to be over soon...right.  But it's not.  It just keeps going, the same things over and over.  It's not possible to be held hostage by a video game, but this made me wonder ""...or is it...""

I'm convinced that the developer ask their ten year old nephew for their best idea of a tough guy and Deacon is who that child came up with.  I actually really like the actor who plays Deacon, he's a talented guy who I feel was wasted on such a one-dimensional character.  There were moments, though, when the face acting wowed me.

Two nice things I will say about this game.  The environment is beautiful; it's what caught my attention in the first place.  The motorcycle has the best motorcycle mechanics I've experience in a game.  I usually dread having to use a motorcycle in a game, but this one was actually fun.  If the point of this game was to ride your motorcycle around and look at trees then A+++ they nailed it.  But after a few hours even the motorcycle riding gets tedious, especially when you're on your way to do that same thing you did 20 times before.

This is definitely a game where you can tell some shortcuts were taken, probably due to budget, but they still managed to craft a fantastic game from start to finish. The gunplay and riding around on your motorcycle to explore the world is tons of fun, the enemies feel varied while still feeling fairly grounded in reality, and the lore is a lot more interesting than in most zombie IPs! And oh my lord, the hordes. The hordes in this game are maybe the most fun I've had with zombies since... Left 4 Dead 2? 

Some negatives; 
I came across a fair share of crashes (maybe around 1/5 play sessions I would encounter one), but the game saves often and the load times are good so it didn't bother me too much. 
Also, the save system doesn't save zombies, meaning.it's hard to strategize around hordes.... But maybe that's more realistic? Granted, it is also fun that you're forced to think on the fly in those situations.
Other than that... Deacon can be kinda annoying sometimes? Minor complaint.

The former has a lot of merit, but I feel this blows it out the water. I think the story is great, and it makes you care about whats happening to characters. I also found the story crafting was quote good. You get the story and back story piece-meal. I also find the combat satisfying once you get used to it. A lot of stuff actually, is better once you figure it all out and how the mechanics all work.  Completion at 97hrs, and I still haven't killed all thee hordes in the Southern section, so there is a lot of content. There is a lot attention top detail which I appreciate.

I have 2 complaints. My biggest complaint, which I feel many will disagree, but I seriously hate the leftist ideology being painted through this type of game. Its the end of the world, zombie apocalypse, and they need to think about repopulating the earth, and there are same-sex relationships? I mean get real. It is so incredibly unrealistic (even if the whole premise is unrealistic), but it just feels like it basically had to be inserted essentially to please the stakeholders. This entire ideology enters and permeates gaming like never before and never adds anything meaningful, only an attempt at brainwashing the masses.

Second complaint is the over-use of profanity, particularly the over use of God's name in vain. It was basically in 95% of the conversation. Funny how this only happens with Christ's name, and not with the heads of other religions. I mean, I have seen this used before many times, but this egregious excess of utilising His name in vain, is so noticeable its cringe-worthy. Once I say it and you go play it (or play it again) its pretty hard not to notice it.

Starts slow, with some random NPC missions mixed with the story missions but as soon as you start doing story missions you'll be hooked.

PROS:
+ Amazing story (play the post ending!), very good gameplay

+ Bike progression is really good.
+ Beautiful scenarios.
+ Good sounds.
+ Motion captured (or seems so) voice overs and acting. Pay attention to the NPCs in cutscenes!

CONS:
- The thing that decides spawns is plain dull: if you just keep moving all you'll find is some small random freak groups that you just drive by. If you stop, you get a random rager bear spawning on your back. Also, a trio of screamers after each horde cleaning.
- Did you stop in a random habitable place? Have a random encounter with sudden rogue humans! They wil shoot, the game will warn that it may attract freaks even though it never does. Just shoot!
- Fueling the bike manually is a pain in the ass and you need to watch it.... every. singlle. time. And it gets slower as you progress!
- Plot armor in some part(s) of the story feels just like lazy writting. 
- At the end game, NPCs just go ""hey i lost my cat. Can you find it for me?"" mode with a sudden "" I've marked it on your map."" and proceeds to mark in a maze cave  filled with over 300 stone high freaks.
- You can't jump unless under specific conditions that allow you to climb or jump down. 
- The behaviour of freaks is no different from goombas.

As a lot of people will say, the first few hours are slow and it certainly feels like just another open world/survival/zombie game. But after a while you realise it does something a little different. My biggest complaint of red dead 2 is that the ai is entirely brain-dead and the combat is is a paint by the numbers hoard killer. Ironically, for a game all about killing hoards, this game escapes that trap. In even the shootouts with human enemies, snipers will sit at the back and shoot from cover while people with shotguns and bats will charge you, the guys with assault rifles will lay down suppressing fire and they'll flush you out of cover with molotovs. While I'm not saying the combat is quite as tactical as an out and put tactical shooter, it's better than most third person shooters at this. And that's not the main draw of the game. The zombie hoards are fun to fight, require a bit of a plan and execution and for you to use your entire arsenal. The game is also pretty and runs great on a steam deck. It's not the most original game you'll play but it executes what it does well.

The cast is really good, the standout obviously being Sam Witwer as the protagonist Deacon St. John and ofcause Boozer and Sarah.
Gameplay is overall solid. Riding your bike is so satisfying that I found myself never to have used the fast travel option, especially since the open world is not unnecassarily large and keep revisiting many places and ride on the same path multiple times that you start to learn were best to drift and get faster and faster. Gun play is a little disappointing, shooting full auto is very inaccurate and I mostly kept to single shots to heads.
Hordes provide an actually quite challenging ""minigame"" to the overall story and are damn satisfying to beat.
Butter smooth performance (only some minor ragdoll bugs from time to time, nothing game breaking, no crashes), graphic are solid.
I really like it that the game is not over when you have finished the story.

My biggest issue with the story is the revelation of the leader of the Rippers. When the main character knows who he is, but I am standing there thinking, ""Maybe I missed a cutscene or a conversation?"" It is clear they have a past, but since the game intentionally hides this from you so you will not be able to guess who it might be, it just didn't work for me. The other revelation that Sarah was part of the group who created the virus was so obvious; I do not know why they tried to hide it and make it a plot point. If you are a research scientist in a zombie game, you are pretty much involved.

Only 6 long hours in so far, and I haven't found any of it particularly interesting. Riding a motorbike that guzzles fuel like I do chocolate milkshakes and needs refuelling every 2 minutes, the dull practice of clearing out nests, the so-so practice of clearing out camps, the yawn fest of riding back and forth across the map to carry out another mission that was similar to the last.

NPCs need things done, all the time. Each camp has enough people there, yet they only ever want you to do all the dirty work. You just feel like a gullible sad sack for being pushed around, when they are quite capable of doing a lot of the tasks themselves. So it's basically a game of busy work, but you do get to shoot people and zombies and ride around on a motorbike.

Deacon and Sarah <3[/b]
[quote][b]Rating:[/b] 10/10[/quote]
Throughout my 50 hours of journey, not going to exaggerate, but I got many goosebumps. Those levels of emotion, those emotional music, those tears in the eyes of Deacon, those dialogues and voice, those moments in the story, all of it got me, man. I remember only getting so hooked emotionally to Metro Exodus and Red Dead Redemption 2 in a while, but this was on the romantic love brotherhood kind like Metro but very depressing.

[b]If you wanna feel depressed, sad, connected, invested, and all...DO NOT MISS THIS GAME STORY.[/b]
(Won't impact your real life in any negative way do not worry haha)

I know some people didn't like this game as much because they felt it overstayed its welcome, but for me, it was a great pleasure even grinding side missions on this game. The bike riding and upgrades reminded me of another favourite underrated game Mad Max. Yeah, this was my first Sony game so I may not compare it with other Sony games, but I do have my fair share of experience with many other great games of high production value. This game nails it.

The only downside I found was a few crashes randomly near hordes although I have 32gig RAM but it was offset by frequent auto-saves. Thanks to the dev team because this game runs amazingly on my old 1060.

Large map, new areas keep opening as you progress through the game and think ""surely this will be the last one""

Extensive bike customization. Similarly to the map areas, you just keep getting new customization options as you progress through the game

Bike handling is really good, best I've experienced in any game

Good graphics

Zombies and hordes are fun

Shootouts have this realistic feeling

Good selection of weapons and shooting them feels good

Needing to fill up your bike with gas is nice and a realistic mechanic, gas doesn't last very long especially at the beginning

- It's abundandly clear this is a console port, like so many games nowadays. On the plus side, the game didn't crash within 15 minutes as is often the case. But god do I hate the controls and ...pacing of movement. Even on highest x axis sensitivity, turning around sees you dragging your mouse halfway across your desk. Movements are very sluggish and feel unresponsive, but I suppose this is deliberate (eg Witcher 3's fluid motions to, say, Mass Effects slow execution of movement) just like aim assist and thelike. Couldn't get a feel for how great the Vehicle controls are as WSAD are just on/off switches, but ok, I willingly don't use a controller. Other games still did that better. This feels so very console-gamey in a bad way, in my opinion. From the driving to walking to shooting; all is a tad sluggish and lacks crispness. It feels like a game where you constantly stumble into enemies you can and can't see.
- I did not care at all for the story (and the prologue is all story), dialogues, characters. That's not a good sign; the worst feeling towards these narrative elements one can have is indifference in my opinion, and that's all I felt, and not because the game doesn't really give you a ""why"" to everything in the beginning; plenty of games do this and have me hooked from minute one.
Wish I liked the game better, there might be something for me hidden in there after more time, but my time is too precious to try much more.",1691759071,1691759071,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False

This is my first ever zombie game.
This game puts us in a post-apocalyptic world filled with hordes of zombies. The game's vast and detailed environment, combined with its gripping storyline and well-developed characters, keeps me engaged throughout. The motorcycle-centric gameplay adds an extra layer of excitement, allowing for seamless exploration and thrilling escapes. However, you may find the pacing a bit slow at times. Despite this, the intense combat, survival mechanics, and emotionally-driven narrative make Days Gone a worthwhile and immersive gaming experience.",1690740363,1691754031,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game's core mechanics constantly push players towards scavenging to craft essentials, a task made tedious due to the protagonist's limited carrying capacity for resources and ammunition. This incessant search for crafting materials can feel repetitive and breaks the momentum.

The narrative, although not entirely flawed, fails to stand out or grip the player. The prologue is particularly dreary, with restrictive gameplay elements. Players are often forced to sit through action cutscenes rather than actively participating. And when the gameplay finally unfolds, it mostly revolves around mundane and lackluster tasks. The pop-up progress notifications that can appear out of the blue further disrupt the flow, sometimes intruding during intense action sequences.

One particularly vexing gameplay element is the frailty of melee weapons. It's baffling to see something as robust as an axe breaking after a mere ten strikes. This necessitates yet another tedious search for a replacement weapon, hindering combat fluidity.

Day-to-night transitions in the game are poorly executed. Distinguishing between dusk and genuine nighttime becomes a challenge, often leaving players looking up at the sky to differentiate between the sun and the moon. The lack of an in-game clock or watch further complicates matters.

Interactions with objects, especially cars, can be glitchy. Even when an interaction prompt appears, the action sometimes fails to register unless the player perfectly aligns with the item. Numerous other discomforting elements plague the user experience.

In summation, ""Days Gone"" was a disappointment for me. It's reminiscent of ""God of War"" and ""Horizon"" in gameplay feel, but it lacks the polish and finesse of those titles. Instead of recommending ""Days Gone,"" I'd steer players towards ""7 Days to Die.""

Lots of crafting and harversting but it is just the right balance of simplicity and challenge to keep it interesting and engaging. No endless grinding special components for that special BS item, but everything is worth picking up if you can. Foraging is not only recommended, it is necessary, but it never feels tedious.

Gameplay is great with both stealth and straightforward ass-kicking, with both melee and ranged combat mechanics on point. Limited choice of weapons, but they all feel very different each with their pros and cons.

The bike controls feel a bit weird at first, but they grow on you, and I love the fact that maintaining and upgrading your ride are such big parts of both the gameplay and storyline.

Great story so far (11 hrs into it at the time of writing), with several storylines full of well written characters, with enough mystery to keep you coming back for more. A truly story-driven open world game.

I personally found the porting of the game to the PC to be very poorly done.  The main problem being that a major part of the game involves upgrading and riding a motorbike.  That in itself is not a problem, the problem is that the motorbike cannot be steered with the mouse.  Steering is done with the keyboard, which by definition are on/off switches and so don’t provide the subtlety possible with a mouse.  I did get myself a console controller to see if that would help, but being a died-in-the-wool mouse and keyboard player of several decades I found the learning curve too steep, and life too short to be bothered.

There is also the minor niggle, which seems to be fairly common with console games ported to the PC, that when restoring a save game it is often restored at some point earlier than when the save was made.  As a long-term player on a PC I found this rather peculiar.

This game has a lot of good stuff but sadly there is just an unbelievable amount of frustrating gameplay.

Pros:
- Epic story.
- Great characters.
- Hordes are really impressive.
- Cool gunplay with satisfying headshots. 
- You have a focus meter that when activated slows down time.
- Great graphics and animation.
- Great sound.
- Great world design.

Major cons:
- You cannot drive your bike for two minutes without having to refuel.
- Fast travel is limited by how much fuel you have.
- If you run out of fuel, you're going to have a bad time.
- You cannot drive 30 fucking seconds without some out of nowhere bullshit knocking you off your bike: freaks, snipers, wolves, whatever. No, you do not see them coming. This shit happens so often you are going to say out loud ""fuck this game"".
- All of the above tremendously slows down game progression.
- Close combat with knife takes forever to defeat an enemy.
- Some missions are hard, and if you go in unprepared you are going to have a bad time.
- Better not miss those fucking NERO sites or you're going to have a bad time.
- Close combat weapon has 20(!) hits before it breaks. If you don't repair before that, the weapon is lost and you need to find a new one.
- You can not switch difficulty mid game. I chose hard and I had no way of checking if the bullshit I had to put up with was the difficulty or the game.

Minor cons:
- It can sometimes be hard to find the loot you need.
- I completely missed the point of health/stamina/focus cocktails. I guess they give a boost or something, but I never noticed, and the entire game I was not able to get ingredients for even a single focus cocktail.
- You can not skip end credits.
- Imagine an evil colonel in a post apocalyptic setting running a militia doing leftist virtue signaling in a speech and welcoming transgenders. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ To be fair this is a single incidence in the story but it completely takes out of the experience.

Other notes:
- The music is good except for the few shitty melancholic songs.
- The game is mostly stable. There were a few bugs where I had to restart the game.

Conclusion:
All in all this is definitely an impressive game, and it is really sad to see the frustrating parts ruin the overall enjoyment - of which there is still plenty to be had. Considering the amount of effort that went into this, it feels like it would have been a relatively small thing to fix. If you are prepared to put up with it then I would say give it go. Be warned, your patience will be tested and hopefully it is not as bad on lower difficulties.",1691340657,1691340657,False,1,0,0.456603765487670898,0,True,False,False

I got stuck on the hunting for meat part of the game due to the hoard that kept taking me out. I finally loaded the game back up, got past that part, as I was just making that mission way too complicated than it needed to be. Anyhow, after I pushed passed that part of the game, I was hooked beyond belief, I had to finish it, see where the story was going to go, and when it was all said and done, it made me do something that I rarely do...tear up. Not because it was sad, but because I was so invested into the characters of this game. I've played good games with good stories, but most I forget about shortly after I finish them and load the next game up. Not that they are bad stories, just more ""been there, done that"" type of stories. This wasn't drastically different from any good book or movie, but the execution was excellent to me. The voice acting, the twists and turns, the build-up, all just so incredible to me. I'm sad it's over, but I'm thankful I played it and played it extensively and took my time with it. And...by the looks of it...seems we will be encountering our own apocalypse in the near future that will be, like this game, no accident. Radio Oregon knows what they're talking about.

The story and acting isn’t bad, the voicing could be better, but it’s so damn repetitive. Passing by a zombie nest every 20 seconds? “Gotta finish burning these down!” Refilling your bike that ran out of fuel in those 20 seconds? “I really needed this.” The MC just says the same lines over and over. The story missions have crazy-long cutscenes, then some slow walking, and maybe a fight scene. 

Wanna progress the story? Go to this location and you’re done. Go shoot this guy and you’re done. Cutscene time. Then there’s stealth. They try to advertise it as an option to the player through the o’brian missions, but it’s just painfully difficult to sneak in free roam (especially when there’s zombies near) and not get seen/heard.

In the combat, you’re just slicing and dodging- that’s alright, but the dodging is horrendous. You aren’t just moving out of the way from the enemy, you’re shoulder-rolling 3 meters (wish i was joking) in another direction, probably into another enemy waiting to hit you. 

Honestly, having an actual dodging combat mechanic would have kept me entertained, considering i mostly got this game from its selling point (the motorcycle and open world) and wanting something similar to TLOU.

It is not similar to TLOU. I wouldn’t want to get this game if it’s above $15, and am gonna mod the holy hell out of it to try and have fun.",1691132585,1691132585,False,1,1,0.431034475564956665,0,True,False,False

Days Gone had a rocky start but since the patches this is one of the best games I've ever played.

This game is clever that you really have to listen to your surroundings and not always count on the weapons you have. 
A slow burner of a game that greatly rewards as you progress through the story, and what a long story it is. Every time you think you're nearing the end, it opens up more for you to do!

The fanbase for this game is ever growing. I hope that Sony rethinks on their decision for a sequel.

The environment, immersion and tension are amazing and sometimes blew me away. The way the game handles bike upgrades and gun upgrades is great and hordes are an amazing mechanic which I wish the game introduced you to earlier and more often. The adrenaline rush this game sometimes hits you with is both frightening and thrilling.

However, the game has some issues. Movement is not always as smooth as can be causing some frustrating moments when your life is on the line. Furthermore, audio mechanics are not always great either and can really disrupt your immersion due to voices being unreasonable low in moments where it just does not make sense, sometimes ending a tense moment in disappointment.

However be prepared to be left on a cliffhanger on what happens next in the universe as Days Gone 2 is not confirmed and some time has passed, however there now seems to be hope for the sequel so many of us want. Cliffhanger aside the story is good, if not a bit too repetitive sometimes with the ambush camp and kidnapping stories.

It bothered me less over time, but for a zombie game focusing heavily on vehicles, in this case motorcycles only there is obvious lack of knowledge of the entire mechanical part. The team(s) that made this obviously had no idea what they were doing which is sad, and ruins the game in some ways. Customization was also a bit disappointing, but not bad. While I love that this game focuses on my favorite thing in the world (motorcycles) it is also weird that it's the only vehicle used in the game aside from two small exceptions, but you can't use those anyways. I'd expect cars being used in a zombie apocalypse and not motorcycles. Our character and his best friend are bikers so for them it makes sense. 
 
Anyways overall a 8/10 game for me with the problems it has. More work into this game before release, with some more motorcycle knowledge this score could easily be higher.

Good:
The game has clear mission goals, and you can fast travel to most places.
Combat is pretty fun and you can level up to make it better.
Voice acting and plot/cutscenes are smooth.

Bad:
Weapon ammo is type specific, meaning that green shotgun ammo from the guy you just killed doesn't work with your blue shotgun, etc. It's realistic, but pretty stupid for a game. You always need to buy ammo for your guns, which is cheap later on but annoying at the start. And switching guns often removes all ammo for other guns... and you can't pick up ammo for guns not currently in your inventory. And you can't save guns you pick up; only guns you buy or unlock are available in the gun lockers.

The game saves are inconsistent. During missions, even if you ""save"" you might wind up repeating a lot when loading.

There are several areas where you slow walk, which is pretty annoying in general, but tedious in some cases like following skizzo in the mines (with zero dialogue, just slow walk...)

Other comments:
There are quite a few guns, and the shotguns are fun, but if you actually want effective weapons it's all about the amount of bullets you can throw out. Clip size and rate of fire are all that matter... so the boring guns are what you'll mostly use, unless you like switching guns constantly (losing ammo on the way).

It feels like you need to farm camp xp/credits. If you don't care about getting every item before endgame though, the camp missions will take care of both.",1689278578,1690852384,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Took me 57.2h to 100% a save file.
It will take even longer to get 100% game achievements since you need to complete story on a specific difficulty for it and because there's an extra gamemode.

*Amazing story.
*Characters that don't feel plain. They all have their own personalities and are actually interesting. Some try to restore old humanity and democracy while others turn to raiding and more, which leads to various camps and factions forming, each with their own traits.
*Fun missions. Both main and side quests are fun to do.
*Progress feels very rewarding. You start as a guy running from 10 zombies to willingly chasing hordes of hundreds of zombies.
*Only game I know that has a horde system,  and they did it amazingly. The hordes move at night, each in their specific paths to feed and drink.

Cons: 
- Definitely technical issues on my end not very much but some pop-in, ONLY during cut scenes however.
- An updated Crafting system is necessary as the one in game is a little clunky and weird getting used to.
- You have to get past the first couple hour or so for the game to get going
- Some hordes were bugged even though i eliminated all enemies and i had to load multiple times.

This is a very weak recommend. It's got some good parts, but is unnecessarily bloated and janky, suffer from a slow start and does not stick the landing.

I felt right from the start that the open world game mechanics were kinda whack, the way the character controls, the aiming, the enemy combat animations, the arbitrarily applied restrictions on movement, the repetative side mission structures, the constant continuity errors that occur as the game tries to juggle the non linear progression of multiple simultaneous story lines, the camp trust system, the completely superfluous foraging system, the poorly executed random encounters, the nonsensical wildlife AI, the pointless collectables... I mean, all of it is half borked jank. 

The story started out very slow and meandering, and the characters felt at the same time one dimensional and inconsistent. But something compelled me to keep playing, and towards the mid game, it actually started getting kinda good. The character development started kicking in, and the story actually felt like it was going somewhere. I started appreciating (or at least accepting) some of the mechanics more as I learned how to work around the jank. The bloat was still tedious, and the writing was still shoddy, but character motivations became clear and things were moving in an interesting direction.

Unfortunately, as I opened up the last area, the game hits a turning point where the already spotty story and writing started going south for real. If the characters had been verging on one dimensional and inconsistent before, at this point they just completely fell off the edge. The writing became so juvenile and cringy as the character motivations dissolved into arbitrary contrivance that I just could not care about the characters or their interpersonal drama anymore. It still had a few good moments after this shift, but it got progressively less engaging as it went along, and by the time they rushed for the wrap up, I was kinda thankful that they were rushing it.

The game spent so much time having you run copy pasted errands, only for the ending to feel so rushed and sloppy. Some of the most interesting plot threads, around which a good chunk of the midgame was based, just fizzled out and instead we got the most by the numbers type conclusion possible, cringy ending speech and all. It's a real shame, because it actually felt like it managed to stumble into a kind of Joss Whedon-esque charm with its janky writing and was building up to something good there in the mid game.

I maintain that the game would have benefited immensely from leaving out all of the busy work that they added in just so that they could justify the open world, and tightening up the scope and narrative a bit. I'd say about two thirds of the game could just be done away with, and instead they could have spent their time polishing up the final act. If done right. we'd have an excellent 25 hour game rather than the mixed 80 hour game we got.",1690745470,1690745470,True,2,0,0.514273524284362793,0,True,False,False

It makes no sense and makes the game feel like some bad SoA ripoff, and I was not a fan of SoA.

The characters, and voice acting were very weak imo.  The story somewhat makes up for it but even that definitely has it's own problems.  The zombies are varied and interesting but there are definitely way too many of them just milling around in the middle of nowhere it makes just driving around feel like a chore sometimes, and boy are there chores.  Thank fuck for fast travel and SSD is all I can say about this game.

Engaging Storyline: Days Gone weaves a gripping narrative that keeps players invested from start to finish. The emotional depth of the characters and their relationships adds a layer of authenticity to the post-apocalyptic setting.

Vast Open World: The game's open-world environment is stunning and expansive, offering players a diverse and immersive landscape to explore. From dense forests to desolate highways, every location feels unique and adds to the overall atmosphere.

Dynamic Weather and Day-Night Cycle: The ever-changing weather and day-night cycle create a dynamic and immersive experience. Survival in this unpredictable world becomes a thrilling challenge.

Intense Survival Gameplay: Days Gone captures the essence of survival in a dangerous world. The need to scavenge for resources, manage fuel and ammunition, and strategize against hordes of terrifying Freakers keeps players on their toes.

Motorcycle Customization: Deacon's motorcycle is not just a means of transportation but an extension of his character. The ability to upgrade and customize the bike adds depth to the gameplay and personalizes the journey.

[h1] Dislikes: [/h1]

Technical Issues at Launch: Upon release, Days Gone suffered from some technical glitches and performance problems. However, the development team diligently addressed these issues through updates, improving the overall experience.

Pacing in the Early Game: Some players felt that the game's pacing in the early stages was a bit slow, taking time to build momentum. However, the story and gameplay later pick up, rewarding players with an unforgettable experience.

Repetitive Side Missions: While the main storyline is captivating, some of the side missions may feel repetitive in structure and objectives.

Limited AI Variety: The enemy AI, especially the Freakers, could have been more varied in behavior to provide additional challenges and strategic depth.

In conclusion, Days Gone delivers an enthralling journey through a post-apocalyptic world, combining a compelling storyline, vast open-world exploration, and intense survival gameplay. While it had some initial technical hurdles, the development team's dedication in addressing issues and providing updates has resulted in a polished and memorable gaming experience.

The whole game is amazing, set in a post-apocalyptic setting, Days Gone takes players to a pandemic that has wiped out most of the world's population, turning humans into creatures known as Freakers.

Graphics are the first impression that catches my eye, it is so beautiful, many scenes look like real life scenes. The developer takes advantage of the ambient occlusion technique very well when combined with objects such as rocks or trees, helping to reproduce ""extreme"" scenes, very deep in the surrounding space.

The weather system is also a visual hit in terms of graphics as well as a real-life feel. Effects such as wind, snow and especially rain all have a very clear interaction with the environment of the game screen, creating a very real and cinematic space feeling. Sometimes I thought I was watching a movie instead of playing a game. 
Those who like to be photographers will love the game's Photo Mode, which provides a lot of tools for shooting settings such as angle of view, negative, aperture, etc. game. Perhaps there are few games this year that impress me in terms of graphics like Days Gone brings.

An other impressive point is the number of story-based missions quite a lot. That's not to mention the series of familiar things that you can do in the game's sandbox world such as crafting, collecting materials for this purpose from abandoned houses, or old cars drying in the sun. day and night in the world of the game. Use them to create bandages, Molotovs, bombs or even to repair cars or melee weapons for survival purposes You can drive your bike around the environment, use it to teleport, Quick Save and much more.

During my experience, I felt that Days Gone is a game about driving a motorbike around everywhere, sightseeing, learning more about the main and supporting characters, performing the assigned tasks. It's such a wonderful feeling, the more story i played, the more interesting details and twists, helping me gradually discover a complete picture of how the Freaker disaster happened. It's not a completely new story, but the emotional episodes and the cast of characters in it, with the support of talented voice actors, give the game a depth of content. impressively.

After all, Days Gone offers an engaging open-world survival experience with an unexpected storyline, interesting cast of characters, and extremely impressive graphics. The biggest minus point of the game is probably the plot plot happens quite slowly, requiring players to be patient. Not to mention, the repeating mission system may be a minus point for some players, but in fact, very few open world games on the market can overcome this minus point. The important thing is still the feeling of experience that the game brings and the developer has done a good job of this factor

My playtime: ~45 hours (main story) + 8 hours (100% All side quest) = 53 hours Total

I was expecting a thin, pointless story and a bunch of zombies to kill. This game has several recurring themes in it that are subtle, but are continuously played with and picked apart during story missions. The characters really took me on a ride. I changed my opinion of about half of them as I got to know them. Sometimes I changed my opinion back later. A couple of them even changed my mind about events that took place in the game. In a world where most video game writing make no sense, the characters and dialogue in Days Gone shines above the rest.

Unfortunately, the story doesn't really pick up until you hit the third zone. The first two zones are meant to be somewhat aimless because that's how the character is at this point in the story, but it doesn't come across that way to the player until after they've played latter areas and realized this was intentional (if they ever did). Somewhere in the third zone (where the story/writing picks up) is also the point where you'll probably start to get tired of the game play. 

If there was more depth to the game mechanics and the story was just slightly shorter/more refined, this probably would have been a home run. As it is, I still highly recommend it.",1690594634,1690595778,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros: 
+ the whole concept of maintaining, fueling, and riding around on the bike makes things pretty interesting - it functions as a bit of a mobile base at times and without it, you can get overwhelmed by enemies pretty quickly.

TOP FUN THINGS TO DO:
⭐️ Fighting massive hordes.
⭐️ Upgrading your precious bike.
⭐️ Just being a drifter.

THE UNIQUES:
💎 Running out of fuel is a costly mistake.
💎 Insane amount of enemies in one place.
💎 One of a kind video game.

PLAYER GAMING REQUIREMENTS:
💼 Open World.
💼 Zombies.
💼 Survival.

PROS:
+ Gameplay runs like butter, so smooth!
+ Story is inch perfect.
+ Hordes are so freaking insane!
+ Missions, collections and map layout are perfect.
+ Characters are likeable and enemies have a good reason for fighting.

CONS:
- It's not longer!
- Ran into a bug where insides of the building were empty (Resetting the game fixed this)
- Stealth missions are pretty poor, just go in guns blazing.
- No auto-save when collecting items.
- A horde challenge mode would've been good.

VERDICT:
My word, Sony don't half hire some fine ass developers, what a job they have done to bring the best zombie game out there, it's by far the most enjoyable open-world zombie survival game and there's quite a few out there that fail to the simple things, it's built from the ground up and the end result shone through from all the hard work that was put into this game. 

Us PC gamers really do get the sweetest deals, we had to wait for this one due to it being purely for PS users but a deal has been struck between Sony and Steam which seems to be benefiting all parties, including the gamers! The one thing that shocks me for this franchise, is they won't be making a sequel, the reason behind this was it didn't make enough money. From where i'm standing, the game was an absolute hit and I know a ton of other gamers who would agree with this comment.

Grab this game however way you can, it'll bring you joy and an experience I don't think I've felt before, well worth the asking price!
Total Score = 94/100.

GAMEPLAY:
The game is set in post-apocalyptic Oregon two years after the start of a pandemic that turned a portion of humanity into vicious zombie-like creatures. Former outlaw-turned-drifter Deacon St. John discovers his wife Sarah, having been assumed dead, may still be alive and goes on a quest to find her. 

Days Gone is played from a third-person perspective in which the player can explore an open world environment. Players can use firearms, melee weapons, and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend themselves against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures known as Freakers. A major game mechanic is Deacon's motorcycle, which is used as the player character's main mode of transportation.

If you find a axe, its gone after 10 s of fighting. Ammo is limited to 12-24 bullets depending on the weapon. Why even bother looking for something? Why bother going into that dangerous cave full of zombies if you can't carry the loot there anyway? You can just drive 100 m back to where you came from where respawned containers will give you enough ammo to fill your tiny inventory.  I was hoping for something like Fallout where I could roam around, gather stuff and kill zombies and NPCs as I please. This game is far from it.

Oyun basınından duyduğum olumsuz görüşlerden dolayı oldukça önyargılıydım. En fazla 2 saat denerim beğenmezsen iade ederim diyip aldım ve bu kadar saat sonra oynadıktan sonra oyunun aslından neden beğenilmediğini anlayabiliyorum.

Aslında oyun o kadar kötü değil ancak bir Play Station Exculesive bir oyun olarak yapmaması gereken hatalar yapıldığını düşünüyorum. PS’ye özel bir oyun olarak çıkıyorsanız yapacağınız işin çok iyi temeller üzerine kurulmuş ve iyi cilalanmış olması gerekmekte. Ayrıca oyunun çıkışında olan performans sıkıntılarından dolayı da ekstra kötü oldu. Şu oyun herhangi bir Ubisoft oyunu olarak bütün platformlara çıksaydı bugün bu kadar olumsuz bir tabloyla karşılaşmazdık ve 2. oyunu da beklerdik. 

Yapılan hatalara gelecek olursak; ilk olarak oyundaki açık dünyanın ele alınış biçimi senelerdir oynadığımız ve artık sıkıldığımız tarzda. Haydut kamplarına git, temizle ve ödülü kap gibi gibi. Oyunda bazı kamplarla ilişkilerini yükseltmek için yaptığımız yan görevler de biribirinin aynısı. Git şunu öldür veya sağ olarak yakala. Açık dünya ile alakalı yapılan güzel şeylerden biri zombiler. O zombilerin peşine düştüğü bir sekansta gerçekten diken üstündesiniz. Hele de bir sürüye denk geldiyseniz vay halinize diyeyim ben size. 

Oyunun yetenek ağacında çok gereksiz şeyler var. Hatta bazıları neden var falan diyorsunuz. Yol silah sallanmasını azalt, afetzede görüşünün alanını gelişlet, yok eşyaların ekranda belirme süresini uzat gibi gereksiz şeyler var.

Animasyonlar senaryo cutsceneleri hariç çok özensiz ve bayağı. Bazı oyun içi animasyonlar akıcı değil. Daha doğrusu cilalı değil. 

Şimdi bu kadar olumsuz şeylerden bahsettikten sonra oyunu beğendimi söylesem? Yani 100 lira gibi bir ücrete hiçte fena bir oyun değil. 🙂 Haklarını vermek lazım oyunun zombi istilası senaryosunu atmosferle güzel desteklemişler. Kamptan adım attığınız anda güvende olmadığını hissini çok iyi vermişler. 5-6 zombi aynı anda gelince eliniz ayağınız bir miktar dolaşıyor. Hatta bir sürüye denk geldiyseniz ölüm ekranını görmeniz çok olası.

Zombi istilası konseptini seviyorsanız oynamanızı öneririm. Ancak elit bir deneyim istiyorsanız başka oyunlara bakmanızı tavsiye ederim. Kötü oyun değil ancak PS Exclusive olacak bir oyun kesinlikle değil.

I do recommend this game IF ITS ON SALE.

There is a lot to love about days gone but throughout my play through i struggled to decide if i liked this game or not, and i think i have figured out why.

Days Gone has a lot of ideas, really really cool ones such as the hordes, the biking, exploration, crafting and what not, but i was always feeling that every idea was half baked.

For Instance:
-Hordes: The hordes whilst being visually impressive, don't feel as dangerous or as complex as they should, I never found myself finding interesting ways to efficiently take down a horde compared to me just running and gunning. I also feel like the hordes being stuck to one place (understandably however due to balancing) just ruins the threat of them because i know ill be safe as long as i avoid those areas. A good improvement would be if smaller hordes could be found wandering around the map.

-The Bike: The Motorbike is a critical element to days gone, not only is it essential for survival, but it is also a key character element of Deacon. Or at least its meant to be. I found myself seeing the bike as just a way to get from point a to b rather than a tool i can make use of. The upgrades for the bike are lacking admittedly, as much as i would have liked to see offensive upgrades, non such exsist. The upgrades that are there are just bare bone performance upgrades that i only found myself purchasing for cosmetic and competition reasons rather than a actual need for them (excluding the fuel tank). I feel like this game would have benefited from having bike customisation akin to vehicle customisation from Mad Max.

-Exploration: Whilst the map and scenery of days gone is admittedly gorgeous and there are a lot of interesting looking areas, that's all that they are, good looking. Nearly every building in days gone other than ones used in missions are soulless. There is almost zero environmental story telling which caused me to not be bothered exploring areas that didn't contain an upgrade or something akin. Buildings don't contain secrets you can find or weapons that you can use. Everything looks great but feels empty.

-Crafting: Days Gone has the base of an excellent crafting system, but barely utilises it. 50 percent of the time, an item you pick up is only used in one crafting recipe. The weapon crafting is super cool and is reminiscent of dead rising or dead island/dying light, but it left me wanting more. Another problem is you get multiple crafting recipes for say a baseball modification, however, there is no difference in how crafted weapons operate other than damage, so there is no reason to craft other weapons blueprints than the meta. 

-Combat: Contrary to most reviews criticising the combat. I personally really enjoyed the ranged combat, especially against human enemies, Its simple but effective and is boosted by the surprisingly excellent AI. Its the melee combat which i have a problem with, you would think a game about a biker would have good, in depth melee combat right? wrong. The Melee combat just comes down to attack spam, roll if they dodge an attack and repeat. There are no combos and no environmental combat, and the underutilised weapon crafting doesn't help it at all. A lot of the melee skill points are also rendered useless due to you unlocking 1 - 2 shot melee weapons pretty early on. As much as i hate to reference mad max again, the melee combat is that game, is sorely missed in this one.

Now onto things i did enjoy.

-Story: The story in this game is very underrated. It is understandably not for everyone due to it being a very slow burning and grounded story, but i feel like this allowed me to appreciate every aspect of it. I wont go too much in depth as to avoid spoilers but the only thing i wish was different was the biker elements of the story, its seems like deacons background is brought up only a handful of times and is never properly explored. It would have been nice to have deacon go against rival gangs from before the apocalypse and fight old rivals. That aside the story is very good tho it does require a good amount of time dedication due to its length (It took me 36 hours to complete the main story!)

-Atmosphere: The visuals in days gone are incredible, It seems to perfectly capture the setting its based in and honestly kind of makes the end of the world pretty. From thick forests, to snowy mountains, to dry landscapes, this game has it all. 

Summed up this game is carried by its story and visuals. There is definitely fun to be had in the game play loop but it can quickly grow stale and irrelevant. I cant say days gone is a masterpiece, its far from it. But there is the base of something very very fun. Perhaps Days gone 2 (if it happens) can see the ideas in this game fleshed out, and my lord would that be one hell of a game. 

Final consensus: Mad max but with daryl dixon

Days Gone nailed everything to a T. In Days Gone you have to worry about everything even the wild life trying to kill you and different types of bandits trying to kill you 24-7 setting traps for you to knock you off your bike and kill you. Fighting hordes and trying to set up different ways to kill them added some cool creativity to stacking the kills. i got this game on sale and it was worth every penny hands down.

That being said:
It is nice to play something different from all the woke trash being forced upon us. Although, there were a few moments already that showed a hint of it even in this game. Anytime you criticize freedom its a bad thing. I don't agree with anarchy either but leftist tyranny is no better.

Either way zombies/walkers, male main characters and motorcycles is a nice fit for a game. This series should continue although I don't know the ending yet.
 
My rating as of today is a 7/10. In my 3.2 hours of game play the game crashed 4 times I think. I was streaming so maybe the game doesn't like OBS or something. But I doubt it was something on my end.

Buy it.

I have over 300+ hrs on PS4/5 and have finished the game around 6 times and now I'm on my first PC-run. One playthrough takes around 80 hrs.

To me this game is a 9/10 but I play it so much so it's basically 10/10. If I'm objective I would say it spans from 7-10.
You must judge Days Gone for its budget. Days Gone had a much smaller team than TLOU and HZD. In the last 2 years before release they got help from HZD-devs to finish it up and they scrapped a lot of content and made changes which are the reason some stuff feels unfinished. But it's just minor things really. Hopefully, the mod scene will be able to restore and recreate some of the cut story content. 

+ On PC there's no loading times with a decent SSD.
+ Very scalable so it's playable on potato PCs!
I play it in almost locked 60 fps in 1080p full screen but I set ""Scale"" to ""70"" so it's basically 720p but with HUD in 1080p. The 1080p HUD looks great on my 4K TV so no need for native 4K.  
Graphics setting is custom and low-high on various settings. There's a great metering tool in Graphics Settings that show's in real time how much load the CPU/GPU has, so you can easily set the game to reach a locked targeted framerate  
with an i5 8400 + 1060 3GB  
+ It has full button layout support for A LOT of controllers so you can get the proper button layout
+ Photo Mode is crazy and in PC-version there's an option to capture in up to x8 times the current resolution! However, Photo Mode captures are stored in another folder compared to normal screenshots. And if you use a controller such as DS4 and would like to be able to take fast snapshots you have to set it up to take snapshots with the Share-button somewhere in Steam Settings.
+/- PC-version is a bit easier since you get access to a few upgrades earlier for free. Also you get too keep your mag upgrades in NG+ compared to PS4). 
+ Mod support which I will delve into later. I definitely recommend playing it without mods on your first playthrough.

DEFINITELY play Days Gone with a controller and I recommend the DualShock 4 because:
+ When you ride the bike, you use the analogue L2 and R2-buttons to brake and throttle dynamically which won't work if you play with a keyboard
+ The shooting/difficulty is not that hard compared to other shooters, and the game difficulty was designed for a DS4!  
+ It has better vibration than DualSense IMHO!
+ You can quickly go to map by swiping right on touch pad, check upgrades by swiping down etc. 
+ Make sure to activate Gyro Aiming and set it to a low number to be able to fine-tune aiming when sniping enemies from far!

My 2 extra pro-tips:
1. If you want to know where a nearby enemy is (it must be witihn a certain distance): 
Open Photo Mode > Press R3 on DS4 (sorry don't know KBM-settings) to switch character focus. 
It's good both for knowing where they are, and to take very cool photos! 
2. The shooting in this game might make you frustrated. Never shoot an enemy that is in melee range since the game basically nerfs your gun damage. Be sure to crouch to get more accuracy (smaller reticle), stop moving aim to get smaller reticle (more accuracy), use focus and do only head shots. And don't spray with any weapon, one shot at a time.

I liked the overall vibe, but mechanics were repeatable as heck, writing is kinda meh, because all characters are just plain dumb. Main acting is OK, but open-world directing is awful, there just no smooth transitions. It feels like the Deacon has bipolar disorder or something, because one moment he's screaming on someone on the radio and the other moment there's a new dialog with the same person and he's speaking absolutely calm. Secondary acting is awful. I didn't want to save anyone just to not listen to this horsesh*t of an act. And f*cking merchants do not shut up.

[b]STORY:[/b] Its heavily story based with cut-scenes upon cut-scenes, so if you do not like that you probably won't like the game but the narrative it tells and the whole story in itself is really good. When I first started playing the hook did get me intrigued but the game did seem quite slow to begin with. I was fine with that but i didn't really get into the game until about a 3rd of the way in, in my opinion, that's when the story really became interesting, The characters are surprisingly well thought out and they have lots of flaws which games don't usually show off. You wouldn't say that any of the characters are truly ""good"" people, but that makes you like them even more. I found myself getting really attached to some of the people in the camps and wanted to protect them rather than being forced to through gameplay. The ending has a big twist at the end too which caught me off guard, but I really liked it.

[b]GAMEPLAY:[/b] The gameplay feels good and it doesnt get boring as youre progressing through the game. I like that you can get upgrades for you bike and can get better weapons and also get rewarded for completing the side quests rather than them being there just for lore. I have 100% completed the achievements so I can say the game doesnt have much replayability. In my experience I did enjoy playing through the game a 2nd time to complete ever sidequest and storyline but after that there isnt really much of end game stuff to do. There are a few storylines and loose ends that get tied up but other than that i dont really find any merit or enjoyment out of playing the game more than twice. You do have the challenges to complete but once youve completed them i didnt find much fun in doing them again. 

Overall, the game is very much worth its price, it has a surprisingly good story with atleast 1 good replay of the game. There are different ways to play the game which is rewarding in its own light (E.g. stealth or guns blazing) and each feel well worked and valuable to use in any situation so you can have any kind of playstyle you like. The game gives you a lot of freedom and allows you to complete stuff at your own pace as well as the collectables and lore are great additions to the game. I would highly recommend this hidden gem of a game.",1689702121,1689702121,True,1,0,0.504029154777526855,0,True,False,False

Swing a weapon yourself as hard as you can and you'll see the animations are at least 20-25% too slow even if they were going for more realistic animations. Even games like dark souls which is all about being intentionally clunky has faster melee attack animations than this game.

The weapons also have the durability of wet toilet paper, hell, that's an insult to wet toilet paper. At least you could hit someone with that quite a few times rather than only being able to take down 2-3 zombies with it. This was one of the first things I stopped playing and instantly modded out of the game after the epilogue. I have no idea why game devs do this and it instantly reminded me of Dying Light 2.

I actually did not mind the motorcycle or other controls too much but damn this dude can't aim for ****. Bro, a gun is point, click, shoot. Why are you swaying so much?!?!? This game makes it as hard as possible to be stealthy. The crossbow arrows also have a drop rate that is practically 4-5 times Earth's gravity. The entire point of a crossbow is to give you the same strength as an actual archer without needing to be one. It was essentially like the invention of the gun, it was created and had the function of making it so less training and skill would be required to use the weapon yet, it feels like you're shooting a friggin bow. Just go look at pro-bowmen competitions. They aren't shooting or even angling in the air to hit a target even 75 feet away from them because the arrow has that much velocity. I can go on and on and on about how stupid and how fast these bolts drop. I swear I am also staring at the arrow and it's hitting their head and not counting as a headshot either. The hitbox has to be jacked up.

The skill tree is also not even remotely innovative. I took one look at it and all it does it make the game slightly easier. That's it, and that's all you're going to get from the skill tree. This looks like one of the easiest ""stay at level one and complete the game"" challenges someone could possibly do because the skills are just that meaningless.

I actually don't mind the story or the build up at all. My main gripe is the mechanics of the game are horrible. Hell if I play tested the game for the devs I would have mentioned these things right away and that they needed to fix them for the game to actually be enjoyable. No, this is not dying light where you should be able to swing your weapon willy nilly, but am I some fat dude who can't do anything to save his life? 

Oh and don't even get me STARTED on that god forsaken non-existent stamina bar. Even my fat ** can run for a good 2-3 mins and I have asthma. This dude can only run 5-10 seconds. How the hell is he even still alive? This game is just frustrating to play. I'm not even looking for a power fantasy, just a game that is enjoyable to play and experience. If we take dark souls as another reference, the game itself is actually rather fair most of the time. It's not even frustrating to play you just need to pay attention and adapt. I've never played dark souls and thought ""that was really unfair!"" My thought was almost always, okay, I screwed up, I need to do X here, this enemy is here, etc. Here I feel like I'm playing a tub of lard who can't do jack right and somehow is one of the last survivors in a zombie game.

NARRATIVE

Days Gone is like The Walking Dead the way it should have been made. The first major part of the game has by many been described as ""boring"", but I honestly don't understand what they are talking about? There is a huge shift 2/3 into the story where the narrative ""jumps"" and goes from great to absolutely amazing. This part would not have the impact without the first part.

Days Gone is like a TV-series where you need the background before going forward. 2/3 into the game the narrative is remarkably secretive about what the fu*k happened to the world. You only know it was massive and very, very quick. The first 2/3 of the game is all about surviving in this world and figuring that world out. It is 100% a great way of doing it.

The fact that the game seriously don't spoil anything 40 hours in is amazing. A very unique style and a bold decision.

CHARACTERS

The protagonist is great, has a sense of humor and good friends. Most of the side characters are awesome, and when you get to the various ""Twists"" you really feel for them. There are certain points in this game I find absolutely amazing because of the characters. The writing is so darn good it just hits you like a ton of bricks.

GAMEPLAY

The gameplay is very reminiscent of a mix between
- Far Cry 5
- Horizon Zero Dawn
- FEAR (in a minor way)
- Mad Max

It uses the open world looting, base camp takeover and has its own ""horde"" mechanic which it kind of ""saves"" to later even if you can do them early if your really want. The ammo count feel balanced, the upgrades great and just the number of things to do feel balanced whereas in for instance Far Cry 3 it feels a bit bloated (too many friggin camps in that game).

The mix between shooting, using melee and various items is great - but again there's no real uniqueness to the style, but that is perfectly fine. If you have played the aformentioned games you will feel right at home.

There is a crafting system for the motorcycle which reminds me a lot of Mad Max, but done in a much better way. The general crafting system is really good and I never feel that I have ""too little"" stuff. I like the fact that each camp has its own credit system and uniqueness with motorcycle and weapon upgrades. It means that you can safely upgrade your weapons without fearing that you will run out of money for upgrading your bike.

PERFORMANCE and GRAPHICS

I play this game at Max settings with a 3060Ti. It runs flawlessly, 60 FPS all the way - very similar to Horizon Zero Dawn. It has similar mechanics of ""Stealth"" like hiding in bushes like Horizon. The game looks fantastically beautiful and the locations are very fun to explore - made better with the collectible upgrades and collecting items for crafting.

FLAWS

The upgrade mechanic has one minor flaw which is that items collected and carried double at a specific upgrade point, there are no steps in between like there is with the motorcycle. 

I also don't like that getting that ""level 3"" trust level at camps is so damn hard. It does feel like a game that would be cool in a New Game+ mode (and, yes, there is such a mode). I've done every side quest and didn't reach that point yet in any of the camps.

The bike's fuel tank is severely limited, but gets much better by the end. The fueling tanks don't run out though and always spawn at the same location which is a much better system than in Mad Max. The layers of upgrades for the bike feel very well balanced and I never have too little cash to upgrade, it's all about the ""trust level"" requirement and I never feel bad for buying the rather cheap ammo for the weapons.

There are a bit too few weapons and you can only ""store"" the weapons you buy, not the ones you loot. The good weapons are locked behind the trust level system. This mean that I still only use 2 sets of weapons so far in the game (40 hours in), again I do look forward to a New Game+ just beacause of that. The weapons I have along with the crafting are damn good though and fun to use. 

VERDICT
I'm yet to dive deep into the final part of the game, but damn... this is one good game, one of the top 5 open world games I've played and should be enjoyed by everyone!

The writing is so amazingly good it surpasses any writing of any game I have ever played. The length is great and I will most likely be around the 65h+ mark when all is said and done which is very good value for the €16,49 I paid on Summer Sale.

The fact that IGN/Gamespot gave this game abysmal ratings is F**king travesty. This is one of the best games I have ever played.",1689601371,1689604207,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I feel bad since i have had this game on my library for years but never played for than 30 mins or so of it because it didn't grab me at first. As of now I am about to start a NG+ after doing everything but all of the collectibles. 

Sectional breakdown
Good story IMO, though the ""twists"" are pretty obvious (I know some people don't like it but I really enjoyed the flashbacks, makes you feel for deacon)

Great gunplay, the guns feel great to use and there is nothing quite like mowing through a horde with a tommy gun and a machine gun. My only problem with this is that it feels like some weapons just aren't useful for general gameplay i.e. the m50 reisling is a carbine(?) that is a mix between the m14 and mws and yet isn't as useful as either one from my experience.

World is amazing. Really makes you feel how the world has gone to the proverbial handbasket when you ride at night and almost plow through a horde of 100+ freakers on their way to get water/food, or when you are flying down highway 97 and a runner or a sniper shot rips you off your bike. 

Bugs are minimal, though the ones that happened were game breaking but fixable. At one of the enemy camps there is a pass through a mountain that got blocked by untextured terrain, a similar thing happened in a rescue mission where whenever i would enter the enemy fort I would get trapped by a literal cage of untextured terrain. I fixed both of these by verifying game files, the blocked off tunnel came back a while later but once again I verified game files and it was gone for the rest of my playthrough. I also had the floor not load in one of the last missions, but I fixed that by saving and loading again. I also only had 1 game crash my entire 50 hour playthrough which is pretty solid.

I think the map of this game is just big enough,thankfully, and not overtly a giant empty map like newer AC games. Its your standard third person shooter, cover shoot, roll to dodge. There are many weapons to unlock and bike parts to unlock. The game does a good job to make you choose to upgrade your bike quicker or get better guns quicker. there are different camps with different resources, you can turn in your animal meats and zombie ears to camps for resources. Riding the bike is a fun feature in my opinion, it never feels too boring, I do wish there were radio music or some form of audio to hear while driving. The infected in this game are pretty basic, you will usually just see the regular infected, there are different kinds but I hardly ever saw them. There are nests which have hordes of infected and can be troublesome if you try attacking without a plan. Even after beating the main story line you can still play the game, which is  a plus. There is also a  new game plus mode which really makes you feel overpowered this time around. The character of Deacon is pretty bland but at the same time believable.

It's a mix of Mad Max and World War Z with even a dash of The Last of Us. 

If you're reading this and those reviews, chances are you're wondering if this game is really for you, so I'll start by naming the negatives, if any of those are deal breakers, you may want to pass.

-Story is poorly told. It's not that it's a bad story, it's just so poorly told that sometimes you kinda laugh it off. Thankfully, it eventually picks up. But at first, I thought it was gonna stay awkward the whole game long. Not to mention how few characters manage to keep your attention. Even the protagonist seems to be completely oblivious to the fact he's screaming his head off half the time. It can and will break immersion. 

-Early on, the game will feel like you're out of everything and barely getting by. While later on, you'll feel like you could take on an army on your own. The early game can turn off impatient players and the endgame may turn off players that liked the survival aspect of the game. But if you can stick it out, you may find yourself enjoying the ever increasing challenges.

-The bike is both a pro and a con. I did enjoy having the option to fast travel, save anywhere I wanted, and to carry extra ammo on it. I did NOT, however, enjoy forgetting the refuel and ''walk'' my bike for 15 minutes, but you know, I should have filled my tank up.

The pros; well it's everything else. 
-The gun play is good and feels right, though I gotta admit it seemed that the reloading key did not always register.

-The bike controls feels right. Kissing a tree at full speed does not.

-The exploration is rewarding enough, from recovering permanent upgrades, finding survivors and sending them to camps for big trust points.

-Graphics are nice. Like MG V nice but with lots of greens. You'll see enough variety in the landscapes that it'll never feel repetitive. Weather will also have a decent effect on how everything looks, and unless I'm nuts, I'm pretty sure that the roads every so slightly change as you progress through the story.

-Hordes are also... ''nice''. Why were they not introduced earlier on in the game is a mystery to me. It's a major part of the game and some players must have lost interest of 2/3 of the people by that point.

Get it on sale if you're not sure.

It would be a god damn shame if this game doesn't get a sequel. This game feels like ""I am Legend"" (The Book) meets World War Z. Quickly and surprisingly became very invested in the story and loved the characters, specially Boozer (Lets face it half the game is a Boozer Tomogachi game). 
The camp trust system, buying and upgrading guns, the BIKE god this game made me fall ever more in love with motorcyles and want a bike IRL so much more than I already did. Upgrading the bike throughout the game was such a good game play loop. Facing the big hordes and wiping them out is such a blood pumping rush. How camp leaders would CREAM their pants when Deek ever used the word ""OUR"" camp or people. Fuckin JACK THE PUPPY. 

I love Sam Witwer and game studies should stop cock blocking his characters sequels after such interesting sequel bait such as the NERO secret ending! (Star Killer/Galen Marek fans will also be similarly infuriated after the ending of TheForceUnleashed2 and NO TFU3)

ill be honest, im not the biggest fan of driving around in post apocalyptic usa on a motorcycle, but the game itself is absolutely phenomenal. maybe its because i love post apocalyptic content or maybe this really is one of the best games ever made. i am surprised there isnt a movie or tv show for this game. im also not the biggest fan of zombies, but thats pretty much what comes with post apocalyptic games these days.

i do have one thing that i simply do not like about the game. that is how the missions are setup. there is no real direction on what should be done next. there is no clear indicator to differentiate main missions and side missions. i have played games since the days of the atari 2600 (im in my mid 40s) and this game has probably the worst mission direction that i can remember ever playing. 

other than that one thing this game is an a+ but only on days that end in a y.

must have for any player that loves story driven content, open world post apocalyptic games this game is for you.

While it isn´t anything new we never seen before it is combination to dream of. Cutscenes felt like watching well done movie and few scenes where I riding while music was playing made me shiver. Music choice is spot on. Bike mechanic while not super realistic are fantastic and It´s joy to ride around just for sake of riding. And when I finish all hordes and there´s nothing to do I will still play the game from scratch or just cruise around. Because it is that good in my opinion. I hope they make Days Gone 2 because it deserves sequel. This game Is in my top 10 off all times and I´ve played some incredible games. Easily recommended to anyone who even remotely enjoyed sons of anarchy or the walking dead. To all developers all i can say thank you for this incredible game.",1689295915,1689299869,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

also why is the interlude of the sky fast-time-passing do the clouds remain in the same place? wouldnt the lapse video looks so much better if they moved along even faster than the sky? i think so.

the animations and immersion is really good, the characters are deep, even thou boozer pisses me off sometimes. the story, the traveling, the main char is really interesting and his struggle with Sarah. maybe i should play single player games more often. this has really captivated me, like i wasn't in 15 years. well done.

Days Gone captivated me in a way that only a few games ever have. Was it perfect? No. Was it near perfect? Yes. If I had a complaint then that complaint would be that the story dragged on a little too much in the latter half of the game. Other than that I had a very fun experience that lasted over 30 hours.

Great PC port from Sony, runs extremely well and smooth with lots of options for customising the experience on PC. If you like zombies and open world games with some crafting/scavenging/survival elements then this is an adventure worth having. The main character isn't great, but overall I don't mind the story too much, even with some of the biker stereotypes which I usually don't care for. It is good enough, nothing incredible, but definitely enough to be interested in seeing how things play out.

Gameplay is really where this game can shine at times though. Hordes of zombies. Fixing up your bike + finding fuel for it. Stealth approach vs. humans is very possible. AI is ""not terrible"". Lots of good set pieces as well as emergent gameplay moments where everything comes together perfectly. 

The setting is also an extremely beautiful world, taking place in the Pacific Northwest / Oregon, it is not the most typical place for zombie games but it suits this one perfectly. The developers and art team really did a fantastic job with the world. One of the better open worlds I have played in.

I'm not so sure this game was worth the full asking price on release, probably for some people. I am only 7 hours in at this point but it feels like the game is finally ""coming into its own"" now. Bit of a slow start but by hour 4-5, once you're out in the open world and have finished off the tutorial missions, it becomes a great laugh with some pretty intense moments.

Bit of a learning curve at the start, but once you are accustomed to it you may want to play on Hard if looking for a challenge as Normal gets rather easy once you've upgraded the character a bit and have a good handle on scavenging, crafting, and knowing what weapons to use at what times.

A solid 8/10 for me.

EDIT after 72 hours:

WOW! Over the past few weeks I have become addicted to this game's gameplay loop. And it can be a LONG game if you do all the missions available (main story missions + camp missions + nests + ambush camps + bounty hunter + NERO checkpoints/research sites + hordes). I am not done the story yet, but am definitely very close to it now. The more you play this game, the better it gets. I mean, once I complete the story, I do not see myself going for New Game+ or anything, I have a lot of other games to play, but what I mean is the first few hours the game is very iffy, then hour 5 - 15 its like ""OK, this actually is pretty great and oooh I want this upgrade and that gun and more stamina to fight hordes etc."" hour 15 - 30 you get to the 2nd map and realise how much more there is to the game. hour 30 - 45 you get a 3rd map, which I did NOT realise existed (I had heard people speak of a ""2nd map"" which presumably actually is this one, the 3rd map, it took me over 40 hours to get to it and I thought when the first map opened up more that was the 2nd map haha! Wow. By hour 45 I realised what a package this game really is, and how long it is playing the way I am playing. Now, I have finished the main story and almost all of the side content except some hordes and the NG+, which I don't think I will bother to do, it was a great game but I am done with it for now at least, maybe pop in to it once in a while to take down a few hordes though! The story ended quite well I thought, it kinda got better and better as it went on. It started out ROUGH, but by the end I was enjoying it a lot. 

Now I change my score:

Managing fuel and hunting for more especially on harder difficulties is some fun stealth survival. I wish the bike physics were more ""dangerous"", but its smooth and very satisfying.

Had some great NATURALLY tense moments. You can get remarkably close to 100 sleeping freaks before you realize it.
Your interactions with the world like clearing out hives and killing all the 'freaks' in a small town have lasting effects on the world, they don't just keep respawning every time you ride through.  In fact, you may find you've allowed some other stuff to start happening in the area [b]because[/b] you cleared it out.  It made the world feel real and that you were accomplishing stuff.

The game's set in the pacific northwest in an open world setting where you travel on your motorcycle between camps. The world design, paired with the fluid motorcycle controls, leads to unforgettably scenic moments. The most impressive feat of Days Gone is how you truthfully only do one type of errand/fetch quest on repeat for the entire game but it's still fun and interesting. Hordes are the highlight of the game and you encounter them in various environments, from pitch black caves & mines to a farm & city. Your motorcycle can be upgraded and utilized similar to the car from Mad Max (PC 2015), and the game includes a ""Challenge Mode"" missions which if you complete to Bronze/Silver/Gold score level which each add a patch to your vest in-game for increased stats or bonuses. The story is a slow burn at first, but once it picks up pace it's some of the best writing and character design of this genre.

Days Gone is an open-world zombie shooter who lets you play Deacon, a biker looking to survive, and hopefully find his long-lost wife. Dive into the landscapes of the pacific Northwest with your motorcycle, help your fellow survivors, and live to see another day. Here's a detailed list of the pros and cons of this game, which I've fully completed, and whether I recommend it or not.

[b] Pros [/b]
[list]
[*] The graphics are beautiful and super immersive, and there's a particular attention to details. It's without a doubt one of the best looking games I've ever played.
[*] The gameplay is also great. The guns feel snappy, your arsenal is varied and interesting, there's different types of enemies, riding your bike feels smooth, and the hordes, although difficult, are balanced.
[*] The soundtrack is amazing. It suits extremely well the game and the overall situation you're put in.
[*] The performances were great 99% of the time, hitting high FPS (around 90-100) with graphics maxed out. I was definitely impressed, even though I have a high end rig, since the same level of graphics can be found in Cyberpunk and I barely hit 60 fps while playing it. [/list]

[b] Neutrals [/b]
[list]
[*] The story is decent, but it plays a little too safe in my opinion. It's not a bad story at all, and it gets pretty emotional here and there, but since the game revolves around key narrative points that are mostly predictable, it can get a little boring at some point. The ending felt straight out of a Walt Disney movie too. The characters are however really well developed and easy to get attached to.
[*] The level design is also decent. Even though the world is beautiful and diverse, there's no core locations that really stands out, aside from the camps. Unless you're killing the hordes or grabbing the collectibles all around, there's no point in exploring that much.
[*] While the zombies are programmed perfectly in my opinion, the human AIs can sometimes leave a little to be desired in some cases. It wasn't a burden enough to put it in the [i] Cons [/i] though. [/list]

[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
[*] The game has quite some bugs. I was wondering whether I would mention this in the [i] Neutrals [/i] instead, since they are mostly minor bugs, but given the fact I've had to restart my game and reboot a save three times in total due to quests being bugged out, or being attacked by invisible enemies, it was annoying. I've encountered a numerous amount of bugs, and although the majority of them aren't terrible, they can break your immersion easily.
[*] The game drags on and on, until it feels too long. The story takes around 40 hours to complete if you're focusing the main quest, and the pace was a bit too slow for me. But this isn't the main issue: the side quests are. They're tedious, extremely repetitive, and they try to fill a void created by the somewhat empty world, but miserably fail to do so. I've played a lot of Ubisoft games, known for their terrible side quests, and I can say confidently that Days Gone also stands on that level.
[*] Following my last point, fully completing this game is also incredibly boring. It's mostly a ''grab collectibles, complete bland side quests'' formula, taken to the extreme, since it can take up to 70 hours to reach full completion for your first playthrough (you also need to do a NG+ in the hardest difficulty to unlock all achievements). I wasn't a fan of it. [/list]

[b] TL;DR [/b]
A beautiful zombies open-world with satisfying and impressive third-person gameplay. It has its issues, and it drags on for too long in my opinion, but it is still a rewarding and fun experience overall. If you like zombie shooters similar to World War Z or Left 4 Dead 2, you'll most likely enjoy this game too, but I cannot guarantee it will be for everyone.

Usually they are quite short so it doesn't overstay or get too annoying. I really like the shift in how powerful the player is as you progress - starting with crappy weapons that can barely take down a pack of 4 freaks, all the way up to belt fed lmgs, that you will be clearing hordes of 300+ freaks with.

 The graphics in Days Gone are breathtaking, showcasing lush forests and desolate urban areas with remarkable detail. The open-world setting allows for freedom and exploration, making every excursion feel like a genuine struggle for survival. The dynamic weather system adds realism, intensifying the sense of danger lurking around every corner.

 Playing as Deacon St. John, a tough bounty hunter, we dive into his personal journey through this cruel world after the pandemic. The narrative skillfully weaves together the themes of survival, loss and redemption, forcing players to be involved from beginning to end. Well-developed characters and emotional narration made an indelible impression.

 Combat in Days Gone is intense and satisfying, especially when facing hordes of zombie-like creatures known as Freakers. The game offers a variety of strategies and weapons, allowing for adaptability in different situations. It's a thrilling experience that keeps you on your toes.

 One of the aspects that really distinguishes Days Gone from other games in this genre is the connection that has arisen with Deacon's motorcycle. It goes beyond simple transportation, becoming a reliable companion in the midst of chaos. Customization options and attention to detail make the motorcycle look like a lifeline, symbolizing survival and freedom in a harsh world. These unique relationships give the game depth and emotional attachment.

 While the cancellation of Days Gone 2 is disappointing news, it doesn't take away from the incredible experience the first game offers. Days Gone will forever hold a special place in my gaming memories. If you haven't played it yet, I highly recommend immersing yourself in this thrilling post-apocalyptic ride.

P.S. Have a nice game to everyone :)",1689006899,1689007035,True,9,0,0.604768693447113037,0,True,False,False

As a former console gamer who has transitioned to PC gaming, I am grateful for the opportunity to enjoy the Port. However, I would love to see more titles  ported to PC

From the moment you step into the shoes of Deacon St. John, the game's protagonist, you are engrossed in his quest for survival in a challenging post-apocalyptic world. I won't spoil any surprises, but the main story is incredibly fascinating and kept me engaged from beginning to end.

The gameplay in Days Gone is undeniably badass. The highlight is undoubtedly the exhilarating hordes of zombies that you must face. However, it's not a task you can simply jump into. You must progress through the main story, improve your skills, and prepare strategically to take on these terrifying masses of undead. The experience of facing a horde is heart-pounding and demands both courage and intelligence. Few other zombie games come close to delivering the sheer terror and intensity that Days Gone offers.

What sets Days Gone apart is the perfect blend of stealth and action. You have the freedom to choose your approach to combat, and the game rarely forces you into a specific playstyle. The developers have skillfully crafted a balance that avoids the frustration often associated with forced stealth sequences.

The music in Days Gone is exceptional, enhancing the emotional impact of the game. It wisely uses songs with lyrics sparingly, reminiscent of the approach in Red Dead Redemption 1. The inclusion of Lewis Capaldi in the end credits is a delightful surprise, as his talent as a singer adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the game.

Days Gone is an incredible game that has found a special place in my heart. While it may not be suitable for those who dislike open-world repetitiveness, the core story and the thrill of zombie killing make it an outstanding experience. The character of Deacon St. John is morally ambiguous and realistically portrayed, fitting seamlessly into the post-apocalyptic setting.

The game's landscape is beautiful, weapon variety is terrific, and the enemies are diverse and challenging. The hordes in particular are terrifyingly realistic, reminiscent of the zombies in World War Z, with their ability to climb over one another and fill doorways and hallways. The bike riding mechanics are satisfying and fun, although occasionally a bit slippery. While some minor bugs and occasional crashes were present, they did not detract significantly from the overall enjoyment.

Days Gone's PC port is well-executed, running smoothly for the vast majority of the game. Occasional frame drops and stutters may occur, but they are infrequent and do not significantly impact the experience. The game's quality and immersive gameplay make it well worth the purchase, even at full price.

In conclusion, Days Gone is an underrated gem that takes a few hours to find its stride but quickly becomes an extraordinary experience. The progression of the player, the bike, and the weapons is noticeable and rewarding. The setting is stunning, voice acting is excellent, and immersion is top-notch. Although the game has some flaws, such as certain unappealing characters and a slow start, its positives far outweigh the negatives. Days Gone tells a tale of loyalty, brotherhood, and staying true to one's values, making it a truly remarkable game that holds a special place in the hearts of many players.

Pros:

    Noticeable player progression, empowering the character and the bike.
    Beautiful setting, immersive world, and impressive voice acting.
    Exciting gameplay combining stealth and action.
    Engaging story with twists and turns, centered around a morally ambiguous protagonist.
    Satisfying bike mechanics and a wide variety of weapons.
    Terrifying and realistic zombie hordes that provide a unique challenge.

Neutral:

    Gas management can be tedious at times, but it adds to the realism.
    Resource distribution feels unbalanced, with some being overly abundant while others are extremely rare.
    Crafting system and commerce are a bit inconsistent and underdeveloped.

Cons:

    Some characters may not be well-liked by players.
    The game has a slow start and could benefit from trimming its length.
    Early game weapons lack excitement and may feel underwhelming.
    The drip feed of content can feel too slow at times.

Despite these minor gripes, Days Gone is an extraordinary game that delivers an unforgettable experience. Its flaws, although present, do not overshadow the game's overall quality and the enjoyment it provides. I highly recommend this game to anyone seeking a thrilling third-person action story set in a post-apocalyptic world filled with intense zombie encounters.",1688968651,1688968651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now, the NG+ has actually exposed to me many aspects of the game which I find annoying and poor. I would like to list them out very briefly in hope that a sequel will be a huge improvement and will take it on another level. And I do want to see and play a sequel, I believe Days Gone deserves not only a sequel but several spin-off titles based on the same zombie franchise. 

So, my main complaints about Days Gone are the following:
- the number of interactive keep-going-forward type of cutscenes: I'm a true hater of such moments in any games and I strongly believe that a game is a game when you actually play it, not when you are forced to follow another character or drive them on your vehicle, being forced to listen to some dialogue (even though the game allows you to skip all cutscenes and some in-game moments as well like the Copeland's radio speech). Those moments when you simply have to go from point A to B and then from B to C (and cannot leave the area because otherwise your checkpoint reloads) might have been not such an issue during my first playthrough, but they are a real pain in NG+ and I hate them. The same goes to the retrospective stories with Sarah - the game is forcing you to follow your GF, pick up 3 flowers for her in like 6 ft area or in another ""mission"" you only drive her around, that's rediculous. And there's no way to skip that, no matter how much you want to. This stuff is for movies, not for games, and I just don't want to play an interactive movie with no decision/action elements, just holding the joystick forward, this should be rather a cutscene to watch. 
- infinite amount of fuel during the interactive cutscenes: whenever one of those moments during which all you have to do is to drive to point A happens, your bike for some reason stops consuming fuel and the fuel consumption icon disappears. This breaks immersion in my opinion and confirms the fact that all you're supposed to do is to participate in an interactive cutscene, just following another character with no option to do anything else like refueling.
- lack of interactions with deeper waters like lakes: this is actually something I'd love to see in a sequel, and doesn't mean I need my character to swim. I just would like to see some vehicles like boats, kayaks or pontoons with a good reason to use them (e.g. to avoid some dangers on the road or to get somewhere faster). 
- lack of character customisation. 
- glitches (which game doesn't have them, right?): occasionally I'd encounter a raider who just got  idle on his motorcycle, sitting and not driving. They wouldn't react to me shooting at them, nothing. That happened only during my NG+ playthrough.  

Overall I truly recommend this game to everyone and I did enjoy every hour spent playing it. I'm especially a big fan of any dev who can create an excellent product without X number of DLCs or payable add-ons.",1688839750,1688855133,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Days Gone is an absolute masterpiece of a game that left me enthralled from start to finish. Bend Studio has crafted an unforgettable experience set in a post-apocalyptic open world that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire journey.

The storyline of Days Gone is a rollercoaster of emotions. As Deacon St. John, a former outlaw biker turned survivor, you're thrust into a world overrun by Freakers (zombies) and various factions fighting for control. The narrative is expertly written, filled with compelling characters, and features numerous twists and turns that kept me engaged from the very beginning. I felt a genuine connection to Deacon's struggles, his search for his missing wife, and the choices he had to make in this unforgiving world.

The game's open-world environment is breathtakingly beautiful and diverse. From the lush forests to the desolate highways and abandoned towns, every corner of the map is meticulously designed and teeming with detail. The dynamic weather and day-night cycle further enhance the immersion, creating a sense of realism that is second to none. Exploring the vast landscape on Deacon's trusty motorcycle is an absolute joy, and the sense of freedom it provides is unparalleled.

Combat in Days Gone is intense, visceral, and incredibly satisfying. Whether I was facing hordes of Freakers or engaging in firefights with rival factions, the gameplay mechanics offered a wide range of options. The crafting system allowed me to create and modify weapons to suit my playstyle, while stealth and strategic planning played a crucial role in survival. The AI of both enemies and allies was impressively realistic, adding an extra layer of challenge and immersion to the combat encounters.

One of the standout features of Days Gone is the breathtaking attention to detail. The game's developers have clearly poured their hearts and souls into creating a world that feels alive. From the stunning graphics to the atmospheric sound design, every aspect of the game comes together seamlessly to create an immersive experience like no other. The level of polish and care that went into crafting this world is evident in every frame.

Moreover, the game's post-launch support has been outstanding. The developers have continued to release updates and improvements, addressing player feedback and adding new content to keep the experience fresh and engaging. It's commendable to see a studio so dedicated to their creation and the community that supports it.

In conclusion, Days Gone is a must-play game for any fan of open-world adventures and post-apocalyptic settings. Its compelling story, breathtaking visuals, immersive gameplay, and attention to detail combine to deliver an unforgettable experience. Bend Studio has created a game that sets a new standard for the genre, and I can't recommend it enough.",1688773304,1688773304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I want to say in advance that the motivations of the characters are doubtful, the plot is artificially drawn out and filled with garbage tasks, backtracking, etc. I tried to overcome myself already at 8-10 hours of the story, when the game takes 30-40 hours.
Purely for comparison, I’ll say that the game could use a degree of seriousness, weightiness and some heaviness, something like The Last of Us or Red Dead Redamption 2.

-It can support 500 zombies on screen.
-You ride around in a bike that has limited amount of fuel and you can do missions for different camps kinda like Mad Max 2015 game.
-Alongside zombies, You also have human enemies and you can even make zombies and humans fight eachother.
-It has Sam Witwer(Starkiller) as the main protagonist.
-Good variety of missions and enemies.
-Open world feels alive thanks to the random events that can happen.
-Story is awesome.
-The game also has stealth sections which are mostly optional outside of some few missions.
-If you like photography in video games, this game has a great photo mode that you can enjoy.
-And if you want to jump straight into action you can just play the challenge missions from the main menu.

Even on keyboard and mouse, they totally nailed it. Road killing a deer and watch it go sky high for no reason, heck yeah!
-Cons:
1) Gun play. Mutants will dodge your bullets as if they are Neo from Matrix while walking in a straight line and they are blinded by your flashlight. They leaned a little too hard on the ability ""Focus"" instead of letting people feel like their aiming skills actually matters. Human enemies however, xD They hear you shoot a shotgun and proceed to charge you with a wooden plank (atleast they aint Neo ), alright bro!

2) When you use a sniper, You might feel that you just suck at zeroing in on a targets head, but its actually just that the game stops tracking your mouse movement if you move it slow. Thats another ""F- you"" for absolutely no reason.

3) Dont you just love it when Copeland starts to preach about freedom, while you are trying to listen to a NERO recording, while you are listening to Boozer telling you what to do in your next mission, heck yeah. It can get pretty ridiculous because there is just no queue for radio chatter. And more often than not, if you disrupt the ENTIRE chatter going through in one go, you get to listen to it all over again and you cannot mute it, great.

4) Carlos fight. ""Have you been in the poo lately?"" Yeah... Stab a crackhead a 100 times in the head -> No signs of blood and has no scars of it 5 seconds later in the cutscene, AAALRIGHTY THEN.

5) The general attention to minor details, see number 4 for an example.

Totally exceeded all expectations. They weren't low - I had heard how much praise the game was getting since it was free in PS+ and also how amazing it was since the PC version released. Just never really seemed like a game to hold my attention... I was wrong. 

Graphics are so good. So much care and love were out into every little detail visually.
The gameplay is fun, never feels tedious at all, even driving from point a to b is very fun, listening to all the dialogue and story bits as you go, which brings me to another thing...
The voice acting is so exceptional, so beyond what you would expect from a video game. The characters talk like people. They feel like people.

The world you inhabit is by turn beautiful and heartbreaking, the characters feel vibrant and genuine, never cliched, trite, or  in service of a narrative punching bag. The voice acting is some of the best I've come across in gaming.

This game did not sell particularly well on playstation, which I think is a screaming outrage. It deserved so much more praise and recognition, and I'm hoping that it's second life (geddit) on PC will help with that.

Days Gone is a breath of fresh air in a world of greed and cutting corners to release unfinished games. Days Gone visuals are from a different world and always amaze me. The story is very engaging and leaves me wanting to play more missions out of anticipation. I don’t always finish single-player games because of the developer's lack of work ethics and personal life responsibilities. However, I am honored to give 50 hours and will recommend it to my friends. A must-have for enthusiastic gamers that love adventurous single-player games and want total immersion.

My usual setting for games is hard, and I also tried it for this one, but even on easy you can't defeat a Horde of zombies on several attempts! (On hard difficulty, you cannot change the difficulty mid-game, so I had to start the game again for lower difficulty)

In the beginning, I enjoyed the game and wondered why Sony hadn't approved a sequel, but the more I played, the more I understood!

Most of the time you have to travel with your bike to point A to get a boring mission (capture someone by following them on your bike, raid a camp, etc.) and repeat it. Your character has a walkie-talkie, they call you to visit them because they have a mission!! WTF! So give the mission on the radio!!!
If you've already cleared a path of nests, you can fast-travel (at the cost of using gas), but what's the point of the game if I use that all the time to reach point A??!

The NPC characters are a bunch of as$holes, and I was like, why the hell should I even help them? They talk to you like you are their slave!!

Stamina regeneration is a disaster and takes a long time to fill! I bet even someone like me who hasn't run since high school can run faster without getting tired, especially with zombies chasing me!

The graphics and performance of the game are actually very good, and I liked the environment a lot, but the problems I mentioned earlier killed all the fun, which made me uninstall the game.
(I bought it on sale, but I still feel robbed).

From the moment I dove into the desolate world of Oregon, I was instantly hooked on the gripping narrative, intense gameplay, and stunning visuals that unfolded before me.

The first thing that struck me about ""Days Gone"" was its beautifully crafted open-world environment. The landscapes are breathtaking, ranging from dense forests and abandoned towns to treacherous mountains and desolate roads. The attention to detail is remarkable in every aspect, making this post-apocalyptic world feel truly alive.

The storyline of ""Days Gone"" is another standout feature. Players assume the role of Deacon St. John, a grizzled biker and former outlaw tasked with surviving the zombie-like ""Freaker"" horde that has overrun the land. As Deacon, players are taken on an emotional rollercoaster, navigating through a dark and unpredictable narrative, filled with unexpected twists and turns. The depth and complexity of the characters I encountered along the way made me invested in their journeys and added an extra layer of immersion to the game.

Combat in ""Days Gone"" is both thrilling and challenging. The hordes of Freakers I encountered throughout my journey were relentless and required careful planning and strategy to overcome. The game offers a vast arsenal of weapons, traps, and explosives, which made every encounter an adrenaline-pumping test of skill and creativity. The dynamic weather and day-night cycle further added to the intensity, creating a harrowing atmosphere that kept me on the edge of my seat.

What sets ""Days Gone"" apart from other post-apocalyptic games is its emphasis on survival and exploration. The game encourages players to scavenge for resources, upgrade their motorcycle, and follow various storylines and side quests. This freedom to roam and explore the world at my own pace allowed me to fully immerse myself in the game, uncovering hidden areas, encountering unique characters, and truly shaping my own experience.

Furthermore, the voice acting and sound design in ""Days Gone"" are exemplary. The performances were so convincing that I found myself emotionally invested in the characters, feeling their pain, joy, and desperation through their voices.

In conclusion, ""Days Gone"" is a truly captivating post-apocalyptic adventure that delivers on all fronts. From its stunning visuals and immersive open-world, to its compelling storyline and intense gameplay, the game offers a thrilling experience from start to finish. If you're a fan of action-packed, narrative-driven games with a touch of survival and exploration, ""Days Gone"" should definitely be on your must-play list.",1679281131,1688301056,True,3,2,0.547169804573059082,0,True,False,False

The story centers around the actions of Deacon St. John as he confronts the horrors of a post-apocalyptic, freaker infested world while searching for the whereabouts of his wife Sarah. Deacon's determination, lethal skills & somewhat cynical nature makes him both an endearing & memorable protagonist.

Pros:
+Great Story: The story does an excellent job portraying both the mental & physical struggles of Deacon as he fights for survival in a post-apocalyptic Oregon while searching for his wife Sarah. The details of the deadly post-apocalyptic virus outbreak, various factions & their relation to Deacon & Sarah are revealed as progress is made through the main story-line & its side quests.
+Excellent Graphics: Post-apocalyptic Oregon looks simply beautiful from its snow-capped mountain peaks to crystal clear lakes. This makes for some breathtaking scenery when not taking on menacing freaker hordes or patrolling the grim remainder of human settlements scattered throughout the map. 
+Great Combat: The combat makes great use of Deacon's melee weapons, guns, throwables & traps when clearing out enemy encampments or taking on freaker hordes. This helps to complement your play-style whether its stealth or going in guns blazing. The skill tree is well implemented which enhances melee & ranged combat along with survival.
+Good Controls: The game's controls are simple and responsive when in combat or burning rubber through the back roads of Oregon on your motorcycle.
+Great Soundtrack: The somber yet at times menacing soundtrack definitely complements the look & feel of the game.

Cons:
-Some quests tend to follow a generic rinse & repeat formula, especially when clearing out hordes or ambush camps.
-Lack of cosmetics. While you can customize Deacon's drifter bike to some extent. There is no way of making the character uniquely yours by way of altering Deacon's appearance, at least without the use of mods.",1688146547,1688146547,True,79,1,0.846768856048583984,17,True,False,False

The sad part is that they dropped this in favor of scam games designed to make you grind endlessly to get a special gun. If Developers would look at truly masterful games like this and try to build on them, expand them, or even build another game that is a shadow of this one and add new features, like private servers, the ability to mod the game, they would create massive followings surrounding something like this and it could change the face of gaming for the better. Instead they drop something like this because it doesn't fit political narrative. When did online gamers ever ascribe to politically correct thinking? The answer is NEVER, they are trolls at heart, and want good games, they want to be able to edit them, they want to get online and laugh with their friends, they want a good story, they want blood, guts, breast, drama, and to be on the edge of their seat! They want to want to see what happens to the character, and they want to be able to get all the guns, inventory, money and power they can. That is what gamers want!

For my money, Days Gone remains one of the absolute best open-world games on the market.
Even though the gameplay stays pretty much the same throughout the entire game, a powerful story, the acting, riding your motorcycle and the survival bits make this game worth while.

It's a damn good game, and I can say that and mean it. What blows my mind is that there are people who give this a bad rating, from what I can tell people are gonna bitch no matter what. Honestly, I feel it's been years since I've come across a game that's just refreshing to play and it actually ""sorta"" reinvents what we know as the zombie genre. The reason I say sorta is because it's kinda a cross between World War Z, RDR and Far Cry but with IMO a much better story and voice acting. Let's get down to brass tacks shall we? 

Pros
* I want to lead off with this: riding a motorcycle in this game is a real pleasure, sooooo many games have screwed this up but Days Gone, wow. I've hardly used the fast travel thus far and I've already logged 30+ hours. It feels good, your bike reacts when you go off road, hit a rock or run into some wildlife. It's as good as riding a horse in RDR2, but less buggy. 

* Not a massive map like RDR2, I'd say it's closer in size to maybe Far Cry 3, but none the less there are plenty of things to see, little events to do and collectibles to find. 

* Game looks gorgeous, I don't know how it looked on PS, but it looks wonderful on PC

* Voice acting is pretty darn good too, great dialogue with an entertaining story (you are also able to skip any minor dialogue, just in case you get a annoyed by certain characters)

* While there isn't a huge selection of guns and loot, the game does a nice job letting you find or buy better guns as you progress through the game

* There are 3 different leveling trees for Deacon (main character), I haven't leveled them out but each one seems to vastly improve your abilities whether that's hunting, collecting food, or maybe just helping with your stam and shooting (I'm not sure, but I don't think you can max out Deacon's stats from just one play through, I could be wrong)

* Getting to fight hordes of enemies in Days Gone is a challenge but very fun, this is something fairly unique to this game. I'm sure you've seen it in the trailers. But I don't recall or haven't played a game where you deal with a horde of enemies before, not like this at least. It 100% adds authenticity to what Bend Studios was trying to do with Days Gone. Which is, might I add, to feel completely and utterly overwhelmed. 

Cons

*One aspect of the game is you constantly need gas for your motorcycle, makes sense right? Well, you can't take an extra gas can with you so you have to look around for it. As you progress in the game it becomes quite a chore to get gas if you don't have money or you aren't around any places that have gas cans. It especially becomes annoying when you have to travel from one side of the map to the other, you cant cross the map with the first 2 gas tanks you can unlock for your bike. So be prepared to look for gas on your longer trips. This is okay for the first few times it happens, but as your missions seems to send you further and further away, this becomes obnoxious quick.  

* I wish there were more wildlife. I've seen bears, wolves and deer. I also wish they had expanded on the hunting and gathering portion of this game.

* Stealth could be improved as well, sometimes when you are hiding in a bush or tall grass you are easily seen by enemies and other times you can quite literally disappear in front of them. It doesn't make sense.
 
* I wish there were more side quests, like I mentioned there are little events you can do that pop up on your mini map as blue question marks, but most of the time they don't really yield you anything useful. Sometimes you'll find someone needing rescued, but that's not that often and the reward is minimal. 

* Funny enough, I did mention wishing there were more side quests but on the flip side what is a bit annoying is you can't just do the main story line quests without having to do a bunch of annoying side quests. I only mention this because the story is damn good, but people may not want to do all the extra stuff and in Days Gone you are stuck doing side events to advance the plot.

* Kinda drives me nuts you aren't able to change your clothes in this game. Cosmetics aren't always important, but it's just missing from this game completely, excluding your bike cosmetics. I know it's a minor thing, but the game does take course over weeks or months. There is a night and day feature and a counter that lets you know how many days have gone by. Idk seems weird to me to not have that feature. 

* I also wish there were more bounties to collect, not just from freaks but for enemies as well. It seems like after you've done certain missions for camp rep, there won't be anymore to do. Which is kinda sad, I have fun hunting down so and so, because he is a piece of crap rapist etc. 

Truth be told, the cons are pretty minor. If they do a second Days Gone they can expand of some these topics I mentioned. But other then that, you are really going to enjoy Days Gone especially if you enjoyed the other games I referred to during the review. This means 2 thumbs up and if I could raise my big toes like thumbs, I'd do that too!

That might not be an exact quote. But it’s close enough. I love it. Finally, a protagonist we can relate to.

Deacon’s sort of a murder hobo, going around the world on his motorcycle and doing missions for various groups of survivors while never settling down. Then his bro gets hurt and he finds evidence that his wife survived the apocalypse, and he must get all invested in society again. Lame. Always sucks when you have a good thing going and the plot ruins everything.

So now Deacon’s going around beautiful open world rural Oregon killing zombies (including child zombies which may be the first time I’ve seen that in a game), upgrading his bike, and scavenging for collectibles in between homicidal rampages. You know, the usual open world stuff. 

There are basically two things that stand out about Days Gone. The first is the zombies. You can run into ginormous hordes of them. Hundreds of them are trying to chase you down. Tense stuff. Then there’s the motorcycle. At first its pretty annoying. You’ll have to scrounge for gas a lot in the beginning (and you do not want to have to do a lot of tedious walking in this game). Eventually, you can upgrade it and the bike becomes less “busywork” and more “pleasant sightseeing tour.”

I liked it a lot and recommend it highly.

I love this game. This has to be my favorite game. I understand theres alot of people who didnt have a good experience with the game. And I can see why. But its hit a checkbox for almost every feature I could want in a game.

1. Zombies (My favorite genre of horror) With a newer/interesting take, I love the idea of being able to find unscripted hordes. Like, hordes you just find, not that are secluded to being in certain missions. I love running into hordes that are 50 zombies big, its terrifying and gets my blood pumping.

2. A neat uncommon feature that is actually important to gameplay without being overbearing, in this form the motorcycle. Its the perfect balance being able to play with and without it. 

3. The story, 8.5/10 feels more personal and emotional than most zombie games. Almost all the characters are very well written, dialogue feels fluid and not choppy (most of the time)

4. The Open World. Its huge, its vast, and its engaging. Theres so much to do and its been alot of fun exploring. Its made better by the encounters with enemies you can have (hordes, marauders, etc) I havent had a single moment of boredom so far.

5. survival mechanics/gameplay. the crafting, looting, and combat are all great. Its intriquite while not being overwhelming, theres a ton of weapons and its fun to use them. Melee combat has been my favorite so far. Finding new melee weapons and switching out your old ones in a pinch is smooth and the combat is even smoother. Enemies dont feel clunky and everything feels very fluid.

I know thats not alot to check off, but I havent found a game thats balanced all these aspects as well as Days Gone has. Im loving the game and I cant wait to play more.

When It finally got ported to PC I was excited. The game is a joy to play. The world, once you progress through the story is big enough without feeling *TOO* big. The story is average but serviceable. The main character is definitely a main character if that makes any sense. He talks to himself, will go from whispering to shouting and is exactly what you'd expect from someone who was part of a Biker MC prior to the apocalypse.  

Riding the motorcycle is fun and clearing nests makes for a difficult and enjoyable battle.

Days Gone brings fluid motorcycle movement, bounty hunting, and zombie killing sprees together seamlessly within an engaging and rich story driven environment. The challenge modes and new game + are all exciting and worth the investment. Both game modes bring motorcycles skins and campaign buffs to enhance your overall abilities in your onslaught of the undead. The only real issue I had with the game was the amount of time Deacon spends talking to himself can become pretty overwhelming at times. In saying that, I understand how a story must be told in a visual element and the player can't read minds. However, despite what Deacon boasts as a bounty hunter, he is less than average at trash talking, but that doesn't stop him from trying.  The game is definitely worth the full price but I'd recommend buying the game on a sale due to the lack of a future.

The story was done so well with this game that you will always remember it, although it is a romance story really so some may not find that appealing. All of the voice acting was done well too, you can hear the emotions in the character's voices. They did a great job with the open world and really made it seem and feel like an actual zombie Apocalypse, the only down side is that night time is not really dark at all and i think that was a missed opportunity, if they would have made nighttime actually realistically dark to were you are forced to use your flashlight/bike light at night it would have brought so much more of a fear/difficulty level to the game. The zombies them selves for the most part look pretty good and there are different types as well. There is a pretty good amount of content with this game along with it's pretty long main story line. You should get at least 50+ hours out of this game if you take your time with it and don't just rush through the story. There is a player skill tree that will allow you to unlock different abilities along with a health/focus upgrades that you can find and use. There is a decent amount of guns to find/buy that can be semi modded by putting a silencer on some of them or even a extended meg. You can also get 2 different types of crossbows and of course there are also melee weapons that can be found/modded into something better. You can buy upgrades for the bike you have to make it better and better in different ways, You can also customize the appearance of the bike as well. This game does offer fast travel points once you start clearing out nest's to unlock said fast travel location, but honestly i never really use them i enjoy exploring by just riding around.  The map for this game is actually much larger than i thought it was going to be so that's always a plus. Graphically the game is pretty good looking and still runs smooth for the most part with minor frame loss when riding around on the bike. The only negative things about this game that i can think of are honestly just nit picky stuff, for example even though the dialog for all the characters in this game are well written they do tend to radio into to you a lot and it can become a little annoying at times, also your charter that you play as does a lot of commentary on things that you do when just out and about and it can also become a little annoying. There are some minor visual glitches that can occur along with some small bugs that i did notice on my 2nd play through of the game but it was never anything game breaking. As i stated before there is a good amount of content in this game but some of the side content  that can be done like burning out nest's or clearing out zombie hordes can start to get a bit boring after doing so many of them since it is doing the same thing over and over just in a new location. The aiming/shooting guns in this game could have been a bit better in the sense of accuracy, what i mean by this is sometimes you will be aiming right at a persons chest area or even the head but for whatever reason it completely misses the shot almost like the game did not register the hit marker. Other than those things there really is not much else that i would consider to be a con in this game. Overall this is a wonderful game and in my opinion i do think it is worth the asking price. Sadly though once you finish the game that's it, i don't think the people who made this game are ever going to be making a squeal :(",1621352119,1687897025,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've got a feeling I'm about halfway done with the game and while the game play is amazing, the story kind of drags it down. The writing in this game feels like it was done by several different people and none of them checked where the others were at before writing their lines. Characters will go from angry to sad to in the middle in the span of 3 lines of dialogue. There's a character who looks to be a teen, but talks like she's 6. Every time I managed to break away from the story and go do some exploring on my own I get sucked right back in. You'll quickly learn that the dialogue is bad because no one in this game ever stops talking. Deacon could be in the process of sneaking up behind a zombie to take it out quietly and will decide to loudly talk about how it's always raining, or trying to infiltrate a ripper camp and start yelling out about how he's going to get every last one of them. It's a big disconnect between what the player is trying to do and what Deacon is saying/doing. The story is uninteresting, but I keep finding myself coming back and slogging through it just to get to more of the gameplay.

The bike is a wonder to ride, the guns are equally fun to shoot, and the zombies are well zombies. The human enemies aren't great as enemies but they get the job done. The only actual criticism I have of gameplay is that gun ammunition aren't interchangeable, meaning if you have an assault rifle, but it's different than the assault rifle the enemy has then you cannot pick up the bullets that an enemy drops when you kill them. I get that in real life they have different ammunition sizes, but the game doesn't specify this. When you pick up ammo in the world, it's just classified as ""assault rifle/pistol/shotgun ammo"" but the shotgun shells that fit in my sidearm won't fit in my primary and the AK rounds won't fit in the MRS. Slightly annoying but on the normal difficulty the game gives you enough materials that you'll rarely be fighting tooth and nail for some.

combats with scarce ammunitions, Exploration where you need to clear infestations but this time with the help of molotov's. A lot of bike riding in a pleasant world (z apart). And a bit of loot for crafting.
I haven't seen any base management yet, that's where the comparison ends.
A bit of crafting for bandages, throwables and improved weapons.

It is SO easy to drop it.. It has repetitive missions that dilate the story with no reason, and that's the low point of Day's Gone.

I came in expecting nothing and knowing very little about the game. It was clear from the get go that the devs really gave a crap about this title. It runs well, albeit with stuttering every now and then from what I assume is parts of the open world loading in.
I've only had like 3 bugs during my entire playthrough, considering how large this game feels, and how many storylines and carefully crafted camps and abandoned builders there are to explore I think this is more than acceptable
In the 60 hours that I have played
- Once or twice textures stop streaming high resolution textures for no apparent reason, then you have these PS1 looking parts of the map
- On one occasion meshes were invisible in ONE of the probably thousands of houses on the map
- The final mission of the <spoiler> camp, right before the <spoiler> chambers, part of the tunnel didn't load in, allowing the player to fall through the map

All of these bugs resolved themselves with a simple restart and are totally forgivable in my opinion for over 60 hours of truly immersive gameplay

The combat mechanics are great and there are often multiple ways to approach a mission
The storylines, although a little bit cringe at times, offer a great source of immersion and will be well worth your time to complete
After the credits roll, I recommend hanging around a little longer to finish the Obrien storyline, I think it showed up after about 30 mins or so for me :) 

Truly an epic game, pity there's no word of a sequel

This is really a beautiful game (much of it looks far better then Red Dead Redemption 2) with great characters that not only feel real (well, most of them) but also have their own character / unique way of moving and expressing themselves. I've never seen anything like it and it truly is wonderful. 

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
But more importantly, the game itself is a lot of fun. Is is perfect? No, some pieces are slow and -for instance- continuously fueling up the (apparantly grapefruitsized) tank of your bike is a grind that I could do without. Not sure why that is even a thing in the game. 
Another gripe is characters refusing to give you a mission even when you know they got one... to only 'message' you that they have a mission AFTER you drive away from their camp. And then they don't even give you the mission... oh no... they tell you to come to them in person. BUT I WAS THERE 5 MINUTES AGO AND CHECKED YOU FOR A MISSION. Now you make me come back and I happen to need to perform your mission at the place that I JUST WAS WHEN YOU MESSAGED ME?
But again, apart from above frustrations the game is still a lot of fun to do. I guess I just have an itch for killing zombies that I can't fulfill in real life ;-). Fights are fun, hordes are fun, skilltree is... OK. 

[b]Bugs:[/b]
Is it bugfree? In my personal playthrough I didn't experience any ""real bugs"", the only weird thing is that sometimes when your... eh... victims die their body ragdolls 3m in the air for some reason. Definitely not game breaking... maybe immersion breaking for some but to me (=stickler for immersion usually) it was more comical than anything else.

This open-world action-adventure game had me hooked from the very beginning, immersing me in a world overrun by hordes of infected creatures known as ""Freakers."" Join me as I share my detailed review of this captivating game, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.

Pros:

1. Engrossing Storyline: From the moment I assumed the role of Deacon St. John, I was instantly drawn into the compelling narrative of Days Gone. Deacon's journey through loss, survival, and redemption kept me emotionally invested throughout the game. The complex and relatable characters, along with the exploration of profound themes, added depth and resonance to the overall experience.

2. Expansive Open World: The post-apocalyptic Oregon is a breathtaking setting that never ceased to amaze me. From dense forests and abandoned towns to treacherous highways and snow-covered mountains, the world of Days Gone felt incredibly vast and diverse. The developers' attention to detail, coupled with dynamic weather effects and a day-night cycle, created an immersive environment that I loved exploring.

3. Thrilling Survival Gameplay: Days Gone masterfully blends various gameplay elements to deliver an intense and immersive survival experience. The constant need to scavenge for resources, craft essential items, and manage my motorcycle, affectionately named ""my trusty steed,"" added a layer of realism and urgency to the gameplay. Every encounter with hostile humans or ravenous Freakers demanded strategic thinking, and the vast array of weapons and traps at my disposal allowed for a variety of playstyles.

4. Epic Horde Battles: The adrenaline-fueled horde battles in Days Gone were nothing short of exhilarating. The sheer scale of these encounters, with hundreds of Freakers swarming relentlessly, left me on the edge of my seat. Planning my attack, utilizing the environment to my advantage, and witnessing the chaos unfold as explosions rocked the battlefield were some of the most memorable moments in the game. These intense battles truly tested my skills and provided a sense of accomplishment when successfully overcoming the odds.

5. Stunning Visuals and Immersive Sound Design: Days Gone's visual presentation was simply stunning. The attention to detail in the environments, character models, and atmospheric effects left me in awe. The post-apocalyptic landscapes were hauntingly beautiful, and the grotesque yet intricately animated Freakers added to the sense of danger and unease. The game's haunting soundtrack and meticulous sound design further heightened the immersion, creating a spine-chilling atmosphere that kept me engaged from start to finish.

Cons:

1. Slow Pacing in the Beginning: While Days Gone ultimately delivers an unforgettable experience, it must be noted that the game starts with a relatively slow pace. The lengthy prologue may feel somewhat tedious, as it takes its time to establish the story and introduce the mechanics. However, I urge players to be patient, as the narrative picks up its pace and the game gradually unfolds into an engrossing adventure.

2. Repetitive Side Missions: Although the main story missions in Days Gone offered unique and engaging experiences, some of the side missions and activities suffered from repetitive objectives. Clearing out enemy camps or rescuing hostages often felt like variations of the same tasks. While they provided opportunities to further explore the world and gain valuable resources, the lack of variety in objectives occasionally became monotonous.

3. Occasional Technical Issues: During my playthrough, I encountered a few technical hiccups. Although Bend Studio has worked diligently to address these issues through updates and patches, occasional frame rate drops and minor glitches did momentarily disrupt my immersion.",1687617281,1687617281,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No riveting story right off the bat, the controls seemed clunky and it seemed like every other open world, third-person, zombie game. The graphics were decent but the PS4 Pro didn't do it justice. This game was Graphically advanced, more so than what the times would allow on consoles. 

Fast forward to the PC launch. After seeing the game on sale multiple times. I finally bought the game for $20 bucks when i saw the reviews were overwhelmingly positive. I felt as though I was missing out on a gem and I hadn't given it a fair shake or maybe this is its better form. Regardless, I do not regret my purchase. I would have gladly paid full price. This game has tons to do. Some tasks are repetitive but much like the Outposts in Far Cry. Each one is unique and fun, although they are the same tasks. The game is quite lengthy too. Game play is actually really tight. Motorcycle controls are stellar, too. 

3 big things that made this game for me. 

1. The story is unpredictable in the best way. I will be watching a cut scene, anxious about what might go sideways for Deacon. But sometimes, things do go exactly as planed. It's a nice shake up from literally EVERYTHING going wrong all the time. The dialogue can sometimes feel in-cohesive or out of pocket. After playing the game and learning the personalities of the different characters, you start to understand that they don't communicate as though someone wrote the script. It seems more ad lib or natural. Like how real people, with no script, talk and communicate. Not gonna win an Oscar but it's a really nice change of pace. 

2. The Hordes. Frankly, they are incredible. 100-200 Freakers, rushing at you. Relentlessly chasing you down. Attempt the Hordes early on, in my opinion, for the most fun. They do become softer targets when you progress into the late game. Massive amounts of fun and there are a lot of them to do post game as well. 

3. The graphics and the Porting quality, especially after experience The Last of Us gave us, are top tier. This game was meant to run on PC. Unlike a lot of PC ports, there isn't an overwhelming amount of graphics options but the game looks and runs beautiful. I do have a really high end rig but very few crashes and very bugs. 

Bend Studio, if you all see this, I know its relatively implausible, but if y'all can make a 2nd game happen, please do. 

If you have hesitations, take a risk, wait for it to go on sale if you have to. Give the game a few hours. It's definitely a late bloomer. 

My Rig:
Ryzen 7800x3D
Radeon RX 7900 XTX
32GB GDDR4 RAM

I get a stable 250-300 FPS at 1440p cranked to Ultra or Highest.

It keeps a reasonable balance between challenge and fun throughout the majority of the story.  As one would expect from the promotional material, the game has a big focus on fighting a few massive hordes rather than many skirmish scale encounters, though smaller scale fighting is present in some capacity.  The combat is pretty good, and unlike other similar titles, actually has meaningfully diverse set of tools available to the player. Admittedly, players who decide to complete all available side activities will inevitably have their character become the usual late game Gary Sue, but it does take a fairly long time to get to that point. On the topic of characters, they are decently well written. The main character falls under the painfully generic bastard with a heart of gold archetype, but that being said, he is still interesting. In contrast, the supporting cast are very unique, with vastly different personalities. Most importantly, they all serve an actual, meaningful purpose in the story that goes beyond just being interesting. The game takes between 40 and well over 100 hours to complete depending on how much hordes, bandit camps and side quests you can complete before your eyes start to glaze over.

Your weapons upgrade and allow you to take on bigger and bigger hordes. Enemies get tougher. Deacon gets stronger, a lot stronger.

By the half way point you start feeling really comfortable. No more ""oh know theres a horde better come back later"" but rather ""ok, im full on ammo, got some pipe bombs...let's give this one a go"".

I like the end of the world vibe and the way they handle the zombie lore.  It feels kind of like a red dead redemption style game but harder and with zombies.  My three favorite things about it were:
1. The story
2. The first time I encountered a horde
3. The military / biker theme

The three things I disliked were
1. Too hard at first
2. some choices in the story would have been nice
3. My favorite rifle in the game, the 50 cal BMG, though it looks real it doesn't have the recoil you would expect which is distracting

On the whole I say buy it, worth it full price and it's a steal if you get it on sale.  I hope they make a sequel although they kinda don't have to because the story feels complete at the end.

One thing I'd like to mention about the story without giving too much detail.  I can't avoid all detail though so if you cant handle the tiniest of spoilers I've saved this for the end of my review.  

******* tiniest of spoilers below *********

There is a section in the game that involves military salutes.  As a vet I know how salutes are supposed to work.  There are details to it that the public can be excused for being ignorant of.  It annoyed me that the characters kept doing it wrong.  However, in a particular scene where only vets are present the salute is finally done correctly.  That scene rearranged my whole opinion about it.  Instead of conveying ignorance on the part of the dev it transformed it into a part of the story.  The writer was giving a subtle nod to the small percentage of players who would see and understand the difference.  I really liked that.",1686529622,1687221042,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a gamer of 50+ years, I can confidently say it's one of the best games I've ever played. From its stunning visuals to its gripping story line and immersive game play, it's a masterpiece that deserves high praise.

The graphics in Days Gone are breathtaking, showcasing lush forests and desolate urban areas with remarkable detail. The open-world setting allows for freedom and exploration, making every excursion feel like a genuine struggle for survival. The dynamic weather system adds realism, intensifying the sense of danger lurking around every corner.

Playing as Deacon St. John, a rugged bounty hunter, I became invested in his personal journey through this brutal post-pandemic world. The narrative skillfully weaves together themes of survival, loss, and redemption, keeping me engaged from start to finish. The well-developed characters and emotional storytelling left a lasting impact.

Combat in Days Gone is intense and satisfying, especially when facing hordes of zombie-like creatures known as Freakers. The game offers a variety of strategies and weapons, allowing for adaptability in different situations. It's a thrilling experience that keeps you on your toes.

One aspect that truly sets Days Gone apart is the bond formed with Deacon's motorcycle. It goes beyond mere transportation, becoming a trusted companion in the midst of chaos. Customization options and attention to detail make the motorcycle feel like a lifeline, symbolizing survival and freedom in a harsh world. This unique relationship adds depth and emotional attachment to the game play.

While the cancellation of Days Gone 2 is disappointing news, it doesn't take away from the incredible experience the first game offers. Days Gone will forever hold a special place in my gaming memories.

TL:DR review - 
--------------
Super fun open world zombie survival game with brilliant gameplay mechanics and zombie hordes(like hundreds of them. And they sprint at you).
Decent story, excellent audio. Beautiful open world with lots of things to do and places to explore. Must play.
 
 Long review:-
 ---------------
 Remember when AMC's walking dead TV show came out in 2010 and it was so good and fresh because it was something people hadn't seen before. Following that, every
 year there have been countless zombie based movies and games. Some good, some bad and some very very generic. But only a handful of these captured the magic of the
 original AMC's TV show(the 1st season atleast). Days Gone manages to do that beautifully.
 
 The opening 3-4 hours of this game is nothing short of exceptional and is an excellent hook. Towards the middle of the game, there is a bit of a slowdown because you get 
 some search and rescue type missions/clear camp missions which might put some people off. But then it picks up again and there is a slowdown again before the final act of the game.
 This is quite a long game(took me around 55 hours to complete) and I love doing most of the side missions and stuff in games like these so I did most of it. Skipped some stupid questlines like\
 clear out 42 zombie bird nests(like...no,thank you).

 Pros:-
--------
 1.) Opening act - The opening 5-ish hours of the game is just a brilliant experience and is a great hook for you to completely immerse yourself in this world.
 2.) Audio - Excellent audio design. Intense music which raises your pulse while fighting hordes, suspenseful music while exploration, upbeat music in combat. The only place where audio was a bit meh, was where there was a speech cutscene and you could hear the background character's chatter over the lead person giving the speech. Minor mixing issue.
 3.) Open world -  The open world they have crafted here looks amazing and it feels even more thrilling exploring this world with its abandoned complexes, tunnels,caves,jungles. The environmental design is quite honestly phenomenal. Brilliantly captures the post apocalyptic vibe with immobilized vehicles, destroyed barricades, abandoned rescue camps, derailed trains  etc. Its really enjoyable to explore and I loved
 every minute of it.
 4.) Environmental Design - Brilliant. As good as environment design in Last of Us.
 5.) Hordes - This is one of the most exhilarating experiences in any zombie game ever made. Imagine a pack of 50-500 zombies running at you full sprint and you having to outrun, shoot, manage stamina, use the environment to guide them into choke points, blow them up while not getting cornered or pincered by the pack. Think Dying Light 1's night zombie chases but on steroids. It is absolutely insane fighting hordes in this game.
And there are some hordes which you cannot tackle early game at all simply because you don't have the resources to do so. Yes, you can cheese some of them through youtube video techniques but that cheapens the experience imo. 
Anyway, hordes in this game -> Insanely fun experience. Fun, Tough and gets your blood flowing.
 6.) Enemy Variety - Wolves, Infected Wolves, Infected crows, Bears, Infected bears, humans(unarmored enemies in early-mid game to armored enemies late game), normal zombies, tougher normal zombies, screamers(calls other zombies to your location),newts(kid zombies annoying af), brute zombies, runner zombies etc. Good enemy variety. Did not have any complaints with this. 
 7.) Characters - The protagonist is basically a dude being shoved into leadership positions when he clearly isn't a leader. And that is fine, there are people in the world like this and its okay for a game to have a character who isn't an uber macho perfect born leader leaking testosterone out of his eyes. But yes, there are quirks to his character and he does grow somewhat throughout the game(though not as much as I would have liked). The side characters are good too.
While they too aren't perfect, they are extremely believable characters. You have the idealist camp leader dude, the conspiracy theorist camp leader dude, the slave labourer camp leader lady, the sleazy scumbag
""bro"" character who lies while smiling and shaking your hand, you have the bisexual badass chick who is interested in you, the religious nutjob, a militant with a gob complex etc etc. Very nice, believable characters.
The world isn't perfect and neither are the people in them. 
 8.) Gameplay - As Tuco Salamanca said.. "" Tight! Tight! Tight!"". No seriously, inventory wheel, weapons, gunplay, character movement felt fine and well done. Would have preferred a bit more variety with melee but thats okay.
 9.) The Bike - While this is also technically, gameplay, I'm making a separate point for this because with the amount of effort and maintenance you put into the bike it is basically a character in its own right.You start off with a real broken down mess of a gas guzzling fragile vehicle which you upgrade throughout the course of the game and end up with some really nice wheels(for an apocalyptic world) by the end. It serves as your mobile quicksave station, your limited ammo refill station(if you have bought saddlebags for the bike). The bike can run out of fuel and you can get stranded at someplace with no fuel pump or fuel can nearby. Very nice mechanic with the bike and how the devs have integrated the vehicle in the gameplay. 
 10.) Goes to some difficult places - There are some missions which tackle really difficult societal and philosophical topics like drug abuse, loss, sparing someone through death etc. That was a nice touch.
				
Cons:-
1.) Deacon's Code - The protagonist, Deacon St.John lives by a code which is reinforced again and again through the game that he doesn't like people who ""kill unarmed women"". Though it is never explained exactly why he has this very specific code especially as he kills probably hundreds of female goons over the course of the game(most of them are armed but hey some of them he sneaks up on). This feels like a character just having a code to live by for the sake of having a code to live by as a protagonist because thats the cool thing to do. This felt jarring and out of place to be honest.
2.) Some specific missions - There are a few missions where you have to go check up/talk to certain characters and they just say one line like ""I'm fine. I have to go.""/""Get outta here. I have work to do."" and the mission just ends. This felt incredibly annoying and ridiculous but thankfully there are only like 3 or 4 of these missions in the whole game.
3.) Pacing issue - Before midgame and post midgame the game is bogged a bit by some pacing issues mostly due to camp clearing missions etc. 
4.) Irrelevant choices and No choices - There are some choices you make early game which result in basically...nothing. And some choices you make early game seem like they would be available again later in the game but you never get that option again in the game in similar scenarios. Fairly linear game in terms of story progression which is completely fine but then why have us making choices in the first place? Seems like a bit of a missed opportunity here. Mid-late game choices basically boils down to you rescuing survivors and deciding which camp they go to based on which camp you are trying to max out or need reputation/money in. They could have done so much more with the camps.

Overall, a very very fun and engaging experience and a must play.",1687082813,1687082813,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Buy the game, with or without sale because it is definitely the most underrated game of all Playstation Studios games released on PC.

Having seen some of the gameplay from the original launch on console, Days Gone instantly became one of those games that i wished one day would come to PC, so i could get it, although at the time it didnt seem likely.

You can imagine how happy i was when Sony announced the release of the game on PC, even though i took my time to buy the game and after buying it, then i took my sweet ass time to finish it (completionist curse, i knew the game would immerse me) and surprise, it most certaintly did.

This game is a true gem and very immersive once you get the hang of the gameplay. The story itself is really great if you give it a chance and dont just give up like some woke reviewers lol. 

Yes, it starts slow but once it picks up steam and you start putting the pieces together of the various storylines in the game by not just following the main story quests but also exploring the side quests and going after the collectibles in the regions, you will find that most of the characters are multi layered, interesting and their backgrounds shape who they are in the post apocalyptic world.

Specially the main character, he maybe seem boring and generic at first, but believe me, there are so many layers to this dude that i think its worth actually reading through the storyline entries and just seeing how he changes throughout the game to see that he is probably one of the most complex and real protagonists in a video game.

Plus there is a ton of meaningful and engaging side content, activities and collectibles for the all the completionists out there, that will be sure to keep you entertained with the game for a long time, i clocked over 100hr, because i would sometimes be AFK with the game open or just scouring the map for hordes (you will enjoy them), but still you definitely get your moneys worth either way.

The entire gameplay and UI, the combat, the characters, the animations, the AI and the map design and attention to details puts Days Gone on a level of quality that i feel that the reviews didnt give it justice.

In conclusion, i fully recommend you getting this game and let yourself be immersed in this world and its characters, you will surely have hours of pure fun and adventure.

Now, all that remains is for us to wait for Sony to wake up and deliver justice by giving us a sequel to the game, because the developers at Bend Studios worked their asses off and surely deserve it.",1687037295,1687037295,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay varies enough to keep things interesting -- fighting a horde, running down a drifter on a bike, and clearing out an ambush camp all require different strategies.

The freakers, woof. It's like playing 28 Days Later: the game. They're fast, agile, and even one of them can mess you up if you're not careful. It's a miracle anyone survived at all in this game's world, because these zombies are dangerous as hell.

From a technical standpoint, it runs like buttah for me... No stuttering, no texture popping, no fps drops. Once in a while Iron Mike's face stays in medium detail when it's a close up scene, but no loss there.

I've heard people complain about Deek himself, that he's too unlikable and the whole biker thing shouldn't be romanticized.
Honestly, I don't think those people know the difference between a protagonist and a hero. Deek is the protagonist, but he's not heroic. Someone in the game says it: when the apocalypse comes, the good people won't make it... Only the thieves, murderers, and dirt bags will survive.
And yeah, almost every character is kind of a dirt bag on some level. 

Days Gone isn't the first game to have an unlikable protagonist either... Alan Wake, the Last of Us 1 and 2. Morally complicated characters are more interesting, that's it.
And I think having the game in third person also helps the player separate themselves enough to say ""I'm playing through this guy's story, even if I don't agree with everything he does.""

Besides, what, do you want to play as Leon Kennedy in every game? Boring.

One thing I'll say is that it's half-annoying half-hilarious when I'm sneaking Deek into an enemy camp and he just starts yelling at the top of his lungs. Like dude, shut up.

The mechanics are superficially slowed down during the first part of the game (like a small gas tank).  Controls are also somewhat sluggish and nowhere near as tight as say Horizon Zero Dawn.  I guess that's by design to create more tension with the zombies.

The next 15 hours, after figuring out all the systems and getting fast travel, things started moving but - at that point - I was really just playing to see what happened with the story.  But at this point, some of the story lines start converging in interesting ways.  The story is also told very cohesively, like Last of Us or RD2, and that made me want to keep powering through.  Still, the game would've been a 5/10 at this point.

The last 15 hours, the story line takes off in cinematic ways that really bring you into the game, again in ways like the Last of Us did.  The difficultly also ramps up significantly at this point and starts throwing entire hoards at you and these missions were incredibly challenging for me, but very satisfying to complete.  The game gives you a lot of mechanics which you can also ignore, which was nice.  The game was 30% too long in my opinion but the ending and challenging end missions made the story something to remember.  Last 15 hours is a 10/10 so I guess I went from hating this to recommending as a must play.",1686877462,1686877462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
- Bad ass motorcycle
- A zombie game where 3+ zombies can be a threat
- Hordes of over 100 zombies that you can run in to at a moments notice
- Characters that conceptually make sense
- A gas mechanic that's okay enough for a video game
- Nero checkpoints and those megaphones

That's honestly it. To keep this short and spoiler free, I'd only recommend this game to someone who really wants to play another zombie game.

Time to go in. Spoilers ahead.

The story in this game is outright atrocious. It very clearly has intent, but its like 10 writers were given a story board, all individually made their own ideas, and never talked to each other to smooth things out. 

We play as Deacon, a character we know nothing about but slowly learn more about through the story and, in a weird way, turns out he kinda sucks as a person. He has a vibe of compensatory masculinity and attempted edginess, with a hint of ""men don't talk about their feelings"" to avoid any real character depth. On top of that, his past is never really clearly explained. This could be forgivable, if it wasn't used as a major plot point. The first real bad guy you find in the game, Carlos (Jessie), is an old biker buddy of Deacon and Boozer, and apparently you two and some guy named Jack held him down and burned off his back, which is why he hates you and wants revenge. Why did they do this? I never really got an in-game explanation. There are answers on the wiki, but I saw plenty of blog posts of people asking the same question; so my guess is it's not included naturally in the story telling. Either way, a confusing bit of the story, although the least offensive. 

Some other examples of terrible writing is the the relationship between Rikki and Addison. Rikki is a character which Deacon has a history with (of course no detail or depth is given) and is in a relationship with Addison. The game seems to put in work to create a dramatic situation between the three, as Rikki likes Deacon, Addison is becoming jealous as Rikki's behavior is changing, and Deacon's best friend Boozer was just saved by Addison. Seems like the recipe for a juicy camp conflict or some external/internal character conflict. What happens? Nothing. Rikki flirts with deacon once, Deacon shoots her down, nothing happens. Deacon doesn't even give a reason for why he shoots down Rikki. Does he still have hope for his wife? Still feel committed to her? Does he feel guilty about betraying the woman who saved his best friend? Is he his own cock block? (yes) We don't know and nothing ever comes of the situation. However, this is one of the reasons why I said there was clearly intent before. At the scene where Rikki flirts with Deacon, we get a camera shot of Skizzo (a sleezy untrustworthy guy) seeing us from outside the window, and what appears to be a set up for him having blackmail on us, or just the ability to start trouble if he wants. This scene was literally pointless. It's inclusion means nothing, it's never touched on, and as far as I'm aware was left in by mistake because they decided to axe the love drama.

Two more writing examples and I'll move on. Deacon and his wife, Sarah. Deacon has been morning her to a point of being suicidal. When he gets a lead on her potentially being alive, it absolutely enlivens him and (understandably) becomes his main focus. He eventually finds her after two or so years of thinking each other is dead and we get... nothing. A ""Wow you're alive?"" A kiss. Then ""here's a clipboard, go risk your life for some flowers or some shit."" Deacon and Sarah never really talk about things even when given opportunities, Sarah never expresses some internal conflict at sending her husband to his potential death over and over again, and Deacon seems cool with his wife having become a completely different person from who he remembers and takes her ""I don't want to talk about it"" as sufficient. The characters in porno have more personality than this. At least I could believe Dee Williams might be someone's mom. I dont think Sarah even knows shes married.

Lastly, the research center. An apocalypse utopia. Running water, farm land, electric fences. You'd try to move right in, right? At least claim it? Nope. Lost Lake gives 0 fucks. Deacon literally radios them about the place. Nada. Dont hear anything about them going to harvest the corn or any banter about ""we should probably move in to that fortified building with solar panels and is self automated that would be a dream to live it."" In fact, when Deacon calls Rikki about it, she literally sounds sarcastic cause she's still bitter he went and found his wife, I guess? ""Hey Rikki I found the jackpot that is really gonna help the camp"" ""Oh yeah? thats soooo cool but I don't care to talk to you."" Like damn bitch sorry I'm too busy ""lighting candles"" with my wife, loser. Go spit metaphors at the veterinarian you tried to cheat on and quit judging me.

Aw shit. I said that last paragraph was last for writing.. which it is. But what the fuck happened to that little girl you saved? She really did go and fuck off huh? Same with O'Brian. Fuck me for being interested in any of these characters I guess. My fault for wanting story in a single player game.

On to annoying mechanics.

To start, dialogue. It was not uncommon for me to miss out on some seemingly important dialogue. Regularly, when going with an NPC to a location, the dialogue the characters share is twice as long as it takes to get there, so if you want to hear it you'll have to sit and park (very fun gameplay btw). There are also many times someone would call Deacon, and that call would then be interrupted by another voice line or the starting of a mission, so the call would cancel itself and I'd never hear it again. Sometimes a call would start when you're already mid conversation so your balancing listening to two people at once. Maybe this is where the important explanation of Jack and Jessie happen, and I missed it.

Helping survivors. This really shows the refinement (or lack there of) of the game. I helped about nine survivors. I saw two player models. Pretty pathetic. There was even an event that happened on the bridge of Lost Lake, where a guy was being held by bandits (Lost Lake really didn't seem to care about the guy outside screaming for help). I free'd him, and told him to go to Lost Lake, he says thanks, and then he runs in the opposite direction where I watch him despawn in ten feet.

The sniper ambushes. Fucking fuck these shits. These guys could snipe a specific sperm in a sea of jizz faster than Hawkeye can get cucked by The Hulk. No matter how fast you go on your bike, or if their laser is even pointed in your direction, your bike will be one shot and you will fly off. When I see the laser I literally cant stop fast enough to get off my bike before this random teenager with a Faze scholarship 360 no scopes me. It's not a ""challenging mechanic"" it's just annoying.

I could go on but this review is long enough and I'm tired. If you read this far you already know if you want the game or not. Thank you for reading my rant. The game wasnt a complete waste of time, but again, only recommend if you're really looking for another zombie game.

I agree with everyone who says it was underrated or unfairly panned by gaming press at launch, but I also didn't have to deal with launch bugs. It's fun and stable now, with only a few minor visual and audio bugs experienced during gameplay-- with the exception of a fast travel that spawned me well underneath the map terrain at the very end of my playthrough. 

Sam Witwer is again a VG lead (I think he was the lead char in Force Unleashed?) and there are some really idiosyncratic and even strange acting choices here that run through the whole game. Overacting, inconsistent volume and delivery, and straight up weirdness in a lot of the open world voice work. But put Deacon on screen with other characters during cinematics and some moments are brilliant. He carries the game well and the actors around him hold up to that level of performance. The cinematics and the open world performances don't always coincide well but it's a minor gripe.

The story is standard zombie fare, no real innovation here. Some consipiracy theory nonsense, anti-Government sentiment (those damn Feds at FEMA, I mean NERO, they made the virus! LOL) are sprinkled over the by-the-numbers zombie narrative layer cake of hunt for the maybe-dead-wife while you survive in the humans-are-the-real-monsters wasteland--tropes that are so time worn its basically a smooth pebble of a premise. But like most zombie properties, if you do the human stories right it can prop up the aging genre stuff enough to work, and I feel like it does here. Boozer's great, and Deek is fun to inhabit even when/if you don't completely sympathize/empathize.

If I have a major complaint it's the pacing of the story and gameplay. It's really uneven. Some of the best weapons won't unlock until endgame or after, and you won't be able to fight hordes and track them on the map until you get through a big chunk of story. The story is at times too slow to develop, skills feel too slow to unlock, and if you're a completionist you will be dealing with some repetition that causes a dip in the middle of the game that might cause folks to put the game down. Once the story picks up, it's well worth it, so I say if you commit to it it pays off. It would've been better to have intermingled the main story with some side stories in a more organic way, or to unlock horde fights earlier or scatter them around the early game in a more interesting way. 

There are some really cool emergent encounters that pop up, and once you kite around entire hordes you can destroy them in creative ways. Sometimes. Other times the hordes are just plopped on the open map and you don't have any choice other than kite them around.

Looking at the later weapons that unlock, it makes me wonder if there were DLC plans or store plans that got scrapped and the items were sort of peppered into the late game. Uncertain, total conjecture. It just feels a little microtransaction-y even though they're not that. It's frustrating to be almost completely done horde hunting and/or completely done with the game and then they drop a cool new weapon on you. I guess it could be bait to try NG+ as well, but I think there are better ways to time out unlockable upgrades than what they settled on.

Upgrading the bike is satisfying, riding is mostly a pleasure save a few instances of *ridiculous* and unintentionally hilarious terrain/geometry collision. I think the game devs could've increased their sales and player retention by adding this one thing, this one simple thing:  [i] Let us strap a single-use gas can onto the back of our bike. [/i] It would be helpful to have a lil extra gas for when you get caught in the middle of nowhere or you fast travel a little too much without calculating cost. I didn't mind the gas resource or scrap resource otherwise, though it does take a little too long to upgrade them to the point where you feel somewhat free of the mechanic. But knowing to coast downhill to save gas and the ability to coast downhill silently on the bike is a glorious thing, one of my favorite mechanics in the game. If you can get above your objective, you can sneak up really close to them and have your bike, with its ammo sacks and quicksave ability, right nearby. Very cool. And some missions force you to advance from below or find a way around, forcing you to leave your bike behind. It's great. But sometimes you lose your bike and want to recall it and it's like ""bike is too far away,"" like, bish, I know it's far away that's why I'm trying to recall it! And every now and again a mission pops up that says ""you must have a working bike nearby"" so you go and get your bike and then it's like ""your bike doesn't have enough fuel,"" like, okay, this will be a chase mission you have spoiled all surprise AND now I have to go get gas. Pfffft. Why not just have the gas stop being spent during that lil side mission, they do that for the story missions so it's already part of the game to suspend gas usage for certain moments. But no I have to leave and come back with more gas. Boo. Only happens a few times but still.

Late game resources get way too scarce (you will use tons of resources to smash hordes). It would've been great to open up a shop that sells kerosene or growlers near the endgame so you don't have to scavenge as much. I get why they didn't, but keeping me out scavenging on hour 10 is very different than forcing me out scavenging on hour 50-- so why not save me some time? They put a trunk out here and there where you'll get some ammo and mollys but starving for growlers right after you unlock the thing feels like forced scarcity to stretch the game out.

I don't agree that it's a masterpiece because of the pacing. There are moments that feel artificially drawn out or like they wanted to stretch the content and that's my biggest complaint. For a AAA open-worlder you can do worse and you can do better-- but will there be zombie hordes and will you ride a motorcycle? This game has that hook and it works. After finishing the story I kept going to clear some missions and finish things up-- I felt like I wasn't quite ready to leave the world of the game as I'd found it fun. That's a good measure and ultimately it makes me feel like, yeah, pretty good game. Pick it up on sale and enjoy.",1686705577,1686705577,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Legendary characters, you learn and develop with them. Man - just mind blowing.

Especially since you can customize it how you want, made me feel like a real biker going crazy when someone fucks with my bike.

This game made me tear up, it made me laugh, and it made me jump a few times! (These godamn wolves)

It's the only game so far who I enjoyed playing thoroughly, from doing all the side quests and picking up all the collectibles.

However, I don't really follow any gaming news or what happens with studios and developers, so after my jaw dropped at the ""secret ending"" I had to go look if there will be a sequel and I was very disappointed with what has happened and the chances of it existing.

Horrendous dialogue and writing for a start, it is not remotely clear (particularly at the start of the game) why things happen... they just do, like youll just get a mission telling you youve decided something but no dialogue before this explaining this decision. WTF. The story is ok but a lot of the character relationships are not convincing at all imo. IDK how it can be so heavy handed on the central romance and still fuck it up. Furthermore, a lot of the side content is repetitive af, particularly the bandit camps and those fucking nests you need to burn to move. Just why. HOWEVER, the gameplan is fun. I like riding big bike, making hoard and making zombles go boom. Thats really it tbh. Quite telling that a game with so much wrong with it imo, can still be so engaging cas the story is atleast ok and the gameplay is really good.

Graphics:  9/10
Gunplay:  4/10
Gameplay:  4/10
Story: 4/10

 In the dark, grim future of a parallel world, human ingenuity, perseverance and spirit have died. Most of the surviving people now live in concentration camps. Those outside of the camps are outlaws, who can be killed on sight.

 You play as Dick Johnson, a (N.E.R.O.) genetically deformed biker, who earns the favor of the camp tyrants by murdering other outlaws and destroying infected people, called freakers.

 His life purpose was serving his wife, but now he is just trying to get by, one day at a time. Join the servant of Sara in this exciting post-corporation world where the main enemy of mankind are not the hundreds of millions of infected, but a Christian man leading a couple of hundred people.

 Pro:
[b]-[/b] great graphics
[b]-[/b] it’s fun to ride around with the motorcycle
[b]-[/b] the motorcycle can be upgraded, performance wise and visually
[b]-[/b] interesting open world, ready to be explored
[b]-[/b] freaks form “hordes”, which can be interesting to fight
[b]-[/b] a relatively decent selection of weapons
[b]-[/b] near seamlessly integrated story scenes into the gameplay
[b]-[/b] good story progression
[b]-[/b] mods can improve the gaming experience (visual and content wise)
[b]-[/b] the “challenge” gameplay mode gives bonuses for story play, making it worthwhile to complete them
[b]-[/b] you can level up all the skills
[b]-[/b] there is a game plus mode, that carries over weapons and skills from a previous (saved) gameplay

Contra:
[b]-[/b] no first person view
[b]-[/b] riding with the motorcycle alerts enemies in a wide area, so you’ll likely be on foot more often than not while exploring
[b]-[/b] whistling doesn’t recall the motorcycle to your location
[b]-[/b] resource management simulation on hardest difficulties, you are always short on fuel, ammo, other things
[b]-[/b] while hordes can be fun to fight, smaller groups of enemies end up being tedious to fight after a while as you don’t profit much from destroying them, yet you might use a lot of resources to destroy them
[b]-[/b] despite the many weapons, game mechanics make it so that only a few are actually worth using (very limited ammunition)
[b]-[/b] there is no official mod support
[b]-[/b] combat mechanics are quite primitive and get boring relatively quickly

[b]********************[/b]
 [b][u]CONTENT WARNING[/u][/b]:
[b]-[/b] game is openly anti-Christian
[b]-[/b] game promotes transhumanism/feminism/gender ideology (“enhancement” of people with “gene therapy”, no difference between men and women)
[b]-[/b] game data mines your information, allegedly even using a keylogger

Rating: ★★★★☆

Days Gone offers a gripping and immersive gaming experience, blending an intriguing story, unexpected plot twists, and rich game world content. From the moment you embark on this post-apocalyptic adventure, you'll find yourself captivated by its narrative and drawn into a world teeming with danger and mystery.

One of the standout aspects of Days Gone is its engrossing story. As players assume the role of Deacon St. John, they are thrust into a world ravaged by a deadly pandemic, where humanity is on the brink of collapse. Deacon's personal journey as a former outlaw turned bounty hunter is filled with emotional depth and nuanced character development. You'll find yourself emotionally invested in his quest for redemption and survival, as he navigates through a desolate landscape filled with both human adversaries and the relentless Freakers.

What sets Days Gone apart is its ability to keep you on the edge of your seat with unexpected plot twists. Just when you think you've unraveled the secrets of this unforgiving world, the game throws unexpected curveballs that challenge your assumptions and keep you guessing. These twists not only add excitement but also provide a deeper layer of complexity to the narrative, ensuring that you're always eager to uncover the next revelation.

The game world content in Days Gone is vast, diverse, and incredibly detailed. The Pacific Northwest setting is beautifully realized, with sprawling forests, abandoned towns, and decaying structures that create a hauntingly atmospheric backdrop for your adventures. Exploring this world on Deacon's trusty motorcycle is a delight in itself, as you encounter breathtaking vistas, encounter dynamic weather systems, and stumble upon hidden secrets that add depth to the lore.

Furthermore, the game world is populated by various factions, each with their own motivations and conflicts. These factions provide engaging side quests and missions that further enrich the narrative and give you a glimpse into the struggles and survival instincts of the remaining survivors. Whether you're helping a struggling community or facing off against hostile enemies, the game world content keeps you engrossed and offers a sense of purpose beyond the main story.

In conclusion, Days Gone is a game that excels in delivering an intriguing story, unexpected plot twists, and rich game world content. It invites you to embark on a journey that will test your survival skills, challenge your assumptions, and leave you hungry for more. Despite its minor technical flaws, the game's immersive experience and captivating storytelling make it a must-play for fans of post-apocalyptic adventures.

First of all, I liked the game for its [u] graphics and optimization [/u]. A good open world with a lot of dangers lurking, with the game completely immersed in the ""world after"", excellent fights with hordes of zombies and enjoyable motorcycle riding gameplay, perfectly combined with a dynamic story. And also a good modernization of the motorcycle, from the engine to the design of the wheels. Pleasant shooting and aiming, there is a variety of weapons in the camps. Let's not forget about the large number of tasks throughout the game, a good level of detail, and easy character control. Excellent photo mode, very beautiful photos are obtained. The main character Deacon St. John, who was copied from the [b] actor Sam Witwer [/b], is ready to move mountains in order to find his beloved, wandering through the endless expanses of Adish, along with his brother Buhar, who was also copied from [b] actor Jim Pirrie [/b]",1685872252,1685872252,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A decent open-world game.  I am not particularly fond of the zombie genre, but I actually liked this one.  While the zombie aspect is a part of the world and plot, there is really more of a human v. human struggle.  Some of the missions got repetitive (like rescuing so-and-so who was kidnapped by marauders, etc.), but that's OK.  

The gun-play was good, I thought.   A good selection of realistic weapons are available gradually, and each camp has a slightly different set of offerings (obviously the better guns are later).  There is some crafting of weapons and health items, but it is kept pretty simple (which I liked).

The world/map is designed well.  The initial section is my least favorite:  the dense forest gives a creepy, claustrophobic feeling.  I preferred the more open atmospheres of the later parts of the maps.  Graphically, it looks nice.  

Play on normal difficulty was reasonable.  There were a few missions that required several attempts, and you are offered the ability to lower the difficulty if you fail a particular mission many times.  

I only experience one spot with a glitch....after a particular piece of NPC dialogue played, the game would crash.  I can't remember what I did to get past this, but whatever it was it wasn't a big deal.  Otherwise, the game played fine with no other technical issues.

In all, I was happy with this game.  I finished the main story in about 50 hrs playtime, although I certainly didn't do every side mission.",1685742442,1685742534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] Good [/h1]

+ This game is about the story. Flashbacks, dialogues, mission cutscenes etc. Take it as a story based game with zombies, not a shooter with few story elements. It's not L4D type of game. 

+ Main protagonist is a member of Mongrels biker club.

+ You can customize your bike (colors, visual parts and performance upgrades).

+ You can find crafting materials (bodies, cars, open spaces) and make bombs, melee weapons, healing items.

+ You can use stealth or assault approach in combat. There are bombs, mine, shotguns, crossbow, silencers etc.

+ Bike requires fuel (need to fine canister or pay mechanic) and repairs (scrap can be found in the world or pay mechanic)

+ It's an open world game. Some missions do have restrictions, when you can't leave mission area.

+ There side missions and activities, such as enemy ambushes, enemy camps, NERO locations etc.

+ Graphics is good. Even better with Reshade. 

+ K&M controls are good. I play it this way. It's not some shitty, lazy console leftovers for PC peasantry. (*Cough* Elden Ring).

+ Skill system. More damage for melee weapons, stamina gain in combat etc.

+ Health, Stamina and Focus upgrade via NERO injection.


[h1] Bad [/h1]

- Protagonist can't swim...

- Bike drains fuel too fast.

- No hunger, sleep or thirst system. Survival is limited to materials you collect for weapons and fuel.

The gameplay is very solid. The storyline was definitively well written. It has a great variety of guns, challenge modes, lots of side missions, fun vehicle missions, underrated stealth gameplay and superb voice acting.

After getting basically 100% of the game completed I had to have a look back at the reviews that slammed this game and I find them very questionable. The map of the game expands considerably as you progress through the impressively long story-line, so the reviewers who criticized the game world's ""lack of size"" probably didn't play the game past 8 hours lol.

As I completed the game on PC and achieved 100% completion, I can confidently say that it was an incredible experience from start to finish. The open-world setting is beautifully crafted, providing a vast and immersive environment to explore on my trusty motorcycle.

The story-line is rich and engaging, keeping me invested in the fate of the protagonist, Deacon St. John, as he navigates the dangers of the pandemic-ridden world. The game's narrative is complemented by well-developed characters and surprising plot twists, making every interaction and mission meaningful.

Combat in Days Gone is intense and satisfying. Facing off against hordes of Freakers or hostile human factions required strategic thinking, resource management, and skillful execution. The variety of weapons and the crafting system added depth to the game-play, allowing me to adapt to different situations and experiment with different play-styles.

One aspect that truly stood out was the dynamic weather system and day-night cycle. It added a layer of realism and immersion, impacting both the game-play mechanics and the overall atmosphere of the game.

On the technical side, the PC version of Days Gone performed admirably. The graphics were stunning, and the controls felt responsive and smooth. I encountered minimal bugs or issues, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience.

Overall, Days Gone is a must-play for fans of open-world action-adventure games. Its compelling story, challenging game-play, and immersive world make it a standout title.

    There could have been more content and it seems like the devs planned for more and just never put it in. Progression is very linear and there were times when I was just waiting for the next step. And the good stuff comes so late in the game that I never even used it.

The more I played it the more i became captivated by it. 
The more skilled I became in eliminating human and infected enemies the more I wanted a fight.
The more I upgraded my bike to more I wanted to go out riding.

The Characters and the artistry are amazing, I was really immersed in the storyline and it was really great to ride down the post apocalyptic scene of Oregon state.

The music - When riding lonely on the roads - really cool country music, 
when fighting - good combat music and my favourite the HORDE alert/ fight theme.

Does it get repetitive? it sure does at points but to be fair even tho i stopped at every new enemy camps and took time to do side quests still it took me around 60 hours to complete the game and still there is a massive post game for ppl who like to gather trophies.

The story is definitely well-written for a zombie game and the action is intense especially on late game. For some reason, this game reminds me of RDR2 but with zombies and that is in a good way.

PROS:

* Immersive story with interesting characters
* Zombie hordes will no doubt give you that video game adrenaline
* Bike customization is cool
* The skill tree is fair but I wish there are post-game content where you'll become OP
* The way that the missions are designed is really good. You'll be given the option to choose which story mission you want to complete first. I wish more open world games adapt to this in the future so we can have more freedom

CONS:

* Just like in RDR2, there will be a lot of missions where you don't have any choice but to ride along an NPC from point A to point B without any choice but to listen to them talking. The good thing is, when you're alone, you can fast travel to the objective
* Expect some open world bugs. Majority of them are hilarious but there are some that can be frustrating. The good thing is there are no game breaking bugs
* Looting can be tiresome. You'll run out of materials quickly so you'll have no choice but to stop by some nearby house to collect supplies
* It's hard to 100% the game's achievements. There is a challenge mode where you'll have to spend a lot of time memorizing the layout of the area and supply locations
