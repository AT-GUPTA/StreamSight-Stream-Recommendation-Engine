Even if puzzle games aren't normally your thing, Portal is definitely worth trying at least once. Valve does a good job of slowly adding gameplay mechanics and introducing you to new puzzle solving strategies, so it wasn't overwhelming to learn but each level still provided a good challenge. 

Portal absolutely lives up to its reputation for smart writing. Glados' cutting remarks and deadpan delivery made me laugh out loud several times. The notes and drawings from other test subjects scattered around the levels were genuinely chilling. Despite the simplicity of its environments, Portal manages to acheive an impressively eerie atmosphere.

In terms of time commitment, you can finish this game in an afternoon. It took me just over 5 hours.

A couple of notes on accessibility:
1. The subtitle and UI text is pretty small. Play on a bigger screen if you can. 
2. Some puzzles rely heavily on precise timing and quick reflexes. This game will be difficult if you struggle with fine motor control.

Released in 2007 by Valve Corporation, this gem of a game has left an indelible mark on the gaming industry and the heart of players worldwide.
From the moment you step into the sleek, sterile chambers of Aperture Science, you're immediately drawn into a world where wit and intelligence reign supreme. The premise is simple yer captivating: armed with nothing but a portal gun, players navigate through a series of increasingly challenging test chambers devised by the enigmatic AI, GLaDOS.
What truly sets portal apart is its ingenious gameplay mechanics. The concept of creating interlinked portals to traverse seemingly insurmountable obstacles is nothing short of revolutionary. Every puzzle is meticulously crafted, requiring players to think critically, experiment with physics, and unleash their creativity to overcome each hurdle. The satisfaction of solving a particularly perplexing puzzle is unparalleled, and the ""aha!' moments are frequent and immensely rewarding.
But Portal isn't just about puzzles; it's also a testament to exceptional storytelling and memorable character. GLaDOS, with her sardonic wit and passive-aggressive demeanor, remains one of gaming's most iconic villains, while the silent protagonist, Chell, serves as the perfect foil to her antics. The sparse yet impactful narrative unfolds organically as players progress, keeping them invested in uncovering the secrets of Aperture Science.
Visually, Portal's minimalist aesthetic is timeless. The clean, futuristic design of the test chambers contrasts beautifully with the dilapidated corridors lurking behind the scenes, hinting at the darker truths lurking beneath the surface. Combined with a hauntingly atmospheric soundtrack, the game immerses players in its dystopian world, creating an atmosphere that is as captivating as it is unsettling.
Moreover, Portal's relatively short runtime is a testament to its impeccable pacing. Every moment feels purposeful, with no filler content to detract from the experience. And while the main campaign may be brief, the inclusion of challenge maps and a vibrant modding community ensures that the fun never truly ends.
In conclusion, Portal is a masterpiece of game design that has stood the test of time. its innovative gameplay, compelling narrative. and unforgettable characters have left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape, inspiring countless imitators but never quite being matched. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or a newcomer to the medium, Portal is an essential experience that deserves a place in every player's library.",1708885773,1708885773,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Portal. Portal.. Portal... A Valve classic made in 2007 which still holds up to this day. We all know it's one of the best puzzle games in our universe and sequel(Portal 2) is even better(MUST PLAY). I just don't need to say more.

In my opinion game is hard to 100% if you are trying to do it without any guide(u need 2 playthrougs and perfect play all challanges in game) but if you gonna watch youtube videos or something you only need to repeat movmement. Still it's hard to master but you can achieve all achievements. Go do that and check this guide for collectibles:

400,158425919,76561197979830493,1260,326,82,0,82,1704512904,"Portal, the iconic puzzle-platformer from Valve, has carved its own niche in the gaming hall of fame with its mind-bending mechanics, witty dialogue, and, of course, the infamous promise of [spoiler]a delicious reward – ""The Cake.""[/spoiler] As you traverse the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, it becomes apparent that the true portal isn't just a rift in space but a gateway to [spoiler]culinary curiosity[/spoiler].

From the moment you start gaining momentum in completing the tests/stages, players are hooked. The game brilliantly intertwines the quest for scientific achievement with the irresistible allure of [spoiler]a baked delicacy[/spoiler]. The cunning juxtaposition of sterile test chambers and the promise of [spoiler]a mouthwatering dessert[/spoiler] creates a tension that permeates the entire experience.

The narrative dances effortlessly between deceit and desire, much like the intricate portal jumps players execute throughout the game. The relentless pursuit of [spoiler]The Cake[/spoiler] parallels the player's relentless pursuit of answers, creating a [spoiler]confectionery-driven[/spoiler] symbiosis that is both clever and charming. The cleverness doesn't stop at the dialogue; it permeates the very fabric of the gameplay itself. Portal's puzzles mirror the layers of a perfectly baked cake, each chamber a tier waiting to be conquered. The satisfaction of solving each puzzle is not unlike the sweet victory of reaching the next stage in a baking recipe – precise, rewarding, and downright scrumptious.

However, the brilliance of Portal lies not just in its gameplay or witty banter but in the subversive twist that awaits players at the journey's end. As GLaDOS's true intentions unravel, so too does the [spoiler]illusion of The Cake[/spoiler]. The revelation that [spoiler]""The Cake is a Lie""[/spoiler] becomes a deliciously bitter pill to swallow, a narrative twist as delectable as it is unexpected.

In the end, Portal isn't just a game; it's [spoiler]a culinary adventure through the devious corridors of deception. The Cake, though elusive, becomes a symbol of the game's ingenuity[/spoiler] – a clever ruse that leaves players questioning not only the game's virtual reality but also their own hunger for sweet rewards. Valve has managed to craft a gaming experience where the line between reality and illusion is [spoiler]as thin as a slice of cake, [/spoiler] and the journey is as delightful as the destination is disappointing. I highly, highly recommend Portal. It frequently, like it is right now, goes as low as $0.99 when on sale. That's insanely cheap for the quality of game you're getting But let's talk more about the [spoiler]cake[/spoiler], shall we?

[spoiler]Cake, oh sweet, sweet cake, [/spoiler]the luscious promise that echoes through every corridor, every chamber, every pixel of this virtual wonderland. [spoiler]Cake, the tantalizing confection[/spoiler] that dances in the minds of players, a mirage of sweetness that beckons, teases, and, oh, how it haunts. [spoiler]Cake[/spoiler], the whispered desire that threads itself into the very fabric of the gaming experience, a sugary siren call that lures adventurers deeper into the labyrinth of GLaDOS's deceit.

[spoiler]Cake[/spoiler], that elusive temptation that fuels the player's every move, every portal jump, every puzzle-solving endeavor. [spoiler]Cake[/spoiler], the grand reward, the ultimate culmination of effort, skill, and cunning. [spoiler]Cake, a symphony of flavors waiting to explode on the taste buds, a divine creation that[/spoiler] exists both as a metaphorical mirage and a tangible obsession. [spoiler]Cake, the mirage that unravels into the harsh reality of lies and deceit, leaving players grasping at the crumbs of shattered dreams.[/spoiler]

But let's not forget [spoiler]the cake, oh no. Cake, the embodiment of victory, the embodiment of defeat. Cake. Cake, cake, cake – a chant that echoes through the corridors. Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake. Cake, cake. Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake.[/spoiler]

I know alredy many people did review on this thing, but it's dang good! with all of that mechanics and lore, and i dont know how Valve™ did such  a beast! In totally: NotCake/10

But know ending with small part of review, going onto bigger one

i'm going  to do through a few parts:
1:Gameplay
2:Graphics
3:Lore
4:Final Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GamePlay 

The gameplay of portal is quiet unique for me, starting in a room, and for time when it was released, the new physics of picking up items was interesting, but after a bit of room transfering and you get first part of portal gun (blue one) and from that point it gets quite interesting, the pazles in here are an another journey with quiet some intaractive stuff, and through all of the game it always keeps you in interest of what puzlles will be next, with always some other ways to complete them. Gamplay is git gud!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graphics

for the series of half-life (1;2), the Portal graphics was preety good, with shades,good textures,and sounds, i'm actualy surprised about the high quality of sounds, with every talk,step, and of course portal gun sound,overall high quality!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lore

just a quick note, i'm only going to talk about Portal 1 lore...
The Lore of Portal is quiet interesting, even in the start when you wake up in cryocapsule, and you dont know what is happening, with then strange voice saying instuctions to you, and all of your minds, where you dont understand anything, and just go through rooms and rooms, at the time where you ruining party:P you starting to finally understand what is going on, but when you first meet GLaDOS face-to-face it fills so magestic, but when you first time escape... good Lore!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final Notes

The thing about the cake and all of that stuff, where you know that CAKE IS A LIE CAKE IS A LIE CAKE IS A LIE...
The companion cube, it was the best friend of man, and woman, he never going to stub you in the back, will not talk to you, and will be nice for people who are introverts(Probably)

[b]The Good[/b]

+ Never-stale gameplay, that is immensely rewarding.
+ It's short, your time is not wasted whatsoever.
+ The story that develops through out the game gets is very interesting, and personally is a highlight to point here, it kept me engaged.
+ Simplicity, which is not always a bad thing, and definitely isn't here. The game was innovative in its time and the gameplay holds up really great, but coming from the current age of gaming, having a more uniform and straight forward gameplay was refreshing. You are not overwhelmed with a million mechanics and filler things to do, rather you have a captivating narrative here that is perfectly executed.
+ Beautiful soundtrack that compliments the game's atmosphere and ambience perfectly.

[b]The Bad[/b]

+ Difficulty on later levels is not perfectly paced, most likely just depends on the player's skill. Yet I found myself being confused on a level's direction for a while, and then the next one being really easy and short.

[b]Thoughts[/b]

An original and exceptional game. Valve being called one of the most innovative game studios, if not the most innovative game studio of all time is very much true, and it really shows with Portal. I was so pulled to this game, I went and finished it in one day, and I loved every second of it. It has brought back my love for puzzle games, and I cannot wait to play the highly praised sequel.

Completed 11 puzzles and had to stop to rest my brain.  Being afraid of heights I got freaked out at first but got used to it.  One thing they could improve is the game menu's - like the settings and such - they are bit small and hard to read.

Overall its a short game, some people claim that's why it's more fun. Personally if you had to chose one I would chose portal two though for it's length and just because I found it more funny and fun to complete. But it really is worth playing both, preferably in order if you can. If you are additionally going to play Aperture Desk Job (I haven't played Aperture Hand Lab so I won't yet speak on that), then I would recommencement playing the first two games, or at least the second game, before playing it. This game is definitely worth the money, whether you get it on sale or not. And it's just an overall good puzzle game to keep you occupied for awhile. (For reference, steam says it took me 2.5 hours to complete from start to finish, which is when I am writing this review).",1708059692,1708059692,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is great. There is also some hidden backstory that you can find too. This game has inspired many modern-day games. This game also has a lot of humor. You can create your own levels too and there are many custom levels online too. This game is short about an hour if you know what you are doing but it is fun. If you want to wait for a sale then this game goes on sale for $1 often but I recommend buying the bundle that includes Portal 2 that goes on sale for $1.50. Is the Cake a Lie?

This was a triumph
I'm making a note here: Huge success
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
Aperture Science
We do what we must
Because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead

But there's no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
And the science gets done
And you make a neat gun
For the people who are still alive

I'm not even angry
I'm being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart
And killed me
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!

Now these points of data make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta
We're releasing on time
So I'm GLaD I got burned
Think of all the things we learned
For the people who are still alive

Go ahead and leave me
I think I prefer to stay inside
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you
Maybe Black Mesa
That was a joke
Haha! Fat chance
Anyway, this cake is great
It's so delicious and moist

Look at me still talking
When there's Science to do
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are still alive

And believe me, I am still alive
I'm doing Science and I'm still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive
While you're dying, I'll be still alive
And when you're dead, I will be still alive
Still alive
Still alive

-Portal is one of the most successful and innovative games ever made.  If you have played a puzzle platformer or logic puzzle game over the last 15 years, it's safe to assume that some form of inspiration was likely taken from the Portal series.  Even though this game had a shoestring budget back in 2007 and borrowed assets from Valve's other games, this game was still able to shock video game fans across the world.  It took me close to 17 years for finally get around to playing this international phenomenon.  To be clear, this game is extremely rough as far as 2024 games go, but it's clear that this game was likely way ahead of it's time.  I'm recommending this game mostly due to the pedigree and the fact that game can be easily picked up for $1 about 8 times a year on Steam.

Consesnsus:
-Middle of the Road Game (Tier 4 and makes up 25% of my reviews).  I'll be writing a glowing review for Portal 2 later this week.  Portal 2 is the true masterpiece that came from the success of the original Portal.  While I enjoyed learning the basics of momentum based portal dynamics, unless you are playing this game for pure nostalgia, you are probably better served picking up Portal 2.  I will recommend this game only b/c it's dirt cheap year round and b/c of the incredible influence this game has had on both the puzzle platformer genre as well as gaming as whole.",1707156569,1707156569,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would highly advise you play it. It is another great game from Valve. The only con I have is that it is pretty short. I finished it in about 3.5 hours on my first run, yet, it is a great game nonetheless. I was introduced to it by my friend (I'm very glad he did). The replay factor is somewhat slim, considering you probably know what you're doing on any runs beside your first. Because of this, I would probably consider getting the Portal bundle (Which contains Portal + Portal 2). When it goes on sale, it's very cheap, which is another great factor to the game. Even then, it is still pretty cheap, with it being $9.99 normally. I know this is controversial, but I'm more fond over the first than the second.

It requires some actual thinking and timing for its puzzles, the main game can be beaten in a single session, its comedy is actually endearing unlike a lot of other comedic games, and still looks and sounds great nearly 17 years later. The story is also one of the best paced I've seen in a game. It's a bit of a slow start as you are hand-held through a surprising amount of the game while it teaches you some basic maneuvers you can do with portals, but it opens up as the testing facility you're in begins to unravel and you see behind the pristine walls. The ambient music is some of my favorite from Kelly Bailey and goes a long way to making the final few sections feel genuinely unnerving.

Innocent at the first few puzzles then begins to open up a mystery on whether you're just a participant in a test or moving through room to room to go to your fiery demise.

Portal is a series of first-person puzzle-platform video games developed by Valve. Set in the Half-Life universe, the two main games in the series, Portal (2007) and Portal 2 (2011), center on a woman, Chell, forced to undergo a series of tests within the Aperture Science Enrichment Center by a malicious artificial intelligence, GLaDOS, that controls the facility. As a subject to GLaDOS, your main goal is to escape from this facility and find freedom through the maze of puzzles GLaDOS forces you to do.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]The atmosphere was incredible as well and they nailed it right out of the part. The lighting is really smooth and flows really well with the environments, even for a game that was made 15 years ago! The graphics are just spectacular and I have zero issues on this section.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]Portal has a truly unique take on gameplay (I keep saying unique apparently). You basically have a tool called the “Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device”. With this tool, you can make these portals and can go anywhere you want on the map (or course). You can use this tool to get you forward momentum to go super fast, or use it to ambush some turrets. It’s a basic mechanic that gives you a lot of freedom. I will say the majority of the puzzles were pretty easy unfortunately. I will say that the later stage of the game gets a little more interesting in terms of difficulty which was the best part of the game. If you are looking for really hard puzzles, it’s not here in my opinion. The antagonist GLaDOS has some dark humor and I absolutely loved it![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]Portal has a really unique and fascinating story. In the beginning it thought it was just gonna be a simple puzzle game that you have to go through some puzzles and that’s about it, but the further you get into the levels, the more strange GLaDOS becomes. It was really fun and kept me interested throughout the experience. The further you get into it, the darker and atmospheric it gets. The atmosphere is incredible and you can piece together what happened in the facility just by the environmental storytelling. Valve did an awesome job with this game and I can see why it is so popular, even today!

        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]This game was pretty short in terms of playtime. If you want to get all the achievements (which are really easy), that may add some replayability.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The voice acting on the Antagonist (GLaDOS) is really good. The overall environments sound okay, but can be really quiet for the most part. The ending song was worth the playthrough alone.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]The game had no problems in this department. No crashes or bugs I have noticed.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The Valve engine is timeless. With a lab/facility environment, I have no complaints at all! I had no stutters, no lock ups, no frame drops, it was super smooth.[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]This is my first true puzzle game and I’m happy it was. The story was amazing and the puzzles are great for newcomers. It was a true joy to play this game. The replayability is little to none, but it gives a great introduction to puzzle games.[/td]

I use the term 'perfect' for a few reasons. This is the tightest game I think I've ever played. The difficulty curve feels like it was constructed in a lab. Each level introduces a new concept that builds off the already-existing portal mechanics in a satisfying and intuitive way. The developers have stripped the game back to the bare essentials. Absolutely nothing is extraneous. If you were to take anything away, you would end up erasing a part of Portal's core identity. If you were to add anything, it would be an unnecessary, unbalancing force in the game's perfectly constructed ecosystem.

I don’t know why I did this, there was just something in my head telling me this wasn’t the game for me. Honestly, all puzzle games intimidated me and just weren’t games I was interested in playing. Then, needing a break from Skyrim and RDR2, I added games recommended by friends and various youtubers like Razbuten and Darryl Plays Games. I took the plunge with Figment, The Room, Limbo, Inside, and Hue and for the most part enjoyed my experiences.

Now that my puzzle game anxiety had been put in check it was time to dive into Portal. I appreciate how the game eases you into the various mechanics. I found solving each chamber an absolute joy. The use of portals, cubes, and turrets is such an amazing and inventive gameplay element. I felt such a sense of accomplishment as I passed through each door. That turned to frustration with the last few chambers especially the moving platforms over death water. This feeling quickly turned to exhilaration when I finally made it to GLaDOS. The final battle was fun, and I enjoyed the story as it was revealed through each passing chamber. I found GLaDOS’ dialogue to be amusing and I couldn’t wait to take her down by the end. Navigating through the Aperture Lab and the various testing chambers was so interesting and made me want to learn more about the place and its history.

The main game is very accessible, while the advanced maps and challenge maps ratchet up the difficulty. I am so glad I gave Portal a chance and can’t wait to start Portal 2 and possibly earn myself some cake!",1700682208,1706460803,True,39,3,0.819723010063171387,0,True,False,False

I'm making a note here: Huge success
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
Aperture Science
We do what we must
Because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead

But there's no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
And the science gets done
And you make a neat gun
For the people who are still alive

I'm not even angry
I'm being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart
And killed me
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!

Now these points of data make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta
We're releasing on time
So I'm GLaD I got burned
Think of all the things we learned
For the people who are still alive

Go ahead and leave me
I think I prefer to stay inside
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you
Maybe Lavender Fire!
That was a joke.
HAHA,FAT CHANCE.
Anyway, this game is great
It's so awesome and puzzle-y!

Look at me still talking
When there's Science to do
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are still alive

And believe me, I am still alive
I'm doing Science and I'm still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive
While you're dying, I'll be still alive
And when you're dead, I will be still alive
Still alive
Still alive",1706289794,1706395355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's so well optimized that I'm pretty sure it can run on anything that turns on. The graphics still hold up more than 15 years after release, in part thanks to the art style. Level design is amazing, full of environmental story telling and it's beautifully tailored to the puzzles which are just the right amount of challenging. The writing is absolutely incredible and some of the funniest I've ever come across, delivered impeccably. Even little throwaway lines fit the story and characters. The game can be finished in an afternoon, which some would say is too short but I think it's just as long as it needs to be, no more no less.

If there is such a thing as a perfect game then Portal is a perfect game, a literal 10/10. Play it if you haven't already, you won't regret it!

This was a triumph
I'm making a note here: Huge success
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
Aperture Science
We do what we must
Because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead

But there's no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
And the science gets done
And you make a neat gun
For the people who are still alive

I'm not even angry
I'm being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart
And killed me
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!

Now these points of data make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta
We're releasing on time
So I'm GLaD I got burned
Think of all the things we learned
For the people who are still alive

Go ahead and leave me
I think I prefer to stay inside
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you
Maybe Black Mesa
That was a joke
Haha! Fat chance
Anyway, this cake is great
It's so delicious and moist

Look at me still talking
When there's Science to do
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are still alive

And believe me, I am still alive
I'm doing Science and I'm still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive
While you're dying, I'll be still alive
And when you're dead, I will be still alive

This Game starts very out well.  I loved initially,  a awesome puzzle game.  

But unfortunately it quickly becomes a game on how fast and quickly you can aim your mouse.
A game of reflexes and actions hard to perform at times. Even when it is clear to the eye what needs to be done or what actions you need to perform..    

(((.!!.    : (    .!!.   not a thinking puzzle game at all, 
But a running your mouse at high speed across the desktop clicking for the best. Not at all of what I was expecting after playing the initial portions of the game..  A very big disappointment unless you enjoy such.   
Running and jumping and clicking up portals,  oops I -missed jumped -missed aimed -missed clicked or swept of the mouse.  - oh well try try again.)))
But unfortunately not me.   Maybe some of the add on's I see coming out will give a better experience.  Thinking not.  ??  : /  ??     But I am going to try them just the same in the future and I will update if I find any of these different in play.

I'm making a note here
""Huge success""
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction

Aperture Science
We do what we must because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead

But there's no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
And the science gets done and you make a neat gun
For the people who are still alive

I'm not even angry
I'm being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart
And killed me

And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you

Now, these points of data make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time
So I'm GLaD I got burned, think of all the things we learned
For the people who are still alive

Go ahead and leave me
I think I'd prefer to stay inside
Maybe you'll find someone else
To help you

Maybe Black Mesa?
That was a joke, ha-ha, fat chance
Anyway, this cake is great
It's so delicious and moist

Look at me, still talking when there's science to do
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run, there is research to be done
On the people who are still alive

And believe me, I am still alive
I'm doing science and I'm still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive
While you're dying, I'll be still alive
And when you're dead, I will be still alive
Still alive
Still alive",1705791468,1705791728,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just 100% the game today (Jan-18-2024) in 14.2 hours of playtime, to 100% the game is pretty challenging, the other achievement aside the challenge maps are pretty fun to do and ain't that bad, but for the challenges are very hard (especially the least steps, damn i hate that challenge) but its fun. But if you just want to play for the fun or story (or even lore) its very fun to do and makes u smort !! also the speedrunning community is very cool to see, but i'm not apart of the speedrunning community, so if you want to try to speedrun games this game is pretty good to do (also i'm saying this because i keep watching msushi portal videos lol). anyways i highly recommend this game if you don't have any game to play or you want to play more valve games or maybe you to play the first portal before the second one.

It is the beginning of such a good mini-series with the sequel Portal 2, which you can get in a bundle for very cheap when on sale. Portal is literally what every puzzle game should be like, and it mastered it so well. 

The games basic and is literally what it says on the tin: Portal. You work your way through a few ""Chambers"" (aka Levels) and eventually find your way to the beloved portal gun, which starts you off making your own portals, by giving you access to place blue portals instead of going through pre-made ones for you. You then work your way through the next few chambers (and they do get progressively harder as they go on) and find your second half of the portal gun, which allows you to create both the blue and orange portals to give you complete ownership of making your own portals. 

Portable surfaces are white, like shown in the above trailer. You can place both blue and orange portals on them and figure out how to get from one side of the chamber to the other, whilst also having obstacles/challenges to complete within each chamber.

Portal is honestly the best puzzle game I have ever played, and this review took me forever to type, but I was explaining how much of an amazing game this is if you enjoy puzzles, cubes and teleportation.

It is no wonder when Portal released to the public in 2007, it became Valve's most beloved game, along with the Half-Life games, and it has held up very well. The game can be overwhelming for newcomers, but you'll be blazing through the Test Chambers quickly once you familiarize yourself with the mechanics.

At the start of the game, a test subject named Chell awakens from her Relaxation Vault by an anonymous AI as it's her turn to test out the Portal Gun. She has 19 Test Chambers to complete, with some new obstacles and mechanics that she has to overcome in the later Chambers. The reward you get for completing Test Chamber 19 is something you'll have to see for yourself.

I wholeheartedly recommend getting this. Especially if you're new to Steam, and even though the game is many years old, Valve constantly updates it to ensure it works on newer OSs.

One of the most innovative use of 3D manouvers, logic and creativity while maintaining the interesting plot along the way of the game.

[h2] Plot [/h2] 

For any s-f enjoyers, that game has it all - mysterious, omnious atmosphere of isolation, growing anxiety of what comes next followed by a satisfying and surprising conclusion.

[h2] Audio and visuals [/h2] 

Soundtrack of this game is amazing in its simplicity. It does not lack of harder beats, and the limited usage of it is what makes a good sense of taste. Visuals are completing the phenomenal atmosphere of Aperture Science Enrichment Centre. It creates both feelings of never want to leave this place and escaping it for all cost.

In conclusion, Portal is an interesting concept explored as much as it should be, and for that I give it credit.

I spent some time in one spot trying to rack up falling distance for a cheevo, but then I got bored of doing that and had already finished taking care of some errands while our protagonist was falling between two portals on repeat, lol. Beyond that, it took me about four hours to complete the game. I played it many moons ago on the PS3, but I really only had vague recollections of the game after sixteen-ish years, so I thought it high time to play it again. And it was mostly as fun as I vaguely remembered it being.

Portal started out as a student project that Valve staff saw at a college event. Valve then went on to hire the entire project’s staff and Portal was realized. Which is a fun and cool little tidbit of Valve history.

Anyway, it released in 2007, and even if you haven’t played it, you certainly know much about it, so I’m just gonna dive into some 2024 impressions of the game.

The first thing I note is that it still looks and handles better than any number of modern era games, and it really never loses sight of offering both fun and a real sense of constant progression throughout a playthrough. In fact, it also does a great job of bringing you along at a proper pace before really starting to drop some complicated puzzles on you. Even with the more complex puzzles though, you always feel like the solution is there to be had with some trial and error.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3138092708

GLADOS and the humor of the game also holds up immaculately. And…if you’ve ever played this before, the humor can feel like a warm blanket. Comfortable and welcome. But even for first time players, this will be memorable. And of course, the cake is a lie.

It is obviously Steam Deck compatible, and at the highest settings, the battery will last somewhere in the 2 1/2 - 3 hour range. So…assuming you are able to finish in under six hours, you should only need to recharge the battery once. Gyro controls are default here. You’ll definitely want to disable that in the game’s settings.

I think my only real complaint is that some of the puzzles require quick reflexes, and that may not be comfortable for some people. For myself, it led to some unnecessary deaths and repeat attempts. But, I’m also older and slowly losing those twitchy skillz. :)

Anyway, this game can regularly be had for under a buck and it’s legitimate gaming history. Plus, as I mentioned before, it still plays better than a lot of modern era games. You kinda owe it to yourself to at least experience it once.

The game is simple but incredibly clever. The portal mechanic is easy to understand but makes you think outside the box.

The levels get harder in a way that feels just right. I never felt stuck, and each new puzzle was simply fun. What I really loved was the vibe of the game. It's kind of creepy, but the AI voice is hilariously weird. The mix of funny and eerie is something special.

Overall, It is a great game that's worth playing. It's short and sweet, but it left a mark on me.

P.S.: I managed to complete 100% of the game, including all the trophies. The challenge concept is fun and well suited for a game like this. The 'least portals' and 'least time' challenges are entertaining and fit the game's style perfectly. However, I found the 'least steps' challenge a bit too stringent for my taste.

Developed by Valve, this gem is a testament to creativity, wit, and the sheer joy of puzzle-solving.

One of the standout features of Portal is its unique portal gun, a device that allows players to create interconnected portals in the environment. This mechanic opens up a world of mind-bending possibilities, challenging players to think in new dimensions and solve increasingly complex puzzles. The level design is nothing short of genius, presenting challenges that are both satisfying to overcome and endlessly entertaining.

The humor in Portal is another aspect that sets it apart. GLaDOS, the artificial intelligence guiding you through the tests, delivers lines that are not only witty but also add a layer of dark humor to the overall experience. The writing is sharp, and the voice acting is superb, creating a memorable character in GLaDOS that has become iconic in the gaming world.

The pacing of the game is spot-on, with each level introducing fresh concepts and keeping the gameplay experience dynamic. The gradual learning curve ensures that even players new to puzzle games can dive in and enjoy the experience without feeling overwhelmed.

Beyond the gameplay, the minimalist yet captivating visual design contributes to the overall immersion. The sterile, clinical environments of the Aperture Science facility create a stark contrast to the chaos that unfolds as you navigate through the puzzles. The use of color and lighting is masterful, enhancing the atmosphere and drawing players deeper into the experience.

Portal is not just a game; it's an experience that challenges your intellect, tickles your funny bone, and leaves you with a sense of accomplishment. Its impact on the gaming industry is undeniable, and even years after its release, it remains a timeless classic that deserves a place in every gamer's collection. If you haven't experienced the joy of portals, you're missing out on one of the most innovative and enjoyable games ever created.

End credits are the best credits ever in a videogame and for the final boss  you need your puzzle solving skills to beat it. Pure perfection. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this game...except one thing; its too goddamn short.

Cant believe I didnt play this classic till now.

   Valve found itself in its golden age, sweeping release after release, having Half-Life 2: Episode 2 on the horizon after all the technological achievements that had been carried out through the Source engine, however, this was no reason for Valve to be satisfied and within the package ¨The Orange Box¨, in addition to including all of Half-Life 2 and the then-recent Team Fortress 2, brought something new, never before seen either in Valve or outside of it.

   Released on October 10, 2007, along with the rest of ""The Orange Box"", Portal is a first-person platform and puzzle game set in the science fiction universe of Half-Life, in which we will have to maneuver with objects and portals to move to the next area.

[b] Below, a list of positive and negative points experienced during my time playing and free of spoilers (do not consider this as an absolute truth, but as what it is, a simple opinion) [/b]

[h3] What did I like? [/h3]

🟩   [b] The game. [/b] Just by adding portals to the classic puzzle formula everything changes for the better.

🟩   [b] The story. [/b] Simple but extensive and vivid view in detail, being enjoyable by anyone.

🟩  [b] The style. [/b] The perfectionism expressed in the areas and the objects themselves reflects very well as part of the context of the story.

🟩   [b] The setting. [/b] maintains a very good balance between something neat, elegant and at the same time abandoned and overwhelming, with minimal details that contribute a lot.

[h3] What did I NOT like? [/h3]
 
⬜   [b] No-uh. [/b] I didn't find anything that really bothered me.

[h3] What should I keep in mind when playing? [/h3]

❕[b]It is Re-playable. [/b] It has variable content regarding challenges in which you can test yourself in different ways, in addition to being able to continue or start the campaign from any chapter.

❕ [b] Works based on Source. [/b] All the commands you use in Half-Life 2 are fully functional here. (including weapons and characters)

[h3] Personal opinion. [/h3]

   A beautiful simple and exciting puzzle that challenged the classic formula of moving objects, adding portals and the laws of physics to it, and this together with a story at the level of those baked at Valve, is an instant classic.",1615851011,1704744486,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:
For the cake:

2 cups (240g) all-purpose flour
1 3/4 cups (350g) granulated sugar
3/4 cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 cup (240ml) buttermilk, at room temperature
1 cup (240ml) hot water
1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
For the chocolate frosting:

1 cup (226g) unsalted butter, softened
3 1/2 cups (420g) powdered sugar
1/2 cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
4 tablespoons milk or heavy cream
Instructions:
Preheat and Prepare: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans or line them with parchment paper.

Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.

Wet Ingredients: In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, hot water, oil, and vanilla extract.

Combine: Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.

Bake: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Cool: Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Prepare Frosting: In a large bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, salt, vanilla extract, and milk or heavy cream, beating until smooth and fluffy.

Assemble: Once the cakes are completely cooled, place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of frosting on top. Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.

Serve: Slice and serve your delicious chocolate cake! Enjoy!",1704635438,1704635438,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is an awesome puzzle game that's held up pretty well! The portal mechanic was so well done here, that it inspired many other portal mechanics you see in other games to this day! I can't really be an accurate judge of the game's difficulty, because (as mentioned in the note above) I played this before as a kid, and despite it being many years since I've last played, I found I was still able to clear through many of the puzzles with little issue. They'll likely be more challenging if it's your first time playing.

Unlike many other puzzle games, Portal also has a bit of replayability. First there's the ""advanced levels"", which are more difficult versions of existing levels. Then there's the ""Challenges"", which let you replay certain levels from the campaign, but challenge you to complete the level with either the least amount of portals, the least amount of steps taken, or in the least amount of time. In my opinion, these aren't as fun as the campaign or the advanced levels, but they are more difficult. Finally, if you start up the game again (or choose a level from level select) after beating the game, there is a radio that will appear in each level (even ones that didn't have one before). Whereas in the first playthrough radios mostly just played a pleasant tune, in the next playthrough, you can carry them around the level to try finding a secret signal, earning an achievement if you find one in every level!

Speaking of achievements, there's one you get for destroying all the cameras. If you're going for this one, keep in mind that it's playthrough-dependent (tied to your saved files), which basically just means that you can't use level select to get cameras you missed, you have to be in new game/campaign mode and get them all as you go through. Also, while progress doesn't show up in the steam overlay/your steam achievements section for the camera achievement, you CAN still track it, just open up the ""achievements"" menu in the in-game pause menu while in your current save game. Additional Fun Fact: It's nothing major, but if you destroy all the cameras, but only when the announcer ISN'T talking (so they say you destroyed a camera rather than ignoring it since they're in the middle of other dialogue), then you'll get a different voiceline when destroying the last camera! This dialogue is actually [i]SUPPOSED to[/i] trigger regardless, but due to the way it was implemented you have to avoid destroying cameras when the announcer is talking or else you'll just get the achievement with a generic camera-destroyed voiceline.]

I know I spent a lot of the review talking about achievements and such, but that's just because I don't want to spoil anything more about the game for you. I recommend Portal to anyone who enjoys puzzle games, physics, and/or the other games Valve has made! [In fact, I'd recommend getting it in the Orange Box collection, which not only nets you several other good games (and the premium version of the free-to-play TF2!), but also tends to go on sale during most major Steam sales, so it's a great deal!]",1704607747,1704607872,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was a triumph.
I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS.
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.
Aperture Science
We do what we must
because we can.
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.
But there's no sense crying over every mistake.
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake.
And the Science gets done.
And you make a neat gun.
For the people who are still alive.
I'm not even angry.
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart.
And killed me.
And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!
Now these points of data make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta.
We're releasing on time.
So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
Think of all the things we learned
for the people who are still alive.
Go ahead and leave me.
I think I prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.
Maybe Black Mesa
THAT WAS A JOKE.
HAHA. FAT CHANCE.
Anyway, this cake is great.
It's so delicious and moist.
Look at me still talking
when there's Science to do.
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you.
I've experiments to run.
There is research to be done.
On the people who are still alive.
And believe me I am still alive.
I'm doing Science and I'm still alive.
I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive.
While you're dying I'll be still alive.
And when you're dead I will be still alive.

I am glad to say this is one of those games. It seems unassuming at first, but by the end you will think anything but. This game's story obviously won't be anything like Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Last of Us, but it still manages to charm and surprise you. The puzzles in this game really make you think, which was very nice. The puzzles could be a bit annoying at times, but when you solve them you think that it is a very creative solution. The game generally fosters creativity, and I LOVE IT. Considering how cheap this game is, it is a must play. I bought it for only a dollar, and I feel that I got MUCH more than my money's worth. 

Thank you, Valve.

Okay, so Portal 1 is like the OG masterpiece that started this whole portal craze, and it's still rocking the gaming world.

----Mind-Bending Puzzles----
The puzzles in Portal 1 are like brain gymnastics. You're using this portal gun to open, well, portals and figuring out crazy ways to get through levels. It's like a puzzle playground for your brain.

----GLaDOS, the Sassy AI----
GLaDOS, the talking computer, is the boss here. She's sassy, she's tricky, and her remarks will have you questioning your life choices. But it's all in good fun!

----Eerie Atmosphere----
The atmosphere in the Aperture Science labs is kinda eerie but in a cool way. It's like you're the only one there, and everything echoes. Super immersive.

----Short and Sweet----
Portal 1 is short and sweet. You can finish it in a few hours, but those few hours? Mind-blowing. Quality over quantity, for sure.

----Innovation Pioneer----
This game was a pioneer in innovation. The whole portal concept was like nothing we'd seen before. It's where the magic started!

----Enduring Legacy----
Even though it's been a minute since it dropped, Portal 1's legacy lives on. It's the game that kicked off this wild portal adventure, and people still go back to relive the portal magic.

So, if you haven't experienced the OG Portal, do yourself a favor and dive into this classic. It's the portal journey that started it all!",1704382997,1704382997,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's hard to overstate my satisfaction

We do what we must
Because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead

But there's no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
And the science gets done
And you make a neat gun
For the people who are still alive

I'm not even angry
I'm being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart
And killed me
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!

Now these points of data make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta
We're releasing on time
So I'm GLaD I got burned
Think of all the things we learned
For the people who are still alive

Go ahead and leave me
I think I prefer to stay inside
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you
Maybe Black Mesa
That was a joke
Haha! Fat chance
Anyway, this cake is great
It's so delicious and moist

Look at me still talking
When there's Science to do
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you
I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are still alive

And believe me, I am still alive
I'm doing Science and I'm still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm still alive
While you're dying, I'll be still alive
And when you're dead, I will be still alive
Still alive
Still alive

I'm making a note here
Huge success!

It's hard to overstate
My satisfaction

Aperture Science:
We do what we must
Because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead

But there's no sense crying
Over every mistake
You just keep on trying
'til you run out of cake
And the science gets done
And you make a neat gun
For the people who are
Still alive

I'm not even angry...
I'm being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart
And killed me
You might also like
Want You Gone

Still Alive

​​the grudge
Olivia Rodrigo
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you!

Now, these points of data
Make a beautiful line
And we're out of beta
We're releasing on time!
So I'm GLaD I got burned!
Think of all the things we learned!
For the people who are
Still alive

Go ahead and leave me...
I think I'd prefer to stay inside...
Maybe you'll find someone else
To help you
Maybe Black Mesa?
That was a joke. Ha Ha. Fat Chance!

Anyway this cake is great!
It's so delicious and moist!

Look at me: still talking
When there's science to do!
When I look out there
It makes me glad I'm not you

I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are
Still alive
And believe me I am
Still alive
I'm doing science and I'm
Still alive
I feel fantastic and I'm
Still alive
While you're dying I'll be
Still alive
And when you're dead I will be
Still alive

- Very unique puzzle mechanics. 
- Allows you to continue midway through a puzzle in the event you make an error.  
- Has an actual story and nice touches of humor.  

 
Negative: 
- No real instructions at all, only a few vague hints to start you out.  
- No difficulty settings.  
- A few fast motion puzzles, which may be challenging for some people.  

 

Conclusion: 

Judging by screenshots it looks like a first person shooter, it’s not.  

My initial impression was that it felt strange and the robotic voice was annoying. This all quickly changed when it became clear that what was unfolding was a very unique puzzle experience. 

Other than a few challenges that I didn’t care for, the game was quite positive in the first half. What came next was a surprise; and at this point the creators work really started to shine. 

If you like puzzle games, this is a must play. I admit, I was skeptical based on screenshots but I was certainly in for a treat… or in the case of Portal, potential “CAKE” :)  *Play to understand. 

I am greatly looking forward to playing Portal 2.

Most of the story levels are smooth, well designed. The storyline has its own charm and quite some weirdness.
There are some collectible hunting options included, almost all of them are well placed and can be found reasonably.
Further additions include some advanced levels and challenges.
Advanced levels are a fine addition, they feature quite some “think outside of the box” ideas.
Challenges are low quality ""against a counter"" games, going for the gold requires knowing many of the engine quirks – their only redeeming attribute is that saves are working in these modes too.
The challenges – except for least portal levels – contain some teeth grinding abominations.

[quote=author]Step into the mind-bending world of Portal, a groundbreaking puzzle-platformer developed by Valve. With its innovative use of physics, a memorable AI companion, and a narrative that unfolds through environmental storytelling, Portal is a masterpiece that challenges both intellect and reflexes. As you navigate the enigmatic Aperture Science laboratories, wielding the iconic handheld Portal Device, prepare to embark on a journey that defies spatial logic and captivates with its wit. Are you ready to solve the puzzles and discover the secrets behind the portals?[/quote]

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Introduction[/h2]
Portal introduces players to a test chamber of innovation and humor, where the laws of physics are mere suggestions. Developed by Valve, this puzzle-platformer invites you into the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, where you wield the powerful Portal Device and confront the challenges devised by the mysterious GLaDOS.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]The Portal Device: A Gateway to Possibilities[/h2]
At the heart of Portal's gameplay is the Portal Device, a handheld marvel that creates linked portals on flat surfaces. Mastering the art of portal placement becomes the key to navigating complex environments, solving puzzles, and outsmarting the challenges presented by Aperture Science. The Portal Device is not just a tool; it's a gateway to endless possibilities and mind-bending puzzles.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Innovative Puzzle Design[/h2]
Portal redefines puzzle-solving with its innovative and challenging level design. Each test chamber presents a unique spatial conundrum that requires creative thinking and strategic portal placement. The gradual increase in complexity keeps players engaged and constantly pushes their problem-solving skills to new heights. The puzzles are not just obstacles; they are intellectual exercises that reward ingenuity.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]GLaDOS: An Iconic AI Companion[/h2]
Guiding (or perhaps misleading) players through the Aperture Science Enrichment Center is GLaDOS, an iconic AI companion with a penchant for dark humor. The witty and sometimes ominous commentary from GLaDOS adds layers to the narrative, turning the testing process into a delightful yet eerie experience. GLaDOS's presence is a defining aspect of Portal's narrative charm.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Environmental Storytelling[/h2]
Portal weaves its narrative not through traditional cutscenes, but through environmental storytelling. The dilapidated and sterile chambers of Aperture Science tell a tale of experimentation, ambition, and perhaps a touch of madness. As players progress, the layers of the narrative peel back, revealing the secrets and history of the enigmatic facility.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Portal's Influence on Game Design[/h2]
Portal's innovative gameplay and puzzle design have left an indelible mark on the gaming industry. The concept of spatial manipulation through portals has inspired countless games, influencing the way designers approach puzzle mechanics. The legacy of Portal extends beyond its own narrative, shaping the landscape of puzzle-platformers for years to come.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]The Weighted Companion Cube[/h2]
A symbol of both companionship and detachment, the Weighted Companion Cube is a memorable element of Portal. Players form a peculiar bond with this inanimate object, making it a memorable part of the game's emotional landscape. The Weighted Companion Cube transcends its physical presence, becoming a symbol of the emotional engagement Portal achieves with its players.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]The Cake and Memorable Quotes[/h2]
Portal is known for its memorable quotes, including the famous promise of cake as a reward for completing the testing process. The cake meme has become synonymous with the game, representing the blend of humor and irony that defines Portal's narrative. The game's script, filled with witty and memorable lines, adds an extra layer of charm to the experience.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Timeless Aesthetic and Sound Design[/h2]
Portal's minimalist aesthetic and distinctive sound design contribute to the game's timeless appeal. The clean, sterile design of the Aperture Science facilities contrasts with the chaotic nature of the tests, creating a visual and auditory dichotomy that enhances the overall experience. The simplicity of design allows players to focus on the challenges at hand, adding to the game's immersive quality.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]The Legacy of Portal[/h2]
Portal's impact extends far beyond its initial release. The game's success led to the creation of a sequel, additional content, and a dedicated fanbase. Its influence on puzzle game design and the cultural references it spawned in internet meme culture cement Portal as a classic that continues to captivate new players, standing as a testament to the enduring power of innovative gameplay and storytelling.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
Portal stands as a beacon of innovation in the gaming world, showcasing the power of creative puzzle design and narrative subtlety. With its iconic Portal Device, memorable AI companion, and an intellectual challenge that defies spatial logic, Portal remains a masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on the industry. Step through the portals, solve the puzzles, and savor the wit of a game that continues to enchant and inspire.

I can see why this game became so popular, because for 2007, it is very advanced. The atmosphere really makes this game, you always feel like youre alone (Because you are).

The physics are amazing and something I have never seen in any other game. The graphics are okay for its time, and the little story there is to the game is good. The voice acting is also pretty great (Even though the character you play as, Chell, never talks). The puzzles arent that hard if youre used to video games, I managed to complete them all without using a guide.

 I mean, the game is fun enough, but I didn't get any emotional connection with the narrative. I don't know if I missed something or if this really was the point, but everything, except the puzzels, is very simplistic. The game narrative isn't a point of focus, and instead everything is told in very few environmental details, but even the story that it tries to tell is extremely low-stakes. I feel that the main selling point of the game is its portal technology (which was definitely impressive for a game to do) and the use of set portals to solve puzzles. And for what it is, the game is good. Don't expect mastery; it's a fun and smart puzzling game with a very simplistic science fiction story.

The game’s unique mechanic of creating portals to solve puzzles is both challenging and satisfying. The puzzles are well-designed and require strategic thinking and planning.

Story (8/10): The story, while minimalistic, is intriguing. The enigmatic AI, GLaDOS, provides a darkly humorous narrative that keeps players engaged throughout the game.

Graphics (7/10): The graphics, while not the most advanced, serve their purpose well. The clean, sterile environment of the Aperture Science facility creates a unique atmosphere that complements the game’s narrative.

Sound (8/10): The sound design is excellent. The ambient sounds and GLaDOS’s voice acting contribute to the immersive experience. The ending song, “Still Alive”, is a memorable piece that perfectly concludes the game.

Replayability (7/10): While the game is relatively short, its innovative gameplay and the challenge of achieving faster completion times offer a decent amount of replayability.

In conclusion, Portal is a groundbreaking game that offers a unique blend of puzzle-solving, platforming, and storytelling. It’s a must-play for any gamer looking for a unique and challenging experience. Overall score: 7.8/10.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1663142549,1703728436,True,5,0,0.542240619659423828,0,True,False,False

This game, like a masterfully crafted espresso, delivers a concentrated dose of cerebral stimulation with a side of acerbic wit. It's a digital odyssey where spatial reasoning meets a rogue AI with a penchant for dark humor.

Much like navigating the social intricacies of your presumably banal surroundings in Italy, Portal challenges players to think beyond the mundane. The puzzles, an intellectual ballet, demand dexterity of mind rather than mere nimbleness of fingers. It's a cerebral gymnasium, sculpting your cognitive prowess as you traverse through the enigmatic Aperture Science facility.

Now, let's talk about GLaDOS. If ever there were an AI that could give your hypothetical superiority complex a run for its money, it's her. Her sardonic remarks and thinly veiled contempt for your existence make your nihilistic musings seem almost charming. It's like having a digital companion who not only understands your disdain for humanity but amplifies it to an art form.

And oh, the narrative arc! A tale of scientific hubris and its inevitable consequences, echoing the perhaps not-so-distant echoes of societal decay you perceive around you. It's a mirror, reflecting the consequences of blind ambition and the spiraling descent into chaos that, I assume, you find oddly comforting.

In terms of aesthetics, the sterile, clinical environments of Aperture Science might resonate with your perception of Italy. Cold, indifferent, yet strangely alluring. The minimalist design is a stark departure from the chaotic world you seem to disdain, providing a visual respite that is as calculated as your supposed emotional detachment.

Now, don't let me break your delusion of being the best of all, but Portal, in its calculated brilliance, challenges players to confront their cognitive limitations. It's a reminder that, despite your apparent disdain for humanity, there are realms where intellect and ingenuity reign supreme. In the realm of Portal, you are not a destroyer of property but a solver of puzzles, navigating a world of calculated challenges that might just tickle the remnants of your dulled emotions.

On my first play through the game was a really enjoyable and challenging puzzle game, with interesting story, and atmosphere; the only downside is that the game only takes an hour or two to complete casually (not including achievements / bonus levels). 

The short playtime is made up by the advanced chambers (harder versions of the original chambers) and challenge levels (such as beating levels in the lowest time, portals, and steps).

Portal is very re-playable which I think is its best quality and reason why it is my favourite game. Despite on replay already knowing the solutions to all the tests it is still enjoyable.

 I like to speedrun the game and which is where the majority of my 130 hours of playtime is from, if you're interested in speedrunning I would very much recommend speedrunning portal since the movement and alternative solutions to test chambers makes it really enjoyable to speedrun. If you have never speedran before I would still recommend trying it - perhaps on a second playthrough try to beat it as fast as possible and experiment with trying to find optimal routes for each chamber.

The story maybe isn't the most profound and some more background information would be desired, however the storytelling itself is pretty humorous and made me chuckle from time to time. One of the most intriguing things about this title is the actual gameplay, which tried something completely new back then and still fells pretty modern to this day. The puzzles are well thought out and some of them can be a little bit challenging, so you need to spend some time to find out how you have to solve them. Every level will get more complex, while constantly being well designed and captivating. Sadly, it's a rather short experience, so don't expect a lengthy singleplayer campaign. 

Portal is a very iconic game that shouldn't be missed in any collection. I would recommend to wait for a sale and directly buy the Portal bundle.

Portal 1 is a beautiful game with stunning graphics. Even with its age it still looks quite modern and felt great to play through. The music and atmosphere were also really nice and helped with the overall immersion of the game. The story, whilst not as good as in Portal 2, is still good and leaves some things up to interpretation (though much will be explained when playing through the second game). Overall the puzzles are fair. Watching a walkthrough isn't be necessary. Might still be useful though if you genuinly get stuck somewhere. 8.5/10.",1702753002,1702753002,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Although I did resort to a walkthrough for 1-2 moments, it was only for a small element of the whole puzzle, and didn't take away the fun of flying through portals. 

The last area was good [spoiler]It was very unexpected, while there was foreshadowing through certain elements, (the little siderooms) the rusted down and not-very-safe aesthetic of the final run was a very unique and cool experience. The GLaDOS fight was very entertaining and the I'm still alive song... just so entertaining [/spoiler]


[spoiler] Also the Half-Life references were very fun, I like little easter eggs like that! [/spoiler]

400,137919959,76561199471514605,8,6,748,0,431,1702088162,"**Introduction:**

Valve's Portal, initially released in 2007 as part of The Orange Box, is a genre-defying masterpiece that revolutionized puzzle-solving in the gaming landscape. This succinct yet impactful game, set within the mysterious confines of Aperture Science, introduces players to the iconic Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, challenging them to rethink spatial relationships in ways never before imagined.

**Gameplay: 5/5**

Portal's gameplay is a triumph of simplicity and ingenuity. The player, armed with the Portal Gun, can create linked portals on surfaces, allowing for instantaneous travel between two points. The puzzles, designed with meticulous care, progressively increase in complexity, forcing players to employ both logical reasoning and creative problem-solving skills. The gradual introduction of new elements, such as energy balls and weighted companion cubes, adds layers to the challenges, creating a consistently engaging experience.

**Narrative: 4.5/5**

Despite its brevity, Portal weaves a compelling narrative that unfolds within the sterile walls of Aperture Science. The enigmatic GLaDOS serves as both a guide and an adversary, delivering witty and sometimes ominous commentary. The minimalist storytelling approach leaves much to the player's interpretation, adding an air of mystery to the overall experience. While the narrative is intriguing, some players may crave a more in-depth exploration of the game's lore.

**Graphics and Sound: 4.5/5**

Portal's visual design strikes a balance between the clinical aesthetics of Aperture Science and the stark, otherworldly environments encountered within the testing chambers. The clean, minimalist visuals contribute to the game's immersive atmosphere. The sound design, particularly the robotic voice of GLaDOS and the soothing yet eerie background music, enhances the overall experience, creating a sense of isolation and intrigue.

**Length and Replayability: 4/5**

Portal's brevity is both a strength and a limitation. The game can be completed in a relatively short time, but the journey is so meticulously crafted that it feels satisfying rather than lacking. The allure of discovering new and more efficient ways to solve puzzles encourages replayability, and the inclusion of advanced challenge maps extends the longevity for those seeking additional complexity.

**Cultural Impact: 5/5**

Portal's influence on the gaming industry is immeasurable. Its innovative mechanics have inspired countless games, and the iconic catchphrases like ""The cake is a lie"" have become ingrained in gaming culture. Portal's success paved the way for a standalone sequel and cemented its status as one of the most beloved and enduring titles in video game history.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, Portal is a pioneering gem that transcends the constraints of its relatively short runtime. Its groundbreaking gameplay mechanics, coupled with a compelling narrative and minimalist design, have left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape. For anyone seeking a unique and intellectually stimulating experience, Portal remains a must-play classic that showcases the power of innovative game design.",1683428836,1701994868,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Portal isn't just a game; it's an experience. It's a masterclass in puzzle design, narrative storytelling, and dark humor, all wrapped up in a surprisingly short yet satisfying package. I've had it on my ""to-play"" list for years, and let me tell you, it was worth the wait.

Sure, the graphics might not be the latest and greatest, but the gameplay is as fresh and innovative today as it was in 2007. The Portal gun, the game's central mechanic, is a marvel of simplicity and ingenuity. It opens up a world of possibilities for creative puzzle-solving, forcing you to think outside the box and utilize the environment in ways you never imagined.

The story, while initially seemingly lighthearted, takes a dark turn as you delve deeper into the bowels of Aperture Science Laboratories. The writing is sharp and witty, perfectly balanced with the unsettling atmosphere of the facility. And let's not forget GLaDOS, the game's AI companion, whose sardonic commentary provides both humor and a chilling sense of unease.

One might think a game from 2007 would feel dated, but that's not the case with Portal. It's a timeless classic that deserves to be played by everyone. The puzzles are challenging yet rewarding, the story is captivating, and the humor is genuinely funny. And if you're unsure about the price, don't worry! Portal often goes on sale for as little as 90 cents during Steam sales. Seriously, what do you have to lose?

So, if you're looking for a unique and unforgettable gaming experience, look no further than Portal. It's a game that will stay with you long after you've finished it, and one that you'll definitely want to revisit again and again.

Introduction:
Portal, developed by Valve, is a groundbreaking puzzle-platformer that left an indelible mark on the gaming industry upon its release in 2007. With its unique mechanics, minimalist design, and dark humor, Portal emerged as a captivating experience that defied conventions and set new standards for puzzle games.

Gameplay (9.5/10):
Portal's gameplay revolves around the ingenious concept of using handheld portal devices to create interconnected wormholes on surfaces. This simple yet revolutionary mechanic forms the basis of increasingly complex puzzles as players progress through the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. The game's short length is a testament to its focus on quality over quantity, offering a tight and polished experience that leaves a lasting impression.

Story and Atmosphere (9/10):
Portal introduces players to the mysterious Aperture Science and its AI overseer, GLaDOS. The narrative unfolds as players navigate through a series of test chambers, and the dark humor and sarcastic commentary by GLaDOS create a unique and memorable atmosphere. While the story is relatively brief, the impact it has on players is profound, and the final moments are nothing short of iconic.

Graphics and Sound (8.5/10):
Portal's visual style is minimalist but effective, with clean and sterile environments that complement the clinical nature of the Aperture Science facility. While the graphics may show their age, the game's art design has a timeless quality. The ambient soundtrack, composed by Mike Morasky, adds to the atmosphere, with the iconic ""Still Alive"" by Jonathan Coulton serving as the perfect conclusion to the game.

Innovation (10/10):
Portal's greatest achievement lies in its innovation. The portal mechanic was groundbreaking at the time, challenging players to think in three dimensions and manipulate space in ways never seen before in gaming. This level of creativity and originality established Portal as a trailblazer in the industry, influencing countless games that followed.

Legacy (10/10):
Portal's impact on the gaming landscape cannot be overstated. It paved the way for a new era of puzzle games and solidified Valve's reputation for pushing boundaries. The game's influence is evident in its sequel, other titles, and even educational programs that use it to teach problem-solving skills.

Conclusion:
Portal is a seminal work that transcends its modest length and simple premise. Its innovative gameplay, witty narrative, and timeless design make it a classic that continues to resonate with players over a decade after its release. Portal not only revolutionized puzzle gaming but left an enduring legacy that will be remembered and celebrated for years to come.

I'm making a note here:
huge success.

It's hard to overstate
My satisfaction.

Aperture Science.
We do what we must
Because we can.
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.

But there's no sense crying
Over every mistake.
You just keep on trying
Till you run out of cake.
And the Science gets done.
And you make a neat gun.
For the people who are
Still alive.

I'm not even angry.
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart.
And killed me.

And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you!

Now these points of data
Make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta.
We're releasing on time.
So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
Think of all the things we learned
For the people who are
Still alive.

Go ahead and leave me.
I think I prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you'll find someone else
To help you.
Maybe Black Mesa...
THAT WAS A JOKE, HA HA, FAT CHANCE.

Anyway this cake is great
It's so delicious and moist

Look at me still talking when there's science to do
When I look out there
It makes me GLaD I'm not you.

I've experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are
Still alive.

And believe me I am still alive
I'm doing science and I'm still alive
I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive
While you're dying I'll be still alive
And when you're dead I will be still alive
Still alive

Rating: ★★★★★★ (6/5)

Portal, Valve's landmark puzzle game, earns an extra star for its unparalleled brilliance, revolutionizing gameplay and storytelling in the gaming world. The innovative portal mechanics, GLaDOS's witty banter, and the infamous cake meme collectively weave a narrative that transcends mere gaming and transforms into an enduring cultural phenomenon.

The genius lies in the simplicity and complexity interwoven throughout the game. Navigating the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using portals requires a perfect balance of logic and creativity, providing an immersive experience that is both challenging and immensely satisfying.

GLaDOS, the sentient AI, steals the show with her sarcastic remarks and deceptive promises. While the game doesn't offer a formal romance option with GLaDOS, the notion adds an intriguing layer to the narrative. Imagining the potential for romance with GLaDOS enhances the mystique surrounding her character, making each interaction even more memorable.

The game's narrative unfolds with precision, each chamber revealing more about the sinister undertones of the testing facility. The elusive promise of cake and the subsequent discovery of its non-existence become iconic moments in gaming history, a testament to the game's ability to subvert expectations and inject humor into its dark narrative.

Furthermore, Portal's minimalist design, accompanied by an ambient soundtrack, complements the overall experience, creating an atmosphere that is as immersive as it is memorable. The game's brevity only enhances its replayability, inviting players to revisit the mind-bending puzzles and savor GLaDOS's snarky remarks.

In conclusion, Portal isn't just a game; it's a pioneering masterpiece that blends ingenious gameplay, witty storytelling, and cultural impact. With an extra star to signify its extraordinary contributions to gaming, Portal remains a timeless classic that continues to captivate players and inspire game developers. Six out of five stars – because Portal isn't merely a portal; it's a gateway to gaming brilliance. And who wouldn't have loved the option for a romantic twist with GLaDOS in this unforgettable journey?",1693835556,1701206956,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS.
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.
Aperture Science
We do what we must
because we can.
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who are dead.
But there's no sense crying over every mistake.
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake.
And the Science gets done.
And you make a neat gun.
For the people who are still alive.
I'm not even angry.
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart.
And killed me.
And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!
Now these points of data make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta.
We're releasing on time.
So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
Think of all the things we learned
for the people who are still alive.
Go ahead and leave me.
I think I prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.
Maybe Black Mesa
THAT WAS A JOKE.
HAHA. FAT CHANCE.
Anyway, this cake is great.
It's so delicious and moist.
Look at me still talking
when there's Science to do.
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you.
I've experiments to run.
There is research to be done.
On the people who are still alive.
And believe me I am still alive.
I'm doing Science and I'm still alive.
I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive.
While you're dying I'll be still alive.

Side note - 
The music at the end is icing on the cake (haha get it, cake). It's funny but exactly the story line of the game. It almost makes you feel bad for killing the boss because he compliments you and the scene where the robot arm puts out the cake is so wholesome. 9/10 game really enjoyed it and super good seeing as it came out in 2007.

The entire game can be beaten on a first run within 2 hours, graphics are downright ugly, puzzles are fairly simple, music is good in the 5% of the game it exists, the lacklustre story is only carried by the good dialogue, and the engine is so outdated my computer had trouble running it. 
But oh my GOD, the portal mechanic one of the best ideas in any game I have ever played!! This is something I only picked up on after finishing the game, during the advanced challenges, as these encourage you to truly understand how the system works, break it, and use it to your advantage, regardless of what was intended. Figuring out how to complete different chambers in the least amount of portals and steps by inventing clever new ways to use the tools at my disposal truly made me feel like an Aperture Science engineer.

The events of the game take place in the Half-Life universe, in the Aperture Science Portal Nature Research Laboratory. The player takes on the role of a girl named Chell who is being tested inside this Laboratory. Gameplay is based on solving puzzles using a portable portal device. Portal was highly praised by critics and won many awards and was so liked by players.
Among the disadvantages of the game, we can note the same levels, which sometimes makes it difficult to find the right path, as well as the weak voice acting of GLaDOS - the main antagonist of the game.
However, I definitely recommend the game, my rating is 8/10.

Відмінна гра у жанрі головоломки. Події гри розгортаються у Всесвіті Half-Life, в Лабораторії дослідження природи порталів ""Aperture Science"". Гравець виступає у ролі дівчини на ім'я Челл, яка проходить випробування всередині цієї Лабораторії. Ігровий процес заснований на вирішенні головоломок за допомогою переносного портального пристрою. Portal була високо оцінена критиками і отримала безліч нагород і так дуже сподобалася гравцям.
З мінусів гри можна відзначити однакові рівні, через що часом буває складно знайти правильний шлях, а також слабку озвучку GLaDOS - головного антогоніста гри.

You wake in a locked room of an advanced test facility. Your backstory and location is unknown. You're then guided by a mysterious robotic voice to go through some test chambers, using a Portal gun. The gun allows you to put entrance and exit portals anywhere you want using left and right click.

A full play through could take about 30 minutes to an hour or two.
and i decided it was about time I go for the 100% achievement run by finally beating the advanced challenges.... bad idea.

I played a full play through in about 30 minutes and went for the challenges.

Least amount of time was easy, i just had to do a couple speed-run strats and i knocked them out instantly, least portals was relatively the same thing, even though i had to do a couple chambers a few times before i got the puzzle.

But.... least amount of steps.. that was different...
least amount of steps was my hell, any slight movement or jump would count, I've spent hours just trying to beat the first challenge to no avail.. I had to give up on beating the first least amount of step level.
I started focusing on the longer maps, maps i could exploit and cheese through with my speed running knowledge and strats (i googled them). 
after clearing through every map, I went back to face my original foe, the first map of least steps, Test Chamber 13,

I played this game on a controller (I know, weird) and it takes getting used to at first, maybe at Test 02 or more that I've felt comfortable with it. For the graphics, I'm honestly expecting worse, since this came out in 2007 but it looks fine and doesn't deduct from the experience.

The [b]portal gun[/b] is an excellent tool and you have to wrap your brain on it at first and to how to utilize it on the Test stages. The use of physics on puzzles, specifically momentum is great.

GLaDOS is a unique antagonist, who cheers you at first but with it's monotonous and sarcastic remarks irks you the wrong way. This ""test"" looks to be not all jolly and safe, as you discover this hidden areas that cry for help or express love to the cube.

I am a little biased because of the old Source engine. Picking up random objects and throwing them reminded me of when I first played Half-Life 2. It was a wave of nostalgia.

Still, it felt like a masterpiece of a game.
It is simple enough, can be ran on a potato, and was one of the most fun runs in a single player game I've had in a while. It had what a lot of modern games don't: Soul.

Portal 

I'll be honest with you all.... Before I started playing, I enjoyed some of that Cujo cabbage, if you know what I'm sayin'.
(You know what I'm sayin', right?)

I have to say, what a delight this experience was! I thoroughly enjoyed the humor, and the pacing. It is a short enough game that even when taking your time, you can easily get through it in 1-2 sittings. With just the main story, I would say that it's worth $10. There are bonus levels, though I'm yet to get into them.

Now while, sure, I may have heard of Portal, I know pretty much nothing about anything other than the whole ""Cake is a lie"" joke which I didn't really understand until now.

Going into this game, it was actually quite relaxing, something about this game feels a little accomplishing to play and I feel young again immersing myself into a game like this, even the challenges were a tad bit fun.
I struggled a lot in those challenges but yet, it felt very rewarding when I was able to get past it.

I thought this game would be too confusing for me or boring, but it was neither.
I would recommend this game, I'm looking forward to Portal 2, haven't played that one yet but I already have high hopes!

400,148476305,76561198289159167,89,5,432,0,432,1677440437,"Portal, a puzzle-platformer game is an absolute masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on the world of video gaming. From its innovative gameplay to its darkly humorous narrative, Portal offers an experience that's both intellectually stimulating and highly entertaining.

The core gameplay mechanic of Portal revolves around the use of a device known as the ""Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device"" or simply the ""portal gun."" With this device, players can create two interconnected portals on walls, floors, and ceilings. This simple yet brilliantly executed concept allows for a wide range of mind-bending puzzles that challenge your spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills. The puzzles become progressively more complex as you advance through the game, which keeps you engaged and motivated to solve each one.

What sets Portal apart from other puzzle games is its witty and darkly comedic narrative. You play as Chell, a silent protagonist, who awakens in the Aperture Science research facility and is guided by GLaDOS, a malevolent AI with a penchant for sarcasm. GLaDOS's humorous and increasingly sinister commentary adds a unique layer of personality to the game. Her lines have become iconic, and players will remember them long after finishing the game.

The pacing of Portal is impeccable. The game is relatively short, but it's tightly packed with memorable moments, challenging puzzles, and unexpected twists. It never outstays its welcome, leaving players craving more rather than feeling fatigued.

The minimalist visual design of Portal is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The sterile, clinical look of the Aperture Science facility juxtaposes beautifully with the colorful, otherworldly portals themselves. This contrast not only serves the gameplay but also enhances the immersion in the game's unique atmosphere.

Portal's soundtrack is another standout element. The ambient, electronic music perfectly complements the game's atmosphere, providing an eerie and memorable backdrop to your puzzle-solving adventures.

Overall, Portal is a game that has rightly earned its place in the gaming hall of fame. Its innovative gameplay, dark humor, and clever level design make it a must-play for anyone interested in puzzle games or gaming in general. Even years after its release, Portal continues to be a beloved classic, and its influence can be seen in countless other games that followed. If you haven't had the pleasure of experiencing Portal yet, do yourself a favor and dive into this mind-bending and thoroughly enjoyable adventure.

""Portal"" isn't just a game; it's a mind-bending experience that challenges your intellect and captivates your imagination. Developed by Valve Corporation, this puzzle-platformer stands as a shining gem in the gaming industry, renowned for its innovative gameplay, sharp wit, and immersive storytelling.

At its core, ""Portal"" is a testament to the power of creativity. The game's central mechanic, the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, offers a refreshingly unique approach to puzzles. Creating interlinked portals on surfaces not only serves as a means of traversal but also opens a Pandora's box of ingenious challenges. The puzzles start deceptively simple, lulling you into a false sense of security before gradually ramping up in complexity. Each solution feels like a triumph, rewarding players with a satisfying sense of accomplishment.

What truly sets ""Portal"" apart, however, is its narrative finesse. Through the disembodied voice of GLaDOS, the sinister yet hilariously deadpan artificial intelligence, players are guided through a series of tests that gradually peel back the layers of Aperture Science's mysterious past. The witty and often dark humor adds depth to the story, making every moment engaging and memorable.

Visually, the game's minimalist design is elegant and effective. The sterile, clinical environments of Aperture Science juxtapose the game's complex puzzles, creating an atmosphere that is both eerie and awe-inspiring. The subtle details in the environment, combined with the game's excellent physics engine, enhance the immersion, making the player feel like an integral part of this enigmatic world.

Moreover, ""Portal"" boasts an unforgettable antagonist in GLaDOS. Her sarcastic remarks and unpredictable behavior keep players on their toes, turning what could have been a mere sequence of puzzles into a narrative-driven experience.

In the realm of video game storytelling, ""Portal"" stands tall as a pioneer of its genre. Its intelligent puzzles, combined with a compelling narrative and sharp humor, create an experience that is as mentally stimulating as it is emotionally resonant. Whether you're a fan of puzzles, a lover of compelling narratives, or just someone seeking an unforgettable gaming experience, ""Portal"" is an absolute must-play that will challenge your mind and leave you craving more.",1697645689,1697645689,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nothing too fancy or complicated. I also have a love for story-driven games and, as of typing this, I'm deeply obsessing over the story line behind this game.

There is something to say about how we understand how technologies of today will scale and impact us in the future, something which I believe has been a trend in human history for a very long time. 

The subtle nod to stories based in reality often go overlooked and under-appreciated in the over-the-top spectacle of entertainment. The game is a very deliberate on-the-nose appreciation of that role in fictional media. But across the story-telling landscape we are full of lessons told but lessons not practiced. 

There is a lot more to get into and its not about seeking change in the world because one wants to be disruptive, but because we inherently believe in doing what is right and opposing that which is not and the hope that stems from that in what many can view as a forlorn world.

Guess I'll do the advanced chambers before uninstalling. Cheers.

In a sense, we can probably chalk up a lot of creative modern experiments in gameplay in today's triple A and indie titles alike to the legacy of Portal, which really showed how familiar game genres can be turned into something completely new, as well as introducing the world to new ways of using simulated physics for mind-bending puzzles that are equal parts intuitive and alien.

 One thing to realize going into Portal however, this game can be *far* more difficult at times than you might expect. It's gameplay focus on physics puzzles rather than combat may lead some to mistakenly assume that this is a ""casual"" title that's more about idle fun than challenge, but that could not be further from the truth. There will be some points later on where this game will make you never want to see another downward > forward momentum puzzle for as long as you live. The main game is short, but in my opinion the difficulty gets high enough in the back half that I wouldn't expect to breeze through it especially quickly as a first-time player unless maybe simulated wormhole physics just clicks with you unusually well (and even if you do fall into that latter demographic, there are more difficult bonus and challenge maps that you can attempt as well). If you're someone who gets easily frustrated with finicky and time-sensitive puzzles, I'd suggest caution with Portal. Luckily, the quick save system is *extremely* generous, so you can essentially just ""save scum"" your way through the most complicated and unforgiving test chambers if all else fails. In any event, Portal rewards perseverance, and practice will make the surreal physics more familiar with time. 

 Also, while there isn't really any combat in the traditional sense (without going into spoilers, yes, there *are* enemies, of a sort, but the things you have to do to defeat them aren't exactly what I'd call ""fighting""), it *is* possible to die at many points, and at some points you will probably end up dying *a lot* before you get things just right (again, due to the generosity with saves, dying isn't particularly punished, though).

For any Half-Life fans out there; yes, this game does take place in the same universe, although this doesn't really become readily apparent until the very end apart from a couple of small easter eggs that the observant might pick up on. Familiarity with Half-Life is absolutely not essential, though.

 In conclusion, this is a game that still holds up very well more than a decade and a half later, and which I'd highly recommend, especially if recent games like Tears of the Kingdom have gotten you interested in physics puzzles.

BEFORE WE BEGIN:
The game was tested in the Still Alive version, 100% completed and the platinum trophy has been obtained.

A WILD PORTAL APPEARS!:
Portal, as a typical Valve title, features impeccable level design and attention to detail right from the start. From the first minutes of play, everything is structured to create an exponential learning curve; initially the player will find himself inside a closed cell as Chell, a young girl who has been hired to test some new Aperture Science technology. Apparently, the capsule in which Chell lingers would appear to have no way out, but after a few seconds, thanks to the appearance of a portal, the player will be free to begin testing the various chambers of the Aperture facility. From there on, the player will be faced with several tests, and when he or she has mastered the blue portal, he or she will also unlock the orange one, kicking off the full potential of the game.

A NEW CUBY FRIEND:
As can be inferred from the name of the game or the introduction of the review, it is all about using portals, mainly two, one blue and one orange. These portals do not have different characteristics, but are actually unlocked at different times so that the player can figure out how to use one at a time. Several other mechanics are present, which in the same way as the portals are explained right from the start, namely the use of cubes to press buttons; obviously it is very intuitive as a mechanic, but combined with the use of portals to reach tricky buttons makes it more fun and complicated. Other mechanics rely on dodging and destroying deadly turrets, or repelling energy orbs in order to activate passages. Plot-wise, the first chapter does not hold a candle to the second, with a rather simple story with few narrative twists.


HEY, THAT’S ME!:
Graphically Portal awakens perfectly to a game of its era; moreover, due to its simplicity the game becomes almost immortal. Obviously, the aesthetics of the logos and the use of colors in the right situations are excellently done.

HEARING THE RADIO:
From an audio standpoint, there is not much to discuss; the use of sound effects to make clear the use of the various game objects and their interaction with the environment is excellent. 

ACHIEVEMENTS:
The achievements in this title are fairly simple and quick to complete. The Still Alive version of Portal provides several extra levels to tackle and two challenges in the campaign that are rather tough, namely finishing the game without ever being hit by turrets and finishing it by going only through orange portals. The latter is an obvious easter egg to the Valve’s Orange Box collection and provides a more thoughtful approach to the game's puzzles.

BUT WHY 9?

PROS - CONS:
All in all, the original Portal does not have much to discuss; all the pros have already been mentioned in the parts above; of negative points, however, I personally struggle to find any, as it really is a near-perfect game. Small appreciable detail in both Portal is the Commentary mode, where the developers explain their approach in the making of this title, useful for young programmers or more commonly for curious players.

 I didn't know what to expect when I first loaded up Portal, as I bought the orange box set just to play the Half-life games. It turned out to be one of my all time favourite games, it was just a shame it was short.

It's Portal, it's not just one of Valve's best, its arguably one of the most recognisable games in existence. You can't touch PC without at least knowing of it, shit, it might as well be on everyone's account considering its sale history. Despite all that, this is the first time I've ever played it. Since the task became an afterthought for me at a certain point, there was little surprise or anticipation to play it for the same reason I won't give it a proper review. It is TOO famous, it is TOO talked about, but for good reason. It is a must play, a game of tremendous legacy. It's a piece of history.
