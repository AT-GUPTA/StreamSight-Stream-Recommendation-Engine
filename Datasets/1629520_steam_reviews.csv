I personally have 3 Problems, but those are completionist related. 1. The no Hint Achievement is placed further below the use a hint achievement. So because of this i used a hint on purpose to get the achievement and later deeply regret because i will need to wait some time till i can go through the game again without getting bored. I would just leave the: let it be achievement and use a hint achievement away, then a clean walkthrough would also be more interesting to achieve.
2. Having Achievements for the DLC is cool, but that they are placed in the main game again means: i have to buy the dlc to get 100%.
3. Having Dailys in a short puzzle Game is a big no go for me. I only Accept those in games where progress is basically optional like in Fortnite. If i dont care about the Battle Pass, i dont need to come back daily. At the same time those games are designed to be played forever, while this game is linear and when youre done youre done. Just as a completionist you have to come back daily to do those. Not a good decision imo.

I think that this game is a fantastic puzzle game when you just need a little bit of relaxation. Why worry about the tidiness of your life IRL when you can sit down and organize some batteries, rocks, and buttons into a cute little organized container! While that may sound sarcastic, I do think that this game is great for relaxation and when you just need to feel a little bit of satisfaction. There is just something incredibly rewarding about seeing all these odds and ends fitting together in exactly the right way that can put you in a pleasant mood. For the most part, I thought that this game did a really good job at providing unique puzzles that were all different in their own way. Further, while the story line was not overly apparent, there was an underlying theme to follow if you are paying attention. With the extensive puzzle list and the occasional ""events"" around holidays, you can get a pretty good amount of game play out of this game. Not to mention that several of the puzzles have multiple solutions if you just organize them in a different way. My biggest upset with this game surrounds the daily tidies and getting all of the badges for completing 100 of them. I found that there was really not a significant amount of variability when it came to the daily tidy, so it felt almost like pulling teeth to obtain that steam achievement and get all of the badges. I grew bored pretty quick of doing the same several puzzles over and over again in order to do it for 100 different days. I wish that there were more puzzles in the rotation so that it didn't feel like it grew stale and boring after a short period of time. The price of the game, I would say, is pretty decent. I might recommend grabbing it on sale rather than the full $15 price tag, but I also wasn't particularly angry at the price. All together with all the game achievements and to play through all the puzzles, I got a good 11 hours or so of game play. It was very easy to get all of the steam achievements, though some of them do require a decent amount of grinding, patience, and several days worth of your time. All and all, I would highly recommend picking up this game if you like puzzles, organization, and feeling satisfied!

TL/DR:
Fantastic game! The price point is pretty decent for the game play, but I would recommend getting it on sale. The DLCs also do help to extend your game play. The steam achievements are 100% manageable, but it does require at least a little bit of dedication and grinding for a few of them. The daily tidies are my biggest gripe, with them getting boring and repetitive very early on, making it annoying to get all the daily tidy badges for the achievement. It is fun, relaxing, and very satisfying. The puzzles are overall very unique, and the art style/animation is adorable.",1708186052,1708186052,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has a bad flow, with slow switches between puzzle, menu and so on. Additionally the cutscenes are boring and un-skipable. 

I like the idea of the star system they use for multiple solutions, but immo more puzzles should have multiple solutions. 

I don't really like the hints for the levels. First of all, they don't help with multiple solutions (as far as I'm aware), and secondly, they don't explain why you are doing it. Showing a picture of what you are supposed to do is kinda boring, but I guess it's cool that you have to reveal it yourself.

Lastly the daily puzzles suck. Very repetetive, a bug/bad setup here or there, and just kinda boring. Also very easy to just work around the ""daily"" part of doing them. Just an unnecessary padding of extra content, to make the game seem bigger.

I'm giving it 8/10 because it is a relaxing, casual game with great aesthetics. Some of the levels with 2 or more stars can be quite confusing, and the hints only suggest 1 way to solve them, with no words given explaining what you have to do.

It does this excellently by making earlier puzzles easier to build up your understanding of what the game is expecting you to learn. Each puzzle gives you very little instruction as to let you figure it out on your own, which makes solving each puzzle that much more rewarding. Each of the five chapters also focus on different subcategories of spatial puzzle-solving; such as, [spoiler]symmetry, categorical sorting, and overall spatial awareness[/spoiler]. I also think this is extremely well-done.

     One particular thing I really enjoy about this game is how simplistically enjoyable it is. From the [u]relaxing music[/u] to the [u]simple style graphics[/u]; I couldn't ask for more or for less from this game--the simplicity is the [b]perfect[/b] amount.

[h3]Simple Facts[/h3]

---> The game takes about [b]2-4 hours[/b] to play all the way through
---> The size of the game is [b]very small[/b]
---> As of writing this review, there is [b]one[/b] DLC that exists
---> Obtaining the achievement medal on this game means playing through the game a second time, and purchasing the DLC. There are also achievements that are very lengthy considering you must log on to the game to complete the ""Daily Challenge"" 100 different days

[h3]Problems or Cons[/h3]

     There is genuinely very little about which to complain about this game. The only problems I saw while playing it was on two separate occasions I was stuck on a level after having completely finished it; it wasn't advancing. This is kind of up in the air considering this could've easily been my fault, although it did seem like I had everything in place during those two levels. They were both apart of [b]Chapter 3[/b].

     Other than that, the only problem I have about this game is that there isn't any more. You can play this game in a quick [b]2-4 hours[/b] and I honestly wish there was more; however, there is the DLC which I am planning to play. Keep in mind I am not saying this game is too expensive for the amount of gameplay you get; I think the price is fair, especially considering this is an [b]indie game[/b].

[h3]Overall...[/h3]

     I think this is a wonderfully relaxing game to just sit back for a couple of hours and test your own brain. You can even grab a friend if you want to solve the puzzles alongside someone else. This game is everything right about simplistic puzzle games and I would give it a solid

A Little to the Left is the perfect example of a comfortable, casual puzzle game with charming elements and well-executed gameplay. There were some levels that were straightforward, and others where I enlisted friends to help me solve!

I think the core experience is really fun and worth getting the game for (maybe on a sale though, since I finished the main levels *super* quick). The DLC, should you choose to get it, is like another couple hours if you're just playing casually. For what it's worth, it was pretty fun. But then I went to achievement hunt, and this is where my review gets a bit more negative. There are two sets of achievements in this game that I'm not a huge fan of; daily login and locked behind the DLC.

For the daily login, you *can* cheese it by setting your system clock, but doing that 100 times in a row is tedious (trust me, this is how I did it). Additionally, the daily tidy system has very little variety as far as the types of minigames you can do. Overall, it just feels like a bit of a rushed system that you have to invest way too much time into because of the achievements.

The other achievements are locked behind the DLC. At least in some multiplayer games where they do this, you can at least still get the achievements by playing with people who have the DLC, but here you're kinda stuck. Pay up or have a bunch of missing achievements. For some people this isn't a huge deal, but for those who were looking to get this game to achievement hunt in, you will probably want to wait for a sale that bundles the main game and DLC together.

The movements and cutscenes are smooth and calm. In the end through the credit animation, not only players could play and mess around like a cat to finish the achievement, developers' pets animated photos show up; there are not only cats, also dogs, parrots, and guinea pigs!

Some puzzles are more fun than others, and some are questionable how related they are to ""tidying"" (I'm looking at you, snowflake and constellation puzzles), but the main story doesn't take long to complete and is a creative and unique take on a puzzle game. If you don't care about achievements, you can stop reading here.

One thing I will say, is that if you care about getting 100% achievements, this game does not do achievements as well as it could have. In particular, the daily tidy achievements are very tedious. A few would be fine, but you have to complete 100 daily puzzles for the longest one (used to be 365), which playing every single day would take over 3 months to complete. And another one is to do 30 in a row, so if you happen to be on a trip or away from your computer for even 1 day in a month, you have to start over. These daily puzzles just cycle through a handful of the main puzzles too, so it never feels fresh.

Another issue is that even with just the base game, you can see the DLC achievements, which means getting 100% is impossible unless you purchase the DLC. I found that a bit unsatisfying for a game all about sorting items in a satisfying way, and more of a cash grab than anything. The last issue I would call out is that some achievements conflict with each other, such as ""use a hint"" and ""complete the game without hints"" - I didn't see both at first, so I just used a hint for fun to get the ""use a hint"" achievement, and now I have to reset my save and start from the beginning to get the other one.

Even with all that, I would still recommend this game. If you don't care about the achievements, or just go into it knowing that some will be tedious, the game is a lot of fun to play. It has great graphic design and was exactly what I was looking for in a puzzle game. But, if you're trying to 100% it like me, it can become more of a chore at times to get those last few achievements, which takes away from its strengths.",1705418880,1705418880,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The hit boxes and subtle things as small as the way the little X twirls when you close out of the settings? WOW. 

Some of the puzzles are very easy, some are incredibly creative, some are just satisfying as HELL and sometimes they're almost a bit TOO out of the box. The hint design is extremely clever to where you only have to uncover the parts you want, should you want to keep the rest of the puzzle answer unspoiled. The music is also just really nice.

I can't even begin to describe the joy I felt with how satisfying some of the organizing sections were. If you have autistic friends, I'm like 93% sure they will love you for the REST of their lives if you gift them this game. I was screensharing this game to mine and they practically came.

I have never wanted to support a studio more than this one and really look forward to their future work. the DLC is COMPLETELY worth it, this is the first time since playing Outer Wilds where I was 100% confident in my need for the DLC. 

The only thing I have to complain about is the cat, man's is cute but a SABOTEUR and a NUISANCE and a harbinger of CHAOS. And I do think its a bit of a cop-out for some of the DLC levels to literally just be petting the cat by clicking once. But I'll let this one slide, even if the pin-up poses he makes on the moon is kinda weird.

The art style is minimalistic, the colors are pleasant to the eye and the music is relaxing. Perfect for a little breather from real life responsibilities.

The puzzles themselves aren't that hard to figure out, altho the alternative solutions aren't always the most obvious (the third solution for leaves took a while for me). The pacing they created with puzzles is amazing to me since I didn't know that was possible to do. I Love what they did at the end or rather with the puzzles at the end, it gave me a great feel good high.

While I do recommend this game for those who like puzzles and get a kick out of making things tidy, I must say I expected more content out of it. Its a solid 4 hour game (i did all the puzzles including the multiple solutions in this time frame) and for the price it's at i feel like it should have been more content to it, so i recommend getting it on sale if you are used to getting more than 4h of gameplay inside of this price range. 

That said it does have daily puzzles that are different everyday and work up to achievements that give it more replay value, since base puzzles stay the same.

As someone who habitually sorts their effects with purposeful direction, I found myself kicking my feet with glee upon sorting so many of the solutions in this puzzle game. It's hard to put into words, but this particular style of puzzle just makes my brain happy.
Fortunately, puzzles are not constrained to orthodox or practical sorting solutions. Instead, you frequently must perceive overarching patterns in minute details. For example, a series of objects may form a continuous pattern when arranged properly. When properly arranged, the solutions are so satisfying I had trouble tearing myself away from the game.
The puzzles strike a great balance of genuine headscratchers, and simpler yet still gratifying arrangements. A Little to the Left trusts you as a player, offering no tutorials or explanations for its puzzles. Inevitably, there will be the occasional alternate solution which leaves you stumped, and though rare, some of these are not altogether intuitive.
The game wraps up in a surprisingly sweet and arresting ending, and its feline ""antagonist"" is such a cute little fella. Then the DLC presents more involved puzzles which utilize the recurring patterns seen in the base game in larger spaces, often utilizing multiple patterns for different series of objects.
I adore A Little to the Left. No puzzle game has quite scratched the itch like this one, and I was joyous as I played through it. While its specific style is personally appealing, I also just think it's a tremendously charming puzzler all its own, and I encourage you to give it a try.",1704059678,1704059678,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(1) Requiring a 30-day streak and 100-day total for the achievements is ludicrous. (And based on comments in the forums, it used to be WORSE.) I could see maybe, [i]MAYBE[/i], a 7- or 14-day streak and 30-day total. But [i]requiring[/i] players to play your game for over three [i]actual, real-world[/i] months' worth of days is massively hubristic. (2) Unlike in the base game, you don't get credit for a Daily Tidy unless you solve [i]every[/i] possible configuration. Again, this is ridiculous, particularly given that you need an unbroken 30-day streak. You should get credit for the day for solving one; and then each additional solve should count towards your total. (3) The puzzles are either increasingly tedious retreads or (e.g., as with the new Christmas puzzles) unnecessarily abstruse, mistaking obscurity for novelty.
[hr][/hr]
Particularly with the addition of the DLC, [i]A Little to the Left[/i] is a satisfying little puzzle game. I enjoy that quite a few puzzles have 2+ possible solutions, and I appreciate the ""Daily Tidy"" feature. Requiring a 30-day streak to 100% the achievements is a little wild, but them's the breaks. A few of the solutions can be a little abstruse, but that's the nature of puzzle games: it's basically impossible to design something that's going to give a reasonable level of challenge to a broad range of players while also never seeming unreasonable to everybody. Related to that, it's a great aspect of the design that you're not only allowed but encouraged (via achievements) to make use of both hints and the ""Let It Be"" mechanic. There's an in-game way to solve every puzzle; and also an in-game way that being stuck on a puzzle won't prevent you from progressing.",1701293273,1703779201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Clips online that piqued my interest contained the most interesting levels, arranging woodworking tools using what appeared to be a random series of nails on the wall, organising a medicine cabinet where everything aligned perfectly... I had expected most of the puzzles to be as complex as these. Instead, it was mostly lining things up one after the other by size. Perhaps worthwhile for a young person (It feels rude to say child, but there you have it) as worthwhile edutainment, but not for someone seeking a challenging puzzle game.

It is beautiful, I will mention. The art is minimalist in an incredibly appealing way, but I feel the art is what misled me, in part, to believe the game was aimed at a 'mature' audience (for lack of a better term). Still, kudos when they are owed.

Would I recommend it? Well. It's a good tool to teach children logic, or for someone who just wants to move things around on a screen. And frankly, that's about it.",1703483258,1703483258,False,1,1,0.466666668653488159,2,True,False,False

Some puzzles have more than one solution, but the hints are rigid. At least, I think so anyway, I did not see a way to get a hint for an alternative solution. So if you solve a more challenging puzzle but can't figure out the second or third solution, you're left either flailing or giving up. There were a few puzzles as well where I could see a potential solution, but it wasn't a solution that the devs had considered so it doesn't work.

But these were relatively small issues. The one that made me stop and put the game back was the soup can labels. The solution was obvious, yet it wasn't working. I finally gave up and checked the hint, and...I was right. I had been a pixel off of the exact positioning. It had multiple solutions, and I realized then that I probably would not be able to 100% this game. No hints for the alternative solution, and armed with the knowledge that it would have to be pixel-perfect I switched to the next puzzle. Solved it easily, but then found that some of the alternatives that I was coming up with weren't working.

It's not a good fit for me. Only some of the puzzles have a clever ""aha"" moment, and the game has a few intentional moments of making a mess. It might be a good fit for you, so I'd say give it a try and if it doesn't click after an hour, it isn't for you either.",1703390587,1703390587,False,66,0,0.766231119632720947,0,True,False,False

Bought this game and its DLC on a whim after missing a good puzzle game in my life. (Namely, the Professor Layton games lol) And if you really enjoy puzzle games, you should definitely consider picking this one up.
In my opinion, this is a perfectly executed game. It knows exactly what it is, plays well, and the art in it is delightful. I have very little complaints other than just wanting more content. I can imagine how playing it on console might make controls a little bulky - but on PC it was perfect.

The music and sfx were also delightful, making the overall experience very satisfying and stress-free the whole time. I genuinely went to work and day dreamed about playing this game in the evening. It had a lighthearted feeling that I really needed right now.

I think for a very long time I discounted how lovely the sub-genre of ""comfort gaming"" can be in sake of a big dramatic narrative. And while I still love those games, this title really has left a lasting impression on me with just how calm it all felt.

It probably makes me an old lady at heart to enjoy this game THIS much, but thats alright : ]",1703389866,1703389866,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has simple-enough puzzles that will allow you to relax your brain from the world's stress. The achievements are pretty easy and there are online guides already that can help you out to complete them all in case you want to pursue that task. For the ""daily challenges"" achievements though, they can become really repetitive, so what I did was to modify my PC's date to the next days to make the challenges available and complete all of them in one gaming session, and I recommend the same since it can get a bit tedious to complete at some point, if you want to have all the achievements of course.

This game is beyond incredible. The puzzle solutions are clever and extremely satisfying. My favorite solution is the Bread Clip or ""Kwik Lok"" Puzzle in Chapter Two, ""Lost Recipe"". [spoiler] The two obvious solutions, the ones you'd assume that the game is asking for, are sorting by height or by color, as there are 8 pieces, 7 of which share the colors of the rainbow. After trying to put things into place, the red piece, both the biggest and what would go first in the rainbow, locks into the center. That immediately makes the first two supposed solutions impossible. You then realize that the sides of the Bread Clips connect, which solves the puzzle! I personally think this is really well done since It wouldn't have been my first thought to connect them. Reason being, they look about the same as the ones you see on your bread. I believe the misdirect is on purpose, but who knows, maybe this was obvious to others! [/spoiler] But there's also so many other cool puzzles with amazing solutions.

It is a really good casual zen game. I have played both the original game and the DLC, which took probably around 6.5 hours. This and the DLC are both great plays, and as a bonus there is an archive of seasonal/holiday puzzles. For what you pay for in this game, you get a polished game with unique style and puzzles.

I have a few criticisms which do not change my enthusiastic recommendation of this game. As it is a puzzle game and each puzzle is highly memorable I have a harder time recapturing that initial experience where I am trying to solve something rather than remembering how to solve it, which diminishes the replay-ability for me. The controls/snapping into position can be a bit fiddly at times and I would occasionally go around the screen after completing a puzzle picking up and putting things down because one item was a few pixels out of place. I don't like the cat levels in the DLC where the puzzle is clicking the cat. There are too many of them and it inflates the level count without adding the challenge I want out of the game. I wish we could have the Daily Tidies that are new puzzles in an archive like the other holiday puzzles, untethered to achievements.

However, i I have to say, that this game can be so increadibly frustrating at times.
Not on purpose (or at least I hope it wasn't intentional), but accidentally. 

I understand that such games need to limit themselves to only 1-3 possible solutions for each puzzles, but the level designs can not only easily mislead, but also sometimes don't follow the pattern needed for the solution.
Examples I noticed not even 30 minutes into playing the game:

Level 7: books
Why the patterns on the books are so complex when they aren't needed for neither of two possible solutions?
Why the colors/color combinations of the books aren't simplified either? 
Those two things take all the focus and for no reason other than to frustrate the player. 
And yes, I know that it supposed to be one of the ""points"" of the game AKA for the puzzles to not be super easy, but.. No. Most if not all of the other ones are much simpler in the objects's design. Half of the patterns on the books don't even match the simplified aesthetic of the game. On top of that, since it's one of the first levels, it's goal shouldn't be to be confusing or misleading, since it serves the purpose of teaching the player how to play. 

Level 12: Calendar
There are two very similar in color and form kinds of stickers that surprise! don't have anything to do with each other... Why? Who knows, I certainly don't. But that's just a little side complain. The major is that- to my anger- the solution needed for this level don't FULLY FOLLOW THE PATTERN. One (1) single sticker is missing for it to be complete. For it to fully make sense.
Again, why it it's missing? Maybe for the pattern to not be ""so obvious""? Well, the fact there're articles/sities with solutions for the game that litteraly say that the author doesn't even know why that's the solution clearly say that the solution isn't very obvious.

I love puzzle games in all forms (both digital and not) since I was a little kid. I played them for more than half my life, but I think that's the first one that made me rage quit out of frustration over details that could have been super easily avoided. 

I would really want to recommend this game, but I just can't.
The fact that those things are present in the beginning levels of the game makes me worry that they will be present also later on and maybe even in a bigger way. And since those kinds of games (especially with this aesthethic) mostly appeal to people wanting stress-free, cozy playthrough and younger teens/children (or their parents) I just worry that they might be disapointed just like (to some extend) I was.

I will definitely play it to the end since I already bought it and it's enjoyable for the most part, but I'm afraid it won't be a satisfying playthrough.

*Edit: ALSO! Another point why I don't and won't recommend it. The fact many puzzles are based only on colors or gradients and there's no option to make them more friendly to color-blind players is just baffling. It's a VERY easy fix and the game was long enough on the market that there's already a DLC published, so there's absolutely no reason why this accomodation isn't already present.",1702156960,1702157355,False,9,1,0.623170375823974609,0,True,False,False

After purchasing the game I was amazed to see the incredible art style that this game beholds. The designs of each puzzle are detailed in ways that kept me engaged through my play-through of the game. The puzzles in the game are very well planned, and provide a very interesting take on a puzzle game. There were a couple of puzzles where I needed a guide. But overall the puzzles were very good, and I was engaged through every single one. The soundtrack for this game is very beautiful. I enjoyed listening to it while playing the game, and it kept me in a very relaxed state.

In summary, A Little to the Left is an excellent game that has magnificent game art, with very relaxing/interesting puzzles, and a beautiful soundtrack.

Spent 20 minutes playing it and had enough after putting a few items into a basket, moving books in the right order by their height or reorganising notes that were supposed to form some scribbles that didn't make any sense... Many of those expect you to KNOW how to solve/do them. There's zero direction on what the devs want me to do in each level. I don't enjoy redoing something X amount of times hoping that this time it may work.

- The game's multiple solutions for puzzles are intriguing, but finding the specific ""correct"" solution can be elusive. This becomes frustrating when a solution that visually appeals to you is not recognized as valid.
- Puzzle solutions involve various elements like object height, size, color, and symmetry. However, the object snap mechanism, crucial for determining correct placements, feels weak. Objects often need extra adjustments even when they are correctly placed, leading to confusion.
- The game's music was a letdown for me. It's repetitive and simplistic, with some tracks featuring high-pitched tones that were uncomfortable for my tinnitus.
- The narrative is minimal and underdeveloped, especially when compared to ""Unpacking,"" which skillfully tells a story through item progression without any dialogue. A similar storytelling approach in ""A Little to the Left"" could have enhanced the gaming experience.
- I appreciated the flexible solution approach in ""Unpacking,"" where the main rules are item placement in specific rooms and avoidance of clutter on the floor. Implementing a similar flexibility in ""A Little to the Left"" could reduce player frustration.

Maybe I'm biased because I had the privilege to play gems like Unpacking and Birth first but this game is... not good. I was really hoping it would meet the ""cozy puzzle"" game standards of the aforementioned games (which I HIGHLY recommend you check out and purchase instead of this mess). 

I honestly wasn't even going to leave a negative review until it got to a point in the game (around chapter 4) when I continuously had to keep clicking for a hint because the PUZZLES MAKE NO SENSE?!? It became less cozy and actually quite frustrating. 

Another thing to note, too, is that there are some puzzles with multiple ways to solve them, but the game only shows a hint for 1 of the solutions.

A Little to the Left is a fantastic puzzle game for those who find joy in organizing chaos. The gameplay is simple yet satisfying, offering clever puzzles that appeal to both beginners and seasoned players. The minimalist design and soothing soundtrack create a calming atmosphere, perfect for winding down.

I don't really understand why it is in the game? It ruins the feeling you get of completing a puzzle whilst having the relaxing music playing.

Everything is a little lack-luster, it's missing the replay factor, like... I got so bored after an hour.

- Fluffy kitty! Precious, fluffy kitty!

- Fun

- Usually relaxing. Only a few puzzles are stressful (stressful for me anyway), the ones with the symmetrical plant leaves.

- Music is good. I love the chapter 1 song and the ending song!

- The ending is beautiful! I love it!

- Nothing inappropriate. People of any age can play

- I like the achievements and dailies too

Cons:

- Not enough precious, fluffy kitty

- The symmetrical puzzles

- Puzzles that are too easy. It's not only wasted puzzle levels, but it makes it so my favorite music on chapter 1 isn't listened to as long because chapter 1 is easiest and finishes faster than the others! But I guess that's just what happens when my favorite music is on chapter 1.

I played a few levels and felt like the game was a little flat. The same type of game (rainbow/size/number order... over and over). About the time I was ready to quit because I was bored, the game design added some ""arrange these objects into the right size containers"" games... they were a little more engaging and I was excited that the game was leveling up. I kept playing because I felt like it was gonna get good soon.

Unfortunately, it never really went anywhere after that. I wanted some puzzles that were challenging. There were some that were frustrating, but because of what seemed like poor design, not intellectual demand. All I got were more of the same kind of puzzles. Over and over. 

The end was lots of (beautiful and fun) animations that I wanted to click through and get to the next stage, but couldn't. Then it was over. Overall, the game had fun moments but I played through the whole thing in about 3 hours of actual gameplay while watching TV and for me, it never got to truly gratifying puzzles. Was cozy and fun, but not challenging or particularly engaging.

I would give it a 2/5 because I kind of feel like I wasted an evening wishing it was something else. But I think it depends on what you're looking for.

If you're like me, you've heard nothing but good things about A Little to The Left, and that is for a reason! 

The art design is stunningly adorable, beautiful, and polished, the sound design is nothing short of a chef's kiss, and you can tell that at every turn the creators put so much thought and effort into every little detail. The puzzles range from simplistic to challenging and this is furthered by having multiple solutions to various puzzles! It helps you to think inside of the box, outside of the box, and all around! Every time you figure out the solution there is a euphoric feeling of accomplishment (and perhaps a bit of embarrassment from learning you were overthinking the entire thing)!

The replay ability is incredible as well. Not only are you able to go through and play the entire game (and DLC) after just a little time away, but you can also play specific puzzles that particularly piqued your fancy. There is also the addition of ""Daily Tidy's"" which will keep you coming back day after day! 

This is hands down my favorite comfort game and I genuinely thank the creators from the bottom of my heart.",1699106978,1699107107,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What a charming game. Very well made, lots of expression throughout. Very relaxing, made me smile a whole lot. Some genuinely challenging levels, but enough purely relaxing (satisfying, soothing) levels to break up the brain busters. A great sense of wellness after cleaning up some particularly messy situations (Shoutout to the tackle box!) Lovely touches of energy through the physics, and the colour palette, textures and shapes are perfect for the tone of the game. the sound design, particularly the object sounds, are gorgeous.

The overall design is very charming, with an analog vibe and a pleasing color palette. The gameplay is seamless, especially since they added the replay option on the puzzle end screen. It's nice to be able to immediately replay a level for the puzzles with multiple solutions without having to exit and scroll back to it through the menu. I love the concept of the Daily Tidy, and it's always fun to have a new puzzle to play every day.

I cannot believe I spent $20 on this game let alone paid any money for it at all. This is a game that could be purchased on the app store for like $2 if not for free.

EDIT: It appears that a developer has responded to this review. 

Please do understand that while I did enjoy my time with this game, I cannot support daily grind achievements. While there ARE many people who enjoy daily tidies, there are people who DON'T at the same time. By adding these, you're locking several players out of 100% completion.

What if somebody isn't able to get to their computer one day? A 30 day grind achievement is REQUIRED for 100% completion, and if somebody misses a single day? Boom. Done.

I'm sorry, but I still do not think these should be in the game. By rewarding fans of the tidies, you have accidentally created a situation where you've locked several people out of a complete experience. My genuine suggestion is to at least remove the DAILY ones. The 7, 14, 30 ones. These lock a HUGE majority of individuals out of the achievements at hand.

Please do keep in mind, I am a fan of what is here, and I would legitimately love to give this game a positive review for the gentle puzzles and serene atmosphere.

The game itself is very calming and keeps you occupied with fun puzzles which I enjoyed, however the price is way too high for this kind of game. The game itself can be finished in a couple of hours and then there really isn't anything else to do. The replay value of the game is low as it is just puzzles you solve once (or twice if you want to get all the solutions). I definitely recommend getting it on sale if you're planning to buy it, but overall the design and music of the game is great and it is a cute idea. In my opinion, there should have been way more levels and more to do in the game besides the daily tide. Some of the levels are also not puzzles at all and just require you to click a few times on the screen which was disappointing. The organizing levels with the cupboards and drawers from the dlc were by far the best and there should have been way more of them.

The DLC was entertaining, lots of interesting puzzles, I especially liked the jewellery box puzzle.

I'm a little on the fence on the pricing, perhaps with a few more levels towards the end of the DLC I'd have a different opinion.

Cupboards and Drawers DLC: The new DLC adds 25 new levels with some interesting new mechanics of how to organize and is a great expansion for anyone who enjoyed the base game. It's another cute addition with little breaks for reprieve about ever 5 levels or so that involve petting the cat (which makes it more than worth my money). 5.5/10

not a fan of the achievements that require clean playthroughs as well, since they contradict other achievements. for example, one requires you to skip a puzzle, but another one requires you to complete the entire game without ever skipping. why.

These puzzles range from sorting items into compartments, arranging stacks of boxes or finding hidden patterns in everyday objects.

The puzzles are of a very nice difficulty, never going too far off of the deep end, although I would argue that a few can be a bit unclear as to what the end goal ultimately is. Still, a handful of the puzzles you encounter have multiple solutions, which it encourages you to explore and find all of. I personally found this to be quite enjoyable as often I would find one solution, and come back later to explore it with a different mind and find the other solutions.

The game also has some sort of daily new puzzle system which appears to make variants of existing puzzles in the game, leading to a nice treat should you wish to check in each day for a few minutes of thinking.

I'd recommend this for anyone looking for a very light and relaxing puzzle game. Bonus recommend if you're a cat lover as you'll often find your progress charmfully impeded by a feline friend.",1693784182,1693784182,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

so the BAD first :
like eg the Daily Tidies have a very small number of puzzles but since those are tied to multiple achievements, so you have to do lots of them & then it becomes rather a chore since they repeat very often & if you on top dislike one of the puzzles, then you will have a bad time while playing.
another annoyance is the paid DLC tied to a set of the base game's steam achievements, so before you buy be aware that if you don't buy the DLC as well, your achievements will remain incomplete.

the MIXED second :
in general i find actually the price a bit steep for what the game has to offer, since the replayability value is very low. the graphics are lovely & well made, navigation is overall pretty smooth though at times a bit clicky & confusing but it's nothing gamebreaking. the music can be jarring at times when you sit on a puzzle for a longer time & the music is repeating in a very small loop of the same sounds over & over & over again. at least you can mute the music separate to the other sounds.

the GOOD last :
so what's the good aside of the design & general nifty idea ?
it's a unique game with a very consistent idea & not striving to be something else. many of the puzzles are also NOT forcing you to do it the preprogrammed way but the game accepts YOUR solution, YOUR placement, YOUR sequence, which offers at least a bit of replayability since you can try other placements later on.
the game has also a good variety of puzzles & doesn't remain in the same pattern. on top, should you have extreme difficulty with a puzzle you can always use the in game Hint or if even that isn't enough, the nice community provided solutions as Guides.
the game is also pretty humourous & a bit cheeky, which gives a relaxing vibe not to take tidying up too seriously.
i am not sure if i should mention the addition of CATS under the label of ""good"" but maybe you are a cat lover, so you will be pleased to know there are some innovative cats inclusions in the game ^^

i hope the devs stay on course, improve the Daily Tidies with time by adding all of the game's puzzles into it. & maybe also with time there will be more DLCs at a bit lower price, cause the length to price ratio is a bit steep imo.

if tidying up & straighten fills you with satisfaction & if you have fun organizing things along different patterns & methods or if you just want to take a peak into the realm of compulsive organizers A Little to the Left is your chance.",1693559022,1693559022,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To be completly honest. I expect much less from this game and though that you got some boring levels where you just tidy it and than the end but honestly. I am a cat lover and the end of the game really got my heart. 


For me only minus is the price. If it would be for about 10€ or $10 that would be much better because it sadly is not worth buying it at it's full price.

But for the price minus i guess the game can be made up for the difficulty of later on levels. They don't get easier and I personally used a guide because there would be no other way for me to finish it.

Honestly. I fully recomend it for buying if it's on sale and you are very bored and got nothing to play. This game may take like 2-4 hours to complete without any help but no one said it would be easy. So yeah, honestly recomended by me.",1693351182,1693351182,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

if you are more into organising things by shape, colour or order, the DLC is a really nice bonus to have, as the base game has all sorts of puzzles other than organising such as symmetry puzzles. (although these are sometimes confusing)

I quite like the fact the game doesn't 'punish' players for not understanding the puzzles so you can have unlimited hints which don't affect scores. But also the game encourages players to find multiple solutions to certain puzzles so you can't be wrong on these specific puzzles.

As the game continues on, puzzles become more difficult to a point of it seemingly not making any sense or indications of how the puzzle needs to be solved. Nothing is explained on HOW a player is to discern if they have the correct answer other than a bell indicator which gets lost in the music which also has bells in it. When a player gets too frustrated and needs help, the hint menu either literally gives you the answer OR has nothing to do with the actual puzzle. There is no middle ground of nudging you in the right direction to solve. Through the power of the internet I was told that the star rating system after you solve a puzzle is based on HOW you found the solution, rather than how fast/accurate you came to the answer. The games never indicates that a puzzle can be solved in more than one way. The lack of direction, indications, and confirmations makes this game not enjoyable [for me].

If you would enjoy a puzzle with absolutely no hand holding until you want a ""hint"", this game may be for you.

this game was actually rather stressful at times, as when i thought i had finished the puzzle, the game demanded i went into OCD mode to complete the level. such as, items being in a perfect exact order, even though on other levels it didn't matter, to the point where i felt it was more a chore to complete the level, than satisfying. 

and yes i understand the difference between neat & tidy vs OCD.

the DLC was a lot shorter than i thought it was going to be, personally i feel it should of been 2x as long as the amount of levels that were in it, making my purchase worth it.

i do like the free daily puzzle, but i don't see myself coming back to the game everyday to play it, now that i have completed all the puzzles in all the multiple ways to gather all the achievements. 

also the game promises to see the cat quite often, but i barely saw the cat throughout the game, only popping up at a few seconds, or replacing a slot of a puzzle in the dlc, where i literally just move my mouse over the cat.

Ah tidying and organizing things. I loved tidying and organizing things as a kid and I still do now. Stacking papers (or paper-like things) in order from biggest to smallest, organizing books in various different ways (while keeping a book series together), organizing drawers and making sure all the measuring cups/spoons are together, organizing things by color, and oh boy the maddening task of trying to get a frame perfectly straight on a wall. On one hand it’s going to bother you for a while (and whenever you notice it again), but on another you’ll forget about it eventually and not sweat about it as much. Not to mention some annoyances like where do I put multi/duochrome polishes or when you have a whole book series in paperback…except one that was only available in hardcover (and is thus taller than the paperbacks). Anyway, the point is, when I saw A Little to the Left it felt like a game I had to check out eventually. I like tidying things up and this game is about tidying things up. Win win.

A Little to the Left, as you probably expect, forgoes a story to purely be about the tidying up puzzles. Though, it does seem like a lot of these were caused by your cat who seems to love messing up your meticulously tidied places and do the classic “knocking things off the table” cat move. The game is separated into five chapters where about 80-ish puzzles are organized in based on whatever theme they fall into.

A Little to the Left is pretty simple, but there are a lot of puzzle variations as well as objects that you’ll be interacting with. The tidying and organizing itself starts out pretty simple and does build up in complexity a bit (just a bit, it never gets too complex). At first, as well as sprinkled in throughout, we get super simple levels like straightening frames and meticulously placing everything in their place on a desk; but it builds as you soon find yourself organizing books, a kitchen drawer, and boxes. Making sure everything is in their right place and is in the right order. Aside from trying to figure out the solution, all you need to do is drag the items around to the right place (or in certain levels click or pluck). Your cat also makes an appearance every once in a while to playfully swipe at your work.

It’s important, though, to remember that a lot of levels keep symmetry in mind. There are purely levels where you have to make things symmetrical (in the last half of the game though), but if there’s items in a level that are symmetrical, share color schemes or could be made into a color gradient, or even items that together make a design or are alternating directions it’ll call for you to have it symmetrical. Sometimes it’s easy to forget, or not know early on, but most of the time the level isn’t completed that’s why.

Honestly, I think my favorite levels were those that I actually do in real life like organizing books and drawers. And I think those are the levels the game does best since there are a few levels that I didn’t feel really fit (which all show up in the last chapter).

There is a hint system here in the form of a scribbled out notebook. All you have to do is erase the scribbles to see the hint. Although, it’s less of a hint and more giving you the solution, or the main solution for those with multiple solutions. I actually didn’t look at hints apart from maybe an handful, though it was useless for multi-solution levels since the hint usually is a solution you already figured out (aka the easiest solution). So I wouldn’t use hints unless you want a solution (and especially if you want the achievement where you don’t look at the hints). There’s also a “Let it Be” option which serves as a skip so you don’t have to be stuck if you’re someone that doesn’t want to look up the solutions.

Though, there were some personal disappointments and annoyances for me. There were a couple of levels that I didn’t like, which turned out to be a level where you arrange a stack of boxes (that one was so annoying) and the plant symmetry level where you’re plucking leaves (and if you pluck the wrong one all leaves regrow). At first, the levels where you create a symmetrical pattern with objects was one that annoyed me too, mainly since I got one as a daily tidy before I got to it in the main game and was doing every other possible solution, but it grew on me as I was doing the daily tidies. I did also think some were a bit too obtuse or a specific part of a level was a bit too specific (or even one where it has the crumbs be part of the solution rather than throwing it away like before). There were some that didn’t quite make sense until I saw the solution. Not to mention the last level going on for a bit too long.

I did expect there to be more levels with multiple solutions as well, and it didn’t help that there were some one-solution levels that I found other solutions for. Like the egg carton one, which I tried organizing it like I usually do rather than what the game wanted.

I also did wish levels with multiple solutions gave you a choice on replaying rather than automatically going to the next level like usual (when you’re playing through the first time). Or having it as a setting. I, personally, liked getting all the possible solutions at the same time rather than going back later and it was a bit annoying having to exit out to select the level again.

I did hear the cat annoyed a lot of people, but for me the cat didn’t annoy me. Maybe it’s because the cat was silently toned down a bit before I bought A Little to the Left, or maybe I was doing the levels the cat can mess up too quickly, or maybe it’s because I had a cat before for years as a kid; either way I’d say don’t let this aspect turn you away specifically. I honestly was expecting the cat to have more of a presence as it did, but it just made the occasional appearances and I did find it easy to fix up what it did mess up anyway.

While the main game will only last for a limited time, there is a bit of the game that asks you to return to the game every day. A Little to the Left has a “Daily Tidy” section of the main menu, which everyday will give you a quick tidy puzzle for you to do before it resets at midnight. Daily Tidy takes a handful of levels and remixes objects or patterns to try to keep it fresh. For the most part it’s okay, but I didn’t like the constellations or the plant symmetry tidies. Though, this is where I came to love the symmetrical pattern ones. Luckily, you can just change your system’s time if you don’t want to wait. Or you want to play the Christmas and Easter Daily Tidies without waiting (and honestly, I think the Christmas ones were my favorites).

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
For the most part, I did like A Little to the Left. Like I said in the beginning, I like tidying and organizing things in real life so a game where you do that felt like it was made for me. While it did fall short in some aspects, I did still like playing through all the levels and couldn’t keep myself on a “one chapter per day” plan. It’s good and if this is the type of thing you do in your life, or this puzzle type appeals to you, I do recommend it. 

Though, I would wait until it goes on sale. I got the game for around $11 and had a little bit under 7 hours, after completing the game and getting all but nine daily tidy achievements, and I felt it was worth it. And even better, since there is DLC and a bundle, if the main game is discounted you can get the bundle for a bit over the price of just the main game when it’s not discounted.

Hints are typically just flat out answers for 1 completion method, and kill immersion by requiring several steps to view and return to the puzzle: ESC>Hints>Manually erase scribbles on notepad>Onscreen 'X'>Resume) each step with a ~1-2 second animation that has to play

Don't get this game because it looks 'aesthetic' or 'cute.' Get it if you enjoy puzzles. Also, get it on sale. 20 seems too much for this and I'd rather buy it for 10.

I am not recommending this game because I don't think there's anything to do after completing the game. The 'daily tidy' is often reused levels. It ranges from making something look like a mirror of itself with plants to burning candles from long to short. That one package level will make you want to cuss the living hell out of the world.

I say that because some of the puzzles require so weird, surreal logic and I know that isn't what everyone is looking for. I overall really enjoy this game, from the design to the puzzles, but I do have some criticisms of the game. Not everything I list is in any particular order nor does it mean this game is bad at all.

Pros: 
- I enjoy that some levels have one solution and others have multiple solutions. It stems from the idea that not everyone 
   organizes things the same, so with levels with books or stacks, I tended to organize them by thickness

- The colors and design are simplistic without having no distinct style. It also made it a bit easier on my eyes 

- Each chapter had a unique theme to organization that wasn't only limited to stationary. I personally liked this because I 
   enjoy all sorts of organizing 

- The cat is very cute and it adds little mischief to the game 

- I liked some of the challenges of the puzzles and some of the achievements are interesting. I enjoyed the surreal like 
   puzzles near the end of the game. It gave something more to the game

- Daily tidy is a cute feature and adds a layer to the game that makes it seems like a game I can come to consistently

Cons:
- Puzzles at the beginning of the game are easy, but can become more difficult and less logical. Finding other solutions 
   may also be difficult to understand. I didn't necessarily mind this but some of the hints for these levels didn't make much 
   sense to me

- Sometimes there isn't much distinction between some colors, making it a bit difficult for some puzzles

- Some achievements are not something you would even think of doing unless you look up how to get that achievement

A point I don't necessarily want to add is pricing. I personally have no issue with the pricing and I also got this game during the summer sale. I think there is a decent amount of content for the price and I know I'll play this game a lot, even when I do finish all of the levels and the achievements. However, I know pricing can be an issue for others and I do think the DLC on it's own is a bit too much and probably could've been added as part of the game. If pricing is really an issue for you for how much content is there in the base game, I would get it on a sale.",1690331398,1691298804,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As many people pointed out, however, some puzzles may seem counter intuative (e.g. you think the books need to be arranged by their height/width, but, in actuality, they need to be arranged using a tiny, almost unnoticable at first detail). Thankfully, there's usually a hint to guide you to, at the very least, one of the available solutions. There's also Daily Tidy, which gives you a daily challenge to complete and rewards for completing certain amounts of them, making getting the 100% completion slightly harder. Nevertheless, most of these barely deduct any fun from the gameplay. There's also plenty of calming music and a cat. 9/10, would recommend to anyone, regardless if you like the genre.

The music was nice to listen to while trying to solve all of these puzzles.
The hint system doesn't give away too much when you use it, which is nice for those who want a little help, but not having the whole thing spoiled.
Also can't forget the best part about this game: There's a cat! 

DLC: Cupboards and Drawers:
The DLC is just like the base game with even more puzzles to test your mind and give you the ""Oh! So Satisfying!"" moments that your heart desires. They aren't too challenging, but if you are trying to go for that 100% completion like i did, you most likely will be there for a while guessing the possible answer.

It is a type of game that is perfect for relaxing after a hard day with a cup of tea (or a glass of wine). 
But I, like many others, found the game maybe a bit too short for that kind of money, even after purchasing the DLC. I thought that Daily Tidies would expand the game and provide some unique levels (considering that a new Daily Tidy becomes available only after 12 hours). But I was quite disappointed to discover that it is just repurposed levels of the main game. I don't really think it's fair that the makers of the game made almost half of the achievements for Daily Tidies. So, the players will have to wait months to 100% the game.

Let's start with the positives:
-It is an incredibly aesthetically pleasing game! Cute graphics, a nice art style, and a color palette that is very soothing on the eye without having that incredibly monotone beige thing going on or only being pastel. All in all: very pretty!
-The puzzles, overall, are quite nice. I love the cupboard Idea, I like the range in difficulty for the most part and as a casual, sometimes nicely tricky, puzzle game it is very nice. There are several levels where I went: ""Oh that's a neat Idea!"" after figuring it out
-I really like the puzzles with 3 or more answers, those were always fun

Now the negatives:
-For the price, especially the new DLC price, it is not enough gameplay by far. The DLC cost 6 euros and I almost felt robbed by the lack of content, there's only so much you can do with the concept, but we'll get to that
-Some Levels feel rushed or made with very little love. Levels like that Seashell ordering one don't have that sorting feeling that makes so much sense, where it might be tricky in parts, but generally intuitive. It felt like its simply the prettiest way of arranging the shells according to the makers. It just feels illogical... And I really hate that. Yes tricky, even very tricky is fine. But it has to be solvable, not through trial and error, but logic.
-please stop with the cat levels. It's a cute gimmick, but there were 3 or 4 (maybe more) so-called ""levels"" in the DLC that were simply clicking on the kitty to ""pet"" it. It felt like the makers were just trying to increase the level count in the DLC without more work.
-some levels with only one answer also feel like they were made for a 3rd grader. Cute, but not what I'd expect for that price
-very repetitive in parts, again I like the drawer-type sorting idea a lot, but not for it to be every level. Some ideas are just overdone without adding any new spin most of the time

All in all: I enjoyed this a lot while playing and was very excited about the DLC which immensely disappointed me in the end. It's cute, but thinking about it now it is very overpriced and it's just that: kinda cute, very pretty but nothing groundbreaking. Get it or don't get it, you're probably really gonna like it, but there is also a lot to improve and change and you're gonna have to live with that.",1690809600,1690809845,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can pat the cat. /ᐠ ̥  ̮  ̥ ᐟ\ฅ

There is no plot to follow, it's just about cleaning up the house. The cat is cute though.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You solve various puzzles by rearranging small parts of the house or cleaning in short levels. In between you can pet the cat from time to time. The puzzles aren't too difficult and repetitive in places, but never to the point that it bothered me.

DLC: I loved the idea of the idea of the Cupboards and Drawers being the main focus of the DLC, Those were some of my favorite levels as well. My favorite level in the DLC was the jewelry box, hands down. I loved the idea of secret compartments that only opened a certain way! I thought more of the levels would be like that honestly, and found many of them to be too simple. I was also not a fan of the fact there were 4 levels that involved just petting a cat?? I wish that had led into a puzzle for the actual level, like the cat jumps out of the drawer and now you have to tidy it. Just a personal nitpick, other than that I loved it as much as the original.

The game is definitely satisfying, but that's it's biggest plus side, so if you don't care much for challenging gameplay and just want to relax, it's a worthwhile purchase.

The ""Daily Tidy"" doesn't offer much in terms of replay value, but I can at least appreciate the developers' attempt to giving the game some sort of long-term playability. I would love to see a game that focuses solely on the compartment-sorting puzzles, as these ones (particularly the shed) felt satisfying to work through and solve, as well as being some of the only puzzles in the game that I didn't blow through in 30 seconds.

Solutions are well explained through hints you can use if you get stuck and most of the levels you can just outright skip. The only two things I dislike are the plant symmetry puzzles and the daily tidy achievements. 

The plant symmetry puzzles are horribly explained, difficult to keep track of, and can easily soft-lock you even once you know what you're doing. It's not very fun in the slightest and more annoying than anything. This could've been easily fixed by avoiding locking selections permanently once made and instead highlighting the ones you want to keep. That way the outliers that grow back can be easily identified and if you select one by mistake you can simply undo the selection. 

The daily tidy on the other hand is a perfectly fine feature by itself, but what really sucks is that the achievements require you to go on [b]month long streaks[/b] and check in for [b]100 days.[/b] That's just stupid. I personally will probably do it anyways just cuz I find this game very fun, but grinding achievements aren't fun.

I expected there to be more levels like the ones shown in the game preview where you organize things neatly. Instead there were a bunch of random tasks like the one where you tilt picture frames (not center, but tilt them diagonally to the side) which I found confusing as the game says to organize things in a pleasing way, and the way it wanted me to organize these was just distressing.

Also, even when I followed the hints to arrange items as portrayed in the hint, I was still not able to pass some of the levels.

For example there's a pegboard where you hang tools, but it's entirely unclear what the points on the tools are that will  interact with the pegs, sometimes going so far as communicating with the player incorrectly that some parts CANNOT be used to hang the tools because they don't grip.. until you find the one place that they can.

The game is at its best when the puzzles are extremely simple and obvious and just pleasant to advance through.  The trickier ones are just poorly tuned.  Puzzle design is hard, but if you choose to make a puzzle game that's the stuff you have to get right.

The game includes hints, which is a good idea.  However, most of them are really not hints at all, just showing you the solution state instead of giving you a hint as to how to get there.  As a result, for some puzzles, the ""hint"" leaves nothing for you to consider at all, just copy the layout.  For others, it gives you no help at all, as you still have no idea how to achieve that layout, even if you might have already been trying to achieve it. As above, hinting for puzzles requires laborious play-testing, but it's simply part of delivering quality puzzle experiences.

I will add that the DLC gets a lot right that the base game did not.  It would probably be more worth it to buy the DLC without the base game if that was an option, but it's not.",1689033067,1689719672,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

I really enjoyed this game while it lasted, but it is WILDLY short. I bought the game on sale and still don't feel like I got my moneys worth. The credits started rolling and I said, ""Wait, that's it?"" I might give the DLC a go, and the daily puzzles are nice, but man, there's really not at all a lot of content. I can't buy games SUPER often so when I do, I want it to last.
Out of the 4.4 hours the game has been open, I think about 3 of that was actual gameplay- including at least 5 daily puzzles. 

I suggest this game if you have the spare $15 and are only looking for a few hours of puzzles, or if you're new to puzzle games and it takes you a good while time to solve them. If you're looking for a full game that'll take you days or weeks to finish, or you can only buy games every so often, I wouldn't get this. I also don't suggest this for serious/hardcore puzzle players- while the puzzles are great, you'll whiz through this in less than half a day.

Other notes:
+The art is wonderful. The way the game is drawn is so lovely and perfect for a puzzle game.
+The vibes are cozy. This is a great game to play on a rainy day off, snuggled up in bed.
+I love the idea behind the game of constantly having to fix what a mischievous cat messes up, and I love that we see the cat so much!
+The puzzles DO make you think- there are a few general ideas they tend to reuse, but for the most part, each puzzle is solved in unique, interesting ways you don't see in many other puzzle games.
+The devs clearly love this game and it comes through. I appreciate that, and many others will, too. I feel better about spending the money on this game knowing it went to a great team- even if I'm not thrilled about the game itself.
-The hints are useless 90% of the time. They either do nothing, or they just completely solve the puzzle for you- there is no in between. Giving players the answers is not ""a hint.""
-The hints just solving the puzzle for you is extra frustrating because the puzzles give you no nods or hints as to what the goal of the puzzle is- there's several puzzles you solve and go ""How the f*** was I supposed to know that was the goal?"" It would be great if there were ACTUAL small hints, for example: ""Size,"" ""Color,"" ""Lines."" Not enough to just give you the answer like the hints do, but enough to give you a slight direction to figure out what the hell you're supposed to be doing with the stuff in front of you. So its either you figure it out completely alone, or you have the puzzle solved for you with their ""hints""- there's no gray area. 

Overall, this is a great first step for what I feel is a fantastic indie dev team, and while A Little to the Left was not what I wanted it to be, I will definitely be keeping an eye out for future titles.",1689605158,1689605158,False,7,1,0.559310495853424072,0,True,False,False

If the premise appeals to you AFTER you read the negative reviews, get it. Some of the sounds are satifying, the art is cute. It's visually appealing to me and sprinkled within bouts of rage there are some satisfying puzzles.

I did not enjoy playing this partially due to my own bias and partially due to the game itself. I was searching for something that gave me a Unpacking feel and it didn't deliver. It felt more like a mobile game, I half expected ads between puzzles. I projected expectations of a hinted story, of a throughline, of a leisurely fun experience which is not their fault and why I'd prefer to just give it a ""meh"" rating.

What I hated about it however is the puzzles themselves. 90% of them were garbage to me.
Sometimes they were so easy and straight forward I felt irritated by the fact I spent $20 on the game while other puzzles were such a leap up in 'difficulty' I would try every dumb option first expecting more dumb baby puzzles and eventually get so annoyed I'd check the hints and realise it was something I would have tried if I wasn't used to just stacking things by size. The erratic nature of what solved a puzzle took me out of thinking for myself - I would try to think about what they would want from me instead, fail, and then have to check the hints. 

And then the hints were never hints - they were the full solutions. Where is the fun in that? Where is the puzzle?? Add in the fact that sometimes the solutions were arbitrary - like I found a way to fit things in perfectly but it was wrong and I'd have to fix it to their solution given but there was no reason for it. The cutlery drawer infuriated me because the little spatula going with the big one, where it fit, made sense and the solution they gave made the pieces overlap so it isn't fitting what on earth.. lol I just really am not having a good time with this. I'm annoyed, which was the opposite of my intention going in.

I'm continuing to play for a bit longer, by god I'll get my money's worth, but I just finished a puzzle where my answer was theirs and yet it won't mark it as correct to move on. I have posted a side by side of my answer and the solution online and no one can figure out what is wrong BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SAME. 

EDIT IN - A few minutes later there was a puzzle where the answer was to just place leaves and such symmetrically and there are infinite answers but only one is their 'correct' way. There's no pattern to it or anything, it's just trying to guess how they in specific laid it out. It's not a puzzle, it's a guessing game. This game is giving me rage like I have not experienced since childhood lol and I am uninstalling it.",1689436230,1689443831,False,2,0,0.533333301544189453,0,True,False,False

It's very frustrating.  There is one level where you move picture frames. I knew exactly where they wanted it moved to but for whatever reason you couldn't ""hold"" the frame long enough or once you got it close you would just let go and the picture would fall back to it's starting place. The game is supposed to be casual and relaxing. Instead it's frustrating.

All that said, I want to 100% the game, and the ""100 Daily Tidy's"" achievement is absolute hell. The entire concept of the daily puzzles is poorly implemented as it is just the same puzzle over and over, with variations in colour. The constellation puzzles should absolutely have different coloured stars for the ones you can move, and the plant puzzles are just annoying.

Overall, recommend. If you want to 100% know that you can change the date on your PC to mop up the daily achievements, but...it won't be fun.

[u]The Positives[/u]
+ Order and chaos collide in a puzzle game that involves a lot of tidying up.
+ A bright, colourful artstyle that, along with the music, makes for a relaxing experience.
+ While it includes optional hints, there's also the ability to outright skip any puzzles that don't appeal.
+ Several puzzles have more than one solution, an example is that along with ordering books by their height, they can also be ordered by colour—it's up to the player to try things out.

[u]The Negatives[/u]
- Completionists beware: a hundred days of daily tidies are required for achievements, and this is time consuming even when changing the date on your computer. Not necessarily a bad thing, but most likely more time will be spent doing this than the main game itself.
- Some of the puzzles aren't great, their solutions either hard to decipher or the positioning of objects a bit too fiddly.

The game has minimal story but throughout the five main chapters of the game players will be given hints to a cat in the background or within puzzles themselves that make common messes. This however is about the extent the game has as a story. 

The puzzles are for the most part fairly simple with a few levels each chapter having multiple solutions. It should be noted that for players who are expecting more of an organizational puzzle game that only makes up a small portion of the main games levels. There are actually more of those types of levels in the DLC.
Each chapter follows a common theme, with my personal favorite being the third as it had more of those aforementioned organizational puzzles. The final level was my least favorite but I'll touch on that more in a moment. The main overall puzzle make-up of the game consists of sorting by color, height, and object type. The puzzles themselves are not difficult, with the exception of a few that are a bit more of a brain teaser.

The final chapter however started to divert its puzzles from what the previous chapters had shown including: a time based puzzle for petting the cat, a Tetris like stacking puzzle, along with a few tasks that held the simplicity of the first couple of levels. The overall feel of the game completely changed for me and honestly, wasn't really what I was hoping for from the game. The first time I completed the game I remember thinking to myself ""That's it?"" The ending was so completely out of left field that I didn't really know how to feel about it. This would be my main complaint overall as the rest of the gameplay was actually quite enjoyable.

Then we get to the achievements, while the majority of them are not difficult, there are a few things to note for those who care about them. First you will need the DLC to 100% this game, and second a good almost fourth of the achievements have to do with a function called ""daily tidy"". This is a once every 24 hour daily puzzle players can do, and is based on a variety of smaller puzzles present in the game. The catch for achievement hunters is that you have to do 100 of these in order to get 100% in the game. In addition, 30 of those days you have to do consecutively. I'm all for achievements in a game, but I'm a firm believer that they should all be accessible within a standard playthrough. I shouldn't have to open up a game for a 5 minute puzzle long after finishing the game for achievements. You can mess with your local date and time to circumvent this, but that on its own just isn't worth the headache it would ultimately create.

Despite the couple of issues I have personally with the game, it is still a solid organizational puzzle game that completes what it set out to do. While the game does feature some ""make-it-all-fit"" puzzles they are only a small fraction of the full game and should not be what players expect the majority of gameplay to be. Those that are fine with this will likely find a cute, heartwarming, cozy puzzle game to spend a few hours to complete. Cat lovers/owners as well will more than likely resonate with quite a few of the cats interactions to prevent players from being able to tidy or clean in a few levels.",1688966072,1688966072,True,13,0,0.700725138187408447,0,True,False,False

the dlc is also very nice and simple. it didnt stray far from the original game and it really just felt like an add-on with more levels, just like you'd expect.

my only criticism would be the daily tidy. i think the 100-day tidies is an excessive achievement. especially since the daily tidies are simply remakes of a handful of puzzles from the campaign (maybe 10 or so puzzles).  i understand the concept of the daily tidies and i like the idea of ""doing something small each day,"" but it really just felt repetitive.  while the campaign is fresh and rewarding, the daily tidies are just monotonous and repetitive.

a tip for any fellow completionists: you can simply change the time on your computer to skip to the next days' tidies. (there's a great guide by D.A.R.K. if you look at the community forum's guides!)

as for anyone else who's read this far, i recommend time travelling to 12/27/2022 to try the five special holiday tidies! they were super fun and unique :) i hope they bring it back this year!

[*]Puzzles that rely on pure trial and error, especially the ones that require you to put objects into an incredibly specific spot with no width/height indication. Combine this with the puzzles that require you to do the same thing three times, and it's even worse.
[*]Bizarre 15-minute ""dream sequence"" ending that goes on far too long and feels like it's padding playtime than having a conclusion to your busy work. Feels like they ran out of ideas and decided to give us lunchbox Tetris instead.
[*]A cat that destroys your progress after you finish. Sure, it might simulate what a real cat is like, but there's a reason why modern puzzle games give you infinite time to think about your next action.
[*]A daily streak achievement: 365 days total and 30 days consecutively on launch. The reason why I am on my PC and not my mobile phone is because I don't want the game I'm playing to beg for my attention with known psychological hooks.
[*]The menus. You can't retry a level after beating it unless you've already done it before (only useful for 3 solution levels) and pressing the X to return locks you into this painfully slow scroll where you watch the screen slide horizontally across every level you've completed. Just allow me to skip it, please.

I feel more like I'm getting the answer instead of getting a hint. But I really like the variety in puzzle types, the various ways to solve the same level, and of course the cat. Once you 100% the main game itself there's not much to do besides replay, but I think the daily tidy is a really good addition. It would be cool if more levels were added in the future, but I love the game overall.

With the new update, I'm sad they took away the bigger daily tidy achievements. A big part of what motivated me to play everyday was the longer stretch goals and desire to get the harder achievements, and with one update I'm basically done already. I think that more, smaller intervals should have been added instead of nerfing the big achievements. Sure, it's a cozy game, but achievements are just that. An achievement, they don't have to be super easy.

I do appreciate them listening to other feedback and fixing things like the contrast between items in the symmetry levels.

DLC Update: It is not worth $6. The new types of puzzles are awesome but 4 out of the 25 new levels are...petting the cat once. I like a good petting the cat mechanic but if you're going to sell a DLC that takes about 45min to 100% you shouldn't count those 4 levels.

UPDATE FOR DLC: DLC has no reflex shenanigans. Not many mind benders but a great collection of chill sorting puzzles that leans into the game's unique selling points. (Also I went back for an achievement run and go AFK a lot, so don't judge game length off of my playtime. It's no where near that long.)

--

There's no ""aim for perfect"" with move or time limits or what have you, just getting the solution. (And sometimes double-clicking to confirm the solution because an item is slightly out-of-place.)
There's some Steam achievements that offer more challenge, but they're not reflected in the game.

Most other games with similar 'vibes' to this one tend to be story-based. A Little to the Left isn't story based - it's just a series homely or artsy scenes with patterns to identify. It's the cozy puzzle game equivalent of a daily crossword.

[b]A quick list of games you may also like:[/b] ""inbento"", ""Freshly Frosted"", ""Assemble With Care"", ""Fossil Corner"", ""Behind the Frame"", and, yes, ""Unpacking"".

I understand why people compare it to ""Unpacking"" -- it's a well-known game and both games aim for the  satisfaction of 'tidying', but the comparison sets false expectations. ""A Little To the Left"" chases the satisfaction of a ""ding!"" when you find a solution. Of noticing something could line-up and then making it so, regardless of function.
If you want to scratch the exact same itch as ""Unpacking"" then you may want to look at simulator titles like ""House Flipper"" where you're less trapped by the whims of Puzzle Game Logic(TM).

I find this game is at its best when you're tidying domestic scenes, and its worst when you're playing spot-the-difference symmetry. There's only a few of those levels and they're fortunately (for me) far out-weighed by levels based on categorisation and shape-matching. Those levels make up most of the game, with some inventive ones scattered in-between. 

The cat's a cute occasional nemesis. It appears too rarely for me to get particularly annoyed at it, and it's more like a puzzle game mini-boss. It DOES herald the only reaction-based portions of the game though. (Remember you can skip levels if this is a hurdle for you.)

The sound design overall is great. Visually, well, this game is known for its aesthetic after all. It's so pretty!!!!!

The DLC gets a little too annoying for me sometimes… You know, drawers and stuff. It's too much “open this, close that, now open that again” for me. But besides that, it's nice!! And also a good follow-up to the main game. Although maybe a little pricy by itself.

I did go back and forth in the main game several times to get closer to 100%, but it was nice. Even when I already knew the answers to every puzzle, I was enjoying the game.

Why do I think it's more on the negative side is because the game keeps bugging in certain puzzles, like where I have to choose the leaves that I want to get rid off and it doesn't let me choose the ones I want but other ones that I shouldn't get rid off it lets me choose. I also thought the game would be more like ""Unpacking"" which would have been more satisfying because I love organizing, but it has more puzzles than I expected and some of them make no sense. Like the cat Polaroids, which makes me frustrated and not leaving me with a satisfied feeling. Now, I do love puzzles but there are plenty of those and sometimes you just want to organize things without having to do it in real life lol.

This game has a ton of strengths: the art style and sound design are phenomenal, the cat is adorable, and there are certainly some very clever and satisfying puzzles. The issue lies in the fact that a majority of the puzzles are so straightforward, repeat an idea that's already been seen multiple times without new mechanics, or aren't even puzzles (petting the cat was cute once, but realizing that multiple of the levels being advertised were clicking on the cat took me aback). I really enjoyed it for the first half, but when I realized the game wasn't actually progressing in difficulty at all, I became more annoyed.

All of the promotions and advertisements that led me to purchase this game were puzzles relating to sorting drawers, cabinets, etc. From reading the reviews, it seems that was a common motivator- the satisfying puzzles where a pair of scissors fits in a perfect spot and whatnot. I loved these levels, and actually disagree with a lot of the reviews saying they were too nuanced or nonsensical. I felt that these levels perfectly built on the simple skills taught in the basic puzzles and combined them, so you found yourself wondering ""does this need to be in color order? Are there indents indicating a numerical order?"" These were the moments that felt like the price was justified and even if the game was 50% these levels, I would recommend it. However, it's not. The majority of the puzzles take less than a minute, some even less than 30 seconds, and often repeat the exact same principle over and over again. Shockingly, they get even simpler and more repetitive in the final chapters of the game, which caught me super off guard. This game has the perfect opportunity to build on concepts and combine them, increasing in difficult as it proceeds, and actually demonstrates that it's capable of it in the drawer levels. Instead, the ending feels like a tunnel of doing the same 3 puzzles over and over until the credits roll, and I hardly felt accomplished by the ending of the base game or DLC.

Perhaps the most overwhelming feeling I got from this game: If you removed the puzzles that repeated or were so straightforward you had to pause and reflect on how much money you spent on it, this game feels like a truly excellent mobile/tablet game that you would pay a few dollars for or get with a subscription and have a great time playing. I completed a single star on every level in the base game and DLC in under 4 hours (removing time spent with the game open while I stepped away, etc.), which is one of the poorer ratios cost to content I've seen from similar titles. The DLC has about the ratio of challenging to basic puzzles I would expect from the entire game.

I can't emphasize enough that this game oozes the love that was put into it- there was clearly so much passion and thought put into so many elements, and I really wanted to love it. Based on the DLC, it seems to be heading in the right direction, but I don't think I could justify spending any more money on additional levels.

Many of the puzzles require too much precision. You will have everything correct but one battery is a pixel out of place. Thre should be more allowance for this to cut down on frustration. There's also some levels where it's difficult to figure out where to start and all the pieces of the puzzle are in a pile. In actual puzzle building you can see all your pieces but not in this game which makes starting very difficult in places.

The other flaw is that the best levels in the game (drawer organizing) are few and far between. Considering I bought the game for those levels, I would do anything for a level pack of 20 or so of just drawer organizing. 

Overall I'd still recommend this game jsut go in knowing that the drawer levels are not that common and someof the puzzles you will solve but because there's a pixel off, you can't get the puzzle to ding and give you the star. You can skip the level but it's still frustrating.

I like puzzle games, I really do. 
I am a big fan of the Professor Layton games; I have played all of them. Those games are known for having a lot of really good puzzles and some bad ones that you cant possibly follow their logic. This game has some really good puzzles that make you feel really good for figuring them out, and a LOT of bad ones that are even worse than the worst puzzles from Professor Layton.
The repetitive nature of some of the puzzles only worsen when you have to solve them multiple times and even worse when you have to do them again and again and again with the daily puzzles that simply change the assets. 

I honestly cannot recommend this game because each time I played it, I just ended up frustrated by how it was.

If you like it, that is wonderful it just means I couldn’t enjoy something you did. And in the end that is more important than anything else. I just didn’t enjoy it.",1688238414,1688238461,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

if you've played the demo - yep, that's pretty much the game, just with more puzzles. it's fun. i suspect i will revisit the levels that have you organising things into obvious places, as those are the most satisfying and genuinely relaxing to me. 

however, some of the puzzles don't really have a good way to figure out what you're supposed to do without using the hints, which is frustrating (the opposite of what i wanted from this game). on top of that, sometimes the answers to the puzzles have incredibly specific placement, and i found myself having to adjust objects even when things visually looked to be lined up.

and with my hours played i have 100% completed the main levels. 

if you're a completionist, watch out - there are daily puzzles that expire after 24 hours, and an achievement for 365 of them. it's not going to be a quick completion. (this is no longer the case, thanks devs for lessening the requirements for some of the achievements :D)

Thought ah, yes, something to please my inner extra-perfection itch. Sadly it only had a few of these type puzzles. Left utterly disappointed. And of course the game is on a lil sale after i buy it full-price. 

[b] The game [/b] itself is very short. It starts with easy solutions, then moves into some-what more thinking puzzles and the end? what the hell is with the end? It felt like devs just ran out of ideas or were in a rush to get somewhere. Cause last chapter was just not it. Especially since the game itself is short, the end should've been more worked on, to get that rewarding feeling or something.

[b] DLC [/b] felt more like what i expected from this game. Yet again, short, but it filled the holes main game had.

[b] The price [/b] is way too much for such game. If you really want this game I suggest waiting for a sale. It is overpriced for what you getting. It should've been the price of DLC, though DLC was kind of worth those pennies comparing their game-DLC price ratio.

[b] Daily tidy [/b] is something else man. You would expect, since you have to do 100 of them for the achievement, it would be something different each day, to make you want to do them each day. Something cool, unique and thinking required to make you turn on you PC, launch the game only for the daily tidy and go on about your day, and do that all over again for 100 days. Wrong. The puzzles are the easiest and shortest ones taken out of the main game, changed a bit (different colors, objects) and repeats themselves every other day for 100 days. Luckily [spoiler] you can manipulate it by manually changing date on your PC, so that you don't have to wait and spare your time for those 100 days [/spoiler]

Like some other reviews have said, the control/cursor can be a little annoying sometimes. I only struggled with a handful of the puzzles, in terms of being completely stumped at what angle to solve it from, and usually if I step away and come back to the game later or another day, with fresh eyes, I was able to solve it.

It is easy to pick up and hard to put down, and by the end of it, you’ll be taking pride in the spaces you’ve cleaned.  

The premise is simple: every puzzle consists of a mess that needs to be cleaned.  The game does not explicitly describe how that must be accomplished, so the player must inductively determine what “clean” means.  However, I think you’ll find that most of the puzzles click quite easily, as everything is grounded in the cleaning of everyday things.  The patterns are intuitive and rewarding, and even if you don’t see it, the game allows you to obtain hints and/or skip any level.  It really is an accessible game that anyone and everyone can appreciate.

The one thing I wish was that the game was longer.  I want more, and the new DLC will rectify this problem, but it really does leave a mark on you.  The game does provide “Daily Tidies,” a randomly generated daily level, but it isn’t sufficient.  They are just randomizations of the levels in the main campaign, so they can become boring quickly.

Some believe that the game is too short for its price, but I would disagree.  Overall, even at full price, I wholeheartedly believe it is worth every dollar.  It may be short, but the experience, the challenge, it’s all unforgettable.  I would highly recommend this game, and I can’t wait for the DLC!",1687305490,1687305490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Constructive critiques for this game[/b]
- The cursor design and click detection are quite poor, especially when playing on a laptop track pad or the steam deck. I found myself getting a little frustrated with this.
- There is a point in the game where you are unable to skip a 'cutscene' in order to continue on. It isn't long, but this would have been a nice feature. I wasn't a fan of the time it took to move from one puzzle to the next.
- Many of the puzzles feel like pure 'filler' and are not challenging, nor interesting. For example there are countless 'symmetry' puzzles, where you're given some amount of shapes and need to create symmetry along a central Y axis.  This disappointed me, because there were many puzzles that felt quite cheeky/clever otherwise. 

At ~5 casual hours in length the game serves its purpose well, but I wouldn't classify it as [i]challenging[/i] or a 'must buy' puzzler. I appreciate the trance the game put me in, and there's a lot of love put into this.

And I was not only disappointed, I was actually pretty angry. I got this game on sale and I still think I paid too much.

The puzzles start off fun. They scratch that particular ""everything in its place"" itch, as so many others have said. But the game quickly devolves into, ""Wait, what the hell am I supposed to be doing?"" So many of the puzzles have just a single solution, and SO many of those solutions are so utterly convoluted and/or arbitrary that it became incredibly frustrating. And by the time I've clicked around enough to finally figure it out, the puzzle gets ripped away from me before I can properly observe/glean satisfaction from what I did. Worst of all was the Polaroid puzzle. An online walkthrough I looked at literally said, ""This is the solution. I don't know why."" What kind of game design is that? And what's more, THE CAT IS BARELY THERE. Do not promise an autistic lady a cat and then cheap out! >:(

I also agree with another user who commented that the end sequence went on for an absurd amount of time. Like...absurd absurd.

to specify on what achievements are making me upset, it is the ""Special Day,5,10,15"", Sqweeky Clean,Two Weeks Sweep, Calendar Collector(there is literally no way that im going to be able to remember to do it for 30 days straight, let alone a week or two.), all of the daily tidy achievements(you have to do it 100 days to get all of them and this makes me. very upset)

ive beat the game twice in under 8 hours. it does not feel like a lot of content and is made even more apparent by the fact that the daily tidies are just randomized rolls of the games levels

this heavily feels like it could've been a 3-5 mobile device game.

Small adventure games that only take a few hours to beat, relaxing puzzle games that don’t really have an ending, and anything in between are fun to enjoy and veg out on. It’s the same effect for me as binge-watching a show. A Little to the Left tries to be that. It has engaging puzzles and serotonin-squirting organization puzzles along with cute visuals, but it does come with issues.


The game’s puzzles start out fairly simple. There are around 75 puzzles in the main game with 365 daily puzzles. Puzzles start out with just straightening photos on a wall, putting cat toys in a basket, arranging a dinner set, aligning colored pencils in a certain order, stacking rugs, etc. These first dozen puzzles are relaxing and really give you a taste of what this game could be. Yes, I said could be as the game quickly ramps up the abstractness, and even with a full-on guide and accessible hint system in the game it still doesn’t make sense. The arrangement puzzles are the absolute worst. These are abstract shapes that don’t snap together but instead are arranged in a specific pattern. The patterns usually make no sense since the pieces are so far apart. These puzzles will frustrate most players and lead you into a false sense of relaxation and simple organization and stacking.

That’s not to say I don’t like a challenge. One puzzle has you sliding a mirror to the left and right and arranging the objects according to the reflection. Another has you stacking cat food cans in colored columns that match. These puzzles were enjoyable. My favorite was the organization puzzles. Put all the junk in the correct cubbies. That’s a lot of fun with the process of elimination. Sadly, there are only about four of those puzzles and I wanted more. The difficulty is all over the place, but it’s the artificial difficulty. The puzzles are just so obscure sometimes that most people may quit the game.


I also found the snapping system pretty broken. Sometimes you place an object in the right spot and it will snap into place and make a faint ding sound. However, abstract pattern puzzles require two symmetrical objects in the same spot in the scene before they will snap into place. This hinders progress as there are no tactile hints that you are making progress. There is a hint system that shows you the solution by erasing and uncovering. This was nice as I would try to just erase one part and still be able to solve the rest on my own. However, even the hints sometimes make zero sense.

Thankfully, you can still move on with the “Let It Be” system that skips the puzzle for you. There are some puzzles that have two or more solutions such as sorting from highest to shortest, then by color, and then by matching an image on the same object. While the first solution may seem easy to spot the additional solutions can be insanely abstract and obscure. I really tried to solve as many as I could on my own, but in the end, I solved maybe a quarter of the puzzles by myself. There were just too many that were frustrating or I felt I wasn’t making any progress. Some were just me overthinking the puzzle, but some were just poorly designed.


The visuals are cute. It has a pastel minimalistic look. Lots of colored pencils, charcoal, and watercolor art designs. The music is great and relaxing to listen to in the background it’s just too bad the game isn’t as relaxing. In the end, A Little to the Left is misleading in its first dozen puzzles and quickly ramps up the abstractness and obscurity too much requiring too many puzzles to be skipped. The most enjoyable ones are too few. This isn’t a bad game at all. There are fun puzzles peppered throughout the bad ones, and the overall cat aesthetic is enjoyable with great music.",1682237608,1682237608,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are walk-throughs online, but otherwise you just have to figure it all out on your own. There's no time limits, though. 

DEVS: Include some instruction options. Some puzzles were difficult to figure out what was needed. The spider web, the piles of paper, the broken crockery with loops on it, specifically.

I love to organize, and it seemed like a creative game!  It didn't take long for me to figure out what game this was and purchased it.  

The game itself has a cute little hand-drawn charm to it which is what also drew me in, the puzzles soon captivating me.  Each puzzle was unique with a few different repeats, and there were even a couple puzzles that had a few different ways of solving them!  I really enjoyed how much it got my brain to thinking about different matches.  Every chapter was also different too, like the food-themed one, or the workbench chapter.  There were always items I didn't think really belonged in a couple items, but to be honest, everyone has some sort of random junk in their drawers on occasion.  The Special events for the Daily Tidy was also a cute little addition and I loved how different those were!  It brought in some of the knowledge you gained from previous puzzles, but also brought in new ways of solving things.

The music was soothing, though it did get a tiny bit monotonous towards the end of my achievement hunting.  The only time I remember the music changing was towards the end.  Personally, I think it adds to the relaxing atmosphere and can't think of anything else that could be played while you go through the puzzles. 

I just wish that the hints for the puzzles were a little better about explaining what needed to be done.   Erasing the lines to reveal the hints were cute, but I struggled with learning what to do with some of the puzzles we were given.  However, this is a tiny issue in comparison to all the good things the game does.

I personally enjoyed this game a lot and definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys organizing or just needs to kill a little bit of time~  Definitely worth the purchase!",1681272652,1681272652,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Whilst it can somewhat scratch that aligned perfection OCD itch, remember this is a puzzle game with huge variety, so don't come in with that expectation. There actually are multiple solutions to a puzzle, with better solutions granting higher stars. This is both impressive and shocking, because it's very rare to have truly differentiating solutions. The visuals are aesthetic and pleasing to the eyes; you can play after finishing work, and replay levels to try figure out those other solutions. My only wish is that they add more content in the form of DLC. Although there are plentiful and sufficient number of puzzles, you can't but hope for more. There are daily puzzles, which are variations of existing ones, but that isn't exactly what I was looking for. This is an immensely satisfying game, and worth every penny.

The game itself is very fun and relaxing. The puzzles are short, but clever. The art style is cute and cosy. The game has literally everything going for it. Well, until you get to the levels where you need to sort things by colour, after which the puzzles become literally impossible due to the earlier mentioned art style. At least for a player like me.

My level of colourblindness isn't even all that intense, so I can only imagine how bad it is for someone with an even more sever case!

I get going for a soft muted pastel adjacent colour scheme, but if you're going to do that knowing players will sort things by colour, the very least you could do is add a colourblindness setting in the menu. That feature has become quite standard in gaming and would not be hard to implement. Either that, or make things that you sort by colour more distinct via hue, saturation, intensity etc.

Again, the levels are short and easy, so it's not a game ending road block. You can just brute force a solution eventually. That being said, it does really ruin what is supposed to be a fun and relaxing experience.

I know the game has been out for a little bit now, but I still hope this'll be addressed at some point in the future in some way.",1680583225,1680583225,False,96,8,0.795154213905334473,0,True,False,False

⭕ - Conclusion -:
This cute small organisation game is a lot of fun and whilst simple is extremely satisfying. The goal is to complete a series of puzzles which are different imperfect scenarios which need to be cleaned. The annoying cat really gets in the way and adds very little to the game but it does add an extra aspect to pay attention to. The game isn't easy to play over and over as the extra daily puzzles are identical to the main puzzles and don't offer anything extra. Overall though this is a good game and is worth the play through.",1679963088,1679963088,True,1,0,0.511095702648162842,0,True,False,False

This game will drive you absolutely bonkers and leave you screaming at the developers wondering why they think telepathy is part good part of game play! There's often no guidance on what to do...no clues...just a pile of mess to move into a different pile of mess.

The wiggling graphics is no joke. When you're trying to stare at a puzzle to find a solution, the graphics keep moving and jittering all over the place. I found an option to turn off ""shaking"", but apparently this didn't fix this graphics annoyance. (I still have no clue what ""shaking"" was removed when I turned it off).

The menus are equally annoying in this game. The cursor changes randomly from a 4 fingers out hand to a pointing finger. Clicking objects is a gamble on if you've hit the magical hitbox. Also, why do I have to click 3 times to get to the daily task? Why isn't this just one click? I clicked ""daily task""....so that's what I want. Why do I have to click 2 more times on pointless menus?

Poorly designed, strange interface, and puzzles that require mind-melding with the programmers. Skip this one...not worth it.

However, the game does have some flaws I want to acknowledge. Firstly, the further you get into the game, the more puzzles you will see that don't fit the motif of the others. There are a lot of puzzles that don't involve organizing, or in some cases there are puzzles that require you to deliberately un-organize something. 
There are also a lot of puzzles in which the solution is very un-intuitive. I found myself getting frustrated at a couple of them because, rather than being challenging in a way that makes you think, I could not fathom how I was supposed to figure something out on my own. There are a lot of puzzles that could benefit from a bit of an explanation. There is a hints system within the game, but I did not discover its existence until i was in the second to last chapter of the game. The hints are also somewhat inconsistent. Some of the hints completely gave away the solution, while others didn't tell me anything that wasn't immediately obvious. The puzzle I had the most trouble with was [spoiler] the one where you pet the cat. I ended up having to look this one up because I thought the cat's upset was based on where I pet it depending on color, and the hint was no help. I think the changing colors in this puzzle caused an added layer of confusion due to me thinking they were important to what I was doing. I also had trouble with the tupperware-stacking level. There didn't appear to be any reason as to why some combinations worked and some did not. [/spoiler] 
I only bring these issues up so the developers may keep them in mind for the future, not to dissuade anyone from playing this game. There is a lot more to enjoy about this game, and the issues weren't too prevalent and could mostly be overlooked.  
A great aspect of this game is that many levels have several solutions. This is a great way to accommodate different players ways of thinking, and provides a fun challenge for completitionists to see things from a new perspective. The only complication with this mechanic is that you can only view which levels have multiple solutions either by completing the level, or viewing it from the levels menu. The game usually goes from one level to the next, so most players likely won't visit the level method too often. There were a couple puzzles (for example, the box stacking level) where I was trying to accomplish two solutions at once because I did not realize they were separate solutions. I think the game could benefit by displaying the solution number to the player at the start of the level.
Overall, I think this is a great game a lot of people will enjoy. My criticisms come from a place of appreciation. I recommend giving this game a shot!",1679591909,1679591909,True,21,0,0.743518590927124023,0,True,False,False

One is that it felt like there was a tangible decline in the puzzle quality as the game went on.  There was an acceptable amount of redundancy, I would say - although you can only straighten photos or sort junk drawers so many times before the novelty wears off - but some of the puzzles were genuinely frustrating.  A few of them made no sense to me and required hints and I have no idea how anyone would have ever figured them out without them; there were also a few instances where I just clicked around randomly to find interactions with items that were not at all obvious and I don't feel like that's good design.  The frustrations I started to feel in the second half of the game took a lot away from the enjoyment I got out of the first half.

The levels where you have to organize stuff are the best in my opinion and there's not enough of them.

UX isn't the best either with an abundance of animations that block any player interaction, like when alt tabbing the game goes straight to the pause menu, which takes a couple of seconds of animation to do. Or when going to the level selection menu the game scrolls very slowly through every level you have passed and you cannot do anything until it finishes.

There's little to no story and no connection between the puzzles/chapters. There are some great ideas here, but I don't think the game exploited its full potential.

combine that with the fact that some puzzles have multiple ways to solve them (great) but no quick way of actually accesing the puzzle again (bad).
 every time you complete a level and want to go back to do the other pattern. you have to wait for the next puzzle to load. press escape. go to the level menu and wait for the slideshow animation where it checks off all the levels you completed since last time you were in the level select menu. wait for the level you completed to load solve it. then wait for the next level to load a second time.

many levels are exactly as promised, very relaxed
for these levels, it is extremely satisfying to find the solution, or solutions

many levels are extremely repetitive (like 3-4 levels where you arrange a series of objects to be symmetrical)
many levels take ages to finish (one of the paint can stack levels must be pixel perfect, super annoying and very hard to see)
for achievements:
several are still broken
they want you to play 30 straight days (doing dailies)
they want you to play 90 different dailies

There is no text or dialogue during the levels, but the game still manages to tell an engaging story about the futillity of obsessive organising. The tone is lighthearted and whimsical, but as someone who personal experince with OCD, it actually hit me a little harder, than was perhaps intended.

The game is equal parts relaxing and stressfull, depending on wether you just finished a level or is trying to figure out what the game wants you to do. The challenge with playing a game with no text is, that you have to figure out what the developer wants you to do in every single level. There is no straight up moonlogic and the hint system is usually very helpful, but I did have to google one level to figure out how to do, what I was trying to do.

If you are really debating on buying the game and want to know if its worth it- its not worth 15 bucks, I will be honest. The game has nothing necessarily bad going for it, but don't let the 75+ levels fool you like it fooled me. In total, there are 80 actual levels you can do, and some have different solutions to them. Though I would say that some of the levels are wayyyy too easy, and some are way too hard. It goes from organizing 5 colored pencils in the order of a rainbow in 5 seconds, to hanging up different tools on a wall based on where the nails are which took me like 15 minutes to figure out. Its about 2-3 hours of gameplay. With little repeatability. 

The game can genuinely be more picky on how to organize things than you would think. I personally think it would be way better if you reorganized everything in the way you wanted, and then said you were finished with the level, and continue to the next. Then at the end it could show you all the before and afters, and you get that feeling of having cleaned or fixed the mess to your liking, and not having to do it the way the game wanted you to. Maybe like an alternate game mode like that, idk. 

The art style and sound are really really nice though, I am personally a huge fan of all the little noises it plays when you interact with all the different items on all the levels. I like the sound of satisfying noises so if you are the same then this game definitely is nice in that field. 

Also the daily tidy thing is nice, but it just chooses a random level for you to do, so you are just repeating a level you've already done if you beat the game. So they take like 5 seconds to do. 

I would say this game is much more like a 5/10 dollar game as is, but I do think the devs plan to add more levels in the future, which is cool. Game itself is fun though, and a good 75-80% of the levels are satisfying to complete.",1677464546,1677464546,True,1,0,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,False

A lot of the puzzles are fun to solve and figure out the rules, while others feel cheap. The fact that some puzzles have multiple solutions is really neat, but it feels like a punch in the gut that those extra solutions don't have any hints. And also that the hint for every puzzle is just… revealing the solution, rather than being an actual hint.

It also has the *worst* toggle-hold setting of any game I've ever played, where it seems to be the least-effort implementation. There are lots of points where your hold can be ""dropped"" while moving objects in certain ways, and for the ordinary hold setting this is fine since you need to let go and re-click to grab again, but the toggle-hold requires you to click twice. Or, in some cases, something that only requires a simple tap requires clicking twice. It made this game unnecessarily frustrating at times.

The game definitely overdoes achievements by giving achievements for using hints, for not using hints, for skipping levels, for not skipping levels. And some weird obscure achievements that just feel like filler. I know a lot of people don't really care for achievements, but I like using them as a form of completion, and this game really spits in the face of that.

And finally… the daily tidy is a neat feature until you realise that it's just randomly reskinned versions of existing levels. It would be fun if the daily tidy only used levels you've already completed, or if you could complete levels via the daily tidy, but that's not how it works. It would have been nice to see parity for this, but since it's just an extra feature, I won't hold it against the game. I've had *some* fun with it.

Overall… I would give this game an extremely positive review and a solid recommend if it weren't for the stuff I mentioned. Since steam forces a positive or negative review, I'll skew toward positive, but it's not nearly what I hoped for.",1677095456,1677095501,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The premise is light and arty and fun: you are tidying up and also there is a cat that sometimes messes up your tidying, so figure out the organization logic of each level and earn a bit of satisfaction from imposing order upon chaos. It's fairly polished little package of riddles, but it really depends on your opinions on cats and on the real life activity that this is a video game version of.

Basically, I think it suffers from too many issues to be all that fun. The basic interaction loop, of dragging a thing around and seeing what happens to it, behaves quite oddly sometimes, for instance refusing to grab a particular object or dragging it an inconsistent rate. The systems that detect when an element is close enough to solved to adjust it into place, are a little too eager to interfere. The riddles oscillate between too simple and irritatingly large but have a lot of trouble hitting the sweet spot. There's a theme of like, celebrating cats, I guess, that didn't really land for me. It kinda felt like cleaning up someone else's house while they talked about their cat, which might be your bag but it ain't mine.

I find this to be a disappointing game overall. Not because it didn't try its best, but because it demonstrated that its premise is just undeliverable. There's too much bespoke logic and assets and creativity that needs to go into each level of this game, for how quickly the player can breeze through it and how attentive the designer needs to be to possible player solutions. Both failure modes of the level design---the player finding an arrangement the designer didn't recognize as a solution, and the player accidentally falling into a solution that they didn't even notice---feel more bad than a success feels good, I think. And the daily puzzle mode serves campaign puzzles with some of the elements randomized, which for me is too similar to the campaign; the prospect of playing that every day for a hundred days, in order to get a little badge and a cheevo, is kind of insulting.",1676774045,1676774045,False,1,0,0.458397775888442993,0,True,False,False

The game has a good number of Steam achievements, providing decent replay value. But added replay value comes from the Tidy of the Day, which is a nice way to not have to engage the story, but still take on a quick puzzle.

At first it looks like a neat game, to please the OCD within, but as you proceed the limits of the game become painfully obvious. This game shares a lot of the problems, the puzzel-solving genre is known for (like there beeing only the answers, the game developers thought of).
(Which is a real problem in this game, as everybody prefers a different style of sorting things. (By god, I would not put things away like the developers would.))

Apart from this problem, the controls left me confused from time to time aswell. As realistic as they are, I'd just wish they were handled differntly. You are left to drag pieces around the screen, searching for the approved spot quite often. 
At other times your answers seem correct (even matching up with the ones in the hint), but you still won't get the pass, because of a can beeing (not even) an inch away from the place it should be. 

The ""leave it"" option is a way to combat this, but it always leaves a bitter taste in ones mouth, when used.

On the plus side the game perfectly balances chill and cozy with a little challenge on a few levels. Most of the levels are a breeze but highly satisfying and once in awhile they'll give you a little brain teaser.
If the game included more puzzles it would definitely be in the top tier of my cute, chill and ""kill-an-hour"" games so I'm crossing my fingers more will be added so I won't regret my purchase.

the positives: it looks cute. 

the negatives: I played 5 min of this the refunded. Why would this game ever be $14.99? It's like if they took House Flipper, cut all of the graphics out of it, and then just gave up puzzle variation. This should be an app game for $5.00 bucks, that would make sense. But $14.99 for what, 75+ puzzles of just organizing things? What in the hell is that? 

I'm sure this was truly relaxing for some people but oh my god to me it was just anxiety producing seeing these mismatched items and then putting them in ways that felt, clunky and bad. If I wanted to clean things, I'd pay 2.50 for a ticket back on the train and clean my room, why is this a game? At least in House Flipper you have like, a house to complete, so you can see how it's changing over time, and you get excited about the next power washer section, stuff like that. 

You know what this made me feel like? It made me feel like I was drinking boba with the tapioca at the bottom, and you have to get all the tapioca balls in the straw or you feel anxious. At least I do. But in this case you solve it, and then you just jump to getting more of a mess! There's no ""look at all these fixed things you did"" it's just, hey you are anxious about this messed up area, you put things either next to or onto things, then you get a star and then go to the next mess. Don't play this game. Please. And if you have ADHD, man I hope you can enjoy this, but this game at this price just made me reallly annoyed. If this was $5.00 this review would not have been as harsh.

It was frustrating trying to solve for some of the less obvious puzzle solutions, but felt rewarding when I was able to unlock all stars for a level with multiple solutions. 

I would definitely recommend this game if you enjoy puzzles, however if you are a master puzzle solver you may take less play through's then I did and may not feel you got you money's worth. I finished the main game in four days spread over a few weeks, with about an hour devoted to playing in the afternoon when I had time. I'm still hunting for some of the achievements from this game, which I enjoy the replay and that they give a new puzzle every day to complete towards some of those achievements. The cat theme to this game is subtle, and the cat itself only appears in a few levels, though is more so in the final chapter.
If you're not sure if you'd enjoy this game there are plenty of play through's online to watch, I personally love the art style and soft music, it's a fuzzy cozy no pressure game of puzzles, simple tidying and symmetry.",1676126428,1676126428,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

[h1] The bad [/h1]
The game is relatively short. It could've done with some more chapters. The daily levels also don't really bring new content to the table, but rather reuse the puzzles from the existing chapters.

The game has achievements which are very grindy, requiring completely new playthroughs and playing daily levels for a year (though you can speed this up by changing the date on your system).

1629520,132171102,76561198042218362,223,27,888,0,515,1697688721,"I hate to give this game a negative review--this is another case where I wish Steam had a ""meh"" button in addition to thumbs up/down.

When I heard about this game, I was very excited to play it. I've always been obsessive about organizing stuff, so it sounded perfect for me. But somehow...this just isn't quite it.

My number one issue with the game is actually the setting. It seems to take place in some Martha Stewart dreamscape: nothing but houseplants, seashells, pretty rocks, and household objects. Weirdly enough, there is basically zero overlap between the things I actually like to organize in real life and the things I get to organize in this game. There's no level where you re-indent all your code, or where you get to redo the cable management behind the TV, or where you have to guess what screw goes in what hole as you put a smartphone back together. So I really couldn't relate to the overall scenario that much.

Another issue is how boring most of the puzzles are. The solution to half the puzzles is just to sort by color. And if not that, then just sort by size, or make the shapes fit with each other. There are only a few really tricky puzzles that call for any lateral thinking at all. A handful of the levels don't even have a single, correct solution; you just have to [spoiler] make a freeform symmetrical arrangement out of some random stuff[/spoiler]. It's more of an color-acuity test than real puzzler.

I was also let down by the level of interactivity. You can click and drag to rearrange stuff on the screen--and that's it. You can't attach parts together, break things, fold things, turn parts over, etc. So most of the mechanical, kinesthetic joy that comes from disassembling or fixing stuff is lost. It especially stings in the tool-themed chapter; you get a screen full of bolts, nuts, and wrenches, but can you put the nuts on the bolts, maybe using the wrenches? Nope. They get organized in some sort of cafeteria tray, same as the seashells and paperclips from before.

I was also unimpressed with the audio. The music is very repetitive and not very good. There is one track with this one arpeggiated piano chord, and it just goes up the scale, down the scale, up the scale, down the scale...I had to put the game on mute when I came back to replay the levels for 100% completion. The sound effects for picking up and moving objects around are also much too loud; the effect is often pretty jarring. If you move stuff around too fast, it turns into some kind of extreme ASMR.

And there are some other careless details besides all that. For instance, many levels have more than one solution. After finding one solution, I always wanted to try to get the others (sometimes they are painfully obvious). But the game automatically boots you off to the next level, so you have to exit to the level select and pick out the level the hard way. Another example is the daily puzzles; I think they are automatically generated from maybe 5 or 10 possible templates. The solutions are the same every time, so after a couple repetitions you can solve them on sight. Not sure how this is supposed to retain my interest.

Still, there are a few things I liked about the game. The narrative with the cat is a cute way to tie the different chapters together, and there are a couple of memorable puzzles in the mix. The art style is consistent and fits with the rest of the game, and it's a nice, focused experience. I can't deny that it held my attention for long enough to finish the game and do some achievement-hunting (the devs promise that the broken ones will be fixed in the next update). I'm sure some people will like this game much more than I did.",1675493920,1675493920,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I think my one gripe with the game, outside of its length vs. cost, is the fact that the difficulty of the puzzles doesn't seem to progress in a logical sense. A lot of the earlier puzzles are easier ones, but you will occasionally run into one that is leagues harder than the previous few, and you will wonder where this difficulty came from. And yes, even though there are chapters, the puzzles within each chapter don't even follow a difficulty progression.

Let me make this quite (not) short with my personal opinion.
Positive: 
-a nice cozy games with different kind of levels - almost no level is the same or similar, many different things to do 
-Worth more than 3 hours of gameplay till you finished it and even then you can still play it again to try out different methods on how to play that level (the stars seem to indicate how many possible outcomes there are)
-it's a very cute game, I like the music as well - made with lots of love!

Negative imo:
-Some level are the kind of cozy I expected when I got the game and saw the demo last year summer or something - but some levels are just ""too crazy"". I like a good challenge and I like to think on how to do stuff, but some levels were just horrible. Even with hints I did not understand some of them. 
-I got very angry when I did not understand the logic behind some of the levels and even with hints could not ""play"" them. Trust me, I know that you can't do a game where everyone can do freely what they want in a gameplay like here, but for some levels I was just so frustrated to the point that I did not enjoy it anymore. 

So, I know that ""cozy"" games are probably not my kind of game, but I still like to think that one day there will be one cozy game that will make me really relaxed and cozy, but this was not it - sadly. 
It frustrated me so much, one time I literally could not take it anymore and was almost giving up on it, but then I decided that I will at least play it fully. Look at every level and see what the end of it brings me. The end - a whole 'nother story. Some levels were just too difficult for me to really relax. 

But please. Give this game a chance if you think that it will have a chance to make you cozy, because it is the perfect game for most people! :) Very well done (just nothing for me)",1674995588,1674995588,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In fact you can go through the whole game without solving everything and still get to the credits.

Pretends to be a chill sorting game. Which it is, for the first third (and in the demo), but then things switch up and it becomes an annoying puzzler, which requires far too much precision (that is me with mild sorting OCD speaking, it is not about the precision, but about the game system not recoginising correct solutions if they are not EXACTLY and UTTERLY PRECISELY executed as the game demands) and it even has stressful bits, in which you quickly have to dissuade the cat (which was cute in the first third) from knocking things over or quickly stop a plant from regrowing leaves. The latter was the final straw for me and I dropped the game at this point. 

TL, DR: I tried to love it, but it left me wanting in terms of relaxation and sorting satisfaction and instead wanted me to play a sometimes time-based puzzler.

__________________________________________________________________________

Answer to the devs:

Sure, I figured that at least the plant puzzle was not truly time based (I really don't see how the cat bit wasn't, because you had to dissuade it from effing up your sorting again and again), but I was done with the line of unobvious puzzles, because that was not why I bought the game in the first place and not why I wanted to play it. 
Because, and the point remains standing, this game was advertised as a chill sorting game. Which. 
It. 
Is. 
Not. 
It is a puzzler primarily, because the sorting goes out the window after the first third, as I wrote.

Great that you work on the precision bit, I bet it will make a lot of other ppl happy!
However, again, that does not change the fact that this game is not what it seems and the demo did not show what the majority of the game would be.

So, I suggest you stop picking out the things I said that might not have been a 100% accurate and face the fact that you released a product that differs greatly from advertisement and demo. 
Puzzler =/= sorting game.

I would have loved to have either seen more puzzles or a lower price for the game as it is now. While i love the quality it does seen steep when you can complete all the levels in a couple of hours.
I do really appreciate the personal touches that the creators put into the game along the way, their love for their animals gave such a light to this already cute game and i have no regrets purchasing.

Some levels are intuitive enough that they make sense, but somewhere between ""half"" and ""most"" of the puzzles don't give any indication at all of what you're supposed to do. For example, one level gives you a handful of pencils of varying lengths. The natural assumption is that you are supposed to arrange them in order based on their length, which is true, but what the game gives you NO indication of AT ALL is that you're supposed to [spoiler]arrange them in very specific spots on the single-color background[/spoiler]. 

Another example is a level where it gives you a bunch of envelopes with some stamps. Again, with NO indication of what you're supposed to do, you have to just click around the guess, Turns out, you [spoiler]are supposed to make the stamps on the envelopes into patterns by placing the stamps[/spoiler]. 

Another level has you stack papers on top of each other, but then a very similar appearing level wants you arrange them on (invisible) hot spots around the background. There's nothing distinguishing those mechanics.

So this game is basically just ""click around randomly until you find the invisible hot spots."" It seems like they are supposed to be puzzles for you to figure out, but forgot to include the actual puzzle.

The ""hint"" system gives you the full answer (at least on the levels I used it on), which is definitely not a reasonable thing for a game like this that gives no indication of what you're supposed to do.

I don't generally bash on games where it's obvious I'm not the target audience, because I don't think that's really fair. In this case though, I *am* the target audience, as far as I can tell, and enjoyed the few levels that made sense.  2/10, A for effort. If the UI were fixed to provide indicators for where the invisible hot spots are, or even indicators about what each puzzle is supposed to be, maybe a riddle or something, the game could be so much better.",1673924929,1673924929,False,4,0,0.55145716667175293,0,True,False,False

For some puzzles I just found myself saying ""I don't know what you want!"" In the developers effort to create something 'satisfying,' they actually create something obtuse, specific, and 'incorrectly ordered' that grates on your sense of order and satisfaction like sandpaper. Plus the 'hint' button, is literally just the answer. I hate to break out this card but other people are too so I want to clear something up.

Repeat ad-nauseum.  Which is a shame, because the visuals are lovely and I LOVE knolling and organizing.  After the third ""put these pencils in order"" level I got bored enough to quit.

You also cannot re-map key bindings.  From what I played you likely won't have to use the keyboard, but there was one level that my mouse just couldn't get something to move far enough to snap-to and chime so I had to use WASD to complete the level.  I am not a WASD keymap player for accessibility reasons.  So this game is potentially not accessible to some players if they need to use the keyboard and don't or can't use WASD.

This review comes after full ""story"" completion, and most solution variation completed for those interested in time to complete!

I can't say how much I appreciate that the game had little nudges towards the ""correct"" answer for the puzzles, and that there are *multiple* ways to complete the puzzles. Most of the levels are variations on a theme, and after completing simple versions early on, the later puzzles become less cryptic for what needs to be accomplished.

The aesthetics of the game were super satisfying to work within, and the hints work well within this little world the developers created. You can reveal only as much as you need while still needing to do a little leg work to determine what the hint is referring to.

I played bits of this on controller and keyboard, and both work great. The controller has lock on for certain puzzles where things get kinda small to grab. Things that require precision placement are also nudged into place where necessary, and certain objects will reorient themselves to give you a tiny hint of where they might need to be placed.

Overall, a quick little game to pick up that's peaceful with bits of humor! There's also ""daily tidies"" that you can come back to for little puzzles every day.",1672350241,1672350241,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

First of all, this is not how ""Full controller support"" should work. Can you imagine mapping mouse cursor directly to controller joystick movement? Does this seems absurd to you? Well, developers saw this as a good idea and implemented it just like this.
""Puzzles"" are rather boring and sometimes counter-intuitive. In first color crayons puzzle I sorted them in opposite direction and guess what? IT DOESN'T COUNT.

The first few levels were easy, but satisfying. Then the game quickly devolved into really confusing levels where it's not clear at all what you're supposed to be doing. For example, there's a level with a calendar and a pack of stickers with flowers, dots, squiggles, etc. Some stickers have already been placed on the calendar, so you need to figure out which days you should put the rest of them on. After a while of not being able to figure it out, I went to the forum, and someone said that you just have to put a sticker every 9 days. Why? I don't understand. What appointment does anyone have that is every 9 days?? How is the player meant to figure that out???

It was sold to me as a really satisfying and zen game about organising things. A part of it is, and those parts are fantastic. The art is simple and cute. It has all the right parts to make it a great game. 

But it isn't. 

To much of the game is increasingly difficult and obscure solutions to, what should be, simple puzzles. 
Do the developers expect me to sit on those leaf levels (especially the second one) and trial and error the solution? Without giving to much away for people that do what to try this game. This ""puzzle"" involves selecting the right items out of everything or it resets. Normal games have visual indicators or patters to assist this. This game said no to that. 
Why are those blank screen and random item ""puzzles"" like that? I thought it might just be like a timed thing where you can move on after playing with the items for a certain amount of time, or that there was some sort of picture to build. No. There is a picture to build...a hyper specific picture...with no reference to it...and everything has to be specifically placed or you won't get the level. 
Honestly, I never thought a game about organising would need a walk-through, but this game does. It is also super sad to see the walk-through's with explanations for the solutions to the ""puzzles"" being ""I have no idea why this is the solution, it just is."" 
I think that is the problem. The ""puzzles""exist to stump you and be different. Not to scratch the itch that organising brings. 

The game does have hints though....and by hints....I mean they give you the answer. I'm assuming because even they know that some solutions are too stupid and complex for anyone to spend time figuring out. 

To be honest, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone that wants to have a relaxing time. There are better games out there.",1671942147,1671942147,False,10,0,0.600091218948364258,0,True,False,False

It took a little getting used to, learning what is and isn't an acceptable approach to organisation within the game's world, but once you've learned it, you'll probably be able to power through the game and return to the puzzles that didn't click on another day (thank you for the 'let it be' feature)!

There are other levels where you think you can just sort items into an aesthetically pleasing design (nature levels) and dozens of ways you could do it with the space you're given.  But no there's a very very specific way to solve the level and the game will not accept anything else.  The only way to know is to go to the level's hint through the menu.  I'm really not a fan of having to ""cheat"" in order to get through levels just because I can't figure out what the game is trying to get me to do.  

A few other reviews pointed out that items will snap to a grid but they don't really do that.  The hit box for it must be really small or just not sensitive enough. I found I was putting things in the same spot with nothing happening unit the 10th time I put it there or placed another object near it to kind of push it in.  

This was supposed to be relaxing and I'm honestly way more stressed out than I would be playing most other games.  I would not recommend this to anyone, and I can't see myself playing this again, which is a shame considering how much it cost.  I just wanted a casual and calming game to play, but I feel like I've wasted 2 hours and money just to feel tense.",1669627500,1669627500,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I wanted to like this game. I did. And I tried. I [i]love[/i] puzzle games, and this was pitched to me as a """"relaxing"""" puzzle/organisational game. 

It's not relaxing. It's really, really not relaxing. In fact, it's frustrating. So frustrating in fact that I could feel my brain splitting in half as I desperately tried to figure out what the game wanted me to do on some stages. [spoiler] ""Oh, the spoons have to go in the little section with ever so slightly rounded corners? oh NEATO—"" [/spoiler]

So, perhaps I went into it with the wrong expectations, thus ruining it for myself forever. Maybe it won't be the same for you.

However, I feel like even if I had been told, ""hey, this is a puzzle game,"" I'd still feel a bit irked. The cursor feels janky/rigid no matter how I change the settings (and no other games are giving me this trouble). The cat in this game, somehow, is the first cat in a video game that [i]I feel myself hating.[/i] It's not enjoyable seeing hard work get destroyed by its malicious l'il paws.

Also there is a cat, which is a plus. There are basically no instructions and some puzzles might get a bit frustrating if you don't get them at first - there is a hint system in case you get stuck though.

I like that the developers tried something different and I'd gladly pay the same price again even after knowing that it's not that long, it's time and money well spent.

There are occasional puzzles that seem a bit convoluted. One or two I didn't understand even after using the ""hint"" mechanic to solve it. Most are pretty intuitive to solve without a hint, or by just uncovering one tiny portion of the hint screen to give you a place to start. 
I also like how there are visual and auditory clues when you get something right or wrong. Things snap into place and a tiny chime sounds when you get it right, for many puzzles. (Things can also snap or settle into the wrong place, but it doesn't chime in this case.) If something is in the wrong spot, it will often skew off-kilter so you  know it doesn't go there. 
Overall, I find this puzzle game to be calming and very enjoyable and I look forward to continuing. I am about to finish chapter 3 after just shy of 4 hours, and have unlocked 10/51 achievements. I am not specifically seeking achievements yet, but likely will go back for any I missed. I noticed you can go back and replay previous puzzles which I was grateful for because I accidentally skipped one I was having a tough time with, when I was trying to figure out if I had to save. (Note: the game seems to auto-save your progress.) 
Daily puzzles are a total mystery to me. Have not been able to solve one.

Second edit: About 8.5 hours to get all solutions to all puzzles. Thank you to the reviewer who mentioned the ""stars"" as I hadn't even noticed them.

[b] 5/5 ★★★★★ [/b]
  
[b] This game is a great example of superb game design. [/b]
[u] A Little to the Left [/u] really takes advantage of the feeling of satisfaction you get from using your intuition and being right. It is such a good feeling, and one that you will get often as you figure out each puzzle's clever solution(s).
Chapters are organized with their own themes, which helps making them feel distinct and resonate with a broader range of players through their own life experiences.

The artistic direction is impeccable, both through the game's minimalist and clean visuals, as well as through its very cozy soundtrack, both of which bring out emotions and meaning throughout the playthrough.

The difficulty of the puzzles does not get in the way of enjoyment or progression, as the player always has the option to ""Let it be"", i.e. to leave the puzzle as it is and go to the next one. However, the fact that some puzzles have multiple solutions, some harder than others, as well as ""secret"" solutions in the form of achievements, proves truly useful in making the experience last a little bit longer.

If I had to criticize one thing, it would be the multiple steam Achievements that are either not unlocking properly and/or unobtainable at realease, but I noticed some changes have already been made in that regard, and hopefully all achievements will work as intended soon.

[u] A Little to the Left [/u] is a genuinely good game, and one that I would strongly recommend to anyone looking for a casual, wholesome, and satisfying experience. 

P.S. the end credits were successful in making me and several other players on streams feel emotional, and this speaks volumes about the design choices and the genuine part of themselves that the developers put into the game through this very humanizing moment.

For starters, I personally find the music and sound effects to have a lot of sudden high tones which are not relaxing in the slightest.

[h1] Controls [/h1]
The controls are god awful. My resolution is set correctly yet it makes me play with a giant cursor and some of the puzzles were resulting in my mouse going off screen and my movement snapped back to what it was before. I tried playing with a controller and it was the most frustrating experience ever, there are too many things to move around from and it's too clunky.

[h1] Puzzles[/h1]
The puzzles were cute and I liked the idea, but in a game where some of them have multiple solutions, why not ask us if we want to try again for the other solutions? That just didn't make any sense to me and the menus feel so clunky that going back to do that is a pain. Also some of the solutions are just weird depending on how your brain works. There's one set with some books and they're SUPPOSED to start with ONE big one, the smallest going in the middle, and back up to a big one. I personally did it in decreasing size order because that's how I'd personally want to organize something like that. And playing on a controller and having to move all those books around? No. I personally feel like a game about moving things to organize them should give you a little bit more freedom, or I guess have more solutions stored. Everyone arranges things differently and being stuck in a box with this makes it quite annoying. Even Unpacking has a mode that you can freely place things and while that wouldn't translate exactly here, I think having one solution for most of those puzzles is a mistake and makes it less appealing to people who obsess over organization.

Let's not beat around the bush, this game specifically appeals to people with various mental illnesses and the way they set it up doesn't work well with those mental illnesses. I'm sure for some people this is great but if you have issues letting go of control or need things to be a certain way?

I paid $15 for this game. For that price, I would have expected hundreds of levels, and that isn't the case.

I would definitely like to see this game be updated with more levels.

Wait for it to go on sale. The only reason I have 8 hours on it is because I let it sit up on my computer for a while; I could have realistically finished this in 1.5-2hrs. And, admittedly, some sequences feel a little bit [i]too[/i] drawn out, even for a slow, relaxing game like this.

For me, it's at its best when it's a puzzle game - the levels with multiple solutions in particle encourage some creative thinking. The levels about organising a large collection of objects are satisfying, too.

Where it falls down is levels which have no puzzle whatsoever (the constellations level and snowflake level in particular come to mind). These levels go from feeling like a puzzle based on a chore to being a chore. In addition, The Daily Tidy (alongside being the bane of all completionists and achievement hunters) pretty quickly became tedious for me. Daily Tidies based on good puzzles don't work (because you know the answer), but if they're based on non-puzzles (the last two Daily Tidies were constellations and snowflakes) then they're even more tedious than the original.

Speaking of non-puzzles, some levels simply involve arranging a bunch of stuff so there's symmetry, but the actual pattern you choose doesn't matter as long as the symmetry is there. This wasn't clear to me, and I think I only realised this was the case after completing all such puzzles with hints.

In addition, there's a few places where inputs seem finicky. You have the right solution, but you placed something slightly wrong or turned something a few degrees too much and the game doesn't acknowledge the solution (I think my biggest problem with this was on the alternative solution to the tomato cans). That said, this is rare.

As a final complaint, for a game where the coolest part is replaying levels with multiple solutions, the game always forces you onto the next level when you complete a puzzle for the first time. So if you want to replay it while it's still fresh in your head, you have to exit to the menu and reload the level.

Overall, this game is still excellent, I just wish they'd focused the experience more around the 3 Star levels and levels involving mass-tidying. Still a great game, highly recommend it while on sale.",1668475698,1668475698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The hint system is very good, with the option to uncover the solution as much or as little as you like. I also appreciate the ""Let it be"" option, which lets you skip a level and come back to it later.

The satisfaction of solving a puzzle is quickly squashed by frustration when presented with objects or a puzzle layout that doesn't make sense no matter which angle you look at it from. It detracts from the clever mechanics of the puzzles that work.

Even after looking at the hint, which is just the solution, some objectives is still unclear. For example, Chapter 3 has a puzzle where you organize rocks and other random items. I had to look at the solution and I still had no idea what the criteria was for organizing the objects. I studied the solution and found no patterns, symmetry, etc. I know that there has to be some rhyme or reason to it, but if someone can't look at the solution and see the idea with minimal effort, the puzzle is too vague.

Also, as mentioned earlier, the hints are the solution. Even if you only clear a section of the page, the fun of figuring out the rest of the puzzle is lost. Maybe a general nudge in the right direction would be more helpful, such as images of symmetry for puzzles where the object is making the image symmetrical. I do appreciate that the solution is available when you are absolutely stuck, but having a few steps before then would be better.

The star system is also confusing as most people would assume the number of stars you have accumulated  would mean your completion score. In actuality, the stars represent the number of solutions you have found and the number possible. A lot of people who are drawn towards this type of game would like to achieve full completion and this vague star system is very frustrating until you learn what it really means.

Playing the demo of the game, the puzzles were easy and fun. It applied towards the actual game, yet I was frustrated a bit with the other puzzles that weren't part of the demo.

I really suggest on having a helper or pattern to follow for the ( spoilers ) the leave cutting and item bundle matching segment where we needed to peek at the hint/answer to know what to do. You need to be very observant in the game to solve other segments, that's why perhaps instead of having the hint/cheat sheet in the menu. It could be just a helpful tip that will pop out for the player to know what to do instead for them to see the full answer on the spot.

I highly suggest the game if you liked unpacking, the way you organize and solve each round at the same time felt fulfilling much more the ending was the nicest way to end the game.

The best parts of the game feel like a more structured version of ""Unpacking"", with lots of cute little scenes to organize in an intuitive or a logical way. It's relaxing and scratches a very particular itch.

Then there's the rest of the game. A good number of the puzzle completely lacks the ""intuitive"" and ""logical"" parts of the above statement. The problem is that these puzzles insist on a ""right"" answer, even when there is no discernible reason for that right answer. For example: arrange a bunch of random seashells in a *very* specific way, with no way of knowing what the right way is. These puzzles are frustrating and demoralizing, and they kill the relaxing vibe of the game.
Hints might have softened the blow, but the ""hint"" system in the game just immediately tells you the ""right"" answer, removing any sense of accomplishment as soon as its used.

And then after buying it on release day, I was like ""Oh wait, this is like a million other puzzle games.""
Put the leaves color order. Make the spoons go smallest to largest. Turn the clock until a shadow in the background matches.
I've played that game. I've played that game a hundred times. Any game under ""puzzle, casual, relaxing, cute"" is going to be this exact game.

Genuinely, my playtime is as long as it is for this exact issue. Specifically from the postcard puzzle, where I had the correct answer for 30 minutes and it just wasn't ""clicking"" into place.

i was obsessed with the demo, and was excited for the full game so i could replay levels, but since the levels dont randomize, its the same exact scene/placements every time, theres no replayability and levels get old after just 1 or 2 plays. it sounds dumb but i was excited for the taking the stickers off the fruit one, but the stickers dont randomize where theyre located, so its just pulling the same sticker from the same spot over and over :( i love love love the concept AND execution, but i feel like adding some sort of 'endless mode' of things like sorting/cleaning/pulling stickers/etc would be absolutely perfect. this game has a lot of potential in terms of replayability if only a few things about the game would change imo. 

i do actually recommend the game, but not at the $15 it is now. i was initially hesitant for the full game based on the price knowing its a small game and im still trying to convince myself that it was worth it to spend that much. i love the game, dont get me wrong, but with only abt 3 hours of gameplay and no replayability, $15 unfortunately just doesnt feel right. a lot of the puzzles are just repeat ideas with different items (such as just making some shells/leaves/etc symmetrical) and get really monotonous.

It can be frustrating in quite a few of the puzzles, but it’s an overall enjoyable and very relaxing experience! [/quote]

“A little to the left” is both a phrase that I hear way too often when helping my mom change furniture around in her house, which she does at least once every couple of months, and the name of an [b]incredibly charming little puzzle game made by a two person team called Max Inferno.[/b]

I know I joked about the whole furniture thing, but honestly, I’m pretty sure that precise scenario is where the developer got the name of the game from. You see, [b]the game is all about organizing things,[/b] with the very first level being all about fixing a picture that needs to be tilted just a little to the left. I see what you did there, devs! Honestly, I love the name of the game. It fits.

But what DOES it fit into, exactly? What is the full package? Well, [b]A little to the left is a puzzle game that consists mostly of organizing things.[/b] You have a level select screen with over 75 quick levels that give you a variety of objects that you need to organize within whatever frame the level provides you with. If you get a bunch of books side by side, for example, you’ll know you’ll probably have to shift the books around to organize them in a way that makes sense, be it by size, cover design, whatever. On another level, you’re given stickers to apply to a calendar, or stamps to apply to letters. Whatever the case, [b]the levels usually have a pattern, something to nudge you in the right direction, and it’s up to you to find out what you have to do. But do take note of the fact I said usually, because unfortunately, it’s not always like this.[/b]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2886559479

[b]See, while quite a few of the puzzles are very intuitive, some of them… aren’t.[/b] The worst were the ones that just gave me an empty space and a bunch of objects. In those, you’re supposed to arrange the objects in the right way, except as far as I can tell, there’s only one way to find out the correct arrangement, and that’s via trial and error. [b]And that’s not just me saying, quite a few of the reviews are in the same boat as me, which is the I-sometimes-find-it-hard-to-tell-what-goes-where boat.[/b] The game does try to alleviate this by having a kind of a snap effect to an object when you put it in the right place, along with a DING sound that plays, but for me, that was simply too inconsistent to rely on.

[b]Thankfully, though, the game has a handy hint feature, which I unashamedly used for all the levels I found unintuitive.[/b] Well, I say hint because that’s the name in the game, but the truth is the hint is actually the entire answer of the puzzle, but it’s displayed in a way that can be a hint. It’s quite brilliant, really. Let me explain. The answer is basically written in a notebook, but scribbled over. You can get an eraser and erase all the scribbles, which reveal the puzzle’s answer. However, if you only want a hint, you can choose to erase just part of the scribbles, and reveal just a bit of the answer. This way, the player has full control over how much help they want, and I find that to be pretty cool.

[b]The game also has multiple solutions for some puzzles, which are shown via a star system.[/b] Basically, you complete a puzzle and you get a star. However, if you complete a puzzle and you see there are two or more stars to get, that means there is another solution to your level. Just like with the puzzles, the solutions can also be unintuitive sometimes. However, in this case, not even the hint will help you, as the hint only shows you the answer to one of the solutions. The rest is on you. [b]While I do enjoy the star system that easily shows you the number of solutions a puzzle has, the game doesn’t actually explain this anywhere. It doesn’t really explain much of anything at all, in fact.[/b] In a game as simple as this, in which you play by clicking and dragging your mouse, that’s mostly okay, but this fact can generate some confusion in some areas, such as the stars. I’ve seen players for example who thought these stars were ratings, and that they were being too slow/doing something wrong.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2886559204

[b]In terms of story, there isn’t really one, and that’s okay. This is a very casual puzzle experience made especially for people who are really into organizing their spaces.[/b] If you finish all the content of this game and want more, fret not: [b]the game does have a daily puzzle system,[/b] so at least once a day you can hop back in and do that. In this vein, the game is very relaxing. [b]The graphics are adorable and very cozy, with a soundtrack that feels at times upbeat and at times like a warm hug.[/b] The game is very good at making you feel like your worries are melting away… if you don’t get frustrated at some of the puzzles.

[b]While I did enjoy my time with A Little to the Left, I do believe this game isn’t going to be for everyone.[/b] For me, the puzzles varied wildly in quality, with the best ones being very intuitive and a nice challenge in figuring out how to accomplish your objective, and the worst ones being the ones in which you have no idea nor clue what you’re even meant to do, or, even worse, the empty space ones in which you know what you have to do but have no way to tell which object goes where in the game’s preferred organization. Thankfully, I found more intuitive puzzles than I found the other type, but there were still many more of the latter than I think should have been.

If you think you’re okay with this caveat I mentioned, then you’ll probably find this game very relaxing, much in the vein of Unpacking, if you played that. But if you tend to get frustrated when a game wants a different solution than your perfectly valid one, or upon feeling that a puzzle might be unfair… then it might be best for you to steer clear of this title. For me, I had a good time, even with the frustration. Certainly commendable work, especially for a 2 person team. If you do pick up the game, I do hope you enjoy it. And if you want to talk about the game, I’m always down to chat! You can find me just a little to your left. … I’m so sorry. I’m actually probably thousands of kilometers away but I really wanted to make the joke.

However, I wasn't expecting to encounter the idea that there are a bunch of wrong ways to organize things in this game as well. When there's a stack of books of the same height, I thought color and size was an appropriate way to organize. Apparently, you have to make the colors link in a way it wants as well. This carried on, and various other little things.

Frustratingly, there's no words or anything that would tell you how the game works. Nothing that says ""sometimes there is more than one way to organize this one"" or ""this one only has ONE correct way, despite how many ways you can think of.""

Maybe if you aren't going to be bothered by every organization idea you try being wrong, then this would work for you. For me, some of them are quite the stretch and the lack of information + possible time limit affecting my star score? It's confusing, if nothing else.

However, I just can't say the same about the puzzle design. I understand it is first and foremost, a puzzle game where you have to find the ""catch"". But it advertises itself as a relaxing organisational experience and it's not really that. Some puzzles only have one set answer even if you can craft many different ways to organise the scene.

I found myself frustrated as I can't figure out why my answer wasn't correct, after a few times of feeling this way I just couldn't keep playing. The real answers are too abstract and sometimes feel arbitrary. Sometimes I would just stumble upon these ""real answers"" randomly because of the items snapping into place and playing an audio cue.

I think a way that could make this game feel better to play is allow more and looser answers to all puzzles. Let the players experiment and find all the possible solutions. When I'm done with a level, instead of moving me forward, let me retry and fiddle around and see what different and abstract answers I can make up.

The ""let it be"" option is a good design choice but feels unsatisfying to click when I've made my own answer.

I feel like the whole time I'm cleaning someone else's house with their rules instead of my own spaces which makes the game feel tedious unintentionally.

Many of the puzzles are fun and give you a sense of accomplishment when solved. Others are IMPOSSIBLE to figure out without hints (thank goodness for the 'ding' and items snapping to the grid as self-corrects), making the game more frustrating than fun. I stumbled my way to more than one solution before I even knew there were actual hints available in the pause menu. Even then, I didn't always understand what I did to get the puzzle right. I suspect many of you are smarter and far more patient than I am, so your mileage may vary.

As other players wrote, the demo doesn't set the right expectations for the the difficulty of the full game.
