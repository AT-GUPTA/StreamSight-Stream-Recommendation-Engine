Played a few more hours. still just as frustrating.

When checked on their games, you ll only see a broken early access cowboy woo game. Gameplay is as others stated half done (i would even say they just copy pasted from other indie survivor games) and utterly meta progression reliant (which are of course %1-%5 increases that you can buy between the runs, but note that runs usually take between 15-50 minutes). Besides horrendous difficulty and nothing to make you feel good about playing the game, they also force you to waste maybe 30 minutes to UNLOCK a weapon mod that you can use on the next run, you do this for almost EVERY weapon. 

Its almost made in a way to waste your time intentionally, the only reason i bought the game was because of the drg but i wish i didnt, maybe my perspective will change when devs actually do something and patch/fix the game up that was disgusting at launch, instead of streaming how they play the game for hours. Check every negative feedback if you must, but do not waste your money and time if they are valuable to you. I will change the review when they fix the game. (though yes im a drg addict so i will keep playing and ruining my mood)

edit: i wanted to try my chance to skip through meta ""proggression""  and found out its more like a meta slavery. upon using cheat engine to get minerals and credits to buy all upgrades... guess what, it could have taken me weeks to fullfill that, asking me 10k credits and 100 X mineral (which you barely get a few per run and buy rest with minimal credit reward). Geez man, the more i learn the more disgusting it gets, but i guess game is more enjoyable if you cheat your way through meta progression.

edit 2: i was severely mistaken, upgrades offered in meta prog are completely unrelevant, they are the same upgrades you could get in a few levels in one run. i thought i'd have fun after maxxing every stat but its just disappointment , you can barely see any difference between no meta upgrades versus maxxed meta upgrades. this game is in a more severe situation than i thought, i wont be playing it for a long while.

my final conclusion is that the game is very predatory, making it hard to know if its a good game in 2 hours of gameplay. currently trying to refund, this game is not even worth a single dollar.

You practically never feel strong enough to kill the swarm until you at the later levels. So you spend most of the run running away.

Difficulty scaling is uninspired, the bugs just have more health and do more damage (and there's more of them). You can't go to a higher hazard level without meta-progression, because you would just die to the littlest bullet-sponge bug. At the same time the same progression makes lover hazard levels trivial. So your choices are to run away from bullet-sponges on higher hazards or breeze through lover ones after enough upgrades.

Some weapons are absolutely terrible and only become ""decent"" after the third overclock and even then they are outshone by non-upgraded non-terrible weapons.
Directional weapons are mostly bad. Minigun, Subata, etc can be useful, and even good after overclocks, because they have auto-aim in a limited arc. But Warthog just shoots ""forward"" and this ""forward"" is in no way the direction the character model is facing, but your last input direction, which makes it even harder to aim.
Beam weapons look like they were made for a game that should play 10 times slower. With terrible turn rate and even direct damage. The flamethrower is so bad, it can't kill the littlest bug before it bites you when you start the run.

The pacing is also wack. After running away and kiting swarms whole stage you have 30 seconds to get to the pod, often leaving piles of XP scattered around with no time to backtrack and pick it up. Stages often feel way too short.

Overall, it makes the game in its current state an unsatisfying slog. I'm ok with lack of content, but I want what's there to be at least enjoyable.

It's essentially an endless grind simulator where you run the same three levels over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
And face the same enemies over and over and over….. 
The loop is that you unlock a new thing and then need to unlock additional things on the new thing. Rinse - repeat.

I’m 5 hours in and already bored as there is no difference. Yes you get stronger with time but since you reset to 0 for every “run” and RNG decides what you get during your run, there is not really any reason to stick around. 
The fact that all the unlocks, at least so far, feel like they are more or less the same, does not help the situation either. 
There are some “minor” buffs that will unlock and be available to you always, but they are a hardcore grind as well.

Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is sort of like the Diablo 3 endgame, where you run nephalem rift after rift in the hopes to get half a % stronger, maybe. 
Just in this game you get reset to 0 after each run, there is no real manual “difficulty” that you can choose, no co-op nor a leaderboard to compete against, no crafting and no skills.

Seriously, if you haven't played Diablo 3 yet, play it instead. 
Or Grim Dawn.
Or PayDay 2, if you want to do the same but in an FPS. 
These games cost more, yes but they will offer you several hundred hours of playtime as well as a massive amount of content more than Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor does currently and likely ever will. 


4 / 10 
A prime example that if you see a game explode on steam charts it does not mean it's good or worthwhile.

Is the game a new concept? Yes
Is the concept good in a way that one could keep players interested and build upon it? Likely not.


[b]Edit after reaching hazard 5 aka the highest difficulty[/b]
(And no, I’m not mad, I got through the difficulty, but literally wtf..)

Downright pathetic gamestate, score reduced to 2 / 10

Up until hazard 5 the game is, honestly, not hard but then it goes from a difficulty level of, let's say 6/10, to 11/10 due to:
.) Dropping down to as low as 20 FPS and/or stuttering around like crazy because, seemingly, the game engine is overloaded with the amount of mobs.

.) Half of the game's weapons are rendered immediately useless. Some due to balance issues, some due to the inability to control your character properly (no mouse input) and lacking manual targeting/shooting abilities.  

.) Skill? Nah -> RNG.
I played D3 up to rift level 145~ (150 is max), beat Grim Dawn on the highest difficulty and played through Payday 2 on “Death Sentence”, so I got the core idea of mop manipulation and movement but the simple fact that sheer RNG will be the major factor to decide how your game turns out is just dumb and lazy. Even if you count in re-rolls and just “farming”, in the end it amounts to the same: RNG.
I get that this game is following the concept of you just sinking insane amounts of time into it for minor “gain” but even if I look at other RNG based games like autochess, TFT or Hearthstone, they all have an equally high concept of skill behind it.
The only skill in DRG Survivor is to try 20 times so you get good RNG once and win. 
Sure you need to spend an equal amount of hours to find out what weapon combos work but ultimately, yet again, you then rely on RNG to get them (or rather upgrade far enough).",1708386265,1708826378,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Right now it becomes redondant fairly fast and the difficulty spike jump like exponentially, but it's the early access and there's still a lot of potential. The major difference with game compared to other survivor games that I played (vampire survivors, survivor.io mostly), to hav e the best weapons, you need to discover the right combination of weapon and item. In the current format of the game, all you need to do is to level the weapons as there's no concept of items like on the other games, I hope it changes, it would give it more depth.

Also having a coop in this game would be absolutely amazing. I 100% would play with my boys.

Since it's early access, I'm giving it a 7.5/10 as the weapons leveling is too basic in the concept itself, it needs rework and no coop is a bummer and I haven't read any news about the devs about the possibility of coop.

Since the enemy pathfinding flows around the rocks to rach you (with minor exceptions), intelligent pathing and timing, of when you open a new passage, makes a huge difference, both in terms of concentrating the enemy into kill zones and clearing an escape route.

The mining of resources is also more dynamic than the typical of just picking stuff up off the ground. There's a lot of skill involved in choosing whether to go for upgrade minerals, meta-minerals, or focus on farming mobs for XP. The best players will find ways to do both at once, while also facing the right direction while mining, to get maximum effect from their directional weapons. There are also weapon types that excel in tight spaces, like piercing attacks. Digging a long tunnel can be a killer tactic with these.

The classes are all very distinct.
Scout focuses on running and gunning, with a bonus to Move and Crit.
Gunner has a forward-facing gatling, which alters his playstyle. He specializes in Kinetic weapons.
Engineer is very different - using stationary turrets or short-range fire/acid beam weapons and fast mining.
And I haven't done the 4th class yet.

All in all, it's a very refreshing take on the genre and far more engaging than the traditional style. Definitely recommend!",1708808319,1708808319,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Some classes, some weapons, some things to do during a run.
I got enough for my money, and just for that, thank you.

Solid base, but I would recommend to wait for more updates as the gameplay feels a bit... confined (?).

Getting stronger during dives can actually hurt your progression as the more mobs you kill the quicker the timer reach the end, so you dont have time to mine the minerals needed to meta-progress.
The meta-progression doesnt feel like it made me much stronger. After 18h, I still cant farm peacefully the first level. And I still cant succeed a level 3 dive without putting aside mining the minerals that would make me stonger(-ish)... so it feels grindy to me.
Characters always start with the same weapon and you can fully level-up about one of the four weapons during one dive, so it feels like always playing the same things, over and over. 

Lacks diversity, flexibility and over all, a feeling of progression. For me.

Would love to see these implemented:
- Better distinguishable differences between classes and guns, as is in DRG.
- Overclocks having a bit more of an impact. This isn't the case in DRG either, but I think it would suit this game really well.
- Implementing the lore here as well would enhance the experience immensely.
- Lastly, would LOVE to have co-op. I know it's not designed to be that way and Rogue Core is meant to be that but still.

It looks good, mining is fun, farming gold is even more fun, rolling great level ups is fun, being super strong is fun, the classes feel solid, many weapon choices and most of them are quite fun to play and some of them actually feel novel and unique, different builds one can do, etc. However the game is early access and lacks some content one would expect from a full release, on the other hand the game is less than <10€ which makes it worth a purchase even as it is.

Some things that I would love to see some improvement in:
- Only three maps and the main objective of each map is the same and the final boss of each map is the same, however there are some tasks that requires one to play certain class or weapon which is nice.
- Meta process is thin even though I like that one can unlock new weapons and classes but the simple %-upgrades are not novel or interesting, they are linear and do not even scale, there are not milestones or anything to them (even some milestones could make them more interesting, like for example if spend 8 on luck one gets single free-roll per stage or whatever, something that adds more to the game-play).
- Some balance issues, all the classes and most weapons feel solid and strong at their highest potential however due to the fast scaling of difficulty during the game, getting there for most classes is much more inconsistent. Weird decisions such as melee mobs dealing less damage than ranged mobs, which makes the game feel a bit unpolished (player needs to spend most of his attention to dodge barrages of bullets that are 3-hit-kill instead of trying to solve for movement strategy against the horde of melee mobs). Mob damage scaling overall is also a bit too dramatic in my opinion on highest difficulty making the player feel made of glass which makes technically any single mob as dangerous as being just surrounded by the swarm itself. The main difficulty to the game comes from the fact that the mobs just hit too hard which is a bit boring and gives a little room for real improvement, ""just try to dodge all of the 100 bullets instead of 99"". Random factor is too heavily impacting the run in weapon selections, I think this should change so that at least the second weapon (first unlock) could be just picked or that the roll mechanism would never roll the same weapon choices already given. This applies also for the artifacts due to they being heavily unbalanced in strength which makes the random factor again impacting the run too heavily on which choices of artifacts one is given.
- Overclock unlocking mechanism is in my opinion bad. I mean it might be okay for the very first 15 minutes to the game but after longer time it becomes just redundant. It is just a single boring unlock one is forced to do before unlocking the weapons full potential for the future plays.
- Drop pod timer is always the same (30 seconds) after killing the last minor or major boss, I think trying to stall the killing of the boss due to this drop pod timer mechanism to farm the map more is counter productive. A flexible timer (giving player more time to return to drop pod if the boss is killed early) would in my opinion be better by not punishing the player for killing the bosses too fast.",1708783346,1708783407,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I don't think DRG Survivors is in a great state right now. The game does not provide the same highs a survivor-like game does and often times the runs left me feeling frustrated above anything else. 
The secondary objectives for each stage feel really tedious and almost always require you to go out of your way to do them, which is opposite of what the secondaries feel like in base Deep Rock Galactic. But they are crucial for a successful completion of the run, especially once you start playing on higher hazards. 
The permanent upgrades that you buy for credits + resources are extremely basic and minor (+2% to pickup radius, damage, mining speed, etc) and do not provide you with any sense of progression. It doesn't seem to be too ""grindy"" to max them, but they didn't feel rewarding to me once I got them anyway. 
Regarding the weapon upgrades, most of the weapon upgrades for leveling are just basic stat increases (+5/10/15/20% reload speed/fire rate/damage/whatever). There are overclocks, to unlock them you need to dump 12 upgrades into a specific weapon in the same run, and they don't even unlock in the same run, so have fun potentially throwing a few runs just to get the good weapon upgrades. A minor thing is that I found in-game information a bit lacking (for example what does each element's effect does), but I reckon it will be addressed in the future.
I also have personal gripes with the lack of manual aiming for at least one weapon. I understand that it's a design choice, but it did cause me a few frustrating experiences in my short playtime, such as the gunner staring down a dreadnought 10m directly ahead of him and not using the minigun for whatever reason.
I didn't have a good time with the game, but maybe you will? Definitely will revisit this in the future as there's still a lot of interesting ideas that I'd like to see expanded.",1708782861,1708782861,False,3,1,0.52651512622833252,0,True,False,True

Generally speaking, a lot of people explained in detail why it is not a good game right now. 

- balance is bad, 
- most upgrades are useless, 
- leveling up is slow, 
- mob/boss variety is nonexistent, 
- explosion ranges on higher levels are way too large, 
- all ""class-specific"" bonuses bar dodge can be acquired in the game and are worthless, 
- locking weapons behind classes is useless and limits variety,
- the need to restart the run to use overclocks is just there to pad out the runtime, etc.

Would love to see this game become better than it is now. It is not impossible, and most problems are solvable. I want this game to succeed, but cannot recommend it now, because it is arguably one of the more difficult VS-clones on the market right now, and the difficulty is not particularly fair or worth it most of the time.

Original review at 10ish hours:

[strike]The game's great. Balance is all over the place and it is mercilessly difficult early and late-game. However, if a game dev thinks that it is fine to remove a single voice line (""Die like your mother did!"") in a fictional game about fictional creatures killing other fictional creatures just because ""well, it can be a bad experience for this one person that complained about it"", then I have no faith in such a flimsy developer that can be this easily peer-pressured -- and thus, cannot, in good faith, recommend the game.

That's not to say there aren't some blemishes: hit boxes/detection don't necessarily feel consistent: specially with exploder enemies or wasps in 3rd Biome, some starting weapons are clearly better for survival than others and some weapon balancing is very much needed to bring them up to viable options (looking at you mini shock towers).

DRG: Survivor is plagued with terrible voice acting, uninteresting progression, and unforgivably flawed balance.

If you love the same voice lines being repeated over and over, in nothing more than a slight pitch shift between characters, then you'll love this game, otherwise, you'll hate it.

If you love your meta-progression costs to increase exponentially to the point where farming resources for another mere 1% incremental upgrade becomes nigh on pointless about 20 hours into the experience, then you'll love this game, otherwise, you'll hate it.

If you love the idea of different characters and their classes being completely gated out of higher difficulty runs because their weapons literally don't do enough damage against the most basic of mobs before you're inevitably overwhelmed due to the amount of damage the game demands versus what it provides for you, then you'll love this game, otherwise, you'll hate it.

Don't be fooled by the early access tag, this game is feature complete and the development direction is very clear.

This game is so bad, that any curiosity I had to buy the main Deep Rock Galactic game has been killed. If they can ruin the most basic principles of a survivorlike/action roguelike then I'll not waste even more money on any other representation of this franchise under their development ethos.

[b]Positives[/b]

+ The game is very fun
+ A very polish early access (""EA"") game
+ So many different gun and perk combinations - seems endless already and I have no doubt they will keep building on this
+ Gameplay loop is enjoyable although it can get repetitive
+ The sounds and voicelines are great
+ Incredible value for the pricetag

[b]Negatives[/b]

- The first available class is the Scout.  It's very basic and I actually found it quite boring to begin with (while I was learning the game) and this is probably off-putting for new players.  Ironically, it's now my favourite class.
- Enemy variety is quite low - particularly the end-boss - but this is expected for an EA game and no doubt will be built on
- The robot companion needs a lot of work.  I believe this has been confirmed on the roadmap already.
- No tutorial and explanation of various different mechanics, in particular the effect of each elemental attack and the importance of mining.  Overclocking is a big part of the late-game as well that isn't explained at all.

Overall, absolutely loving it.  Recommended.

At the moment upgrades (both in-run and permanent) and boring and linear (damage, fire rate, reload speed, piercing and XP) without exception.

If you were like me and were very excited for a DRG skinned survival game, That's exactly what this is.  But in it's current form, it doesn't scale well.  Most of the upgrades are actually useless.  And though they sound exciting and helpful, they will hurt the players chance of survival. In other words, the devs are have created a game which half of the content should be strictly avoided.  That's bad.

Currently the winning (and seemingly only) strategy is to focus exclusively on 18th level upgrades, trying to maximize DPS with gold and nitra drop pods, making a ""bunker"" until the the elite shows up, and then kiting the entire mob until you kill it, farming EXP. At Hazard 4, your entire run will hinge on RNG giving you the right upgrades and you knowing not to run into corners.  At Hazard 5 you need to be an elite player with the blessing of god.

""Survivor"" games are simple by nature, which often have clear winning strategies, and clear losing ones, and a lot of content in between.  The RNG fight for good outcomes and player skill have a lot more nuance than this, including ways to turn the RNG in your favor, and accepting certain risks for early/mid game strategy to benefit or hurt your endgame.  That's just not possible here. You are a glass cannon with a pickaxe.  Your foes are all bullet sponges who eat rocks for a living. Life is hell.  

But worst of all, No beer, and no Steve!

Jilted difficullty aside, the game is plagued with a number of other aspects in desperate need of refinement. Unfortunate starting weapons, delayed pickup of new weapons, prolonged level-up grinds, some punishing dive requirements, and a frustrating cadence all suck potential out of the game, especially for new players.  

If you level up certain guns to their final form, the game is a cakewalk.  But they take away your pickaxe early on and you are forced to continue mining with your forehead.  So getting to that point is just a chore. This game is a chore.

The best new thing that this game brings to the genre is the mining. I love digging a tunnel to force the enemies into a chokepoint or digging through a wall to make an escape.

What isnt so great is the underwhelming weapons. Some of them just seem too similar or are by default not worth taking one over the other. For example the default flamethrower is too short ranged, and rotates too slow. The sludge pump not only rotates much faster, but it also covers a larger area and leaves a corrosive field behind. It's just hands down the better option.

Maybe I missed it somewhere but there's also a lack of visible stats. I'd like to know what affect certain upgrades will have. Is a 15% increase in fire rate good? How do I know what stats are worth upgrading if i cant see them? [Edit: I did miss it]

-Macteras tend to shoot stuff at you, they'd be scarier if they (or at least the elite macteras) could shoot projectiles at around a similar speed to the acid spitters' projectiles

And I've also noticed it's not really clear how life regen works (namely how often your HP regenerates), regen seems to kick in pretty sporadically. Oh, and there's not enough rock & stoning for my taste. Besides those nitpicks, the game is great so far and I'm really excited to see what the devs have in store <3

I will revisit the game and review in the future, but at the moment I feel like i have to give it a thumbs down.

Did not encounter any major bugs (heh) but did see a few times where mobs, including mini bosses got randomly stuck and refused to move from 1 spot. Somehow the supply drop messed up their pathing.

Gameplay wise- The game rushes you thru each stage too fast. Does not give you any time to actually enjoy the game. Drop-pod leaving after only 30sec is way too fast as well. No time to finish a 2nd objective (if you havent finished it during the run).. or collect some exp on the ground... you just have go straight for the pod or  gameover.
Overall the game just makes you feel stressed from start of finish. they should slow it down a bit, and give more time to get to the pod.

RNG factor is also bigger than most similar game in the genre. You get outscale and outswarmed in this game way too fast if you dont get a bunch of high tier upgrades early on (mostly in higher difficulties)

Also lacks stuff like manual aim. Some weapons are outright unusable without this feature. Trying to aim manually makes you walk in the direction of the mobs, which often results in taking a lot of dmg. But that is the only to hit mobs with some weapons.

And honestly, overall the weapons are not well balanced either. There are a few which are insanely good, but not even available on every class it seems... which in turn also makes some of the classes significantly worse.

If they can fix some of this stuff, would definitely make it more enjoyable.",1708733190,1708733190,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The original game (in which I have 250+ hours) thrived on the feeling of beating back hundreds of murderous bugs and scraping by in an environment that, more than anything else, wants you dead.
Survivor, then, is a game that thrives on the feeling of beating back thousands of murderous bugs, so let's start with the positives.
[list]
	[*]The modelling work is fantastic. The game's visual style is distinct, but reminiscent of DRG in just the right way. The only visual assets reused that I noticed were menu icons.
	[*] Digging is a lot of fun, if a little bit slow. The ability to mine bunkers into walls and abandon them as soon as you get overwhelmed is great, and it's a blast to design your own near-misses with death.
	[*]Performance is rock-solid on my rig (R5 5600G, RTX2070S, 16GB RAM). It's easy to make a game like this run terribly - even Vampire Survivors chugs towards the end - but DRG:S is a smooth experience the whole way through.[*]The core of the game itself is fun - this is not a total indictment against the game, and if it seems up your street you should pick it up and give it a go. Early Access means that the title gets some leeway, and in 12 months I think it'll be great.
[/list]
With those things said, here are the things I don't like about the game right now, and hope that they will be addressed.
[list]
	[*]The final boss is pretty terrible, and there's only one so you always know what you'll be fighting. An enormous hitbox with an extremely telegraphed lunge attack that deals a huge amount of damage leads to one of three outcomes in my experience:
	[list]
		[*]A fairly easy (see: boring) fight where you kite the boss around the stage until it's dead
		[*]""What the hell!? I got trapped by bugs and couldn't move!""
		[*]""Goddammit, I didn't react to the telegraph fast enough and my move speed was too low so I got one-shot...""
	[/list]
	[*]The game feels content-padded to the Nth degree.
	Overclocks are unlocked once a weapon reaches level 12, which takes quite a long time, and they aren't even unlocked for the run you're on. Without overclocks, runs feel wasted or overly difficult, and losing a run right before you unlock the overclocks for a weapon feels awful.
	[*]The stat upgrades are fairly boring percentage increases in stats. I get that we need something to spend our mined minerals on, but these get expensive really fast and, honestly, aren't enjoyable to grind for.
	[*]The content in the game in places feels somewhat uncreative. 
	[list]
		[*]Overclocks themselves are generally uncreative stat boosts. The few that aren't are great fun; I'd like to see the devs get a lot crazier with these.
		[*]Artifacts suffer the same fate as overclocks. Not massively exciting, though the potential is obvious for cool combos if slightly reworked.
	[/list]
	[*]Voicelines are mostly reused from DRG, and I personally noticed some wonky audio mixing between each one. This one isn't a deal breaker at all, but later in the game's early access life it would be nice for it to get its own unique set of lines to really set the atmosphere apart from DRG.
[/list]

All in all, I can't recommend this game in its early access launch state. However, GSG are great developers for DRG original, and I have to imagine they'll guide this game well as its publisher.

I'm not a huge player of what I suppose is the ""roguelite arena survival"" genre but this one has me hooked. It has DRG's charm, nice graphics, and I love the added intractability with the map that mining offers you versus similar titles in the genre which generally consist of completely open fields.

I will say that I have a few complaints though. 

First off, unlocking overclocks sucks. Any run you dedicate to leveling up a new weapon to 12 is basically thrown as a loss because of how powerful overclocks are. Perhaps once you hit 12 on a new gun, you get to pick 2 OC's from the 6/12 pool for it, then proceed to level it up further to 18 during that same run if you want. As it stands, the current system discourages experimentation which is really kind of the point of this genre. 

Lvl 18 Overclocks in general are a bit too strong, IMO. The correct way to play seems to just giga pump one weapon and pick up utility in all other slots. Basically any weapon can carry a run with a lvl 18 OC, but that means you're either pumping your starter or the weapon you get at lvl 5, as the lvl 15 weapon comes too late and the lvl 25 is always just a wash. Feels weird/bad to have 2 to 3 weapon slots every run that are just there because you have to pick something. Maybe this is a personal playstyle issue but it seems worse in every scenario to level up multiple guns halfway rather than cranking an early acquired gun to lvl 18.

WASD controls are rough for a lot of the ""shoots in facing direction"" weapons. An option for mouse turning would be nice. Playing on controller is fine though, and is what I've been doing since my first run with the Warthog.

I do like how elements from the original game, DRG (my beloved) have been well-translated to this, including the iconic ""V"" to ""Rock and Stone!"". However, most autoshooters play to a sort of power-fantasy endgame, where your cumulative upgrades ultimately make you feel nearly immortal, and doing big gobs of damage all over the screen. Games like 20 minutes till Dawn execute this perfectly. DRG Survivor attempts to do this via the unstable overclocks unlocked at lvl 18, but they simply aren't powerful enough to play to that power-fantasy endgame. Sure, they're good. But they're almost never GREAT because enemies feel tanky regardless of how many damage mods you stack. In addition to that, non-overclock upgrades rarely feel impactful, even as they stack into the lategame, and the only powerup drop in the game at this point is the magnet, which is excessively rare. Lastly, the rogue-lite elements (permanent upgrades between runs) lack impact as well, and are limited to minor buffs to our character, with increasingly scaled costs. I'd personally like to see upgrades both for our character, and for Bosco, to add more rogue-lite elements and (perhaps) make our decisions between rounds feel like they have more meaning. Ultimately this game gets a thumbs up from me, but not because of its current state. I'm sure that the devs will make improvements here and there, and I anticipate the finished product will be a far better experience, but as I said in the beginning, this game is OK for now.",1708592904,1708728627,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Right now it feels.. weird to play. There's a weird balance of over- and underpowered weapons. Most of the upgrades are simply ""increase stat X"", only a handful really change up the weapon or the gameplay.

Personally I do not like the idea of having to level up a weapon to 12 in order to unlock overclocks for the next run. It kind of forces you to deal with a weapon in its 'weak' state combined with the fact that the in-game upgrades don't have much variety.

The difficulty progression can be overwhelming. If your weapons don't pack a punch (namely because you don't get good upgrades or you don't have overclocks unlocked) you spend most of your time clinging for survival.
If you do end up with good upgrades it is usually towards the end of the dive where the game is pretty much already over.

The final boss is.. boring. It walks and jumps towards you. If you have OP weapons you are pretty much done. If you happen to be cornered when it jumps to you it may end your run.

I like the mining system, but it's overshadowed by overwhelming swarms and the limited terrain. Enemies also have a tendency to hide behind the walls and pretty much get a sneaky hit on you.

I believe most of the issues can be fixed simply if upgrades are treated differently, but as it is right now my runs are split up into ""I have good weapons, easy run"" and ""I simply cannot keep up with the swarms"".

I still think the game is relatively fun, but you might want to grab it during a sale for now.",1708721136,1708721136,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,True

The mining system really brings a lot to the Survivor formula. It has a good 5 or 6 hours of content, but I expect this to grow over the course of the early development. I'm hoping we get more unique upgrades or more intricate objectives. Digging out a resupply LZ during a swarm is really stressful and requires forethought, it makes me wish we had more objectives like it.

Unfortunately, the upgrades are just simple stat buffs, and a good chunk of the overclocks are too... If the aiming and shooting is automatic, then players want more depth and agency somewhere else, this genre is all about that. [b]The mining is great for creating that depth, but the build-making (or lack thereof) is a bit too simple to provide much agency.[/b]

in short meta progression is near pointless, upgrades dont feel impactful until you get *some* overclocks. unlocking new weapons and character variants is a chore and so is unlocking overclocks for said weapons, out of the 5 difficulties even has 2 and 3 feel impossible unless you get good RNG/enemy spawns/weapons

Rock and stone for everyone!

if you like Deep Rock Galactic and also fancy auto shooters like Vampire Survivors or Brotato, the you will love this game.

It adds to this emerging genre with a lot of content already, themed around Deep Rock Galactic. The base game loop reflects that of the game its based off of, but in a more concentrated format.

Fully playable and enjoyable in early access. A  perfect match for the SteamDeck and other similar handhelds.

---

With that said, there are some things I would like to see changed or at least have the option of modifying.

1. The end timer is wayy too short. I get we aren't supposed to meander around after completing a ""floor"" to collect everything, but 30 seconds if you're already massively kiting is nary enough. I've lost runs just because I was forced to run through a horde to try and make it to the drop-pod in time and ended up just dying from damage (expected).
I would like to see it changed from 30 seconds to 45 seconds or a flat 60 seconds.

2. There currently exists some balancing issues with some of the weapons. Namely, the ""beam"" weapons can be pretty under-powered unless you focus level them. But then you get to the late-game and that's the only high-leveled weapon(s) you have. This might not be an issue per-say but rather the intended outcome of not choosing a more balanced set of weapons. In one instance, I had fully upgraded flamethrower, sludge cannon, and flame turrets. I could not kill enemies fast enough around me and ended up getting swarmed.
The only reason I bring up this is the possibility of more interesting build choices.
With that said, this isn't necessarily a stop-gap that needs to be fixed. Maybe running beam weapons is supposed to be more challenging?

3. A few bugs and issues I've encountered so far.
 - On controller, you can begin moving immediately after regaining control from the pod. On keyboard, you have to release the keys and repress them to start moving.
- Some performance issues that bring the Steamdeck down a little, which drains the battery. This is to be expected with the sheer volume of entities and models in the world, especially towards the end-game. However, it would be nice (and probably already planned) to incorporate some changes to allow for lower-end systems and handhelds to gain better performance.
- You can glitch the exit countdown and stay on a floor indefinitely. No doubt will be fixed.
- Due to how floors are generated, sometimes there are single-tile crevasses you can get hung up on while fleeing enemies that isn't obvious why you stopped moving. If these lie within a cluster of rock, it's even worse.

4. Some of the upgrades seem to be just negative overall. Maybe this isn't the case due to never actually picking them, or perhaps there are unique synergies I'm missing out on. I'm not saying that every upgrade should be positive in every way, but it would be better to follow the same kind of design principals that Deep Rock Galactic follows of upgrades having interesting trade-offs.

still love this game, but it doesn't give that fun feeling anymore. just the feeling of playing another grindy action roguelike.

Enabled data analytics without my consent and only noticed after going into the options.

Also perfectly fine with their forum mods insulting customers and generally acting like a group of spoilt children it seems.

Given the data collection and endorsement of anti-consumer behaviour,I have removed the game from my steam account.

Almost good but mostly a chore.

-Sub-par meta progression.
-Lack of enemy variety.
-Way too grindy.
  -Exp earned in a run is far too low.
  -Class levelling is insanely slow.
  -Resource gathering for upgrades,again,super slow
-Too many resources for the same task. Gold/nitra both buy upgrades but serve only to lock you out of them if you get unlucky on one type. Same story for the meta progression resources.
-Feels like the devs count too much on the DRG name carrying the project to success.

There are some serious problems with the core game design that turn it into an absolute chore that should be addressed, but hey removing a single voice line gets into the patch notes.

Having spent countless hours plumbing the depths of alien worlds, blasting bugs, and bringing home loot with my crew of jolly space dwarves in 2020’s excellent Deep Rock Galactic, I was curious how the experience would translate to a single-player, top-down approach in Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor. Let me tell you—it translates brilliantly!

Familiar Yet Fresh: Survivor retains the heart of the original while offering a refreshing twist. As one of four distinct classes armed with auto-firing weapons, you deploy into a hostile environment to squash endless insectoid enemies. But here’s the unique angle: mining. You’ll need to dig up gold and nitra to buy upgrades, harvest rare minerals for permanent unlocks, and rush to collect specific resources on each floor for bonus objectives.

Good Vibes: From energetic dialogue barks to the bombastic soundtrack, Survivor delivers on those good vibes. It’s a subculture of its own within multiplayer co-op, and there are nods to the community and player-made memes that show this spin-off was thoughtfully put together.

Reloads Matter: Survivor introduces reloading to the genre. Since you can’t trigger a reload manually, you must keep a careful eye on your ammo bars. Reloads add an interesting dimension to crafting builds. Prioritizing reload time upgrades becomes crucial for tough runs.

Gunner Glory: As a Gunner, mowing down hordes of bugs with a torrent of lead from multiple nozzles never gets old. But now, reload management adds depth. It’s the difference between being a walking death machine and getting overwhelmed.
Satisfying Sound Effects: The sound effects of smashing bugs and rocks give off a sense of accomplishment. Every swing of the pickaxe reverberates with purpose.",1708701987,1708701987,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I am a fan of both of these games but I think it fails at both styles. It is trying to be something new but taking wrong lessons. I think all my gripes with the game can be resolved but I don't think the developer is going to change the direction of the game. 

Visual presentation is great but the game has visibility issues, some mission side objectives are obscured by terrain (you can still see on minimap). XP orbs are too bright and can obscure some small enemies.

Upgrades would be OK except you can't have overclocks unless you upgrade weapon to level 12 in one dive before. This is artificial game length padding and very annoying.

Another problem is how you finish the level, because if you kill enemies too fast you will have to end it too soon to gather enough nitra/gold to upgrade weapons. It punishes you for killing enemies too fast. Levels are generated so if you don’t find resources in the first few minutes (RNG on top of RNG) then you will have a hard time finding them later. This is also why mining speed is the most important upgrade (another RNG).

This would be fine if enemies were arriving in waves but they are just arriving constantly so killing them faster will not work and will spawn bosses faster. You have to remember that you can't avoid shooting bosses other than just running away so again you need mining speed. 

All of this is frustrating and has nothing to do with difficulty, but everything with not giving you enough control over your actions. I cannot recommend the game at this time.

I still havent finish with the game, but I just unlocked the artifact thus 100% achievement. That took 40 hours and probably it will longer to to clear all difficulties. There are also alot meta-progression, so you will discover more crazy combination of weapons while you playing the game.

This could be the most polished / beautiful game for said genre and there are some strategic thinking required when playing the game.

The version currently offered adds levels, allows you to play other classes, test other weapons... In short, it adds content.

The content offered is well provided for a game in alpha, and I am convinced that it will continue to expand, be refined, and offer more synergies and builds.

The level design is successful. Each biome has its own atmosphere, impossible to confuse them.
I think it is possible to push the work a little further and make them even more different from each other, both visually and technically.

Events specific to each biome and difficulty would be a blessing.

The only real problem with the game at the moment is its speed of completing objectives. The bar fills up too quickly and it is impossible to take advantage of the objectives and your build. I want my dwarf to have time to dig, to harvest, and to find himself in very tense moments because he is stingy.

I also hope that other types of waves, monsters or events related to filler will complete the whole thing.

The game has a format that would allow it to be adapted to different playing times, solo or multiplayer. I would definitely see the arrival of an express mode (which would rather resemble the current version (improved, of course)), a normal mode and a long mode.
Endless is yet another kettle of fish and has been announced for the future.

General feel of the game is REALLY REALLY GOOD (certainly worth the money)
-------------------------------------------------------------
What could use some attention:
1) Events - cool but little variety. same stuff over and over again. Art. drop could be random out of 4-5 little objectives instead of 1. Secondary objective could be virtually anything...
2) Enemies - cool but again, no surprises, Variety from run to run would be welcome.
3) Characters/classes - feels shallow, there is very little difference (impact on the game) between classes, most of class specifics is worth few lvl-up bonuses and limited gun set you will be choosing from.
4) Each class mod run different wepons - but for some reason they are not listed anywhere... learning by doing.
5) Artifacts could be made more impactful. Few % dodge chance or reload speed ain't magic.
6) Talent/skill tree - flat % bonuses (boring)
7) Shop economy - meh, incremental impact on the game, you basically buy few lvl-ups if you mined enough of gold or red gold.
8) Game modes - NONE, just 3 maps with 5 difficulty levels.
9) Looks like pretty cool base for a multiplayer (PvP, Coop PvE)

All in all game is great, just seem to me like slightly underutilized potential. I'd love to see developement direction towards Nordic Ashes: Survivors of Ragnarok with multiple levels of character, equipement and talent tree complexity. Idea is great, engine works super smooth.

On the Surface Level... the game is true to the Lore of DRG. But DRG-Survivor is sadly one of those games, where the Developer didn’t understand why Vampire Survivors was so successful.

Some points come to mind:
Balanced RNG
Clever Positioning to mow down the hordes of Evil.
Progression Systems that value the lifetime of the consumer.
Lots of varieties of Core Classes
Lots of varieties to build up your virtual Barbie or Ken.
The “Carrot” to keep you positively hooked.
That's a few of my opinions, what makes the Vampire Survivor Genre so much fun to play

DRGS has none of these!

The Game is (in my opinion) an unbalanced Mess. 
That will raise his ugly Head a few Hours in.
Best Example:
The Dreadnought Boss has a JUMP - Attack without telegraphing his intentions where he wants to land… (on the player thou..)
YOU can’t Kite him because you fire in the front direction… 
He is faster than you…
So If you turn around to show him yours truly Gatling Gun…
nah
He is on to you in a millisecond, or he jumps into your face,,, 

Other weird design decisions (again, my opinion):
The Stage Phases progress way too fast for completing your Mission in one go.

The Store Credits must be mined… without any marker via HUD or a Mini Map. .
Because all is going too fast… your Progression turns into a Grind fest…

Mining minerals and stuff… is much, much  slower than normal Rocks. In later stages, you can’t mine anymore the stuff you need, because the bugs are humping you… combined with the Front-Firing Arc. a death sentence.

In later Stages the bugs get faster and faster… faster than you… Elite Bugs rushing through the Rocks, like a hot Knife through Butter… and because there is no Kiting… Death awaits…

During the Eye-Candy, you can't see near Bugs, in a Game of Positioning, deadly.

Weapons are locked behind a Level Gate. Every Dwarf gets 4 of them… very fast, you have seen all there is in the “Charles Heston little Gun Shop” Department.

Also, not much variation in the Artifacts, Items, Equipment and so forth. After 2–3 Hours, you have seen everything.

The procedural generated Map can lead you into a Cul-de-sac. Followed by: “A swarm is approaching… “Game over Man, Game Over”. 

After 4 Hours of Gameplay:
The DigDug System is a very good thought of the Developer
Sadly, hindered by the “Slow Mining of Minerals” Decision.
The Price is good!

In my Book, DRG feels rushed, unbalanced, not Fun! 
The Progression System would get Korean Pro Grinders angry… too much grind…
It feels not like an Early Access Game… more like a Proof-of-Concept, Early Alpha Version of what may come to DRGS.

60/100

What would in my Opinion benefit the Game:
Twin stick Mechanic like in Soulstone Survivor.
Forced Reload Button, for the Swarm Warning. (Even as an Update Artifact!)
Kiting, see Twin stick.
Dodge Roll, if you want to keep the “Jump Attack”
Better Mission System
Better paced Levels… we are Miners, not Troopers on Klendathu
Better UI / HUD Elements to let the Gamer grasp the Situation better.
Outlined Bugs if they get near you
Telegraphed Attacks and other QoL improvements.

On paper, this game seems very interesting, but after playing for hours, its boring. (current patch: Hotfix 0.2.241d)
However, I'm curious on how the DRG weapons are implemented, so I'm playing for more hours to unlock the remaining weapons, which sad to say at the moment, its not rewarding. For those who care, the meta progression is awefully stingy and not worth the time for late-game.

Also, I played enough survivor-like games to figure out that this early access is NOT designed with the overpowered-endgame-build roguelike experience, which is the final straw for my negative review.

EDIT: Currently the late-game experience is terrible, weapons unlocked after rank 12 are underwhelming, having bad stats or overall the same mechanic. Also, the balancing is off on hazard 5, maybe more contents in future will help, but as of now, its purposely made to be impossible to push players away from full completion, early access or not, its disgusting for completionist.

[h2]More Rants[/h2]
- first, why no shield?
- need encylopedia page for unlocked weapon info (for overclocks as well, see next)
- overclocks should NOT be locked behind 12-levels (maybe unlocks entry in encyclopedia instead)
- unstable overclocks should be more drastic (like boomerang collect XP, this one good) for an impactful build
- different weapons don't have special synergy
- hazard 5 is impossible, calling it ""challenge to skillful player"" won't change the fact that its just bad level design
- DoT damage is too low, investing upgrade into these has no meaning, should either scales better with each upgrade, or mechanically change it to have distinct effects (like % based, amplify damage, etc)
- no loadout customization or random events to make interesting gameplay (although there's [spoiler]golden lootbug[/spoiler])
- lootbug should not be immune to weapon damage or explosion
- personally, I prefer spending resources to unlock weapon instead of grinding each class
- or, meta progression for each weapon, potentially unlocks overclock at the end (could be a nice goal for grinding)
- it seemed that once everything maxed, overflowing resources are useless (but during run, I still need to mine them for XP)

[h2]Personal Prefences/Issues[/h2]
- I'm sad to discover that flamethrower spins instead of shooting forward
- Gunner's minigun shooting forward is okay, but useless while mining (please make it do some mining, or start cooldown when not shooting)
- Engineer's shotgun should not auto-shoot when there's no target in front (but its working great when converted into plasma)
- [strike]Gunner's LeadBurster stuck above wall, causing it to miss[/strike] (fixed)
- Most grenades, should explode faster or upon impact, currently it always missed the target due to the delay
- I'm very upset that Breach Cutter [spoiler]shoots balls[/spoiler] and does not pierce through wall
- Autocannon is like a scuffed assault rifle, NGL
- Smart Rifle is dumb, target-locking is way too slow (i doubt can be improved with upgrades)
- Deepcore PGL (the grenade launcher) deals too little damage and too slow, and, the explosion SFX with smoke is blocking vision
- Impact Axe is awesome, BUT, it sometimes pushes enemies towards the player",1708235541,1708680555,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you're looking at this you should buy Vampire Survivors with all the dlc for about the same price instead.
If you already did the above. really like Deep Rock Galactic and have $10 to burn, then you might like this.

Played the demo to death when it was first available and had a good time knowing that nothing was final.
It's in early access now so I'm still lenient, but I'm also disappointed with it's current state.

-No Miner's Manual, figured this would be like the first thing they would add.
-Aiming on weapons suck, especially throwables. Get used to being chased by a swarm 100 times over and your weapons to target the fresh solitary grunt spawning off screen.
-Poor weapon balance, especially with the higher hazards the weak weapons will end up feeling even weaker.
-Item pools fill with trash fast. Most classes share weapons, so the more you unlock trash the more your choices will be filled with trash.

I came in as a big fan of both Deep Rock and Vampire Survivor like games but it unfortunately feels very underwhelming.
The key problem is the pacing and balance feel very off. Enemies get incredibly bullet spongy, with many of the weapons needing re-balancing to make them even viable. Levels end up being a slog of kiting a big blob of bugs around the map as you plink away at them while trying to do mission objectives and snag resources. Outside of exploding bugs and spitters all the enemies feel the same, just with slightly different health pools.
Upgrades are mostly disappointing minor stat upgrades that make numbers go up. I never feel like I am putting together a build, just choosing whatever gives the best bonus. Overclocks are boring and do little to spice up gameplay. Permanent upgrades are a boring grind for minor % bonuses. It all feels like a lot of grinding for a slow trickle of underwhelming rewards. 

The good news is all of this is definitely fixable, but right now I would recommend waiting on this to see how it cooks. There is a decent foundation for a game here, but right now the balancing and pacing of it makes it not very fun to play.

So there is a lot of variety and more is already announced. And of course - you have to unlock all! There are also difficulty levels so you can test your mettle at higher levels while you unlock permanent bonuses like a roguelike.

There is a lot of questionable balancing, but its version 1 of early access so that's to be expected (although the recon scout feedback from the beta several months ago seemingly went ignored). I very much hope that the developers take a good look at the data they get from players. 

The Zhukovs, for example, are just okay to supplement your existing build. However, when they are your starting weapon (recon scout) they feel downright anemic as your sole damage dealer. Most of the time, 75% of the damage is wasted due to bugs clumping up in a single pack. 

Attempting the Hazard 4 Crystalline Caverns challenge of ""Reach (level) 55 as recon scout"" is an absolutely miserable experience. You can try it countless times and get maybe to the beginning of stage 3 at the most, on average. Then you try it as gunner and reach the dreadnaught stage on your first try with considerably less effort. Yeah, it's that kind of funky (un)balance. (That's not to say either of these are balanced correctly, but the requirement is specifically scout, and that's just not happening)

But like I said, it's version 1 of early access. There is plentiful time to listen to feedback and make balance changes accordingly.

Some points:
- you're constantly fighting to stay ahead of the difficulty curve, there's almost no downtime during the dives
- dives are relatively short and honestly for this type of gameplay, slightly slower paced but longer dives would feel MUCH better
- it's not easy to get the resources needed to upgrade your your character power overall, when you have very little time to gather resources/kill monsters/get materials all at once
- it feels bad leaving XP on the floor after each stage ends, if some of that got auto-collected at a lower point value or something it would be quite nice

Things I loved about:
- The game is damn fun. To a point that it can be quite addicting.
- No bs or whatever. Straight into the action as soon as you load it.
- Graphics are great, the whole contrast of colors and scenes is quite pleasing.
- Easy to learn and quite forgiving if you make a mistake.

Things I believe could be improved:
- CO-OP in this game is going to be a massive change! I can honestly imagine players laughing their asses off playing with their friends.
- Game play is too linear. All the levels feel the same. Level 5 is somehow empty; mining gold and nitra at this level feels ""meh"" regardless of what you do.
- Boss mechanics are very easy to learn. Some unknown behavior to it might be a nice touch.
- Game being too linear it only allows you to focus on certain things, whether you want it or not (depending on what buffs or wpns u got). The wpns you get are pretty much RNG and you never know which build you gonna end up with. I am not saying this should be changed, but...perhaps if the actual level or biome you are playing on requires different thinking compared to others; most likely it will make the game more diverse.
- Minor thing, but when you choose a buff or new wpn, the outline of what is selected is a bit faint. I cant remember how many times I've chosen the wrong stuff because of this. It automatically selects one for you. Let us choose it instead. Make it more visible.
- Perhaps a level that you don't know if it is going to be a 5min lvl or a 30 min lvl. 
- Mini games like ""you want that supply? Allright you got to farm first X o Y amount of resources or mobs"". The reward being quite appealing in order to make that effort and sacrifice.

Can think of a bunch of stuff.
Overall the game is great, feels nice, quite familiar to ""certain"" mobile games out there.

New issue repeated itself and re-arose. Steam WebUI screaming at me, halting my computer, crashing my browser.

I have put a little bit of time in and so far it is super fun.
Pros:
The ability to make diverse builds that usually differ from each run.
Most of the challenges are actually challenging.
Cons: 
Weapons are either really good or really bad. Both of these become apparent after leveling the weapon.
Early levels on higher hazards are extremely difficult for characters that requires levels for good weapons.
Some challenges are more difficult than the achievements.
Health, Movement, Crit. chance, and Crit. Damage are all you need to level. (Nothing else feels like it matters)
Other than completion and character XP, there is nothing you will gain from higher hazards.

There will be balance patches and the like as the game progresses. 
For now play for fun, don't touch hazard 4 or 5 unless going for completion. It's easier to farm mats on lower hazards.",1708661249,1708661249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Allow me to elaborate:
1) Unlocking overclocks for a weapon is only possible on the next run (weakens a new player, unfun, grindy)
2) The drop pod timer is too strict (creates tension but causes frustration in most cases)
3) The hitboxes on some bugs - especially the Dreadnought - feel wrong.
4) The bugs' attacks deal a LOT of damage (fine with me, but 3) makes taking damage feel cheap)
5) Only one of four classes is available from the start
6) The game collects a mountain of data from your PC, opting in does nothing, everything about you has already been stolen.
7) Inability to manually aim your weapons
8) Grenades and other throwables work very poorly and most of the time end up away from the horde, IF ONLY I WAS ABLE TO AIM
9) The meta progression is awful and boring
10) Unrelated to the game itself, but the foul aura of toxic positivity emanating from the community is infuriating.
11) Again, not a criticism, but a hub of sorts would be nice.


What I DID enjoy:
1) Variety of weapons (along with some new ones)
2) Tanky enemies and their sheer numbers
3) All the eye-catching audiovisual fluff every game in this genre has
4) All the classes I've unlocked so far have been very neat in terms of shaking up the playstyle.

TL;DR: This feels like an in-house concept that somehow made its way to Steam. I sincerely hope that the game will get better over time, yet for this to happen a handful of core mechanics have to be reworked.

- [u] focus on upgrading new weapons first [/u] , so as to unlock overclocks (you may be surprised as how much they can improve gameplay)

- [u] use terrain to your advantage [/u] so as not to get caught by multi-directional flow of enemies during swarm events (eg. dig tunnels to channel enemies or prepare escape route)

- [u] supply-pods can take-out large enemies [/u] which will help you to get rid of mini-bosses and stronger enemies fast (so sometimes it is worth leaving them drop-ready for when you should need extra impact dmg)

- [u] acheivements unlock new supply-pod perks [/u] some of which will buff your health-regen or dmg significantly

- [u] scrap unwanted overclocks [/u] to keep the slots free for better ones as you level-up your gun (there is no actual limit to upgrading weapon mid-game and scrapping gives you rare or legendary weapon buff as compensation for overclock)

- [u] mid-run focus either on elemental builds or kinetic [/u] in order to make best use of the overall dmg boosts (many weapons can switch damage types with overclocks)

- [u] SHORT ELEMENT SUMMARY: [/u] plasma = bounce / electric = dmg buff & stun / fire = high dmg over time / sludge = slow & dmg over time ",1708640111,1708641950,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Only thing I wish they would change is the stage departure timer. 30 seconds IS enough, but I wouldn't mind a little more.

Also some aspects or challenges in this game feel almost impossible and become very annoying after a while, for example there's a map where you have to mine 150 ""nitra"", some red stone and I tried over 20 times but it is just not possible if you don't get the luckiest random map layout 5 levels in a row. And noone want's to play that damn map over and over again just to achieve that.

Also there's sidequests in every level, collecting a certain amount of mushrooms (12), blue stones (20) or flowers (6) will give you extra nitra and gold. Somehow if you get unlucky, you have to collect these flowers and it is like 10 times more difficult than the other two types, so much that I don't even try to find them anymore.
Other comparable games feel so satisfying that you can't wait to start the next level, but here you sometimes have to force yourself to, because it can be frustrating at times and at the end of each mission your kinda glad it's over.
On top of that, most of the challenges you have to achieve to make progress include playing a class, a build or a weapon that you just don't want to play. You can't pick your favorite build and weapon to play because doing that you'll always be stuck and not be able to make progresss at all.

This is a running/mining simulator and not so much a survivor game. If you enjoy games like Nordic, Vampire Survivor, Soulstone, 20 Mins, etc  you will not enjoy this.

Classes are not balanced, weapons are the same unless you get a specific build you will not win. Almost all of the upgrades you get from the supply beacon are just worthless and don't make any actual difference. They should put the overclocks in the drops or something.

Meta upgrades are holy crap expensive, you get 2-4 of most upgrade mats per 4 level run. Right now I'm seeing upgrades that require 60...80...100 of each material? Holy. That is going to take an unreal amount of time. Seems extremely out of balance.

I even went so far as to edit my save to give me enough credits and materials to buy every single meta upgrade, and it still feels like a losing battle, I just can't recommend this game as it stands, its not balanced and it just doesn't feel fun at any point. I want to like it, I love the original game, Rock and Stone!, but I just can't get behind this attempt.

They somehow made a game that can keep you engaged while literally playing with one single thumbstick.  No, really, the whole game... One thumbstick.

The keyboard control felt a bit janky, like it wasn't moving at correct angles.  I tried on a controller and it was smooth as butter.  I'm sure the keyboard controls will be worked out later on in the early access.

As far as content goes, there's not a ton right now.  There's only 3 maps with multiple difficulties.  Again, the game has just come to early access and I'm sure more content will be added over time.  As far as the account progression, there's a ton to unlock, and the classes all feel very unique and have playstyles that differ enough from each other to make them feel like their own thing.  

The game is more challenging than some of the other VS-Style games I've played.  The game can be very unforgiving, and recovering from a mistake can take some time and thinking on your feet.  

Overall if they continue development with their current vision in mind, and add an ""infinite mode"" later on, this game is gonna slap way harder than it already is.

It can be a bit difficult when you first start off as you have no progression buffs yet, and no weapons unlocked along with their over clocks upgrades. But once you start playing more things begin to open up and the fun really begins. Just stick with it, this game is not instant gratification and full unlocks at the first play.  But it does start to really get a bit easier on the first tier of difficultly after about 2 hours of gameplay and a few unlocks. You have to actually play which pushes you a bit to play and try things you may not usually do. And I was happily surprised with 1 of the classes i thought i wouldn't play much. 

I keep finding new combos of weapons and upgrades that shocked me how well they can do after i had them marked as useless. And some of the weapons are down right hilariously OP when you get them maxed out with just the right perks and over clocks during a run.  So far most weapons I see have a purpose although there are few duds that just don't work to well for this type of game and its current balance. And some only work well if you get lucky with certain perks during a run (yes some RNG is involved in this game but overall not bad). 

Check out ""The Road Ahead"" post for what is planned in the next few months. Even with Early Access tag the game plays so much better than other Early Access games, and this company has a great record with other games of theirs I played and the community in their games is usually really good and they are responsive to the customers and what is coming up.  Last the game is priced well and not a 50 dollar money grab so I would recommend picking it up now at the nice on sale price.

Already got my money worth in a time when most games fall way short so this is a nice relief from that feeling.

First thing first, this might be a good game... in a future. The DRG (not survivor) is an awesome game, probably the best co-op until 2024.

But... The devs have a lot to work on.
After 5 hours of gameplay I can assure you that every mission feels the same. It's repetitive and grindy.
All cool stuff is locked behind the boring and farming progression.

Dwarf is too slow, the exp box is too small, bugs do not die fast enough. Probably after spending A LOT OF RESOURCES and credits the game will feel ok.
Timers for the drop pod and killing bosses feel cheap and unfair.
And when you finally make your build during the run, the game just ends.
Longer runs with different objectives and variety would be way better.

For now I recommend other Survior games, like: Time Wasters.

DRGS has a lot of good things going for it but it also is in that Early Access stage where a lot of features present in other games are missing. 

The good parts:
Fun DRG theme that if you love DRG you will enjoy the dwarf setting and flavor.
Weapon variety is nice and does feel fun to kill hordes of bugs.
Mining Mechanic allows great moments of rushing to get away from a huge horde of bugs to get to a safer area, as well as gathering the resources for meta upgrades like in regular DRG.
Class system is nice to give the existing 4 dwarves some variety, as there are 3 specializations per class allowing for 12 different starting play styles. 
The 5 levels per dive and the shop afterward are very reminiscent of Nordic Ashes as they are very similar in that regard.
Secondary objectives like in regular DRG are present. Collect Morkite, Apoca Bloom, and Boolo Caps are the only ones in the game at this moment. Perhaps some kind of Aquarq or other objective may be added in the future.
Analytics opt out. Very nice to see.

The Bad:
Given it is early access, like I said before many other features present in other games in this genre are not present. Banish, Skip, Sealing meta upgrades are not present. Only Rolling is present at the moment. 
Weapon upgrades and stats are not clearly explained at first glance. How much does a reload speed upgrade exactly affect your reload speed? You only find out in the weapon stats after you pick the upgrade. Soulstone and Nordic Ashes both have this feature to show you exactly what your upgrade does before you pick it.
There is no key rebinding in the game at this moment. I recommend playing with a controller as you really only need the left thumbstick and the face buttons.
DRGs also lacks a feeling of screen clearing godlike power that other games in the genre allow you to have. Maybe that's a me problem and I haven't progressed far enough to hit some kind of upgrade that lets you do that, but at this moment in my playtime I have not gotten that far yet. I do use overclocks as well, just to clear that up.

Verdict:
DRGS has a lot of potential to be a great Bulet Heaven game with more updates in the years to come, hopefully bringing more QOL features and upgrades to smooth out the rough edges. It's fun and I would recommended it on sale in its current state, but waiting for updates is also a fine idea as well.",1708627852,1708627852,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The Deep Rock galactic theme works well for it and it gets challenging.   There are quite a few things that will need to be addressed before it is ready for 1.0 but as an EA option it's nice. 
I especially like:
1. The digging theme works well
2. The specializations having targeted drop types is fun
3. The Deep Rock Theme actually improves this type of game by making it a race the feel like it makes sense.
4. The loop they have on each level is nicely laid out.

These are what I would like to see

1. More enemy types (basic, elite and bosses)
2. More Biomes and balance out the ones that are there (I feel the 3rd is easier than the 2nd)
3.  Some pacing changes would be nice. The game quickly becomes a grind (long before you reach the hardest levels)
4. The 4 classes make sense for the theme but more specializations would be nice, I'd especially like some tied to achievements rather than just playing a class over and over again.
5. More event types as you progress (beyond swarm and drop pod) maybe at higher difficulties.
6. More persistent unlocks would be nice.  Maybe some class customization options (like choose extra crit, speed, or dig) after specialization load out,  pick a few weapons that wont drop in a run.

When I play I generally do it for fun and not for 'a challenge' however I have about 1400+ hours on the normal DRG and generally play Haz3. With that being said, survivor is a new style of game I am unfamiliar with and it does have a learning curve to it. Essentially this is a single stick shooter / time survival game akin to 'vampire survivors' which I have never played. It does give me tower defense feels as well with the mining mechanic. 

Biomes are similar to the regular DRG series and most of your time is spend kiting enemies around while collecting XP in order to level up and earn weapon slots, artifacts, and mining minerals in order to spend them on 'upgrades' which are essentially permanent buffs. 

Upgrades (permanent buffs) can become quite expensive so you will largely find yourself farming haz1/haz2 missions for minerals as those are the most manageable. Haz3 you can still farm but Haz4 is virtually useless as the spawns are too large and too fast to focus on anything but survival. Upgrades seem useful in Haz1/2/3 but do not pack a punch at Haz4/5. 

During each mission run, you are leveling up, and each time you will see a menu to upgrade your weapon, improve mining speed, movement speed, health, etc. Some are common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary. It is largely luck based and you can also reroll using gold if needed. How you do during your runs largely depends on the upgrades you use. I think I have my permanent luck buff upgraded but it still seems like I receive a lot of common upgrade options rather than more epic or legendary. Again, this will affect how well your mission goes and if you win or lose. 

Artifacts are also small buffs that arrive via supply pods that drop during each round of a mission. There are 5 rounds with the final one ending with a battle against a Dreadnought. Most need to be unlocked via simple assignments such as 'collect 250 gold', etc. Again, artifacts seem to help at the lower levels but Haz4/5 they do not pack much punch. 

Overclocks can be earned for your weapons but you must first unlock the weapon, then unlock each weapon's overclock by leveling the weapon to 12, and then you can finally use the overclocks. Some are better than others and you will find what works best. 

Class Mods for the dwarves are unlocked as you level up as well, and you will find some are more useful than others. I find myself using Recon Scout and Foreman Driller most of the time as they have a reasonable movement/dodge/mining speed though the armor grease artifact does help dodge/mitigate some damage done by bugs, though I still feel all dwarves should have some inherent dodge capability even if it was 10%. 

Additional thoughts on the current build that I as a casual gamer would like to see implemented as it can be daunting for some. 
- Lower damage done by bugs as it seems quite high.
- Weapons (even with overclocks) can seem ineffective at Haz4/5. 
- Haz4 can be manageable at times but it still seems there are too frequent spawns, and your weapons, upgrades and artifacts do not seem to pack a punch to mitigate the waves of enemies
- Once you take on the Elite threat at the end of each level, Haz4/5 in particular it seems the threat level increases way too fast, and the waves just keep coming. It seems unmanageable especially in the earlier stages (1,2).
- Perhaps change when you unlock each weapon in order to mitigate this? Unlock 2nd weapon slot at 5, 3rd slot at 10, 4th slot at 20? 3rd is currently 15 and 4th is currently 25. 
- Default Movement speed / Mining speed seem extremely slow at the start, perhaps 50% increase? The only dwarf that seems capable of mining is the Foreman Driller at higher levels. 

With that being said, the game is very polished for an early access title, and the graphics are amazing. I realize that in it's current build things will need some balancing but overall I have been enjoying myself even though I find the higher hazard difficulties frustrating. I hope that they end up aligning the hazard levels more in line with DRG so that we casual gamers can take full advantage of what the game has to offer and not find ourselves frustrated at not being able to 'complete' the game as it were. Thanks!

Individual levels are smaller than others in the genre, but with more focused objectives. You'll have side objectives and resources to gather, which will keep you moving and exploring around the level - digging paths as you go. 
Being able to dig through the environment enables you to set up choke points and set up escape paths for yourself.
After finishing your main objective, you'll need to head to the drop pod pretty quickly (30s) before being moved to the next stage - so you'll want to finish gathering/side objectives before this. This adds some risk/reward factor as you can try to quickly grab what you can at the risk of outright failing the run by missing the drop pod.

Overall definitely a solid foundation with a lot of potential, at a reasonable price point. I had fun with it as is, but do look forward to seeing what future updates bring.

🚀 The premise is simple yet thrilling: dive deep and survive waves of relentless alien bugs using a vast arsenal of weapons. But, oh, it's so much more than that! The game is exceptionally accessible, making it easy to jump in but hard to put down. 🎉

🔫 The progression system is where ""Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor"" truly shines. There's a plethora of weapons and overclocks to unlock, not to mention the satisfying meta progression that keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. It's a game that respects your time and investment, offering loads of content and excitement. 💥

💰 I've spent more money on games that offered far less amusement. The value here is undeniable. Plus, the developers' commitment to supporting their games without additional costs is commendable. It's a business model that deserves support, especially from the younger gaming crowd. 👍

🐛 In conclusion, whether you're a veteran of the genre or a newcomer, ""Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor"" offers a compelling, action-packed experience that's easy to pick up but offers deep (pun intended) and rewarding gameplay. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a blast of fun! 💣

If you are a fan of the survival roguelike genre then you’ll enjoy your time with this game! Despite being in early access, I ran into no problems throughout my time obtaining all achievements and doing many, many runs. You can expect your character to start out fairly weak in your initial couple runs but as you upgrade your stats and weapons, you really start seeing progression. There are a ton of weapons you can unlock by completing challenges and leveling up characters. There are currently three biomes (maps) that you can play, each with different hazard levels (difficulties) to challenge you as you boost your character’s stats. Overclocking your weapon is a sick feature that helps push you to deeper stages in the run while also customizing the weapon to your playstyle. I know in their content roadmap, more artifact airdrops are in the works as well as new maps to play which will be great. There is a ton of content that Funday Games wants to keep adding to the game so it will be cool to see it develop over the coming months. The achievements were fun to obtain, with you having to do dedicated runs to obtain one or two at a time. Overall it was a great experience, the only grindy achievement was the ”Big Spender” achievement, but I just threw on some Youtube and kept doing run after run. Great game for a great price, and it stays true the Deep Rock Galactic theme by having you focus on mining resources while managing the hordes of enemies around you. Can’t wait to see what is added in the future!

Pros:
Cheap
Unique playstyle compared to other reverse bullet hell games (digging, drop pod, extraction etc.)
Each class/subclass offers unique gameplay and attributes/passive
A lot of interesting weapons with (some) fun overclock upgrades
A lot of things to aim for (subclass, weapon, overclock, artifact unlocks)
Runs well so far for an EA game

Cons:
Start out slow - scout with their starting scrappy weapon is quite weak, makes you want to pull your hair out
Demand that you upgrade your main weapon to max out 3 overclock asap or you'll get overwhelmed early
Many overclocks are just basic stat boost - less interesting and game changing compared to original DRG
No unique skills for each class (no zip line, grappling hook, platform etc.)
Balance still needs adjustment - if you have poor luck the first 2 stages, might as well give up

Even with all the issues, for just 9 bucks I can see myself returning to the game over and over for a few runs each day. With more contents in the roadmap, time will tell how this game turns out.

Why not unlock them when you unlock the weapon ? Additonally the overclock upgrades for most (not all) weapons feel VERY uninspired. More fire rate and less reload speed ? yawn. 
Mid mission there are supply drops, you then have to clear the zone and get some artifact. Problem is: the artifacts are mostly pretty lame and sometimes I don't even bother to get them as you might as well spend your time mining and getting resources instead.

The only downsides I feel are not helping the gameplay loop is balancing...This is in early access so I expect them to change some things but here is my problems...
First off the Exploder bugs need some kind of ring that shows up when they get too close or a visual indicator, it is too dam annoying when you get hit for like 2.5x the normal dmg of bugs from them and there are tons of visual effects covering the screen from explosions or blending into the bug mosh pit or the lava level, impossible to see them and then sometimes it feels like they explode instantly near you with no warning. Maybe change when you kill them it has the same visual warning they explode as well, instead of instant because there is no way to tell what their hp is and it is hard enough keeping track of all the bugs around you.
Secondly, HAZ 1 and 2 are are too hard...they are beginning levels not start playing tryhard or well I got screwed on upgrade rng so now I hit like a wet noodle so I guess I will get overrun (consistently). I mean I am even going hard min/maxing time spent mining and killing while exploring the map to get secondary done and I am still losing quite a bit. It is too dam aggravating when that happens ON LEVEL 1 and 2, Haz 3 I would expect it to start being hard like in the original game. I would probably fix this by increasing the exp gain and very slightly increase all damage giving you faster access to good gear to make it fair. I mean most starting bugs should just be one shot-able and then slowly get more hp or something.
Overall a great game though, I am enjoying it besides the bs that sometimes happens like with exploders or level generation making a weird plateau making it impossible to get around a swarm sometimes.",1708599956,1708601005,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The overclocks are mundane, you constantly have to run from the bugs, because they are always too strong (while having to stay still to mine), but most unforgivably, the game balance is off. You have to play and fail, over and over, to build up the meta, so you can survive longer next time.

It's a bit of a slog, but it needn't be. Hopefully, it just needs some tweaks. For example, I wish each level boss dropped a magnet, so the player auto-picked up all the XP on the level, as you don't have enough time to pick it up once the 30-seconds-to-get-out timer starts. Also, the post-boss rush back to extraction needs to be easier. I've killed the final boss THEN died more often than I have killed the final boss and got back for extraction. 

The game this mimics, Vampire Survivors, was fun, because you won often, but by the skin of your teeth, and in lots of different ways. Here, you just die, over and over again, gradually accruing points to give you X percent more hitpoints, or do Y percent more damage.

Its also really hard so keeps you coming back to try and beat the levels.

Really enjoying it! and considering the price I can't fault it",1708600707,1708600707,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There's not actually that many new lines, at least ones that pop up often, and the gameplay is a significantly shallower version of Vampire Survivor.

One of the biggest criticisms I have is that IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH WAY YOU'RE FACING, at least for weapons. Your dwarf can shoot right out of his bumhole while mining in the complete opposite direction. Vampire Survivor is actually a bit better in that some weapons, knives, etc actually fire in the direction you're facing. Just feels like fairly brainless gameplay.

Gear balance is all over the place, some stuff is really good some of it is borderline unusable (to be expected from early access to be fair) Movement speed buffs are way under powered, and the game is currently way too hard. Haz 1 is basically impossible to clear until you have a good few hours or more of upgrades, which feels really bad in practice. Nothing like getting swarmed to death where there's nothing you could've done. The game also has no upper limit on enemy spawns, so you can easily end up in a situation where (thanks to the 30 second time limit on the pod) you beat the boss and then die trying to get to the pod because there's actually 500 enemies blocking your path with no time to kite them out of the way... or die to the boss itself because you have nowhere to go to dodge its attack. 
The targeting AI is also horrific, grenades are pretty well unusable thanks to the AI cherry picking random stragglers instead of aiming for crowds, and unless your gun has specific targeting rules getting it on the target you want is a rough time.
All that said, the game is VERY fun, has that great Deep Rock aesthetic and sound, and is pretty addicting. A bit more content and some SERIOUS balancing, and there's something very special here, especially for the price tag. ",1708129193,1708598080,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Funday Games has expertly adapted the Deep Rock Galactic themes and mechanics. Faithful to DRG with fun bullet-heaven versions of the weapons familiar to DRG regulars.

The deep-dive mechanic (in this case, complete 5 mine levels to succeed at a run) gives a clear objective for each run, with various random goals tossed in. DRG Survivor improves on survivor-likes by giving you meaningful early run gameplay = mining! Time-pressure on each stage provides delicious tension between maxing XP and mining or surviving to the next stage. Cumulative unlockable buffs typical of a rogue-lite - love the inclusion of the mineral market!

If you like Diablo's perspective, Vampire Survivors' grind-pickup-upgrade-bullet heaven cycle, and DRG's mining features, aesthetic and attitude, then you will absolutely love this title - even in EA.

The basics are there: you get dropped down onto each planet at level 1 (I'm not sure how this is explained lorewise, maybe some initiative from the Corporation), mine for materials to upgrade, carry out company objectives, and then slay the big baddy while fighting off occasional swarms of creepy crawlies. Then get back to your dropship with your loot before the time runs out. DRG fans will find this second nature.

Either finish all of the depths at the point or die trying. Once you do, you can return to enjoy your new unlocks or spend your hard-mined materials to upgrade your Dwarf.

An important thing to remember with auto-shooter survival games - they're fun when you succeed, not when you die repeatedly to level.

Things that can be immediately fixed - 
• Decrease the blast radius for exploding bugs.
• Increase drop pod timers to 1min, let us loot!
• Increase Nitra/Gold spawns or fix the mechanism that places them, they are 
  sometimes non-existent.
• SLOW DOWN the stage timer, don't weigh kills so heavy that you get 3x swarms at once.
• Fix/remove lava - you shouldn't have to stand in lava to mine important 
  resources or clear a supply pod LZ...
• Unlock overclocks WHILE you're playing the weapon for the 1st time.  It's not fun leveling a 
  weapon that you can't make useful just to die and use it again.
• Power-ups need adjusting - weapon leveling should be separate from all other power-ups.  Power-ups are too slow for how one-dimensional they are when weapon levels are thrown in with stat increases.
• Late game boss swarms are out of control, you get overrun too fast.
• Buff overclocks, 25% firerate/reload is a joke and can be done with a couple power-ups.

There's a lot of work to be done with this.  They're clearly going for Vampire Survivors (VS) + DRG, but they're not quite there as far as the balance between progression:difficulty (over 100 hours of Vampire Survivors here).  There's too much resetting/dying just to slowly progress vs. a game like Vampire Survivors that nailed waves and farming a map before ending the match.  Enemy burst damage is too punishing, you can go from full health to dead in your final match, just by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  For a wave-based survival game with rounds lasting this long, you shouldn't be able to drop instantly - the blast radius on the explosion bugs needs some adjusting...  Though I marked this as not recommended, it's VERY close to being a decent game, but this seems like alpha, definitely not beta and certainly not 'early access' (not sure why we replaced beta with early access).  I'll continue to support these guys, but there's a lot of polishing ahead.

Only 3 maps, 4 characters, it gets stale pretty quickly.  No clear definitions on currency/xp earned in different maps/hazard levels.  I'll try to edit this as I play, but off the bat VS provides easier roaming/movement and more satisfying/more power-ups.  This game is trying too hard to remain tit-for-tat with DRG but that's not exactly going to work in this type of gameplay - they need to mix things up.  It feels like the overall design of this game, was 'repeatedly fail to win' rather than 'succeed to win' which is arguably less fun.  A game like VS keeps you hooked with wanting to experiment with unique power-ups/characters that perform very unique actions, whereas this game is trying to just paste in items from a FPS which do not translate over to an auto-shooter in the same exciting way 'magical' power-ups would.  You get some guns that shoot in different directions, and can increase damage, fire rate, critical damage, etc.  Nothing really exciting there.  But it can work - if you're going to stick to less-exciting power-ups/items, you really need to emphasize the mining aspect of the game.

Some classes are outright useless despite intended purpose - the juggernaut for Gunner for example.  This gains weapon damage when getting hit, and it stacks/runs out, so you're clearly meant to be a tank that gets hit for damage boost (especially with the short weapon range).  This is countered by ""higher"" armor which is laughably minuscule and becomes worthless on anything hazard 3+. It seems some classes were 'built' outside of actual gameplay and never tested.

The power-ups in general need some serious work - everything is way too one dimensional.  In my opinion, either weapon level ups should be in a separate mechanic than stat power-ups, or leveling needs to be quicker (or rounds need to be longer).  The reason I say this, is the game seems to revolve around overclocks and leveling weapons, however you're LUCKY to get 2 weapons max leveled in a dive - this is not very fun and very one dimensional.  I think of VS where you can (and are encouraged to) max out every weapon you have, and evolve every single one before a match ends.  Then, I think of this game where in a dive you're only going to max 2 weapons yet we're given 4?  You never feel like you're building a REAL build in this game, you're just rushing to max level 1 weapon which in turn results in ignoring all the other stat power-ups.  This game would be way more fun if we could actually get all 4 weapons max leveled, while also enjoying passive power-ups.  Ultimately, the power-up system is very vanilla, there's no nuance to it, and it's extremely one dimensional - pick a primary weapon, choose those power-ups every time they appear, ignore all else.

The game's design seemingly contradicts itself at times.  It appears they're going for a more grind/farm heavy VS gameplay, yet they rush you WAY more than a game like VS that lets you really take your time and get your character built up in each round.  You get swarms while swarms are still active, you get no time to actually mine yet they're urging you to mine for between-stage power ups but rush the end stage objective on you and keep hammering you with swarms preventing you from doing so, then when you're at the final objective they keep powering up the remaining enemies, again, rushing you to complete it.  For example, if you build up a really powerful character early in the round, you'll mow down swarms and while doing so, it progresses the round and throws you into the next swarm, then it's over - you won't have any time to farm anything if you're accidentally TOO strong...I literally hit 3 swarms without moving from 1 spot before because I made my character too strong, then I was at the end of the round, fun.  When it's finally over, your drop pod timers are insanely short, what was the reason for this?  There are way too many farming/mining elements to the gameplay for how much they're rushing you, it doesn't feel good, I don't feel like I'm able to enjoy powering up my build at a reasonable pace.

I've finally been able to make SLIGHT progress, and unfortunately it only highlights more negatives within this game.  To really become powerful and complete higher hazard levels, you have to focus on ONLY 1 weapon from the very beginning.  This means you have to rely on RNG to give you power-ups for just that 1 weapon and if you don't have enough gold to re-roll or don't get lucky with the power-ups, only getting upgrades for your secondary, you will fall behind and will not be able to get the overclocks required for completing later stages and might as well quit/start over (not to mention you can get screwed on overclocks and have to salvage, i.e. quit the run).  This not only discourages build diversity, but it heavily leans into the RNG aspect.  Basically if you don't level 1 weapon quick enough, you will fall behind the progression requirements.  In a game like VS, I've had horrible RNG yet can still pull through and get a build suitable for beating the stage halfway through - in this game, if you get bad RNG a couple times, you may as well just restart.  Ultimately, the progression in this game is starting to feel more like a chore and less enjoyable with each death.  My interest is slowly waning and they're not doing enough to keep me hooked.

Well after 24 hours I'm calling it quits at hazard 3.  This is just not fun at this point, grinding the same maps, same characters, same stale weapons, getting halfway through just to die to some bad positioning and over-swarms (and mostly explosion bugs - for real, fix these).  I'll check in after it releases, but hopefully they listen to the negative reviews and make proper adjustments.",1708140290,1708569793,False,1,0,0.470588237047195435,0,True,False,True

Many complain about the difficulty, but honestly guys, stop playing while drooling over your keyboards and be serious for two minutes.

Difficulty is the basis of this game. You have to know how to grind like a degenerate, spending several hours on the same levels to finally be able to improve the skill levels which will then be used to tear everything away once in the game. It's all about strategy and patience. If you have this, you will be rewarded very quickly. If you don't have it, you will get stuck at the first level like 90% of people apparently... :')

Because of this the future looks more promising. Currently, thrifty spenders should heed the negative reviews, since there are plenty of valid criticisms of the build depth and enemy variety in a genre which has been around for awhile now. 

That being said, there is a good amount of polish and improvement from the demo version they released previously. Much like the game its spinning off from, the crown jewel of DRG:S is the level generation and manipulation. You essentially are given a small board with randomized hazards, blockades, and mineral deposits that you need to weave through a growing horde of bugs trailing you like a game of Snake. The game has a much tighter and frantic pace than Halls of Torment or Vampire Survivors due to this tighter, arena-like level design and that feels great. The audio and visuals are also a pretty big step up compared to most survivor games and it runs solid on a Ryzen 1800X and RX 6600. The smaller scope as it stands currently also seems to keep it from approaching near unplayable frame dips like Halls of Torment end-game has succumbed to.

As for things I'd like addressed aside from the obvious, the added arsenal to the dwarves that isn't present in the main game is actually pretty cool, but I hope they take another leap for the survivor genre and add movement specialties that are present from the utility slots of the co-op horde shooter. Essentially, expect a grappling hook, expect repellant or spongy platforms that synergizes with grenade launcher hopping, ziplines to travel over obstacles or avoid hits from smaller grunts... The driller is actually great as is, good job.

Dynamic environmental effects like sandstorm and seismic activity would also be great to see. Don't forget the ice stalactites — which are present in Halls of Torment.

The way they prevented the meta progression from being able to refund points I'm not a HUGE fan of, either. I hope they follow the genre norm of allowing you to mix and match the meta elements at will as they unlock through your career point/resource total. Halls of Torment's loot system is a good thing to take reference from. The ideal way to progress through the game currently is to prioritize xp gain, since many of the hazard unlock challenges require reaching weapon level milestones which are fairly dependent on chance to attain, even if you start with the weapon required to level. The idea being that while you may not survive the run due to being caught off guard or backed into a corner, you will have at least checked off the weapon level challenge - this is also how overclocks are unlocked (which can't be immediately used in that run in-game, another annoying delaying tactic currently present).

In short game feels good to play. Maybe it released into early access a little too early content wise, but there's more potential given the good launch. I'd maybe recommend Halls of Torment or Vampire survivors as your introduction to the genre, since they have more compelling build opportunities and learning curves currently, but if you want another survivor game for your collection and love DRG, this is a solid buy at $10.

The classes are distinct, the weapons are fun, and the unlockables are rewarding.

Balancing should be the priority as of now ( Make everything like the Thunderhead pls that thing made the game much easier and mor enjoyable)",1708561440,1708561440,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

In terms of a Bullet Heaven/Survivor-like style game, DRG: Survivor comes so close to scratching that niche and easily having me sink 100's of hours into.

Main gripe with the game boils down to the ludicrously short round lengths. Within the span of 5 minutes you have :
1. Primary objective (General survivor-like gameplay loop of kill/kite/level)
2. Secondary Objective (Varying fetch quests which force you too explore/mine)
3. Supply Pod (Random capture zone which you need to mine/clear)
4. Mining for resources (Gold/Nitra currency for in between stage purchasing and varying minerals needed for post run upgrades)
You rinse/repeat 5 times before fighting the final boss which is a massive health sponge that if you don't dodge its windup, will easily 2/3 shot you. The general lack of hit box transparency makes the game feel extremely unfair (Final Boss pounce, exploding enemies AoE, static map hazard mobs attacks, shooters, etc...) when you're entire screen is filled with mobs while keeping track of the various other objectives needed to progress the game. With short runs, conflicting progression elements, and general grind elements, DRG: Survivor comes out to feel fairly frustrating.

I came to play a DRG : SURVIVOR. Expecting a DRG set dressed Survivor-clone, not a Hades on Max Torment in the second difficultly modifier. Post game upgrades are linear while the costs are exponential, forcing you be in a constant struggle with which maps drop which minerals for a certain upgrade you want. And if your early game RNG isn't on point with in run upgrades, you will quickly be out scaled be mobs by the third stage if you aren't completing every single objective.

The game is still in Early Access, but difficulty and certain quality of life features that survivor-likes have seem to be vacant from this title. Some suggestions : 
1. Re-balance Hazard levels/scaling : Hazard 1 is decently challenging for an early account, one with little to no post game upgrades, but I shouldn't be needing to already grind for these upgrades in Hazard 2-3.
2. Tweak in game events : This game genre isn't popular for its speed run category. Either lengthen time between events to give the player ample time to prepare for the upcoming events or add a downtime phase to give the same effect.
3. Increase Invulnerability Frames upon taking damage or add a Dodge Roll in the form of a jet boost.
4. Don't lock other classes behind account level : Either make them base choices, keeping their overclock/class augments needing dedicated playtime to access, or if you want to keep them as earnable characters akin to other survivor-likes, tie them to a achievement befitting that class. (I.E ""400% attack speed to unlock Gunner"")
5. Reroll/Banish system : Make rerolls their own currency you can play around with, instead of costing gold, a currency you need for post game progression or in run upgrades. Make them their own post game upgrade or tie their amount to upgrades akin to Vampire Survivor. Likewise with Banishes and make these systems work with overclocks.
6. Multiplayer : The most demanding of the requests which would solve a lot of the issues. Following the balance of DRG, tie difficulty to the amount of players currently in run, toss modifiers into the the game for the solo-sadists, and the demanding action economy of DRG: Survivor is all but mediated.",1708557192,1708557192,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Much like Vampire Survivors, there are elements of it that are under your control and you actually get more agency over the fight as you unlock more upgrades.

DRG is funny because some of the things that the dwarf says are dark humor - but with the recent updates - a lot of DRG fan are negatively complaining about the audacity of FunDay to take charge and unnessarily censored and change our beloved game.

So until they revert that or put some kind of voice filter - I will change my review to NEGATIVE and will not be playing DRG Survivors (its a fun game but when they mess up with your favorite IP - believe me DRG Survivor is not that excellent of a game enough to motivate us to play when essentially they are changing the stuff that we love.

I think that Ghost Ship should take that into consideration - because if Ghost Ship started to change the content of DRG to appease these woke snowflakes - I will not be supporting this franchise anymore. It is the crass humor that gets a chuckle out of me every now and then.

-----------------------------------------------------

Played for 2.5 hours and before the 2/20 censorship:

This is an excellent extension to DRG franchise although it plays very differently. I think the Survivors type of game needs some adjustment or getting used to (since you only control the movement) - just like the original Survivor game - it takes some time to start especially when you have to farm for basic power up. Once you get to a point where you have enough default power up then this game starts to get really exciting and it brings a new meaning to carnage.

It is pretty awesome that the usual DRG bantering are incorporated into this game. I am still exploring this game but so far it is pretty awesome. I also think that this game is more balanced that the original Vampire Survivors (but then the game is a bit different). I am looking forward to many hours of gameplay and exploration.

Mining and resource collecting puts a nice, but small, spin on the Vampire Survivor formula. You always have something to do and there's a lot of moment to moment planning. Good stuff. 

A lot of people are talking about the balance, which is indeed iffy, and the lack of content. I'm pretty confident they will fix the balance and add more content. That being said, the game has some problems that are a bit more baked-in, such as the isometric perspective. On all three stages currently available it frequently hides enemies behind terrain, and on the 3rd stage Hollow Bough, I found myself frequently taking damage because the dark brown of the map blended together with the black used to signify impassible pits. The 3D look is nice, but is nothing but a drawback when it comes to gameplay. 

A smaller problem is also the amount of grinding you need to do: a new weapon needs to be used and upgraded in a underpowered state before you unlock the ability to make it powerful. What makes this even worse is if the run ends before you managed to sink enough upgrades into it to make the unlock, then you just played a underpowered run for no reason. This feels bad and I can not see any reason for it other than to pad playtime, which is not something a 10 EUR game should care about. 

It's still a thumbs up because there's clearly enough good stuff here to justify 10 EUR. Just don't expect it to be the same kind of home-run normal DRG is, at least not yet.

The Visuals, lighting and aesthetic are absolutely delightful to look at. (God i love looking at magma core)
The Weapon visuals, effects, and particles all look great, and while later in the game it can get really cluttered with both the amount of enemies and weapon effects going on, if you know the vampire survivor genre its no less cluttered than other similar games and you learn to love it.

The mining is an absolute joy and satisfying, i love watching the Glyphid's walk around the environment to try to get to you, or the bigger enemy's dig through it themselves. Mining minerals is delightful and mining tunnels to funnel enemies or panic dig in an attempt to escape getting surrounded is a wonderful rush.

The enemy variety is fine, plenty of things to kill and nothing super annoying to absolutely body you out of nowhere, if your getting surrounded you can feel it happening and usually find a means of getting out. Also bating exploders and chaining them to kill hoards is my favorite pastime now :)

I think the weapons of DRG have been implemented wonderfully, and while at time of writing i think i only have a little over half the weapons unlocked they are all a pleasure to use. While some of them feel similar each other or are a little hard to get the feeling of at first they all have their place, and the Overclock system floored my expectation from the beta and are a highlight when you max them out.

The classes have also been implemented really well, each having 3 sub classes with different buffs and starting weapons for good variety, and depending on which class you choose will depend on the guns you'll find in game with some periodic overlap (Foreman driller FOR THE WIN LEMMI DIGGY DIGGY HOLE)

Progression is gradual, yeah at first a 5-10% buff to something doesn't feel like its helping too much, but stack that buff 8 times and get better buffs ranging from 25% to 50% and stack that even further with Overclocks that range from a bit better to KILL EVERYTHING and your 3 other weapons that you're also overclocking and upgrading, oooooooh things gonna get EXPONENTIAL IN HERE! The meta progression is fine if a little slow, though the Ore Store from DRG is clever and gives a use to unused gold, personally i like it, it compliments the ""in round progression"" rather than being the main focus.

The end of match boss fights are fine, if you're high enough level and got a good build they're nothing to worry about, though so far its been the same boss at the end of every mission, id probably ask to have other variants, basically the same but with different attack sets to set them apart from the current one. But as it stands the boss endings are just fine if a bit repetitive after the 5th go at them.

Personally I hope this game gets a number of updates for quality of life fix's like the boss's, but realistically if they said this game was finished, i think it has enough to be 100% worth the 10$. And while there's an argument that Vampire survivors is only 5$ ""Why buy this when you can just get that"", that's fair and a completely reasonable argument I personally have both because I feel they're different enough to justify owning them both, and upfront, 10$ is pretty good for the playtime you'll have with this game, and I would personally still buy this game 7 times over than buy ""Skull and Bones""",1708544410,1708544410,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,True

-eye strain from all the shacking the same does why no setting to disable

-yes its a survivor game but were the other objectives like i would like if we had to defend  a drill or cleanup mission meteor strikes etc its very repetitive
-were the coop i would love to have my group of friends with me
-only 3 maps which all feel the same

Game starts off great and has a tier difficulty 1-5 that you progressively unlock as you play. Game really starts to show its early access issues by tier 3+ difficulty where there are balance issues.

The warthog shotgun weapon does not autotarget nearby enemies like every other weapon does which is a very strange design choice considering how small and how much maneuvering you need to do in this game. It's an extremely frustrating experiencing using this weapon while playing with a keyboard because aiming is done exclusively with WASD - very frustrating. The strategy seems to be to build a tunnel choke point and just stand there and blast in front of you with this specific weapon once you get your character into a decent position but then if you have enemies that are flying or a flying elite it negates this strategy.

I would say vampire survivors is a much less frustrating game to play simply because there is no mining nodes in vampire survivors. Imagine vampire survivors where you have to stop and mine a node for a few seconds in order to make your weapons stronger, that's basically the game. When you fail a run in vampire survivors its because of bad RNG which happens in any roguelite, when you fail a run in this game its because it wasn't properly playtested.

Example:
Progression is tied to mining nodes in the game which give XP to level weapons but also gives gold/nitrate which you spend on upgrades, so you NEED to mine these to make your weapon stronger but you can't mine and fire at the same time with certain weapons that require WASD aim (warthog shotgun) So if you start kiting enemies or build a tunnel choke point, either the flying guys destroy you because you can't aim properly with WASD in a confined space or you kill everything too fast and end up with no gold/nitrate for upgrades between levels which you will not be able to progress forward on. This is because the faster you kill enemies the faster the boss is spawned for that level and enemies become stronger once the boss has spawned. Once the boss dies the level ends and you only have 30 seconds to board the drill before the next level. 

It's vampire survivors with mining on a ""timed"" level, if you can imagine vampire survivors where you need to stop to mine a node for a few seconds in order to get stronger. It doesn't really work at higher difficulty levels, sounds good on paper though.

What they should have done here was after the boss dies enemies continue to get stronger but you can board when you want (level doesn't end after 30 seconds) which would give you a chance to mine nodes that you've missed since the game has forced you to abandon them because you needed to kite - or you simply killed everything too fast because the game didn't allow you to mine (same difference). I think they did this as a nod to the original deep rock galactic game since that game had timed levels, but in this case it just doesn't work.",1708497266,1708543748,False,0,1,0.471698105335235596,0,True,True,True

I got angry, it was making me mad.
I cursed developers and I got banned.
And I found that this game is an early access.
Crashes reminded me nightmares of 'Diablo IV, MW III', it might be a trauma. Because they just crashed like Hell and I screamed a lot, it was too painful.
'Oh, why does this happen to me?'
I checked my system again, also the BIOS, reassembled some parts, ran 3DMark.
I found some people told about overclocking features caused crashes. I thought 'Oh, is this ASUS Performance Enhancement?' But it's on by default, also 'Intel Adaptive Boost Technology' is on by default.
I was just using default settings for my motherboard, because it must be fine, it is usually fine with defaults for most systems.
I tried to turn off one of them and checked my system again and again one by one.
I think 'ASUS Performance Enhancement' causes crashes for some games. It's my conclusion.
It's been just some hours testing, for now, at the moment, games didn't crash on my system. But I didn't try 'Diablo IV, MW III' yet, because I lost will to play those games, they were nightmares, I screamed many times when I encountered unacceptable crashes, I got tired and I feel sorry and I wonder why ASUS set BIOS like that. It just made me furious too much day by day and month by month.
I poured out my feelings and it caused troubles, problems, it damaged people.
Ah, how will ASUS think about this? Why, just why did they turn in on by default? My time, energy wasted too much, it wasted my life.
I hope there will not be many crashes again, really, because I've experienced enough, too many, a huge amount of numbers. It's OK to crash sometimes, it's acceptable, every game has errors, bugs, but not too many.

my opinion to this game is Following:
Overall is POSITIVE and game is recommendable for players that love survival games (or don't wanna play online / are in need to make adhoc pauses)

So far I have spend around 20h in this game, more like game play 12-15h or around 70 runs...

My feedback:

Plus:
- I LOVE the mining part, its something new to this game type :)
- Hero sub-classes 
- Unlocking system for weapons
- Multiple resources and the exchange of it in ""upgrades""/shop
... someone made his homework here! :)

Minus:
- Same boss with same skills on each floor :( -> we are open for more :) 
- Milestones (aka ""Achievements"") are confusing, please make filtering or something like that (in/-complete etc.)
- Minimap is ""useless"", because: 
-- Player  can see more in game (during game play) as on the minimaps - the range here like it is, its useless 
-- I dont have any way to see the whole floor aka ""level"", and player need it for better orientation ... like ... he went to far from station/drop location ... after its just out of reach and in rush its  getting confusing 
... please improve those for us :) 

I will continue to playing it and enjoying to explore the unknown so far:)

Thank You & Best Regards!

The classes all feel ""the same"".
The weapons all feel ""the same"".

Mining is an actual mechanic that you can use to your advantage, build for and is integral to both character and global upgrades, and a game of this genre with destructable environment is really a breath of fresh air.
Dwarbs have a lot of voicelines some of which I can't remember from DRG.
I like the art direction, which doesn't surprise me since DRG had a great one to begin with.
Same great soundtrack as DRG.
Pretty challenging so far early in the game, but doesn't feel straight out unfair, and I'm still on the low hazards. I reckon you will snowball really hard later on, but for now the balance between difficulty and straight up murder fun is pretty gamn good.

The only drawbacks I can think of is perhaps weapon variety might not satisfy some people, but so far it looks like weapons are not class locked and you can mix and match them freely no matter which class you choose to play, which expands the build variety (upon playing further I don't think that's the case for all weapons, some seems to be cross class while others are class specific). And bosco is pretty damn boring, they really should add Bosco specific upgrades and weapons which would also solve the potential weapon variety issue.

A classic voice line was removed from the game due to some rando complaining that their feelings were hurt.

Most of the meta progression is tied to mining special ores you can find on each map. These materials do not give any immediate progression for your run making it a risk to mine. (It ends up affecting the flow btw, but that's another subject). This is not really a problem in hazard 1, you can mine a good amount without sacrificing your run. But once you naturally reach hazard 2, the difficulty ramps up so fast, you have absolutely no time to farm the meta materials. Your only choice is to grind the easy difficulty until you're strong enough for hazard 2 which is not fun at all. One solution would be to add some run effect to the materials.

The second thing is weapon overclock. As you level weapon in a run, they will periodically give you a choice for a powerful overclock modification. The thing is when you first unlock a new weapon, it won't have the overclock available until you level it to 12+ in a run. And this overclock being so powerful, there is almost no way to succeed a hazard 2+ run without it. So what ends up happening is every time you unlock a new weapon you are forced to run a easy hazard 1 run, hope you get to choose that weapon and level it to 12 without the fun mods. You have to do this for every single weapon you unlock otherwise you just cannot progress. This is unnecessary grind just for the sake of it and sucks all the fun from the game. This limitation should just be removed from entirely. 

Another minor things is some monsters are just over-tuned. On the third planet for example, there are some bugs that can fly AND run faster than you. There is almost no tactics to defeat those, other than running in circle and hoping not to get overwhelmed. Also, some monsters are so spongy your only strategy is to hope your weapon AI targets the ""bomb bugs"" to make the horde explode. It almost makes it feel like weapon upgrades are irrelevant as long as you can target those. I would like to have better agency on what is happening and not rely so much on luck.

Yes, it's not as detailed/unique as the 20 other swarm/survivor games, but, it's fun and it is a new take. Is it better than Vampire Survivors ? not yet. It needs a little bit of tweaking to the formula / meta for it to be as simple and dynamically difficult, especially because it relies on stats to offset ramping difficulty waves and gear/tech tree options. As do most of the swarm/survivor games.

I'd expect there to be a few surprises added, but it's still early in development. If it goes live as it is, I don't think it would be worth the money in comparison. It needs a bit more flavour / tuning for the Meta. As it is, it's playable, but it could be improved as you gain access to new characters, new unlocks, etc. 

Having unlocked the 4 class types, they're uniquely fragile, and very different survivability. You can figure it out yourself... but the game strategy/meta is very rough. There's room to improve the meta, but It's enough for 20 hours of gameplay. You'll fail 5/10 runs if you don't have a good strat, and there's an upper limit on skill/tech. Unlocks are needed to gain the better gear to execute the chain/stacking of status/crit effects. It's very rough. But that's kind of the fun.

Reasons being the Scout class and its skills/upgrades is OP compared to the others. There isn't even a comparison. Also, the upgrades you do get, gets tedious very quickly (i.e + weapon damage/fire rate/crit rate). There also isn't much of a choice when getting new weapon slots, as some weapons, like the throwable bomb is infinitely better than the boomerang or any other upgrade. 

Levels are too short and enemy variety is lacking as well, which makes it become quite boring after a few hours. I guess the game is still in early access, but there's only 3 levels so far + a few difficulty modes. This game needs 30+ unique levels, each with different mechanics and ways to complete the level. At the moment, each level feels exactly the same as the one before it, so it becomes a boring slog.

 - The graphics are really good (imo) for the genre and I like the artstyle.
 - The mining and objectives are a nice addition and add some strategy to the gameplay
 - Every progression system is pretty cool.

The bad :
 - Aiming abilities should be a thing, or at least being able to direct them for all weapons.
 - Meta progression is incredibly slow/unimpactful. Every point should be at the very least noticeable.
 - Upgrades are unoriginal and the values don't match the genre of the game. It's not an MMORPG, it's THE genre where upgrades should be the most impactful. e.g. 2% movespeed is a talent in an MMO, not an upgrade in an auto shooter.
 - Weapons feel pretty bland, especially since upgrades are unoriginal and unimpactful.
 - Overclocks are what regular upgrades should basically be.
 - Best way to dispatch a swarm is actually not your own weapons, but making enemies suicide and take out a big part of the swarm with their explosion
To summarize the bad : Every upgrade is too unorignal/unimpactful for a genre whose only goal is to grow to insane power levels within a run, only matched by even crazier enemies.

Overall I feel like the game did an amazing job porting the DRG theme and adapting all mechanics to suit the auto shooter genre, showing great potential, but the moment to moment gameplay is not great.
I don't really want to play more currently, but I feel like the foundation is there to make it an amazing game.

Graphics are gorgeous & the gameplay loop pretty fantastic & certainly gets you hooked. The addition of mining as you play adds a wonderful new dimension to the genre.
As far as criticisms go, I have 2 & the first may rectify itself as I pour more time into the game or once it leaves early access & that first is in the upgrades, which are, by all means, SOLID, but aren't as inspired as the mining mechanic.
The second is in the maps. The one thing that RBHs offer you a sense of control over are in trusting your surroundings. Some may limit you in some way, say a limited vertical or horizontal border, but it's the one thing you tend to grasp firmly and can trust.
Here, it's not the walls you can mine thru, but rather the random dropoffs that act as barriers that can suddenly put an end to a great run when you make one bad choice in which way to head with a horde nipping at your heels. Perhaps, over playthrus, this will grow on me as part of DRGS' charm & world, but atm, it serves more as a sense of frustration. With my 2 faves being Vampire Survivors & Army of Ruin, perhaps I've grown too accustomed to open maps, or at least ones with limited barriers fencing me in.
But, DRGS is quickly becoming one of my faves in the genre, and these 2 small sticking points are ones others should be aware of before heading underground with our group of space dwarves.

The game sped up five-fold compared to the public test, which makes you fight against the timer rather than do anything else.

I would recommend this game to anyone, but keep in mind there are a few issues, not many in bugs but rather game play.

Suggestions?
More game modes, pleaseeee more game modes, there's only 1 game mode and its kill elite, kill elite again, kill it two more times and then kill the big baddie! This gets boring, fast. If anything, I would say play though the original DRG, and understand the various game mode types. You have 'oil' extraction, minehead platform mode, normal mining, escorting, repair minehead, and dreadnought hunt with various other modes like deep mining.

Another idea is to have an ability to have a survival mode, and add endless expanse, the grid is quite small, not a lot of space to move in.

Finally, I would recommend to have players to move at their own pace. What I mean by this is, when I kill the Elite, I should have the ability to continue the fight, or call in a drop pod. Currently, its once it is defeated, it's over, no time to collect or mine, just move on and you're done.

Oh and also, add Multiplayer if possible...

The game is fairly well balanced, with few weapons that I've experienced so far that seem like 'bad' choices.
The end boss is difficult, but once you get the hang of it doable.

I've heard complaints about this game and its mechanics, but whenever I actually looked into them they weren't actually valid. For instance I hear Asmongold complained at length about the fact that different styles of gameplay exist. (I haven't watched the full video, but I did skip through it, and he does make complaints about that subject, to what extent though I can't say.)
My friend tells me that his point was that he didn't like that the gunner has to look at the enemies to kill them, and arguesthat every class should have omni-directional firing.

But in my opinion the Scout is the most boring class, The Scout's gameplay is what I would consider genre generic gameplay, it's the same that you'd experience in something like Vampire Survivors for example, and that's why the scout is the first class. it's recognisable and easy to pick up regardless of whether you're a veteran or a new player. However the other classes focus on diversifying the gameplay, with each having a different and unique style and feel.
What this means is that this game really shines by make each class feel like a different experience, but not a worse experience.

For instance in my opinion from best to worst class you have Gunner>Engineer>Driller>Scout

>The Gunner's mechanics are very target orientated, you lose the ability to target everything in order to fire in a medium cone centered on your front, this means you can't fire at enemies while running which was Asmongold's issue but if you build him right you never need to run, everything in front of you dies. Swarms be damned, I fire more bullets than your species has members. 

>The Engineer is the play-easy class, effectively not needing to try very hard to get far because he can just throw around stationary auto-turrets, and have around 4 of them at once in my experience, Whenever you upgrade them they are no longer stationary, so you just have 4 auto turrets following you around while you mind your own business, any other weapons or artefacts you get in addition are a bonus but not very needed as the turrets are almost enough on their own.

>The Driller is a close-range class where the close-range is optional, obviously it does work better at close range but I managed to complete a run where I spent 100% of my time looking for ores to mine, basically their primary weapon is a pistol that shoots straight backwards. it's not powerful but it is consistent, this is the class that I find it's most important to choose the right weapons at the right times, however whenever you can easily rapid fire high-explosive grenades out your back ain't nothing getting close enough to disturb your gold fever.

>The Scout is a generic class, simply put just like in many games of this genre you can run, and it'll shoot generally around you. This means you don't need to worry about any advanced gameplay like timing, distance or radius, you just need to worry about positioning and escape routes. The scout does seem to fall off faster than the other classes but I'm also certain that changes based on what additional weapons you unlock. I'd say due to the early game power of the scout it has the potential to be the most powerful class if you can get and level the right weapons. But the gameplay isn't very complicated, or deep and there's a low skill entry for this class.

Now just because I am genuinely enjoying the game doesn't mean I don't see room for improvement, it is an early access game and there's certain to be changes to come.
>First off some visual detail but before you leave in the ship I think it'd be neat if APD-B317 was shown being loaded into the ship, or followed the ship into the hole. As of right now it just kind of sits there, and it's almost like the AI just turned off. it just kind of feels unfinished, like the devs didn't know what to do at this point.
That said, >>Early Access game<< and this polish was not required so it's completely understandable that it's not in the game, but it is something that every player will experience every time they play, so I think it's important to mention.

>Second off enemies in the game are divided into three categories: Crawlers, Flyers, and Stationary. The issue with this however is that there's not really any variety within these groups as every enemy is just ""Crawler who also:"" with there being an exploding one, and a ranged one. But other than that there isn't much variety.
I'd suggest adding in Unique enemies with a smaller spawn rate, make Praetorians that will use their radiation breath, or create areas of radiation to restrict player movement, Mactera uniques may have the ability to fly into the sky, and descend at another location of the map, making it difficult to predict where they'll be.
Grunts and slashers may have unique forms that move slightly faster, or which have the ability to jump similar to the dreadnought, and the spitter uniques may have the ability to break walls with their spit, attacking you from areas you haven't mined out and making tunnels for the other Glyphids to chase you through.
Additionally unique lootbugs may drop sugar red, or rarely an upgrade / magnet.

I am certain that i haven't experienced the full extent of the game just yet, but this is something that I want to already be in it in later stages, or would like to be added at some point. Just rare uniques that can turn runs on their head, and threaten to force a more creative approach to situations.

>Third off I'd recommend adding more terrain variety, right now whilst the world is filled it's feeling like a tutorial for each of the environment types. for instance in the magmatic levels you have... magma... Who could have seen that coming? But joking aside adding background details like destroyed and torn apart M.U.L.E.s, shut down escape pods, and stationary turrets with small amounts of ammo can liven up the experience. Additionally I'd recommend adding mining explosives that can be found rarely in levels, allowing you to pick up say a barrel that looks similar to a oxygen tank, and then with left click, or space bar your dwarf can lob it, the explosive detonating on impact. You could have voicelines like ""For Karl!"" or ""Take That!"", or ""Is this where all the Flintlocke's goin'?""
Finally on that note also adding in terrain, or structures of rival companies which would also leave the possibility for the rival of some waves to be the units from rival companies, which in turn could have ranged abilities causing the player to have to go on the offensive instead of the defensive playstyle that's generic in this genre.

>Fourth off this is a small detail, but it would be nice to have some level of customisability, it doesn't need to be anything big but it is a massive factor of DRG so it'd be nice to see it in DRG:S, now because the model is so small I'm thinking having two player customisation options, and the majority of customisation being based around the APD-B317 and ship.
For the dwarf: having a hat/helmet customisation, and an armour customisation because those would be the easiest things to see from the player's perspective.
The APD-B317 customisation is obvious as I think we all need a Cyber Ninja watching our backs.
However I also thing customising the drop ship visually, by changing colour and minor aspects like the lighting, type of drill it has and perhaps visual cosmetics around it would be nice.
A really simple cosmetic that would be amazing to see in the game would be like how irl race cars have company logos on them, but with the beers.",1708479141,1708497923,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

As a early access game it definitely needs more polishing, for example weapons need better balance and waves feel too rushed, more importantly the weapon overclock unlock system is not fun to play (see [i][b]Note[/b][/i]).
If you are a fan of the original game I would recommend this game at its current state.
If you are just a fan of the Vampire Survivors genre I would suggest waiting a bit longer for this game to become more polished.

1. The maps and dives are too similar to each other. The waves are always the same, in the same order, at the same time. VS has the same order of waves at the same times, but each map has different enemies that act differently. Sure, each one has enemies that fill the same role such as bats, floating skulls, and dust elementals, but they look different, act different, and spawn different. In DRGS you have like 5 or 6 different enemies, stronger versions of those enemies, and boss versions of those enemies and they all spawn in large groups and take the shortest path directly to you, on all three maps, in all five difficulties. And the “gimmicks” with each map are minor annoyances at best, and the floor layout is spawned the same way. VS has wide open maps, thin horizontal, thin vertical, wide open with large obstacles, and things in-between. There is no incentive to choose a different map in DRGS. VS’s maps have different difficulties, different enemies, and unique items on the ground that you can pick up for free. 

2. Weapons and upgrades are not balanced. There are weapons that are 100% better than others and there are weapons that are 100% worse than others. While certain weapons in VS are better than others, all of them are viable without having to get a very specific build and very specific upgrades. The weapon I have the biggest gripe about is the turret that the engineer starts with on his basic kit. You have to stand still to deploy it. The engineer throws it away from himself to deploy it. The turret targets the enemy closest to it itself. Every single time I stop moving to deploy turrets, a bug gets close enough to attack me. Every single time the turret gets deployed, the closest enemy to it is not the one attacking me, and with how few immunity frames you get after taking damage, I continue to get hurt. So I start moving to get away from the bugs, but I am also running away from my turret so it can no longer target the enemies closest to me. I also can no longer place a new turret because I am moving. Do you see what the problem is here? You need incredibly specific high tier upgrades in order to make the turrets viable.  And its over clocks are just as useless as it is. You can have the turret follow you at about a 50 yard distance, or you can have it’s bullets break walls which I don’t feel like I need to explain that one, or you can have the turret blow up at the end of it’s life doing very minimal damage that has harsh ramping and a miniscule AOE, or you can get a generic one like changing its damage type or a low increase in stats. It is important to note that the upgrades for the weapons are random both in stat increase and amount of the increase. I have died because the upgrades I got were for the wrong stat or were too low. I have seen VS like games pull off random upgrades, namely Soulstone Survivors. But VS offers the same stat increase for each level of its weapons, and instead offers the general stat increases as separate items that can also be leveled. 

3. The different characters are too similar. Each class and sub-class have different stat boosts and abilities that are minimal, useless, and sometimes even detrimental. Each class is also limited to specific weapons and start with one specific weapon. And like I said previously, some of them suck. VP characters each start with a specific weapon, but are open to get any other weapon in the game and any other item in the game. 

I got distracted while writing this so I forgot exactly what else I was going to say but I think this covers the most of it. There is not enough variation between maps and characters, and weapons and upgrades are not balanced. I also recommend reading other reviews as some of them also cover other annoyances.

The unlock system is maybe a bit restrained but i can see how it encourages a lot more play through looking for new gun combinations; So the way it works is you find a new gun then you need to upgrade 12 times before it unlocks the ""tier'd"" augment system on them so every 5 or so i think it is unlocks a big ""fires more waves, or reload speed 100% faster, or becomes ""x"" damage type. 

Now the issue with this is mainly that COOL I FOUND THIS NEW GUN! but... i cant really play it until after I've finished a run with it hitting 12 upgrades, which means that you really cant get the most out of it by a considerable margin AND you may not even get to the 12 unlocks if you found it late enough into a run, so that feels a bit bad at times.

The maps can become a bit boring and needs expansion, after 20+ hours of game-play its just the same thing over and over, area ""x size"" always square and go around perimeter until i then work my way into the middle, rinse repeat, the biomes are cool and quite different and i can see this being expanded on quite easily but we need triangle maps or long maps... anything... a square every time is just to simple to follow.

The amount of upgrades and weapon types is quite rich, they feel quite different from each other and would allow for a lot more variants from game to game.

Each class also offers a unique approach to each dive with their own specific weapons and stats. Allowing a variety of builds for all and bolstering the replay-value esque' game design we all come to love with roguelikes.
The enemy variety is admittedly a bit same-ey but it doesn't really matter all that much, their numbers and position poses much more of a threat. Leading to a fun game of cat and mouse when it comes to manipulating their pathing, especially with regards to the destructible terrain.

I'll list everything here i like or don't like as feedback.

Pros:
+ Addicting, even if it's way too grindy, it makes you come back.
+ 'Early Access', so (hopefully) a lot more content coming, looking forward to it.
+ The way you have to mine resources to buy upgrades in the menu is a fun mechanic.
+ Account/dwarf level is a neat progression system. (i wish dwarf level would increase their stats)
+ Vibe/theme of the game they are going for is cool and on point.
+ Weapons feel unique and they got nice effects.
+ Sound effects and music is good.
+ Many viable builds, lots of fun gun and overclock combinations.
+ Unique voicelines for most interactions. (ie. 1 unique line at least for almost every gunpick)

Mid:
+- Game's first 5-8 hours are fine, but the repetitiveness and grindiness becomes way too apparent.
+- Unlocking more artifacts dilutes the choice pool and you can't reroll them (a reroll implementation for maybe 10 Nitre?), you are forced to pick useless artifacts, and some can brick your run.
+- Menu upgrades don't have a refund button, so if you misclick, well the resources you spent for it are gone.
+- Games end too fast (~20 mins), by the time you feel powerful, you are killing the boss and the dive ends, there's no power fantasy and it is a ""survivors bullet hell"" game, an infinite mode or longer dives are needed. (10 stages in a dive perhaps?)
+- There are voicelines for a lot of interactions, but they are mostly 1 liners, these voicelines are funny for the first, maybe 1 hour, then it becomes very repetitive. (can we get a only dwarf voice toggle on-off)
+- The price... It's cheap but it could've been cheaper since Vampire Survivors just offers way more (and offered more at launch) than this game and is 5 Euros cheaper.

Cons:
- Biggest negative for me is that there's not enough sandbox feel to it until you literally grind out every weapon to lvl 12 to then be able to use their overclock capabilities, and even then you are REQUIRED to do hazard objectives to unlock more hazard levels/difficulties, no relief, you are chasing objectives all the time.
- Side objectives which reward you with 30 gold in each dive every stage also add to this, and there's only 3 of them. The 'Collect 12 Boolo Cap' one is unrewarding and too time consuming.
- Biome/hazard objectives that require you to level a specific gun to X levels. There's no way of checking which gun what class uses, so you either trial and error in-game or have to look it up online it.
- The way of unlocking overclock for weapons is clearly just time padding, don't like it.
- Enemies are way too spongy, movement feels very sluggish, luck doesn't seem to have enough effect, levelling speed falls off pretty quick.
- The 30s timer after killing the elite/boss either needs to get increased or just scrapped entirely, let the player scale as long as they want and can in the final stage of the dive at least, more risk/reward and longer games.
- Levels are too short and there's not enough time to do things. (it might be intentional, although i am not a fan of it)
- Movement speed and Mining speed upgrades in the menu start at +2 each upgrade, but after 5 upgrades into them they become +1 and the upgrades become more expensive. (why not just keep the +2s?)
- 3 biomes/maps only, 1 boss, few elites and only a handful of enemy types.
- Each biome has 5 difficulties (called 'Hazard levels') which you have to unlock, but these difficulties only add a health, damage and quanitity multiplier to enemies, and reuses enemy types rather than adding new ones, not a fun design, i'd prefer if there were new and reused enemies at the same time.

Some weapons like the grenades are pretty bad and could be something we could customize and have on coodown for when they could really be useful.

Multiplayer and bigger maps seems like something that should be in this game, At least 2 players maps, characters look like they complement each other, yet our only option is solo.

Customization would be nice, it's surely coming, but even some basic clothes would add a lil something.

I'd reduce the max lvl of weapons to 15, getting many levels is pretty long and the weapon bonuses are fun, yet the basic bonuses provide more utility faster.
While on the weapons, instead of replacing other elements, why can't they combo instead. If i build a Kinetic class, there's very little reason that i'd wanna use other elements, which sucks because having many elements is fun.

Classes are good, i like their passives, adding or switching some bonuses upon class masteries could give a lil something more.

The best part of the Survivor like genre is starting weak and ending up obliterating everything on screen. this game doesn't give you that. it only gives it you when the exploding enemies kill everything for you. you don't get to be a badass all you get to do is struggle to fight the enemies and the swarms kill themselves when they blow themselves up.

Weapon balancing & Spectacle: by balanced i mean the weapons that are just bad choices need to be WAY better and all the weapons i think need more impact. Vampire survivors is fun because you can end the game with 12 spinning lasers of death and 5 other weapons doing equally rediculous things. the subata pistol ends the game with 2 bullets instead of one firing out your arse. you see the difference? which would you rather see. i do understand this game has limits because its not pixel art and has DRG universe designs. but this isn't a survivors-like game.

This game is great, i do like it but guys i don't want to spend several hours+ grinding the meta progression so i can actually have a fun experience. honestly this game doesn't need any major changes but that makes the small things so annoying. 

Boss fight: So the boss you fight right at the end is completely different from everything until that point as it can jump to you no matter how fast you are or where you are which has killed me nearly every single run i do. this ruins any fun i have as if i want to play stationary with he engineer's turrets suddenly i'm 2 shot by that guy and can't stop to put down turrets. the enemies don't stop spawns all around you either. i already have destructible terrain blocking half the map and the enemies fill the rest of the gaps so where the hell are you meant to go? to the main menu i guess because thats where i went until my 8th time dying where i went to my desktop because it was no longer any fun to die to the boss at the end, the boss can only kill you with this one attack btw even though in the main game he has a fire ball and everything which i assume were not included for a good reason. 

Enemies: so when i play the original game a can can kill a regular mob in a couple of bullets. in this game its more like in 5 or 6 bullets. for the bigger enemies its even worse everything is a bullet sponge but unless you have maxed out meta progression which i don't i can almost never fight them to a standstill. i spent 5 hours and only got about 7 meta upgrades because i never have time to mine for materials.

In the end i'm still going to play it because its good but dying feels bad in this game and the meta progression is too slow for my liking i'll edit/remove this review if i change my mind after playing longer. i can't see me liking this unless the boss can't just jump on me and kill me instantly though. games like this are supposed to make you feel like a badass not a weakling who can hold off an army but die in 2 hits when the boss comes.

UPDATE 1: 10hours in now and i can say some of the issues i have are less pronounced mostly i figured out you HAVE to mine a big arena for the boss so you can move and stuff. however i will make it clear that the second and third biomes are genuinely AWFUL i don't even go on them anymore because the combat is built so that you have to run away but the stage is filled with obstructions and ranged enemies that spawn in the dozens, i have about 20% of the upgrades i HAVE to run away constantly and die immediately if i can't funnel a swarm. This genre started because of a casual game you didn't need to sweat the crap out of and i can honestly say hazard 2 is god damn difficult and it took me 10 hours of grinding to get 20% of the upgrades if the difficulty doesn't change the rate of progression needs to. i like this game but if i want to feel powerful i need to grind for dozens of hours which is exactly the opposite of how these games are supposed to make you feel. 

The last thing i will say is the weapons are by no means balanced and having to pick them and get them to level 12 is a stupid mechanic that i fail to do most of the time because my weapons are so weak i can't do anything unless i choose to upgrade the ones i already have overclocks for which means i can get 1 weapon to 12 never 2 that's IF i manage to win a run when i need to use 12 upgrade points on a sometimes completely useless weapon. some weapons are good from lvl 1 and some are useless even at 12. the Gunners minigun for example having it shoot only in the area in front of the player in a game thats designed for you to always be running away is really REALLY annoying and makes it by far the worst character starting out. i think this is the enemies fault and not the weapon because you can't even use forward firing weapons to carve a path through enemies because they are so tanky.",1708283261,1708478582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Meta progression is slow and barely felt in gameplay, the difference between starting a run and finishing a run isn't that large, you don't go from a nobody to a bullet-spewing god, you go from dwarf with gun overwhelmed by bugs to dwarf with four guns overwhelmed by bugs. Upgrades you get are random, meaning you can go the entire game without seeing a rare or better upgrade for the weapon you've designated as your main weapon for the run, and better rarity upgrades are extremely meaningful, as one lucky legendary means not taking five common upgrades (aka, five levelups that constitute a very substantial amount of levels you get in total). Weapons vary wildly, with a notable amount of them requiring careful movement and positioning when combined with the extremely tanky mobs, the mining system, random placement of turrets around you when you stand still, kiting enemies just right, triggering exploding mobs to clear area and other bugs - ideas that while appealing are not implemented cohesively. You need to mine facing rocks, but (some of) your guns also shoot toward where you're looking. You need to always keep moving since you cannot hold down an area reliably even when doing the greediest micro-optimizations that hundreds of hours in the series and multiple 100%-d games have taught you, but a lot of the map slows you down ever more thanks to the mining mechanic. You need to constantly stay ahead of the bugs with upgrades, but the map has a linear, constant progression ending with the area boss, where the only time you would theoretically be able to extend the time on a map is by delaying, yet killing the boss often cannot be avoided reliably due to the way guns target, and an extremely punishing drop-pod mechanic where you might have around 5 seconds to finish up something in the area you were when the boss died before being forced to rush to exit the map, being conscious of possible terrain RNG, movement enhancing upgrade luck you've had and the possibility of bug swarms between you and said drop-pod, or you auto-lose the mission. It feels bad when bugs rush you and there is no way to efficiently clear them to farm levels as fast as possible, mining feels bad since you often are dealing unoptimal DPS depending on your loadout, it feels bad when given all these issues of being forced to move, being unable to screenclear almost whatsoever even with perfect build choice and adequate RNG and no magnets spawning make you leave all the experience you've theoretically obtained on the ground since the drop-pod is waiting, and it feels bad when you're entirely at the mercy of RNG regarding upgrades, with rerolling of upgrades being the same currency you use to upgrade yourself between rounds of a dive and none of the tools of shaping upgrades present, such as not picking the ""entry"" upgrade to a tree (at best - don't pick up a structure or an elemental weapon when you're doing kinetic projectiles so you don't dillute your non-weapon pool) your build isn't interested in or the myriad of potions in Halls of Torment. The best weapons often do not rely anything but their targeting AI and line of sight to be good so the best pick is obvious almost every time, overclocking the guns - with the trailer promising ""dramatically changing the weapon's behaviour and giving you an edge in combat"" and the reality being often ""give the weapon another damage type, meaning it synergizes less with your kit now and floods your passive pool with more things that don't level up your gun nor benefit your entire arsenal"" - is terrible, and it's a shame it's advertised as the most impactful change to your gameplay given you even need to use the weapon semi-successfully without those overclocks first to even be able to overclock them in further runs. Most upgrades are numerical changes to the formula of ""X shots of Y damage per Z time, after a given amount of shots wait N time"", which are fine filler, but that's all there is to upgrades - pray the one that's purple or yellow when you get a level is damage or reload speed, not crit damage when you've yet to see a crit chance or fire rate on a shotgun with two shells in it. Even when fully utilizing every possible avenue of making yourself better the game gives you, the end result is ""you're not completely overwhelmed by the bugs just yet"", there's never the screen-clearing untouchable win-state of god run ends of other games, just ""you picked up just about enough damage to not be overwhelmed by trash while fighting the boss, good job, 5 runs like that and you can have your 2% mining speed upgrade!"". The game is careful to never let you get too strong, one of the main draws of having a god run in these types of games.
Not much here for fans of the survivors genre, rather another dwarf game for the DRG enjoyers - the can of paint, grindy nature of progression and the feeling of a hostile (randomly generated) world you're never entirely conquering being reminiscent. There are much better survivor titles in the 10 bucks range, although it definitely looks nice, and has potential if the training wheels were taken off and we could actually have meaningful win-states, better functioning upgrade and weapon-usage systems with a larger impact and less feelbad moments during gameplay. I don't regret my time, there's definitely potential here, but currently it's not really delivering what I look for in these games.",1708477969,1708477969,False,11,1,0.526381611824035645,0,True,False,True

This game does a great job of putting you on the edge of your seat, and forces you to make the best out of a bad situation. The game looks and feels great. From getting xp, to causing a massive chain reaction explosion, to just mining as the driller has a really satisfying feel to it. The classes feel different so that it actually changes the play style. Missions aren't too long and in the beginning there are frequent unlocks.

I have 4 main issues with this game.
The first and second issues basically go hand in hand, and that is the case of the difficulty and the meta progression. Unlocking a new hazard level basically always feels like the level is impossible to clear until you progress to a certain meta level. This is frustrating because it feels like player agency is taken away and you are simply forced to keep trying until you eventually reach a threshold where it's even possible to win. 

The third issue I have is that the progress bar for each individual mission feels like it punishes you for doing well. In order to succeed in this game, you must mine for resources while fighting hordes of bugs, pretty classic DRG gameplay. However, the progress bar which spawns the boss of the stage goes faster the more bugs you kill, which when it's sending swarm after swarm, causes it to spawn the boss too quickly in my opinion. You might not think that's a big problem, but if the boss is left alive for too long, the alien horde increases in power very quickly, forcing you to kill the boss and leave as fast as possible. In later stages on higher hazard levels, this happens too quickly for you to mine for the resources you need.

The fourth issue is with the guns. Some of them are just so much better than the others that it basically pigeonholes you into picking the same or at least similar load out every time. Another problem arises because of this, which is that the guns you can get are picked randomly from a pool of choices. You can reroll this, but it costs resources. Similarly, the overclocks seem imbalanced in the same way as the guns, but these you cannot reroll, so if you don't get what you want, too bad. 

It might be a surprise that I still gave this game a positive review, but it's still very fun regardless of these issues. I also trust the producers and have faith in them that they will make favorable changes to this game. That along with the low price point gets them a positive from me, and I am mostly hopeful that they read similar reviews to see what people like/don't like.",1708475421,1708475421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'd say to approach it differently than a regular VS clone though. It's less of a power fantasy and almost feels more like an extraction game.

Yes, these things matter.  Telling us they don't matter doesn't work.  We decide, not you.

Since you want to throw away all of the good graces you accumulated by being awesome in the past, I will be less reserved about my opinion of your product: it's worse than its competitors, it launched without keybinds, 
and somehow a game controlled almost exclusively by one stick and no buttons has framerate-dependent control issues in the menus.  The game design in general lacks purpose, the player rarely ever feels powerful, and agency is always overwhelmed by the oppressive nature of being in constant retreat from the perpetual swarm.

They should have gone with a much more active, involved style of play, but somehow managed to make a single-stick, no-button game that has even LESS player agency and decision-making than its predecessors.  This occurs due to the rarity of the one active pickup in the game (magnet), which you can generally rely upon in other games, several times a map, even.  In this game you find fewer than one per map.

Buy any other autoshooter if you want the gameplay.

Stop pandering to weak people.  Let's get things back on track.  I want the people who make games I am excited about back.

It's a good price, but I would still wait for more to come out the game could use some beefing.

Couple things to note:

- not actually dev'd by Ghost Ship games or the people who made DRG (Made by Funday Games)
- this is the team that made ""Subway Surfer"" on iOS and ""Don't DIE in the West"" on Steam

Positives:

- Damn fun for the first few hours, I was immediately hooked to the gameplay loop of mine/shoot/loot/level
- Aesthetic is very nice and obviously the same as Ghost Ship Games: DRG
- Visually pleasing, not too busy, and generally fun to try and catch everything on the screen
- The upgrades are straight forward, easy to understand/select, and fun
- The weapons are straight forward, easy to use, and fun
- The enemies are obviously similar to DRG, but not exactly the same making for a new learning curve though only slightly different
- Aspects of the level designs and aesthetics are fun and engaging
- The passive upgrades you upgrade before any dives are similar to the in-game upgrades. Easy to understand, not unachievable but not incredibly easy to level, and somewhat effective (I feel like upgrading in the menu does actually make a tangible impact on my in-game play)

Negatives:

- Bosses are not a challenge in any way in terms of mechanics - I only ever die to my health being too low before the fights began or to not having enough DPS to finish the fights quickly (Up to Haz 2)
- Upgrades feel good at a certain point, but then as you ramp and build into your run/build, the run ends because you've beat the mission - (Even your character says ""That's great for my build"" or something like that, but your build isn't even a build until the very end of the final mission)
- Mining feels weird and is sometimes inconsistent/random - there is no real value in mining unless convenient
- Shooting is just the most odd mechanic in this game, several guns shoot where you are facing only and often times are shooting rocks or the supply pod instead of enemies (directional shooting pls)
- Electric is the clear defined meta of this game as most other options struggle with healthy crowd control (make fire more viable)
- The supply drop is fun but it would be nice to see more upgrade options, I would even prefer there not to be good things every time, more of a mixed bag of Low and High tier items as the upgrades per level are
- More upgrade varieties would be great


There is not much that I feel needs to change, the game is pretty spot on but just missing a few core pieces that could make it go from a C+ to B game to an A-A+ game. A few updates, maybe beef up the level or game mode options, honestly increase the spawns of the mobs too. All very easy fixes and they are working with a great publisher who likes to listen to its playerbase.

I will certainly play/enjoy this game beyond the writing of this interview; I plan to beat the game in its entirety and I am already through Hazard 1 at 6 hours and rolling in Haz 2 during hour 6.

Okay the game seems good at first but then the difficulty spikes way up when I played it on Hazard Two. Whatever I try to build for just doesnt seem to work as the Bugs/Glyphids just become overpopulated on the map for me to do anything. There are walls to dig through, side objectives to complete, and a bunch of other gimmicks that I have to grind through, all while trying to survive and beat the stage. It really sucks that I have to literally die just to get upgrades like overclocks for my weapons. Which are the upgrades that give the weapon a boost, but they are locked until you level up the weapon to twelve and either die or beat the stage. Its like there are so many things to do in this game that it has an identity crisis on what its supposed to be. Remember Vampire survivors where you literally just move around or stand still while the bullets kill the enemies. Well DRG: Survive is exactly like that except that there way too many things to do at the same time. It also forces you to stand still in situations where you have to be constantly moving. Like the Gunners minigun only facing one direction. You have to stand still and aim the cone of fire at the bugs for it to be effective.

For example beer, why are there no fun beers with buffs, like in Deep Rock Galactic.
In my opinion the stages are waaaay too short, very often I can't even uncover half the map before getting the ""return to drop pod"" countdown. And with the little amount of time you get swarms are very annoying, because they make it hard to move and uncover more of the map.
This time constraint also leads to it being virtually impossible to max out more than 2 weapons per run, which just makes having 4 weapon slots completely useless. Give us more time, please! (any maybe bigger Maps as well?)
You also leave a lot of exp uncollected each stage, often multiple levels, some kinda magnet on the drop pod could fix that. Maybe make it salvage and upgradable percentage of the exp lying around.
On the part of weaponry there i'm kinda missing melee options/the pickaxe being usable against bugs.

And very important to me personally: BOSCO, why does he not have upgrades?

What i currently like is the multitude of weaponry and their unlockable overclocks and the fun aspect of mining and fighting. Also the different kinds of status effects feel well done.

Just like in Deep Rock Galactic, DRG: Survivor puts the player in the work boots of a dwarf miner on a distant alien planet. Players must complete a series of objectives (ranging from collecting X amount of minerals and securing supply drops to killing bosses) so they can descend into the next layer of the level - all while surviving a relentless alien onslaught. Each mission has 5 layers, each getting progressively harder than the last, and on higher hazard levels, the missions prove to be quite difficult.

This is a very addictive game and even though the concept is straightforward, the execution is amazing - which makes for a highly entertaining experience. The voice acting and sound design is on point, and the isometric-style camera angle gives this game a nostalgic kind of aesthetic (it reminds me of the old StarCraft, Outlive, and Diablo games) while still delivering stunning environments and creatures to the player.

If this is what the game is like in early access, I can only imagine what might come next - and I'm excited for it!

Few things are as satisfying as mowing down wave after wave of bug-like aliens, but if there was one thing that would make that even more fun - it would be if we could do that with friends! I imagine that scaling the difficulty and balancing everything for that would be a challenge, but one that would undoubtedly position DRG: Survivor as one of the best games of the year.

""Removed the Dwarf voice line ""Die like your mother did"" because we think it's out of place and don't want to remind some players of tragic events in their life when they want to relax with a video game. We might add a voice line filter in options down the line if enough people want it.""

They are rightfully getting roasted for this absurd censorship of an iconic DRG voice line. The dwarf isn't even referring to the player's mother, but to the bug's mother. What, are we unable to insult the bug hoards now? What about people with arachnophobia who are seriously stressed out and frightened by spiders, even digital ones? Because this game has giant yellow spiders that explode. And i made this post that was swiftly removed: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3164976224 The mods are doing overtime with damage control. And they are removing other topics criticizing this move.

They also locked this thread giving legit criticism: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2321470/discussions/0/6292161380826562223/
""The fact that you believe nobody even notices what they say just highlights how little this should matter to you anyone else it doesnt effect."" That's not a reason to lock valid criticism.

Not just the censorship, but the game is also horribly unbalanced. it takes a long time of grinding the first difficulty of the first level before you can really start to beat the other difficulties. This is exacerbated by the fact that you must first level a weapon to 12 before you can even start using the powerful and absolutely necessary overclocks on that weapon in future runs. There's a pinned tips page that helps you play which I already did all of them, and the game is still very difficult, especially on higher difficulties where enemies will often outscale your damage if you haven't been lucky with the rng powerups. And I'm not the only one complaining here either.

So with both of these things in mind I decided I needed to leave a negative review now so other people know what's going on, and to wait until the devs fix these issues, if they fix them.

I am pleased to say that this is absolutely not the case. Funday Games nailed it. It feels like a DRG game.

It's not PERFECT yet, I would definitely like to see some gameplay tweaks (the timer appearing after you kill the boss and the boss itself appearing after you kill enough enemies discourages you from killing enemies, which sucks) and more variety in upgrades (particularly more ""synergies"" and ""builds"" being possible), but they have managed the hardest part. I'm sure all these tweaks will come in time.

the game itself is decent and a nice distraction for the price but overall the progression in-runs is fairly minimal, most if not all of the upgrades are stat increases and even the OCs which are usually known for having some horizontal progression also mostly end up being larger stat tweaks (there are some exceptions like giving turrets wheels but those are few and far between from my experience) paired with the scaling of the mission and incentive to dump all your upgrades into a single weapon and ignore the rest due to how OCs are unlocked/added and this makes runs often feel similar 

still not bad if you wanna grab it on sale or you're a huge DRG fan who wants a bit more the series in your library, but I'd say wait till the game has a bit more fleshed out on it, it is in early access after all so these points may not be as relevant with time",1708466429,1708466429,False,8,0,0.566479682922363281,0,True,False,True

I think the difficulty is way too much right now. I can barely pass Haz 1 sometimes. After 30 secs upon dropping there will be so many enemies you have no choice but to just run. I also think that overclocks should be available at a lower level, I've only gotten to use overclocks twice and I could only use them for the last stage because it takes so long to unlock. If you try to keep your other weapons leveled, you will NEVER get an overclock. So its either have one really good weapon and 3 crappy, or have 4 weapons roughly equal in strength.

the over clocks are annoying to obtain to a new weapon because you essentially have to throw your run just to get your gun to level 12.
the over clocks themselves are extremely lazy, and mostly give you a stat boost and for most weapons you are gonna get the same over clocks, and personally because I love deep rock yeah yeah rock and stone it really disappointed me that this game is not great, even the most iconic over clock in deep rock is not here [spoiler] Fat boy [/spoiler].
the 30 seconds timer to get to the drop pod every time i finish a stage is so infuriating, I lost so many runs dying on the way to the drop pod or missing it because i don't have enough time to collect the xp and i try to collect as much as i can because xp is so barren in the late game because you are always swarmed with endless waves of tanky small mobs that cant die and deal somewhat large amounts if damage to you depends on the class, and oh speaking of classes:
the gunner is the best class, no question, has basically the best weapons because he get the weapons from other classes that are supposed to be the ""super weapon"" for each one except the driller, and he has high defense and health, the driller himself has no good weapons up until you unlock some high level weapons but at that point you'd rather play as any other class, the engineer has no choice in the weapons because he either has good weapons or absolute dogshit weapons and surprisingly his secondaries are really boring and bad, and the scout is just... boring, they tried to make every other class slightly unique but when i came to scout they gave him run of the mill weapons with lukewarm overclocks and class upgrades.

Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is an absolute blast, delivering a near-flawless translation of the core Deep Rock Galactic experience into the endlessly replayable roguelite format. Funday Games has outdone themselves, creating a spin-off that stands confidently on its own while honoring the spirit of the original.

At its heart, Survivor exemplifies the addictive roguelite formula. Each run offers a fresh challenge, with procedurally generated levels ensuring no two experiences are alike. You're always on the move, blasting hordes of Glyphids, mining valuable minerals, and scrambling to stay ahead of the encroaching swarms. The combat is incredibly smooth and responsive, echoing the high-octane action of its predecessor. Each of the four classes (Driller, Engineer, Gunner, and Scout) provides a unique playstyle and powerful abilities. Seeing how far you can push yourself under relentless pressure will have you saying ""just one more round!"" long into the night.

From unique weapons and class-specific upgrades to potent artifacts and game-changing perks, Survivor is brimming with creative choices and a sense of tactical depth. There's a joy in experimenting with loadouts, discovering the insane synergies between upgrades, and adapting strategies with each new item you find. Survivor doesn't hold back with content either; there are tons of unlockables to keep you coming back for more, ensuring a rewarding progression system that motivates you to try out different playstyles.

Presentation is essentially flawless....despite the huge hordes of bugs, complete with their reflections on crystals, and some fantastic particle effects, the game keeps up pace and runs smoothly, with minimal loading times. The instant access to pause the game via the Right Mouse Button, with an overview of your current build, keeps you in the game as often and as quickly as you like. 

If you're a fan of Deep Rock Galactic or simply love a well-crafted roguelite, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a must-play.  With its smooth combat, creative upgrades, and deep progression, it's a captivating spin-off that delivers everything fans could hope for in this fresh format.

There are core aspects of the game that need addressed, and SHOULD have been addressed before this game was put on sale.  It doesn't feel like a game that was even playtested, or if it was, it was play tested by an IGN reviewer.

Balance doesn't exist.  This wouldn't matter if there weren't missions/quests in the game that direct you to play a certain way.  Most builds are not viable.  Many weapons shouldn't even be touched.  There are upgrades in the game that even the legendary version is worse than the common option of a different upgrade.

Also, there's no co-op or multiplayer.  That's kind of the very core of DRG, this game should have had that running before even releasing it to the public.

I was talking with a friend and sadly the best way to explain this game without you having to read the rest of the review is, [i]Son, we have Deep Rock Galactic at home and this game is shown[/i]. 

Sure I get it, this game is in Early Access I KNOW, sure I know it's a Vampire Survivors like, but I love Vampire Survivors.
If you have stuck around let me just get to the meat as to why not recommend. Again this pains me so much but basically the 3 pillars of why Deep Rock is fun is that it's [b]fun with friends[/b], obviously it's a [b]mining game so that's really fun and interesting[/b] and there is [b]vast customisation with very different characters[/b]. 
At least most of these pillars or really, all 3 don't continue in this game. Firstly massive red flag, this game is single player, sure I get it fun and probably cheaper to make but really most probably the chaos with your friends is why most people play Deep Rock. Second if you don't have friends and you really are a dwarf then mining is your thing so that's why you play Deep Rock...yeah none of that here. No controls, just WASD so move and the dwarf does everything automatically, yes like Vampire Survivors but come on maybe let me click my mouse for that at least? Ok let's not do that ignore what I said but still let me enjoy my mining, let me see gold and go ouuu yes! Not every time I see gold or Nitra or anything else I'm like god no, I'm gonna get slowed down and this endless never ending swarm will kill me! Please I don't want to see anymore minerals. 
Lastly the customisation, so this was the ehh sorta, it's here but not really. You can technically customise your build and get the gunner, scout weapons and grenades so what...is the point of the other classes really? Not much, minor things like the scout can move faster...yey, no grapple btw cause why have something that cools down for lets say 30 seconds and uses something other than WASD make the game more fun and original? No Gunner shield cause again same reason as stated before. It's just painful. So many obvious things where missed...and I can't think of a reason why. It really feels like a chore than just having fun with Deep Rock again and it makes me very sad. It's just a worse Vampire Survivors like with a Deep Rock skin and that's it.

8 dollars... big bang in fun for the buck.
Graphics - runs smooth with that DRG feel
Bugs? None that I have noticed, except the ones on fire.
Builds upon the survivor genre with it's own unique mechanics

Cons:
Progress slows a bit much later into the game. Gets a little grindy to get upgrades maxed post 1/2 way.
The rounds feel a bit short, I feel the progress bar shouldn't be tied to kills that harshly.

Crazy to me how some don't recommend for it's current flaws. For 8 bucks, and a great developer team as proven by the original DRG success and iteration, I am a firm believer they will bring about a great game after a little polish!

1. [u]Balancing and progression[/u]
The balancing in this game after the first few hours get to feel slow and repetitive, as you have to meticulously grind in order to get universal upgrades for stats and dwarfs. Progression does not feel rewarding, it takes to long for how much you get and gets worse with time, with the game getting boring/frustrating quickly.


2.[u] Weapon functionality and Gameplay [/u]

This is probably what I dislike most about this game. The way weapons function makes 0 sense to me. No weapons in this game require you to aim, and the way the weapons themselves shoot does not make sense for how gameplay works with fighting the bugs. The game quickly devolves into trying to work around how your weapons do not function effectively with how you want them to, the biggest offender being the flamethrower which spins slowly in a circle (often times not hitting anything) instead of targeting the bugs. [b]You are at the mercy of how your weapon aims.[/b] Along with mainly boring % upgrades, there isn't much in the way of creativity or skill in fighting the bugs. Just running, mining and choosing the upgrade with the biggest %.


[u]Conclusion:[/u] The game has too much unrewarding grind. The gameplay feels repetitive and frustrating when it comes to how swarms function in respective to how weapons work. Gameplay as a whole feels un-engaging with the feeling of skill not being present at all, just running and mining to escape while fighting against how weapons work, instead of the bugs.",1708460252,1708461299,False,1,0,0.50141298770904541,0,True,False,True

It's hard to see the effects of a 2% increase to firing speed when your gun is already a pea-shooter with no damage. 
It's hard to fight a boss when the game feels it's appropriate to fill the level with hundreds of enemies to go with him, as well as making them harder to kill as time goes on, which makes the boss harder to kill in return.
It seems pointless to pick an overclock ability for your gun when the options are ""Electric"" and ""Acid"" when the game doesn't even bother telling you what either of those effects does.
The meta-progression is a slog with most of the effects you can boost just feeling like filler.
The classes and what makes them special feels inconsistent and their starter weapons feel very underwhelming.
The reload system absolutely kill this game for me. Not only can you never really choose what to shoot at (outside of simply standing closest to the thing you want to kill), but now there will be times when all your guns are reloading, and you're just standing in a crowded hallway like a dumbass waiting for a timer to tick down to start dealing damage again.

When your main competition in this genre is a game like Vampire Survivor, who has already mastered this formula, it seems strange to try to re-invent the wheel in such a way where I wish I was playing a different game.
This game is DRG in name alone, and has little to do with the game whose name it's piggy-backing on. The characters just throw out recycled lines from DRG, the weapons all feel underpowered and situational, and the setting could be any other generic sci-fi scenario and it wouldn't change the game one bit.
The game is missing what makes DRG special. Teamplay, frantic gun-play, creative builds and charming environments, enemy variety and setting are all missing from this game.

It's almost there however and I strongly believe this thumbs down will turn on its head by the time they've had a few patches out. As it is now the game feels a bit over-balanced, almost none of the weapons feel fun to use and the progression paths are uninteresting on most of them, along with extremely tedious stat upgrades after missions where you get things like ""2% mining speed"" after a 30min run, feels a bit too slow. This along with every end-boss being the same and the missions being generally quite uninteresting. Lots of whining but there are general glimpses of greatness here as well. The mining addition is a fresh breath of air for the genre and I wish they would double down on this even harder, I think there are a thousand more ways they could explore to make it more central to the game play loop. For now its not really worth it if you are a big fan of the genre as there are too many competitors that just do the same thing but better, but hopefully in a years time this will stand shoulder to shoulder with the greats, fingers crossed.",1708459401,1708459401,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. There is no sense of mystery. All possible unlocks are visible, albeit it's not clear what the unlock conditions are (you can access them, but it's a pain).
2. It's not DRG in terms of look, feel and gameplay. Sure, it's a different genre, but the art style is too different, the guns are just nominally similar, so are dwarves. The feeling of large unknown, and you being opressed is not there either, the game is well lit and levels are absolutely tiny.

As a survivors-like, it fails on many points as well. One key for me was how jarring the pacing feels, it's okay, but it's just too rushed, you have no time to appreciate your upgrades at all.

Side objectives are really half-baked, to the point where I would prefer that they did not exist. You can't always achieve them, and then you just feel bad for wasted effort knowing there's little you could have done differently.

Main objectives are mixed for me, the level-to-level objective with a miniboss is okay, but it's too simplistic, as you can kill it by dropping the pod on it every time. It just feels like going through the motions, that's the by far easiest and best way to do it, and it sucks all the fun and variety out.

The core objective at the end of the run is better in a sense, but also worse. You can take something like 50% hp off the boss with the pod, but I had runs where I could simply not get at the boss. That is - my guns would mow down everything else, but refuse to target the boss.

Finally, the whole extraction thing feels horrible. In DRG it feels like a victory run, like you're the hero escaping after a successful mission and the game does everything it can to help you get there generally. In here, you have 30s, and it's just enough in most cases, sometimes it forces you to run through the mobs and get hit just to make it in time. It's a punishment quite frankly.

Pickled nitra is a death sentence so I have never taken it since there's no way to get rid of nitra on the last stage, you need to get super lucky with movement speed to have a shot generally speaking. I've played a lot of DRG and a lot of these Survivor type games and that 30 second timer doesn't really fit either of them. I can count on one hand the amount of times I've been left behind by the pod without being downed on DRG and all of them were because of my friends trolling me, and I can't think of any other Survivor type game with a death timer rather than a victory timer and I'm not 100% sure what that mechanic being so harsh adds to the game. Either remove or allow us to circumvent impassable terrain, improve the pod's location choosing or extend the timer and it'll be fine.

- Progression and each run feel samey
- The grind is tedious and a bit brutal
- Lots of % increases instead of abilities or extra weapons (you max out at 4)
- Mutations (Overclocks) are great but are spread thin
- Not a lot of options for unique and crazy builds
- The bugs are bullet sponges
- You are essentially always running away while trying to mine resources 
- Levels are short in duration
- Same monster types for every zone

If you were to ask me what my favorite class is, I can't answer that. Because they are all phenomenal in different ways. 4 main classes (12 total subclasses) are all amazing and those biome goals want you to use specific classes / loadouts. 

It's also a reverse difficulty game. It's easy to fall behind the curve and struggle to survive in latter phases, but I found the gameplay loop to be a nice session -- typically up to 30 minutes if you get all the way through, and you'll die lots especially trying to push those boundaries by not killing the boss right away.

At first I thought the scout was a crappy class, but after levelling up other classes, going back to the scout was pretty impressive. Seems like every weapon no matter how bad it seems becomes very powerful by level 18. 

For example, in hazard 4 hollow bough, you need to acquire 600 gold in a single run. That's a lot! It also wants you to level the subata rear firing machine gun to level 25. I hated the subata as it makes for a difficult start. So the driller foreman starts with it, and also has a perk that lets you mine 50% faster once you get going. There is an artefact that gives you a chance of gaining gold when mining any rock. So that's the plan. Get that perk early (luck), and mine the crap out of everything. I haven't pulled it off yet, but did complete the dive and got subata to 25. Once it hit 18, it became impressively powerful, like a tailgun on a B17 bomber.

The harder the hazard level, the faster you level up, but also the faster the levels complete because progress is tied to kills. Once you get a weapon to level 18, you can really go toe to toe against most waves and get that sweet leveling machine rolling.

I'm really enjoying this game. I don't know if multiplayer is coming, but I imagine that would add a lot. I am also impressed how you just move with the left stick. No aim, no fire button. The only time you press a button is to select a perk. 

On the downside, I find the UI is laggy despite the game being paused, and more than once I accidentally chose the wrong perk.",1708448276,1708448276,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

In Deep Rock Galactic, you can explore the caves almost indefinetely, teamwork is dreamwork and has lots of objectives and little things that makes you love the game.
Here, you fight one horde, and when you have cleared 50% of it, a droppod lands, and when you clear the entire wave, another waves comes in. This is TOO fast, too rushed, it makes you leave minerals and exp behind, its very unsatisfying.
Weapons are too weak, and weak enemies are too strong. I can't count the ammount of times I've beein hit multiple times by a small enemy left out by the AoE of my weapons, and my single target weapons were too weak for them. 
Make elites less annoying and more interesting, not only a bullet sponge.
Make weapons more impactful.
Let us explore the cave all we want. (Yeah you can technically do it if you edge the boss, the monsters get stronger tho)
Give the game more content.
More weapons and overclocks.
Some say the game is too grindy. (I don't really think so, it should be fixed by making exploring the cave better)
I don't know if i'm too bad, I've played a lot of games like this one, but I'm almost 10h deep and I CAN'T consistently clear Haz 2, specially not with gunner or scout.

Besides the IP (which I am aware of, but not an ardent fan of), this game simply has good graphics. There is nothing within the confines of the Survivor-like sub-genre that DRG:S does as well as, let alone better than, any of the titles I listed.

At their core, Survivor-like titles can be summarized as taking the 100+ hours it takes to reach max level in an ARPG like Diablo or PoE and condensing them down to 15-20 minute bite-sized chunks of power fantasy wish fulfillment badassery. You go from a weakling to a god in a few minutes. It's intoxicating and, above all else, fun af.

DRG:S does not seem to understand that. There is, no matter what you do, no moment at which you feel more powerful than you did the moment before. Heck, it's SUPREMELY easy to become LESS powerful when you make a choice, because of the way the game scales itself and the fact that effectively NONE of the weapons synchronize or synergize with one another. There are, at its core, SO many poor design decisions (within the confines of this sub-genre) that are baffling to me.

Weapons, despite mostly being guns and variations thereof, cannot be aimed. You are wasting ammo and damage output when you pick many of them. They have idiotic limitations like ""only shoots ahead of you"" or ""throws randomly in a direction"" that you will, at least half the time, have a weapon equipped that is unsuitable for what you need.

The weapons cannot be manually reloaded. That means you will often find yourself in a situation where your weapons simply are not available to you when you need them most. (And good luck if they don't shoot where you NEED them to shoot.)

Besides that, the weapons do not synergize. There are no wild combinations or effects that make any decision more meaningful than another. It's just +Damage or +Crit Chance. No, Fire weapon + Acid weapon = special Napalm damage. Nothing works together. Some weapons are outright horrendous choices that actively harm your ability to kill enemies. It sucks. (And what do effects DO? What is the difference between acid and fire? Plasma and electricity? No clue. Game doesn't explaining itself.)

The enemies scale at such a degree that if you do not prioritize damage, you will get overwhelmed. Period. Once the boss spawns, enemy swarms scale in size, number, and HP every 30 seconds (or so it seems) to a degree that makes it essentially impossible to overcome the odds. Count on it. It WILL happen to you. It's just a matter of how much you can put up with it.

The mining mechanic is a neat idea, but woefully misused. By placing the player on a fixed map (instead of the endlessly scrolling ones that are common in S-likes), you can AND WILL run into scenarios where you corner yourself by no fault of your own. The game does not telegraph or inform you of the map's size or limitations before you discover it yourself and remove the fog of war. But that can only happen if you wander, which means you're not managing objectives, which means you're wasting opportunities to progress the meta-upgrades (which are lame and uninspired). It also means you need to abandon collecting XP gems because if you're mining, you're not killing bugs. You'll have maneuverability, but have too many bugs to kill. If you try and kill them, you're not mining, which means you're unable to maneuver when needed.

My suggestion(s):

1) Allow players to aim and reload their guns. This would be the most important and most effective way of changing the balance of the game. Period. It looks and feels like it should be a twin-stick shooter variant of the S-like formula. Embrace it. Lean into it. The other systems at play do NOT afford a fun experience if it's simply an auto-attack style game. Which ties into...

2) Make the auto-attack be a secondary fire mode for every weapon. Take cues from Death Must Die, a more traditional ARPG-like spin on the formula that lets players choose, and actively change, whether they auto-attack or manually attack. But make it a per-weapon choice. Maybe I want the acid spitter to be spinning around me as I secure a drop. But when I'm mining a path, I want to ensure it's spitting behind me. Let me make that choice. Maybe I want the microwave emitter thing to auto-shoot to my left because that's where the swarm is approaching from, but maybe I want it ahead of me because that's where I want the path to be cleared. Let ME choose that. Let ME aim my armaments. (Do you know how rarely I need the shotgun shooting RIGHT in front of me?? Rarely ever. Know what is in front of me a lot? Rock and stone. Because I'm mining. What good is having a shotgun that is idling as I look at a stone wall when there is a literal planet's worth of nasty space bugs crawling up my ass? Oh, I can turn around and feed them some lead, sure. But then I'm actively NOT doing what I WANT to be doing, which is mining myself a path to escape the buggers. It's diametrically opposed design decisions like that that just boggle the mind.)

3) Allow for one of two things: either allow weapons to be combined to create all new bug killing monstrosities in-run (the way VS combines powers) or keep giving us new weapon choices every few levels (the way Soulstone Survivors continues to allow you to swap your choices). The last thing I want to find out in the middle of an otherwise good run is that I just picked a bad weapon. So let me rectify that mistake by still giving me the chance to pick a new one later. Maybe drop weapon caches the way the artifacts drop. Or let me pay currency to grab a new weapon during a level up. Something. As it stands, it is far FAR too easy to cripple your run because so many of the weapons just outright suck to have equipped, but you don't know that until you use them, and then it's too late. You may as well die right away because your run is ruined. There's no overcoming choosing a bad weapon and no way to make that weapon different or more effective in a way that matters.

4) Make the map endless. Just have the materials spawn randomly as-is, but let us go wherever we feel we need to. The vines and tougher rocks and stuff, that's fine. Nice little speed bumps. But actively putting us on platforms that limit maneuverability is far FAR too limiting when the heat gets turned up. And it will.

5) GET RID OF THE TIMER. Why the F are we forced to suicide run at the end of every level to finish things? If I just survived the boss and completed my objectives, I WANT THE SPOILS OF MY EFFORTS. Period. I want to be rewarded with mountains of XP, not punished with a lower health bar going into the next stage because I had to brute force suicide run to get to the ramp, which then means I'm spending gold on health and not upgrades to actively make myself stronger. And that's only even possible IF I managed to sneak in enough mining of loot bugs and upgrade materials while managing all the other crap in a given stage.

5b) If you won't get rid of the timer, then ALWAYS have the boss drop a magnet. Always. Again, I WANT THE REWARDS FOR OVERCOMING THE ODDS YOU'VE STACKED AGAINST ME. I DO NOT WANT TO BE PUNISHED AND FEEL LIKE I'M MISSING OUT.

Until the team decides what they want DRG:S to truly be, either a simplistic ode to a better-designed game with the same IP or a truly great entry in an emerging genre, this game isn't worth your time or money. There are better, cheaper options available. My recommendation isn't just not to play it. It's to seek a better game in the genre like VS, Halls of Torment, or Death Must Die if you are interested in it. Those are the objectively best entries in the genre I have experience with. I know there are more. Interested? Go find them. They are likely better thought out than DRG:S is.

Yes they did. In a game where you shoot other living creatures with guns, cook and burn them alive, electrocute them and poison them. In a game where you commit genocide for profit. They removed a war cry. These developers are a joke.

Bland, slow, and ultimately not satisfying - which is the only thing you could go for in a survivors-like game. It doesn't bring anything new to the table that we haven't seen, and it does all the usual stuff worse than any alternative. Hitboxes are unpredictable and not properly communicated, upgrades are low-impact, music and SFX are muffled and distant (not even correctly spatial), hitting an enemy is like hitting a curtain, enemy variety is low, UI is clunky.

And no amount of rocks and stones is going to be enough to overcome this.

You might want to check out Swarm Grinder instead, which DRG:S has suspiciously [i]a lot[/i] in common with.

EDIT: Eighteen hours later, and it doesn't get any better. All runs feel the same. There's no synergies you can make. It's all about how much you've previously grinded for permanent upgrades. No matter which weapon upgrades you choose during a run, the way you move and approach enemies is exactly the same. It's a miracle indeed - they've managed to make a bad game when all the hard work had already been done for them: they had all the lore and flavor pre-built, and survivors-like is the easiest dаmned genre to nail. You just need to make it fun.

It's funny how none of the positive reviews have anything good to say about the game. It's all just memes and ASCII art of compressed gold (which isn't even in the game).

EDIT 2: There's also a bunch of bugs with softlocks. Also the last stage sometimes doesn't load (it just shows Loading... screen without really doing anything, which I suspect is a softlock as well).

Stages are often hard to pace because secondary objectives can be really spread out, and bugs slow your progress around the map big time. Besides balance tweaks that I'm not smart enough to suggest, here's the simple solution:

AFTER DEFEATING THE BOSS, LET US CALL IN THE DROP POD

AND ADD BONUS XP BASED ON STAGE CLEAR TIME

With these two changes, I think the game would be vastly improved.
Want to go for the secondary objective and risk the bugs getting so strong they could overwhelm you? Go for it.
Want to focus the boss so hard and get that sweet supply drop insta kill so you can clear the stage in record time, getting some bonus XP? Do it.

In the state of progression right now, all the wrong things feel rushed. Drop pod timer being the biggest issue. It doesn't feel good that killing the stage boss quickly is only BAD for you. That should not be the case in a game like this.

What I like: 
+ A variety of different characters and weapons, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.
+ A strong variety of weapons, class mods, and relics to work towards at launch.
+ Price ($9 at launch)

What I don't like:
- The enemies scale in difficulty too high early on. Even Tier 3 (out of 5 tiers of difficulty) is incredibly difficult without the right RNG drops.
- The levels feel too short. My suggestion is four longer levels instead of 5 short ones.

NO MULTIPLAYER.  Honestly I was so certain it would include this that I bought it out of hand, and copies for my friends, before seeing it was single player.

The selection of weapons is pulled from the og DRG which is nice but feels weak when it comes to descriptions and variety. At the harder levels it becomes agitating to balance secondary objectives and kiting enemies (which can be quite fast for some instances to the point its unfair) and the exploder bugs can become extremely annoying and will often ruin a run. When you get hit with multiple at a time, say goodbye to your health because you can be hit by SEVERAL at a time if they all explode at once (each doing up to 30 dmg). The ending boss also has a somewhat predictable attack (which does half health damage for most characters) but in some pregen maps it becomes IMPOSSIBLE to dodge and no matter how powerful you are its a game breaker. This game is hard to love but hard to hate and I hope EA will get better in the near future.

EDIT:
After playing for some more time Ill list some specific pros and cons that I'm talking about

PROS:
Credit and Material system for perma-upgrades presents a nice long term game play loop which is enjoyable at first

Lots of weapon variety

Classic lines from OG DRG are still enjoyable and they've added a few extra lines

Good potential for a casual gaming experience

CONS:
Harder levels become very tight when trying to balance secondary objectives and kiting enemies to gather the xp they drop. It becomes a decision of either focus on collecting the secondaries or actually leveling up to get powerful.

(currently) Single Boss type which has an unforgiving damage output and will often end a run in the clustered pre-gen maps

XP is primarily (other than mining) gained by killing enemies and retrieving the xp they drop which in the harder levels becomes very difficult when some enemies go faster and some slower which makes kiting nearly impossible in some levels

Magnets (which retrieve all xp in the map) are dropped once in a blue moon (in my experience) *this could be solved by supply drops acting as an automatic magnet when you clear them*

Weapons variety is good but some weapons are downright just not useful to pickup compared to others, assuming this will be fixed in future updates (minigun is awful at the beginning stages)

Mining is interesting and is often a good strat to escape and direct hordes but special veins feel a little too cumbersome to mine, especially when upgrades are more useful for damage vs minig speed. Hopefully in updates they decrease the total hits needed to mine them because it becomes impossible to get precious minerals at later stages when you're being swarmed constantly and enemies hit even harder",1708397794,1708441520,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,True

+ Like it's predecessor each biome has it's own mechanics and hazards.

You need to unlock upgrades by completing milestones over the course of multiple runs to be able to take on further stages, and thus by design will 'fail' your first couple dives before you have the equipment necessary to take on huge hordes and lots of elites. It only takes around half an hour to unlock adequate equipment to complete the first difficulty tier. Unlocking something or multiple somethings in a run is a win in and of itself. This is on par with other survivor games that I have played like Vampire Survivors or Boneraiser Minions.

Pros: 
- [b]Unique biome features[/b] you can take advantage of to quell the swarm of glyphids, such as exploding plants in Magma Core, and regrowing brush in Hollow Bough.
- [b]Altering navigatable paths[/b] and choke points by mining.
- [b]Risk versus reward[/b] for attaining materials for meta upgrades during a run. It feels great to get away with training a horde around to finally mine some Croppa. 
- [b]Large arsenal[/b] of weapons. 
- [b]Price[/b]. Game is cheap! 
- [b]Satisfying to make bugs go splat[/b], especially with the beefed up upgrades after you unlock a lot of things.

Cons: 
- [b]Limited upgrade variety[/b]. Different status effects are cool but a lot of the overclocks are just dps increases. Would be nice to see the unique overclocks from the original Deep Rock Galactic in the future.
- [b]Class identity[/b]. Currently only the Driller has a unique traversal tool in his first subclass, being able to mine faster with his drills. It would be great if other class had traversal tools. Maybe allow the Scout to grapple over chasms, Engineer to platform hazardous ground, and Gunner to set up ziplines for faster traversal. 
- [b]Run length[/b]. A won run only lasts 15 minutes or so, which often makes it so you only get to experience a full build for the last couple minutes. I would love to see an option to loop after completing a run to continue playing - with more dense hordes and way more elite enemies to continue the challenge.
- [b]Limited content[/b]. While the arsenal is huge, the environments and objectives you can use them in/against are not, at a total of 3 unique biomes and 6 objectives (including side objectives).

While definitely Early Access in it's objective and level variety, it is a great base for a Deep Rock themed survivor game. Especially at such a low price.",1708436360,1708437890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

But that is exactly why this is the best vampiresurvivoslike so far.  The vast majority of the other titles boil down to find the OP combo and then roflstomp the map with it.  

This game has way more nuanced balance than that and will keep you on your toes the whole time.  Even if you do get really lucky on powerups you still have to play well to win.  Also, all these games have a metaprogression ""grind"" to them but it feels way less grindy when you are constantly trying to overcome the next challenge (hazard level).  This game does this beautifully well as it will take you quite a while to work through the 5 hazard levels in the 3 different biomes.  

So in summary if you want a casual game where you just walk around the map clicking and can win easily then you won't like this game.

This is one of the first survivor games where I get bored after 1 run and need to stop:
- The weapons and upgrades are very bland (damage up, fire rate up, reload speed up, etc)
- The artifacts (items you get) also are very boring and meaningless
- The upgrades you buy between runs are so expensive and scale so poorly

However, the WORST offender to me is, before you unlock special upgrades for weapons (which makes them usable, not strong, USABLE), you have to upgrade them to level 12 in a single run.

It's an extremely good game, especially for early access... but is it perfect, no, it definitely needs improvement. For how small the price is, it's definitely worth it.

Levelling is slow, gameplay is repetitive and stages consist of 4 areas which is basically easy, medium, hard and hard with a boss at the end.

This is early access so it would be nice to see a few changes, for example magnets have a very low drop rate. It'd be good to see luck also affect drop rates (with more drop items added ofcourse)... although on another note high% luck doesn't exactly give you good loot either, majority of the time you get common when levelling up.

Stage timing is basically locked at the rounds, the boss always stays with the hordes you need to kill to level up. It's easy to complete a dive with level 50 or below characters if you just focus on a single gun. If you focus on multiple, you'll simply end up dying on the second area. It's almost a mix of too hard if you want to have fun versus extremely easy to ace the game if you play it the boring meta way.

Endless rounds? - Could be a cool implementation idea, would definitely solve the lacklustre base gameplay, however, with the options for guns, enemies etc after 30 minutes you'd get bored as there's no challenge. 

Challenges - Currently 3 challeneges per map plus the random collect 20 x, 12 x, 6 x... same things same amount blah blah blah, It;d be nice to have extra challenges maybe a challenge menu (could be implemented into the milestones?) daily, weekly, monthly challenges. DRG is a mining game, community mining challenges, mine 1mil morkanite?

Skins -Yes yes, I know, fuck skins, but they add personalisation like when you got to change the colour of your neons in NFS back in the day. Anyway, the gold supported skin is activated via Settings > 3rd tick box. However, it would be nice to see an actual skin customisation menu. Don't forget this doesn't have to be as in depth as something like fortnite, apex or character customisation in games like black desert etc. It'd just be nice to change the look of your character (a bit like DRG) and also how enemies look since each stage and area has the same enemies. Would also be cool to see some bullet animation, electric colours?

Minerals - Gold extremely common, nitre not so common, pearls etc rare.

Market - Could be cool to see this change on a day by day basis instead of it being a flat rate of 400 buy 200 sell

Achievements - Again, it'd be nice to see the steam achievements line up with the milestones in game, there are many more milestones in comparison. Also a tracking feature?

Maps - I really hope they release more than 3 maps for this game. Understand there's more than one hazard level but I think everyone would love more than 3.",1708431692,1708431692,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I felt I ""had to"" buy it. I hoped I was not making a mistake. For the current price, I cannot imagine anyone at least ""trying"" this title. The value is definitely there.

So far, I have no complaints. DRG: Survivor feels like that perfect ""power fantasy"" type of experience one may look for in reading manga/watching anime like One Punch Man and My Hero Academia, or playing games like God of War and Warframe.

Every time I'm in the midst of a run, and I unlock some uber (Legendary) upgrade, or deal an unsightly amount of damage, decimating thousands of ""bugs"" (they're also referred to as aliens) in this heist-like mine adventure where I try to get in, genocide, and get out, as efficiently as possible - at every level, I can't help but feel the game has especially capitalized upon one virtue of action entertainment: ""Spectacle.""

I love some of the deeper levels of customization that are available.

Choosing between elemental and kinetic damage, between status and crit, between specializing in a damage-type, or specializing in weapon-types (all of which synergize with different characters/classes), I feel as though there's always a reason to choose a particular class and go for a specific build.

Currently, I do not feel compelled to ""get that same build I did before"" with a particular class, which is excellent, as that sort of compulsion where there seems to be ""no better/as effective/nowhere near comparable"" build for a character bogs down gameplay and lends toward the feelings of monotomy that have me unceremoniously abandoning roguelite/roguelike games like this, or in other genres/genre blends.

I am definitely curious to see how they deepen the gameplay, seeing whether the stats, guns, and upgrades can get zanier, more creative, become more impactful/aweinspiring, and have higher ceilings that aren't merely ""higher"" but have a sense of weight to them that makes purchasing more powerful choices meaningful, rather than the trite and foregone circumstance of ""I'm choosing this more powerful buff because the game is more difficult now and I'm facing more powerful foes.""

In other words, that sense of ""earning"" the spectacle, the progression, and the loot is a fine line, and it breaks whenever every choice/a substantial set of choices becomes generic, weightless, and/or hopelessly routine.

Where I am in progression, I currently feel a bit ""stuck"" and am resorting to replaying older levels to grind for resources so I can advance in my overworld progression tiers and, hopefully, become powerful enough to take on some of the ever more challenging ""Hazards"" (higher difficulty runs) of which there are 5 tiers of Hazard per Biome (there are three biomes currently).

The grind aspects of games are the parts that have always typically made me a ""one and done"" type of player in MMOs/MMORPGs as the monotony weighs heavy on me before long.

The ""nuance"" of such experiences dries up and the ""game"" starts to feel like a payless job. That sort of effect is something that gatekeeps such games into becoming the prime choice for only the hardiest, most hardcore fans who relish the gameplay loop's grind plateau.

I personally cannot find my way into that mindset. If I can recommend anything, the developers of DRG: Survivor may want to consider implementing systems to rid the onset of ""grind"" that many games engender to keep up the fun for players who are not party to that toll.

One such recommendation I can suggest is using the resource system as a means of modifying certain options in-game. For instance, some of the resources that go toward overworld progression can be used to reroll certain options with effects that spending gold does not provide. This would be essential, especially when overworld progression is either maxed out, or is in a period of stagnation where upgrades are getting expensive. One thing I criticize with certain games is how particular resources one routinely grinds for become obsolete, or altogether useless, due to progression (becoming too powerful), migration (resources are no longer viable in a new region), or longevity of the game (newer resources are more favored than the older sets/varieties). DRG: Survivor can keep the soul of its progression alive by gradually shifting ""why"" one is grinding for the resources, as opposed to funneling them all into one system that will eventually cap out.

Unfortunately, I can see the end of the game coming up, somewhat. Once every weapon/mod/artifact is unlocked, and every biome is complete, I don't see a reason to come back to this as the gameplay loop has this one game mode it currently features in, and nothing besides that. At the very least, a ""survival"" mode would be nice, to see how long one can survive and overcome waves of ""bugs"".

I see other players are hungry for a co-op mode. I don't know if that was present in the prior rendition of this game, but I can see that happening if the levels expands, with a gameplay shift in a mode that resembles more of either a survival game, or a team vs. team vs. team dynamic, where cooperation becomes key.

Destiny released a mode where it's P vs. P vs. E (player versus player versus environment), where players' teams compete through their successes against the environment. That sort of mode could be excellent with this gameplay.

Anyway, I ultimately love this game and am looking forward to seeing how this shapes up through its early access offering. Much love, and luck, to the developers. You have a special game here and I am thrilled to have bought it.",1708429345,1708429345,True,0,1,0.472027987241744995,0,True,False,True

People are comparing it to ""Survivors""-games (aka Bullet Heaven) and it has this branding in its name, so it's not unreasonable to expect just another clone, but Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor mixes the genre with a great difficulty ramp, every run on Hazard 4 and 5 feels so tense and is actually difficult!
Most Bullet Heaven games let you make some choices and by the end of every run you absolutely annihilate everything, this only happens here with certain weapons+overclocks on lower difficulties after unlocking some of the meta progression.

I actually would've loved, at least some guns that require aiming beyond ""shoots in move direction"" / ""shoots behind you"", but I hope they'll introduce that with an upcoming patch.

Good content for early access + insane potential for full release = immediate buy

[h2] Long Version [/h2]
[b] Qualifications: [/b]
[list]
    [*]Brotato Abuser
    [*]Soulstone Survivors Enjoyer
    [*]Vampire Survivors Enjoyer (mostly on mobile now after the graphics gave me brain dmg)
    [*]Really liked God of Weapons
    [*]In love with Halls of Torment

[b] Integrity: [/b]
[list]
    [*]Never played DRG
    [*]Idk these guys
[/list]

So, take this as an objective review from a guy who loves bullet-hell.

First of all, the game is really really fun. Even in its current state, you can spend many hours having fun and trying out new things. Even though it is in early access, I do believe it has good content to keep you busy for a good while. I liked how they added new things/mechanics to the genre which is always a plus and on top of all of this, the game's graphics are sweet.

Secondly, if you take a look at all the negative reviews, they are either bad players crying about something so that it gets removed OR they say the game lacks content and variety etc. Guys, it is an early access game that just literally got released. And has any of you seen the roadmap- like hello? It is a good thing to point out the missing elements, suggesting improvements etc. but giving a thumbs down? C'mon..

[spoiler] ALSO, the avg playtime of negative reviews is around 5 hr. There are only a handful of them being 20+ or 30+ at the time of writing this review [/spoiler]

Thirdly, the content. As you can tell from the About section, there are 4 dwarves, each dwarf has classes and starting weapons. You combine 3 more weapons from the choices you are given into a 4-weapon kit. You kill monsters, you level up, you pick upgrades for your character and for the weapons. The weapons get powerful upgrades once you reach certain checkpoints called overclocks. Pretty standard, solid bullet-hell foundation. You also get side quests to pick up flowers and stuff, which reward you with exp and gold. Additionally, you can dig resources off the map by just simply walking and/or while running away from monsters, which adds a good layer of depth to the gameplay.

Now, here are my humble suggestions:

[list]
    [*]More bosses
    [*]More artifacts
    [*]More overclocks
    [*]More dwarves
    [*]More classes
    [*]More biomes
    [*]...
[/list]

Wait, they have all that in the roadmap- How 'bout dat.

On a srs note: it would be really nice to have things like Banish and Lock for the level-up upgrades to simply remove them from the pool or lock one in to pick up for the next level up.

Keep up the great work guys, looking forward to the updates!

Survivor is rough around the edges and has some growing pains to get through but overall shows a lot of promise. Designed with a faster pace in mind and keeping the pressure on so you have minimal time to think and react to incoming threats Survivor feels different from the obvious inspiration that is Vampire Survivors. Stages are tight and advance quickly as you kill more and more glyphids The longer you take to complete the objective for that stage the more difficult the glyphids get to kill.

Adapting elements from Galactic feels like a natural fit so far though options do feel a bit on the limited side. Overclocks, secondary objectives, various weapons, and minerals make a return filling out various roles you'd expect for each. There's even a few new types of weapons here which I hope give some inspiration for Galactic. I particularly enjoy going full construct with the Engineer freeing me up to focus on mining and resource gathering.

Enemy variety and stage objectives are the same across all three available maps and those don't offer too much variety from one to the next minus map specific features which don't do a whole lot to change up gameplay. Hopefully future updates will add more spic to this and help give each map a more unique identity along with enemies to change up tactics and stage hazards.

Upgrades can feel a bit bland at times too mostly relying on improving reload time, damage output, and rate of fire with a few dwarf specific upgrades tossed in like movement speed, mining rate, armor, and health. Overclocks do a great job at changing up how weapons play and tactics employed with them. One such example is turrets can be mobile, explode when expired, or you can get an additional charge to place down more turrets. Really hoping we see overclocks play a bigger role. 

Overall it's a fun experience for the price being asked. Gameplay definitely feels more focused on pick up and play for shorter sessions than other auto shooters but I appreciate the more fast paced nature of this. Unlike other games I always feel that sense of pressure and needing to plan ahead so I know where to go and how to deal with the endless swarms thirst for dwarf blood.

Never played such a game before and I might have missed out on a lot of fun. I'm only 3 hours in, but I already had plenty of fun and I'm hyped for what's to come. Given the current price, I don't see how that wouldn't be worth it. Even if you only played a single hour, it's cheaper than going to the cinema, for example :D
Anyway, I like the gameplay, the visuals, the voice lines and the simplicity. I'm a bit busy at the moment, but I can hop into this game for half an hour and shoot some bugs. What more could I wish for.

The only thing I'm currently missing: an overview over the weapons, it's perks/potential paths. So far, I was mostly running around while the game was happening. So I wish I could have a better understanding by reading about the weapons and stuff beforehand. But I'm certain it'll come.

Despite being mostly negative, I still am enjoying the game. It's a Good autoshooter survivorlike and for ten dollars of recognizing it's partially early access support, it's not a bad deal. In this review I'm being extremely critical because I'm a big fan of the genre, and I'm simply disappointed that it doesn't feel like much of a unique take on the genre is coming from Funday. If you're looking to get into the genre, I would start with other games first unless you're a big fan of DRG already.

+ Visuals are nice and clean, animations are satisfying and I'm impressed at how much can be rendered at 165fps consistently without issue. 

+ Guns are *generally* fun and game play as a whole scratches that itch that's supposed to be scratched in this genre.

+ I actually like that the stages are on the shorter side; it would make sense for duration to scale with higher hazards but I think it's a unique take to have this level-based system and I like that you're discouraged from infinitely kiting excessively kiting as a whole. 

+ Emphasis on really enjoying the level-system. I love playing certain floors in different ways and having to weight pros and cons to resources I choose to collect, when I'm collecting them vs fighting, etc.. I think that alone is what kept me playing.

> I see multiple comments about its difficulty, but I've dumped a lot of hours into the genre so I'm not encountering that as much. I will say, when I'm not playing a class with armor I feel like the damage of hits is a little wild.

> This is extremely true to the DRG universe, HOWEVER a part of me feels disappointment from that, too. It's hard to call it reused assets, but on the same token I wish something new was being imagined. Extension of the universe rather than reiterating what we already know. I may feel differently if I was already more in-love with the DRG universe as is, so it's definitely subjective, but I think it could have been more creative and it seems a little late to change this :(

- Progression at large is somewhat miserable. My biggest complaint, is that in order to fully ""realize"" a weapon, you need to upgrade it to level 12 in a single run to unlock its overclocks. When you successfully do that in the run, nothing happens- you don't even get to choose a single overclock. You just have this basic weapon with a bunch of bland stat upgrades that usually falls off in end-game, because you're not getting any of those powerful overclock effects. This creates a cycle early on quickly where it feels like you're often signing a run off to its death to attempt to stretch your luck and unlock overclocks for two weapons to actually enjoy those weapons in future runs and the game as a whole. If you're not doing that and taking a run seriously, you're constantly feeling conflicted between pursuing a stronger build and growing a weapon you have overclocks unlocked for and progressing to unlocking a gun's overclock's. If you're lucky, you're strong enough to do both and hail-mary spare gold for once your primary weapon is level 18.

On the topic of progression at large, mining unique materials is also not exciting or interesting. The material requirements are only existent on two upgrades, and the requirements jump so high you're certainly not upgrading your stats in meaningful ways. You usually do whatever's available, you can't focus stats that you find valuable or synergize with weapons you like or tend to use without being drastically inefficient. There's nothing else to spend it on; no way to improve or augment bosco, the way you interact with drop pods and supply pods, brewery, etc.

- Progression within a run is also not that interesting, everything is just reload speed/fire rate/damage, and guns aren't designed in a way to uniquely take advantage of these stats for the most part. You're usually just taking the highest rarity, and you're sometimes left with no agency on actually becoming powerful i.e being constantly offered reload speed for a weapon with already low reload speed, regardless of rarity. There's seldom upgrades for things that increase things like clip size, bullet quantity bullet spread, ability to pierce, bullet size, their reach, etc... Everything unique is restricted to overclocking, which as mentioned, is a pain to progress. And even so, a lot of overclocks are just extreme shifts in the aforementioned stats, nothing that remarkably changes gameplay or makes a weapon unique.

- There's not a lot of satisfaction in weapons and it's difficult to discern their individual impacts, all kinetic guns are gold bullets or silver pellets, so if you get any that overlap their individual impacts quickly get lost. This can also be a problem with the fire weapons, although I'd general say the status effect applying weapons are ALL more exciting to use simply because their visual impact is far more robust.

- Enemies are all mostly the same, you don't play around almost any of them in a unique or different way. The loop of using supply pods and detonators to take out swarms or elites got old incredibly fast, and that's all there is to do. They don't have targeters on explosions or the dreadnought's attacks, so it can feel a little difficult to understand when you're reliably hit or not hit.",1708417905,1708417905,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Drop pod leaving you behind happens way too often. You're fucked when it spawns on the other side of the crevasse & there are few areas inbeetween that need mining. 30 seconds won't cut it then.

Upgrading your weapons to max & THEN getting access to power ups is pretty dumb. It means you have to do a test run for each weapon first before you can actually bring it to a real run. 

Lack of content. Both area (maps) & combat wise. Areas could use more imagination. More interactive elements for example. Combat could be more fun if offered more ways to power up.

Playing early access, I loved the first hour, then it tapered off quite a bit- the first bit suffers a bit until you unlock overclocking and move past the first biome's initial 5 levels.

Once you've done that, it picks back up again, but I do think some - particularly more casual players - may disengage at that point.

I think for new players it could use a little more early-game introduction.  Compared to other games in the genre the exploding mobs aren't quite as obvious at first, and the distinction between red sugar and nitra (or really any other ores) could be more apparent.

That boss (and also the exploding mobs) I think also point to something that's fairly common that isn't present here, which is ground indicators. One can argue whether that's good or bad, but it certainly raises the difficulty somewhat comparatively. Even stopping to lure the Dreadnought into jumps, I'm struggling a little bit to guess its timing and precise destination; moreso when I do have to stay on the move due to swarms.

I also agree with some of the other comments that at least the gunner and the scout maybe aren't -quite- different enough as the first two classes you unpack. Conversely the engineer does change things up a bit, partly because you want to lean into using your turrets effectively. I've unlocked the fourth but haven't played it.


Pros:
-Some people noted it as a con, but I think the game's strength IS that it's constantly forcing you to decide whether to focus on fighting, mining, escaping, scouting, collecting. You kind of need all of those, and there are consequences to picking right or wrong, and you will inevitably die (probably many times) trying to get in just one more tap on a node.  If you don't enjoy constantly pivoting between those, and staying on your toes doing it, you probably won't like this game. It's just too fundamental to what it's trying to do imo.
-All in all - with some caveats - I think the general approach to the map is a good feature for the genre, and particularly the destructibility changing your options but I think there's still room to polish.

Cons:
-Gameplay loop is super shiny at first, but does start to wear thin a little bit until it picks back up again when you start getting more unlocks.
-If current tuning stays as is, I think they'll lose a lot of casual and even above-average players after the novelty wears off.
-Overclocking could unlock sooner
-Once in a while the map design is just kinda dumb. You won't constantly find yourself stranded on a peninsula during a swarm surge (or worse, swarm + dreadnought) but if you play long enough it's going to happen eventually. 
-Early game weapon options could be wider, and there's really not great weapon synergy compared to a number of other games in the genre.  I can live with it, but it's not a selling point.

On that point I think they either need to smooth out some of the oddities, or perhaps add some landmarks for wayfinding.  I generally navigate space IRL and in games very well, but I do find the samey RNG and color palette of the maps a bit too numbing.

Overall (at 6-7 hours) for a grade at this point I'd say 7.5/10, and imo worth the price. I think my favorite moment so far was picking a cosmetic weapon upgrade and the scout saying ""I love wasting my money on cosmetics!""

feedback:
[list]
[*]much, much larger maps to better utilize the unique mining mechanic 
[*]co op
[*]classes with a stronger identity that provide perks that upgrades can't easily replace, preferably with level scaling
[*]unlock conditions being more clear for additional classes
[*]reworked and balanced weapons, including overclocks and evolutions. some weapons sluggishly target monsters
[*]many more stages, and additional modifiers to challenge said stages (endless mode, boss rush, etc)
[*]way more bosses that preferably don't rely on a non-illuminated charge ability
[*]a more robust, deeper upgrade tree that affects the player dramatically more without requiring a huge grind for each milestone
[*]stronger, more immediately impactful builds. players are too weak for this subgenre of game. should you ever piece together a powerful build, there's little to no time left to enjoy it.

The new biomes create nice variety both in visuals and gameplay, and having all four classes available provides a lot more game to sink your teeth into.

What's going particularly well?
- good visuals, nice to look at
- gameplay feels good, the difficulty is well-tuned. swarms can be overwhelming, but become manageable as you find tricks and strategies to manage them.
- the weapons are well-implemented, both those from DRG and the new ones created just for this game. They are interesting and reasonably distinct from one another, despite there being quite a few.


What would I like to see change?
- I think the artifact system could use some more attention. Many of the boosts they provide are not particularly interesting, just increasing a stat conditionally or providing a small reward for some game action (finding extra gold while mining, for instance). It's not bad to have simple buffs available, but it feels like there's an opportunity here to make the gameplay deeper. The artifacts that give you buffs for standing still are an example of something a little more interesting, since they encouraged me to change the way I was playing. More stuff like that would be nice.

- I would also like to see some more variety among the weapon overclocks. Despite there being so many weapons in total, you have access to a limited pool depending on the class you're playing. The upgrades you get each level only increase your stats, so your four weapons and their OC's are the only strongly significant decisions you make in each run. It's not so bad that every run of a particular class feels totally the same, but there's not as much variety as I would like. Some of the OC's do cool things, but many times you get one that's just more damage and reload speed or something, which isn't really any different than the basic upgrades you're getting every level.

- The structure/pacing of missions could be more flexible. Currently the cadence of action from one run to the next is always very similar. It's an autoshooter, so you can't ever stop killing bugs. And since killing bugs is what advances the mission, no matter what you're doing you're making progress. And the end of a level is a hard limit, since the pod comes automatically and if you miss it it's game over. This means that each mission is always just about as long as the last one, finished at about the same character level. It would be nice if there was more variety to the pacing, and more variety to the objectives each level too. Maybe some of the machine events from DRG could inspire additional objectives and challenges to encounter. Maybe we could trigger the pod manually, rather than being forced to move on to the next level immediately.


Overall, the game is fun and polished enough to feel worth the price, despite not being done yet. It looks and feels great to play, and my biggest complaint is just that there's not more of it. All the game needs is some more variety and build depth/options. If Funday continues to add content of a similar quality to what's here already, then this already very good game will become incredible.

The widely mentioned criticism about bland upgrades is also true.  Kind of hard to recommend this at this stage

Edit: I've played it quite a bit more, my earlier point stands still, the grinding is annoying. But you do actually have different builds with different characters that are based on what weapons you pick and what overclocks you pick for those weapons. Its just that you have to grind a lot to get them

The game does not respect your time, which is very annoying. The upgrades might seem bland and they are but they aren't equivalent to each other. It depends on the weapon what is better. Like for instance damage is not always the best if your specific weapon has a very long reload time for instance, so you have some nuance there. A lack of any tutorial or info kind of hides this at first and ""grind to level 12"" hides it even more.

-some grinding involved
-weapons / items are heavily RNG based like all the others
-so far no way to really guarantee items you want to use
-some character beginner perks are really nice for its class and then the others are really bad
e,g, driller loses mining speed with its other subclasses.

-When leveling up you get choices for weapon buffs. At certain level intervals (always the same) you get a new weapon to pick. Sometimes you might want an item not for damage but for utility like cryo grenade. I think all classes can get access to all weapons you unlock but each class and its subclass has different preferred items to pick from that have a higher % chance of showing up. Its not fun wasting your 100+ gold to try and get something like cryo grenade on a class that doesnt normally use grenades, and the rolls repeat items/weapons you just saw over and over instead. resource is precious. You dont get 1000 gold each stage. You might get 100-150. OR even less. at 15 gold a shop roll, you waste your end of round buff money.

There's a lot of cool ideas here but the problem is the core loop doesn't lend itself to interesting builds. 
The mining is a great mechanic and I enjoy the level based structure. I also enjoy how there's a massive variety of weapons and they all have augments when upgraded.
The issue is that none of the upgrades really lean into any specific type of build outside of maybe damage types, and even then it's minor. In other Survivors games you can make fun builds around say landing crits and the upgrades would empower that build (health on crit, crits explode, etc. etc.). This lends itself to experimentation and lets you try to min/max a specific playstyle.
DRG:S's upgrades are almost entirely just raising stats a small percentage without any real synergy. It's dull and doesn't feel rewarding. 
I do think they could fix this. The core is great, it's mostly just the upgrades that suck. By tweaking this system I think this could be a fairly unique survivors clone with it's other mechanics. Sadly, as is the game gets boring pretty quick and upgrades are extremely grindy. 
So yeah, maybe after a few updates it'll be ready to rock and stone, but for now I don't think it's worth the asking price when stuff like Halls of Torment exist.",1708401434,1708401434,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

That said, you should know what to expect from the game and the genre that it emulates, and depending on your expectations, you should maybe wait until it comes along a little further. For $10 ($9 at launch), it's not bad. However, it is clearly not a ""finished game"", it's not buggy (for me at least no crashes), there's probably about 20-40 hours of grindy gameplay to unlock everything there is to see, but all of the areas for improvement means you'll probably want to be willing to reset your progress to fully enjoy the final retail version of the game.
The visuals are good, very faithful to the designs of the original DRG game, sound design is decent, many familiar voice call-outs and new lines using the same voice actors, same or similar pulsing soundtrack as swarms come in.
Many of the weapons feel underwhelming at first but upgrading and learning how to use them effectively is part of it, the other part is that some of them do just kinda suck.
This game does not have multiplayer, is not a twin-stick shooter, and would probably be better if it did have both, but it does not advertise itself as such. It is a spin-off in a currently fashionable vein of the ""Survivor"" auto-shooter, which are all mindless timesinks with periodic dopamine hits for unlocking something or other each run, so you should go in expecting that, for now.
In summary, looks nice, plays fine, currently low on content and shallow meta, but fun as long as you are unlocking stuff. It does have the bare essence of DRG, hopefully it can be shaped into something that sets it apart from the generic autoshooter.

They fill the screen with exploding mobs. The power ups are absolute trash. Have these devs ever played a survivor game? Nothing is powerful. You run like a fool around kting super-sponge mobs around and get cornered continuously. You can't kill anything because every power up is garbage. Where are the cool weapons? 
A pistol or a rifle? What? Where are the flame throwers, AoE? Anything at all that is actually interesting? Why does the smallest trash mob take 4-5 shots to kill when it should be one? You do not get powerful in the game, not in the first 5 hours at least and that's all I can stomach.

The grind is ridiculous too. You finally unlock a new character and ...he is basically the same but walks slower and has better armor. Boring. Boring. Boring. A 'legendary' power up is 50% reload time? lol.

Speaking of which, a bullet hell where you are running away all the time and waiting for your weapons to reload. What? In a bullet hell, my idiot dwarf is standing there doing literally nothing as a horde comes in to kill him. Fire your gun FFS! Oops, gotta spend what, 15 levels putting points into nothing but reload speed until you fire more than once in a while. Slow, sluggish. Boring.

30 seconds to escape! Dumbest idea ever. I just killed a boss, loot explodes, but if I stay to clear trash and get it i die(?) /facepalm. Question for the devs: why can't I just go to the pod when ready? Why are you constantly harassing and shoving me to the next thing? Just let players play for goodness sake, get off my back with the endless hoards and timers and 'mobs get stronger' for some reason.

I thought with some unlocks the game would improve but it's just boring to play. I have felt not once a  moment of excitement with my 4+ hours trying. Most boring survivor power ups I ever saw. 

The whole 'take damage because your pixel touched theirs' thing is really old now too. New games do it much better. Look at Soul Survivors for example. The mobs actually have to attack and hit you to score damage, you can dodge at last second, it adds a feeling of skill and responsiveness. This is just lazy, touch mobs get hurt crap.

The problem is I already have VS, I've had it for a couple years now and DRGS offers very, very, little to an already stale formula. Yes there is mining, being able to tunnel through rock and mine minerals is a nice side objective in addition to the usual kiting activities. But it's not enough.

This bullet heaven or whatever the genre is called nowadays has plenty of games in it and they have all iterated upon VS in some way. Be it including strafing or full on manual shooting and reloading. DRGS has only brought with it the ability to hump the walls to get some extra resources. Yes you can tunnel past a horde in the short term but the ""islands"" of rock you chew through are never really big enough for this to be a significant strategy. Guns feel bland and ineffective for the genre they are in too, with many having incredibly cumbersome firing patterns and long reloads that feel punishing when you have no control over them. Upgrades likewise feel boring, outside of overclocks all you are getting is simple % stat changes. 15% damage, 10% reload. You don't ever feel strong, merely that you are at best keeping pace. In fact a lot of the overclocks themselves are also just basic modifiers but bigger, very few actually change how you might play the game, a stark contrast from DRG where even balanced overclocks can significantly shake up a weapon.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the fact this game actually has some challenge and I wish we could get swarms as big and omnipresent in DRG itself.

Which really is the crux of what I don't like about this game, it doesn't feel like a DRG spinoff. It feels too much like an inferior version of VS with a superficial gimmick tacked on. 
You aren't getting lost in caves, because they are always just small rectangles with a few small islands of digable rock or small impassable pits dotted about. 
You aren't doing various mining and industry tasks, all you have is clearing waves until a boss spawns then killing it so you can move to the next rectangular arena. The best you get is mining some morkite occasionally.
You aren't using creative weapons to kill bugs and in fact have no direct control over them at all.

The game feels agonisingly passive in how you play it. You kite bugs, hump walls and choose between 3 basic % buffs to one of your guns every few seconds. I hope eventually they do actually try to make this game be a little more interactive and a lot more like it's big brother as a true spinoff rather than a clone of an already existing game. But I had these same complaints back when the demo came out and practically nothing has changed between that and early access.

So first off It's a bit of a unique hybrid mix between survivors and roguelike but a bigger emphasis on roguelike over the typical survivors, keep that in mind everyone before jumping in thinking its as easy as vampire survivors, its definitely not as you reach haz 4/5

Pros
Meta progression upgrades, even the aesthetics are awesome, definitely looks and feels like DRG with the maps, weapons and voiceovers you'll find a sense of comfort and familiarity from DRG itself.

Cons

Mid
-Hazard difficulty spike from 3 into 4-5 is insane, could need an adjustment
-Weapons - some shine on its own, some are outright garbage unlike DRG where all are viable, and some need overclocks to shine. Examples - certain fixed directional weapons

Major
-Very Roguelike, unlucky spawns or lack of proper artifacts for some challenges ex. mining x amount of gold/nitra make it difficult/impossible to complete - good fix would be set amount of spawns until challenge is complete, bigger map or infinite scroll map(bigger map would fit DRG theme over inf scroll).
-Overclock - locking its fine for progression, but having it locked until you complete it then only getting access to it the next run is a buzzkill.

Minor
-Hazard difficulty spikes feel off 1-3 are fine but the jump to 4-5 feels like an absolute struggle.
-Lack of variety for overclocks, would love to see clean, more balanced and more unstable.
-Upgrades during run progression - lack oof/feel redundant especially when you start maxing out meta progress and the lack of a banish option, reroll is fine but it still triggering if you have bad RNG somehow get similar options within multiple rerolls
-Map spawn variety - Hollow Bough horrible offender, feels like only 3 variants spawn and they are all obnoxiously difficult 
Crystalline Caverns and Magma Core are excellent and balanced in comparison.
edit
-Boss - almost forgot just nitpicking, only 1 dreadnought type so far, and it only leaps, would like to see more variants and move sets.

""Bugs""

-No crashing yet, but chain reaction explosions and sudden spawn of exp and despawn of corpses trigger micro lag/stuttering/freezing which is terrifying for the run. Surprisingly no desync run ending-deaths.
-Some throwable grenades get stuck over unmined terrain and effectively do zero damage even bugs are in splash radius.
-Drop pod ramp can bug out and prevent access - triggering a game over as it leaves without you. (I've experienced both ways, one via diagonal orientation prevented me moving onto the ramp at the tip of edge, and the other being the ramp didn't pull me in like it does on some runs, and yes the green arrows disappeared meaning you are in range when far enough on ramp.)

Probably a few more i forgot note down, but honestly nothing too notable.

Overall though, while its still early access and needs a bit more polishing and tweaking i ""dig"" it
needs more time cooking as all early access do, but its been enjoyable so far, looking forward to future updates especially overclocks and map variety from DRG universe.

Misc
-Would love a roadmap to see what's being worked on next
-Optional Co-op - I wouldn't mind this but the game is perfectly fine on singleplayer as well.

will probably update as early access progresses

TL:DR wtf walloftext
Lots of potential for improvements, well polished for an early access game.

I have to say the art and audio are top tier for this genre. When measured against Vampire Survivors or really any other similar game, this one stands out. Nothing looks cheap and everything fits into the Deep Rock Galactic world. 

My main issue is progression. You level up during your run and choose upgrades as you go. After your run you bring gems and credits back to exchange for permanent upgrades. After 12 hours I've gotten absolutely sick of seeing the same upgrades for fire rate, mining speed, reload... It's the same handful of minor stat upgrades for every weapon and none of them feel significant. The majority of the weapon evolutions are also simply stat boosts for fire rate, damage, reload, or an option to change damage type. There are a few interesting ones but they are a rarity. There is no unlock I'm dying to get, there is no upgrade that feels like it's worthwhile to work towards. 

Lastly, the most heinous thing this game does is forget that this genre is about the 1 in 20 runs where the stars align and you get the perfect drops for an unstoppable build. That's the whole point. After this long with the game I still feel like I'm just barely getting out alive on almost every run. Maybe that's a part of the original game they felt it was important to include here, but where are the weapon combos? Where are the upgrades that are so amazing you suddenly ditch your whole strategy to focus on optimizing a new exciting item?

- The game is well priced, definitely feels like I got my money's worth. 
- Love the artstyle 
- Sound design is really good , so many of the weapons/enemies sound distinct which helps sort through the chaos. 
- Early on, progression is very fast and feels rewarding to play. 

Cons:
- Higher hazard levels are not balanced very well, hazard 3+ becomes a total slog to get through. The enemies are so strong and numerous that it feels almost luck-based. 
- Class/weapon balance needs tweaking. Driller feels almost pointless sometimes and gunner feels incredibly strong. Some weapons are must-picks (warthog, minigun) where others are must avoids (thunderbird drones, leadbursters).  
- Later on, progression is very slow and feels repetitive. 

Overall , the game is really fun for the first few hours and definitely worth a try. But it needs serious work for long-term enjoyment.

The power fantasy thus far is pretty meh.

Never really hit that zomg I'm a survivor god moment before death destroys you.

I understand mechanically that is not the end state for this game and it has more in like with Yet another zombie survivor than it does OG Vampire Survivors.

That said it is lacking the core mechanics that game gives you. Like the ability to aim some abilities.

Recommendations to make it better:
Refresh level up rewards and more mechanically interesting upgrade options not just %X to Y.

I.e. more stun, slow, Hazzard weapon variants.

Consider allowing aim controls for some weapons. Because often kiting a mob of enemies while mining leaves you shooting the wall.

But after playing it for a bit longer, I am just as hooked as with Vampires. The focus is just a bit different. It is less of a reverse bullet hell as with vampires, but more about making decisions and strategic play when considering to focus mining over killing or vice versa and when deciding on weapon builds.

The game can certainly use some more work when it comes to content diversity, but in an excellent state for a just started early access and less than 10€. And knowing how the devs treat Deep Rock Galctic, I am fairly optimistic, that this game will receive a lot of more love. Main things that I hope for are more content and more diversity in enemies/levels and possibly a couch coop mode like with vampire survivors at some point. I think some of the weapon upgrades could also use a bit more tweaking too. And the bosses certainly need more diverstiy. They are currently a one-trick-pony.

I read some reviews about people saying that the upgrades don't have enough impact. And in the first few hours, I felt the same. But once you unlock overclocks and put three of those in a weapon, this can drastically change. I ran around with a sniper boosted to insane crit damage levels and overclocks that basically made it a one-shot-all-shotgun. I killed the final boss in just a few seconds on Haz3. The weapon changed so much due to the overclocks.

I also love how the weapons and classes can have very strong upgrade synergies. I played a gunner variant that shoots additional bullets every 100 shots and skilled everything on attack speed and crit chance and damage. I also only selected weapons with lots of bullets per second. It absolutely shredded through hordes of enemies. 

Overall, the game starts out a bit slow at first (also because overclocks have to be unloced per weapon first). But once a few hours in, I cannot stop playing and want to try another build idea. It is in an excellent state for an early access game and costs not much more than my daily lunch.

Clearly the game needs more levels, more bosses and boss mechanics, more enemy types, weapons etc.

Takes about 5h to unlock all the characters and complete each of the levels, probably 10h - 20h to fully complete the content available on all difficulties, though its a little light on content and game mechanics its going to get repetitive and a bit boring at around the 10h mark.

Ghost Ship has done a great job constantly adding content to Deep Rock over time, so I would expect this will be a proper Early Access title with proper developer support moving into release 1.0, especially as this game essentially cross promotes Deep Rock core game quite effectively.

Pacing - DRG Survivor felt a bit slower paced? you had the ability to somewhat control your run as by the end you could delay and spend some time levelling up, as long as you could manage to keep an ever strengthening horde at bay that is, but it was up to you. I get the feeling each round might be shorter than it was in the demo now too? Could just be me.

Class balance - Driller mains feel incredibly weak, while in theory it should scale to amazing by the way you can keep adding more beams, they do almost no damage to start with, so it goes from terrible to almost passable - never to the level of pure destruction you can get out of a gunner or scout with the only a little luck in your OCs.

[b]Basic Gameplay Loop[/b]
Basic loop is select your character, pick one of its load-out sets, choose a map, select the difficulty (hazard level) and load into the run.

A run is 5 maps. 5th map will have a boss. Maps are not big and are half filled with rocks/ore that cannot be traversed until mined. Being next to something that needs mined will automatically start mining it. There are ~7 ores that are used as currency for in-run (temporary) and out-of-run (permanent) upgrades.

Your weapons fire automatically when enemies are within range and line-of-sight. Killing enemies (and other actions, based on upgrades) drops XP orbs and you pick them up to collect it. When you level up, you get 3 upgrade options you can choose from for free. These are generally damage, reload speed, or fire rate for one weapon or a weapon type (e.g. all, projectile, cold). At certain levels you also unlock one of 2 RNG new weapons - at 25 you get your 4th and final weapon.

After each map, you go to the store, which is just several upgrade options that you use one of two currencies to buy as many as you want or can afford. All upgrade screens can be re-rolled using a currency.

As is standard with the genre, new items are unlocked by completing ""Milestones"". Milestones in this game generally involve hitting a player/class/weapon level or by collecting  a given amount of an ore.

[b]Review[/b]
This is an uninspired, genre-chasing, RNG-heavy, waste of time, cash grab.

Lots of balancing issues - clear winners and losers. There was obviously no baseline that the devs calculated out and aimed for. Since they can't even bother to simulate their own game, it is no surprise that the RNG systems are not handled well, either. Doesn't really feel fun from the start. Constantly oppressive. This is not a sit back and chill game until you are well into the mid-game. Seems to be one of those ""it gets fun after 20 hours"" games, unfortunately.

Maps are way too small. The ""5 map with boss on 5th"" pattern was boring by the 3rd run. Too easy to get cornered, especially during a ""randomly"" occurring swarm. Suicide-bomber enemies suck in all games, but worse here due to their excessive speed of exploding, with a barely perceptible shaking beforehand, and no apparent distance-based damage falloff. Oh, and they often come in packs so a single pack can 1-shot you.

RNG BS restricting progression is not content. RNG is not gameplay. They need to do a much better job. They need to steal more from other good games. ""Winning"" feels like random chance, instead of skill and strategy. Permanent upgrades you get outside of a run are more important for completing a run than skill. Everything must be in perfect balance or the run is not fun. There is no reason to have MMO-style rarity for upgrades.

Map/hazard unlock objectives are not presented in a logical order for normal completion. Upgrades and unlocks need re-balanced across the board. Map objectives are boring, don't add any real variety to the core loop, feel like they force you to rush through maps, and just don't add anything relevant or fun. Artifacts are worth more used as Rods from God than as exciting upgrades. Reload speed is too powerful, meaning the base reload speeds are oppressively slow.

Too much of the map area is blocked off and requires mining to clear - this is a majorly significant difficulty spike from similar games, where most of the play area is open space. Mining doesn't feel anywhere near rewarding enough given the time and risk (and upgrades) it takes. Base mining speed is oppressive and doesn't feel good until upgraded to +50%. Map/objective timers are oppressive. Enemy spawn points and rates are oppressive.

Weapons are boring, unimaginative, and rarely help provide agency to the player. Virtually all upgrades are simple stat changes. Having multiple rarities for each stat upgrade adds more useless RNG into the mix. It's pointless and does nothing to add to the fun. Many of the ""overclocks"" (after hitting certain upgrade levels, you get super upgrades) have negative attributes tied to them, which is not fun.

Runs feel too fast. A baseline of 25+ levels is not enough for the amount of trash RNG you can run into. XP orbs are significantly more difficult to retrieve than in most games in the genre. The combination of movement speed, timers, and oppressive enemies will force you to leave a significant amount of XP on the floor when you leave the map.

Games are supposed to be fun, but I've written ""oppressive"" way too many times for that to have any application to this game.",1708374289,1708379501,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game does not have tutorials or directions - yes, you have to figure things out just like in Deep Rock. However, there are three main mechanics to be aware of:

1. Mining - You have to run and collect minerals like gold to meet not only the level missions, but you need that gold to pay for permanent upgrades you apply after each run completes. 

2. Firepower - The second mechanic, one more common to other games in the genre but not the same as Deep Rock is doing - you have to modify your loadout each time you level up. You also will do this between missions in your run. Once you finish the map's objectives, the resources you collected fund your hunger for weapons or other mechanic upgrades. 

3. Mission Objectives - These will be things like ""collect 20 bits of gold"" or ""upgrade X gun to Y level"" and once you finish, you unlock something new that will show up in your games. There are a ton of things you can unlock. Even being in EA - I feel in my time with the game I barely unlocked anything. 

Perfect Steam Deck game - and this will be an obsession for years to come. This is a game that is played over a long time as the upgrades do not come cheap or easy to obtain. You have to work at it, but the game is a lot of fun, so you will love to put in the time. 

If you are on the fence but the game and play one round. If you hate it, return it. You will have to stick with things just like in Deep Rock - that game also requires you to play over a long time and slowly opens up with more and more options, guns, and skills, and this game does the same.",1708379377,1708379377,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

-The dreadnought is way too strong in this current iteration, honestly just not fun at all when I know I'm coming up to it.

- [b]guard rails for the level progression,[/b] third map on hazard 3 should be a bit harder then second map on hazard 3 but i got my pp smacked 5 times in a row which was very un-epic. so i forced myself to play the lower levels to grind my permanent upgrades. Felt like a lame move but once the gameplay started it was all gucci again. It would be nice to have some warning like ""you are underleveled"" idk. lame casual gamer thought probably. 

- [b]explain how earning credits works?[/b] its an important part of the game and i dont know how the f it works.

You end up making games shorter by investing in metaprogression and at the same time you earn less metaprogression currency because you don't have enough time to run around and mine minerals. Trying to NOT KILL enemies in order to buy yourself enough time to mine kills the fun of the game.
2.  Difficulty scaling is just stupid. Hazard 1 without metaprogression is way harder than Hazard 5 with metaprogression.

No crazy weapons or synergies. You never get to feel like you can actually take on the absolute hordes of enemies coming at you. It’s literally just constant running from them trying to dig painfully slowly through the rock trying to find your objective for the given level.
The upgrades are boring. The rogue-lite increasing of stats is expensive and such small increases as to basically be meaningless.

While I think it's fun, I don't think it is as fun as its parent game. Nor does it grab me like Vampire Survivors does. DRG:S is just so much simpler than VS was, even at release. 

It definitely needs more boss variety, co-op, and changes to the classes to make them fit niches. I also feel like even haz 1 is way overtuned, given that the game can go up to haz 5.

2. Pace. Way too slow. Walking is slow, mining is slow, reloading is slow.
3. Level endings. Just give me some more time other than 30 seconds to grab everything i left behind so i can feel rewarded.

Currently game is rage inducing. Big bad piercing railgun or the grenade fired at one single random enemy instead of big pile of enemies chasing me and running through hoops to collect the xp left behind made me ragequit the game.

Also some more information about game mechanics should be included, what does leveling up weapons do other than unlocking overclocks or what does changing weapon type to electic or cold do, what are their benefits? I need to google them to get some answers.

I know this is an early access game, and this is my early access review which is hopefully subject to change.

Your always on the run, always 1 bad mining spot away from death. Some enemies are just meaty and take soooooo much time to kill. And the maps in this game have edges, or ends. So in a pinch you cant keep running away, you will hit a dead end. 

And the sidequests it gives you are occasionally borderline impossible. It will give you a side quest like ""Gather Morkite"" it will only place 2 or 3 morkite veins on the map, meaning unless you are JUST looking for morkite, its impossible to gather enough before the mission ends. Many times i've burned my way through 1/2 of the map, dont have enough of the side quest item, and am now faced with this decision. I can either:
1. Run back where i've killed waves and waves of enemies to gather exp that they have dropped, so I can level up, the only possible way i'll survive future waves. 
Or
2. Explore the other half of the map, finding the side quest items, but abandoning all the exp the enemies have dropped.

If you like VS, but you have not played DRG, you will probably still like this game, but while staying true to the DRG source material, this game has a few differences. Differences that I feel make it better than just a DRG skin over the exact same VS game play.

I read through a bunch of reviews before I purchased this game. After spending some time with this game, I think the negative reviews I saw were from people that are not familiar with DRG.

- The mining mechanic here is great and can be used to your advantage to funnel your enemies and make strategic decisions about how to exit an area.
- Yes, the enemies are a little spongy, especially early on, but it makes the mechanic above all the more useful
- Look, this isn't VS. Just like in DRG, the goal is to complete your mission and GTFO. The longer you stay, the harder it gets, especially after your tunnels are gone from explosions, etc. The tunneling aspect is a big reason why you WANT to change the floor. If you consider all the floors in their entirety, then a run is just as long as VS, if not longer. The people complaining about short levels have not done a completed run. You go through multiple floors and then fight the boss. I guarantee that anyone complaining about level length have not spent much time with the game.
- The miner quips are great, especially if you like DRG. You can turn them off if you want. 

They made a great bullet hell game and remained true to all the DRG elements. It really is a fantastic game and it sells for less than $10.",1708356455,1708359609,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It looks and sounds great, handles nicely.
Game loop is short, which I like but with almost no meaningful progression.
Most weapons feel about as effective as throwing gravel, barring a few that feel actively unpleasant to use. Some of this may get sorted since damage feels profoundly lopsided in the bugs direction.
Right now just feels like grinding up levels to unlock weapons that aren't fun.
And I know games use more complicated calculations in the background to get to actual bonuses but whats on the card to whats actually applied feel particularly egregious.

what I don't like:
- the meta progression is kinda meh. You don't really get interesting upgrades. Just a very slow 1% bonus per upgrade for a long grind

- the levels are too short

- The classes have very minor differences. 
- There are no builds (you can change a weapon's damage type; it does almost nothing). Every else is %attribute goes up.
- There is a weapon overclock system like in DRG but the effects are boring (just number changes) and you need to essentially waste a run to unlock the overclock system on a weapon by weapon basis. 
- The difficulty is weird for a survivor type game. You are swarmed by enemies that spawn relentlessly but are given no effective tools to deal with them (see also: no builds). You are encouraged to run and mine paths through the walls to stay ahead of them (which is cool and unique in this genre) but the maps are tiny and eventually you have nowhere to run, enemies are all around you and you don't have the means to make a path (because there is no aiming your weapons so you are at the mercy of the rng. Also, again, no builds).
- It's neither a relaxing 'low effort, number go up' nor a 'super skill based, agonize over every choice' type of game. Maybe it changes after 20 more hours of unlocking minor 2% buffs to movement or whatever, but i don't really care to find out.
- The final boss is agressively dull. It has one (1) attack pattern, deals entirely too much damage and it doesn't interact with you or your character in any significant way. Are you scout or driller? Doesn't matter it's the same fight either way. See also: no builds.
- The DRG setting feels like a coat of paint.

Deep Rock Galactic: Survivors is the brand-new installment in the DRG series. It takes inspiration from Vampire Survivors and adds its own DRG twist on it- with overclocks, an addictive gameplay loop, the eye candy that is the art style, and the unique builds, you will play for hours because of reasons both good and bad. 
I will be very lenient with my opinions since this game released a couple days ago, AND is in Early Access.

This game... This game is pretty fun. It doesn't hold a candle to its parent game at the time of writing this, but it is a very good time nonetheless. It has a lot of the traits that the original game did. Charm? Check. Addictive gameplay? Check. (more on the gameplay later.) A good art style? Check! I love how the game looks, and the cute twists and alternate designs on the monsters are executed well. It almost makes you forget that you bash lead into their skulls in the original game.

So how is the gameplay? If you've played Vampire Survivors before, you know how this goes. Dwarf shoots at buggy, buggy die, die give you blue thing, get enough of blue thing and you level up, allowing you to upgrade yourself or get new weapons for your character. The loop consists of:
-start
-kill buggy, as mentioned above
-kill enough buggy and you get swarm
-after swarm, you get beacon which you need to clear a specific area for it to land. I don't have a negative or positive opinion about this part.
-more buggy killing
-big boss
-kill big boss
-oh noes, you have 30 seconds to return to the drop pod!
-get in
-go deeper into the mines of Hoxxes
After each return, you can spend the Nitra and Gold that you have found on your way to get even more upgrades. This is a nice alternative for the late-game where leveling up is hard.
There are also artifacts, which are like the items from Risk of Rain and the sequel and the Risk of Rain remaster, if you have played any of those games. They provide a specific benefit.
Remember how, at the very start of the review, I mentioned overclocks? You can get them when you have a specific amount of upgrades for one weapon. Overclocks are for that one weapon respectively, and are specially designed for that one weapon to improve your loadout. There's also the hazard system, but I don't think I need to go into too much detail about that. It just adds a risk-reward system, just like in DRG.

However, behind all of this lies some bad things about the game. First of all, the unbalanced overclock level could have been lessened by 2-3 levels. After a while, getting levels becomes tough, just like Vampire Survivors; the game DRG: Survivor was inspired by. And there's no problem with this, but I feel like those extra 2-3 levels feel like padding. There are also no cosmetics, something that I ABSOLUTELY ADORED in the original game. Now, it just feels like I'm playing as the same guy as everybody else instead of getting my own drip. (dlc cosmetics are cool though) Also? No beer. Tsk tsk. I don't know how it can fit into the game, but add it. PLEASE. Also, we need more original voicelines. This is an issue I also had when I played through the playtest.

You will enjoy most of ur time playing this game at low hazards.

-Hazard 4 above-
-Mobs are way too tanky for no reason and you don't even get the payoff because most of the time the EXP you get at killing those tanky mobs are little to none and sometimes you can't even get the EXP shards coz you're either low health fighting the consecutive swarms while getting to the drop pod. by the end you're gonna get triggered as to the amount of EXP shards you left on the stage.
-Mining is way too slow and is a pain on high hazard stages because you're either too busy fighting consecutive swarms or getting the EXP shards of said swarm which can take the whole duration of the stage because again they are too tanky for no reason especially on the earlier stages of the map where you have no upgrades and overclocks to your weapons.
-Drop pods need to be longer or let players make the choice as to when to move on to the next stage. Really infuriating as to how many resources you can miss whether EXP Shards or rocks.
-Needs a lot more movement artifacts/items, characters are too slow imo (except the scout ofc)
-Some weapons are utter dogshit like those cryo drones and electro, the only good drone is the viper because they actually follow the enemy, seems like an odd choice in design the 2 former drones you need to manually place your character to make them hit the enemy but even if they hit for like a poot of damage.
-Leveling takes way too much time.
-The main upgrades that they give you are small at max levels. idk why they are too stingy with the numbers to the buffs they give (16% mining speed and 24 exp% at max level) like bro thats nothing.
Overall, I can recommend this game if you only play at low hazards. Lot of potential once they fixed the balance at hazard 4  above, only viable way to clear is with scouts with cryo zhukovs (which you need to pray to RNG gods to get those overclocks).

I'm only on Hazard level 3 and already feeling like I don't want to progress anymore because it feels meaningless and tedious. Most upgrades are +% damage, +% fire rate, +% reload time reduction etc. (BORING!)

Then you get the cooler things like the overclocks which actually change damage types (No in game description of what damage types actually do though, whats the difference between fire and acid dots? Not a clue!) and a few of them add/change functionality of a weapon (FUN!).

At the moment there seem to be 3 maps that have the same end boss, same enemy types and only differ visually except for the first map having some breakable crystals, the second map having a bit of lava on the ground that hurts you if you walk on it and the third map having annoying vines blocking your path.

Meta progression also seems meh, mining is kinda fun and gives you something to hunt for on the maps, but spending a couple of runs worth of minerals on ""+1% crit chance"" doesn't feel very fun either.

My tip is to hold off on this game for 6 months or so and see if they've turned it around, because right now there are both better and cheaper alternatives out there.",1708352064,1708352064,False,154,7,0.748687505722045898,2,True,False,True

The stages could last twice as long too. Drop pod should be a minute. What this feels like is Hyper mode from Vampire Survivors.
I want to take it easy and obliterate my enemy when I choose hazard 1. I tried hazard 2 and it feels the same as hazard 1. There should be a clear difference.

Also unlocking weapons and then having to unlock overclocks is so bad I'm probably not going to play until that is addressed AKA the system removed. I don't want to waste 20 minutes forcing myself to get a weapon to overclock level or praying to RNGesus that I can do at least one weapon in a run. The issue more or less is Legendary +50% DMG to all weapons or common 10% fire rate to shotgun that doesn't even work with fire rate, you have to take the fire rate...
Rather than forcing to grind for overclocks, why didn't you do the same treatment as secondary objectives that you unlock them for all weapons/classes? Hell, make hazard 1 easier and if the player reaches the final stage, unlock them for that class. Make the overclocks themselves a drop like in DRG and make them absolutely nuts. There is no reason to keep things balanced, let people absolutely destroy hazard 6 with cheese if they want to. Just like in vampire survivors.

Currently there are only 3 biomes but i expect more will be added in time, definitely is room on the mission select screen for more mission locations. Hope to see more in the future!

1 major drawback of the game is that there is one class that is entirely unplayable due the nature of it's function. The class requires you to [b]STAND STILL[/b] to deploy turrets. Good luck standing still for more than 0.1 second on that slow character. That needs to be changed entirely. Just make the turrets deploy regardless of movement.

3 schöne Biome die jeder der DRG gespielt hat, sofort wieder erkennt und jeder der neu in das Spiel kommt, wird sich über die Abwechslung freuen. Weitere Biome sind angekündigt und werden das Spielen noch runder machen.
4 Klassen, mit jeweils 3 Spezialisierungen und mehr als 20 Waffen sorgen für mehr als Genug zum freischalten, upgraden und OVERCLOCKEN.
Die Klassen spielen sich sehr unterschiedlich, einziger Wehrmutstropfen für mich, ist aktuell die Tatsache, dass jede Klasse fast jede Waffe erhalten kann, die Türme will ich als Engineer Main aus DRG halt nur bei ihm sehen....andererseits gibt es dadurch noch mehr Möglichkeiten für tolle Builds....daher ""JAMMERN AUF HOHEM NIVEAU""

Im Vergleich zur Demo ist das Spiel nochmal deutlich schwerer geworden, sie wollen das XP farmen auf den unteren Levels schwer machen und daher werden die Bugs nun in Intervallen (nach dem Levelboss Spawn) immer schneller und stärker, bis zu dem Punkt wo ihr überrannt werdet.

Weapons are basic, upgrades even more basic. Would love to see ""overclocks"" having the potential of completely changing the play style of a weapon. It also needs some kind of synergy in between weapons and upgrades.

What i dont like are all the ""non-choice"" choices.
Like getting the choice between a legendary and 2 uncommons. Feels pointless. Sad, that most choices are like this. 

The Character customization also feels pointless. You have to unlock everything step by step, cant really play your favorite build or character because of the damn mission objectives. 

the upgrades for character stats are also pointless, because the most efficient strategy is to spread your ressources evenly, so you get the most stats. Since you are able to unlock every upgrade, no choice matters for the gameplay; everyone ends up with the same stats, there is no ""playstyle"". 
I hope they add more real choices into the game and get rid of forced ""play this"" ""play that"". Especially in a game that is supposed to revolve around strategic choice.
Also. Having players choose between reload speed, damage and fire rate ALL THE TIME is not interesting either. there is always a mathematically superior choice and i wont sit here with my calculator to optimize my damage.

You have to explore alien caves, fight off hordes of bugs, and collect resources to upgrade your weapons and abilities. The game is a single-player, top-down version of the original Deep Rock Galactic, but it retains the charm, humor, and action of its predecessor.

I bought this game at 10% off on Steam, and I have played more than 6 hours so far. I have to say, this game is a blast. It has good learning curves, good graphics, good mechanics, and good weapons. The game is challenging but rewarding, and it never gets boring. There are four classes to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. My favorite class is the Gunner, who can unleash a torrent of bullets from multiple guns. My favorite weapon is the Zhukov NUK17 level 18 overcloks, which has spiral ammo that can shred through enemies.

The game is still in Early Access, but it is already very polished and fun. The developers are constantly updating the game with new features, bug fixes, and improvements. The game also has a lot of references and nods to the original Deep Rock Galactic and its community, which makes it feel like a part of the same universe. The game also has a great soundtrack, voice acting, and sound effects that add to the immersion and atmosphere.

One of the best aspects of the game is the mining mechanic, which allows you to dig through the terrain and create your own paths and strategies. You can also collect different resources and power-ups that can help you survive and upgrade your gear. The game has different biomes that offer different challenges and environments. The Crystalline Caverns are the easiest biome, with no vegetation and useless crystals. The Magma Core is filled with molten lava and exploding plants. The Hollow Bough has vines that can block your way or regenerate over time. You can read more about the biomes in these articles: Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor Biomes Guide, Deep Rock Galactic Survivors Biomes - Full Beginners Guide.

The game also has a larva biome that is not yet available, but it looks very promising. It will feature a dark and slimy environment with larva sacs and acid pools. You can see a preview of the larva biome in this video: Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor Preview - Diving Into a New Genre.

The game has no bugs, everything is smooth. Well, except for the alien bugs, but I slayed them all with my awesome weapons. The game has a good balance between difficulty and fun, and it always keeps you on your toes. You have to be quick and smart to complete the objectives, kill the bosses, and reach the drop pod before it leaves you behind.

If you are a fan of Deep Rock Galactic, or if you like roguelite games in general, I highly recommend you to buy and play Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor. It is a game that will keep you entertained for hours, and make you feel like a badass space dwarf. Rock and stone, alone!",1708339505,1708339505,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Coming from Vampire Survivors it's nice to see some 2020 graphics but that really doesn't matter in the end - good game is good game no matter how it looks. Feels like its running quite smooth even with little older PC (AMD 2600x, 32gb ram and NVIDIA 1070). Update to latest drivers and there shouldn't be any issues.

Had some BSOD- issues at the start but it got fixed after patch and updating NVIDIA-drivers to latest 13.02.24 (version 551.52). Problem was with having too many mobs at once on screen and when I killed them with suicide bombers GPU heat would rise to 90+ degrees and boom BSOD. After update temp stays below 60.

Few annoying things:

1: When u kill the boss char for each level the horde by that time is so big you can only collect a small amount of the bounty and then have to leg it off the level before the timer runs so you get very little for your effort.
2: Voice acting although good gets very samey when playing over and over, i don't mind the grind but hearing the same comments every time i play starting to make me cringe and you can almost predict what they say.
3: Bullet animation for different projectile weapons looks the same and i don't get that YEAH die scum bug that i got from playing the original DRG game.

1. Both Weapon Upgrades and Artifacts lack depth and effectiveness. they're just bland overall.

2. The four characters are a bit too similar, they are mainly differentiated by their weapons and a small buff. For instance, the miner has a 20% mining speed bonus, which seems very insufficient. Increasing it to 50% would justify the ""Miner"" title compared to other characters.

3. Visibility of projectiles isn't the best, especially in darker environments.

4. More bosses, biomes, and weapons are needed, the game currently feels somewhat limited (understandable considering its Early Access status).

5. The permanent upgrades system is too expensive. Adjusting the cost or adding a respec option would help a lot. currently it's definitely more grindy that it needs to be.

I have played DRG since it was in beta, and this game has a totally different feel: I constantly feel very weak.
All the upgrades you buy don't feel to have a significant impact on actually killing the damage spongey-enemies any faster. To me, your guns do not feel satisfying, because they have barely any impact. 
The only reliable way to deal with big groups of enemies is to lure the exploders into self-detonating. Or using the resupply pod to oneshot the boss. When something like this becomes a key strategy, that feels like imbalanced design.

At Haz1, it feels far too damage-spongey. Haz1, in DRG, is the difficulty level where you can fool around not being productive half the time and still be 100% sure you'll complete the mission.

I don't recommend this game in its current state as a polished product, but I will definitely be keeping an eye out until it improves. It has potential, but does not currently fulfil the fantasay autoshooters generally fulfil. 
I am aware it is early access. DRG in Beta was much better balanced than this though, even back when the gunner didn't have his shield yet.

Also, a nitpick: each of the songs used in DRG, actually have a signal function, they indicate a specific phase of the game. It throws me off how in DRG Survivor, the soundtrack of big waves, or for dreadnoughts, or the rush to the escape pod, are played interchangeably and without a reason.",1708334029,1708334029,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's short and engaging but challenging.

You can, however, tell that it is an early access game. 
Below are some things that bug me/should be changed and I think everyone would benefit from these:

1. why is it that after you unlock overclocks in a run you can't use them in that run and need a new run to be able to add overclocks is beyond me...

2. the game offers little to no instruction on how any of the stats/resources/weapons work. As someone who played DRG I think I got things pretty quickly but I can imagine if you have no experience with any of those it can be quite daunting. Especially stats - since each game seems to have their own definition of how crit/status works and so on.

3. weapons that shoot ONLY in a specific direction are bad. They should be made to shoot where the cursor is and it should be a toggle in the menu if you want to auto shoot or click shoot. Because of this. some weapons are barely usable and some are so much better than others. This feels like the kind of thing that should not have been in the game at all...

BONUS:

4. Not adding multiplayer is a big miss given how awesome DRG is because of a multiplayer.

5. They should add an endless arena style run, or king of the hill style, where you can manipulate the map (through mining) to survive as long as you can.

5. More customisation... imagine if they let us use skin packs, at least for dwarves, that we bought in DRG.... It would promote cross play, feel that your investments are worth it, entice people to invest... easy win for everyone.

The upgrades don't really feel like they're worth it or like they make any sort of difference. Leveling up is slow.

There's some places that could do with a bit of improvement.

1. Bosses variation per biome.
When you reach the final level, you don't know which boss you will be fighting and bosses are different for different biomes.
2. Enemy variation per biome.
They're all the same.

3. Better UI explanations. Like what does the white stars that appear on the bottom weapons mean?
What is required to unlock certain stuff?
How much dmg did a weapon do with elemental buff etc.

4. Maybe some sort of passive. It does seem a bit odd that one of Driller's sub loadouts also takes away all of his mine speed. He literally has drills for arms. So it would make sense that he always has faster mine speed to some extent. Maybe with one loadout the amount it can stack is decreased or increased.
Maybe engineers passive is faster reload for turrets. Scout has movement speed etc.

-Only one type of boss that is very easy to learn.

1. It is very grindy
2. Meta game upgrades feel underwhelming
3. Wasting a run unlocking an overclock feels bad
4. Needing to rush to the drop pod after killing boss feels bad because you leave so much xp behind
5. You need to upgrade your weapon 18 times to get the unstable overclock and only then does the weapon 
feel good.

At it's current state this game has uninspired items and achievements, too much fast paced game play, and a boss that's too hard. I think it would be nice if there were achievements that encouraged you to look around and do side-objectives, maybe to unlock each character you need to find them on the first stage of each level and then do their quest like: needing to help Gunner kill a elite bug in the first zone, collecting 3 sentry spots for engineer in the lava area, and finding and giving driller an aquak. I'd like it if you needed to press or hold down a button to call in the drop pod instead of it just arriving instantly, or at least have a lot more time to go into the drop pod. I hate it when I have to drop everything and leave without completing the side objective or having to leave the minerals, I also don't like it when I have to charge through a hoard of bugs just to leave on time. With the bossfight I might sound like I'm just bad at the game but it would be nice if the boss accidentally trampled the other bugs so there's not just a giant swarm of bugs on top of a boss chasing me at once. The boss' jump attack isn't well telegraphed, maybe a red marker to indicate where the attack is going to land, I also hate how the attack is damage in a straight line and not an area around where the boss lands, it just feels like bull when the boss deals a third of your health or worse kills you because it flew over your head. That being said there are some things I like about this game, I like the diversity of the weapons and how they can impact how you play the game, I like being able to bait out explore explosions to make them clear out the other bugs, and I like how you need to do achievements to unlock stuff.

- Weapons basically have no AOE, clearing swarms feel tedious and unfun rather than giving you a sense of power. You are relying on the exploding monsters do deal majority of the damage rather than your own weapons.

- Upgrades feel generic and not impactful. Its just damage, reload speed, crit, firing rate. You are limited to 4 weapons and none of the upgrades are things that morphs your experience from game to game and make each run feel different. There is not much variety in weapon choice or upgrade choice.

- Pacing is too fast, you will often have swarms spawning within 30s of each other and just overwhelm you too soon into the run, made worse by having literally no AOE to clear them.

- Side objectives are too scattered / take too long, made worse with the too fast pacing. Good luck getting 20 Morkite if the 2 clusters that exist decide to spawn on separate corners of the map. You will sit there for 10s mining a single chunk of it while enemies swarm you. 

Right now rather than starting weak and growing to become OP, you start weak and stay weak. The most useful weapon to clear enemies is not your guns but the exploding monsters and the supply drop pod because your weapons have no AOE and no damage.

They need to add more sources of pierce / aoe into the game, stretch out each stage so you arent getting swarms and bosses back to back, increase the density of ores in the map.

At this point I've played 8 or 9 ""VS clones"" or reverse bullet hell games.  This is one of the most unique and innovative of them.  Faster paced and more concentrated gameplay than many of the titles in this genre yet with lots of opportunities to level up and make your build.  Each run consists of 5 quick levels reminiscent of Deep Dives (with breaks in between to spend gold and nitra resources on run specific upgrades).

Visually, audibly and thematically this game absolutely captures a DRG run in VS style (albeit a solo run, complete with Bosco providing a bit of support).  The classes, resources, levels and even upgrade system will be familiar to DRG employees.  Most of the weapons will be too, and although some new weapons appear or operate in a different fashion than expected they nonetheless are very creative translations of DRG weapons into VS.

This is undeniably a good game with many innovative approaches to the genre, but it does still have some flaws that will need further work to make it great.  The game is grindy (all VS clones are), but particularly in the early game the grind is going to turn off some players who come from DRG but aren't that familiar with survivor style gameplay.  I'd definitely like to see faster early game progression as it takes quite a few runs with only one class, one map, and one difficulty unlocked before you start to get into the real flow of the game (it gets better after that though there will always be moments in this type of game where progression gets grindy again).  Hazard levels take forever to unlock and until you do you can easily get bored of playing the same three maps on hazard 1 over and over (even if more maps are coming I'd still like to see this scale better).

While the weapons are pretty well balanced atm (relatively speaking), there will always be disparities between weapons in this type of game but it's important none of them feel completely useless and I've yet to have a run that feels like I lost because I couldn't get a decent weapon (Poor build synergy will always be a thing though).  However the upgrades don't feel particularly well balanced.  More specifically the costs for the various upgrades need balancing, some stats scale well or are more valuable and should be more costly whereas others scale poorly, have low value but cost the same.

My last complaint for the moment and maybe my biggest one is how short the timer at the end of each level is to get to the droppod, you've only got 30 seconds.  Considering you're usually still fighting many bugs and have lots of XP gems and other resources you'd like to pick up it's really not enough time, I've failed many runs by watching the drop pod door close in my face and leave me behind.  I don't mind this as a mechanic over all but it should be more time on the clock to finish things up.

The game might need a slightly lower beginning difficulty, I'm experienced at these types of games but many that come from DRG to here won't be and may give up on the game fast with the current intro difficulty.",1708068794,1708316465,True,1,0,0.504068255424499512,0,True,False,True

Yeah this game sadly has the same problem. Its a really fun game, however getting to know it is terrible. On every stage at the end is an elite bug that you have to kill. At the point it spawns there is a huge swarm of bugs following you, and more keep spawning. The scout - the only class you can play at the start is incapable of focusing on a target. Thats right, you may have a gun, but you cant target what to shoot. You also cant melee. So you aimlessly run away from it and hope by chance your dwarf kills it.

Deep Rock Galactic thought me the value of its traversal tools, ones I would now sacrifice my secondary guns for. DRG Survivor showed me the value in being able to aim, and not in an enjoyable way. If you can get past the scout, there is a really entertaining game attached after. The gunner , the next class you unlock, shoots forward.

You'll see a lot of reviews comparing this to Vampire Survivor, and that's because it is absolutely that kind of game. The biggest difference is the terrain: clusters and walls of rock make the map more elaborate to navigate but what's really fun is that you can DIG through it. This adds a whole new dimension to a Vampire Survivor game. Your split moment decisions aren't just ""do i dodge the enemies this way, or risk it to get that exp?"" anymore, but now include ""do I hole up in here and bunker, do I have time to dig an escape route through here, do I have time to mine this, do I want to leave this wall alone so it continues to block bugs until I use it as an escape route later?"" Really makes it stand out.

The weapons are fantastic and each is unique in an impactful way that makes you adjust your playstyle. You have some that do singular damage, some that do AOE, some that target the closest, some the highest HP, and some only work in certain directions (Minigun is great when you need to get from point A to point B and all bugs in between must DIE, but the Subata is good for covering your back while you mine). The sentry guns are my fave (you can upgrade them with little tank treads!!). The basic upgrades are okay, but the Overclocks are where things get interesting (well, usually. Some of them are more of the same +damage or +reload speed, but I'm betting they're going to add more cool Overclocks later. Game is in early access, at time of writing)

It is grindy though. I've played 32 hours and still haven't unlocked all the weapons. I have mixed feelings about that.

But, I've sunk dozens of hours in because it really is that fun. And I can only picture the game getting better yet as they get feedback from the Early Access period. For a 10$ price tag, value has already been met. Recommended.",1708237056,1708312221,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I really am enjoying my time with this game. Each class has their own starting weapons and passives which do enhance the ways they have to play the game. Scouts are usually able to move super fast, gunners are tanky, engineers can play super passively, and drillers can make mining efficient. There is JUST enough to make each class stand out and each feel fun to play as.

Runs start off slow but they ESCALATE FAST. They consist of five stages; four normal stages and then one where you arrive at a boss level. The boss is extremely tanky, fast, and a challenge to see if your build is strong. It's a solid gameplay loop. Things can feel overwhelming, in a good way. It keeps you focused on the enemy types, your builds, how to plan a route, etc. It has been a very fun time.

HOWEVER...

There is certainly a bit of padding here that feels unnecessary.
I'm not a fan of how you must reach a certain level with a gun in a run before overclocks are available for it. 
Classes and their starting weapons? That makes sense. However, currently, you must get a weapon to a high enough level in one run, and then you can start overclocking in the NEXT one. 

There are also PERMANENT upgrades. Your first few runs will likely result in you dying on the first 1-3 stages due to not having upgrades. I'm not a fan of this system- at least not with how it is implemented currently. It feels like the only real difference between hazard levels is what levels you need to have purchased with the in-game resources you gathered.

It also feels impossible by design to win your first run, even if you are skilled enough for these two reasons alone.

For $10 I still think this is worth a buy, even moreso if they expand on this game. I've already got 10 hours in this game and that's a solid deal for a game that's in early access. Just... be prepared to die, a lot.

1. Stages are too short, and leveling is too slow.  
The enemies are already pretty bullet-spongy at the start, getting momentum in the beginning can be difficult.  Since leveling seems rather slow, it can be very hard to get your weapons powerful enough to feel like you're all that powerful against the bugs unless you get really lucky with some legendary upgrades.  Going for secondary objectives is basically necessary, since the gold and XP you get are essential to upgrading enough to survive, but when you're locked into the same spot on the map because you can't kill fast enough to move, and can't gain ground to collect XP, it becomes nearly impossible sometimes to complete secondaries when they're spread out so far.  Eventually you get your footing if you don't die first, but by that time, the boss is dead, you only have half the secondary objective items, and now you have 30 seconds to fight through a horde that is still probably stronger than you.
I'm not a game designer, so I don't know the nuances of creating game balance, but this can be fixed one of two ways in my opinion.  The first is to make levels longer or give the player the option to really extend the duration somehow, the first stage especially is over so quickly, you're forced to go into the second stage rather underpowered.  The second is to make XP gain faster, letting players become more powerful just a little quicker would be really nice, especially since you can carry 4 weapons, and each has 18 levels to essentially get to its full power, and in my time playing, I've barely been able to get above level 54.  If each overclock came at every 5 levels (5, 10, 15), it would feel a lot more balanced in my opinion.  In games like Vampire Survivors, maxing out your entire loadout IS an option, it takes time and planning, but you're rewarded with a very powerful character in the end.  In this game, you have to choose a single weapon to work on maxing out, as it simply isn't possible to max another when you're overclocking other weapons to make them competitive at all and picking general upgrades so you're more survivable.  I'm not asking that you go into the last stage completely overpowered, but I would like to see it more feasible to be at level 60 or so by the time you come into the final stage, that would give more flexibility in building both your guns and your character, along with the possibility of having 2 guns maxed out or very close to it.  If enemies need to be scaled up in the final stage to compensate, then so be it, but players want to feel powerful by the time they're in the endgame.  What is fun in a Rougelike is feeling very powerful in relation to an enemy who still feels like a threat, when every moment feels like a struggle against them, it's just not very fun.

2.  Meta progression and character leveling is a torturous slog of a grind right now.
Collecting XP, credits, and materials for meta progression is painfully slow, by the time you get to Hazard 3, you basically are soft-locked in progression because upgrading your base stats is extremely expensive in relation to how quickly you get the things to afford it, and when stats are being upgraded by 1-2% after 2 hours of gathering materials to buy the upgrade, it hardly feels satisfying or worth it.  Each class also upgrades very slowly, making new weapon unlocks take multiple full runs between them.  Unlocking overclocks on weapons doesn't feel like too much of an issue in its current state, but getting it to level 12 (and surviving long enough to do it) is kinda tedious.  Base weapons with no overclocks are pretty underwhelming.  Nerfing yourself and dedicating a run to using a weak gun to unlock the overclocks just isn't very fun IMO, but at least you only have to do it once as long as you balance the diminishing returns of leveling the locked gun with actually useful upgrades to your stats and other guns.

Please understand, I REALLY want to recommend this game, at its core, it's still very fun.  I'm being hard on it because I care, and I really want to see the devs turn it into something truly incredible.  Once they work out some of the kinks in the balance, I will be sure to update this to a glowing recommendation, they just gotta get there first.

So I would like to give some genuine praise to this game and refute some of the claims the negative reviews make.

1 ""The game doesn't have much content"": OF COURSE THE GAME DOESN'T HAVE MUCH CONTENT, IT JUST RELEASED INTO EARLY ACCESS.

2 I'm not going to value your opinions if you have only played the game for TWO HOURS

3 ""The upgrades don't feel powerful"": This is the statement I understand the least, have these people even unlocked overclocks? I agree that the normal upgrades feel a bit weak, but they're just meant to be stepping stones to the overclocks. 

4 ""The gameplay doesn't feel satisfying"": I find the gameplay very satisfying. the exploder chain reactions clearing entire swarms, one shotting elites with resupply pods, picking up a magnet and getting six levels at once, I find all of these some of the most satisfying things in any game I've ever played. 

 I think DRG Survivor is a very fun game that does have its flaws, but also has a lot of potential to become something great.

Edit.  Hi everyone. I really didn't expect this to blow up. Thank you for everything, ROCK AND STONE! After reading the replies I feel the need to clarify one of the points I made. The statement I made about needing more than two hours to have an opinion was not my best: when I wrote that part I was angry that people were saying bad things about a game and franchise that I like. However, I still think there is some truth in that statement: two hours is more than enough for a first impression, and it's fine to write a review about a first impression, I just don't agree with people writing extensive reviews of the entire game based solely on other people's reviews and a first impression.

It has all the same sass and humor as the OG game but with a nicer Art style (IMO)

It's a shame, but I wouldn't recommend DRG: Survivor as of yet to anyone who isn't a fan of the main game.
I played Vampire Survivors, Brotato, Death Must Die, and Halls of Torment, and I'd recommend each of those games in a heartbeat. DRG: S is not there (yet). If you've played all of those games already and need a new fix, DRG: S could be for you for at least a couple of hours.

While it captures the look and feel of the original Deep Rock Galactic, Survivor lacks in variety, and every run feels more or less the same. In each stage, you'll mine for gold, nitra, and other resources, fighting off huge waves of bugs while waiting for a special Elite Bug to spawn. If you manage to kill it, it's off to the next stage. The classes offer little to no diversity besides the starting weapon and some minor bonuses which can be compensated for after one or two level-ups in a run, turning the class distinctions obsolete in the blink of an eye.

But I guess there is still room for improvement. Adding new types of enemies from the main game, for example. Also, the main menu could use an overhaul. I would like to see a bar, a dancefloor, stuff like that where I'd equip cosmetics I found in a run. Oh yeah, cosmetics! They aren't in this game. DRG has a ton of things you can find during a mission, so I'd say it's part of the charm. And this feature is missing in DRG: S.

Well, I hope things get better in the next couple of months. Do it!
Do it for Karl!

Don't want to read whole sentences? Here's the tl;dr:

pros: 
 
- captures the look/feeling of Deep Rock Galactic pretty well 
- graphics are neat 
- mining/destructible walls are a fun mechanic 
- great sound design and OST

cons: 

- classes don't feel distinct 
- small enemy roster 
- no cosmetic upgrades for the dwarfs 
- no hub -> no bar -> no beer

When I played the demo, I remember the game to have some sense of progression as it was getting easier with upgrades, until I was hitting a wall of difficult swarms at the very last level available in the demo. 

I bought the game and played it for 2 hours, with no sense of progression at all. I clear level 1, sometimes 2, by regardless of how many times I buy upgrades, it's the same animations, the same delay before killing the same enemies, I get all the damage upgrades I can find and it still take the same number of hits to kill the same ennemies????? The fire rate doesn't look like it is going any faster either, the reload time doesn't feel like it is going any quicker, the mining time doesn't feel like it is going any quicker, my character doesn't feel like it is going any faster... It feels like the upgrades are doing nothing.  

No matter how many times I die, buy permanent ""upgrades"", the game doesn't change, my character and his weapons do not feel any different, the only change is that the swarms which seem to get more numerous and the enemies tougher earlier in levels 1 and 2. I unlock the 2nd character and the engineer and I don't feel any more powerful.  

I would ask for a refund if I could :( [/strike]

-Some ""social"" aspects, like community stats, challenges, objectives
-A ""bar"" themed lobby where players can spend minerals to buy beers with special buffs for the next run, like in DRG

-Increase the magnet drop rate (I rarely even get one per run, let alone per stage)
-More/longer stages (you need very good RNG to get some enjoyable OP builds, and by the time you get there, the run is almost over)
-More enemy diversity

- Having to choose between powerups(weapon upgrades X status upgrades) gave a good twist in the game since you cant spend too much of your upgrades in the status ones that will give you specific element damage, crit chance/damage, mining speed because youll be a jack of all trades but master of none. 
- The weapon specific updates are amazing, and combined with class-specific weapons make the gameplay a lot fun
- Having to choose between a weapon specific upgrade that is rare for example, and a status upgrade that is epic or legendary makes this game really fun
- Having to deal with mining, completing the level mission, dealing with mobs adds another layer of complexity on this type of game
- Having to also choose between mining ores that are used only on the current run(nitra and gold) or going straight for the ores that give you permanent stats updates is also a nice gameplay mechanic.

I'm not recommending it, even though I know the devs could turn this game into something great if they give it even a tenth of the love and dedication they have given DRG. I want to believe in the it, though, and I'll amend this review based on future updates.

Currently, DRG:S feels like a half-finished mobile or browser-based game. This is a game about mining ore and shooting bugs, and all you do is run into rocks to mine them while shooting at the same time without pressing any buttons. The gameplay is fairly bland.  Enemy AI is extremely basic, and this goes especially for the final boss of the dive. In order to beat the game you shouldn't necessarily level your weapons, but mainly your mining and movement speed, so you can kite the boss around forever. Everything else is secondary. Differences between various elite enemies are also minimal.

Another weird part for me is the loadout system. The fact that I still get Scout weapon upgrades when I'm on a Gunner run, for example, takes away some of the uniqueness the classes have in DRG. And even the class ""bonuses"" lose their edge after a few levels.

I will say that DRG:S looks nice and despite its flaws, it's a nice way to waste some time and decompress after a long day. 

TL;DR: As much as I love DRG, and as excited as I was for this game to come out, DRG:S feels more like a mobile game with the same assets and voice lines as the original. Your mileage may vary, buy at your own risk.",1708304225,1708304323,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

 Many of the systems seem to throw you to and fro. Collect, but don't collect too much or the waves will get too strong because of a hidden timer. Call down a drop pod so you can get strong items, but if it lands on the elite you need to kill you've got 30 seconds to gtfo or you lose. 
So collect, but not too much. At the higher levels you are actively punished for having a strong build as the level elite will die fast and you cannot get as many resources, leading to a lack of upgrades, allowing the difficulty curve to overtake you.  (One could argue this is the design. One could also argue using a spiked bat for pleasure is a good time.) I don't feel like I am throwing hands with hordes. I feel like a phantom usher is shoving me from level to level and spitting on me when I try to deviate.
Some of the weapons need buffs, and bad. It isn't that you cant break away from the difficulty curve, its just some weapons you start with kneecap you before both they and the usher spit on you again. 
Last big erk, secondary objectives should give nitra too. Simple as. 
As soon as they fix the flow of this game it will be PRIME. I think increasing most of the ""you lose, idiot"" timers should help and a few buffs will do the body good. Keep an eye on it, and keep your mind open to it.",1708303560,1708303560,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Ive seen quite a few reviews saying the classes and weapons lack variety and depth but I disagree. Each class Has a different starter ability as well as a very unique set of weapons. I do agree the abilities to set each class apart are fairly bland and do not add much. In some cases you can just earn up to it within the run. For example the scout only starts with 10% extra movement speed and +20 health. 

You can easily earn this mid run. What sets each class apart are the weapon types. For example the driller has several different Flame and acid type weapons while the driller starts with Mini turrets that you will have to strategically place in the right place by standing where you would like. 

You can unlock and overclock for them later on to allow them to dynamically follow you around.   

As of now the game definitely does lack content as it only has 3 biomes and one game mode. It could use an endless mode as right when you start to feel strong you kill the boss and the run ends. I would also like more boss variety, Possibly making the boss random each time you reach the end of a run to create a sense of suspense. 

as well as different bosses the higher you reach in hazard level. 

On a final note it may just be a skill issue on my part but past hazard level 3 I find almost impossible and I think could use some tuning. Overall For $10 even if this game was never to receive an update again, id still recommend it.",1708303446,1708303446,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Two classes are outright bad (looking at you, Driller and Engineer) with frustratingly little kill power, even deep into a run.  I've only had 1 or 2 builds that have ever really ""popped"" in any way, like in normal VS-style games, and even then there wasn't any real satisfaction when it happened.  I think most VS-like players would agree this is a pretty big issue that needs some attention.  VS and its ilk are so highly lauded because there's normally a""WHOA!"" moment when you pick up a combo of abilities that synergize together and give you that feeling that you no longer fear the enemies, instead they're regretting the coding that forces them to approach YOU.  

To be quick-ish, It needs more variety in the level-up AND overarching perks you buy with minerals.  Some of the overclocks are interesting and insta-grabs, but most are meh.  I really like the weapon selection, but the class/loadout perks are pretty meager as well.  I would also like another mission type or two to bring it more inline with DRG and mix it up a little, though I like the biome variation and how the biomes beyond the first have their own environmental hazards.  

End of the day, this is an EA and needs some more work under the hood before I switch my review to positive.

The only two things that stop me from absolutely playing this non-stop are lack of multiplayer and variety of boss stages. The game [b]just[/b] came out, so I'm going to hold out hope that both of these are added in the future, but even as is, the graphics, gameplay loop, and mechanics are all extremely fun. It's worth trying out all the different classes and you'll find that the ones you might not enjoy at first, will feel much better later after you get some more upgrades and try them again. 

For me, the gunner felt a bit weak starting off compared to scout, but after upgrades and unlocking some overclocks (the bullet penetration on minigun....dayum), he just becomes a machine of death.

While building up your stuff though, I would recommend the engineer. The constructs put out great damage and status effects can help keep you safe in the early game.

The driller's base passive is really great for farming ore (go figure) and although the weapon he starts with is pretty crap, you can overclock it to give your other weapons a massive boost (I like a mix of constructs and projectiles for consistent damage).

I think the best part of this game is learning how to use the terrain to your advantage. The enemy AI will always try to go around if there isn't a direct way to you, so you can drill straight into a wall and leave a sliver left to the outside and setup a bottleneck, then if things get dicey you're pulling the swarm to your front so you can always escape out the back in an instant. 

Overall, really fun game. I really hope they add multiplayer in the future for the longevity of the game, maybe some events and stuff. It really depends on how far the devs want to take it, but I could see this game potentially being around for a long time if they wanted to do the work.

The game is far too difficult and fast paced to be fun. You always feel weak and even with upgrades the mobs continue to easily outpace you. Even 12 hours in, all 3 waves of enemies in a level will be alive at once because I can't kill even the first wave before the second and third arrive. Unlike vampire survivors where most weapons and combinations make you stronger, in this game the options that actually make you strong are very rare and not intuitive. If you just build for fun, you will almost always be so weak you can't even finish a level. 

The game also bizarrely does not give you enough time to do all the things it tasks you with. If you farm nitra and gold, you miss out on experience and levels and upgrades. If you do secondary missions, you miss out on both of the aforementioned. If you kill enemies and collect their exp to get strong, you miss out on nitra and gold and secondary missions. Every path you take feels bad because you are missing out on ways to progress. On top of that, you have to fail runs to unlock overclocks for weapons. Weapons are not viable without overclocks yet the game asks you to throw away sometimes multiple runs praying for rng to give you the weapon you want to unlock OCs for and then praying it gives you the upgrades to get it to lvl 12. I still have not been able to unlock them for multiple weapons despite actively trying to. 

It also feels very bad to not be able to get experience for killing enemies. You have to manually pick it up, but the map is so covered in bugs that most of the experience is completely lost and huge amounts of power and progression will just stay on the level until you lose it all by being forced to move to the next one.

Game is early access.  It is not complete.  Don't purchase and complain that there isn't enough content...  There is more coming.  

Costs less than a trip to the movies with snacks, and I've already gotten more enjoyable playtime than the run length of a movie.  Worth it's price in my book.

I have not noticed any bugs in available content.

Plays similar to Vampire Survivors, but with added Rock & Stone.

Progression is too slow and the longer you play the more it becomes boring. This game is not much different then Vampire Survivor. Vampire Survivor has a near perfect progression and keeps the player engaged the entire time. They do this by giving you access to many different combinations of characters, items and stat increases. The randomness decreases in VS as you play given how many re-rolls and passes you get. This game's progression is hindered by only having 4 characters and a set amount of weapons that each character can use (thus locking you out of some given what character you play). This makes the progression much slower and duller as you are forced to use characters and weapon combos you may not like. This happens in VS, but not nearly as much. You have to grind each of the 4 characters in game for a long time to unlock all their weapons and profiles (this is the main complaint, make this faster, it's so dumb how many replays you go through). I've played 21hrs and  don't really feel like I've unlocked anything really cool or fun to keep me hooked playing. I did not expect this to be a 40hr+ game and I don't really think it should be. If the devs want the game to last 40hrs+, add more characters, profiles, weapons, have a game mode+ or dlc. I like my vampire survivor clones because they are fast and addicting. This is long and drawn out for no real reason. Plus, god give us multiple bosses, one is not enough and so boring, strategy becomes stale given the repetition.",1708294581,1708294581,False,3,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

I think Vampire Survivors on steroids is an understatement. 
Basic idea is the same, you walk around, your character auto shoots enemies. 
But...
There are a few really cool mechanics, kinda new for this genre, like procedurally generated environment. You can dig out resourced that you will use in this run, but also different ones that are spent for permanent upgrades. 
You can destroy rocks to escape yourself from swarms but also help yourself out to fight enemies in corridors instead of open area. 
A looot of items, weapons, what is already surprising for a game which is still in Early Access.
Unique level up system, which allows you to upgrade weapons in different ways each run. 
Rogue-lite + ""vampire survivors""-like game, definitely worth a try.

[h3] The Good [/h3]
There's a lot that this game does well, weapons + classes feel unique and interesting, feedback for enemies and pickups is satisfying, hit-boxes are fair and the unique aspect of the dives from DRG combined with mine-able terrain/collectables and explode-able enemies that you can manually detonate makes this game stand out design wise from it's other survivor like counterparts.

[h3] Needs Work [/h3]
I'm a huge fan of the design and progression of DRG, so there was a lot of that I was hoping to see in this game, mainly:
[list]
[*] Interesting map generation and sub objectives - DRG has a wide variety of sub objectives and natural cave features that make every run unique and engaging, even with the 3 map types the levels in this game feel very repetitive and uninteresting.
[*] Satisfying progression for weapons and characters: the stat increases you get feel very unsatisfying and don't really customise how you play. Overlocks are fun but you basically get them all for free once you've played + levelled with a weapon once. There's definitely a lot of room for improvement here.
[*] Better bosses + elites: I'd rather than have a action packed fight with lots of dodging than a tanky turtle that crawls towards me and occasionally leaps at me.
[*] Weapon slot design: Currently at hazard 3 I find myself prioritising overclocks for sheer power, which means I often have 2 guns severely under levelled and basically just there more for aesthetics than use. This might be less of a problem on higher hazards I'm not sure.
[*] Cosmetics: not really a must have but I'd love it if they brought some unlockable cosmetics from DRG here.

Unlocking Overclocks for weapons is by far the worst offender, whenever you discover a weapon you have to max it out in a run once before you see what fun things it can even do in a second run, if you even see it again. Basically whenever you discover a new weapon you have to dedicate time to having an unfun run to make it out. 
The upgrades are also way too strong and take way to long to get. 
It feels like they are trying to pad the run time of this game out, like its a 10 dollar game, let us get all the upgrades sooner than later so the real fun part of the game can start.

You do eventually unlock some more interesting options (like increasing your damage by 1% for every 5 gold you have), but I'd like to see more cool upgrades available earlier. The progression path for weapons is also a little annoying - i.e., you need to level weapons to 12 in order to unlock their overclocks, but you can't use them until subsequent matches, so the initial levelling of said weapon is just a pointless grind.

Many people complain about the lack of aiming, but it is actually a specific design choice, since different weapons have different aiming strategy or shooting pattern. And this adds a layer of strategy in your gun choice.

Another common complain regards the need to level up a weapon in a run before having access to its overclocks, but also this mechanic to me its fine. Make it necessary for you to first do a couple of runs with a weapon and learn how to use it, before giving you access to more advanced options. It makes sense in terms of lore, in terms of gameplay, and it feels rewarding.

I think we all had high expectations for this, and to me, it just doesn't live up to many of them.

Seems like mostly fan service unless they make major improvement.  
- Severe lack of content. 3 maps doesn't cut it at this stage in these games.  Playing just to unlock harder versions is not fun.  Where's the secret objectives and other events to open other areas and other ways to play?
- Most of the weapons within the same class don't really feel much different.  IE Gunner.  OK great, I got a new weapon.  It mostly feels like there's just another stream of bullets in there.
- Same thing happens on every mission with nothing to discover.  Sames bosses.  Same hordes.  Barely any addition of new enemies.  
- Side missions with collecting are pointless. Yes, ok, you get some gold and such.  That's it.  These should flow into some other improvement aspect of the game.  Also they shouldn't have a limit.  Right now, for example, you have to collect 6 flowers, but there's a bunch more you could get.  Just make it a sliding reward based on how many you can get.  
- Add more achievements. LOTS more achievements.  And make many of them skill based feats, not ""Collect 2000 gold"".  It's fine to have these, but give us ones to actually strive for.
- Needs more relics.  More effects that drastically change how you play that run.  There's just not enough here. 
- Unique events or other triggerable things to do?  Again, we want more variety, more things to consider, more options to squish bugs, and more builds to play with.  
- Other game modes please?  Like a non-timed map? Something?

The main things that I think the game feels ""off"":
1. The classes - Unlike in the main game, this is not (up to) 4 player co-op, this is just a single player experience. Much like in DRG, each class has their niches. However, being single player only does highlight the power imbalance between classes.

The classes do play the same (in terms of the core gameplay) as there are no mobility tools like the zipline or grappling hook in the main DRG game, instead the game introduces subclasses with different starting weapons and a unique perk. However, in my opinion, some are just better than the others.

Since the mining mechanic is useful for making your own path through the terrain on top of getting your gold and nitra (which you need to buy upgrades and/or heal between stages, as well as rerolling), you want to prioritize mining minerals in the early game as it gives exp. As driller has innate mining speed increased, his early game seems much easier, as well as doing ""throwaway runs"" just to get minerals like jadiz, umanite, enor pearls, etc.

The classes also share some weapons with each other so the only thing separating them are the subclasses' unique buffs and slightly different stats (e,g, scout has more crit dmg, gunner more health, driller more mining speed and engineer has increased xp gain.)

2. The weapons - The variety is nice, a lot of returning weapons from DRG as well as some new ones introduced in this game. HOWEVER, unlocking the overlocks of the weapons require you to take the weapon to lvl 12 in a run first, and then you can get overclocks on subsequent runs at lvl 6,12,18 (18 being an unstable overclock which are gamechangers). This is not a good design choice imo as it basically forces you to do a few sacrifice runs just to unlock the overclocks for each weapon. In my many hours of playtime, I would say 10 levels per stages is the average, but when you level up, you also get other important upgrades, such as CRIT rate and dmg, health mining and movement speed, pickup range, etc. You also get additional weapons at lvl 5,15 and 25. So getting lvl ups for the weapon you want is inconsistent. (If they would just make it so you can get the overclocks on a weapon without spending a run unlocking it, a big part of this issue could be solved......... I do understand that this may be the developer's choice to get the player used to the weapon before giving them free reign but 12 lvls is just abit too high in my opinion)

Basically you rarely get the chance to get more than 1 weapon to lvl 18 to feel the power for long, because usually by that time you will be at the last stage. Perhaps the early access version's scaling is a bit harder than in the demo but that might just be a placebo as I have 100% the demo but not done so yet for the early access.

Overall, the gameplay loop is fun but shallow, considering other ""survivor-like"" games allow you to have a proper build by the end and enjoy the power fantasy, DRG survivors seems like they want to preserve the feel of DRG more than leaning more into the survivor like gameplay. I look forward to more enemy variety and if the developers would take more creative liberties and try more new ideas as it seems the association with the main DRG game is a detriment rather than enhancing the gameplay. I believe this game achieves what it sets out to do but could definitely use more content and polish to make this game truely stand on its own.

I would give this game neutral if possible but after playing it a bit more, I would say it leans more towards recommend than not.",1708215641,1708284752,True,0,0,0.500593900680541992,0,True,False,True

Vampire-Survivor like in the Deep Rock Galactic Universe. Crossover is really well done. Although mission variety isnt the same and could be improved. This is a 9/10 in the category.

The Good:
* Visually the game is amazing, great environments and great animations. I really like to see a Survivor-Type game made with budget. I wish you could see the different weapons shooting from your character though.
* Music is good, sound is great, voicelines make the game feel more alive.
* The walls and the mining add another layer of complexity which is very welcome.
* Nice enemy density. Its always fun to have to deal with a big horde of enemies.
* The different missions with different maps and different difficulties are great and would keep me engaged BUT:

The Bad:
* The worst part is by far the upgrade/level-up system. All upgrades, and I mean every single one, are basically just minor stat increases in a very blant way. Builds basically don't exist. You just take whatever increases your damage-output the most at this moment. Just take a short look at Brotato and its item variety. This is not just a problem in this game, this shit is especially common in Triple-A games these days, where upgrades are just like +10% damage. Booooring.
* Even more limiting is that upgrades have a rarity on them, so mostly they take away the freedom of choosing an upgrade because you usually want the upgrade with higher rarity that give you that tiny bit more damage. In the shop its fine since higher tier upgrades cost more gold, so theres a trade-off, but the level-up reward screen is an illusion of choice.
* Overclocks could have helped with creating interesting builds but most overlocks are also pretty bland, rarely game changing. And having to unlock overclocks first is just annoying. Theres better ways of doing meta progression than wasting runs for unlocks.
* I could be wrong on that but It also feels like your build doesn't even matter because killing big hordes of enemies mostly revolves about creating chain reactions with exploders...
* The permanent upgrades that you buy with the meta currency are just boring stat boosters too.

The game has alot of potential, and I hope the devs make the best out of this early access.",1708279889,1708283901,False,3,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,True

This is a very addicting game! The bosses are the hardest part so far but i think that you can defeat them in time! I can't wait for more updates to come!

 - red vines wall on 3rd level feels too much, sometimes blocking huge part of the level. i was blocked like this from drop pod by the swarm and this walls, hp was kinda low so i couldn't go thru the swarm and had to try walk around the vines, guess what happens... i couldn't make it in time to drop pod. also drop pod time feels too short, with all the troubles and obstacles you have to go through. maybe it will become easy once i get all the passives but not right now...

 - feeling disappointed now with some of the weapons, like Warthog or CRSPR, how do devs want you to aim normally with WASD having a small by default radius in Warthog or how to do damage with thin CRSPR beam lines moving around, like in HAZARD 3 when you also have to mine minerals and get as much more xp from killed enemies... i'm talking about the start with this weapons at least, i can understand they might be cool or even OP at lvl 20+ but you need to get there first which much easier to do with rifles, machineguns... hell, even Subata is pretty cool compared to this two i mentioned. CRSPR in my opinion should fire in move direction with beam going from one side of the radius to another, Warthog should aim automatically, or make it possible to aim with the mouse.",1707933064,1708279561,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The weapons are all too similar, upgrades and overclocks are just small stat increases. There are virtually no movement mechanics. 
There are no synergies of items to leverage for interesting builds. Weapons have huge reload times yet the time-to-kill is long even when your weapons are up.

The game ramps enemies in count and strength faster than you can level, so you mostly don't get to fully explore many of the levels. 

Short of grinding out base stat upgrades for dozens of hours, you have no chance to snowball. Maybe the higher Haz levels will provide an xp/difficulty ramp that makes them actually more fun to play, but no way I am going to put in another 20-30 hours of grinding to find out.

Right now in this form, it's a huge disappointment and probably the least fun of any entry in this genre I've tried. Hope the devs see the feedback and do something to build out some fun.",1708279257,1708279257,False,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

There's so much more going on in the environment than other survivors games but it all fits together cohesively. There are mission objectives, resources to mine, supply drops and of course the ever-present horde of bugs. You can focus more on mining or more on killing bugs and it's fun to switch between the two. The weapon builds and overclocks are great and require you to focus on upgrading certain weapons over others. 

The bug horde is meant to be a constant threat that has to be managed, this is where deep-rock-galactic-survivor departs from other survivors games. The bug horde path-finds to the player based on what is presently on the screen, this allows you to funnel the bugs through chokepoints and plan escape routes when they get too close. It's a really interesting and sort of unexpected aspect of this game that I really like. Some people are put off by the fact that you can't just click your mouse and destroy everything on the screen, but it's really important that the game is designed this way so that the mining mechanic works with the combat, and it's what sets this game apart.

A glaring issue right now is the fact that there is a single boss fight at the end of each Biome and it's exactly the same. Not sure the developers were thinking here. There is a good amount of content and polish in this game already, so why not at the very least have an alternate boss model with different attack pattern? The game also is in need of more ""supply-drop"" power-ups (these are passive buffs that can change your build) because right now there are only about a dozen and you end up getting the same ones over and over again.

This is coming from someone whose never played vampire survivors, but after playing this i am heavily considering picking that title instead of this one.

The gameplay seems to gotten worse, i am not sure what kind of feedback the developers recieved and actually cared enough to look at from the demo release, but i swear they've made enemies be bullet sponges as opposed to being able to kill them.

The upgrade system is still unchanged from the demo, still a joke. Upgrades don't feel like actual ""Upgrades"", you can't even feel your firepower improving with them. I am not sure why the devs thought a ""3% fire rate"" on all weapons is a good and noticeable ""upgrade""

The main ""Dwarf Upgrades"" are also a joke, 2% fire rate, really now? What a joke of a system.

I know this is still a ""Early access"" game, but at this point the ""Early Access"" title for me goes more and more into the ""Oh hey, we have a heavily unfinished game! Please give us 10 dollars to play it!"".

Please, for now i highly wouldn't recommend this game, i'll personally see how it improved after a year, or when it comes out of EA, just pick up vampire survivors if you want something remotely more fun than this mess.

Positives: sooooo fun! shooting and watching bugs blow up is just as fun as DRG if not more so!  Excellent arrange of weapons to choose from between the different classes and sub-classes!  Graphics are top-notch and i haven't had any crazy graphical issues/clipping that messed with gameplay at all. The random spawn of levels is awesome as well. This is by far the best $10 game you could buy!

Negatives: Really none, i cant find anything that completely turns me off from the game or is so annoying id call it a negative.

Suggestions: i do have a list of things that are geared towards new players and maybe you guys are implementing some stuff since it is pre-release.
1. A short tutorial - maybe a 3 level with an elite at the end? i knew what things like nitra/gold did, the different minerals (ebony pearl, jadiz etc.) were for because i played DRG, but i have seen others who ignore all of it because they didn't know they were for buying upgrades between rounds or for the permanent upgrades. Also explaining that getting a weapon to level 12 unlocks the overclocks that are essentially to progress.. i actually didn't know that until i was about 2-3 hours in and ""accidentally"" unlocked one.
2. Maybe adding in that when you hover your cursor over the different class/sub classes it could tell you how to unlock them.  It took me a bit of looking through the menu's to figure it out.
3. Different end boss types!
4. More biomes! DRG has like 10 =P
5. Longer mission time.. it does seem like sometimes each level is just a bit too fast.
6. The only graphical issue i have had and it was pretty rare was sometimes the Dreadnaught would hit me and it i really felt like i was not in the hit box/radius to be hit by him jumping.  Maybe i suck at dodging! but sometimes it felt a little inconsistent.
EDIT: I'm not sure if its a bug or not but sometimes when i get hit while im mining my character slows down.. like he loses all run speed bonus and is noticeably slower. its caused me to die to the dreadnought as well as almost miss leaving a level a few times.  Seems to happen about once a run, but if it happens on say level 2 the ""debuff"" disappears when you start level 3.

All in all excellent game id highly recommend and would give a 7.8/10 for now!",1708178398,1708269889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I see people comparing to other, similar ones, and while it shares a lot with those other ones, being in the same genre, after 8hrs of play, here's my observation:

It's fun.  Weapon choices matter.  Powerup choices matter as well.  Time matters quite a lot.
Wrong weapon choices can end your run at the last level, or any of the earlier bosses.

Like in the OG DRG game, the bugs spawn in ever increasing waves.  So it's a good idea to clear a level rather quickly, BUT you want to get that tasty gold, and nitra to power up between levels.  Powering up between levels can be critical as well.

The mechanics are kind of similar to Yet Another Zombie Survivors, where you need to balance the weapons of the other teammate.

Here you'll be balancing area effect, environmental, mining speed, etc.

The unique thing here, is that 90% of the time, you'll be weaker than the bug horde.  Even if you end up squashing a wave, if you take too much time, eventually the next wave will overwhelm you as the bugs get stronger and stronger.

This is where it's important to have some weapons that can damage bosses fast.   I've had runs where I've only had forward facing weapons, and just couldn't do enough damage to the boss since I'm always running from it.

A bit of strategy is called for, and different dwarves have slightly different loudouts that do affect gameplay.

Not having them evolve mid game seems like poor design decision that I hope they remedy before release. It's unfun having to level a gun to max level on base mechanics, especially since with the limited game time I don't even expect to max 2 weapons on most characters(The XP Engineer being the outlier). 

The game itself is quite fun with the destructible terrain, collectible goals, and the cheesing with the drop pod. That last part did however make the game terribly easy from what I've played so far. I think it not being a co-op game is odd considering the base this spinoff comes from but at the same time I can see the difficulty in trying to balance a Survivor game with multiple players. 

With some polish and revisiting core mechanics of the game I totally see this being flipped to a thumbs up but for now I'm bored of it within a few hours and leveling guns to ACTUALLY level guns is not my cup of tea. Oh, and it would probably make the game far too easy but allowing mouse targeting on the ""In front of Character"" weapons would feel so much nicer. I hate mining when I've got the shotgun/railgun, I just ignore that aspect of the game til I get a second weapon(And I don't focus on leveling them because they feel so clunky).",1708263096,1708263096,False,1,1,0.387114226818084717,0,True,False,True

The ability to dig through walls and create your own path while collecting some valuables in said walls. Other games may have little/no incentive to move around despite moving being the only active thing you do in these games. Vampire Survivors? Yeah let me go pick up that Empty Tome upgrade by holding left for 5 mins, I'll get there eventually. DRG: Survivors? Ooo, piece of candy... Ooo piece of candy... Ooo piece of candy.

Use that to either prevent them from getting too close until you're ready to create an opening or even use their own digging to help you mine the gold you need for the next upgrade/reroll.

I will, however, point out the glaring flaw with this game has over other similar games. No ""unique"" synergies at all. VS has weapon fusions, 20 Minutes 'til Dawn has upgrade paths, nothing but stats in this game that [i]maybe[/i] affect more than one weapon that you have. Major upgrades (overclocks) only come every 6 levels and can sometimes be something special like adding elemental damage, or maybe it's just a stat boost for that weapon alone... Not as much variety in this game as others.

For those looking for meta-progression I might recommend a different game though. Based on the number of ""Milestones"" as this game calls them (the unlockables between sessions) I bet you easily run out of them before ever reaching the highest difficulty. There are still upgrades that act as permanent stat boosts which look like they may take longer to fill out though so maybe that's a consolation for you.

- the only notable thing about classes is the weapons they get access to. No other unique mechanics, all the stat bonuses they start out with can be overcome with one level-up reward;
- overclock unlocking is clearly meant only to pad out content by forcing you to do runs again and again before you can actually make use of overclocks;
- only some of the overclock options are game changers but most are simple stat bonuses that can be overshadowed by one level-up reward;
- weapons need balancing, there are some mandatory picks and some that are never worth bringing;
- there are game-changing artefacts but the loot table is crowded out by boring stat-boosters;
- enemy variety is low: mostly melees, some spitters, one exploder
- the permanent upgrades are all boring yet mandatory stat-bonuses, there's no choice to be had here, you are expected to grab all of them, which is made super-slow to pad out the lack of content.
- the end-boss has one trick: it jumps on top of you. So all runs oblige you to stack speed and to always clear a path along which you can do laps, no matter what you class/weapons are. There's no other strategy to this fight.
- in general, there's only one meta-strategy and that's to clump up the enemies and trigger a chain explosion. While fun, there are exploders at every wave of every level on every map so even that gets boring.

The consequence of all the above is that, for now, the runs are identical. The only reason to do them is to unlock the few interesting overclocks.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[h3]+ Core game play plays extremely well[/h3] creates an addicting game play loop, currently each run has 5 stages that are on a timer till the boss spawns once the boss spawns the bugs will occasionally be buffed until the boss is defeated 
[h3]+ Graphics / art style are great [/h3] this is the first auto shooter i have seen in 3d over 2d
[h3]+ Mining[/h3] lets you escape the alien horde when cornered but also forces you to make a choice to fight or mine for resources for upgrades

[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[h3]- Content [/h3] very few variations in aliens, maps, artifacts, this will probably be fixed in the future since the game just came out but its important to note at this time
[h3]- tank controls [/h3] for weapons that are directional it can be difficult angling your weapon to shoot the horde coming towards you, 
[h3]- milestones [/h3] milestones currently mix the completed milestones with the incomplete ones making it harder to track what you have left to do. this isnt a huge issues right now but could become a problem when the game has more content


overall the game is great and i look forward to future updates

I really liked the visuals, your character and operators' voicelines, and especially exploding bugs which you can trick into destroying the whole horde following you.

But, while I've been having a moderately fun experience with the game, it was gradually ruined by balance and technical issues:
1.  You have to upgrade each weapon to a lvl 12 to unlock its' overclocking. I can't imagine going into vampire survivors and collecting each weapon to a certain lvl so that the game would let me evolve this weapon in the NEXT run. The game loop   turns into this: unlock new weapon - start next run on the lowest difficulty - hope that new weapon will appear in your weapon selection on lvl 5 - 15 - 25 - click on every upgrade for this weapon until it's lvl 12 - repeat for every weapon you find in the game.
2. Right now there's not much to do in terms of sidequests. You've got to collect/mine 6 to 20 things every round and find an airdrop when you reach the middle of each round. That's all. Oh, and kill the big bug  at the end of the round.
3. The most disappointing thing that made me write this review: I've lost my savefile after power outage. I've played two sessions and everything was erased. It wasn't that much playtime, about 3.5 hours, but because of the first point I don't want to restart my progression cause it's so tedious.

I think it takes a bit too long to gather all your weapons & effects, and rounds end too fast to enjoy the power for long.
I also think that having every run split into 5 stages doesn't work that well, since for 3 of these stages you're often just weak & they all start somewhat slow. There's room for some changes, and additions to other simple game modes: more mining/less mining, stages/survival.

Having played the game, I can definitely say the meta progression is terribly slow. I also think the criticism some others have said about explosive bugs being THE way to do damage is correct. 

All this being said, the core game loop is enjoyable. I can see the design choice was meant to mimic the FEEL of Deep Rock and it definitely does that. The relentless tide chases you from point A to B as you desperately try to mine resources before they catch up to you. Nailed it. However, I think the devs leaned in on this a little too hard. It never feels like any choice  makes a significant difference. This is the essence of the genre. You have to feel like the decisions you make affect the game play. Otherwise, the game play feels way to shallow to warrant your time. There is definitely a great addition to the survivor genre here. I just hope the devs can see the difference between nail biting challenge and nihilistic tedium.

The game play is mainly running around gathering materials, doing objectives and running AWAY from hordes of enemies, so imagine my confusion when they decided to make certain weapons ONLY shoot in front of you or behind you.... This is stupid and honestly should be changed to at least fire towards the cursor/mouse.

Things I would like to see changed:
1. 30 Second window to leave makes it so much more rushed for legitimately zero reason, I've lost several runs because it throws the pod in some insane location and while there is still a horde chasing me, sometimes the horde is also ON the drop ship, which results in a loss because you literally cannot enter the ship due to the enemies damaging you and killing you, sometimes it spawns the ship SO DAMN FAR its not possible to get there without movement speed increases, on floor 1.
2. Weapons only firing in set directions. Not single one of these weapons do I like using, I don't like the Minigun, the Warthog or the Subata. I don't like any of them, they all feel significantly worse to use than any of the automatic aim weapons. (If it was cursor based they would actually be useful in comparison to the auto aim weapons.) 
3. The amount of environmental hazards gets actually completely ridiculous the moment you go to the Magma Core, it goes from ZERO hazards to THREE DIFFERENT ONES. Which aren't too bad one at a time, but having them on Floor 1 is just annoying, especially since the Stabber Vines shouldn't/can't be in the Magma Core.

It borrows a lot from Deep Rock Galactic and converts it neatly into a Vampire Survivors style game. The visuals are great and match the same attractive look of Deep Rock which is beautifully paired with many of DRG's awesome soundtracks. I haven't encountered any bugs so far and the customization is varied and suits both budget and high-end machines.
The game play is, of course, what this game is about and it follows a 5 stage dive format with the mission types being limited at the moment (with more on the way among other things). You start by leaving the drop pod to mine (yes, mining is a very important part of the game play loop similar to DRG) and kill Glyphids to level up and collect upgrades for your dwarf and arsenal. As the mission progresses, swarms will attack, a supply pod will arrive to give you an artifact, and an elite must be killed to trigger the escape pod. This is repeated for stages 1 through 4 then the final stage you face a Dreadnaught to achieve victory. Mix in randomly generated areas to explore, 4 classes to play, 3 biomes to weather, and a truckload of things to unlock or upgrade, and you will begin losing track of the time.

When you hit a wave, wave spawn bigger bugs and exploder bugs.  Making those exploder bugs detonate kills other bugs in the wave making huge jumps in the progress bar, therefore leaving you less time to mine and do maybe some other mini events.
Its just not fun as you can spawn 3 waves and kill them in less than a minute if you really want it.

4. Painful but addictive.

Cons:
1. Having to use dry runs to obtain overclocks.
2. Mini-gun forward-facing requirement; you'll rarely be fast enough to shoot the Dreadnought for any meaningful amount of time.
3. The amount of time given to reach the drop pod after the stage boss is killed; without movement speed bonuses and/or a clear path, you can be shut out of completing the stage.

It's actually a problem with the genre as a whole that has unmitigated powercreep the more you play making gameplay duller instead of making the game more challenging the more you play. Wish someone actually did something about that. Ease a player into the mechanics and then apply difficulty as they gain upgrades and unlock new stuff.

This is the typical unbalanced experience we see in the genre that's excused by being ""hardcore"" when in reality the devs just haven't paid adequate attention to the balancing of the initial 10 hours of the game at all and made it unneccessarily hostile to the player.

Now for bigger review. there is a lot to like and dislike about this game. 
i would also like to give some feedback and ideas to devs who may read this.

i believe the biggest problem the game have is that it looks like DRG, it plays similar enough to DRG and yet it lack it distinguishing features. It is its biggest strength but also its biggest weakness.

[h2] Characters [h2]
You have beautiful formula for making distinct characters, why did you not use it here?
You can basically collect experience from 2 sources, combat and objectives[ores, collectables].
so why does every character play the same, why are they not on sliding scale between these 2 progressions?

Why doesn't scout have grapple hook, allowing him to quickly navigate map and collect resources?
Why does driller mine only as fast as the other dwarfs? Or give him melee drill attack. Or make some walls unpassable that only driller can mine.
Why not give a gunner his shield, which would also fix his inability to shoot back with gatling gun?
And what about engineer? why does ho not have ability to build walls, for example? you give him static turrets that would benefit from terrain control.
There is a formula in DRG where every character is distinct and plays differently, and yet its lack in this game is all the more grating. 

[h2] Level design [h2]
I will be honest, the caves are just boring. And i don't mean distinct biomes, that is nice idea and i would like to see more of them in the future. But the algorithm that generates the caves could use some work to make them more interesting, Right now, they are just rectangle with some holes here and there but that's it.
Also why don't we have a map? looking for dropped magnet is a pain and as they are rather rare, it feels bad to pick them up at the start of the level and to abandon them if you are unable or don't have time to find them at the end. 

[h2] Gameplay [h2]
Now this one is hard to judge. i like the concept, i like how difficult it feels but right now. Yet i also feel like there is no chance at victory and that sucks. Even at hazard 2 with good half of the meta-progression, i have problem killing the juggernaut. the problem is not the big bug, i would kill it with time, problem is that i drown under all the adds and there is nothing i can do.
The game would also benefit from more secondary missions and final stages.

Also some aspect are very questionable. 
Like the guns that only shoot forwards in a game where you need to run away from bugs? And you cant shoot anything when you decide to mine? i would understand if we could selectively choose to aim like in other game, but without it, it add a lot of difficulty just hitting something you need to hit.
Or the uncleanness of some aspect. how is the experience and gold determined? do i gain more on higher hazard?
Also the horde mechanic feels redundant. you are already attacked by horde, now there is more? so what do i do? if i am strong, i will just shoot them anyway, if i am weak, i will just run anyway. at later stages, i could not tell you if the horde is happening or not. it should feel more distinct, yet with the current balancing, it does not.

Pros: 
- many viable builds, at least at difficulty 1 to 3 (havent played higher difficulties yet)
- classes and subclasses offer different playstyles
- weapon modifications (overclocks) can really change the fundamentals of a weapon, offering unique advantages and combos
- levels feel really different with unique map features. Not just visual

Cons: 
- My game crashes from time to time (although I haven't found many others reporting this)

1. You HAVE to rely on swarm exploders to clear out the swarm. Your weapons do not deal enough damage/do not have AOE. Because of this you never feel like the upgrades you receive do anything.
2. There is not enough time during a stage to complete side quests/mine minerals for character progression. Swarms occur too fast and once you kill the boss, you have to rush to the pod. Also if you do finish side quests/mine minerals, you end up grinding a few hours just to get +1% crit chance or +1% move speed as your character progression... 
3. There is no proper class distinction. Upgrades are the same for most weapons. Similar weapons are offered to most classes, until hours into the game when you finally begin to unlock some more. As of now, I never paid attention if I was playing as an engineer or a driller, because they are all very similar. 
4. Randomly generated maps add a lot of bad RNG into the game. On some maps, you can get a ton of resources and a nice layout. On some maps, you will run around only encountering boolo caps before actually finding some resources...but you're already half way through the stage and there are 3 swarms...

Both leave me wishing I got interesting upgrades instead. Some of the weapons, especially the shotgun is very frustrating to use on MnK. The different specializations and miners don't feel different, you get a different passives, between stat adjustments or minor effects, like having your weapons start off closer to their first overclock (ie real upgrade). I should also add that most of the real changing upgrades are locked behind the very last overclock slot for a weapon, so you're more likely to get an overclock that is relatively simple for the majority of the run.

There are many complaints about the conflicting fact that you both need to mine materials while also being almost pushed out of the level, AND on top of that you also need to put your time into farming for XP, at the start I also felt like this was a weakness. However; the more I played, nearly 16 hours in, I realize that there is a good balance between all of the priorities. After some time, which the 2 hour reviewers have not gotten to, is after getting more upgrades, and ESPECIALLY overclocks, Im able to split all of the priorities evenly throughout the run.

This here is another gripe many have, not feeling strong enough. Again, the start of the game is meant to be difficult, if you have very little play time, you have very little progress on your account. I feel like im overpowered now at this point.

Content is lacking slightly but of COURSE it is, this is an early access game as of right now. I have run into zero bugs, and no gameplay is clunky which is the normal now not only for early access games but many triple A games.

If you like DRG either way, you will love it because it stays close to the original game with characters, weapons, voice lines, bugs, etc..

and I will start by saying that this game is great!

It has the Deep Rock charm you know and love but with a ""Survivors"" twist. As it stands right now it has enough content to justify the price tag. I feel some others are judging it too harshly and while they aren't wrong in some aspects the game can still improve over time from updates and more content drops. Each class actually has quite the unique set of play-styles if you build right and tinker with specific setups. The Mining aspect of the game is a nice little bonus to acquire materials and take advantage of traversing the map. The enemy variety becomes more difficult to manage on higher hazard modes which is nice over just a health and damage increase. Lastly, the weapons/upgrades and grinding for overclocks does actually feel pretty rewarding and allows you to tackle the higher difficulties just like in the main deep rock game. Overall, it pretty much is a fresh take on Deep Rock and if you do like the survivor genre it is a worthy game to give a try, you won't be disappointed! 


Now,
if the developers are reading this, I have a suggestion for the class system to make them even more unique and mimic  mechanics/abilities that Deep Rock Galactic has.
- Give the Scout a grapple that can be used to cross gaps and allows for a nice escape tool!
- This is an odd one given a zip-line would just be like a worse version of grapple so...I think the Gunner should have a tag/mark system that rewards for focusing specific enemies and allows Bosco to unload artillery on targeted enemy.
- Give the Engineer a platform tool that allows for blocking pathways and pushing bugs to specific pathways.
- Give the Driller a drill overpower mode that when active allows you to not take damage from the front and do quick burst/mine damage for a short amount of time.

All of these of course would be either limited use or on long cooldowns to balance out the amazing advantages they would give you.

I want to love this game but beyond the mining and destructible environment (which is very satisfying and a cool mechanic), the gameplay is just so boring. There is SO MUCH POTENTIAL here that is not being used and it's just a little sad. Play Brotato instead. Much more variety and replayability there
Pros
- Mining is a fun and unique mecahnic
- Can play with one hand while still being engaging
- Visuals and sound are great
Cons
- Guns feel very uninspired. I haven't unlocked ALL of them, but 11 hours and about 15 victories in, they're just kinda boring
- Meta Progression is slow and boring. Yay another 2% damage increase or 4% pickup radius...
- Overclocks are underwhelming and the fact that you usually have to waste a run to even get them is ridiculous. Like, 25% more damage and reload speed? That's like two levels worth of upgrades and you get about 40+ levels per run or more. 
- Artifacts are the only thing so far that seem to actually affect the way you play your run in a meaningful way. And even then, there's only a few that do that. And you can't reroll them either for some reason
- You NEVER feel overpowered. In a rogue-lite, that's the most satisfying thing, finding a fun combo that makes you feel strong. That doesn't happen here. The  most satisfying and powerful way of clearing enemies is when an exploding enemy makes a chain reaction with other exploding enemies. Why can't YOUR BUILD do that instead of it being in every wave by default, making whatever build  you chose kind of meaningless? 
- Characters do not feel very different. The driller for instance starts with +20% mining speed. You can get that from ONE upgrade. All the characters are just a few upgrades away from each other. Sucblasses are sometimes unique but rarely affect the way you play.

Some things I would like to see:
- More unique weapons or weapon synergies
- Better upgrades. Small stat increases are just boring if that's all there is. What about On-Crit modifiers or element combinations, different mining bonuses other than just speed and resources
- Make the characters more unique
- I hate the overclocking unlock mechanic. Just change it or make the overclocks available on the run you level the weapon
- MORE INTERESTING OVERCLOCKS. With a few exceptions, they are bland and boring and don't change the way you play at all. 
- Just less boring please! The core idea is fun and unique enough to give this life",1707988125,1708232888,True,1,0,0.515706777572631836,0,True,False,True

But I will list my reason why I am giving it a no below:

With the mining aspect it gives the VS-like genre a new USP. If a swarm becomes too much you can simply dig yourself a tunnel to escape. Other than that you will also find ore to buy upgrades between layers.
However, due to having to mine for upgrades and level up myself by defeating enemies I am constantly torn between ""should I go boom boom enemies"" or ""should I rock and stone"". 
When you first load into the game you can already see which upgrades you can potentially buy after each game. For me this simply meant that if I collect minerals during the game I can then use them in that screen. I did not expect the minerals to be essential during each run itself as well, so I didn't mine any in my first.
Another aspect which feels wonky are the upgrades themselves. Besides that they are very basic now (eg. ""do 10% more damage with this weapon) which I don't mind much it is hard to tell how impactful they are. Other than go for the rare or epic upgrade I don't see a reason to go for other upgrades besides damage, mining speed and reload speed.
Last but not least the weapon upgrade milestones you can unlock. I really like the idea of choosing upgrades for specific weapons which then can unlock special milestones on them depending on how many upgrades that weapon has. What I am missing is an overview which upgrades I already chose so I can better choose which milestone I want.
In general am I missing numbers in this game, I want to know how which upgrade affects which weapon or myself in what way. Currently it's missing that bit of structure for me.

For an early access game it nailed the basics of what an VS-like is, and I'll gladly update this review when it gets polished some more. :)

--------------The Issues----------------

First of all - getting in the drop pod within 30 seconds OR DEATH is just about the worst gaming mechanic I have ever seen. You beat the boss? That's too bad, if you can't run through the horde of enemies without dying you die anyways! There's no increased difficulty to the drop pod, it's merely death.

The weapons? Remember when you played BTD5 and every tower was useless at the beginning besides the one you used? This game has the same problematic trope, but there is no paywall to justify it. 

The upgrades? Imagine creating a game this far after vampire survivors, with so little customization. No duo powers, those are even in mobile games! There's crit, damage, attack speed, reload time, and duration. That's it!

Even if you haven't played Deep Rock Galactic (what are you doing, go play it) this game is quite polished and addicting. The game is a solo auto-shooter roguelike (ala Vampire Survivors) built beautifully in the world of DRG. Complete challenges during your runs, and mine minerals to receive permanent upgrades that will help you survive further in your following runs.

My only slight complaint is that there don't seem to be many (if any) unique voice lines to this game. They are copy-and-pasted from DRG, which isn't a big deal but you'd think they could record some new ones since this is a completely separate game. I've heard that the game isn't very long at the moment, but it was just released in EA and the time it takes you to complete all available levels will vary. I just completed my first dive after 3.5 hours, so I still have a long way to go, which seems like plenty of playtime for a $10 game.

TL;DR: If you like the auto-shooter subgenre of roguelikes (like Vampire Survivors), this is a great game to play. Even if you haven't played Deep Rock Galactic. But seriously, go play that as well.

Great production values. Destructable terrain makes every run a little different and creates some fun tactical options. The end-level timer rush also creates a fun bit of mad-dash to complete the level.

The core gameplay loop has good tension. You have to balance the opportunity to mine (upgrades) or kill (XP).

CONS

The meta of this game is pure linear stats grind. As soon as you level up enough to clear Tier 1, starting Tier 2 is like starting the game all over. You are back at the bottom, dying quickly, and just grinding tiny little stat increases to eventually get stronger. First time through this was fine, second time through its all the same, you just suck again, on the same levels. Hamster wheel stuff.

Weapon and equipment / skill synergies are almost non-existent. There should be way more benefits to certain combos of weapons and other augments to make builds interesting. Brotato and VampSurv did this really well.

4 main characters classes, with 3 subclasses. But the sub-classes just have tiny stats differences and starting weapon but it doesn't add much to the strategy because your build is a matter of random chance. 

It would definitely help if the game let you control your builds during a run. At the very least ""bespoke build"" mode should be an option and give the player control if they want it.

Game also needs more flashy fun stuff and wacky effects during a level clear. Like Vamp Survivors had disco gold mode, crazy light shows, temporary insanity triggers, etc. Things like that would make the runs more varied and fun.

VERDICT

Worth about 10 hours of play time at this point. Expanded meta, build control, weapon synergies, and more glitzy random events during levels would make this game an ace.",1708222745,1708224657,False,0,0,0.472440958023071289,0,True,False,True

Would love to see some more biomes, and for them to have more going on than simply being increasingly difficult to navigate, which on that note, Hollow Bough should probably go back to the drawing board.

I haven't played long enough yet to unlock too terribly much, but the weapon upgrades all seem to be... more or less identical. Reload speed, fire rate, damage. Seems to be the case for just about everything, and I feel like there needs to be some more uniqueness to them so that they have more of their own identities - much like they do in the original DRG. Overclocks definitely need some more creative ideas as well, as most of them seem to just be a couple of weapon upgrades packaged together, which isn't very interesting or even impactful.

My tip for anyone playing is to stay on the first hazard level of the biomes until you unlock the weapons for overclocks.  And then also get some of your powerups moved up as well.   

Another big tip is watch your mini map.  It shows your minerals and mission objective collectibles.

As a quick overview for the game currently (2/17/24)

The game in itself is a survival based title with some roguelike elements for your playthroughs.

There is meta progression as well for the game to work on as you go along for those that may want to know that.

Overall a run is comprised of picking a character ( 4 currently; you start with just the one unlocked ). Every character has a starting theme or loadout; with more you can unlock over time as you go along. The starting weapon and class traits with said loadout can add some variation to your runs.

When starting your dropped into a Biome ( Map ) to begin your run. In the map your surrounded by randomly generated rock layouts and enemy spawn points. You can break the rocks by moving into them with varying levels of time needed to break some ( resource based ones take longer ). Within the map you will have rocks that grant resources for your run to use on upgrades or resources that are used after for your meta progression upgrades.
The goal on the maps are generally to kill monsters until the final Elite appears to kill and you can complete that floor to move on to the next. Each run has 5 Floors to do to fully complete the map your on.

More difficulty levels exist as you make progression towards map goals that are shown when viewing the biome you wish to complete or play on. The goals always include completing the map and 2 set goals often tied to collecting a resource or using a certain type of gun.

There is a varity of ways to increase your strength while doing your runs. You have weapon upgrades & relics you can earn on each floor of a map if you want to go for it ( involves clearing a set marker on the map and holding the position for like 5 seconds or so? ). One facet of the weapons is unique upgrades called overclocks but are not unlocked by default. Once unlocking a new weapon; the game will require you to level it up fully in a run to unlock the overclock ability. ( Note- is currently not a feature players care for right now as it seem like double dipping to use a weapon fully ).

Between floors you will get a shop to spend your resources on for upgrades and you do have re-rolls by default by using in game gold during your runs.

As for the meta progression at the title screen; you are able to sell un-needed or wanted resources or buy wanted ones for cash ( meta progressions are tied to cash you get from runs and the resources tied to various upgrades )

Overall the game is enjoyable but will say it is challenging from the jump ( nice for some..annoying for others ). Given this is more of a survival game..its not inheriently intended to be played as a traditional Roguelike to farm a map for exp and resource as enemies will outpace you in most instances. The enemies get stronger at the end of floors infinately until you beat the Elite for that floor. So for those maybe wanting a power fantasy of wiping a map with overwhelming strength..you may be a bit dissapointed. 
All in all its a fun title and does need some balancing and tweaking to things and it should turn out well as the foundation is definately there.

Personal notes..the only real issues ive noticed performance wise is bad stuttering when the screen gets heavy enemy wise ( I run a 3080TI for reference sake and a higher end CPU ). Also one bug thats only happened once where the map failed to load properly but seems rare at best and simply re-started the run.",1708220346,1708220346,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Compared to other Vampire Survivor-likes, most of the time you can do nothing else but run around like a bitch. There is almost never a moment where you can stand back against the horde, just run run run. You never feel powerful.

All weapons, with some exceptions of the primary weapon of the first class specs, hit like a wet noodle, and even investing significant effort into upgrading them does nothing. ""Overclocks"" are underwhelming most of the time, with some exceptions. A lot of the artifacts/gear from supply crates is not very impactful, although then there are some pieces unlocked later that are good. You either get them, or you will struggle (and probably die early into the run). 

Nonexistent level design so far. 3 biomes, they change a bit, but you always do the same. 5 stages, with the same boss in the last stage. Every single stage is the same. You run around for a minute gathering resources, after that ""a sWaRm Is cOmiNg"" and you run away from it for the rest of the stage, trying to clear the supply crate area and stand still long enough so it drops down. Variety of enemies is also nonexistent. 5 models of bugs get old really quickly, compared to hundreds of different enemies in Vampire Survivors. Sure, in there a lot of them are just stock images from bought assets, but the main issue is seeing lack of any progress. Brown bug, red bug, blue bug, big angry flying bug with a health bar, shit shit shit, run!

There is too little information. You don't know exactly what element types do, you just guess it from gameplay, but the exact mechanics remain hidden. How is the damage for each element calculated? How much damage is from the initial hit and how much from the DoT? The weapon details don't tell. If I upgrade damage of a fire weapon, does the bonus translate to higher fire dot? Plasma type is really just a single bounce from the wall? Weak and pointless. Nobody knows. I don't want to go scour a wiki for this, put the information into the game.
HP bar is only on the toughest enemies, so you have no idea how well you are doing. They either die, or don't, and they form impenetrable wall you have to run away from. Highest weapon damage seems to be on the weirdest places. You are telling me this stupid fire grenade I didn't upgrade at all scored regularly millions of damage, while the gun I upgraded from the start did barely a million? Weird.

Mining is only fun to a point when in higher hazard levels the horde is on your ass and you wish the game rolled you a legendary Mining Speed upgrade or two. Then it's just frustrating.

Rock and stone? More like ""sweat and frustration"". I will give it a year before trying again, right now I regret my purchase.",1708219969,1708219969,False,76,2,0.619125485420227051,0,True,False,True

You can overclock weapons, but doing so requires them to be upgraded to level 12 in one run, which would be fine, but beating a level requires an incredibly strong build, which requires overclocks - which means you'll need minimum one run to level a weapon to level 12 (and that's if you get lucky enough to get upgrades for it, which aren't guaranteed by the looks of it), and only in the [i] next [/i] run will those overclocks be able to be used - this means a guaranteed forced one death minimum on the first stage to the final boss, because you just won't have enough DPS to get through otherwise. 

Speaking of the bosses... well, the first level's boss has two attacks, which is one more than many other enemies. All enemies will move towards the player to hit them - classic Survivors gameplay - and some will do other things like blow up or spit slow moving projectiles. The first level's boss has two attacks consisting of moving towards the player at alarming speeds, or to jump in their direction. The issue(s) with this is that this jump goes incredibly far, tracks the player to a high degree, and the boss deals a significant amount of damage to the player, often in the ball park of 4~ hits to kill a scout, the first playable character (who you are forced to make your first few runs with). You can dodge these jumps fairly consistently if your play field is open, which... it is not. Your play field is full of hundreds of enemies walking at you, and walls that need to be mined away. They are mined slowly unless you take the mining speed upgrades, which leave less for damage upgrades, which means you can kill the hordes slower... it's a vicious loop made difficult to navigate by poor balancing. The mining is an innovation on the genre fit for the Deep Rock name, but it also adds an entirely new dimension (hah) to the balance that leaves players floundering for necessary upgrades. You simply never feel strong, and the game never reaches the highs that Vampire Survivors does for its celebration of killing thousands of enemies with ease. 

Did you have to die in Vampire Survivors? Sure, eventually, to the literal personification of death, but that just acted as a level timer - and even then you could kill death if you built well enough - but the final enemies here are just... bigger bugs. Completing a run in Vampire Survivors also counted when you were killed, because for most players, that would be their end. In Deep Rock Galactic Survivor, if you cannot kill the final boss, you've failed a run and your pity prize is the scant few upgrade crystals you've collected along the way. This key difference leads to a massive disparity in run quality between Deep Rock, and Vampire. In the latter, you lead a string of victories to grow stronger and better, unlocking new items and beating new and exciting enemies. In the former, you're scrabbling for whatever chance you can to try and last as long as possible to try and gather enough materials that the next run might matter a little more.

I suppose it's more faithful to the ""Survivor"" part of the title, but it's not why a lot of us play the genre. In its current state, the game is fun and well made, but ultimately frustrating and poorly balanced. As someone who has sunk countless hours into both Deep Rock Galactic (on ps4) and Vampire Survivors (on switch), this doesn't capture the wanton slaughter of either, and feels like an attempt to make a very hard game without an understanding of why it's being made. I can't recommend it until a thorough balance patch takes place.",1708219007,1708219007,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

I wasn't convinced on the purchase from the comments and game footage, but after purchasing I've been pleasantly surprised.

It really comes down to tuning.  The power progression curve feels quite good.  You start of weak, but you rarely get to a point that you feel disgustingly overpowered.  You do feel an increase in power though, and with the randomness of upgrades you can have quite a bit of variety in bad to good runs.

The additional mechanic of mining is great.  I think this leans in to what this game is offering that it does better than any other one I've played so far:  It provides multiple objectives for you to choose between, and there is a depth of skill in how you use your weapons and upgrades to make a run more efficient.

As other reviewers have noted, the fact that you don't really get to the point of blowing up the whole screen while afking can be a drawback for some people.  For me I think that you have to pay attention the whole time makes it a more engaging game.

these games tend to get pretty stale after the fourty-nine thousand six hundred and seventy-fifth instalment, with only a handful worthy of being called 'exceptions'. This one, at least for me, is one of them.

Just like its older sibling [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic] Deep Rock Galactic[/url], the gameplay revolves around the mining mechanic, namely the destructible walls. e.g. Do you choose to dig straight through the wall, giving you an extra emergency exit; do you leave it intact, making it harder for enemies to reach you, but forcing you to take a longer route with potentially new dangers; or do you try the risky route that leads to that [i]very profitable-looking [b]vein of gold[/b][/i] that ends in the corner of the map, with the only way out being a massive cave wall? [i](Always remember, Kids: [u]when mining, some of your weapons may not function and your movement is significantly slowed down[/u]!)[/i]

In my opinion, the game requires you to make more decisions that can have a lasting effect on the course of the round than other representatives of this genre, in which it mostly comes down to a simple [i]""do I still have enough HP to continue firing away or should I run away and heal"".[/i]

Felt like commenting to lighten the mood because I am not quite sure where the negative comments are coming from.

This game does what most rogue-likes do and adds a couple mining elements to give you a little something extra to do.
Ignore the negative reviews, the game isn't impossible or poorly balanced or FAR too boring, its just very key to focus on a weapon to get the ""overclock"" abilities and those are what make the game fun which you may not get them quickly into the game as you need to focus on a weapon till you upgraded it 12 times so then your NEXT run you get access to the overclock abilities. I have had plenty of success so far and some really fun runs.

Now not all weapons are made equal obviously but using the right passive with the right weapons is crucial. Each miner has 3 passive starting abilities/stat load outs and you have enough weapons that have their couple different overclock options, minimum 6+ per weapon. Some might overlap as far as buffs but I haven't experienced it yet. As some do focus on powering the weapons strengths OR making its weaknesses not as bad so you can find a build one way or another. I understand where people are coming from saying the weapons aren't VERY innovative but i mean its sticking with its theme quite well and has plenty to keep you interested. You have your turret builds, your elemental builds, your high rate of fire builds, ur low rate of fire high damage builds, gernade/throwables builds, and all sorts of things inbetween. And changing the elements of the weapons highly effects the way they interact with the enviroment its NOT just a ""scales with elemental modifiers"" perk. 
 I would pay double the price they are asking for this game and still be happy. So its a very fair price. 

Different maps with various map hazards
4 miners with sub classes
plenty of guns and passives and an interesting progression that requires you to gather certain ores which is an interesting take on the long term progression

overall solid game worth the price.
I wouldn't think about it twice as far as buying it goes.
If this is a game they plan on updating more it can only get better :)

This game, considering its in very early access, is really solid and a real blast. So many different weapons and combinations alongside the choices of 4 characters who each have up to 3 different builds they can use, gives the game a lot of variety and build choice. All weapons (even if at first they seem bad) can become godlike and disgusting combinations can be made.

The game also has some unique features as well as those we've seen many times before in the Roguelite genre, such as a near fully destructible terrain + mining for currency which allows for a very different playstyle compared to the usual dodging mechanic formula from a lot of other games. 

Features I would like to see added to flesh out the game a bit more...
- An endless mode sometimes you just have that great, fun build going and the game is over all too soon.
- A boss rush mode for that true adrenaline rush.
- More weapons, overclocks, love what they have, would love even more to mess around with.
- More unique boss enemies, currently only one.
- More permanent upgrades as well as higher difficulties to counterbalance them (such as +1 base gold/nitra from mining would be really fun to take builds even further).
- Just more fun. Game is great and roguelites for me are all about just kicking back for a bit and having nothing but fun absolutely blasting through massive hordes of enemies and chasing those epic and legendary powers.

Again, considering this is early access, I can currently and confidently say that the only way is up for this game at the moment and I myself am eagerly awaiting future content updates and to see where the development of this game goes, highly recommend giving it a try.

Vampire survivors, Holocure and Death Must Die fulfil your power fantasy. This game does not. You feel weak at any stage in the game. Maxing out only 1, maybe 2 weapon out of 4 feels really bad. Some overclocks (weapon modifiers that you earn by upgrading weapon) are really, really underwhelming from game perspective. 
Way too hard in the mid game. You feel like you're banging head to the wall. Unlocks are slow at that point and bugs are way too powerful. 
It also doesnt have an endless mode so thats a bit minus. 
Doesnt have ingame glossary or any way to view a weapon you unlocked(with stats). How am I supposed to know what difference between Acid damage or Fire? How am I supposed to know exactly how dots are applied?
Splitters are way too powerful, they spawn like crazy, have crazy fire rate, they are relativly tough and more importantly they do more damage per hit than a god damn exploder. Who tested that?

It kept freezing and with no error code i am not sure what to do. But even if this ran perfectly i still am very disappointed as someone who really liked the demo. Seems they lost the feeling somewhere when balancing things. Difficulty is the main things i can tell is different, but movement speed, gun damage, and mining speed i would swear were reduced. 

I remember Hazard 1 and maybe even 2 being pretty easy, but enjoyable once you got a feel for the game. But in this final version Hazard 1 was hard for me as I am not a highly skilled player. There is no I-frame or anything like that when you get hit you get hit a lot. You are dealing with swarms so when taking any damage its easy to be taken out while still at half health as you will be hit by many attacks each dealing 5-10% damage. I found i often got cornered with no chance of success. bugs on all sides my guns barley doing anything to them and no ability to try and run through and eat some damage, as running through more than 6 bugs is fatal. The time to get to the drop pod is also way to short. Its not really possible to run through the enemies so it took me often 15-20 seconds to find a path the the pod when i was ready for the boss to die. If the boss died while i was just trying to survive. That got much harder to make. I don't know why you cannot get a little breather when you have so many other things in the mission to do, at least in Hazard 1 it would be nice to get a time bonus. 

This game make a mistake i don't think the main DRG makes in that it locks all but one class behind achievement unlocks. You no longer can try all 4 classes out to find what you think feels best for you. Now you have to start with the one class available till you have completed for me what was several runs. Then you will only unlock one more class. I hate when games do this. Its fine locking some stuff behind progress unlocks, but not everything. If a game has a lot of play-style options let me taste the variety before i sink a bunch of time into it. The main game does this really well i think. You get a try each main play style while still having the variants of that play style locked. 

I started a return. If i cannot get it to run long enough to play then that is easy decision, but even before that became clear i was seriously frustrated playing this game.",1708214553,1708214553,False,2,0,0.52141803503036499,0,True,False,True

The gameplay will be largely familiar if you've played other horde survival auto shooters: you run around the map with a huge number of enemies bee-lining for you. Kills generate XP which you use to get upgrades. The enemies get harder as you upgrade, so it's an arm's race.

What does make this game unique is the DRG universe tie-in. So basically, each run of this game is modelled on a DRG deep dive. For one thing, this means that in addition to killing enemies, there are also resources to mine or collect. You also have destructable terrain, which is very important tactically, as you can create ""tunnels"" that will force enemies to funnel on one side of you, allowing certain weapons to be far more effective.

Upgrades are boring. Unlock system for overclocks is a chore. Just like in DRG, magma core is annoyingly dark except this time there's no flare gun. Watching someone mine from afar isn't satisfying, only makes me wanna touch the minerals myself. Some of the game mechanics like facing enemies with gunner to fire with the minigun, that may be creative but it wasn't rewarding enough to be fun...
Honestly, there's so many other negative things that come to mind that I'd rather stop here. I'll keep an eye on the updates but as it is, I did not have fun with the game.

I recommend adding this to your wishlist and checking on it every now and then. As time goes on, I think it has potential to get better but it's not worth buying right now.

* Always be mining, especially gold and nitra. 

* When you unlock the secondary mission objectives, go straight for them at the beginning of each mission since they become harder to complete later on. They reward tons of experience and gold.

* Loot bugs have gold and nitra and are faster to mine too.

* Gold and nitra are used to buy things between missions, but gold is also used to reroll items both in the mission and intermission.

* Unlock your overclock upgrades ASAP. To do this, focus all upgrades into a weapon and nothing else until the bar is fully unlocked. You can then simply die and repeat the process for other weapons.

* If you're cornered, remember: You've a pickaxe. Mine through it!

* On map 5, save the supply drop for the big motherbugger. It'll cleave half its health bar right off.

I do like that mining an mobility play a larger role here than they do in Vampire Survivors. And just like anybody else who played the original DRG game, I like dwarfs, snarky comments and killing Glyphids.

But unfortunately, there is also a number of major issues here:
1) Currently, you cannot do a lot with the terrain in terms of creating a tactical advantage (like carving out a more easily defensible zone) - feels like wasted potential
2) The four levels in each biome create a weird interruption in the flow.
3) Upgrades don't really feel all that meaningful, it's mostly a few percent more here and there
4) I would expect that your build becomes more powerful throughout each run, so that in the last third or quarter, you mow through normal enemies without effort (which is IMO one of the main things that makes Vampire Survivors so compelling)

All in all, especially for a more casual player like myself, the game is currently not that much fun.

However, I think it doesn’t take it far enough in some aspects, and the game suffers from some blandness. I do have hopes some of this will be ironed out as the game is in early access and came out just a few days ago, but other things are core design decisions the devs probably won’t walk back on.

The positives:

Adding a destructible environment was a great decision and it sets apart this game from every other in the genre. The environment can be used to funnel enemies and carve out paths to make your grand escape in those ball tickling moments the auto shooter genre is known for. It can also block your path and force you to plan your escape ahead of time. It’s just good.

Borrowing the minerals from the base game and using them as a way to get more upgrades in the run and permanent progression is a great way to add something for the player to do during downtime. Walking across halfway the map for an item in Vampire Survivors wasn’t the worst, but it certainly wasn’t very fun either.

The ability to use drop pods and exploders to kill bosses and large groups of enemies is both faithful to the original game and is just fun to do.

The deep dive system is a further compliment to the mining system making sure there is always stuff to mine, and serves as a reset of pace to make sure you don’t get utterly overwhelmed by enemies even if your build isn’t amazing. Although having to rush to the drop pod every time isn’t so great, sometimes I have an OP build and want to destroy everything in my screen.

The new weapons and some overclock ideas are really nice and hopefully get added to the base game.

The overclock system itself is a nice alternative to the more prevalent evolution system in this genre, but whereas some overclocks are nice others are quite lame, and it seems like there is a lack of many overclocks in general.

The 4 different classes in the game are represented quite well, but I really don’t like a certain design decision that I will get into now.

The negatives:

Your weapons are (mostly) limited to your class. This stifles build variety and kills experimentation, and what’s worse is how contradictory weapons and their classes can be. The driller is encouraged to dig tunnels to funnel enemies, yet lots of his weapons like the sludge pump, the flamethrower and the wave cooker are bad in closed spaces and better in open ones. On the other hand, scout’s mobility encourages him to stay in the open, yet lots of his weapons like the m1 garand, gk rifle and double barrel encourage him to stay in tunnels and funnel enemies. These weapons being restricted only makes sense in the base game which has completely different gameplay and therefore completely different gameplay balancing.

Like Halls of Torment, 95% of your upgrades are just generic stat increases. It becomes tiring taking the same upgrades again and again. Some weapons have unique upgrades like the additional beams and split beams, but it’s very rare and only for a few weapons. All weapons taking the same upgrades also leads to a lot of the weapons feeling very similar too, some weapon specific upgrades like additional pellets for shotguns, +x penetration for more penetration focused weapons etc. would be nice.

Runs are too short. Even though the deep dive mechanic is great, by the time you actually get OP the run ends. Having an endless mode with an extra 5-10 more minutes to go ham at the final stage would be great.

There is also no option to aim manually, but some weapons are balanced around this mechanic so it’s not as simple as adding that option like in Holocure or Halls of Torment. But it’s not fun running away from enemies as the gunner fully knowing you’re missing out on a lot of DPS but would die otherwise, or your double barrel shots targeting some small singular enemy rather than the huge wave in front of you.

I have some other nitpicks but overall I do think this game is good, however I would recommend people to play Holocure, Vampire Survivors and maybe Brotato first, as those games are simply better made with more content and imo more fun.

I’m sure more content will be added in the game like new enemies (macteras that actually circle around you and shoot stuff, opressors that can dig stuff/damage you with ground slams etc.) and new tools, but some core mechanics like the lame upgrades and weapon limitations are probably here to stay.",1708208943,1708208943,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Game is pretty awesome and follows fairly true to the original game.

Lets get into the bad before the good because there's much more praise than complaint.


Odd weapons that don't exist in the game.
Overclocks that do not exist in the game.
Spitballers look WEIRD AF compared to their look in game.
Life regen should be better explained, it's not HPS, HP5, it's HP10 which is a big difference.
Weird things in the game that are either not in DRG or just doesn't line up.
 -spitballers looks
 -red vines in biome that you cant destroy while in DRG it's almost essential.
The camera angle is almost amazing, there are often moments where the camera will make it look like theres no enemy/ies next to some terrain and i'll walk over and just lose a third of my life because the camera angle is kinda meh when it comes to that.

The good. 
So while there were the above issues, the game was ready to go from the gate, it is Early Access, but it feels fairly flushed out already, loved the alpha and beta. Most of the art style is very pretty, enemies look cool.
Missions are fun, love the secondary objectives. If you're looking for another top down roguelike but also love rocking and stoning, this is a great game, especially since they're not trying to gouge us for money.

I've played my fair share of survivor games, and tend to enjoy them but get bored relatively quickly. Vampire Survivors was a bit of an exception, that is a very satisfying game because you're crazy overpowered. This game is not Vampire Survivors.

This game is tough, it requires some real consideration of where you move, what weapons you pick, how you dig and funnel mobs, when you need to grind some exp from the swarm and when you need to go mining. There is strategy, there is difficulty and as you build yourself up there is occasionally that feeling of destruction as you overpower hordes of glyphids. 

Maybe this isn't for everyone, I remember seeing one person say the devs were ""scared"" to let you feel overpowered. The fact is, this is just a variation of survivor game and not everything has to be VS, that's what VS is for.

In this year of our lord 2024, I finally came to my senses and broke free of the absurdly grindy, unrewarding, microtransaction mienefield laden hell that was destiny and came out of the other side wondering a few things:

- Where are my friends?
- *Who* are my friends
- What is that giant orange ball in the sky, what the hell is this green stuff on the ground, and since when did real life not come with a streamer with no real personality trying to sell me on their preferred energy drink while staring mindlessly at their screen.

Then, finally, after I settled on no forthcoming answers, I realised that thanks to no longer donating to bungie's never ending charity grift, I had much more money and that I would need a new hobby; at this point I opened up steam, ignored the back catalogue that I swore I would one day make my way through (but not today) and picked up Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor. What do I think of it? Well. It's fun!

Not sure how the devs thought the minigun had a good balance when you can only fire forward and the whole game is running away from things that chase you constantly. Other weapons just feel very weak and it reflects in the damage stats at the end of the match.

Digging is a problem as well because non-digger dwarves take way too long to dig. Makes sense, right? Well, all of your end of stage enhancements come out of the stuff you dig so it just results in awful experience where you can barely upgrade while diggers are laughinggoldenkinghomer gif.

the gameplay loop:
you run around the map, mine as many ressource as you can while dodging or killing a ton of bugs. 
you regularily get upgrades for your weapons or base stats. you carry up to 4 weapons that you unlock during the run. meanwhile a timer runs out and after reaching its final destination, a boss will spawn. after killing the boss you have to ""rush"" to the landing pot or else game over. you do this 4 times and kill the big behemoth at level 5. after that your run is done and you start over again on a higher danger level or on a different (of 3) maps. 

but i would say content is lacking right now. dont get me wrong i havent unlocked everything yet and its fun to unlock stuff by doing little challanges, but 3 maps with the same structure is not enough. the bosses on lvl 1-4 are always the same. one is flying, one is walking and one is spitting. but basically they are just stronger standard enemies. 
the behemoth on lvl 5 is ALWAYS the same. destroy cocoons and kill behemoth. here the game needs more variety. 
i want different missions and not just wait till the same big unit appears. the final boss could use some variety as well. more creativity.

It's incredibly unbalanced, and before someone comments to ""git gud"", you literally can't because the game doesn't give you the tools needed to put up any kind of meaningful fight against the utter INSANITY of the hordes it throws at you. On one of my best Hazard 2 runs, I completed with literally 1 HP remaining, and don't even bother trying with Hazard 3. I can't even fathom what Hazard 4 or 5 would look like. Meta progression does next to nothing to enhance your character, and it's honestly impossible to even notice the ""buffs"". The whole charm of a survivor-like rogue-lite is to be able to create a build from nothing that is viable against the challenges thrown at you to eventually crescendo into a power fantasy where you become a weapon of mass destruction. That never happens here, and you constantly feel vulnerable and weak. Also, don't even get me started with the Hollow Bough biome; it's possibly the worst and most lazily cobbled together level design I've seen in any game, ever. 

In terms of technical issues, there are optimization issues where the frame rate sometimes stutters to a screeching halt out of nowhere, for no discernible reason. More annoying though is a frequent bug where the camera just kinda jarringly jolts multiple times in a row to catch up to your character.

TL;DR: Devs, we need better (and more fun) tools to fight these ridiculous hordes. Fix the technical issues. You got a good foundation here but it needs a lot of love.",1708203229,1708203229,False,24,1,0.542501270771026611,5,True,False,True

The game play consists of diving solo into a 5-stage mine.

There are 3 planets currently, and each planet has multiple hazard levels that you unlock as you level up your dwarves.

Gathering resources and upgrade materials feels satisfying. Unlocking over-clocks for guns is a little tedious, but I think it's required for these types of games.

I genuinely have a handful of totally valid issues with the game that keep me frustrated after every run. The weapons that I've experienced through the Scout and Gunner class are underwhelming both in their initial utility as well as the utility they provide through upgrades. I've had runs where I stick to upgrading a variety of weapons, or upgrading a specific weapon in hopes of having something that will do reasonable damage at the last stage of a level. I unfortunately have not found a way to keep my damage output high enough to complete either of the 2 missions I've attempted. I also have a big issue with the bosses of these levels having attack moves that are A: not present in other low-level enemies and B: completely fuck a player if they have not geared into the upgrades that help them (movement speed, mining speed, weaponry that prioritizes high health enemies, all of which are fairly useless until you get to the boss). I also have an issue with the unlock system, as I am now stuck at level 4, unable to progress unless I beat one of these stupid levels, or until I can get a class I don't enjoy playing (Gunner, bc fuck a weapon that only shoots at the enemies in front of your player in a game like this, wtf were they thinking making this his primary weapon) to level 25 inside the run. FUCK THAT! I am going to keep trying, because there is the chance that I'm just missing something but I would consider myself a fairly technical gamer and I feel like I have the ability to pick up on what is useful/appropriate technique in a simple game like this.

Currently new weapons are few and far between in a run, so it's really just buffing the ones you have with standard things like damage, reload, crit chance, range etc. You can't aim the weapons, yet most of them have very poor coverage or damage. So getting swarmed with 2/3 weapons (even with many upgrades) rarely feels powerful. 
There are no fun effects (from what I've found) like increasing projectile count, beam rotation speed, leeching + deal random damage when you heal etc. 
The runs can become very repetitive and grindy.

It's solo Deep Rock Galactic, but in a different package of being an action roguelike. That means most of the things that you've seen in the original game, you'll see here as well. Weapons, classes, voice-lines, music. There is hardly any new content besides the items that you get from the supply pod (and an occasional new weapon, but I think only Engineer had those) Even the little details like scoring a kill on a tough enemy with a supply pod. At times it actually feels like having a fever dream of playing Deep Rock Galactic simply because it all sounds exactly the same, save for the weapons. 

The amount of bugs simultaneously on the screen at times... Wow. It actually feels like you're playing against Zerg in StarCraft, especially if they get stuck on some impassable terrain. And they're having a lot of health, so you NEVER feel overpowered or strong. 

One of the things that rubbed me the wrong way, was the lack of depth other than using your WASD to move and aim. There would be times I'd really prefer having manual control of what exactly I want to shoot, primarily tanky elites. If a game wants me to kill it quickly (and actively punishes me for staying too long on the mission by making these enemies stronger) I'd much prefer an option to focus my damage on the target I actually need to kill first and foremost. 

Or, on several occasions the tactical genius of the gunner with a minigun would shine, and he'd lock onto the one small little bug slightly to the side, while the huge swarm was clawing it's way right in front of me. And that's with that specific gun behaving in a ""fires the direction you're facing"" and me staring EXACTLY at that big swarm in front of me. 

For the most part, for it's price and being a small rogue-like game, yeah, I'd probably recommend it, but it's... meh. It's pretty boring. There's not a lot of depth to it, and with the whole upgrade and unlock system, it quickly becomes a slow, grindy chore. There's simply not enough things that make it the replayable, addictive game that the other games in the genre are popular for. 

It does feel like it needs something else to it, a little more ""oomph"", but I can't quite figure out exactly what. Perhaps a more depth to it's mechanics and controls? Difficulty rework? Who knows. Time will tell if it becomes better or worse.",1708117862,1708196051,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I've played this game for about half an hour now and I love DRG and the DRG board-game; both are designed to make you think and plan ahead.  This is nothing like those except for the DRG graphics and audio.  So far there is zero depth, pun intended.

It's literally just walking about, the game handles attacking for you, which is kinda half the point of playing?  Walk about to avoid bugs.  Walk into rock to mine through it.  Walk into loot bugs to pickaxe them.  Walk into a resource pod to get upgrades.  Walk into XP spheres to gain XP.  Literally just WASD to move about, RMB pauses the game.

[b] PROS: [/b]
- Solid foundation, controls feel tight and the gameplay loop is fun. Much like Vampire Survivors, this will be a fun game to watch grow and change as it approaches its 1.0 launch. 

- Excellently combines ideas from two games. The mining and digging elements are a welcome addition to the Vampire Survivor-like/Auto-shooter genre and give this game a uniquely Deep Rock feel.

- A slick translation of Deep Rock Galactic's art for a different style of game. Despite all enemies being bugs, each variety has a clear silhouette and behaviors that make enemy types feel distinct. Frankly, it's just cool to see the world of Deep Rock Galactic from a different perspective.

[b] CONS: [/b]
- Crashes and other early access quirks. This stuff will certainly be ironed out, but as of 2/17/24, the game is fairly unstable. The game doesn't save mid-run, so crashes usually result in some sort of lost progress. As of this writing, I've hit around four crashes in my ten hours of game time. One crash erased my entire save forcing me to restart the game entirely as if I had never launched it before. Erasing saves is egregious even for early access. 

- Runs can feel too similar. Because new equipment and weapons unlock at such a slow pace, and because the random drops in game are so inappreciable, consecutive runs will blend together in a way that makes it feel like you're doing exactly the same thing over and over again.

- No character customization. I am not referring to the cosmetic customization, which is also missing (it would be extremely cool if we could import the look of our DRG characters), but loadout customization. Loadouts are unlockable presets that you must select one of (there appears to be three for each of the four classes). These loadouts aren't distinct enough to feel like significant choices, but lacking any sort of mixing and matching with starting stats and gear does also contribute to that samey feeling I mentioned before. I would also argue that customizing your loadout is a distinct aspect of the DRG flavor that would help Survivor stand out in a crowded sub genre.",1708115252,1708190267,True,1,0,0.5022391676902771,0,True,False,True

There are a few minor flaws with balancing and whatnot, but Ghost Ship has always excelled at listening to critique, so I trust most of these will be patched by the time the full version drops. 

DRG: Survivor is fun and engaging. In my opinion, it toes the line between needing to ""sweat"" and ""I am become death"" very well. I've obviously not played all that much (especially compared to the time I've sunk into the original) but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. For an early access game, it looks fantastic and runs better than most v.1 games. 

With regard to flaws, the only glaring one is that I seem to be progressing rather quickly. I think veterans of this genre might find it a bit easy or perhaps just short. But I say this knowing that it's not yet finished, so I'm not too bothered by it at present. 

Many people seem to have a problem with the difficulty level, but I don't feel the same at all. I'm most impressed by the games ability to make each class feel unique and therefore more memorable. I think it's excellent thus far and I'm excited to see where it goes in the future.

Many reviews already point out the glaring issues, so look there if you want many more details I likely missed.

Seriously, I only tried this out because it was DRG... You take that look away and it is an entirely unsatisfying, stressful, unrewarding (for said stress) and ultimately completely forgettable gaming experience. 

---Hazard 1 means throwing a lot of runs to get anything done and unlocked which just makes it feel like bloating to lenghten ""content"". Hazard 1 will have you sweating your little butts to progress a bit. How is this Hazard 1 lmao. Probably done to slow down progress and make it seem like there is more to the game then there really is... Which is problematic since succeeding a mission through great effort was such a joy in DRG, here you'll get a LOT of ""failed"" for a lot of effort... Currently, what little they did bring from DRG CLASHES violently with the survivor genre.

---I do not appreciate the dance you have to go through with the bosses (Avoid killing them, which can be a challenge) to mine stuff (makes it lose the ""survivor"" feel since beating enemies is NOT what you want to focus on at all, which is hilarious when they throw so many at you from every single directions at once) as beating the boss is actually not a good thing, especially when they give you only 30 seconds to escape the moment you finish it off meaning you can't even pick up the paltry XP reward dropped by the bosses (they just drop some XP, not even that much...), let alone do a bit of mining to get a few more nitra or gold. 

---The meta upgrades are so lackluster that they are utterly disappointing, completing a few runs just to have the options be to: upgrade damage by 2%, pick-up radius by 2%, etc.... Pathetic upgrades. Not looking for anything OP at all, but at least something to look forward to upgrading. Each time a run ends I feel nothing.
Also, the in-run upgrades are not too fun as well (just damage, reload and fire rate upgrades mostly). They feel better because they give faster gratification (when you roll the rarer upgrades, which are still just like the lower rarity ones, only give more of what their inferior counter-parts offer), but that's it. Not too interesting and will keep you on the razor edge of failure, which means that of the 15-ish minute of every run, not once will you feel like your build is powerful (until the very end where MAYBE you'll feel good about your build (not that there is much variations to play with) before it is yanked away from you barely a minute later when the run ends... maybe... and again, this is on Hazard one, not end-game difficulty). Never do you feel like you achieved a great build, never do you feel like you actually achieved much at all in fact. I felt mostly empty, the only thing keeping me in the run being the fact that if I didn't sweat my little ass off then i'd be bug food (not without a fight, even if the game is lackluster and I ALT-F4ed from the menu after buying some upgrades (had a decent run, so no anger whatsoever), not even wanting to bother exiting it normally... because I didn't even want to spend another second in that game's menu... That's how empty buying the upgrades made me feel).

---ALL classes but the scout are locked at the start... yay, another way to make you grind which just ends up making the game feel bloated with mostly unfun and not-so-rewarding grind. The fact that all other classes are locked isn't REALLY necessarily a problem, but it certainly doesn't help me get rid of the opinion that they are padding the game.

---One of the best things from DRG, the bar and ordering drinks, is entirely absent. No small chill area, just kicked to the menu when you finish a run. Every time the runs end, I feel nothing and don't really look forward to going for another run. Much of the charm of DRG is actually absent as this feels like a coat of paint and nothing more.


Refunded and will just play DRG instead... as well as other Vampire-survivors-like games that are on the market. A lot are better in every aspect apart from IP. 
Such a complete disappointment from a game using the DRG IP... It might get better in the future, but I am tired of EA titles using the excuse that it is EA for being so lackluster, so empty feeling on release (if there is no soul, adding more paint coatings won't change much now will it). Might not be a ""cash grab"" per say, but getting real close there... especially when you consider how cheap or outright free (even though they shouldn't be) many of the competitors are. If one compares pricing, only reason this game costs more than the others is because of the DRG IP, otherwise it should be priced so much lower than those other games (if price reflects quality by comparison).
It's like putting the apple logo on an actual apple and upping the price, even though the apple itself is not juicy and way too starchy, leaving you not only unsatisfied but grossed out...

Just bought this one yesterday and had a hard time turning it off, addictive as anything. Just one more run!

It may not be the ""deepest"" game (pun intended) in the world but for less than 10$ it´s an awesome game to sit down and just enjoy. Very polished, no bugs at all so far. 

The weapon variety is good, I´ve unlocked something like 10-15 weapons and very likely more to come. Some of them are a bit sam-ey but most of them are great fun and the way they work add another layer and you have to style your play accordingly.
The balance of the game might not be quite 100% yet, would perhaps be good to be able to have easy/normal/hard. But then again you get hazard levels unlocked so the hard part will probably be unlocked as you progress. 
It´s quite challenging and I haven´t yet finished a level but getting closer. Not sure why people are complaining that it´s too hard, I´m far from a good player but still making good progress. 

Finding the right combination of weapons is a puzzle but fun, some don´t work well together but that just adds to the overall challenge and replayability.

Not everyone has the same taste in games but reading some of these reviews just makes me wonder if we´re playing the same game. 
Give it a chance, I for one absolutely love it. 

I recommend it for what it is and what it´s supposed to be.
And for 9$ if I play it for more than 4 hours that´s a win in my book. 10/10.",1708169416,1708185737,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is not feasible to stay put and fight, as your weapons do not deal enough damage to clear out the massive waves of enemies, so you are forced to constantly move and explore, which the game encourages with its side objectives and minerals to mine.  So you kite enemies as you explore the map, mining minerals and digging caves to make shortcuts.  This results in several problems:
- Enemy swarms are massive, and you don't know where they will spawn from.  Combined with the random map generation, you can easily trap yourself...  You might be kiting the swarm behind you, but you've reached a map dead end and the only place you can dig yourself out of is now blocked by a new swarm, and as previously stated, your weapons aren't strong enough to clear a path.  So cross your fingers that you can sprint through the enemy swarm without dying!
- Constantly kiting enemies means you're not picking up experience they drop as they die.  This usually means the optimal strategy is to find a good map spot to kite swarms in a large circle so you can eventually pick up the experience.  If you don't find a way to pick the experience up, you'll end up under leveled, further fueling the cycle of feeling under powered.

Other issues and complaints:
- The drop pod countdown timer is unforgiving.  If you get unlucky and it drops behind a massive swarm, you might be unable to get to it in time,  or without charging straight through the swarm (which will likely kill you).  I've lost more than one run after defeating the final boss because I died trying to get to the drop pod.
- Balance issues galore.  Some guns feel completely worthless, such as Recon Scout's starting gun that shoots in cardinal directions.  On Haz 3, I have to position very carefully and focus fire half a clip to kill a single grunt.
- Classses are less unique than you'd hope.  Driller felt the most different, getting a mining speed boost the longer you mine, but that interesting aspect was completely dropped for the Driller's second specialization (which instead gave reduced your damage and increased status damage, a tradeoff that you probably won't notice).
- Upgrades aren't that interesting. Percentage upgrades on damage or reload time are helpful, but boring.
- Overclocks aren't that interesting. I'd be able to forgive the levelup upgrades for not being interesting if overclocks did a bit more, but a lot of them are also just percentage upgrades... Double ammo capacity with slower reload?  I guess that's useful, but it really doesn't change anything interesting about how I'm playing.
- Needs polish overall (I know it's still early access).  I'd love a stats screen on the main menu that shows me previous runs.

And as I said at the beginning, you really never get over the feeling of being underpowered.  Maybe some people prefer this, but eventually becoming overpowered is my favorite part of these kind of games.  Perhaps I wouldn't mind feeling underpowered if they saved it for the highest Haz levels, but even Haz 1 has this feeling... You constantly scrape by, complete the missions, and hope you are lucky enough to make it back to the drop pod.

Miniscule stat upgrades as meta progression? Give me a break. Most weapons feel limp and useless. Very few overclocks are any good, and guess what, no reroll.

Rerolls and upgrade selection is also begging for an overhaul - all upgrades are just bland stat raises, moreover, the randomness is garbage - you can consistently reroll all your gold for gray crap despite minmaxing luck, and at the same time you can almost guarantee that if you reroll in a shop with low nitra it will roll a red upgrade that you can't afford adding insult to injury. 

Weapons that you can aim, the aiming is very poor - the dwarf rotation speed is very slow, with keyboard and mouse there is no mouse aiming, so you can't aim reliably unless you aim straight up/left/down/right. And it isn't any better on a controller too - I don't know how can you screw it up! 

The joy of coming up with some awesome build is so goddamn rare, it feels like you're feasting on scraps of stale bread when you manage to roll some good upgrades and overclocks. But you can forget about the most fun you get out of rogue-lites, when you manage to build an absolute beast of a character that's so ridiculously powerful it wipes everything on and off the screen, that game sadly doesn't have it. And how can it? Every level you're blocked by every way imaginable from leveling - the time limit is merciless. 30 seconds to extract, and every time you're forced to abandon huge pools of xp that just lie there, it feels absolutely terrible! WHY?! Every single time, even if you're doing well.

The boss of each level, if you're struggling, it's like the game engages in some sort of twisted sadism, ramping up the difficulty the longer it takes you to dispose of the boss, and at the same time, oh the irony, if you're good enough to kill it quickly, you're still prevented from doing some farming and gathering xp and powering up for deeper levels, nope, screw you, boss dead - no time to collect xp, get yer bum into the extraction drill, you got 30 seconds asshole. Fun - shattered.

The magnet pickup drops are so rare they don't make any difference. The shock spire overclock helps, but good luck rolling the weapon AND the overclock, this is horrible. 

The game badly needs a redesign of weapons, synergies, upgrades, overclocks, meta progression, christ, at least do a crude DE-balancing pass so you can make crazy builds at least based on stupid high stats - imagine char with crazy high luck, or +200% mining speed, or infinite xp pull range, or dodge. Add some cool OP items that you can find deep under that you can equip. Make em do something cool. Come on, breathe goddamn it, have some pulse! Add collecting all xp if you make it to the pod, or combine off-screen xp gems into a bigger gem and put it somewhere close. Oh and most upgrades in the support pod are utter trash.

Anyway, somehow the start of the game being good makes all the faults even worse - so the game has to pay the disappointment tax on top of everything else. I really hope this game receives some dev love and loses these issues. But in its current Early Access state I don't recommend it.

-the upgades need tweaked- the regular upgrades feel too weak unless you get epic or higher rarity and while i do think fixing my previous gripe would help this upgrades like movement and mining speed feel almost negligible unless stacked or above rare rarity which sucks when movement speed and mining speed feel necessary for the last level or 2 even on haz 1.

-build variety seems limited- this is the gripe i am worried the least about since the game is in early access and trickle feeding us items and weapons for builds with extends the life of the game it is still an issue i have because it makes the runs feel the same every time i think there should be more weapon type buffs like the lightning crit chance upgrade for example that reward you for using the same type of damage or firing type or maybe something completely opposite where you get more reload the more unique firing types you have. like i said this is the one i'm least worried about but  i do think it will become more of an issue as the games lifespan increases.",1708179075,1708179075,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I played a bunch of different survivor-autofire games and usually enjoyed them. And I played a lot of the original Deep Rock Galactic - time for a win, so I thought.

* The game has unique mechanics like digging and harvesting resources that can have a lot of potential
* The game is stressful from start to end compared to other survivor games, where your build might be lagging behind in early or midgame, but in this game you're almost always close to death and never own the stage.
* I've got my ass beaten multiple times on the easiest stage, which is normally a good intro to the game to learn the mechanics and get a feeling for what builds could work, but this was constant stress.
* There are no real builds. You just have weapons, and they get better. There are no secondary items that improve one stat and worsen another, that you carefully choose to follow a certain build, that becomes powerful eventually. 
* The supply drops are weak. One per level, close to worthless (except for killing elites) 
* No real RNG fun, normally you hope for getting one of the specific items you desire for your build so that you finally own the stage, because it changes the dynamic. Here it is just ""meh, just pick the highest rarity and improve my weapon a bit"".

Graphically the game is solid. However, the classes seem to all blend together. The weapons are underwhelming, over-clocks are underwhelming, the bonus and level-up options are also underwhelming. At no point do you feel ""overpowered"" and able to blindly clear waves en masse. I was able to upgrade two weapons in a single run to 18 and I felt weak as the gunner.

Unlocking weapons at certain levels only to not be able to use the weapon's unlocked ability until the next round or next drop is a waste of time.

Maybe it is just me but the Dreadnaught at the end, beyond it's jumping mechanic, needs some sort of indicator as to when it is going to hit you. I've had times where the Dreadnaught vaults over me without a scratch and then other  times where he jumps over me but I end up getting one-shotted? Which leads me to the game-play loop of having to delay, delay, delay from bosses to mine and gather more. However, with how minimal upgrades are, even the % damage ones, you quickly get eaten.

The game lives from its good graphics and the charm of the Deep Rock Galactic universe. Unfortunately, the game mechanics are often uninspired and sometimes horrible.

[h3]Fight or Run?[/h3]
Worst of all, the game punishes you for doing a good job. The more enemies you kill, the more new enemies will spawn. The many enemies make it more difficult for you to collect the precious minerals. As a result, you actively avoid killing enemies and spend most of your time running away to collect the minerals as quickly as possible before fighting becomes unavoidable. If you kill a big wave of bugs really quick you'll summon the boss before even discovering half of the map.

[b]If you kill a lot of bugs quickly, you should be rewarded and not punished with even more bugs![/b]

In the end, you often have to choose between fighting and mining resources. As a result, you usually miss out on a lot of minerals or experience orbs at the end of the level. That feels very unsatisfying to me.

[h3]Upgrades[/h3]
The upgrade system isn't particularly great or innovative, but not too bad either. Surely many of the upgrades feel relatively meaningless: +6% reload speed here, +2 movement speed there.
The ""overclocking upgrades"" have a bigger impact. Unfortunately, there are weaknesses here too. The upgrades are not balanced. Some upgrades are very strong while others feel completely useless. And of course it's those overclocking upgrades that can't be rerolled *sigh*

[h3]Progression[/h3]
[b]Upgrades:[/b] As already known from DRG, you can invest minerals to tweak some numbers like movement speed or damage. Well, not particularly groundbreaking game design, but why not.
[b]Milestones:[/b] The progress of unlocking weapons and classes feels good.
[b]Hazard Level:[/b] This feels extremly grindy. A little while ago I unlocked Hazard 4 and one of the biome goals is to reach level 55(!) with the Recon Scout. At that point my highest level for any character was 14. FML.

[h3]Rock and Stone[/h3]
Most autoshooters offer a boring, dull environment. The destructible environment of DRG: Survivor brings a new aspect to the genre. Thinking about how to use the environment to your advantage is fun and challenging.

[h3]Summary[/h3]
Take away the graphics, take away DRG and you'll get a mediocre game at this point. It can still become a very enjoyable experience if the developers fix some weird game mechanics.",1708175482,1708175546,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,True

I am gonna continue playing because I survivor games tend to really bloom in late experience. So I am just reviewing the core of the game right now...

Again consider everything as 'so far from what I have seen'

General issues I find with the game:
- Balancing: tries to hard to balance things, making your choices useless. Basically there is an obvious way to go about things. Or you take the risk and hope for luck, but I haven't seen that pay off so far.
- Lack of settings: I haven't seen any options to customize your experience, for instance the 30 seconds to get to your ship, yeah screw that, I wanna be able to change that whenever I want to.
- Lack of consistent content: for example a campaign or maps (seeds for maps maybe would work?) that are always the same, everything is pretty much random. I wanna be able to strategize for my run, have a specific route, know exactly when and where I can get a magnet for example.
- Stats: It all comes down to stats, a bit too much. You got reload speed, fire rate, damage, and some specific upgrades.. And each of those is grouped, so you have to make sure you have the right group combination to get the most out of your stats. For example you have, damage for electric weapons, but it won't work on kinetic weapons. So all your weapons need to be the same group (electric for example).
- Upgrades: There is a chance you will get 3 useless upgrades to choose from, you have the option to reroll, but that doesn't mean the reroll will guarantee fitting upgrades for your kit. I tried a ""reroll-run"", so basically I would only pick what I really need, otherwise I reroll, that was my worst run. So you often have to pick upgrades you don't want, which means you can never have a ""perfect"" run.

You cannot stay still in this game long enough for this to be viable because, you never have enough fire power to make this work and have to keep on the move or die.

Some things I think would be good (entirely based on my preference):
- Hard mode for each hazard level with increased rewards for the risk.
- Hard Upgrade Cards: get more XP/Gold/Nitra, but enemies become stronger
- Endless mode (no upgrade points earned though)
- DOT and AOE abilities since kiting is the core mechanic
- Traps (laser wall, mine, cave-in etc): things we can drag enemies over for extra damage

1: spawn in on haz 1 (haz 1 is the easiest difficulty)
2: run around mining gold and nitra while shooting bugs.
3: oh lord that's a lot of bugs
4: level up a few times and get some boring upgrades that dont feel impactful in any capacity.
5: HOLY SHIT THAT'S A LOT OF BUGS
6: run around digging through walls to escape the 20000 bug armada behind me and pray to god that the game plays nice and doesn't completely surround me with bug spawns.
7: An unreasonable amount of bugs
8: bait the elite into the supply pod so it dies instantly.
9: repeat until i get unlucky on step 6 and get fully surrounded and die.
BONUS: get a legendary upgrade in step 4 that lets me kill one (1) more bug per magazine.

However, as many people have stated, the upgrades are mediocre. Increase damage/hit rate/speed/mining speed/armor. Couple of more, but you get the point. There are no combos, no unique upgrades to make a weapon especially OP or anything of the sort (although you can change damage type and add some modifications). The game definitely missed that in my opinion.

Some other things that tick me wrong:
 - There are weapons that attack only in front of you, which makes them really, really bad and a factor to never get them instead of turrets/other weapons that attack around you.
- Some grenades go to really random and non optimal places.

Needed QoL - when I hover a locked Class Mod to be able to see how to unlock it.

Heads up: there is a goal to equip four kinetic weapons. I did that and then I changed their damage to elemental because it works for me. Well, I didn't complete the goal. Shouldn't be a thing.

Pros:
- Game feels good to play, i haven't experienced any bugs so far
- Core mechanic is fun, adds enough to stand out from other survivor type games, classes feel different enough from eachother
- Biomes add another layer to difficulty
- Style/Sound design (especially exploding aliens, gathering exp)
- Each stage feels busy with objectives and loot to collect

Things to be improved imo:
- Progression feels really slow (even compared to games like Death Must Die, where it also takes a while to ramp up). I think lowering level requirement to unlock new classes/sub classes is needed
- Let players use at least very first overclock when they reach level12 on a new weapon for the first time
- Kinetic weapons feel kind of bland, would love some better visual feedback on them
- Let us lock upgrades in post mission shop, so that players can work towards unlocking them during next dive
- There needs to be better variety with Dreadnoughts (one for each biome or depending on hazard level)

I was expecting a twin-stick shooter, but it's not really ""twin-stick"". It's one stick, you run around and sometimes select upgrades. Everything else is automated.
The game is heavily reliant on RNG. If you don't get a good set of upgrades/items at the beginning, you won't be able to kill a boss and the level will keep throwing more and more at you until you die. You shouldn't be able to look at five items and know ""Yeah, I won't make this run, may as well start over"".
The bugs getting stronger when the boss has been active for too long happens incredibly fast, and they will be able to catch up to and surround you after around 90 seconds, leading to a guaranteed game over.
There is no real targeting system. Weapons aim at the nearest enemy, or sometimes certain extra variables are added. When there's one small enemy near you, and a boss slightly further away, the game will prioritize the small enemy for auto-target because it's always proximity based, unless you have a very specific overclock or certain weapons.
Gunner is just very underwhelming. His primary requires that you stop moving and look at the enemies constantly running at you in order to shoot them, which leaves you open for close encounters and flanks.

Progression in this game sucks. Every level increase gives you a stupid stat bonus. (more dmg, more reload, more fire rate, more elemental.) Theres nothing that adds any variety to your weapons. nothing that adds another projectile, bigger area, any kind of variation, that significantly changes your setup. with 100 minutes in, every good run i did, felt so lacking and unfun, cuz it felt like i was heavily underpowered compared to the enemies, cuz i had to balance health, exp gain, radius gain, dmg, fire rate, whatever tf else. it felt like a huge chore.

The little drop pods are supposed to be an event that should help you in a major way, but the starting bonuses are so terrible. its more beneficial to use the drop pod as a weapon, and 1 shot the boss, than actually getting whatever reward it had.

Boss' feel like a huge pain. theyre super bullet spongy (obviously), but they also mean the end of the level. if you kill the boss, youre given 30 seconds to leave (not nearly enough time, to finish gethering all your progress), or you train the boss, and get constantly swarmed.
being given 30 seconds to leave feels absolutely TERRIBLE! youre punished for doing the very thing, youre supposed to! All the ads you killed for exp, are wasted, because youre not given enough time to collect it, and leave. 30 seconds is such a stupid move from the devs. ""we dont want people farming floors!"" my ass.

None of the career progression is very fun. to unlock special mods for your weapons, you need to get them to level 12, which is hard to do passively! because youll be spending most of your time upgrading your passive skills, or your main weapon/s. so you kind of need to go out of your way to specifically upgrade some random boomerang, just to see if the mods on it are worth using.

Nother thing i thought was funny. Being a Deep rock galactic, game. i wouldve thought maybe they woudve had some kind of coop? seeing that they got bosco as your pal? but nothing.
idk. This is a stupid review. im just frustrated with the state of the game. it simply isnt very fun.. granted this is on the 17th, but even then..
Just go buy Vampire survivors for the mean time. atleast THAT has coop, lol
ill give the game a month or two? see how it improves? but right now, i cant recommend..

I failed english! so dont take this as some IGN journalist review. The game is alright. some people have fun, thats good! But i really cant recommend it. it feels like a huge chore. theres no destroying waves of enemies. no interesting weapons, or buffs? its just mining rock, maybe stone, maybe gold or nitra. getting attacked by a boss, then punished for doing good.",1708156361,1708156506,False,2,0,0.50761568546295166,0,True,False,True

The game does feel early access as it stands, but I'd fully expect cleanup by release.
Each class has an interesting identity, but right now I would not consider all of them of equal power. Certain things feel powerful by default, and other things feel HEAVILY reliant on good run RNG. Survivor games are always going to have RNG, but the slower pace of this game (which I inherently like) makes spending 20 minutes of grinding, then failing a DPS check, feel a bit bad.
Im not completely sure I love how players have no control of firing weapons after they reload. There are many instances where weapons may just fire into walls if you are attempting to mine an ore.
Also, I think the cheese of exploding bug chaining and dropping the supply pod on final zone boss are both too powerful. It feels optimal to do those two things on every single zone in the game, minimizing player option.
On the positive side, I think players feel constant agency about how to navigate/farm the map. The progression is fun, the game is hard, and the unlock system keeps you curious and invested.

I'm a big fan of Survivor games, played most of the top tier ones. I gotta say, this game is loads of fun and good value for it's price. I love GSP and the price of this game is low, so it's worth the price. But otherwise, it isn't the best Survivor game to sink time into.

Pros:
- Easy survivor game to get into, super easy to understand. Simple
- DRG skin, fun and thematically exciting
- Objectives and digging are cool, changes things up a bit but not too much
- Getting OP is very fun

Cons:

- Upgrades early on are just kinda boring, takes a long time to get powerful
- Needing to upgrade a weapon to 12 then end the run just to unlock overclocks for it feels a bit grindy for grind sake.
- +% upgrades are mostly the only upgrades outside of overclocks (which means if you dont have them on your weapon yet your first runs are crazy uninteresting) and there aren't enough synergies to make it fun like Halls of Torment.
- Glyphid exploders in every swarm gets boring, since early on it's just about triggering the explosion then running out of range over and over. A fun gimmick at first but every swarm gets boring.

It's a survival rogue-lite, but it has some cool unique features.

As you move around the map and slay hordes of enemies, you also get to mine for resources that allow you to improve your character for that run, as well as unlocking permanent improvements for future games.

That said there def is a lack of interesting upgrades. Every upgrade is just a percentage of more damage. They have a few more interesting ones, like adding more beams onto beam weapons, but their seen rarely due to their rarity. And a lot of the overclocks are just shifting stats around, rather than actually changing your gameplay.

There's some things in the game that are sort of antithetical to 'hands off' auto-shooters, namely the fact that at the end (sometimes in the middle) of every level - you have to kill a named elite target. 

Now, in a shooter you go ahead and click on the enemy, in this game you are more or less stuck waiting on whether or not your character decides to hit an elite or not. I have sat in some missions for over 10 minutes just watching my goofball scout whif a cryo grenade at 1 enemy, further away than the horde behind me including the elite. 

This is infuriating gameplay - even just switching it so you always target elites first would fix a lot of the things that don't feel right with the game. 

Mining feels alright, the upgrades feel a bit like busy work but you can swap over the special gems just like DRG. 

All in all, couple hours in, I'd say it's a bit more than a DRG IP money grab, I'm glad they chose early access so this thing can cook. I'm throwing it a thumbs up, but in my heart of hearts: I'm 50/50 right now.",1708148476,1708148514,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

And please get rid of the stall mechanics. I'm not quite sure how to do that, but the player should never, ever be made to feel bad about beating the boss.

It's so disappointing to see that the game can't be played with friends. I was so hyped for a second when I saw deep rock galactic survivor, thinking I'd be able to finally play such a game with my friends. But alas. Again another vampire survivors type game that doesn't offer multiplayer.

The two main problems are that progression is far too slow and enemies are way too strong, and as a result, you will feel very weak at almost all times during a run due to your limited options, while other survivor games are more about finding cool combinations of weapons to become overpowered, this really won't happen in DRG Survivor. 

You can't really stand and fight, you need to constantly be on the move and running away from swarms to create pathways via the mining mechanics, and even then the enemies are so numerous that you might just mine your way into the mid section of a swarm. Further, due to the number of tough enemies constantly pouring in and following you, you will constantly fail at secondary objectives and lose out on precious resources, making you even weaker during a run. 

There are weapons that fire in the direction that you're facing, but because you're constantly on the run, these are much less useful than weapons that target enemies automatically. I know survivors games are supposed to be simple, but I think a fix for this would be to simply add functionality to the mouse/ second thumbstick so that you can actually aim this class of weapon. 

Finally, if you manage to get to the last part of a mission and fight the dreadnought, the dreadnought can very likely kill you in one hit. Most enemies just walk towards you or fire bullets, but the dreadnought has a pouncing attack that, while decently telegraphed, has a hit box that's very generous for the dreadnought and can deal enough damage to one-shot kill you. Add on to the fact that you're navigating through a swarm of smaller enemies, cave walls, and even loot bugs that can get in your way and you have a very real issue with dodging this attack. so even though you powered through 4 difficult stages of grinding, you have very little leniency in the actual boss fight.

All of this is described while playing on Hazard 1, by the way. I can't even imagine how one would beat a run on the maximum difficulty.",1708143819,1708143843,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game itself is superb. It is everything that I wished for.
What really puts me off is the difficulty scale. IMO, it is just too hard.

Also, one has too little time to get back to the escape pod, which is generally overrun by bugs. Many times I've died while trying to just finish the mission.

Mining gold and nitra alllows you to purchase upgrades in between runs. Just like regular ol' DRG, mining for materials is also an important part of meta progression. All the minerals such as bismor, jadiz, and croppa are here and can be used to purchase permanent upgrades. You can also sell these resources like you can in DRG.

I'd say either make the upgrades massively stronger, or decrease the cost substantially and let us upgrade them a whole lot more than 12 times.

The Good:
- The game itself is smooth and the graphics are good considering what type of game this is.
- The controls are ok
- You definitely know that you are playing a DRG spinoff from the bugs, quotes, weapons, and dwarves.
- The game doesn't cost much.
The Bad:
- Mission control never shuts up.
- The grind is real. You are not going play one or two rounds and feel like you are anywhere for you power level. You will have to play many rounds before you start to notice any kind of true increase in your ability to fight.
- You cannot aim your weapons, any of them so you have to do a lot of kite work.
The Ugly:
- There is almost never enough time to gather materials.
- When you kill the dreadnought you get 30 seconds to get back to your ship. This should either be taken away, or increased to allow players to go and search the map.
- When you get to the last boss it seems like there are so many bugs that kiting is the only thing you can do because your weapons do almost nothing to the Dreadnought.
- Once a weapon is fully leveled up, it should stop showing up on the weapon choice screen. I don't know about anyone else but this to me means that the weapons is not fully leveled up. If it is then that means that the level up is a wasted slot.
Overall:
This is an early access game and I believe that with some work could be a great game. At this stage of the game though if you are not a DRG fan I would recommend holding off. When they final get the game polished and more balanced then I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes DRG and Rogue games.

However I can only *barely* recommend this game. More so if you like DRG. Because as an autoshooter, it leaves a lot to be desired. Halls of Torment is $5, half the price, and a lot more fun.

The biggest problem is that the roguelike element is pretty lacking. Your choices are more damage, faster reloads, or faster firing rate. You get some variety in weapon types, but there's almost no mixing-and-matching to create builds which is what makes autoshooters like Soulstone Survivors or Halls of Torment so great.

The second biggest problem, and this is a big one, is that there is no autoaim. Which means the majority of your survivability relies on navigating tiny avenues between bugs. If you're trying to kill an elite, you can't target that elite. Even the 'target highest health enemy' pickup will work against you if you're trying to kill an elite which is lower health than another nearby bug. Being able to clear paths with autoaim is a core concept to autoshooters. The mining through rock is a fun way around this, but the game really needs cursor autoaim.

As it stands, I imagine the game will get very repetitive very quickly due to the inability to experiment with build types from what I saw 2 hrs in.

A minor complaint is that when I got to the end of Hazard 1, after several failed attempts, I was about to kill the boss when he suddenly leapt into the air and on top of me with no telegraphing. He did 100 pts of damage (more than half my health) and killed me instantly. That isn't fun. It needs a warning animation and an indicator of where he'll land, even if it is only a quarter or half second warning.

Overall it looks great and it's fun and worth $10. But doesn't measure up against other autoshooters in early access. Looking forward to see where the devs take this though, as I loved DRG. Give us build variety and synergy.

Edit: After playing a couple more hours, I have to say it is very very repetitive very quickly. Hope the game improves soon.",1708027999,1708136698,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

This review is after only a few hours of gameplay, and this is more of a first impression than a Deep Dive, so take it with a grain of salt.

Pros:
- Unique mining mechanic has you collecting ores and lets you dig escape tunnels
- Has all the same colorful and quirky style of its namesake
- Its a difficult game and feels more rogue-like than others in the genre
- Mission objectives are completed fairly quickly, then you progress to the next stage with potentially new objectives, keeping things a little fresher

Cons:
- The weapons and shooting are one of the weaker features
- Guns either fire in a fixed direction, at the closest/strongest target, or only fire based on your dwarf's facing (you cannot aim other than to move)
- There is basically a soft timer for each mission, which is too short to complete some objective types, which require you to move quickly all around the map
- There are not enough ""magnet"" pickups that drop, which combined with the level timer and the 30 second drop pod timer, means you will be leaving a LOT of xp behind
- The map is a little too small, and sometimes you will be forced into a corner and surrounded on all sides while your weapons are generally ineffective at dispersing large swarms of high hp bugs until they are upgraded
- Mining is relegated simply to gathering minerals and making shortcuts through walls, due to the requirement that you be constantly moving to complete the mission and collect as much as you can before you have to finish the level, you are very limited in how you can use the terrain to your advantage
- The upgrade system is uninspired and seems to favor giving the same upgrade over and over. Weapons have to be ""leveled"" up in order to access overclocks, which can take most of a mission to complete, and the overclocks themselves are bland and unexciting
- There is a real issue with the isometric terrain/objects hiding bugs behind them, and sometimes hazards like exploding plants spawn underneath minerals
- The bonus objective types are very similar (just collect x amount of something) and don't add anything to the gameplay
- The dreadnought boss is very bland and far too punishing, it can kill you by leaping near you and if you don't have enough move speed or are in a tight spot with bugs/terrain, it will take you out in one hit. There are no other mechanics to it than watch it very closely and hope you have enough movement speed
- The progression system seems to be based on grinding experience on each of the classes and gathering minerals for global upgrades, there don't seem to be ways to control what build/weapons/upgrades you want to use or focus on other than picking a subclass and ""rerolling"" the random choices in a mission
- The xp orbs are far too bright, and the overuse of bloom combined with darkened screen edges is incredibly straining on the eyes

Overall the game seems to suffer from the challenge of trying to mash two types of games together and ends up being somewhat mediocre in both areas. I think this might be a game to keep an eye on in a year or so, but in its current state, there are more interesting games of the same kind to play.",1708136587,1708136587,False,6,0,0.537689805030822754,0,True,False,True

The one big problem I have with the game is the difficulty scaling. The game gets very hard very fast and constantly has swarms of bugs around you, making it hard to survive and ultimately feel powerful.

Another thing I don't like is the resupply pods with 'artifacts' making it so that you have to first mine out the area where they spawn, and then stand in the ring for a couple of seconds. It makes them hard to collect and get the artifacts when the bugs are swarming around you at the same time.

The guns are also not designed super well for what you are trying to do. Without manual aiming, it is almost impossible to be hitting the bugs that you want to hit.

Other than that, this game is a lot of fun and worth a try. I'm hoping the devs will make this game much better and improve on it eventually to where it can succeed a lot.",1708136541,1708136541,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Or you could just have known it is in the same genre as the game that started the Survivors genre, Vampire Survivors 


This game has similar style, the differences though, are huge. 

You mine minerals, this gives you EXP and lets you reroll with gold, upgrade stats between stages during a run with gold and nitra and upgrade passives between runs with the other minerals 

Which means you will be farming

The thing is, you don't have endless time, you passively kill things and the time ticks on and you will summon the boss and it gets harder and harder so you need to balance the resources gathering with the killing 

Now DRG is known for destructible environments and this has walls that you can dig through, which lets you make choke points and avoid hordes

It means that on top of doing damage you need a bit of movement and mining speed for pushing through a wall while a horde is crawling up your kester 


The differences between classes seems pretty good, different flavors of damage and different specialties 

I had a driller run, with sludge pump OC and lots of damage and the screen was melting on hazard 1

The dialog lines fit and the particle effects and sound design are great

But for the same price point you can pick yourself up vampire survivors which is 10x more complex with more replay value.
This game lacks what makes those games severely fun which is LOTS of synergies, 
but picks up a survivor feature that i don't particularly enjoy which is no aiming, it works for vampire survivors but with a game that has such a focus on Single target focus a couple bad overclocks that do that for you isn't enough, especially when it's between targetting highest hp or more damage. 

I want to like this, but it genuinely isn't fun, 
The dreadnoughts attack pattern is boring and it's health seems to be a DRAMATIC increase compared to anything within the first 4 levels, even inside the 5th level none of the smaller eggs compare.
Which comes into the upgrade system, because it's obvious that you'd need to focus on those more to help, but it's so incremental that 60% of the upgrades don't seem worth investing into.

Also dude, having to fully level up a gun just to use overclocks is obnoxious as hell, 
Do a full run purely so i can do a run with the actual gun???
Make it so theres a smaller amount of overclocks originally but using the gun unlocks more/better overclocks.

Vampire Survivors is one of my all time favorite games.  A dear friend of mine got me into DRG, and I loved that as well.  I had nothing but high hopes going into this, but the game needs so much work to live up to its potential.  

Starting with the good, the game looks, sounds, and runs VERY well, and I am surprised at how well DRG translates over into this art style and isometric perspective.  I really like how the devs captured the feeling of the original, with side objectives, the mining system, and even mineral trade all being integrated in a charming fashion.  I also like the integration of stage hazards, like the ones in the Molten Core, that allows for maneuvering the horde into them for a massive AOE clear.  It is a shame then, that the gameplay outside of these systems really, really falters.

Vampire Survivors is hard at first, yes, but it becomes easier as you unlock the many items, characters, and upgrades.  The game, and genre by extension, are all about the power fantasy of slowly becoming this walking instrument of death.  It is even in the tagline ""be the bullet hell"".  Yes, you need to work to get to that point, but the game is a spectrum of difficulty.  You gradually get more powerful.  Here, you don;t feel that at all.  The upgrades don't really feel as impact because the hordes feel more relentless.  I think the maps being limited exacerbate this feeling; as do the amount of rocks to get stuck on.  While the mining is the point, I cannot help but feel like it is incompatible with the Survivors genre.  

In VS and other spin offs, the movement is the key way you survive.  The hordes feel manageable because of freedom of movement.  Your weapons also play into this, with different types that also move differently of each other.  The guns here feel the same, I'm sorry.  The spreads are different, yes, and the different damage type system is actually really interesting, but the weapons don't feel fun, especially starting out.  Even with a level 1 lightening rod, pentagram, or garlic in VS, these weapons feel unique and get you thinking about different play styles and builds you can incorporate to boost their effects.  I just do not feel that motivation here.  

I am now going to be blunt.  This game is BORING.  Painfully so.  VS, Holocure, Boneraiser Minions, etc have a LOT of flash.  From the chest opening animations, to the unique sounds and visual effects of all the weapons, to the fusion/union mechanics completely keeping the player engaged; these give players aspects to latch onto to make the walking around less monotonous. this has a whole mining system yet somehow feels LESS complete because of the lack of the above.  Even the side objectives, which I really like, don't feel as frantic or interesting as the tasks on the new Among Us map in VS.  

It is clear that there is a deep love of DRG here, but somehow this game failed to capture all of the charm of the original beyond a surface level.  Despite this, there is enough effort here to make me optimistic for this game's future, and I genuinely hope this game improves into something great.",1708131172,1708131172,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I like the new mechanics they made for a survivor game like interacting and destroying the environment that you're in and the graphics and style are gorgeous but that's pretty much where the pros end. The game feels super grindy skills-wise, the difficulty feels like it amps up way too fast, barely giving you any time to upgrade enough throughout the run and there's nothing unique or special about the skills (it's all your basic stuff like fire rate, dmg, armor and etc, I wish they had just added a few extra unique skills like literally every other survivor game out there that made runs feel more unique and fun discovering new buffs). The thing that's truly a deal breaker is how the Gunner's lead storm gun only shoots the way you're facing like... If you're going to make bosses fast af that I need to constantly run away to avoid being smushed, then make it so that the gunner class can shoot the nearest enemy or the highest hp enemy because as it stands I just can't use gunner efficiently. I have to rely on guns that shoot in multiple directions at once or use a worse gun than lead storm to target the nearest enemy which is so frustrating. Like great my Lead storm has fire dmg and is lvl 15 but guess what, I need to constantly face a boss that catches up to me within a second so I get a solid second to do full dmg on it before I need to run away again only to repeat this awful cycle meanwhile there are acid spiders flinging acid from every-which-way all the while stabber vines are just spawning absolutely everywhere and the swarms of glyphids are stealing my closest enemy targetting guns.

I want to recommend this game but there is too much holding it back from a solid rogue-lite. The time constraints on runs is more annoying then challenging. Having to waste a run unlocking overclock abilities takes away from the progression flow.

In good rogue-lites you are capable of clearing to the end with what is given to you at base. Unlocks and rewards just accelerate your victory. In here it's almost impossible to get any edge on the swarm without grinding out a ton of unlocks for steady progression.

The rewards themselves are nothing to write home about either. Increase Damage. Increase Health. Increase Speed. Increase Reload. You are given base stat increases that do nothing to create interesting or notable builds. The most chaos you see on screen are the bugs that explode regardless of whatever weapons you're carrying. The only unique upgrades come from overclocks. Which are limited to 3 per weapon, and you will rarely get more then one weapon that far in your time limited run.

Runs are simple. Survive swarms, Find supply drop, Kill Elite. Once your Elite is dead, you have 30 seconds to leave and you lose all xp orbs you don't grab. Your runs now rely on you rushing for kills and xp gains. This in turn never makes you feel powerful. Only just barely scraping by the required damage threshold to get by the tougher stages. If you kill the Elite too fast you have no time to gain more xp.

One of the biggest highlights is the mining function. You can carve out parts of the map to get resources, escape swarms, or create killing funnels for bugs. This is by far the best feature of the game and I hope they expand on this.

All in all, its a barebones survivor-like with little repeatability outside of grinding for unlocks, which you will be doing a lot of. I hope they add more to it but I'm a little afraid this is just a small Survivor clone that will never go beyond anything besides its Deep Rock Galactic name.",1708130857,1708130857,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Perceived lack of enemy variety – it feels like all the creatures are either running towards you, exploding, spitting acid, or acting as turrets.
All three maps share the same end boss, which becomes a bit monotonous. Each map has five difficulties; I've only unlocked the first two, and the boss in those levels has only one move – a charge attack that is easily dodged, making the boss fight super easy.
Due to the uniform feel of the enemies, the maps also seem very similar. Despite different designs and effects, they lack diversity.

What I like:

The weapon and level-up system in the runs is enjoyable. The weapon evolutions and overclocks are cool.
The variety of weapons, classes, and overall build options is satisfying.
The game looks great for an auto-shooter, and the controls feel good.

What I would like to see:

A system where, during level-ups, in addition to rerolling choices, there's an option to block upgrades, removing them from the pool for that run.
Definitely more maps, and perhaps something to make them feel more distinct.
A clearer layout for the unlockables menu.

Regarding one aspect, I'm a bit uncertain. On one hand, it's a funny and valid strategy, but on the other hand, it feels a bit straightforward. Around 1/3 of the way through the stages, a supply drop occurs. You need to clear the landing zone and stand in it briefly; upon impact, it deals a significant amount of damage. It's so powerful that it one-taps the stage 1-4 elite bosses and brings the end boss down to half health. Therefore, for a min-max speedrun, it might be better to call the supply drop at the end to quickly kill or deal substantial damage to the boss.",1708130251,1708130251,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I wish the enemy was about 10% slower or something, and spawned slightly further away. This game uses large abysses that block progress in that direction and there are plateaus where you make a wrong turn and you're surrounded on all sides in a way that wouldn't happen in Vampire Survivors. Spawns coming from further offscreen and walking toward the player would allow people to e.g. turn and shoot them if they're playing the gunner.

There's the potential here to be rather unique in the setting, given the mining and so on. There are a bunch of currencies you can exchange or buy for the in game credits. This is really useful, but the developer hasn't actually put much thought into how they are to be used. Right now it's all the most bland tiny percentage increases imaginable.

If this game gets the polish it deserves, it should be quite good. Right now it's missing fairly essential features like banish or even out of match blocking so you don't get a particular option you hate.

2.  Double (or higher)ticks. Game allows enemies to multi-tick you for damage dependent on if they hit a corner or something an enemy (or BOSS) can hit you for 5 or 10+ damage, again, purely random but when you insta-die to a single hit from a boss with a high HP build...not exactly fun and not exactly something to encourage players to keep playing.

3. Just overall dumb decisions by the developers. Locking classes, locking builds, base upgrades coming out to 10-20% buffs and ONE level up surpassing it.

1. It's not fun. This game is difficult and stressful. Other ""survivors""-style games tend to have a nice flow between power fantasy and razor's edge success. They're fun but still challenging, making you want to try again and again. After 8 hours of gameplay and unlocks in this game, each run leaves me either feeling unfulfilled or frustrated.

2. Dives are too short for the progression path. A successful mission takes about 15 minutes to complete. While that is a great amount of time for this style of game, the entirety of that 15 minutes is spent desperately trying to stay ahead of the difficulty curve. By the time my upgrades and gear start feeling powerful, I'm already on the final boss and it's over.

3. Upgrades and weapons are bland. Perhaps I'm spoiled by this game's competition in the genre, but the weapons and upgrades available here feel lackluster. If this was an isometric ARPG, these weapons would feel right at home. As a ""survivors"" genre game, they're not very exciting. With few exceptions, you shoot bullets and throw grenades. 

4. The mining mechanic feels out of place. Each level takes place on an island which you will regularly skirt the edges of during normal gameplay. Throughout the levels are walls that you can mine to dig tunnels and find resources. This is a really neat feature, but I feel like it is implemented poorly, given the island level design. If levels were larger or even procedural, this mechanic would feel so much cooler than it currently does. You don't have time to plan and dig out a ""maze"" similar to a tower-defense game. Also, a surprising amount of the weapons are directional-based. If you're mining a wall, you're not facing monsters, and if you're not facing monsters, you're not attacking. 

Overall, the game is alright. It looks great, runs well, and has a gameplay loop you'd expect. Compared to its competitors in the ""survivors"" genre, I'd suggest you spend your money elsewhere. If those other games aren't hardcore enough for you, give this one a try, it might be what you're looking for.",1708124703,1708124703,True,269,14,0.78591454029083252,0,True,False,True

Pros:
No two runs are the same, progression system works really well.
Although it's a spin-off of the first, I think it could hold it's own.
Engi's power has no limits, THE TURRETS HAVE TREADS
Scout, although without most of the mobility from the original, still feels very mobile compared to other classes (Not to mention the dodge chance, it's saved me more times than I'd like to admit)
Gunner will send you to meet your maker as DPS incarnate.
Driller yet to be unlocked. Will test and report soon, although the wheel of elements in the trailer looks pretty good. (UPDATE: I have now unlocked Driller and the ""focus"" [unsure if that's the right word for this] on Elemental Damage gives a good unique feel to the class)
A lot of weapons no longer limited to a single class, now i can have my M1000 Classic and make the bugs eat lead with a machine gun too :D (UPDATE: I have discovered that not all guns have multi-class compatibility, my dream combo will never be found in-game. On the bright side, unlocking weapon types by unlocking sub-classes is very nice, and gives incentive for playing as more than just one class.)
Cons:
Scout just doesn't feel the same, the wheelchair is lost ;-;

The game is still in early access so what is here is fairly barebones, but im sure that will be a null issue in time. Gimmicks are pretty simple, with guns either shooting in a set direction depending on  the direction your player model is facing or spinning in circles. Early progression is currently kind of boring but it gets better once you start to unlock overclocks. Overclocks for now are still fairly simple, just changing damage types or some simple stats in a weapon but it can work. Some really cool things could be done over time with this time.

 It's fun, but because of the decently low amount of content in early access if you're not already a fan of DRG I'd say wait to buy the game.

Most important advice: Unlock overclocks FAST (get a weapon to lvl12).

The game is a fresh take on the survivor genra, the ""create your own path"" with the mining is a nice touch, and the fact that minerals force you to stay around places for a while is nice too.

I have some gripes with the game though:

1- l think the upgrades feel bland and meaningless (aside from the overclocks), and that is an issue. In Vampire Survivors, every weapon level does something, or at least its faster than once every 6 levels. 

2- Meta progression is VERY slow past the mid-game (dwarves level 15), as dwarves take ages to level up.

3- Unlocking new weapons is brought down by the fact that you will then have to roll them to check them, and then play a bland game with it to unlock the fun upgrades. Which is not desirable tbh, I don't see what this requirement does. Overclocks should be baseline unlocked, all this does is force you to play with an unfun weapon for a while, which is, of course, unfun.

4- Music is very lacking. Why isnt the swarm music ported here from the main game? Freewin if you ask me.

5- Reloads are very annoying very quick, and they only hinder the early game, as the reload upgrades quickly make it reload almost continuously. There needs to be some sort of secondary weapon that shoots when you have all weapons unlocked or something? Or just the ability to swing the pickaxe at the bugs like in main game or something. Being completely defenseless so often gets annoying fast.

At first, I had a lot of the same complaints as other reviewers here: I thought the game was too difficult, felt too slow, the weapons felt anemic, and the level design felt boring. I played through two runs and was about to call it quits and refund the game, but decided to give it a couple more tries. 

After progressing with my character and buying upgrades, and after really starting to understand how the upgrade system worked, everything started to change. I finished a run. I leveled up a couple weapons to their overcharge. I acquired new weapons and upgrades as my character leveled. I started to feel powerful.

Here is what I know from some limited play today and previous experience in the demo.

As an overall look, this game doesn't play like most other action-roguelite autobattler games, it doesn't seem to perform the usual twist or synergy weapon dynamics that most of this genre use to let the player go from struggle of ""barely holding them off"" to the fast and frantic ""armies die under my crazy magic fireball goose boots mwahaha!"".

This game is pretty much all uphill struggle. Sometimes you level up fast enough to feel like you're getting powerful, but it never lasts long.

BASICS:
You move with the WASD and/or arrow keys. Attacking is automatic when enemies are in range/line of sight. Digging is automatic as you press against rocks or resources, though I have noticed that sometimes it will stop if you don't keep pressing yourself into the thing that you are mining.

You spawn with a side objective such as ""mine morkite"", which is optional but rewards decently for completion, you should find resources and start mining everything available that you can until the boss spawns. Small minion-type bugs spawn frequently and wander toward you, your dwarf automatically attacks them, they die and drop XP orbs. Kill enough bugs to fill the bar on screen and the boss bug will spawn and come after you.

Bug spawn rate increases over time and you get more types appearing as well, especially as you hit the swarm timer milestones. If you take too long to kill the boss (a bit too busy mining are we?) all bugs get stronger, over and over again until you squish the big bad. Once the bossbug goes squish you get 30 seconds to escape to the drop pod amidst the remaining swarm, or it'll leave without you.

Once you reach the last level of the run there is a big boss to kill

PER-RUN PROGRESSION:
Collecting XP makes your per-run level go up, each level up gives you a choice of random upgrades and every so often you get to add another weapon to your arsenal. All weapons fire at the same time, each at their own pace and with independent aim and reload timings.

Some of the upgrades make your weapon(s) increase in level, and every so-many weapon levels you get to choose 1 of 2 random overclocks to add (if you have unlocked them for that weapon). Sadly sometimes these limited choices force you to change your weapon in a way you didn't want, but even an undesired choice brings its own benefits.

There are announced supply drop-pods which will provide unique per-run boosts such as gaining XP every time you take damage, and otherwise-unattainable benefits. These show up as a circular ping on the map if you are near the drop point. Upon reaching them you will need to A) clear all rocks and other fixed obstacles in the circle shown, and B) stay in the circle until the icon fills, which takes a few seconds. The drop pod will crush and push back nearby enemies, then just touch it to claim your free thingy.

Between levels you are afforded a chance to buy from a larger selection of upgrades using your gold and nitra (the red gold), as well as refill your health if you really need it. You can buy as many of these as you can afford and don't be afraid to reroll the remaining options if you have plenty of gold left.

META PROGRESSION (between runs):
As your class' meta/persistent level increases you gain access to more varied resources appearing in each run, and more weapons are unlocked to choose from when increasing your arsenal.

Meta progression is performed via the UPGRADE menu where you can improve different global stats such as overall reload speed, mining speed, critical hit chance and so on. These upgrades cost both credits and some of the unique resources you will find on your run, though you can also buy/sell resources within the upgrade menu if you have an abundance of one thing and not enough of another. The benefits provided from this menu are both diminishing and extremely expensive toward the top end. Definitely a feature in need of rebalance.

OTHER STUFF (notes):
The timer (it's a kill-counter) feels very tight at the start play, though no doubt that limit will become much easier to work with as meta progression is achieved.

Unfortunately at the start of a run it is rather easy to fall into a cycle where you are unable to damage the boss because there are too many minions in the way, and because you don't kill him fast enough all the aliens get stronger over and over, leading to more minions which just get harder and harder to kill. Don't hold off on killing the boss too long.

While supply pods are incredibly useful they can be positioned in really precarious places that get you killed, such as surrounded by A LOT of rock which you will probably die clearing if your guns can't hold back the swarm yet.

Take note that if you don't like the choices presented, most choice options in the game can be re-rolled (usually at the cost of a little gold) before you pick one.

Gold seems to be the king resource per-run as it is used for more things than Nitra.

Some of the best upgrades to focus on seem to be reload time (until you have a frequent stream of attacks going) and anything that will improve multiple weapons at once (sometimes you will miss the benefits of these if one or more of your weapons were forced into an elemental overclock, diverging your damage types). But don't overlook basic things like armour, move speed and dig speed too, especially if a rather large bonus pops up. It's not all about the guns....well okay its mostly about the guns.

Lastly, if you don't rock and stone....

[h1]What Does This Product Do?[/h1]
Upon starting the game, various trackers and geodata services by Unity Technologies are activated, collecting comprehensive data from players. The issue here is that customers are only informed about this behavior within the product itself, by then it's too late. Data is gone. There is also an opt-out option in the settings (thanks to my previous review of Deep Rock Galactic, the developers learned), but this feature is meaningless for the aforementioned reason and users are still tracked with disabled ingame placebo options!

[h1]Who Operates the Product?[/h1]
Ghost Ship Publishing

Ghost Ship Publishing is a subsidiary of Ghost Ship Games and was founded in 2023. The company is part of the Embracer Group.

The settings indicate that analytics for automation and core business metrics as well as performance measurements are enabled. User tracking is not restricted, and the player has not opted out of tracking (the player doesn't even get to know about it!). It waits up to 60 seconds for user information.

Users should note that these settings are almost universally active in every product with the Unity engine, without users knowing about it, let alone consenting to this data collection. In short, user consent to data collection is akin to data theft, self-legitimized by Unity Technologies.

The core metrics can be deactivated by developers based on the Unity license, but very few do so.

This raises questions about transparency and user consent, as well as the possibility of identification based on collected data, especially since these data are collected prior to in-game consent. An opt-out option in the settings is therefore meaningless.

Have you ever wanted to play more games in the Deep Rock Galactic Cinematic Universe (DRGCU)?  No?  Well, what if we just reused the voicelines, sound effects and sound track from that game and slapped a topdown view of it?  Are you interested then?

This game only really appeals if you're already a fan of Deep Rock.  I am, I've played hundreds of hours, it's great!  But this feels like a half-baked cash grab, admittedly only after a few hours.  Ignoring the difficulty being cranked way too high on launch, but it never feels like you're winning.  There's no moments of reprieve, and the weapons aren't satisfying.  So far, it's all bullets all the time.  Sometimes the bullets have electrical or cold effects to them, but they're bullets all the same.

Deep Rock Galactic Survivor doesn't hook you in with the promise that the content you haven't seen is fun, and keeps new characters and levels timewalled.  It's literally the same grind as in Deep Rock, except they were foolish enough to think grinding solo survivor games would be a pleasant experience.  You're never excited about the new gun you've unlocked or new character, and the zones just steadily get more annoying than interesting, so progression is simply a frustrating experience.

I played Deep Rock originally in one of the early access periods when it was a not great game, so I'm optimistic, but I truly just expect this game to continue to be a stinker and fade into obscurity in a few years.  There's nothing new here, and it's more expensive - go play another survivors game that's more fun and cheaper.",1708116649,1708116649,False,5,0,0.538077414035797119,0,True,False,True

++ Interesting new playstyle with using the terrain to your advantage
++ 4 Different playable Characters with different playstyles
++ almost all DRG weapons + many weapons that are totally new in DRG-universe
+ some very interesting overclocks
+ rewarding moments for getting great upgrades/overclock

Neutral (not great but also not bad)
* 3 total Biomes (more than i expected for the early state of the game)
* Progression could be a bit faster, but its okay

[h3] Cons [h/3] (written 2 days after early-access release 02/16/2024 - maybe changed since then)
- not that much variety in builds, most upgrades are flat stat changes (just the upgrades on lvl up, overclocks excluded)

Unlike every other of this kind of games, DRG:S forces you to objectives and being mindful of your surroundings since enemies will overwhelm you in little time if you focus on something for more than a couple seconds while ignoring danger. The RNG is not stupidly against you and you will have to mine resources in order to get them between stages. Honestly, at first I had a hard time but going with the flow of the game it turns out to be quite fun.
The amount of upgrades is not very big but grindy over the time, which resembles the upgrading system on DRG perks and weapons. Speaking of weaponry, one thing that surprises is them being attached to drawves' levels for unlocking and then being available to any run you do. It is kind of hilarious an engineer with a minigun and a sludge gun.
My only complain is the art direction. Why would they go for a ""smooth"" modeling on the characters instead of the sharp polygonal of the original game is beyond me. Feels out of place, although in the game the camera is so far that it matters not.

I will say the demo seemed much more fun and less of a chore, but there were a lot less options to work with in the demo. If the team involved with this game are from the main Deep Rock Galactic, I have no doubt they will consistently improve and add new and exciting things. As of now, you can definitely feel the early access. Most of my issues are small things that can be improved, and some are just odd. For instance, the Tinkerer class mod starts with a terrible weapon, a front-firing shotgun that doesn't really aim the way you are facing and shoots off to the sides of enemies you are directly looking at. However, on another playthrough, I added plasma as the first overclock, and then a shoot behind overclock and easily beat the dive. I think that's a big part of the problem with the fun factor. Some of the weapons are pretty terrible unless you get a decent overclock, and some combos will just kill you. There was a mission with the Juggernaut class where I just couldn't kill the end bug, because I couldn't clear the horde with his dinky pistol and a badly selected grenade, so they just kept evolving. A few other times, I've had to leave a mission with single digit gold and nitra, which felt wrong. Some weapons and combos I'll play and wonder if they were actually play-tested. I also have to agree with people about the timers. It feels you are penalized for doing well, because the mission just advances quicker and you have less time to get the minimum resources for a few simple upgrades. In a strange sort of way though, all these little issues make it even more satisfying when you get the right combos and annihilate a dive. The game also needs some different final level and regular level objectives. These same deadnought hunts will get old after enough runs. I haven't gone past Hazard 3 yet on any level, so I'm not sure how it'll ramp up by then, but for now the game is definitely worth the price, despite having plenty of room to improve.",1708112580,1708112580,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

DRG: Survivor is a ""Bullet Heaven"" style game in that you control your characters movements and positioning, they handle the shooting. (Think Vampire Survivors)

This game is different than the other survivor games in that it's a much shorter experience. You go through five levels culminating in killing a boss. Each level is about 2 minutes, you then need to hustle to your getaway vehicle or get left behind. What makes this game different is that you're less powerful here than in other bullet heaven games. While you get stronger, the need for careful positioning never goes away. There is also the mining aspect of the game which is probably the strongest addition. Carving out safe pockets into walls can allow you to create kill corridors, or to escape being cornered. There are also rare minerals to discover.

So far I've been enjoying the flow of the game. On the first level you actually get better experience from mining than fighting while on the last level you're focusing on mowing down hordes of bugs while nimbly maneuvering around them and the boss.

As of now, and in Early Access, the game content is a bit thin, but it's enough to justify the $10 price.",1708112346,1708112346,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I want to recommend this game, but right now it is lacking in content, weapon variety, enemy variety, and meaningful perk options. For the price this game is at ($9 on launch week, $10 afterwards) for this genre, there is a shockingly little amount of content. This game does offer some fun for sure, but the fun [i] quickly [/i] faded for me after 6 hours. I will be drawing a lot of similarities and points to the more well known game of this genre - [b] Vampire Survivors [/b] , which people are [i] probably [/i] tired of hearing about when it comes to reverse bullet hell roguelikes.

[h2] The good stuff [/h2]
- I do like the mining mechanic, it feels true to Deep Rock and allows for interesting terrain manipulation at time to funnel enemies at certain points, making a good run shred through hordes of bugs squeezing through a choke point. However, when mining minerals this can be tediously slow to the point where it can potentially end runs due to the default speed of mining. Even with the passive upgrade halfway to being maxed out, it still feels very slow. I would like to see the passive upgrade buffed or the default mining speed raised just a little bit.
- Non gun weapons, like the flame grenade, bullet grenade, ice grenade etc feel unique and fun to build for. I had a run that had the ice grenade with the bullet grenade, and that run was the most fun I had in this game in the near 7 hours I have played. Freezing an entire horde, then throwing a grenade that split into 3 smaller grenades that shoot a fan of bullets at high speed did put a smile on my face. The turret also gets an exception for the ""non gun weapon rule"" because it involves at least [i] some [/i] interactivity from the player even if it is just standing still for 0.5 seconds to put them down faster. The turrets have unique overclocks compared to other weapon options.
- Some overclocks are well designed and offer a huge boost in power and visual variety when it comes to non gun type weapons, i.e the grenades and turret. Most of them are just general stat increases, but some of them can really change how a weapon feels and can make a weapon go from zero to hero. For most weapons however, they are not exciting as a lot of them are ""gain X% damage and lose X% reload / fire rate"" compared to having a grenade that splits into 3 smaller grenades that shoot a rotating fan of bullets. I would like to see more unique ones for most guns in this game.
- Classes feel unique, I like the idea of having the 4 dwarves have different ""subclasses"" as it were, giving them a different starting weapon and passive trait. The difference in what each character offers feels true to DRG and I hope this gets expanded upon in the future. 

[h2] The not so good stuff [/h2]
- Enemy variety is insanely limited and very boring. You will find yourself fighting the same 3 to 4 enemies the entire time while playing this game. Every enemy is pretty much the same braindead grunt but scaled up to have a bigger model and health pool. Detonators are very annoying as they become one of the more common enemies in higher difficulties and can wipe you almost instantly.
- Stage variety is non existent. There are only 3 stages right now, but each stage you unlock will contain the same type of enemies you have been fighting since the very first stage. There are no unique stage events to break up the monotony either. Each stage pretty much follows the same pattern of ""kill enemies, claim supply pod for artifact, kill elite"" then move on. There is no variety for the final boss either. You will fight the same Dreadnought at the end of each stage with the same stage progression each and every time.
- The passive upgrades are very boring and offer marginal stat increases. There are no unique passives compared to Vampire Survivors which has so many options like banishing an item or perk from showing up for the rest of the run. It is all just ""gain X movement speed, gain X armor, X health"" etc. I would like to see more unique options and some consolidated. I think movement speed, mining speed and MAYBE reload speed should be condensed into one passive labeled under ""player action speed"" or something to make room for more interesting options like a banish, cheaper costs for buying / rerolling, a free revive or buffs for BOSCO. You could make BOSCO have a special animation to revive you with the flask with the revive passive or something like that if you want to make it even more faithful to DRG.
- Weapon variety is insanely boring when it comes to most weapons in this game. Most of them are generic guns that shoot bullets, with the overclocks for these guns not being so much better, as those are also just general stat increases for most guns. Some guns have interesting overclocks when you unlock the more unique weapons, but for most bullet based guns, they are basically just juiced up level up perks.
- Stages move WAY too fast. No matter what, the stage will always progress and you cannot do anything to slow yourself down to give you time to collect all the XP you left lying around or to do the side objective. You may become so strong so early that you will progress the stage too fast that you do not have time to run around collecting everything, shred the boss faster than expected, then the Drop Pod comes and you have 30 seconds remaining to do whatever you want to do before you are forced to leave. You may progress so fast that you are short on some upgrades for the final stage making it more difficult than it has to be. I would like to see extraction time raised up to one minute to give me a little bit more time to do the side objective or have enough time to be safe enough to enter the drop pod, as you can be swarmed very fast during these 30 seconds making it much harder to get to the drop pod. 
- Enemies have an insane amount of health and I wish there was some way to tell how much health an enemy had that is not an elite / boss. These big numbers mean nothing to me when I do not even know how much health something has to begin with and what the scaling numbers are like.
- After you get each passive to about halfway, it becomes VERY slow to keep upgrading as you gain very small amounts of materials, and they keep becoming more expensive. It almost feels like the main point of this game is to get all upgrades maxed out and then stop.
For my smaller complaints : pickup radius feels too small at base and the upgrades feel like they do not change anything nearly at all unless you grab so many of the level upgrades on them. It feels like I gain too little nitra. The common level upgrades could use a buff (2% movement speed is laughably bad, common should be 5% at base with the rest being the same, this is just one example of useless common upgrades). 

Overall, I would not recommend this game if you are looking for another meaty reverse bullet hell roguelike. You can get Vampire Survivors with all its DLC for less than what this game costs and get way more playtime. 6 hours in VS felt like I was not even scratching the surface let alone started digging. In 6 hours of DRG Survivor, I felt like I have seen most of what this game has to offer in terms of replay value. I hope there are balance changes and overhauls to a lot of this game across the board. I do not hate this game, but when you compare this to other games of this genre, it offers very little. It will probably be fun for about 15 to 20 hours, but after that, you will not see anything really new and have some sort of endless progression that Vampire Survivors has where you can infinitely upgrade any character you want with Golden Eggs. Once you get all the upgrades, it sort of just stops. It would have been nice to have an endless mode. For $10 at default, it is fine, but nothing extraordinary.",1708088653,1708111406,False,3,1,0.430875569581985474,0,True,False,True

After roughly 20 hours and 20 different Bullet Hell/Heavens I can safely say this one tops most of it's genre so far. Still seems very Early Access, so the potential for it turning insanely good OR bad is there.

Meta progression can be a bit grindy, but it took me from dying to the boss to near instant melting him with any class once acquired.

You don't just survive the waves, you have to make it back to the pod before it leaves you, which has a random drop location. Being able to kite the enemies with mining makes it more interesting, literally held back aliens like a Spartan in the Hot Gates. Trying to loop back to the safety of the drop pod end of wave is quite interesting at times.

Level design so far is awesome, each map bringing new elements like lava rocks burning you or growing brambles that get in the way as you try to escape doom. Characters have different mods to earn switching up how you normally play that class, sort of like God of Weapons or Soulstone. This game brings a nice pace of diversity for how early in development it's at.
 I seriously look forward to seeing how they choose to enhance this game further.

6/10 for now, but I have a feeling they get it right during EA.
I'm gonna give some categories here for more info:

The best parts of the game:
1. Mining
- Nice mixing of gathering resources for the current run, as well as the meta progression
2. Voice Acting/Sound desing
- Really well done, endearing and often funny
- Weapons could use a bit more oomph though
 3. Performance
- So far so good on my main PC as well as the Steamdeck (a solid game for the deck btw)
4. Art-style
- Looks really nice and pleasant, everything is readable and understandable - from enemy or resource types

As for the meh category:
1. Weapons
- Some balancing is required, as there are weapons that I'll never pick for their lack of damage or utility
- Overall a good variety with some weapons feeling better at CC, single target or AOE.
2. Enemy variety
- This game feels more skill reliant than other VS inspired games, some more variety would help.
3. Hitboxes
- Mostly good, but sometimes you take damage from an enemy while there's visible space between the models
4. Characters
- There isn't much difference between them, other than the starting weapon. I'd rather have 1 character with a starter weapon choice, than the current implementation
- I do love their distinct personalities though!

And now the bad - needs attention ASAP:
1. Overclocks
- Extremely boring stuff like 80% of the time. 25% damage + 25% reload speed? really?
- Would really benefit from more unique choices, like the Spiral fire on some guns. Give us multishot, every 4th shot pulls enemies together, shots explode at the end of their lifespan, anything more interesting than 2 levels worth of numbers
2. Meta-progression
- Currently so weak and boring, I don't even feel it. It takes a long time to unlock stuff, and with the difficulty constantly rising (unless you want to only play only hazard 1/2), no progression is felt
- Maybe add 1 choosable overclock per weapon to apply by default, which can be swapped in the main menu?
3. Difficulty
- Right now, the only and best strategy is to wait for exploding bugs, and detonate them. That's it.
- Any elemental build feels the same (except cold, cuz frozen bugs don't explode, so... Lower damage), and the kinetics aren't much better.
- Since the player is so weak, I'll never choose a ""Mining speed"" or ""Movement speed"" utility upgrades, because my lack of damage would get me killed.
- I want to feel rewarded for making smart decisions on level up - Swapping elements to fit together, or avoiding it to stay kinetic.
- Maybe elementals should proc status effects more often (and stronger), but be unable to crit - leave that to kinetics as their nieche?

Overall, I'm leaving this installed on my deck and waiting for future updates.

Firstly let me give you some positives,
- The game runs smoothly
- visual effects are nice
- the overall graphics is pleasing to the eye
- ""terraforming"" in survival game is cool idea.

Now I must get to the unpleasant part.
- The biggest survival game element (getting stronger) is completely missing. You just slightly boost your damage in a way that makes You get trough next round.
- There are very little unique powerups. Mostly you get fire rate, crit chance and damage. Most special thing I found would be overclock changing damage lement which is not much.
- Staying longer in a round to get some power only punishes you by spawning more bugs with more HP. 
- upgare currencies are very scares. You have to mine nitra and gold but rarely do You have time to do that resulting in you just looking at upgrades (the same you get from levelup) which You can't afford.",1707925046,1708109644,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

 [*] It is DRG
 [*] The tunnelling mechanic adds something new which does make the levels a bit more interesting
 [*] It is quite pretty for this type of game

That is honestly about it

Now for the cons:
 [*] Progression is very boring
 [*] I have unlocked 3 of the 4 classes so far and 2 of them are really bad
 [*] Enemy variety is poor
 [*] Stage variety is poor
 [*] Upgrades are extremely boring

Let me flesh out a few of the above points. The game is designed so that you are constantly on the move, this leads to enemies spending most of the level behind you. The Gunner' main weapon only shoots forward making it pointless of most of the map. The Engineer is reliant on turrets that are only placed when you stand still for a few seconds, in a game where you need to be on the move constantly, this is bad design.

One of the things that made DRG so compelling was the random nature of the maps, that is not seen here, there are 3 or 4 different variations and that is all. 

Upgrades are extremely mundane, you can add electricity, lightning, cold etc to weapons. Wow, so original. Nothing like VS where upgrades can entirely change how a weapon works. 

All in all this is a poor example of this genre that is relying on peoples love of DRG to carry it. Hopefully changes and improvements are made throughout EA.

It runs very smooth on the deck and so far I have not found any bugs, lags or crashes.

For anyone complainig that there is no save inbetween the stages,the same goes for almost all rougelikes/lites like Risk of Rain 2, Hades, Vampire Survivor.

DRGS works similar like VS but for me personally it is a bit more challenging, which is good and I like that you can actually farm the resources you need to level up.
I love both games, but I really love the challenge aspect of this one. 
People who saying it is repetitive and boring, yeah this type of game is not for everyone and it is still in EA so we don't know what will be added in the future.

Pros:
- it's fun.
- looks good.
- Plays well on steamdeck.

There are some issues that I hope will be fleshed out over time.

Cons:
- Some of the weapons are annoying to use.
- When you ""win"" a level you get 30 seconds to get to the dropship. It's really quick, doesn't feel great. I think it should be doubled.
- Very repetitive at the moment. Missing some of the other bugs from DRG. No real boss variation.

There is massive potential for this game to be one of the best survivor-likes out there but right now, at least, they aren't capitalizing on that potential.

Weapons feel kind of underwhelming and there isn't much in the way of synergy like you'd normally see in games like this. Where other games change the properties of weapons or add proc chains, etc., , most of the upgrades here are for damage and reload speed... which is okay and necessary but doesn't add to the feeling of becoming overpowered like you'd want from a game like this. Weapons with a large AOE seem to be super strong, as single target weapons just don't deal enough damage to feel like they are worth picking up. I can imagine so many interesting mechanics and combos off the top of my head that it seems odd to me that the devs of one of my favorite games of all time (DRG) wouldn't add more of that kind of stuff in.

Classes don't feel varied enough in my opinion. They all kinda do the same thing, outside of driller which seems to be the strongest as he can dig through the terrain better than other classes. Gunner can barely use his chain gun since you have to be looking at enemies for it to fire, which is super awkward in a game like this where you can only look in the direction you are moving. Classes need to feel unique... otherwise why have different classes at all? Most of them are a few upgrades away from basically being the same dwarf.

Meta progression is slow and underwhelming... I mean yeah its helpful to do more damage and get more XP but where's the fun stuff?? We need a reason for the grind to be worth it.

Why am I forced to mine loot bugs? They block shots and make for unnecessary obstacles in the horde.

All this being said, I still like the game a lot and see a bright future for it. Maybe wait for the game to live through early access a bit before snagging... but I do expect there to be massive changes as the game gets updated",1708102790,1708102790,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

  As always I recommend you watch some gameplay videos before buying to see if you'll like the game loop.

It has all the soul of DRG, with the weapons and elements you would expect from it. The soul of each class is honored and explored so well here. There is a lot of depth to the variants of each class, definitely experiment as you go because it's not obvious how it works.

To people struggling with difficulty, prioritize weapon level over just about anything else. 

There's one big flaw with progression as I see it, you have to get a weapon to level 12 before you can unlock overclocks IN THE NEXT DIVE. So, if you play for the first time with your new weapons, you get no overclocks which see to me to be the best way to increase DPS. This is a big flaw and honestly should just be removed from the game. You unlock a new weapon and if you take it, it's ltierally a massive disadvantage because no overclocks...

I amongst many people, since the genre is very popular nowadays, really enjoy the Action Roguelike genre. I first started playing this type of bullet hell, action roguelike, auto-shooter type of games with Vampire Survivors, but since then bought and played a bunch of them, but from all of them Brotato is still my favorite.
I’m a big fan of the Deep Rock Galatic game, played it a bunch with my friends and also solo, so buying this Action Roguelike spin off was a no brainer, specially at such a low price.
What to say about DRG: Survivor? Even in Early Release it’s already a pretty fun game. Yes it is not that different from the other games in the genre but it has an identity of its own that also sets it apart from the rest. For instance, the digging for minerals (makes sense since this is a Deep Rock Galactic game) adds a layer of complexity to the gameplay. Should I dig more here? Should I scan for gold, etc and risk not getting enough XP, etc, etc.

The game is pretty fun, it triggers that part of my brain that loves mining, combined with killing bugs, what’s not to love? The gun variety is also pretty good for an Early Release game. My only minor complaint is that apart from the Scout, the other classes are a bit too slow, I think the base moving speed should be increased a bit.
The performance is pretty good, runs flawlessly on the Steam Deck too, which is a big plus for this type of games since they are a match made in heaven for the Steam Deck.

In contrast to other roguelite titles where early-game luck can lead to the acquisition of formidable builds, this game relies heavily on progression unlocking, diminishing the excitement of varied game play experiences. Consequently, the game play experience feels somewhat repetitive, requiring extensive grinding before substantial advancements can be made.

I never would have guessed the survival style could be mixed with DRG but here we are. The mechanics are essentially all there and it makes me want to go play actual DRG.

The Dwarf:
Rock and Stone, for Carl.

The Unfortunate:
I thought I would have loved a single player DRG experience, unfortunately due to how good this feels as a DRG style game with super close feeling to the original... it makes me feel alone without my dwarf brothers (and possibly sisters, you can't tell through the beards...). The lack of multiplayer is a double edged sword in that regard. So, plus: single player. Negative: it's single player.

The bad: the camera gets a bit twitchy for some reason, not sure why and it can be a distracting/immersion breaking for me. Seems to get better when you stand still for a second, but often returns when things get intense. Hopefully they fix it down the line.

DRG: Survivor is a unique game in the genre considering the mining feature. In procedurally generated runs, your goal is not only to complete objectives but also to explore the environment to find ore veins to unlock meta-progression upgrades and get access to certain upgrade-related features. The game plays great, and it has an addictive nature. Although that is the case, [b]I found the overall design of DRG: Survivor lacking many features that would make the game great.[/b]

[b]First of all, I want to mention that it is not so possible to reach a power level that would satisfy your ""power fantasy"" needs.[/b] In bullet heaven games and the likes of them, I'd expect to be able to be rewarded as I choose correct upgrades, utilize randomness manipulation to optimize the rarities of random drafts, create weapons synergies, and in the end, after all that hard work, become so powerful that no single enemy can stand in my way. In DRG: Survivor, enemies' and your power levels are mostly the same, and it is not so possible to exceed their strength to overwhelm swarms even if you create an optimized build.

When it comes to upgrades in the game, they feel bland. I would expect there to be a variety of upgrades that would affect the way you approach runs, but that, unfortunately, is not the case. Every single upgrade in the game is a flat stat boost, and the only difference between them is their rarities that change their effectiveness. In between sections of a run, you are provided with a shop-like interface to get more upgrades, but they are of the same kind as the level-up upgrades. [b]I found both the variety and effectiveness of upgrades in DRG: Survivor lacking.[/b]

On top of upgrades that come as leveling rewards and from shops, you reach certain ""milestones"" for your weapons during the runs as you get upgrades that increase the capabilities of those weapons. As you reach the milestones, you get additional, more powerful upgrades. Although these upgrades are different from generic upgrades, they still do not feel unique. These upgrades either change the element of a weapon, make it deal piercing damage, or change the stats of the weapon drastically. [b]The more powerful upgrades in the game, as other generic upgrades, leak excitement too.[/b]

[b]Meta-progression in DRG: Survivor comes in two ways.[/b] The first is related to spending specific ores to upgrade your stats, and the second one is about new characters and weapons.

As you progress in runs, you mine unique ore veins that reward you with various ores that are used to upgrade your characters' stats across all runs. Although the system is great, the upgrades offered in this system are the same as in-run upgrades, and [b]the first type of meta-progression in the game creates just a separate layer of grinding rather than providing meaningful gameplay.[/b]

When it comes to new characters and weapons, I can say that changing the starting conditions for each run is good, but that is pretty much it. The biggest problem with weapons in the game is that they don't particularly feel great, and they don't synergize properly with other weapons. [b]I found the second type of meta-progression in the game to not add a lot to the gameplay but just expand the game with some additional grinding process.[/b]

In summary, I went into DRG: Survivor with great expectations, but left it with disappointment. [b]It is hard to suggest DRG: Survivor to anyone[/b] considering its systems not being exciting and its price not being in line with the content it provides.",1708093793,1708093808,False,11,0,0.573596835136413574,0,True,False,True

- Graphics are good! Effects are balanced, it doesn't drown in special effects like other games.
- Gameplay is very fun and polished!

- Permanent upgrades and unlockables.
- The Deep Rock Galactic theme fits this game style quite well.

exiceted to see how it goona look on release 
below i write my opinion on what need to be added in future updates
1. first comes to mind are new maps some winter, sand, etc biomes 
(for me a little bit strange that biomes dont effect you build for example in volcanic fire map enemy do not resist fire and cant walk in lava im not saying that is nessisary but maybe for some realistic hardcore mode it would be nice) 
2. weapons  
atm game has many of them but after hours of play you choses become the same 
3. enemy 
the liitle ones dont matter to much you just wipe them and dont pay attention but bosses specialy the last one become boring soon
4. new classes 
i write it last because for me its less important than other things and i think at this moment 4 classes in game is fine but if game grows some new uniq classes need to be added 
5. steam achievments
because i love them and 19 is not even close to be enough for this game

For everybody else: Vampire Survivors is still the status quo, at least as far as I heard (this game here is my first autoshooter). DRG Survivor does have its perks and it's a lot of fun, but it's still early access. The game starts slow and almost dull, but once you unlocked the other dwarfs and some upgrades it becomes challenging and quite fun.

1.The meta progression is basically non-existant: finishing a dive and then being rewarded with the ability to buy a damage increase of 4% or a movement speed of 2% does not feel significant at all compared to other games in the genre. The game requires a lot more variation in the meta upgrade choices or a new system of cool perks (example: every X kills you emit a pulse that knocks back the enemies or a % chance that elemental damage will spread to nearby enemies).

2.Difficulty: the developers are proud of the fact that hazard 1 is meant to crush you at the start. The level up upgrades are very generic and barelly make you feel stronger. From the start to the end the bugs feel stronger than you. 

3.Overclock unlocks: in order to unlock the overclocks for a weapon you need to upgrade it to level 12, but you are only allowed to choose the overclocks for it starting from the next dive. This means players are encouraged to let the bugs kill them as soon as the weapon gets to level 12. I beat hazard 1 with driller with no overclocks and it wasn't fun. Every single class should have a starting weapon that has overclocks already unlocked. Also, getting unlucky and finishing a run with a level 11 weapon gives you no reward and you have to start again.

4.Extraction timer: as soon as you kill the elite at the end of a stage you have 30 seconds to escape, which isn't enough to do anything else but run to the drop pod. This means you are encouraged to pick weapons with bad single target damage so you can avoid the bosses in order to get minerals. Yes, a roguelike where you are punished for having a strong build.

I will also give some suggestions to fix those problems:
1.Create new meta upgrades: bosco auto-revives, one extra bullet penetration, bonus % damage against enemies affected by elemental effects, a few free perk rerolls, chance for extra choice at level up, % change to double the value of any mineral chunk you receive

2.Hazard 1 is meant to teach you the game not discourage new players. Make hazard 1 easy and give it low mineral rewards and scale the rewards and exp with hazard level just like DRG (for example, Haz 5 in DRG multiplies all minerals, credits and XP by x2,33). It also feels humiliating and demoralizing to constantly die in Hazard 1.

3.I would personally tie the overclock upgrades to a certain ammount of damage dealt by that weapon. For example, the rank 6 overclock can unlock at 500k damage, rank 12 at 2 million and rank 18 at 5 million total damage dealt with that weapon. You would also receive an overclock in the middle of a dive if the damage requirement is reached so you are encouraged to use and upgrade all your weapons.

4.When the elite dies the game should spawn endless swarms that get harder and harder each second and you should have the ability to call the drop pod whenever you want. This way you are rewarded for having a strong build by being able to spend some more time collecting minerals. As a trade-off, the enemies could stop dropping XP after the elite dies.",1708080831,1708080831,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,True

Classes don't mean shit anymore. They are basically the same with a few minor differences like slightly more damage. 

No manual aim. Seeing some exploders in the middle of a huge mob? Too bad, must cut through the mob first before your dwarf starts shooting the exploder. By the time your dwarf FINALLY targets the exploder, most of the small mobs are already dead.

Overall, you always feel weak, slow and vulnerable. There should be a point where you become the danger.

Hades, as of now, is a MUCH better game. This game just makes me tired. It's still in early access and has a ton of potential. Hopefully they'll fill out this game with a ton of content, as it stands now, there are much better games.

There's little sense of a meaningful progression within runs and the build up in power isn't significant. At hazard 1, level 1 it takes nearly as long to eliminate enemies as it does when  at hazard 3, level 3 w/ upgrades. The choices between upgrades feel insubstantial and while there is some variety in the weaponry, it never coheres into a strategic set of choices with the upgrade system.  Given the lack of variety within the actual levels or enemies themselves, this leads to each run feeling flat and there isn't a wide range of options for the player that creates unique combinations.

While there are some interesting strategies surrounding the use of mining to kite enemies, at later hazard levels, some of these strategies start to feel mandatory and repetitive. For instance, at higher hazard levels, it feels necessary to use the supply drop to finish off bosses since it's nearly impossible for standard weaponry to have enough raw power. Certain classes are particularly trapped into this strategy.

The meta progression also feels off and unsatisfying. Needing to first level a weapon to 12 to unlock overclocks can be frustrating since doing this once can lead to a run ending and it's unclear why this mechanic is in the game beyond extending play time arbitrarily. The use of resources for meta progression v. run progression does create interesting tension. However, the actual meta progression upgrades are modest and do not have a strong bearing on choices within runs. I would prefer to see a different mechanic like the perk system used in Deep Rock Galactic or a skill tree with slottable unlocks, similar to a game like tiny rogues. It would also be more niceto use the meta progression to change up Bosco or modify the player's starting equipment.

At the least, the game needs to be punchier, with more variety and objectives within runs. Additional intersting procedural generation within the environment would make the game more engaging, as would more compelling enemy types. The relics could also use a rework - many of them feel situational and the starting set seems to rely on self-damaging (which could make some sense if starting players are taking a lot of damage but the starting set of options are not fun relics to play with).

The actual mining mechanics are neat and pathing the enemies is a really coolfeature. I hope the devs build on this base and find a sense of progression within runs & meta that leads to a more satisfying growth curve, with much wider diversity in builds and meaningful player choices beyond stat upgrades.",1708070993,1708071248,False,5,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,True

I'd recommend letting the game cook a bit before jumping into it if you're on the fence. I feel like the majority of positive reviews for this game are just because it's Deeprock Galactic...

-Progression is simple and pretty boring.
-Weapons and upgrades are repetitive and boring.
-The whole Overclocking/Level 12 weapon thing is again, kind of boring.
-The levels are all the same and... yeah boring.
-The first two classes are terrible compared to the last two and you have to spend a lot of time with these to unlock them.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

+ its DRG through and through, the theme fits very well and the devs cleverly used all main staples of the game, like the loot bugs or the mining

+ although I dont recommend it in the early access as of now, I think it is one of the more interesting Danmaku games, because of the theme and gameplay idea

+ the mining mechanic is great, you dont only mine to gather minerals, but to carefully carve paths and get around a huge wave of bugs, which is a cool idea

+ simple controls, only move, auto aim

+ the visuals are very nice


[h1]Cons:[/h1]

- Its too hard. There is no way around it, the balance seems way off. I couldnt finish the first map in Hazard 1, which feels bad, when there are 3 maps with multiple difficulties up to 3. Each one getting harder and harder.

- Its one of those games were your meta progression is the only way to progress. No matter what your skill is, the game will make you lose, if you havent unlocked more stuff.....I dont like it.

- Upgrades during gameplay feel like you didnt upgrade anything at all, which for a Danmaku game is one of the worst things to do in my opinion. Its all about stats, like 10% more this or that, but you cant make that out in the gameplay. Its worse, that I have the feeling to always feel weak or underpowered, no matter what.

- I dont like the reload mechanic. Its nothing but another stat that you absolutely need to upgrade.

- Weapons feel weak and are mechanically not that great. I know they tried to implement the guns from DRG of course, but it makes for some uninspired gameplay and boring upgrades.

- The Gunner is the worst character in my opinion, as he needs to look at creatures to shoot them....In a game where you have to be constantly on the move and basically run away with auto aiming shots behind you....the Gunner does not work for me. Even if some people get this build to work, its the one I have the least fun playing.

- Some weapons did not work for me balance wise. You can get a gun that shoots in 4 directions, but enemies are 90% behind you, making the 4 way spread useless. This gun doesnt even auto aim, which makes it almost useless.

- Its one of those games, where I wish it was a twin stick shooter instead. The auto aim can screw you over. You want to kill the mini boss at last, but your low rate high powered shot aims at a smaller bug that crawls infront of that boss.....

- You have no map and I lost rounds due to fleeing from the bugs, only to end up in a dead end, not being able to get out. If I knew there was a dead end, I would go in that direction with the huge swarm behind me, but there is no way of telling.

- You get a mission that can be accomplished for extra gold and loot, but some are way off in terms of balance. Collect 6 flowers...okay....but collect 12 Boolo Caps.....thats often times way too much and it cant be completed. Same with Morkit, it takes the longest to mine and you need too much quantity.

- The timer is too fast. You get a new ""quest"" and all of a sudden a swarm. If you take your time on a boss, the game will simply make the swarm deadlier, which seems kinda unfair and makes no sense in the worlds logic. Why are the bugs getting harder to kill after some time? 

Its not a bad game overall, it just needs more balancing updates. I can see myself playing this more than any other Danmaku game in the future. But right now, its too hard to enjoy.",1708068235,1708068705,False,6,0,0.479029297828674316,0,True,False,True

It is a pretty simple survivor game, no complex combination to learn or secrets to uncover in a large map. What it brings though is digging and that brings challenge, risk and reward. 

You need to dig to get resources to upgrade the current run but also the small permanent bonuses, enemies only gives experience for the current run. Do you risk digging and get cornered, hoping you will be able to dig through fast enough to escape? Digging allow you to make your own map and play your own way instead of moving around in circle or even staying in place killing everything with no effort like you can end up doing in some survivor games. You can dig a hole and force the enemies in a chokepoint or dig as much as possible to have a large area to move around in. It all depends on what weapons you end up with.

Currently there are only 4 classes, like the original game, and they only have 3 different kits each, beside the starting weapon most of the kits bring only a small difference once you unlocked most weapons for everyone. For example, the Engineer starting kit brings turrets and seems to have a high chance to have other ""deployables"" as a second weapon but once unlocked anyone could get the turrets as a second weapon. Some of the kits have passive though, like the digger first kit that allow you to mine faster the more you mine without stopping. Other characters can get faster mining with level up bonuses but his passive is a bit more unique.

Overall it's a fun survivor game that brings some unique mechanics but you'll quickly run out of content right now and it is a bit repetitive, there are only a few different missions and the fifth ""round"", the last of a run, seems to always be the same. At the current price it's a no brainer if you enjoy survivor games and wants more. There are better games and with more content but this one is a little special if you've been a fan of Deep Rock and dwarves since the original game. If the developer show this one the same love and support as the main game it could turn into a solid contender to the genre.

- The meta progression is unrewarding and slow.
- Many upgrades are excruciatingly pitiful tiny stat buffs (e.g +4% speed, +10% fire rate). That is never fun and mostly relies on RNG.

You have menu bugs which aren't game breaking but very intrusive such as when you level up and die or finish the level before the upgrades show up then they never go away unless you restart. The absolute worst and easy to trigger bug is in the 3rd stage. If you go to the exit while walking in those shrubs then your character will freeze at the door and the machine will take off without you.

Even as an early access title with the potential of improvement, its just not enough to recommend. Fixing the bugs and adding more content won't really change the fundamentals of the game. I'm hesitant to say that the game needs a rework but that would mean making a whole new game entirely. The mining aspect is fun though.",1708063997,1708064211,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Some things below aren't true after some digging, but I'm done with this game for now. I hate bashing my head against a wall for a meager amount of progress.

I've played a lot of survivor games. There are some things in this one I disagree with, but it's overall a shakeup on the formula. It's not a copy paste survivor like, it takes things from different genres. Which if you like that, it's the game for you. Has the same voice lines and a few extra from DRG, has the same music, and level design. Weird choice to have everything more smooth, but I suppose that's the differences with a separate team. Below is going to be my criticisms.

Game hasn't changed much from alpha/beta playtest. It still has the same issues I've outlined before, but somewhat alleviated by health on level up and pushing things away. However, the issues of directional guns have only been magnified by some guns shooting forwards. These guns are pretty much useless, given your face is in the rocks mining for ore most of the time. Imo directionals were always a bad staple in this genre, because omnidirectional weapons are preferred and typically outperform them. They feel awkward to use, and even more awkward here.

Meta upgrades for the most part outside of damage feel useless and needlessly grindy. Thankfully they took the suggestion to input the mineral trading from DRG, but there's still quite a few issues. Since most dwarves aren't the driller, they do not get all the materials on a level often. Even the driller doesn't always grab them all, since you have to contend with a hoard. This is also due to the forced ""fastness"" of the game, which is baked in. I don't like being forced to kill things at a certain speed, especially when the game vomits enemies on me. If you take too long, the bugs get stronger. If you miss the drop pod, your run is over. So many things adding up that I don't get to explore the entire level... unless I'm a driller.

Instead of traversal tools, most of the dwarves instead got a class. However, the driller did not, and thus becomes my most preferred class due to my playstyle. There is two ways to increase movement speed, movement speed itself and mining speed. Without upgrades, the driller gets up to 50% more drill speed. That's a 50% bonus over other dwarves, and the scout doesn't even come close, even with his subclass. Considering the meta upgrade for drilling is pitiful, this is a major problem for other classes. I don't want to play other classes than the driller (I like the cryo cannon, and it's locked behind a high level) due to this, since it feels like I am playing a slower version where I don't have weapons always on bugs.

Sure the difficulty increases, but I'm not sure if it gives more rewards? There's still some things that are less clear. Like how fire rate or reload speed interact with weapons that don't have those stats, or where duration is despite some weapons having this stat, but I don't think it's a meta upgrade. DRG clearly labeled higher hazard levels at the mission select having an increase in mission rewards for the difficulty increase. It also said where I'd find the special upgrade resources, but that is also absent here. The more information I have on things, the better imo.

Lastly, to go with weapon design, anything with penetration/penetration overclock is superior to others. I always take penetration overclock if the weapon didn't start with it. Also, the game has 4 weapons but due to the design of the upgrades, you'll most likely only upgrade 1 or 2 at most. The game also forces you to get a new gun to level 12 before you can unlock overclocks, which often requires you to throw a run away because there are simply not enough upgrade opportunities to get a gun upgraded. I often was doing suicide runs all the way to the boss getting 2-3 upgraded a time. A normal run you'd waste 12 upgrade points on a gun but use all the others on weapons with overclocks already. Which feels even worse when your favorite gun from DRG is locked behind level progression and you're already grinding out levels to get the overclocks on other guns. This feels... intuitive. I honestly think you should lower it to needing 6 levels in a new gun because you already don't get overclocks for the rest of the run. It shouldn't be something you have to kill a run over just to unlock something. Drop pods are also guilty of this (75% crit chance, 300 hp, etc.) where you have to force a stat to get a potential bonus for the rest of your runs from drop pods. There's no way you would get these normally, considering the gameplay loop is get main gun to 18, get secondary gun to 12, other 2 weapons probably aren't going to get overclocks. Another thing you have to throw a run away for because you get lucky and you get enough upgrades to go for one of these achievements.

While I added some suggestions to my criticisms, I realize that most of these issues are baked into the game and my view point might not be everyone's. I do like fast paced survivor likes, but I never felt like I was missing out on meta progression before because the game is moving too fast. I also never quite so violently disliked gun's directional attack more than I do here because if it's pointing forwards then it's not shooting most of the time while I'm mining.

Even you are not a fan of the original Deep Rock Galactic, this game is still recommended. I've played demo for like 20 hours and 2 hours on this early launch, everything feels great. The difficulty is higher than demo, but I would say this game is pretty balanced. It is a much different but better (in my opinion) compared to Vampire Survivors. Better graphic, more balanced (you won't be super powerful after upgrades like VS), and more refined gameplay. You get the similar features such as overclocking from OG DRG, which are super fun.

I just want to say, complexity and a ton of extra mechanics isn't necessary for every game ever. Can they make games better? Sure. But there's nothing wrong simplicity in video games either. Frankly, a lot of players AND devs these days thinks making a overly complex game is how you make a good game and I'm really sick of it. 

This game is very simple and basic, upgrades are pretty straightforward and streamlined, and all you really do at the end is kite around while killing bugs from the beginning to kiting around and absolutely shredding or nuking bugs at the end. I see something with more legs than two, that thing will be dead in a matter of seconds and that gets my serotonin going awooga. Drop in, start from being a greenbeard that dies on stage one of Haz 1, become a greybeard that could even potentially compete with Karl himself at the end of Haz 5. Bonus points for the fact you can press V to RnS!

Simple games are fun. Simple games are good. Simple games are fine. If you want more complex rouge-lites, then there's plenty of other games to play. This is not one of them and that's perfectly okay. I'm personally happy to play something that's incredibly basic at its core and stays that way from beginning to end, very much like Deep Rock Galactic itself.

This game has very a good core:
The choices between resource gathering and fighting / exp 
tunnelling / mining to create kill box or to escape.
Rock & stone!

At hazard 3 out 5, even an upgraded character will struggle to fight basic mobs
A lot of weapons are ineffective against elites or the boss Juggernaut, only a few builds works
Targeting exploding bugs is the only real viable strategy

- This is more like Gerty than Vampire Survivors.
- There is no multiplayer. You're going to have to wait for DRG Rogue Core for that.
- If you played the demo, you'll notice that the game has become harder and the grinding for upgrades will be a lot longer.
- Supply Pods now require cleaning of the landing zone before arriving. A bit annoying at first but manageable once you get some upgrades and/or know how to make the bugs clean the area for you.
- The bosses at the end of each one the 5 stages of the run have a ""Stonger Enemies and Spawn new Enemies"" Trigger during their battles. You can't take your time to kill them anymore and this trigger can be activated multiple times.
- There's still a chance that you will die on the first floor of the first stage on Hazard 1 more than once (The devs have slightly nerfed Haz 1 difficulty on Feb 15th). Don't get frustrated with that.
- Cryo is OP.
- Lootbugs can only be killed with the Pickaxe. They will block your shots and WILL block your path while the Dreadnought prepares their 100+ damage jumping attack.
- Golden Lootbugs are really rare in this game.

If you're new to the garlic-like/bullet heaven/survivors genre then you'll probably enjoy it well enough. If you're an Aficionado so to speak then you might end up dissapointed.

I like the destructible terrain, it creates interesting decisions and fits thematically. I also like the mining aspect, again, sort've gives you something to think about; do you have time to mine that gold or are the enemies trailing you going to catch up? Side missions are nice but ultimately I feel like they tend to take you away from the action. All in all a very active survivors game, something taht I think a lot of people will enjoy; I know I tend to get pretty bored partway through survivors runs once I start mulching everything. You're definitely running around and exploring in this game moreso then most survivors games.

Downsides... weapons and artifacts. Which are most of the upgrades in the game at current. I realize they were taking weapons from DRG, but something needs to be done to make them more interesting. The majority of them are ""fire bullets at this angle"", and it's just not very interesting. Similarly artifacts don't really seem to synergize with much of anything. I was expecting to be able to make a ""cold build"" or whatever, but the artifact synergies just aren't there. I think there's a lot to be done here in particular; I like the xp/nitra/gold scanners but it's just sort've boring. Would be neat to see an artifact that increases damage based on terrain mined or something. That sort've thing. Also in general there is just a lot of polish to be done. I'm confident it will get done, but expect to see placeholder text in some mostly cosmetic places, and some missing punctuation. It's not a huge deal.

however and this is a big caviat:
beeing EA or not, this one is as buggy as a game can be

weapons not working or passive buffs: you name it, this EA got it

- Weapons are boring as hell - Shoot bullets in a straight line! Shoot electric bullets in a straight line! Shoot bullets in 4 straight lines! Shoot bullets in a horizontal line! Shoot one big bullet! Its so uninspired. 

- Upgrades are boring +% damage/fire rate/reload speed. No synergies or interesting status effect combos. Weapons have an overclock you can pick every 6 levels, but those are also for the most part stupidly boring like simply converting damage type or +% more damage but -% reload speed!!!!

Firstly, it's in early access and already provides that satisfying autoshooter loop we've come to love from hit titles like ""Vampire Survivors"" and for what it has on offer it's been a real treat. We have out of the box:

4 classic dwarves we've come to love from the DRG franchise with their own weapons and unique passives, lots of unlock-able artifacts that alter your playstyle for each dive, 3 unique biomes that are different from one another and challenge your playstyle, and the mining aspect we've all come to love from the original game.

Progression feels fair, builds feel satisfying as you level, each Dwarf (class) has progression that changes starting equipment/passives, and you have your overall account progression that helps every run going forward. On top of that, we can see our Dwarves individual levels, an account level (who doesn't love seeing their progress?) and milestones that further show off your progression while giving you unlocks for each run. 

Is it perfect? No, their needs to be more mission variety and objectives to spice up the runs. It would also be amazing if we could unlock cosmetics similar to the original game. But for what you're getting at this asking price it's an easy recommendation if you like these types of games. Also, we know these developers care and go the extra ""rock and stone"" mile so just look at their tentative road-map and think how big this game will be down the road.

Vote with your wallet, support these devs, and dive you dwarves!

I probably wouldn't be as frustrated with that as I am if the game felt fun but boy does it not do that. the gameplay is slowly doddering around, running into walls to mine things and having your dwarf shoot for you, usually with confusing/frustrating targeting priority. it's really annoying to be getting shit from mission control about not clearing bugs quick enough when it's genuinely entirely out of my hands. when you see yourself getting surrounded, that's it, you have done all you can. there's no clever tricks or abilities to use to get around/through bugs, it's just stand there and hope the guns on your head shoot a hole through the bugs (they won't).

 a lot of the voice lines in DRG:S are reused from the base game too, and the environment of crystal caverns is stripped down to what's necessary to communicate information and nothing more. a blown-out jpg of a shock crystal stretched across the skybox would be more interesting than the black nothingness. oh yeah and the meta-progression is SLOW AS FUCK and NOT AT ALL INTERESTING. do a whole run for +2% xp in runs. great wow very cool.

I've played this a fair bit now and rather than me being driven by fun, it was more me being driven by curiosity and the hope of finding something interesting in this game. 

-Every single dive is and feels the same but different biome. 
-The game looks really Really good, probably the best looking in the genre IMO. 
-The only classes that feel the slightest bit unique is Driller and Engineer.
-Weapons feel weak, even if you are shredding some of the swarm, it still feels underwhelming. 
-There's a clear ""take this weapon or lose"" choice (or lack thereof) in this game. Which will deter people from experimenting with other weapons. 
-Stat Progression barely adds anything, it's boring, slow and feels meaningless. 
-Unlocking an overclock for a weapon is done in such an unfun way, i wonder if the devs played their own game. 

Do hazard levels do anything? i wen't up to H3 and i genuinely didn't feel a difference between H1 and H3. 


Weapon variety is also lackluster. The game suffers from being too grounded in Deep Rock Galactic. While, of course, it's nice to see all the weapons from DRG, they should've added more unique weapons/gadgets to the game. The overclocks are uninteresting and most of them are either just stat upgrades ie: '25% dmg 25% fire rate' or an elemental effect that all kinda do the same thing ie: Fire damage, plasma(itbounceswhooooo...) and acid. The Worst part is the crappy overclocks that give IE: '100% damage but -50% fire rate.' it's such a huge draw back that you basically gain zero DPS benefit from taking this.

The game has the potential to be the best in the survivor genre, but my love for DRG is not gonna make me see this game through rose-tinted glasses. (nor do i care if some mad nerd is giving me free steam points)

I wanted to like it so much, but it's just worse than the demo was.

EDIT: So it turns out the meter for progression through the level is based on kills, not time spent. Since you get nearly all your money and a good chunk of your XP through mining rather than fighting, this means getting into combat is outright detrimental to your chances of winning.

In a VS-style game.

This decision is, to be blunt, so obviously terrible that it harms my ability to believe the devs can improve the game through patches, because it makes me think they have no clue what they're doing with the mechanics of the game. Avoid.",1708027650,1708044629,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It is very addicting and I am having a lot of fun enjoying it. I haven't even beaten a run yet and still I keep playing. This game feels like DRG meets Spiral Knights, in a way, and I love both of these games. I also really like this game because I can get my DRG fix in while still being able to play with chill vibes, especially when I'm listening to music or just looking to de-stress. This game isn't perfect, though no game that has just been released is, but I will say of all the games I've played at launch, this is definitely my favorite. It is very playable, and I can also see many ways in which updates will improve. And, we know and love the DRG developers and can trust them to not forget about or dump this game, so I look forward to seeing what the future brings for DRG: Survivor. It is clear to me that the devs worked very hard to make sure this game is playable, not broken, and most importantly, enjoyable, before they released it into the world.

Seems people keep misunderstanding that this isn't DRG 2, it's Vampire Survivors but DRG - and it does so excellently.

I'll re-review it when it leaves early access, but I bought it on launch and fully recommend it for the following reason:

1) If you're new to the genre, this is a good starting place (it was first autoshooter I played back when the Next Fest demo dropped)

2) If you already enjoy the genre, it takes the conventions and twists them around in interesting ways

3) It's Deep Rock Galactic

If you fit any of the three criteria above, get this game.

If you're a fan of DRG, just remember that this is a [i]spin-off[/i] and not a sequel.",1708044041,1708044041,True,1,0,0.505395710468292236,0,True,False,True
