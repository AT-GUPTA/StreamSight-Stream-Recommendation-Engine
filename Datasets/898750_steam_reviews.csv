Maybe this game will get there eventually, but so far I haven't had too hard of time with the battles.  The upgrade and skill system could use a better tutorial, I'm still unsure of what i'm doing there.  Storywise, its weird because you don't have to do missions in order and there are a lot of side missions.

Every single game in the series starting from about half a decade back has been dumbing down the difficulty of the game such that the game becomes extremely boring very quickly. And before you think this is some kind of humblebrag, the game has four separate difficulty settings - even on the hardest setting you have to try to lose.  You can bring the weakest units and just mindlessly move them in and you'll still win. I didn't even want to bring my favorite mechs because of how much it trivialized everything. How much does it cost to repair a mech?  I have no idea, it has literally never happened to me.

They took out the (optional) SR points which gave each mission a tactical objective you could aim for. They removed optional bosses that would give useful drops if defeated when they weren't supposed to be.

They also thought it would be funny to put the start key as Auto on the remote control as opposed to menu like it is in most modern games, kept having my muscle memory kick in and bam! Suddenly my unit's are doing braindead manuvers.

No autosave slot either, theres really no excuse for this.

You cannot turn off the audio sliders completely for voices, music or sfx for god knows what reason.

For most series featured you're dropped into the middle of or beginning of their stories and there's plenty of information in the library to learn about the characters, mechs, locations, etc. Seeing characters from different series butt heads with each other is always a treat, this game really feels like the kinda what if scenarios you'd make with your friends as a kid, watching all of these shows. More than that, the game ties a few concepts together from different series which makes this combined world feel more, real I guess? Like they all belong together and aren't just dropped into a sandbox.

Now, comparing it to X,T, and V there are some changes I liked to how the games play and a few I don't.

My favorite thing about the game is the length of it. This is a pretty long game especially when compared to the others and even without the DLC. I love it! Bouncing back and forth between Earth and space, pocket dimensions, alien planets, the emergency alerts; All of this really helps set the tone of a team of warriors from all over coming together to combat cosmic calamities. This one isn't as linear as previous entries (I'm comparing it to V/T/X), you're given a couple missions at a time and can mostly do them in any order, unless there's an emergency. The bonus to all of this is that you can even thought it all ends up the same you can choose your route and unlock the characters you're more interested in. Beyond the story and front missions there's a whole other set of them with special conditions. Wave battles where your squad fights against up to 10 waves of enemies with bosses popping in, Escort missions, 1-turn to win, 3 unit battles, and more.

 In 30 it's a lot easier to max out your characters. The front missions are pretty much always available and you can rake in Power Parts and Skill Points. I feel like there are way more resources to go around than in prior games. I don't feel like I have to stick with the same few units, they're all viable. Though unlike in the other games, in the final missions I basically blow enemies a part with a look and it doesn't really feel too fun unless I up the difficulty.

For fans of TRPGs looking for another game to play I wouldn't recommend this game unless you're into mechs or anime. 

I'm a huge fan of TRPGs and I had never played a Super Robot Wars game before. I'm glad I waited for it to be on sale before giving it a try. Overall I'm not a huge fan of the game. The story is okay. Half the characters you recruit have the same copy pasted backstory of ""OMG I got teleported to a parallel universe. I guess I'll just join this army of giant robots and fight in a war until I get home."" I did enjoy the stories for certain main characters like Grissman.

The game looks great and the battle animations are top notch. The only issues is they last so long it gets repetitive to watch them and I ended up disabling them. The soundtrack is great and I really like the personality of the little cut scenes when you back out to the title.

Where the game falls apart for me is the gameplay. All units have range and there is little to no terrain interaction. All maps just feel like one big giant square. The objective is to beat the mission to collect various currencies to upgrade and make your mechs and pilots overpowered. Then you go into the next mission and stomp the enemies even harder after your all upgraded. The cycle gets repetitive and there isn't much different about each of the maps. The game is extremely easy, even on Expert.

Updated Review:
I tried redownloading and playing this game again but quickly gave up after two maps. The TRPG gameplay is not fun when compared to other games on the market. The game is more about experiencing your favorite mech shows and universe and flashy moves than actual tactical combat. I still stand by the idea that if you're into mechs and mech anime you will probably like this game but overall it was not for me and would not recommend it.",1655509813,1695085297,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is the first to be localized AND available in the west, which in itself is already great. Compared to other entries it remains very similar to ""recent"" post-Z releases, meaning it's quite easy and doesn't feature a squad system, which is a shame as I quite liked that. It's also quite long even for the series, but it has an interesting feature that is a first: free scenario selection (up to a point). Basically several missions pop up at the same time and you can choose what you want to do in any given order, meaning the game doesn't come through as linear as it used to, but branching isn't very clear. At specific points scenario missions become a must and you cannot do anything else unless you complete them. But the great thing here is that even with all DLC dialogue is mostly coherent even if you play stuff in random order, which is not an easy feat. Now the original characters aren't particularily interesting, that goes specifically for the mech pilot and the mech itself which is on the boring side. Included series lean heavily on the Z Infinity saga and the more recent main timeline Gundam outings. Some Yuusha was also used again this time, but as with ""T"", it's not as cringe as I had feared. DLC on the other hand is really only if you wish for one of those mechs to be included in your roster, otherwise it doesn't really add anything outside of a few specific missions and dialogue (that, again, is inserted quite well).",1692110452,1692110452,True,5,0,0.573304176330566406,0,True,False,False

If your main draw to this game isn't checking out all of the attack animations and seeing characters from a bunch of mecha animes interact with each other, than this game isn't for you.

7.5/10

My biggest gripes are that the enemy designs and animations leave much to be desired, some of the ally attack animations seem half-baked (although there are enough cool ones to make up for this), and the writing is pretty terrible. It could just be translation issues, but i doubt it. I think the main issue with the writing is that there's just way too much of it. Almost every interaction seems to last way longer than it should.  It reminds me of how One Piece episodes can be 20 mins long but only have 5 mins of content; same vibe.

It drags on for far too long with more than a hundred missions of the exact same thing, mash your blob against the enemy's blob and spam evasion/damage skills, there's not really any strategy beyond this even on higher difficulties because there's no mission or map variety, almost every mission is ""kill x units"" or ""kill the leader unit"" and every map might as well be a flat plane with no obstacles because despite looks, terrain does nothing other than make a unit move a tile slower or faster, it doesn't create choke points, it doesn't force units into certain roles, maps are just backdrops, and there are no impassable obstacles. The only time you get any mission variety is when you do a few of the optional missions, and even then it's ""kill enemy unit in one hit"" or ""kill x enemy units in one move"" with one or two ""protect the npc"", I can count on one hand the number of 100+ main missions that actually had you do something other than collide action figures into each other.
On top of the gameplay concerns, the translation is pretty spotty, coming off of watching Majestic Prince, you have things like characters referring to Ange as they instead of he/she, which was the joke in the show, no one knew Ange's gender, so they just referred to Ange as he or she as a running gag, and then there's other things like shiokara not being translated and the Julia System being referred to as the Juria System. Outside of that series in particular, you have multiple grammar issues around the game as a whole, and playing as one main character of one sex, sometimes the supporting cast will refer to you as he or she when it's not the case.
I've heard good things about earlier games in the series like Original Generation, but 30, as the first game to bring over to the west, doesn't make a good impression.

SRW 30 is a great simple Turn-Based strategy game, with a decent mishmash story that SRW is known for. Those who knows the series know what they're getting into, while if this is your first then it's fine but has so many subsystems that you really need somebody to teach you all the little knick knacks. 

For old-time SRW players, SRW 30 is pretty much easy mode all the way through unless you do your first playthrough at the highest difficulty.

Nice animations, great music and voice acting, and some interesting choices in units to bring over. However, the more open ended nature of it means that the core of the game suffers due to needing to cater to many different scenarios depending on how the player chose to proceed. Sometimes you have a time limit that means you're encouraged to binge on any side missions ASAP so you don't get stung by it later on down the line. 

This creates a big problem in my mind, especially if you have the DLC. Unlike in other SRW games, the DLC is just thrown at you near the start, letting you do it whenever you want. But because time limits exist you have to do it right away. And it just leads to the player slogging through a bunch of side content instead of the main story, getting a whole bunch of items that'll make an already easy game even easier. Story wise the DLC is also of a lesser quality, as it is mostly just introducing a new character to you who will then join your crew.

I'd probably recommend skipping the DLC - except for the premium sound one for some great vocal accompaniments - and just play the base game. Hopefully when they do another SRW game they'll return to a more linear nature, or at the very least make sure that the game spreads out its content in a much more easy to digest way so as to avoid player stress and fatigue and maintain enjoyment.",1684061666,1684061666,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

[h1]Q: what is mecha?[/h1]
A: a genre of anime/manga revolving around (usu) giant robots piloted by (usu) humans doing giant robot things like fighting each other, kaiju, aliens, gods, etc.

[h2]Q: what is super robot wars?[/h2]
A: the ongoing love letter to the japanese genre of mecha anime in the form of a turn-based strategy game/visual novel.  30th anniversary edition.  if you have played a SRW game before, then you know the drill.  this outing does not try to innovate much from the formula which is mostly a good thing IMO.  It's like a mecha junky's comfort food. I can't think of anything as fan positive in the world of gaming AND anime as the Super Robot Wars franchise.  It is a very child-friendly game due its somewhat forgiving nature in terms of difficulty.

even at the higher difficulty levels, this is not a hard game to beat.  it is a lengthy one, though.  lots of cringy dialogue as a result of forcing a bunch of unrelated franchises into one nexus of reality.  they did their best, i suppose with a near impossible writing task.  all in the admirable service of answering such imponderables as who is stronger, Quattro Bajeena or that red Magicknight Rayearth?

seriously though, the game mechanics are totally effed.  like, what is even the point of having hit percentages with the existence of common activated abilities like 100% hit and 100% dodge?  like is said, kid friendly.  still somehow fun as hell.  i guess from an optimization perspective.  like, what is the most efficent or fun way to make credits and xp to upgrade my mechs and pilots?  and also, giant hand-drawn animations of robots go BOOM!

The male protagonist is likable, a rarity from Japan.  You can also play as his meh imouto.  why would you do that though unless you are going to 100% it.  trust me, the chick is boring.  unless that's your thing.  i'm not judging you.",1637868100,1681537232,True,1,0,0.498257845640182495,0,True,False,False

If you like turn-based grid tactics and want some suggestions for mecha series to check out, by all means give this a shot.   POST-DLC AND COMPLETION UPDATE:I still love this game and will continue to put hours into it, but I felt it important to come back after all the DLC has come out and I've seen through to the end of the game and expand on things some more.Firstly, the Deluxe OST. It's definitely overpriced, but I understand this is due to licensing fees with JAM Project, and JAM pretty much exists to give artists more power and leverage when negotiating usage of their work, so...here's the end result. It's still worth it to me, but my biggest complaint is that it's incomplete. SRX and Cybuster have lyrical themes from the past, and they're GREAT. But they're still not included in the Deluxe OST for no reason I've been able to find word of. TL;DR it's entirely optional and only matters if you have some favorite tracks you really want to hear.    The ""main"" DLCs are pretty good, but the quality feels inconsistent at times. Gundam Barbatos' attacks mostly feel minimalist and rushed, like they wanted to use as few frames as possible aside from his two finishing attacks. Yet the other Iron Blooded Orphans units have much longer animations and more frequent shots of the models in their fully animated form, rather than ""sprite"" form, pretty much upstaging the poster boy himself. On a similar note, the Ultraman units can be made OP fairly easily, but their attacks are even more rushed and bare-bones than Barbados', which I can only chalk up to the difficulty of capturing a 100% CG anime in 2D sprite form. I feel like if it was that difficult, maybe don't do it, but they probably had the crossover agreement made in advance, so w/e. Now, those being the main complaints of the DLC, I should move on to the positives, which are just as if not more important. Aside from the better animated units in this and other DLCs, you also get new side missions to go with them, and the side quests pretty much always lead to unlocking new attacks for related units, as well as unique ""break point"" bonuses they can activate by performing well enough in a deployment to reach a certain threshold of morale. And despite previous complaints, the attacks unlocked via side mission are always on the higher end of the quality spectrum, being both stronger and more visually impressive.   Now, on a final note, I should really address the elephant in the room, because it's far and away my biggest complaint of all. The localisation quality. From an objective standpoint, there are STILL at the time of this writing numerous grammatical and formatting errors (including text just running off the edge of the screen instead of continuing to the next line down) throughout multiple characters' dialogue, including fight dialogue that *will* appear multiple times. This alone is frankly unacceptable for a full priced product, and I genuinely hope whoever was hired for this localisation is now looking for work elsewhere. Beyond that, injecting memes into translations is always destined to age poorly, and it's even worse when you pick decade-old memes that were stale and Facebook Mom-tier back when I was still in high school when Crates had just been introduced to Team Fortress 2. (""Boom goes the dynamite""? F*cking REALLY?!?) There are some genuinely funny character moments, quite a few to be honest, but I attribute the comedic value to the original writers and whatever limited restraint the localizer arbitrarily expressed. I'm aware there's controversy around how a bunch of character dialogue about gender identity was translated regarding Majestic Prince, but as I have never seen the series, I can't speak to the accuracy of any of it, and don't honestly care. From what I've seen of side-by-side comparisons, the character in question is ambiguously portrayed in both versions and the EN version just has other characters being weirdly hostile about people asking about a third party's identity. It's a pointless change, I admit, but it doesn't get one hundredth of one percent of the ire that seeing an early 80's legacy animated character like Daba Myroad saying ""Cray-cray"" does. When the localiser isn't projecting their frustrations or awful stagnated meme culture into the dialogue, it's C+ adaptation work and leads to some enjoyable moments. When their restraint slips, it becomes D- cringe and makes you appreciate the better moments more. An unfortunate half-in-the-bag case that I hope is rectified with a different hire for the next game.   All in all, having finished it, I'd give this an 8/10. Strong replay value with the branching/locking mission paths and a wealth of hidden recruitable units, along with a good old fashioned Secret Real Ending. I would pay double digits for DLC that is just a more professional translation version.",1658190948,1679682018,True,34,0,0.761401712894439697,0,True,False,False

For the first time, player can manage various things in the flagship by using AOS feature. I enjoy the feeling of acting as a fleet commander.

The battle animations are very good. Commoner soldiers have their own battle voices. The explode animations correspond to different units and weapons.

There are many random combat missions. These missions will give you the chance to train your forces and get enough resources. The most effective way is to battle with a god in the Oceania region.

Cons:

Please just translate what was actually said next time. If you don't like what the writer wrote, get a different job instead of choosing not to do the one you have properly.

Update: There's a patch to revert these changes which you can find in the guides section.


Edit again: I may as well also note at this point that 30 is one of the worst games in the series of the dozen or so games that I've played, and it's easily the worst one to have received an official English release. The difficulty / balance is completely broken, the original hardest difficulty became a joke only a few hours in, and the extra harder difficulty they patched in actually made the game even easier by raising the level cap and thus giving the player even more SP to use. Accordingly the entire game may as well be played on auto for how little thought it requires, it is by far the most braindead game in the series in terms of difficulty, and it's so fundamentally poorly designed that there's no salvaging it short of self-imposed no upgrade challenges.
The story is also poorly handled, with dozens upon dozens of filler missions where nothing actually happens and the enemies just run away after being defeated. There is a 40 hour game here that's been stretched into a 150+ hour game by how many pointless filler missions there are spread over its duration. Some of the original cast members are alright, but it definitely doesn't compare to V or X's cast either, and the original mecha are rather dull too.

Was surprised to see Magic Knights Rayearth in the game. The cast of Victory Gundam's names are spelled way weird from what I was expecting. Come on, ""Coni"" - We know this was supposed to be ""Connie"".  L-Gaim characters did nothing for me, nor did any of the GGG teams, or the Code Geass team. 

The SRW mech like Huckbein, Gespent, etc weren't touched unless necessary and I despised the color named mech that were piloted by characters that looked like they came from Gundam SEED.

However this game has two minor issues that the Developers need to address someday....

1.) If you play the game in Windowed Mode, your mouse is stuck in the game window and you'll need to Alt+Tab to leave the game window and free up your mouse. Also if you play with a gamepad, the mouse still aometimes affects the ingame cursor moving it without any input from the player.

What's strange though is that this wasn't an issue in Super Robot Wars V and X, and those games are older than this one so  they SHOULDN'T have screwed this up.

2.) There is no in-game means to delete save files. Again looking back on V and X, those two allowed you to delete your save files with a confirmation of a button. You would highlight the save file you want to delete then Press a button (the Y Button on my XBox Controller IIRC) then the game will ask you if you really want to delete your file or not.

But in this game I had to look up a guide that involves messing about with the Steam Cloud and messing about with the actual game save files on my Steam installation folder. Why oh why Bandai-Namco? What were you thinking?",1675875933,1675876357,True,19,2,0.697361230850219727,0,True,False,False

I am a veteran SRW for myself and yeas, it is too easy for us cause we already know which good part to use on early, How to upgrade the unit properly. How to build the support unit. But for the newplayer it should be hard on the first try in Expert mode.

I recomended this game cause there are some new change that make you excited. They make a good animation on some unit and dissapoint on the other. I cant expect they did all the best on this section. I ca said they do some innovative thing on this game, so veteran can enjoy it too

For Developer team, what we miss here is the challanging part. I hope the next game we can do one mission with split area. So one mission with 2 different area, so we need to divide our team on those area. It is quite challanging cause we will need to up most of mecha we had.

Super Robot Wars 30 is fun, but rushed.

There's a lot of neat things about it. I had fun playing the game. A great aspect of the game is how it shifts tactical importance from dodging to defense, meaning Armor and L size units now have a much more balanced relationship with dodge-demons like the Gundam and Macross pilots. This also means combat spirits like ""Wall"" and ""Persist"" become just as important as old favorites like ""Focus"" and ""Flash"". I also love the focus the game has on developing the main battleship as both a character and an upgradeable base of operations. Finally, it features a lot of franchises I like and it even brought the first officially-translated-to-english iteration of the Banpresto OG cast for the first time since Super Robot Wars Taisen 2... for the GBA. This alone got me to play it to the end.

Me and Zeb found ourselves gravitating to Mitsuba, the captain of the battleship, as the real main character. Not only is she MUCH better written and entertaining than Edge/Az, but also comes across as believable as the head of a massive battleship of great responsibility. She was easily the best character written for the game. I'm glad she's the marketing face for the game, because she deserves it.

Some of the music choices are good while others are... meeeh. The expanded library of music for the good guys is definitely a plus (Divine Beast, Unyielding Wish, Sword that Smites Evil, Platinum Lucifer, Steel Beowulf, YES!) and there's even some remixes of the old GBA mission music which is always welcome, but the use of the generic 'we are under attack' theme got really repetitive and obnoxious, especially in the more formulaic missions, to the point that me and Zeb were borderline calling out which song would play at each point of the visual novel segments.

Unfortunately, I could also talk about the amount of missed opportunities in the game for hours. In fact, I have talked about it, with Zeb during the streams lol For the most part, there's a lot of animations, sounds and storylines directly recycled from their last release (Super Robot Wars T), but also a regrettable lack of foresight about the fun synergy a lot of the included franchises could have. I think it's damning, for example, that by the end of the game, approximately 4/5ths of my sortied team (meaning the 10-15 characters of the cast of 80+ that I regularly pick for missions) were either SIDE characters, or characters from the DLC packs which aren't integrated into the game's story. 

This means that despite the fact they are inherently crippled in their ability to 'feel part of the group', since the game doesn't develop them as characters, I still preferred to bring Kallen, Leecee, Chirico, Kyosuke, Ryusei, Mikazuki, Irm and Kusuha to tag along with mains like Van, because they were just far more fun to play with and imagine interactions with Van than.... Ernie from Knights & Magic 😕 A character designedto be an annoying Mary Sue.

The designated main character, which we lovingly renamed Elly (so that her name wouldn't be Az), is also... kinda bad? We don't know what Edge, the male version, is like, but the girl is of that type of phony character that is designed like a fashionable highschool ace, but yet is written like a shy loser trying to discover herself.  There's a bunch of sexual tension scenes between her and Mitsuba written with the dumb casualness of straight-sexuality romance that clearly shows she is written with the male character's script, except they exchanged all the 'he's for 'she's. 

Going to the main story of the game, it starts off with some intriguing aspects; we had fun poking guesses at the Sci-Fi plot about the ethics and sociology of robot/clone loved ones and the many franchises included in the game are more or less well weaved, but unfortunately, like I said, the game is rushed and along Acts 3-5 it starts letting you down more and more. With the featured franchises, at some point they just give up on welding the stories together and instead recreate the entire plots of the animes they come from in Mission form. Majestic Prince has the WEIRDEST finale, with their show's story just ending abruptly with the quiet shoot down of the main bad guy, followed by a couple of side optional missions going into its movie, which is very odd considering the game imports a HUGE anime scene introducing the characters in their first mission that implies they would be a big deal.

Gridman seems to be the show they put the most chips on. A whole series of custom CGI art for the visual novel scenes, mostly of Akane sitting in her trashbag-filled room complaining about her schemes going awry, is included (not to mention the stuff you've seen screenshotted above), the character of Gridman is easily the most stat-enforced unit of the game other than the GaoGaiGar (who enjoys memetically strong status in the history of the franchise)  and there's a lot of effort trying to recreate the internal dynamic of the show's characters. So if you like Gridman, you'll enjoy this game.

And then there's Knights & Magic...... Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck!

Ernie sucks, okay 😐 

I'm not being a prick here, he legit sucks! Ernie is that kind of character that reminds you that anime is currently in the hands of fans whose role model is the main character of End of Evangelion. He is so annoying. And the game loves him so goddamn much. Me and Zeb talked for hours about all the little things that showed how he was the epytomal Mary Sue stereotype, yes, but also, in a creepier way, how he represents these gross, insecure, Isekai fantasies about mecha and fantasy male fans wanting to turn magically into genius little girls on anime genres they nerd about. 😦 

Everytime something... anything was going on in the game, the game just HAD to bring in Ernie to give some fanboy-comment about how he understood the trope of what was going on, or how Super Robots were fan-gasmically cool, or how he was sure from the start that everything was gonna be fine, cause that's ""what he loves about Mecha shows"",  or that he's just so completely confident and cool about the ongoing situation. AND HE'S NEVER WRITTEN TO BE WRONG! Ernie is never surprised, or caught off guard by anything or one-upped by anyone; he's a true Mary Sue end to end.
------------------
TLDR, Ernie can go to hell.
------------------

Anyway, game is okay. It's not the best the franchise has done, but it's a good effort considering the time and resources Bandai gave the developers. I'd give it... 6 Gundams out of 10. Maybe 7 if you like the particular franchises in it.",1674258079,1674258079,True,2,0,0.52048194408416748,0,True,False,False
898750,131173897,76561198837983709,0,2,10650,0,7562,1690829410,"FINALLY a super robot wars game that I can access with ease! For the love of god bandai release the next game on steam! Sadly though not everything can be The Mummy starring Brendan Fraser, meaning perfect. I have some gripes with this game most of my gripes can be put up to my personal taste, personal theories on poor management behind the scenes, and my annoyance with franchises chosen for the base game. But anyway I will go over my favourite additions to the game and make a quick comment on the parts I liked and outright hated.

CHANGE GETTER 1! SWITCH ON! I bought this for getter robo and I have to admit I was dissapointed that the Getter Robo inclusion in this game felt very half-assed. We get the usual getter team (the one from Armageddon aka the only that exists according to Bandai) but the Getter in the base game is from the most underrated hidden gems in the strategy rpg genre that being shin getter dragon from Getter Robo Daikassen despite  the lack of an english patch I highly recommend playing it on any PS1 emulator. The reason this confuses me is because that Daikassen is the biggest love letter to Getter Robo imaginable and yet the characters we have are from Armageddon the only conclusion I can come to is that they wanted to save time on Getter Robo so they picked a robot with one form to cut down on time not to mention that Go, Gai, and Kei are basically nothing Gai and Kei just show up with barely a mention of Gai prior to his appearance and the Shin Getter Dragon that THEY pilot is literally just reused assets from a prior game character sprites and all.

The reason this bothers me so much is because we have several different series of Gundam and they couldn't cut out one of them to give some extra love to Getter Robo? I think people can sleep at night without them including Narrative Gundam (sorry if that's your favourite series but it struck me as the most uninteresting outside of one mission and the protagonist's role in the story could have easily been filled by Uso) and Majestic Prince that felt like a worthy addition (and in case my sarcasm wasn't noticed I couldn't give less of a shit about those characters Evangelion was robbed)

Getter Robo is my favourite Mecha franchise of all time and it deserved better than this blatantly lazy inclusion I enjoy the armageddon characters but they all felt like an afterthought compared to gun x sword, lelouch, and victory gundam. Ryoma especially plays a supporting role for most of the story and when the cast finally comes together it's in a GaoGaiGar mission and the end of their story is at the end of Mazinger's story. and ironically the best inclusion for getter robo i'd argue comes from one of the most divisive pieces of getter robo media; Devolution which is in a £15 expansion which isn't even included in the deluxe edition for some reason the reason i consider Devolution to be the best is the sheer amount of effort that went into it, the animators went above and beyond bringing that manga unit to life with it's vibrant colours it makes the attacks a joy to watch and it made armageddon's inclusion feel so half assed they should've cut a few of the franchises and gone much further with the inclusion of a Daikassen unit, bring the manga characters in! Give us Getter Robo G Shin Getter Robo, have the characters upgrade their way to Shin Dragon from Getter 1, anything but this. 

MAZIN GO! Mazinger Z is one of the staples of the franchise but I must admit that Mazinger Z infinity is not my favourite version of the story, Koji's voice actor is fine but that's the problem he's just fine when compared to the Koji's from Mazinkaiser (I'll get to that), and Shin Mazinger. I understand the idea of including older versions of the classic characters from the og super robot wars figure heads but I don't really care I found myself really missing the younger more fiery Koji and personally if they stuck with Shin Mazinger Koji I don't think anyone would've minded the best thing to come out of it was that I got closer to the characters of Shiro and Tetsuya but my god did I miss Boss, Sayaka, and Jun all three of these characters are reduced to background roles and with the inclusion of Mazinkaiser in DLC I would've loved if Aphrodite A, Venus A, and the Boss Borot were included I enjoyed Shiro's relationship with the GaoGaiGar characters which I have conflicted feelings on but that's irrelevant.

The designs of the two Mazingers are not the best I was never a fan of the overly panel lined look of the infinity designs but I'm sure they appeal to someone who favours the more ""real robot"" aesthetic. Mazinger is also lacking in the attack department, I re-watched Infinity to check and just as I expected Mazinger Z has way more bells and whistles than are displayed here most of which get reduced to a cameo in the ""full salvo"" attack which is appreciated but still underwhelming.

And my last thing to say on the Mazinger Z thing is that I basically wished we got a different version of Mazinger most of my complaints would go away if we were to regress a little back to Shin I'm happy with Infinity but it's just kind of underwhelming until the finale.

THE KING OF BRAVES IS BORN! GAOGAIGAR! I have very few complaints when it comes to GaoGaiGar's part in this game while I missed the other Super AI I was spoilt for choice when it came for GaoGaiGar units GaoFighGar and GaoGaiGo were cool additions and King J Der is as much of a powerhouse as it should be. But this game sort of made me realise that Super Robot Wars W spoilt me.

W goes over the original series in detail, and final also in detail including another super ai unit bringing the total in that game to six because they can all combine and decombine at will in that game. This mostly just makes me wish that there was MORE i just wanted MORE and I'm conflicted on this because the final unit for GaoGaiGar is genuinely a beautiful addition and the attacks are eye candy central and beautiful to watch each time if you're a fan of GaoGaiGar you will enjoy it's inclusion especially Gai my god the lungs on that voice actor.

ACCESS FLASH!!  SSSS Gridman was a surprise for me I found the characters appealing, the story enthralling, and Yuta's relationship with Shinjiro (Ultraman DLC only I'm afraid) to be really fun and that's how i'd describe Gridman's inclusion as a whole. Fun. The attacks looked amazing to me, carried mostly by the voice work and music but really cool. Gridman in my eyes is on par Guy Shishioh in terms of uplifting me. I wasn't a Gridman fan coming into this game but it turned me around I watched the anime, I'm working through the Dynazenon, and I'm excited for the movie coming out this year. It might not be for you with it's almost saturday morning cartoon tone but it's right up my alley I love that corny shit.

there are other things I'd like to say but I'm about to hit the character limit. There are certain franchises where I found myself asking. ""Why the heck is this here?"" Majestic Prince being one of them. I don't hate these characters but I'm pretty damn close. It's infuriating how many characters are teased in the front missions that i'd rather be playing with but for some reason we get innumerable different variety of Gundam. I feel like there needed to be better management of the characters but that's just my personal bias of enjoying super robot wars for the classic super robots I really like this game and I recommend it to any strategy rpg fan but damn are there some flaws and some slight Gundam Favouritism.",1674170426,1674170426,True,5,0,0.536057054996490479,0,True,False,False

It's a pretty fun game overall, story wise. The difficulty isn't high to proceed, and most missions don't frustrate you. There are special artifact missions that give you a challenge, which can be solved by grinding recurring missions a bit and focusing on overpowered units.

Did I mention overpowered? The game features a lot of series and unsurprisingly, most, if not all, main character units outshine side character units by an immense margin. If you'd like to play the game with a wide cast, you'd likely be at a disadvantage iin the game. Not too much of a big deal but worthy of note for people who want to play around.

The story is relatively straightforward and self-contained, you don't need a lot of series knowledge to play the game (for better or worse, a lot of original series contexts are stored in the Library for you to read).  Like other SRW games, the plot line revolves around the MC battling recruiting and battling enemies of other series, then facing the world-destroying crisis together with other protagonists. Finely executed even if cliche. There are few, although insignificant typos and translation errors that do not affect the game much, or at all.

The battle system is also straightforward. You use energy or ammo to attack within your range, and damage dealt depends on hit chance and crit chance, which are improved upon skills and upgrades. The AOS system also gives you further boosts and is worth grinding for, Gameplay isn't groundbreaking, but solid enough to enjoy without frying your brain with overloading systems.

DLCs are a huge mixed bag unfortunately. DLCs 1 and 2 give you new units and additional scenarios and dialogue in-game, but do not add much to the story line, if at all. Same goes to DLC3/expansion pack, with minimal interaction to the main game itself. The units themselves are cool (save to Dancougar in DLC3, the animation is extremely disappointing), but you don't need them to improve your in-game experience.

All in all? A decently solid game as a SRW entry. You may need a guide to unlock secret units on your subsequent playthroughs, but for a relaxing day of watching mechs go boom, this is the game for it.

(Written while trying to hide any bias towards included series, so I decided to not discuss the series included. But imo Gaogaigar and Gridman is there and that's enough for me to get the game kek)",1669153393,1669153449,True,0,0,0.496062994003295898,0,True,False,False

While far from perfect, it's a good addition to a long time fan's collection... Though I'm somewhat iffy on if it's a good entry point for new fans - especially ones not familiar with some of the series presented - given how much of the main plot relies on post-series plots while still expecting you to have a grasp of what happened (though the inclusion of a lore encyclopedia helps somewhat.

The game itself looks beautiful, and the soundtrack (whether you shell out for the full vocal option or not) is as brilliant as it's always been, though the actual gameplay isn't quite as strong as past entries; missions are a bit on the easy side even on maximum difficulty, and kind of fall into some predictable patterns by nature of it's non-linear structure, for some people this might be just fine for others I could see this being a sticking point for a strategy game. Another consequence of the non-linear mission structure is the lack of route splits that means a lot of units just won't get much time in the spotlight as you basically always have your full (rather large) roster to work with at all times, but whether that bothers you or not will again come down to personal preference (the inclusion of the squad system from past games would have helped a lot in easing this however).

Where the game really shines is the storytelling and interactions between characters, managing to weave dozens of different series together in a way that's genuinely enjoyable and relatively easy to follow and capable of both having some serious, tense, dramatic moments... And much sillier intermission moments, like the Rayearth girls trying to get the Armageddon era Getter Team to mentor them 'because they're a team of three'; or Van managing to stomach the food of characters infamous for their dire cooking (much to the shock of onlookers).

However, my strongest reason for recommending this title is the hope that this sets a precedent that it's worth the licensing hassle of releasing this series in the west, when our previous best options were importing Asian English copies of a handful of games.",1669152227,1669152227,True,2,0,0.516129016876220703,0,True,False,False

i got this game because i saw a dope alteisen riese model kit at a local hobby store and thought ""this is cool i'll get this and never touch the games."" this was a lie. i debated for like a day straight on it after seeing this was on sale and eventually it won me over, and i quickly bought a dlc pack to get the alteisen.

i read reviews saying that it would be really easy, so i put the difficulty to hard. i didn't set it to the hardest because i figured ""this is my first time with a game like this, i'm sure this'll be hard enough."" this was a mistake, set it to the hardest difficulty. i think one of my units has died like three times and that's it, one time was friendly fire because i literally did not care and the other two were just me flat out forgetting about them. the game is brain dead easy, ESPECIALLY if you get dlc pack 2 like i did. if you want a challenging experience, don't use the alteisen.

Most of my caveats are focused on the Attack Animations(since it's part of the selling point of a SRW game), and SRW30 has passable animations I guess. 
Certain series definitely had more effort/budget put into them (with my personal favorites being SSSS Gridman, J-Decker & L-Gaim), while others not so much (Knights&Magic in particular focused their effort/budget is only focused on Ikaruga. So not only is the other two mechs from K&M very low effort, the red&white mechs from the show that I expected to appear are ignored). SRW30 also starts using the NEW Intro Animation before attacks. However, most of the mechs don't actually utilize it, either due to using old animations from SRW V/X/T or not even bothering to have an intro.
In terms of 100% Completion, I still go ahead and 100% Completed it since its a SRW games. Although I personally don't recommend doing so if you're a casual player. A single playthrough of SRW30 is quite long due to the sheer amount of missions. And while that's really nice for character interaction opportunities(another selling point of a SRW game), it certainly did overstay its welcome for 100% Completion.

Despite this, a casual player probably won't be too bothered by this, as the difficulty is acceptable enough(although removing the SR Point mechanic from older game was definitely a stupid decision), and the series roster is interesting enough for alot of really nice & unexpected character interactions.",1668343686,1668344221,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has given me the most amount of anime recommendation of series I have never heard of than any friend has ever given me. But also it has also made me enjoy the Mecha genre more than I already have as the only series from this genre that I cared about or seen were Gundam, SSSS., and a few others but they are not in this game. Some I never knew about were series like L-Gaim; Majestic Prince; and Brave Police J-Decker for examples.

SRW 30 for short is a very long game for a singular playthrough. Within a single playthrough you will quite possibly have done about 80 to 100+ missions. I am 118 hours in and I have not finished my playthrough yet, others have finished their playthroughs close to the 100s, but I have not.  But that's a good thing, because you can take it at your own pace and you will be fine. 

So, here are some things to take note of. You will have 50+ units to choose from, but you will only be able to use a limited amount of them on each map, so the game recommends you to use the characters you like or have an attachment to and that it is okay to do so, because that is the point of this game and that's nice. So pick the ones you like and enjoy the game as this game has very beautiful animations, which really took me by surprise for this type of game. 

One major thing to take note and I mean major because this is great. You can add in your own BGMs to the game. So you can add in Gallant Char from Mobile Suit Gundam on Char as whenever he fights or an important moment happens, his theme plays. You can pop in COLORS by Flow; Stand Up To The Victory from Victory Gundam; Sorairo Days; HEATS; or even Yusyaou Tanjo as it is sung by Masaaki Endoh. (If you haven't heard him sing, listen to CLEAR MIND or the first OPM op.)

Another little tidbit which I really enjoy is that if you go back to the title screen you will get an intermission and they are very enjoyable to watch as they give you tidbits about the game or even tidbits about their own series that they are from. Which brings me to this, as you play the game the story from their series will play in the game, but it will mainly be the MAJOR plot points and they will be edited in a way that doesn't spoil their series too much. It still spoils stuff but you don't have the context and build up to it along with certain characters being around for the MCs/side characters to be around and save or motivate them when they really needed it. Or seeing like Zanscare working with the Sleeves. 

I do recommend this game as it is a great game and I can see why this series has lasted 30 years. You can see the love and effort put into the franchise to the point that you might revive your love of the genre or even introduce to the genre. So, take your time with this game, have fun, and use who you want to use because there are no wrong answers, but there are hidden characters that are locked behind certain characters.

Biggest complaint is that it gets really easy at a certain point, but it's still fun even after it stops being particularly challenging.

First things first, this game is a tactical RPG in the vein of Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics. The screenshots and videos on the store page do not make this clear, so if you're looking at reviews to figure out what this game even is, there you go.

As for an actual review, I am enjoying this game a lot and am currently 30 hours in. Looking at other reviews, that seems to be about halfway through the story. Coming into the game, the only series from the list of featured series that I have watched is Code Geass (and then not even the movie that's actually present), though I am also aware of early UC Gundam from 0079 to CCA as featured in the game. With that context, I can say that it's easy to adapt to all of the characters from series I'm not familiar with. You get enough interaction to get an idea of their characters, and I definitely have my favorite characters and series that I now really want to watch.

As far as gameplay is concerned, this game falls somewhere in between the power fantasy soft tactics games like SD Gundam G Generation and more traditional TRPGs like FE and FFT mentioned above, with the balance falling towards the latter. I'm playing on the highest difficulty, and I find that I have to make heavy use of my pilots' special abilities and support functions to prevent my units being destroyed. That said, there's no FE-style perma-death, and I've never really been in danger of failing a mission, I'm just preserving my units as a matter of principle. I've also been trying to level all units to a certain degree, rather than just focusing on my favorites. Taking all of those factors into consideration, the game seems to fall on the easy side so far, even on the highest difficulty setting. Unfortunate, but not unusual, and it hasn't really impeded my enjoyment of the game.

Regarding length-to-price ratio, this game has *plenty* of content to keep it going, and incentive for at least one NG+ run. At the time of this review I'm still not brushing up against the end of my first playthrough. That said, it's perfectly possibly to focus the story and complete it faster if that's your preference.",1636471118,1667349373,True,2,0,0.540918171405792236,0,True,False,False

Too many units to choose from. I think I had around 90 units.

(Albeit on PC only.)
For full disclosure, this is my first Super Robot Wars. I imagine it'll be this for many others as well, so I write this review from the perspective of a newcomer to the series.
There's plenty of good as well as well as some bad aspects in the game in my opinion, however your mileage could very likely vary depending on your own tastes and experiences in the Mecha genre.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Good:
+The game has a great pick-up-and-play nature where I can start up the game, pick a mission of my choice and go wild.
+The series list is pretty solid as well, some choices such as Getter Robo Armageddon returning again and Mazinger Z Infinity with its mechanical design style and story may be divisive for more longtime fans of SRW, but there's nice new introductions to the series such as Gundam NT and J-Decker.
+The unification of the different universes in the game is done decently I believe, with the SRW30 world having an established history based on the different franchises included. I'll avoid spoiling much, but one particular example is GaoGaiGar leading into J-Decker.
+The non-linear mission structure gives the player more choice in progression and pacing.
+Being able to add custom music tracks is a great feature.
+Assuming you're not familiar with every series in the game, you'll likely come out with some series you want to watch. For me personally I have interest in watching Betterman, Combattler V and Knight's & Magic after playing the game.
+The original designs for the game are pretty solid, both characters and mechanical designs, even if some may not be as good as those from existing series and previous Original Generation designs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bad:
-While the mission system is good in my eyes, the amount of missions you may find yourself given can be daunting. This is especially true if you have the DLC packs.
-Some series are significantly more represented than others, with series such as Victory Gundam, J-Decker and Gridman having far more representation than some series like Getter Robo, Combattler V and Code Geass for example. You may or may not find this an issue depending on whether you're more here for series you know, or enjoy an introduction to something more fresh to you.
-The localization can be quite questionable at times, having obvious changes from the original Japanese script. With that said it's an issue with the industry as a whole, and I don't believe any significant story points have been changed.
-Some pretty iconic music tracks to fans of the franchises represented don't appear in the base game, meaning you'll either need to add them manually or purchase the Sound & Data pack which a fair few consider overpriced.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With all this said, it may seem like I'm making the game out to be highly flawed. That's not my intention at all, I think this is a fantastic (and addicting) game for any fan of giant robots.
The pros of the game far outweigh the cons, I just pointed out what stands out to me in particular. Assuming you're a fan of Mecha anime I would highly suggest you consider buying the game and would 100% tell you to buy it on sale.

Hopefully Bandai will bring the next Super Robot Wars to PC internationally again as options in the series for English-speaking fans can be somewhat limited, but it seems English-language options in SRW are becoming a mainstay even if the game isn't released in the west.
If you've had the attention span to read my entire review you clearly have some kind of interest in the game, so I'd suggest picking it up to support the series in the west.

SRW 30 manages to weave together dozens of different anime shows together into a single universe with a coherent, albeit convoluted, story.  The characters all interact with each other in fun and charming ways.  Even the DLC characters will pitch in and get involved in conversations; they don't feel as tacked-on as DLC characters usually are.

SRW30 knows what it is and what it isn't.  It's not a very deep game; its a game about watching all your favorite mechs across dozens of shows fight alongside each other against the combined forces of all their enemies.  It's like fanfic, but with better dialogue.  Despite being a ""tactical"" RPG, there's not a whole lot of strategy to this game; it's a total breeze even on the highest difficulty level, so if you're looking for something like Final Fantasy Tactics then this ain't it.

Game play is solid if you enjoy turn based tactical RPG's.  There are numerous modifiers influencing combat.  Tons of upgrade options for your mecha/ships.

My only complaint would be missing out on the dozens of prior Super Robot Wars (SRW) not released to the USA (disregarding SRW: OG).  You miss out on story bits if you don't field certain mecha for specific battles because certain pilots worked with each another in previous games (which you won't know unless you played the previous games).  The game tries to inform you of previous games events through a keyword selectable highlighted text.  But reading a couple of bland paragraphs doesn't do justice to the massive story and those selectable texts are after-the-fact.  I'm unsure how the developers could have fixed this other than creating a very long recap movie (which I would have loved).  It's a minor quibble but this is the first SRW released to the USA and we missed out on 30 years of plot.

The TL:DR is that, if you are a fan of these shows, you will have an absolute blast despite how simple the gameplay is. You will also likely discover characters/mechs from shows or games you never saw that will make you want to watch them. 

As far as gameplay goes, it's very basic. You move robots from your favorite shows on a grid and attack the enemy, usually taking the form of the enemy grunts/villains from said shows. You have a variety of attacks and most of the strategy revolves around activating abilities which guarantee attacks will hit and miss at the right times.

As basic as it is... it's extremely fun to watch characters (and their machines) from your favorite shows interact with eachother in a semi-official way. I'm given to understand that, for some of these shows, the original creators actually wrote up the scripts for how their characters interact with the game's other characters and I can kind of see that. There is a lot of ""what if this character didn't die?"" factor here as well; it makes me wish you could recruit ""the bad guys"" and face heel turn them from some of these shows. Victory Gundam is the obvious one that comes to mind for that treatment.

What's really great is that the writers mashed together several universes into an 'official, non-official' alternate universe. Victory Gundam happens simultaneously with Majestic Prince, but those damn neo zeon remnants from Char's Counterattack are still lurking around.  For the shows that it doesn't outright pull together into the same timeline, it does the standard ""character x crossed dimensions into a parrallel world now you can recruit him,"" which isn't quite as exciting, but at least it lets you mess around with series that absolutely do not work together, like Sakura Wars and VOTOMS. Going back to the mish mash, the game treats a number of shows as having ""happened"" like Code Geass, GaoGaiGar, and Gundam Unicorn.

It's the first global released, non-original generation game available in english. While a few previous games were available in english they were either with non-crossover mechs or only available through import.

So how does SRW 30 hold up? Poorly really. While the launch bugs have already been smoothed out and the game isn't offensively bad, for all intents and purposes SRW30 has the same exact gameplay and mechanics as the previous three games: V, X, and T.

For the most part, SRW has been more of a fun crossover tactics game, rather than something incredibly hardcore and challenging, but SRW30 is lacking in both aspects.  While V/X/T already suffered from obvious cutbacks compared to previous games (less attacks, less enemy types, boring stage design), SRW30 takes these faults and stretches them over 100 stages of filler. It's new 'semi-free' style of selecting missions hasn't added anything to game but annoying padding.  SRW30 is too long, especially with the extra DLC stages where you will often fight the same exact enemies over and over.

IMO the real star of the show is the bonkers worldbuilding required to cross over like ten core settings and a bunch more peripheral ones, plus the original plot. There are some pretty decent story beats to be found, some ripped straight from the source plots and others organic to the crossover setting.

As a tactical game it's not exactly the best balanced - higher difficulties make spirit commands more necessary to overcome high enemy stats, but spirit commands are so powerful and highly available that this doesn't actually do much to force more tactical thinking and tradeoffs on the player. The system could probably use an overhaul. Enjoyment of the tactical side mostly just boils down to winning all the time and watching the animations play, which for me lasted a while but not through the whole game.

However, while I had the luck of getting the game a few months in (and thus not experiencing some of the more humorous bugs such as V2 Assault Buster (minus it's crotch), The Disappearance of Izuru Hitachi, among others) there are still a few glaring errors in, of all things, the dialogue.

I will say that I haven't played Edge's route yet. Only Az's--but I don't think I should have to play another protagonist entirely just to avoid things like Az getting referred to as a he or the character referring to themselves in the third person during a mission from the expansion pass. Which is clearly a line that was meant for Edge rather than the other way around.

Gameplay-wise, the game's fun!

I finished the game once, and then the third DLC came out. I like the DLC very much so I played the game second time hoping to go through the story again with those new units. In my second play through, I was misled by the preview stage of the DLC3 and thought that my purchase includes the third DLC. 

Another 100 hours and more later, I found out online it takes a seperate purchase to get that. And the dlc cost more around $40. Too greedy, poorly designed DLC promotion in-game, misled me to play the game for a second time over nothing, stage selection mechanism is not self-explanatory, level cap too high that makes level gain meaningless,  too many choices for too few selectable units per stage,  and I really hate the lack of direct explanation on how DLC purchase works in this game.

The game it-self is great. 
Gridman makes no sense, it's not a robot. 
Ultraman has no business being in it too. 
I wish they have included Sazabi after zeon units found out about Char being in the opposing force. 
The character design of AOS survivors is not worthy of feature titles such as Gundam and Mazinger-Z that are classics in the robot sub genre of anime. It's a tasteless disgrace.
It makes no sense in the story that the main force take back the consciousness which betrayed them earlier in late game. 
The fact that the player need to choose all the left choice in order to reach a more preferable ending - it's just bad storytelling. It's choice-matter the element poorly done in practice.
I wish they let us use Shin Getter as an option in late game, but there is no shin-getter despite it being the starring unit of that Getter Robo series.
The transform option is not available for some units that can transform: Getter robo, King J-Der, all Sakura Taisen's units.
Zone of Enders, and Virtual On make more sense than ultraman and gridman.    
All in all it's a good game, I am just too idealistic and too simple minded to truly enjoy how it works. Thank you for reading.

Battle system is largely inherited from SRW V/X/T series with some innovation, but save for a few moments that might call for some careful planning and clever use of spirits, this is largely an all-guns-blazing turned-based RPG lacking challenge, and definitely does not live up to the old legendary titles like SRW F-Final in terms of playability.  The many hours I spent on it is for nostalgia of classic robot anime series, so that's the appeal for that segment of gamers.

If you're a fan of mecha anime, and also enjoy turn-based tactical games, then this is exactly what you're looking for. The plot is something of a whirlwind of different mecha anime plots all spun together into something messy but fun. That plot lacks depth, but it more than makes up for it with the sheer amount of missions and side-quests thrown at you. Characters and mecha aplenty, but you're allowed to pick and choose as you'd like. There's a lot of customization and upgrading involved in making your characters into the best they can be. One thing that really makes the game entertaining is that the attacks all look very pretty. They're just fun to watch. If you don't want to watch them, the game lets you turn off the animations. This greatly speeds up battles.

If I had to pick out a weakness for this game, I'd go with the relative lack of enemy variety. Bosses are given a unique look and special attacks, but you'll probably get bored of seeing regular enemies using the same few attacks, again and again. At least you can skip these animations once you've grown tired of them. Some some the mecha you can use also have relatively few attacks available to them. Yes, the attacks look good, but once you've seen them a bunch, they do get old. The other potential issue is that this game is very complex, and the details matter. Lots of stuff will get thrown at you, from mechs to equipment, and you have to sort through them all to pick out the best. It can be a lot to take in. 

All in all, this game more than delivers on content, fun, and pure nostalgia. Characters from dozens of different mecha anime rub elbows and fight on the same team to save the Earth from an array of threats, with a few original characters thrown in the mix. It can be as easy or as difficult as you'd like with the adjustable difficulty level, and different routes and teams give it strong replay value.

As far as the narrative goes, things aren't looking any better. Of the shows I'm familiar with, the depiction of characters seems poor and lacks much depth of the originals. I can't imagine things are any better for the shows I haven't seen. And the overall plot is even worse, with no thematic cohesion leading to a bad fanfic style of storytelling that doesn't make it worth reading the large amount of dialogue. Perhaps that's an inherent flaw of this kind of crossover game but then I think emphasising the characters over worldbuilding would go a long way.

There were missions in the old games that I would just get by on the skin of my teeth and took some real strategy to beat.

If you're not familiar with the SRW franchise, don't let the tactical grid and cutscene images fool you: Once you get to the battles, this is where the sheer beauty and awesomeness of this game really pushes through to epic levels, and it has always been this franchise's strong point as far back as the PS2 era.

With this entry, the only thing that I can mention as a minor complaint is the fact that a few of the units have lower frames of animation (Gridman especially). This really becomes noticeable once you put other attack animations next to them side by side. But it's not enough of a big deal to be a huge deterrence to what these attack animations deliver.

Sound: 5/5
Oh jeez, the music never gets old with these entries. If you're a newcomer, you'll chill with the music that normally plays through the scenario cutscenes, but once you hit the battlefield with your unit of choice? Oh man, you won't stop jamming. This is especially felt if you have the premium music track. Voice acting is top notch as expected, as all the voice actors reprise their roles from the anime series they come from.

Gameplay: 5/5
Put the unit out on the field, select attack, watch amazing cutscene, enemy unit goes boom boom or whack it with several units until it goes boom boom.

Its simple RTS, but it works absolutely well. And if you want to flesh it out even more, you can in between missions by switching out eligible pilots to different units, use upgrade items and much more. The fact that there are multiple branching paths also add to the replayability ten times fold; And the DLC just stacks upon that even moreso. In other words, this game gives you PLENTY to do and never feels boring while you're playing.

Story: 4/5
The story can get a bit convoluted if you're not careful, but it's nowhere near as difficult to follow as you'd assume. Knowledge of the anime series being rep'd isn't needed, but be forewarned; This franchise is known to be a gateway for many into the Super and Real Robot genres in anime. If, for example, you're coming into this only knowing about Gridman but never heard of J-Decker or GaoGaiGar, prepare to have your interests in these series possibly perk up enough to where you may want to hunt down an episode of two or 10 of these series.

Difficulty: Easy
There are options to bump up the difficulty if you're looking for something that gives you a far bigger challenge, but don't expect to find the most nail biting RTS here; This isn't what the franchise is about. Fun is it's primary objective here.

BOTTOM LINE:
5/5
I have been a fan of the SRW fanchise since I discovered a commercial online advertising SRW Alpha 2.  Since then, I have always hoped and dreamed that perhaps a time would come where the franchise would come overseas, despite having a copyright legal nightmare in it's DNA. I am honestly so happy that it's finally here and that people have or will discover this series for the first time.

As you unlock an increasing number of much-cooler-than-your-own Robots which indeed feel 'Super' you will feel that you Main Character and its Robot are only being dragged along and rather should be thrown into the trash bin.

The rest of the game is being told by static pictures and textboxes. I could have that too in Front Mission 1-5 from almost 20 years ago but which had fully customizeable robots including visibly different parts, visibly different weapons and even various rocket launchers as well as active skills that changed animations / outcome mid-battle dynamically.

Edit: With the Front Mission 1st Remake on the horizon, any similar game will be compared to it for very good reasons. With the updated graphics of the remake, I now rate SRW30 a 0/10.

For a quick example, watch this clip here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAQkDPAbKgw

I am ok with recycled assets, as long as you improve on it, or at least, in the very minimum, not take stuff away when you've already had everything baked into the game. And might I add, 3 years ago. (The clip above is comparison between SRW X and SRW 30)

Despite this being the 30th anniversary, there's nothing in particular that stands out from all the previous gens. The 'somewhat' open world nature of approaching mission might have been something but it's not affecting the story-line much at all. You still can do secret / hidden objectives to obtain more pilots / robots just like before, and you still have the whole secret true ending after completing certain criteria (usually kill count along with some point based dialog system)

I am all for reduce, reuse, recycle, BANDAI NAMECO, but this is ridiculous.

EDIT: As of January 29, 2022 I also see that SRW 30 have changed their thumbnail to include the glaring '90% POSITIVE REVIEWS' on their game store thumbnail. I don't know how many folks here are rating the game positive from nostalgia, or if it's simply because this is their first SRW series released on steam. But I find this stunt heavily on-the-nose.

Well they already got my money ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ But if you are honestly looking for a good SRW game might I suggest SRX:BX (on 3DS) with more robots to play with, and some additional style of combat like teaming robots into a group to fight instead of just 1v1 the entire time.

Super Robot Wars 30 is an extremely polished version of the games we all know and love with a new non-linear progression system that lets you choose what happens next in the story. Go get your favorite characters first if you want to; the game won't stop you! Dialogue changes depending on what routes you take, which makes this game RIPE for replays. 

Tons of characters, awesome attack animations, and great character customization allowing for pretty much any build you could think of. Atop that, if you don't think the music in the game is good enough, you can also put in custom music to assign to the characters. 

I have two minor criticisms; one is that the Getter Robo stuff in the game feels very much like an afterthought. You get handed Shin Getter Dragon near immediately, the Invaders are just there as extra mooks, and to top it all off, the Shin Dragon (the Armageddon one, not the Daikessen one) doesn't function as a battleship anymore. It really feels like the devs wanted Getter Robo ARC, but couldn't do it because the anime was still in production. 

My other criticism is that there really is no point to chasing the secret involving getting the other protagonist in the main game because they have no dialogue beyond the initial unlock. The Expansion Pack fixes this, but it's still egregious. 

However, those are minor nitpicks to an otherwise stellar game. If you're a mecha anime fan this is a MUST BUY, especially for all the DLC that add in even more series. I cannot recommend this game enough.",1650387974,1650387974,True,3,0,0.470046073198318481,0,True,False,False

Stay away from this game until they fix it, as a fan, as a gamer. My disappointment is immeasurable and my game is ruined. 

On a side note i'm going to say ""trust me i tried"" to any possible solutions, verifying game files, not using the units, just not using spirit in general, Reinstalling the game. I have done all i can on my end besides making a mod, and i don't know how to do that so that's out too.

You don't really even have to understand all the mechanics to have a good grasp of the gameplay flow, and even on the hardest (non-DLC added) difficulties, they don't usually pose much of a challenge without self imposed restrictions.

SRW30 is along the same lines, and even more so due to a mechanic change (no more SR points). If you are looking at buying this to play an engaging strategy RPG, there are several other games in the genre that will probably suit your tastes in a more satisfying way. 

However, if you are a Mecha Anime fan to any degree (which I, unashamedly, am), then playing SRW games often feel like a Nirvana like experience. You get much more out of it if you are familiar, or even curious about the myriad of Robot Amime properties featured in each game, and even if you aren't, there's a handy encyclopedia/character glossary that will get you up to speed with the cliff notes of what goes on with each amine featured. 

The plot of the games basically boil down to being the world's most professionally done fanfiction crossover. There's lots of flashy attacks and cut in scenes that you could watch on YouTube to get a taste of, but the people who mainly buy these games are the ones which hear about giant anime robots, and think it sounds awesome (which is a surprisingly large niche considering these games have been continuously released for 30 years, hence the ""30"" in SRW30.)

Distinct about SRW30, is that as an anniversary title, it has a lot of homages to classic games throughout the series history. It's something I appreciate personally, as I was first introduced to SRW years ago in high school by randomly coming across SRW4, and played a few others on and off since. The 2nd distinct thing is that, on Steam at least, this is the first licensed SRW game to be officially available for purchase outside of Asian territories (previous SRW games have technically reached this milestone earlier, but feature wholly original characters. Others have been fully translated into English, but not officially sold in non-Asian territories). Months later, it's surreal to me that I was just able to buy this game without jumping through any import hoops to do it, the worst of which is all the stuff I had to do to play SRW Alpha back on PlayStation. I only hope that this will become the norm going forward, based on sales and whatnot.

If you are even remotely curious about the world of Mecha Anime and the like, it is a must purchase.",1650153934,1650154064,True,1,0,0.500362098217010498,0,True,False,False

Normally, rating a SRW for me is fairly simple, as most SRW games fall into a fairly generic pattern, so the ones with more care in their construction shine more than the ones with less care.  But 30 ignores a lot of conventional structures the franchise falls into to attempt a bunch of new things.  It... does not do them well, much like how Neo (the last extremely unconventional SRW) failed to do its thing very well, but it is at least clear that a goodly amount of effort went into it, even if it doesn't feel placed all that well at times.

If you're looking for an SRPG, I would not recommend this.  By the standards of the genre I'd say it's probably not all that good of a game, as it suffers from the many issues most SRWs do with the added issue of being significantly longer than one and thus wearing on the player much earlier.  If you're looking for a crossover game, however, SRW has always been essentially the peak of the mountain when it comes to crossovers, because there's really no other crossover out there that handles the storylines of its constituent series quite like SRW does.  30 is... not the best at this (if you want another SRW that's better at handling its plots, try W), but it is still notably good.",1649796278,1649796278,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I discovered SRW purely by chance - a random youtube video caused me to find a short clip from one of the SRW: Original Generations OVAs of Sanger cleaving an army with one stroke. That sent me down a spiraling rabbit hole of clips of the games, etc, and eventually learning they existed here in english on the GBA. From then on, I was absolutely hooked. I loved watching clips from the games, even if they were in japanese, so when Moon Dwellers was announced for an english importable release, I was STOKED. Loved it, finished it multiple times.

So now here we are at SRW 30, and this game is amazing. If you are a fan of the series, it's a love letter. Big robots, big numbers, big... well, everything. I love it, the game is over the top, and it's introduced me to several series I didn't even know were a thing.

Being able to form an army of giant anime robots and fight across the universe is the raddest idea ever. When I found out a Super Robot Wars game was finally getting a legit release in my country, I was really psyched.

And mostly, the game was a lot of fun. Getting to learn the robots abilities and deploying them in a smart way was cool. Seeing them progress and get upgraded robots was fun too, and using the money you won to make your best robots into powerhouses was really rewarding. Seeing a couple shows I was a fan of, like Gridman, Magic Knight Rayearth and Voltes V, was awesome. Of course, I also learned about some cool-looking shows I want to watch thanks to seeing them in this game, like J-Decker.

But I have to say if this game has a weakness, it's that's too much stuff's in it. There's more available robots than you could possibly ever use, since you only get to use so many per mission. By the end of the game I had trouble sometimes using mostly the same group in most missions. The ones I'd built a lot of levels and bought a lot of stat upgrades for. I can barely imagine how much worse it'd be if I hadn't been focused and I'd spread those out over the 50+ robots you can pick from instead.

Also, the game tries to include the plot of multiple shows, and by the end I was getting really sick of it. A lot of players probably really liked getting to fight the main villains of their favorite robot anime, but I've never seen some of the shows in this game. And I just wasn't invested in all of them or their plots. No matter how many times the game stopped cold in the middle of a level to spend 20-40 text boxes trying to involve me in somebody's story. Seriously. Some later missions just WOULDN'T END with all the dialogue between a dozen characters I barely knew. By then I'd fought a whole bunch of bad guys with armies of robots and superweapons after getting partway into the game, and I was starting to not to care about who each one was, why they were doing it, and with what mecha.

So I'm gonna say in the end, SRW 30 is a pretty good game. As long as you don't care about the story.",1647802129,1647813653,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Another thing to note is that KB+M is not recommended.

At least i can avoid of mistakenly killing an opponent without using てかげん command. But still frustating that a few character can learn spirit commands above their initial SP(that red haired operator brat really give me trouble in enabling 祝福 command)

The Support Chara system also give a various way of building more powerful team build with active support which can act as another spirit command and passive support which acts as a permanent upgrade when placed.

The ship upgrading seems very tiring but you it's not a big deal if you're an idiot who purposely grind the ship upgrading points using upgrade part which increases the upgrade points the more you move the units which had the parts placed on it.

The game also surprisingly light for an over 10Gb volume game which my relatively inferior PC can keep up with stable 60FPS(although it might be different if i enter a map with lots of unit).

Aside from gameplay performance, i actually very satisfied with the licensed rosters. The Combattler V finally reappears after a long break from console with new animations and it also includes the fellow Romance Series Voltes V as DLC. Getter Robo also amuse me when i heard it uses Getter Dragon as main unit since it's pretty sad that the True Getter Robo jumped from Getter Robo to Shin Getter Robo because Getter Dragon became the Getter 1's stepping stone(RIP).

I find myself unable to open other games, mostly thanks to it's anime like pacing and desire to break things into very digestible portions. Unlike other games, SRW 30 seems content with any pace I want to take. It's stuffed with a large amount of content, but doesn't want you to rush thru it. It's a game that wants you to savor every attack animation or dialog line. I think it may be the Stockholm talking but I like being able watch the pretty robot explosions and not have to be breaking my thumbs like some recent giant robot related games. The plot is like 15 different anime in a blender. It juggles plot lines like a circus performer on cocaine, but never seems to drop a plate. I find myself rather invested in the roller coaster.

If you like giant robots then you will definitely like this game and I've grown to like certain series just off these games themselves. It is a strategy game but there really isn't much strategy imo. Just like any other SRW game, you basically just need to use like 5 spirit commands to get through each mission (persist, flash, valor, bullseye, intuition etc). By the middle of the game, I had upgraded my Hyaku Shiki Kai unit to max with some additional parts to improve movement, accuracy, and evasion and he literally could beat missions by himself while my 13-14 units sit in the back and do nothing. 
       It took around 80 hours for me to beat the game and there is a lot of reading and dialogue between the beginning of the missions and after, so if you don't mind that then you are good. You can have the option to just focus on the main missions to progress the story or you can do a bunch of side missions (which some can come back after completing which is good for farming money.) The animations for units vary, some are pretty detailed and some aren't (some are animated a certain way to keep the style of that anime too). I didn't have any bug issues or crashes either.

It feels like an honest callback to mecha and super lifeform anime of the past, with everything from small and nimble Gundams to large and durable gestalt super robots, which fall into roughly one of three categories - nimble, all-round, and bastion.  Nimble units rely on being able to dodge the enemy and chip away at them.

This game, while having perhaps fewer must-watch anime series represented in its roster, has a really brilliant open-ended structure that keeps you engaged no matter what. It opens up at several points and lets you choose which order to play the stages in, so you can collect some of your favorite mechs for your team before moving on to the stages you have less interest in. And beyond that, so much of the scenes adapt to include dialog from whichever characters you have on your team at any given time.

The strategy component is great and the entire game makes you feel like you're watching and directing your own ultimate mecha anime. They have so many mecha anime series crossing over from flagship series like Gundam to classics like Mazinger, to even more recent series. (I just wish Macross was one of them especially since this is an anniversary game but with the IP rights between BIG WEST and Harmony Gold being an absolute nightmare what can you do? But hey, now that they both finally settled and let Macross and Robotech coexist, to the point Macross finally started coming over in the west, hopefully next SRB we can see Macross make it's triumphant return. Maybe even with a Macross vs Robotech subplot)

My only complaint is that the game is on Windows only and doesn't have a Mac or Linux version, especially with the Steam Deck coming soon.

Sure we're having to pay for the Hi Nu Gundam, a suit that was literally in the story of the last 2 games and wasn't paid DLC, but we're getting Sakura Taisen, so I can look past it. Still has Sakura Taisen, so I don't know what more you want from me. Granted the extremely lazy midi song they used for Sakura Taisen was.... disappointing to put it mildly, but you can import your own songs which is an easy fix.

Edit: I know I already mentioned the midi music for the DLC but man it is pretty atrocious. I still can't get over how terrible the midi track they used for Sakura Taisen. It's sooooooooooooo lazy. I was both surprised and not surprised to see that they didn't bother doing each theme for the Sakura Taisen 1, 3 and 5 characters which they did do in Project X Zone 1 and 2 but.... whatever. 

Actual other things to add: PC controls for this game are pretty terrible, wasd moves the cursor without moving the screen itself which is awkward. Mouse controls feel more like they're for an RTS than a turn based strategy. I don't even know where all the keys are. I honestly just gave up and went back to controller which was disappointing as I was looking forward to playing this with mouse and keyboard. 

The black screen that happens in between attack animations is a huge immersion killer for me. The battles don't feel like attack and response anymore so much as just two separate attacks that happen at.... some point. In previous games a unit would attack, you would see the results happen to the attacked unit and then the attacked unit would respond with their own attack all in what looked like 1 seamless animation. But these black screens that happen in between attacks really kills the flow of the battle animations. This may not bother some people but it bothers me a lot with how noticeable it is. 

Also adding the Hi Nu Gundam as dlc was a really..... well disappointing move. The Hi Nu Gundam was just part of the story for both X and T and it seems extremely.... lazy after having it in the last two games to make it a DLC unit for 30th when it could've just been in the game.",1635400928,1644082719,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a stunning turn based strategy RPG with heavy mecha/gundam anime story elements between maps. Pilots and mechs can be upgraded separately and swapped to the player's liking, this time around you can even upgrade various parts of your carrier ship as well which is where most of the dialogue between missions takes place. 
Overall Super Robot Wars 30 should appeal to anyone remotely into Super Sentai, Tokusatasu or SRPGs in general.

With an SRPG-type gameplay that is very reminiscent of Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics.
----------

However, the user interface is clunky and awkward. 
The pacing of gameplay is incredibly slow.

To the point that even with me holding down my double-click mouse button to skip dialogue at record speed, and not dawdling, it still took over 30 minutes to finish the very first mission (with only 5 enemy units total).
Not because of difficulty (I was on beginner mode), but because it takes SOOO long for units to move, to select attack options, and turns to change.
-----------

The biggest turn-off for me was the fact the devs pulled two dirty tricks.

One... it is impossible to adjust any settings from the main menu, including audio volume or gameplay mechanics.
The only options that can be changed are the 3 graphics options (fullscreen/windowed; Anti-aliasing; and resolution), and certain keybinds.
Anything else, you have to sit through 5 minutes of cutscenes, battle prep, in-game dialogue, and the start of the player phase before you're allowed to access System Settings.

The Second thing they did... is to auto-black out Screenshots.
No snapping pictures for you, player. No showing how you did, no showing funny moments that made you laugh. 
Nothing.
(I've been told this auto-blackout censoring continues until you reach the 5th mission, but I'm not willing to play that far to verify that, especially as that will absolutely push me past my 2-hour refund window)
---------

I'll admit, the fact that they pushed several screens, demanding that I consent to share information with them (with a half-hearted promise to be allowed to withdraw my consent later) also raised some of my red flags... but whether such things bother you is up to you.

[hr] [/hr]

This was an impressive feat of franchise licensing, finally allowing this series to be allowed to be released outside Japan.
However, that does not compensate for the game's flaws.

In conclusion, this game has a clunky, slow interface. 
It locks you out of settings, and blacks out screenshots.

In general, despite enjoying series like Gundam, Ultraman, and Code Geass... I cannot recommend this game.

In Alpha you has a shop you could buy items from whereas here they're just pre-set drops. one thing that's weird is how they're save system  has stayed the same over the years. you can save at an intermission and load that file from the ""Load"" option on the menu, or you can ""Suspend"" mid battle and ""Continue"" from the main menu. i just don't get why that hasn't been modernized yet, and on top of that there's no auto saving when there really could be.
writing this review at 40 hrs, no where near done, but im at a point playing on normal where i feel like i have to bump the difficulty up a bit. i know from alpha that there will be a point where difficulty will spike, but i speced into weapon upgrades first, and leveled the mechs up to compliment their preexisting strengths and i feel a bit over powered. this is of course with playing all available missions and DLC. so just something to consider, i play 40k IRL, and this has no where near the grand strategy of that or Kill Team even, so don't expect enemy leadership to outsmart you on normal.

If only the steam version have a demo so people who are unfamiliar with the Super Robot Wars  series would actually get a taste and see if they like it. 

There's more to this game than blowing stuff up. The mech and pilot customization has been revamped from it's predecessor Super Robot Wars T as the process of upgrading your mechs and pilots and making them god-like broken is more fun in my opinion. The unique battleship customization in SRW 30 is also a very good addition for the series. 

In terms of story and plot well... it's a hodge podge of plots from different mecha anime series so don't expect it to make any sense even if the script writers and translators tried their best. 

As a strategy rpg it's not the most complex but it has it's own unique systems and mechanics that won't make sense to the person unfamiliar with the series and might require them to look for a guide. But once you figure those out this game is a lot of fun so don't let that discourage you from trying this it's not as hard as it sounds. 

In terms of overall roster I would say the previous game Super Robot Wars T is better in that regard but that's just a matter of preference and the cast that they chose for 30 is good too. 

It's great that this underrated gem of a series is getting more exposure in the western market and despite a few bad bugs (which they fixed some already) overall the people who played it seems to like it.

I've been a long-time fan of the series, but unable to play most of it due to the language barrier.  Somehow, this has culminated into a mainline Super Robot Wars title actually receiving a Western release.  To say I'm shocked would be an understatement, and even months later it still doesn't feel particularly real.

The very real SRW 30 definitely doesn't disappoint, taking many of the mechanics from the VXT trilogy and refining them while putting their own spin on things.  The new mecha often don't disappoint, and many of the old ones have received upgrades in terms of animation, abilities, and more.  I'd like to give a special shoutout in particular to Mazinger, which had a really poor showing in SRW T, but really shine in 30.  Mazin go indeed.

Another thing of note, which may be a good or bad thing, is how lengthy the game is.  The game is jam-packed full of content, with a very open-ended approach to things, allowing you to prioritize the series that you want to recruit from(And even skip some for a while, although they'll inevitably end up joining you anyway).  It's no surprise that, given how long this game can be, that an auto-mode was implemented to help speed through battles when desired(That being said, the auto mode leaves a lot to be desired, sadly.  I've glanced over multiple times and seen my allies just stop right in front of an enemy with no attack).

The roster this time around is pretty solid, with a bit of something for everyone, and many secrets are there to discover, too.  People who played T will likely be pleased by a certain series finally gets the respect it deserves in that regard.  In regards to writing around the roster, I felt that everyone got a good amount of dialogue and interaction with the story, although some can get pretty grating(Looking at you, Ernie).

The gameplay is overall very solid, much of it is the same as the VXT trilogy, but refined and balanced. One thing in particular is that, thanks to the length of the game, a lot of ""support"" units(Such as Umi and Fuu from Rayearth, or the Shrike team from Victory) have a lot more opportunities to stand out, and get stronger.  Despite never hitting level cap before in an SRW game, I've actually hit the cap on pretty much everyone that I've been using(40+ units) without grinding, which is great for certain characters who didn't catch up to protagonists until far too late in the game.

I actually don't really have any complaints about SRW 30.  The game pretty much hit all my expectations and then some.  If you want a strategy RPG that's a great love letter to mecha, then 30 will definitely fulfill that need.",1643021110,1643021110,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For now, I recommend it to anyone interested. This is also likely the most beginner friendly SRW yet, with a gentle easing curve and many hints for things that should be obvious but may not occur to someone who's never played a S/T RPG before.

For returning SRW players, here are some key notes if you haven't taken a deep dive yet:

- As a B.B. Studio SRW, it's a bit on the easier side so far like the last three (on normal).
- Open Mission structure with minor exploration elements!
   - Pick Super or Real starting route
   - Plot involves building up battleship by getting into SRW style nonsense around the world
   - Mission select lets you choose which units to go for first; there seems to be some variation in story elements in stages
       based on what you do in what order.
   - Map screen has extra patrol missions (free XP and other benefits for two random[?] pilots) instead of the old training 
      rooms
   - Map screen also has relic missions for power parts, they are mostly difficult puzzle maps where you'll need your best 
      units or system mastery to win. Sending my weakest units, they ended up quickly over-leveled with careful play if they 
      were capable of completing it. They don't scale, speaking of which...
   - Scaling in most(?) battles, not sure how it works exactly but so far balance feels just like most more recent SRW's (on 
      normal) 
    - Map screen has another bonus for exploration, a rare fairy that grants some benefit (hasn't appeared for me yet).
    - TacP and other system upgrades replaced by MxP which is spent on the battleship. Some things provide good passive 
      bonuses or economy discounts like other BB Studio SRW, but others affect the ship directly like doing full damage on 
      some support attacks, giving it the repair system, and more.
    - Optional chats from achievements, ace celebrations, and sim missions are back but accessed from a new tab in 
       the mission screen. The ship itself and main character take up the Sidekick/Pet role from past BB SRW games.
    - Supporters are back but now include passive bonuses if set, altering rewards, ExC costs and more.
    - Ship repair/EN restock is faster than most SRW, I don't recall rates from last three but I think base rate is 50% a turn 
       based on upgrade path information; closer to G Generations boarding.
    - Ship can recover from adjacent tile in addition to units boarding.
    - Base ExC costs reworked.
    - The orchestral reworks of classic SRW scenario and map tracks are great.

Cons:
   - The UI in general favors aesthetic over readability (matching the ship design) and takes a little bit to adjust to. It is 
      arguably more functional than past iterations outside of the visuals themselves, once you become accustomed to 
      looking at it.
   - Some of the early stages are a little too generic for their introduction, the tutorial is essentially a couple hours long. 

Early impressions in, I'd heartily recommend it for anyone looking to jump into SRW, who likes giant robots at all, or even just a healthy interest in SRPG's.

UPDATE 1: Almost 200 hours in and still haven't beaten the game. 10/10",1635489390,1642983393,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I personally think that the T, V and X editions on the switch are better and it’s easy to see why this is the first installment EVER available to the west as the scope of franchise represented is more narrows (as far as IP holders and Brands Represented) and much like other version focused mostly on Bandai and Namco owned properties but this seems to lean heaver twords that then the other recent releases. In the end It’s a new story but ultimately more of the same. However, given your going to pay through the roof for those switch imports this is a good option to get your Super Robot Wars fix.

If you have never played a game in this series it's a turn based strategy game similar to games like Into the Breach, X-Com, Fire Emblem and the original Front Mission games. The draw of this series is that it features a massive crossover of many, many mecha and sci-fi anime franchises. The stories aren't the strongest and that goes for this entry as well despite the fact that unless you skip the dialog before and after battles you will spend at least 10-20 minutes reading mostly pointless visual novel style dialog for each mission. With the possibility for more, sometimes much, much more in battle dialog.

Despite that if your a fan of this type of strategy game you can often field many more units on much larger battlefields then in most, the game has many little sub challenges you can perform during missions, upgrade mecha and pilots in a variety of ways to suit their strengths combined with your preferred play style, and overall it’s a more then solid entry in this genre. And on that I recommend it.

If you're a fan of Sci-Fi and Mecha anime especially from the 90s golden age of anime then I definitely recommend it.

The Good
- Lovingly animated 2d that mimics the style of the original source material.
- Gameplay starts off easy, but offers a decent depth for min maxing.
- Special side missions with puzzle-like mechanics that force you to exploit the game's mechanics to succeed.
- In-game library to explain the component anime series and their terminology to those unfamiliar them.
- Story does a generally good job of blending several stories from different franchises together into a seamless whole. The non-DLC characters aren't some interdimensional travelers. They are part of a living, breathing world.

The Bad
- 30fps locked. This can be forgiven a bit since it's hand-animated.
- The same faithfulness to the source material can be jarring at times such as the (deliberately) choppy animation of the RX-78-2 Gundam.
- Super Expert starts tough, but even then can get too easy too fast.
- Some franchises are just there, and barely contribute to the overall plot.
- Forced story repositioning in missions can frequently leave critical units exposed to precarious positions without support. In the worst case, they are dragged along to the other side of the map.

Verdict: Overall, yes.

As a whole, a not particularly difficult SRPG, similar to Fire Emblem, that places more emphasis on fanservice and flashy animations.

The story isn't particularly hard to follow if you watched the component anime series before: Simply mash most of the stories together and blend them together, and throw in an overarching original story to tie the whole thing together. With that said, some of the series such as Zeta Gundam, and Char's Counterattack barely have a plot presence since their story is already over, and are simply tagging along for the wild ride.

If you have NOT watched any of the component series, fear not, for the game supplies an in-game library that you can read at your leisure, giving an overview of the relevant plot of each series, biographies of every single named character, and even highlights story references which can be viewed in more detail on what exactly just happened.

In terms of gameplay, the game gives tips and an in-game manual to explain various systems. The early missions also eases you in to the various unique mechanics in the game, such as their Extra Orders and Supporter system. While it won't cover every single mechanic, it gives out enough to play the game well enough.

Difficulty-wise, as mentioned it's not particularly difficult for most part. Easy mode should be for those completely unfamiliar with SRPGs, and normal is a good balance at learning the mechanics and providing a challenge. Hard felt good for those familiar with SRPGs, while Expert provided a bit more of a challenge. Super Expert is aimed at hardcore fans and will actually be challenging enough to force players to use various quirks and unique systems the game has to offer. 

No, the real challenges come in the form of accomplishing feats such as destroying an enemy that would normally run away when it's at low health, and being rewarded with an otherwise rare item and a boatload of cash for the trouble. Or certain side missions pitting a choice of, say, 3 or 4 units, sometimes just one, against an overwhelmingly large force, and having to destroy them within a tight time limit.

Aesthetically, the 3d graphics aren't particularly special, and is light enough to run on weaker machines. Instead, emphasis is on the lovingly made 2d animations that mimics the source material as closely as possible. It goes so far as having older series such as the original Gundam and Combattler V having retro anime-style sounds and choppy animation reminiscent of the 80s era, while newer series, such as Narrative Gundam and Code Geass, tend to have smoother animations and cleaner lines like modern animation.

All-in all, highly recommended if you're a fan of Japanese mecha anime, or just want to play something comfy. SRPG fans looking for a challenge may at least want to start the game on Expert right out of the gate, or else look elsewhere.",1641830969,1641987823,True,23,0,0.716028809547424316,3,True,False,False

Writing this review after beating it after 76 hours. This game was probably my GOTY 2021, I've loved this series since SRW J got an english patch for the GBA 15 years ago, and I've been wanting an officially translated SRW game for ages. Luckily for me, I'm pretty happy with what I got.
[h2]Should I play it?[/h2]
It really depends on how much you like robots and mecha. This game is way too easy even on the hardest difficulty to appeal as a tactical turn based RPG, this game is the digital equivalent of slamming your cool robot toys together and pretending they're fighting, but [i]man[/i] does it do it well. The combat animations are gorgeous and the remixed music of each series respective openings are dope as hell.

If you have an appreciation for robots at all, every new unit and series you're introduced to is a real joy to discover, between the cool combat animations and the solid writing and dialogue of these different series coming together, it's a real fun time even if you're not into each respective series.

Even if you're new to the shows represented, if what you see interests you, you'll have a great time. The writing hits a sweet spot where somebody new to them can appreciate these characters interacting, but long time fans are rewarded by their characters being well represented and interacting with characters from entirely different series in logical and hilarious ways.

And another benefit, playing SRW is one of the premier way to find mecha series to watch that aren't total dogshit, SRW [i]RARELY[/i] misses the mark on getting cool series in. Every show represented in this game especially is worth the watch.

So should you play it? Well, if you watch any of the combat animations and get hyped, jump in. If the combat animations don't look good to you, go elsewhere. This is a game that lives or dies on its theme and presentation.",1641613587,1641613587,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I first saw the advertisement for Super Robot Wars 30, I transported to the time of my childhood when I had toy robots.  I simulated mock battles with all my different toy robots.  That is the essence of this game.
I started playing Super Robot Wars in the late 2000s and it was all in Japanese.  The series is a turned based tactical JRPG. 
 If you have played Tactics Ogre or FF Tactics, you get the drift.  Once you learned the menus and battle interface, it was a breeze.  What broke the mold for me was when an English subtitled Super Robot Wars V (Space Battleship Yamato aka Star Blazers) released in other Asian countries.  I can now understand the crazy story and the battle flow better.  Now, what is so special about this new entry Super Robot Wars 30... everything.
This game was carefully crafted to commemorate 30 years of SRW.  They did an outstanding job!  The selection of the series and animating the action sequences are top notch.  It has it all!

Brooding heroes... check!
Hot Blooded heroes... check!
Crazy action sequences... check!
Fantastic music with said action sequences... check!
Awesome 80s hair... check!  Looking at you Heavy Metal L-Gaim.

The crowning achievement is the DLCs.  The DLCs for this game is the best out of many games I have played and worth the price.  For the first time, I was able to get the premium soundtrack for the action sequences.  All sung by the original artists.  Heaven for me.  I purchased the Ultimate Edition and never looked back.
For the new comers to this beloved franchise, it is NOT necessary to have seen all of the mecha series portrayed in the game.  The stories are so out of control, looking at you Mr. Gundam creator Yoshiyuki Tomino, that you will be spinning your wheels.  The game has done a great job of cutting out the unnecessary dialogue while weaving together the greater narrative.  If further clarification is required because you have become fully vested in the individual series, the game contains a Library that outlines all characters and mecha.
Is this game worth your time?  Yes!  With the DLC, it is a long game so I can take my time and fully enjoy it.  My favorite units are from the SRW OG series.  Some of the best!

As such I have revised my review. Fun game, but they need to work on their customer service side. I never did convince their tech support that it wasn't my computer that was at fault. Their tech is low level tech support hell. Anyways I will end on the note that now that I can play again I am enjoying the game greatly.


Normally I don't like throwing out a negative for a bug, particularly since they have patched the Red 5 missing bug(even if I would have hoped for a faster turnover on that one) while keeping us informed. Unfortunately I am one of those plagued by the spirit crash bug and it has rendered the game pretty much unplayable for me. I can't really recommend a game that I can't play because it frequently crashes. At this point it seems like my only option would be to start a fresh game all over and just toss out 100+ hours of gameplay. 

You might be okay if you are a new player, a lot of speculation is that the spirit crashing is a result of having continued to play after the original Red 5 missing bug and/or having used the [solution] to that bug that had been in their news post. So someone that buys right now might very well be fine. But I can't guarantee it and thus for now am leaving a no.",1637966840,1640456538,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you enjoy Mech anime/manga of all types this is a great mix and mash of some of the different shows. If you enjoy the fire emblem tile combat and you enjoy mechs this is great game for you. There are so many missions to chose from other than the base story missions. Not only that some missions (including story prerequisites) are locked behind certain pilot criteria. As one, I had to shoot down 120 enemy combatants with one particular pilot before i could get to the next part of the story. There are side missions and some nice little flavour stories that you can do if you fulfill other different criteria. Yes you can select the gender of your Protag, and they do have different personalities. 

there are some downsides however which i suggest to look out for:

1.     You cannot replay maps in your current game playthrough. This also includes the scenes that happen before or after, so if you're like me and you have a very invasive pet or you accidentally skip things, you will be SOL unless you restart from a brand new save, or if you save before hand and reload it and go through the battle process again.

2.     While both protags have different personalities that's, for the most part, there is very little distiction made of them in the scenes. There times when they mention how cute the fem!Pro is, but a few times in the main story they seemingly forget there is a fem!protag and goes to mention default Male!protag. So while there are quite a few times in the side stories where their differences are made, the main story was obvious spear headed and written for the Male!Protag as the second was left as an afterthought from the feel of it.",1640450533,1640450533,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

You don't actually need to know the lore of the series that appear, and in fact SRW has been credited with being a gateway for people to get introduced to new anime they'd never seen before. In addition, SRW is famous for including both older series (e.g. in this game you have 1976's Combattler V) and newer ones (this game has 2018's SSSS Gridman). 

SRW 30 in particular is quite beginner friendly, with several repeatable missions that are outright described as being for grinding purposes (traditionally, the only way to grind was to lose a mission and restart, since that allowed you to keep your earned money and XP). In addition, where traditionally SRW is linear with only a few route selections here and there (e.g. the heroes splitting between a Space Route and an Earth Route for a few missions), SRW 30 instead allows you to pick and choose the missions you want to do in between the story missions. 

Furthermore, you don't actually need to know the lore of the various series of a SRW, since the stories will be different due to the crossover aspect. For example, in this game, the events of Code Geass are mentioned as happening at the same time as Char's Counterattack in the backstory. It's always interesting to see how series will be integrated with each other, like how some villains and heroes from different series will be acquainted with each other. This is reflected in the battle dialogue, when characters will acknowledge each other (e.g. a Gundam character will comment on how tough a Kikaiju from Mazinger is or heroes normally have unique dialogue when facing a series' Big Bad). 

Music wise, generally a series will use the theme song in instrumental form (though if you splurge on the more expensive versions of this game, you get vocal tracks as well). However, if the music provided doesn't suit your tastes, like many recent SRW games SRW 30 allows you to load your own music as well. You can even set different music for each attack, making it possible to set, say, Main Title for most of Nu Gundam's attacks but setting the more dramatic Beyond The Time for the most powerful attacks for dramatic purposes.

For SRW 30, 2 DLC packs have been announced (as of this writing, DLC2 will be released later this evening). This allows them to introduce some other series, though the fact that they're DLC means that you won't really see how their stories would've integrated with those of other series. As an example, DLC unit Voltes V (pronounced Five) is outright described as an alternate version of Combattler V rather than being brother machines like in games where the two are part of the story from the start. The DLC characters do at least have battle dialogue that's newly recorded, like the Sakura Wars cast commenting on how a kaiju from Gridman resembles demons from their own world.

I actually held off on writing a review until I completed my first playthrough, and I already want to start my second one. Part of the reason for this is because the protagonist you choose does affect things like how characters interact with you (e.g. I noticed that the male protagonist gets scolded a lot more than the female protagonist due to his more abrasive nature).

Now for the review. It carries the ExC mechanic from V/X/T over, and standard SRW game-play is pretty obvious. Animations are clean, music is fantastic, and the game runs perfectly well(though I've had a few crashes on specific stages, fixed with a restart usually). What sets this game apart is its semi linear structure. This is what makes this game *really* interesting, being able to tackle stages in a not so linear manner. Now of course some stages only become available after some progress, but always in batches. So you'll always have around 6ish stages per story chunk to go through at your leisure, as well as multiple side stages, some of which can be indefinitely repeated, making upgrading much less stressful at times if you put in the effort.

== LAZY WRITING THAT COULD CONFUSE NEWCOMERS ==

The franchise seems to be adamant about using the idea of ""Travelling across worlds"" after the inception such idea starting in Super Robot Wars K. I guess they had used up all ideas for that after Super Robot Wars V and X. So, now, they are bringing the idea of ""almost everyone is travelling into our world / dimension"" thingy. 

So, the plot is still quite a mess - a problem for player if he hasn't watched any of the mechas' original stories. You're not given exposure to many of the mechas' origins, how the pilots got onto the mechas. Many of them just show up and give you conversational exposure instead of showing them. 

One such glaring example is Magic Knight Rayearth's appearance in this game. No visual exposure or narrative build-ups, like how in SRW Alpha - SRW K did, to how the girls got summoned into the world of Cephiro. No. In this game, they appear right away in their mecha, fully trained as Magic Knights, in around Stage 5 or so. And all the exposure you get is a conversation with the girls and they tell you what they had gone through. The writing is like ""we could have integrated their stories into the game, but it's too much work so let's skip all that"". 

""But their origins are already explained and written into SRW T, so surely the players already know their origins"". 

No. Definitely not. This is not just some mere ordinary entry Super Robot Wars. This is the 30th anniversary game for Super Robot Wars for God's sake. You don't just put on a one-year hiatus and cook up one SRW game and don't expect players to expect some quality in your writing - when you had previously shown competent writing in previous games. And this game is heavily marketed. One should expect many SRW newcomers coming in wanting to know what the hype is all about and the writer should at least pen down this entry into one of the best SRW in plot for them - not to please die-hard fans but to retain the new fans.

In short, don't expect Super Robot Wars Alpha to Super Robot Wars W level writing in this. Just don't. 

=============================

Now that I've finished ranting about the plot - which is quite important because SRW is casual tactical game with its plot pushed on with a visual novel format... let's move on to why i still recommend this game - but to the fans, not much to newcomers... if newcomers can look pass the lazy writing, then sure pick up this game.

== CROSS-OVER GALORE, MAN! ==

The cast is huge. Like massive huge. And with it being on Steam and Banpresto finally understanding the potential of a massive reach via this platform, they finally put in more effort over here now. 

They don't just do localization now - which is what kept many who don't know Japanese from touching SRWs, but also including Season Pass - which means there would be DLCs which could include units that you like in the future even if it's not the main feature in the game. 

And this game is Sakura Wars' debut into SRW franchise (finally! Oh, Thank God they're finally here!). So, if you want a massive happy cross-over, all-you-can-choose mecha buffet, this is it. 

== CUSTOMIZABLE BGM ==

No, they haven't included a lot of BGMs. Usually just one song for each featured franchise. Which is a good thing imo.

Why? Because the game allows you to add your own BGM into the game. 

Which means that you actually don't have to endure the simplified version of the units' Opening Songs anymore - you can just replace them with your high quality mp3 version of the songs. Imagine not just listening to the instrumental GaoGaiGar's opening song but the actual song sung by Masaki Endooh when GaoGaiGar pushed its massive hull onto the screen to kick some serious ass. Or, maybe you want to replace GaoGaiGar's theme with ""Into The Danger Zone"" from the movie ""Top Gun"" (1986)? Sure, be my guest! 

Sure, you can be angry about them saving money by not acquiring the wide array of BGMs like they did before for the units. But! With the money they saved from song copyright acquisition for the game, they can use that money to include more units into the game! And we can just replace the song with higher quality original versions of the BGMs that we can take out from our treasured mecha music record collections. I'd call that a win!

 == FREE STAGES FOR XP AND CREDIT GAIN ==

If you're the type of SRW players who felt the need to deploy the more ""weaker"", ""secondary"" units (like ,some important character in a GM unit, i.e. ""Not-Gundam"" unit) because the game's plot might force us to utilize them later and they could be too weak to handle the stage... fear not! 

Because now, there are free stages for XP and money grinding for your mecha + robot army! 

I know. I know...! Grinding is meh. But there are plenty of SRW veterans actually wished we had opportunities like in the previous games - the opportunity to train our units and then send them out to the major plot stages for some real immersive experience. 

To the most experienced fleet commanders out there, this isn't needed. But this addition, to me, is quite player-friendly - especially for the ones who would prefer to play this game more casually.

SRW is one of my favorite tactical RPGs out there, mainly because it combines giant robot anime in such a masterful way that nothing gets left behind, even some of the minor details get added or incorporated in some way, shape, or form.

If any of the gameplay looks good to you and you've never played an SRW title, this is a great one to jump into (or V/X also on steam).

Pros:

- Animations: this game has some of the best animations in the series to date. Even if most of the budget went to Gridman, the others still get some great stuff. You might be thrown off at first if you see the animations that are a bit simpler, but SRW has always been a series that makes the most of the littlest of things, including minimal movement if needed to convey something cool.

- Music: Incredible remixes of the main themes from the animes that play during combat. Even the original tracks are amazing, as always.

- Combat: Even if you're new to strategy RPGs, this game offers some incredibly easy to understand mechanics that anyone can pick up and play. Move your units and attack with them. Use Spirit during combat to give you an edge in the fight or dodge, etc.

- Story: If you've played an SRW title before, you know how crazy they can get. If you've never played one, the series will try to incorporate whatever happens in the respective chosen animes for the game and somehow ends up linking them up to make a very cohesive plot. The original elements to the story themselves are also wild.

- Dialogue: This game franchise is known to have genuinely good writing, not just in the story, but also with character interactions. You'll usually have two characters you'll never think of having something in common end up becoming closer friends after talking or having an argument. A non-spoiler interaction that stood out to me was between two pilots talking about bikes. They were having a disagreement, and one of them mentioned that the other wouldn't know what it's like to ride your troubles away only for the other pilot to mention how he has a bike, something you don't see often, if at all, that I recall, in the anime, and they bond over that.

- Length: Despite my first playthrough taking about 190 hours on expert (I mainly had animations on for a good 80% of my playthrough, it adds up, and was voice acting it on stream), it would take a person skipping animations and reading quickly a good 30+ hours to get through the main story if they do minimal side missions. Otherwise, I'd say about 40-50 if you do every side mission (including ace chats, and character interactions)  and about 60+ if you include the optional simulator missions.

Cons:

- Difficulty: Honestly, the game really is very easy. I'm not a hardcore tactics ogre, but even when playing on expert, I failed only 5 missions total. One I failed twice because I was getting used to the spirits for the unit, and two separate missions I failed twice due to RNG (literally the fail condition kept running into the enemy and getting destroyed). Excluding that I only ever lost 3 total units (one twice because I was carelessly speeding through combat). The only truly difficult mission I encountered was the first Victory Gundam mission, mainly due to the sheer number of enemies, but it was a huge thrill to actually manage my units until reinforcements arrived.

- Lore: This one is a 50/50, half pro but also half con. The game provides a lot, and I mean a lot, of background stuff for players during the very beginning. It does have a ""keyword"" system where, if you don't know what something important (in yellow text) is, you can highlight it and read a small, or large, description of the event. You don't really need to read it if you don't want to, since characters will usually give a small summary of what transpired right after it's mentioned. ""This is like what happened during X war"" ""X war? Oh, you mean the one where Y happened and resulting in Z being a-"" However, to a new player, or one that isn't an anime fan or hasn't seen the specific animes featured, they do provide enough, and a lot, of background information for you to read up on if you want to seek it out. Some people will say that this is mainly a con because it's a lot of reading, but remember: SRW has basically become an epic (in the literary sense) visual novel with tactical RPG combat segments, you're gonna be reading a lot anyway, and if you don't care about the story, or reset a mission, you can easily skip to the fight without fast-forwarding text or anything.



 *Minor spoilers for a repeating objective during a specific franchise's scenarios, skip past the ""*******""* 

*********

- The Narrative gundam scenarios are some of the worst I've ever played in an SRW title, not because of the story, which was greatly implemented, but because of the objective. In about 3 or 4 missions you need to protect the Phenex/Phoenix, but the unit itself is uncontrollable and would spawn, become surrounded by enemies and then get taken out immediately forcing a restart. Even when failing and rushing my units to the area it would spawn, and taking out any nearby enemies the phenex would still rush to the enemy lines when they would spawn and be taking out by bootleg char or be targeted regardless resulting in a loss. It wasn't infuriating, but a major pain to deal with.

*********



Overall an amazing title for anyone to enjoy. If you're new to the SRW franchise, this is an easy 9/10 title to enjoy. 

If it looks interesting in the slightest, or if you enjoy tactical RPGs with anime characters, check out the demo, and if you like it, get the game. The more we support this franchise, The more SRW titles will hopefully be translated and released in the west. Maybe we'll even get an Alpha trilogy remaster someday.

---{ Graphics }---
☐ You forget what reality is
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

Some of the best sprite-based animation today. This is the bread-and-butter of the SRW series. Some assets are reused from previous games in the series, but generally not an issue. The battle animations are so fun to watch.

---{ Gameplay }---
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

Gameplay is what you would expect from a tactical RPG. The defining gameplay differences of the SRW series is that your pilots can activate Spirit abilities and also have their own passive bonuses called Skills. Likewise, mechs also have their own unique abilities and bonuses.

New features to the series are Tactical Area Select and Auto-Battle. The Tactical Area Select system basically makes the game non-linear and opens it up for you to choose where and when to do a mission scenario. Personally, I think this is a game changer for the series and enables a lot of freedom in how to play. As for Auto-Battle, I don't find it very useful since I like to control who to feed kills to, but I can see it being useful for some busy gamers.

Mouse input support is acceptable and practical. Only thing I really don't like is how the mouse cursor doesn't hide during battle animations.

---{ Audio }---
☐ Eargasm
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

Hearing the theme music of each character's respective anime is just superb. The licensed characters are also voiced by their original voice actors. The only issue is some of the voice actors are pretty high up there in age now for the older animes and their age comes through in some of the voice lines. Not really a big problem though since it just comes with the territory because a key feature of the series is being as genuine as possible to the original shows.

---{ Audience }---
☑ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma

People who this game will appeal to are: anyone who likes big/cool/crazy-looking robots, fans of turn-based tactical games, and Gundam aficionados.

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☑ Potato
☐ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☑ Easy
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

I have read that the difficulty has shifted in the scale compared to previous games. The options are Beginner, Normal, Hard, and Expert. Apparently, the game has been made much easier and Hard is the true normal. I have been playing in Hard and can confirm that this is indeed the case and that Hard should be treated as Normal for most players.

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☑ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second live for grinding

Grinding is absolutely not necessary, although some players have devised a way to abuse Auto-Battle to farm resources.

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☑ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

Story has always been a big part of SRW. Seeing how characters from different beloved series interact with each other is always interesting.

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

There are some bugs like the Red 5 unit disappearing and some have reported the game crashing randomly when using Spirits. The devs have fixed the Red 5 issue and have shown their willingness to continue supporting the game.

---------------------------

So, coming fresh off from beating the game. It's good. It's long, but I also did most everything in the game. 

If you're familiar with other SRWs, it's fairly standard fair, especially with the newer games. For those unfamiliar with SRW, SRW 30 is a Crossover SRPG based on various mecha franchises that come together to fight their respective badguys alongside an original set of characters and plot elements.

Mechanically, the game is pretty straight forward and easy, although there is a freely adjustable difficulty setting to tune it to your tastes, with a newer, harder difficulty coming in with the Dec. DLC update. The game sets some fair rules, and both the player and the enemies have them pretty fairly applied. The game also takes a unique approach with letting you do most of the levels in any order you want, to prioritize certain units or series, allowing for the plot to work in a more free form manner, while also allowing it to add in extra options for side-content like DLC, and optional areas for secrets. As a result, the game also allows you to play it as fast or as slow as you want it to. If you wanna skip all the side missions, you can, and just get them all later. If you wanna sit back and revel in all the story, that's just more game for you, all in a single run through.

My biggest gripe with the game, but even then it isn't even all that major is that the lack of route splits, since you can more or less play through all of the stages of the game in a single run through, kinda hurts the replayability that the other games naturally tend to have as there are whole parts of the game that are otherwise missed.

Now, for actually reviewing the game, it's a good SRW and definitely one I'd recommend to people. It's got a bunch of newer, more popular mech shows that people not as involved with the games might recognize like Code Geass, Majestic Prince or Gridman, so I definitely feel like it serves as a solid entry point to the series as a whole. Outside of some minor glitches (like Red 5 disappearing for half of my game), the game ran issue free. The story was mostly interesting, the characters had well developed relationships and motivations and the animations themselves were pretty good for the most part.

I didn't have many gripes with the game, not even many minor ones. I definitely give it a 10/10 and absolutely recommend the game.",1638307419,1638307419,True,2,0,0.512882709503173828,1,True,False,False

It's hard to really explain to the uninitiated what this game means for mecha anime fans, but suffice to say it has fulfilled a long-held desire for me. I first got into the SRW series with fan-translated romhacks in the early 2000s, and I rushed out for SRW Original Generation 1 and 2 when they were released for the GameBoy Advance stateside, but alas, the bulk of the series has remained Japanese-only. A few of the more recent games have received international multi-language releases, but these still had to be imported from abroad, due to character-licensing issues. SRW 30, at last, is the first true SRW game to come to America in all its license-bloated glory. So was it worth the wait?

First, for those new to the series, Super Robot Wars is a long-running franchise of Turn-Based Strategy games set in a multiverse where giant robots and their pilots from dozens of different anime series fight with and against each other to save the world. Ever wondered how Getter Robo stacks up against Voltes V? Play the games and find out!

Most of the qualities I fell in love with from the previous games are still here, and very often improved or streamlined. The old Skill Point/Battle Mastery system has been replaced with player-selected difficulty levels, and a collection of optional battle scenarios fulfill much the same purpose as previous ""Puzzle Robo"" scenarios. Series theme songs have never sounded better, although I am sad to say there is no karaoke mode this time around.

Overall, Super Robot Wars 30 is a pleasure for both grizzled veterans of the series and complete newcomers, and I can only hope that this will not be the last US release in the series' history.",1638174433,1638176442,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is THE giant crossover, where characters from so many series interact with each other, forming relationships that you may have imagined if you ever watched those shows. Some have a history with each other already, some bonds are newly born, and most of them are pretty damn awesome.

Also, you get to Rocket Punch anybody you want.

I have no idea how this game got translated AND released on the West, but goddamn I hope this isn't the last time.",1638159230,1638159230,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First one is the Red 5 unit missing and cannot be used. However, this issue has been resolved, according to the patch notes. 2nd bug is related to the spirit bug where your game will CTD when you press the spirit command (not even accessing the spirit list yet) during the attack. This happens randomly, but persist through the whole stage when it hits. If you think you could just not use spirit command during boss battle, good luck in higher difficulty. On normal difficulty, you could choose to defend those hits, assuming they are in good health. Else, you will need to choose to sacrifice those units in order to prevent the CTD.  

On normal difficulty, you can more or less steamrolled with your units upgrades, no need to perform much optimization. As I am only playing in casual manner, this just suits me perfectly. 

Graphic wise, for the most part it is not bad. But you will be facing some FPS drop for some animations, especially enemies animation. There was a meme saying that SRW30 focusing too much in Gridman that most of their budget went to making Gridman animation perfect until they ran out of budget to make other enemies animation better. 

Gameplay wise, they introduce AOS system which adding another layer of upgrade on top of your normal mothership upgrades which could be game balance breaking imo. The way they make the story progressing to be like quest board is good feature. 

Value wise, it is just good with the base game. The DLCs are ripoff imo. If you are SRW fans, buying at full price, might not be that bad. Else, you might just want to wait for sales as it might not be your normal tactics cup of tea.

why? well, simply put, if you are a Super Robot fan, you already know most about the series.
if you are not a fan of Super Robots, you won't even end in this page to read the reviews at all xD.

no no, but talking serious now.
SRW30 seems to me as a great entry point for people new to the series. you can adjust the difficulty from start and at any intermission in the game (except if you go the last difficulty (hardcore fans of the series probably started this way lol) where you can only reduce down to hard (that is quite easy also imo)).

Basically it's a mix of many ""robot"" anime/manga series into an grid-turn-based-strategy game. there are Real Robots, Super Robots, and some that may or may not be considered robots at all. 

btw, the 30 doesn't mean it's the 30th game, it spans for more than 60 games last time i checked (and i'm not counting the reboots/remakes here!!!). it's 30 years of a great franchise that finally showed it's way into the wide world :)

I love the Super Robot Wars series. Been playing these games for over 15 years, and I love them. Sure, they cut some corners, and reuse animation cycles. I've noticed the exact same cut-aways with character-physics on some attacks that I first saw on the Nintendo DS game SRW-W 15 years ago. And some sprites and animations up-rez cleaner than some others when zooming in on attacks.

Overall though, It's a solid turn-based strategy game and a great way to be introduced to characters an series you might have missed in the mecha genre, or series that are tangentially alligned.

Pros:
-Fantastic animations
-Features many different series, meaning there's something for everyone
-If you enjoy Fire Emblem's gameplay, you'll enjoy this

Cons:

-Not incredibly challenging, if that's what you're looking for

Notes:
I came into this knowing really nothing about the game, I was just a fan of the Mazinger series and wanted to have Mazinkaiser punch some Kikaiju, but I've discovered a lot of new series that I'm now genuinely interested in, namely Mobile Suit Gundam. The gameplay is pretty relaxing, not posing too much of a challenge, but remaining engaging. The animations are very well done. Each character keeps the art style of their source material, which I find charming.

Now, playing SRW30, I can definitely say this game is amazing. New mechanics like free missions and urgent missions, as well as missions that allow you to grind until you're ready. I must say that this is by far the best SRW game ever made (that I have played). SRW V remains my favourite non-OG SRW game due to me liking many of the series in it as well as preferring the Mazinger Theme in V more than 30 (also because Mazinger Zero), but the full price pre purchase is definitely worth it for me. Those looking to start with SRW series should definitely give 30 a try, as its quite easy to learn, and the game allows you to do a lot of preparation until you're ready to face your next foe.

898750,103571506,76561198027547845,0,59,911,0,911,1637792935,"Well, here it is. After over thirty years, the Super Robot Wars franchise has officially traveled overseas. And I say officially because this is the very first non-spinoff title in the franchise that has come out for an overseas retailer. While the first two Original Generation games came out years ago for the Game Boy Advance, I count those as semi-spinoffs. The real big deal is this.

What is it about? The basic premise is that this is a turn-based strategy game in which giant robots from various old-school and recent anime series duke it out together. The pilots of the robots have various abilities to give themselves an edge whenever they need it, reminiscent to how, in the series they come from, those same pilots seem to gather skill, strength and will to fight from apparently thin air. There's also a bunch of original characters who act as surrogates and avatars for the player.

I love this franchise. And I want to love this game. Believe me, I do. But while the game is not bad, there are some glaring bugbears in it. Without those bugbears, the game would have been a lot better.

For starters, the attack animations tend to be uninspired. They're not as bad as they were in the immediately previous installments of this series, Super Robot Wars V, X and T, and in fact there is a clear intent to improve over those, but they could have done a lot more with them. Even in the handheld installments, especially the ones for DS, the animations were impressive, dynamic, full of spirit, and often had special animations for when you managed to destroy an enemy. In this installment, there are a few of those, but they are not very abundant. Oh, well, at least there are no recycled animations from V, X or T for the units from those that show up here, for the most part.

Second, the sound department is okay... ish. Again, better than in V, X or T, the immediate predecesors, but still a long shot from installments like the Z series. While the original character, your avatar, has a vocal theme song whereas in the past they had an instrumental one like everyone else, everyone else seems to have gotten their theme musics adapted rather dully for this game. There are some exceptions that manage to sound amazing, like Gridman's Yume no Hero, but those are rare. Overall, they are good, but I have seen better in the franchise.

The third and final bugbear, the biggest one in my opinion, is the fact that the UI is unintuitive and the controls are clunky, overall. Thankfully, there's no need for pinpoint precision with games like these, so it can be overlooked up to a point, but the fact that I cannot quickly access what every pilot skill means without juggling with at least 4 info screens, and needing to press a specific key in the keyboard for each of them before I can access what I want to see, is worrying to say the least. In past installments it was not this difficult to look at what skill did what. Moreover, the fact that the mouse is not entirely capable of handling everything, needing keyboard presses here and there, is a bit jarring, because I tend to forget what key did I have to press to get to a particular screen. Thankfully, for the most vital things, it's not that bad, you will only truly feel pain when you try to look up what pilot skills or unit abilities do, or some other specific thing like that.

With those bugbears aside, tho, and taking into account that the game has room for improvement, I would say that it is still money well spent. I'm finding the story, something that's usually forgettable, to be a blast, and the gameplay is great. Being able to choose what scenario I want to tackle and in what order makes it so that I can basically choose what units I want in my lineup at what point of the game, and the difficulty selection is a nice touch. I am playing in Expert mode, and despite me being a Super Robot Wars veteran, the game is taking advantage of every single tactical mistake I make, no matter how small, to kick my chest without mercy, shattering my ribs into hundreds of tiny shards that get embedded in my lungs and make me cough up blood. And I wouldn't have it any other way. Past installments were super easy to clear from start to finish when you gained momentum, barring some big exceptions. For the first time in years, this franchise is challenging me, forcing me to use my braincells, and that makes the flaws tolerable for me.

I would say, if you are a fan of strategy games with RPG elements, give it a try. Despite its flaws, it's a good game, and while it might take you a while to get into it, who knows? It might hook you up enough to look into other installments of the saga and see just how wonderful Super Robot Wars is.",1637795286,1637836786,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,3,True,False,False

Probably a bit too expensive to recommend if you're not invested in any of the properties involved already, but for what it's worth it's a quite good strategy JRPG and the sprite work is excellent.

The story is the kind of gibberish that you tend to get in super robot wars where they just sort of slam the plots of all these series together with little regard for actual logical sense or tone. It's moderately embarrassing fan fiction level stuff but nobody gives a shit, that's not why we're here. We're here to see goofball 70s fashion statements next to edgy, tragic child soldiers and boy howdy does it deliver on that front. You can murder edgy gas mask robots with yo-yos and the power of friendship. 10/10,

It's fan service the game and that's exactly what it's supposed to be.

Further thoughts after another 60 hours: The only bug I've had that's affected gameplay is the DLC inexplicably eating one of the dorks from Majestic Prince, but that's okay because nobody cares about them. Also the game's difficulty completely drops off a cliff after about three hours but that's kind of par for the course I suppose.

There's some secrets in the game if you do things in a particular order or focus on certain heroes.   Also if you play with your favorites a lot and ignore other heroes, it's not too hard to rank them up later if you need to.

Animations are nice, fluid and impactful for most of the units. Some of them are kind of... stiff, but nothing to complain.

Not like difficulty, though. Game it's so easy that it can play itself. Literally. There is mode that allows the game to play by itself. Some scaling options would be nice to prevent one-hitting the bosses.

Game music is composed by renditions to anime openings or soundtracks from their respective series. Some sound good, other sounds meh, and one sounds like it's made by someone farting on a bathroom. There's a DLC that adds more tracks, but you can add your custom ones too.

For the 30th year anniversary of the series something amazing happened - we got a global Steam release. This is something I never thought I'd see happen and is absolutely huge for the series.

Putting in over 100 hours I finished the game and the DLC1 Pack. The game is a blast with a really great crossover cast and lots of really good moments. The animations are the best they've been in the HD era (outside of 2nd OG and Moon Dwellers).

Pros:
+The new Tactical Area Selection system is definitely a breath of fresh air. It gives some much needed non-linearity to the game and even adds a little replay value. I hope future games continue to build and improve on this system.
+The story is competently written, and almost every entry plays a role, even post-series ones. The original characters are well-written and likable. And even the series I'm not familiar with are written in such a way that it's easy to understand them just by playing the game.
+The support system is MUCH more useful compared to the one in T (which I barely even used), with constantly active passive effects, more ways to fill up support SP, upgrades to the SSP system, as well as more useful, evolving support abilities.
+A lot more unit-unique skills, which helps make units feel more distinct from one another.
+Refreshingly enough, the DLC units aren't just dumped onto your ship like the pre-order packs. They actually serve as part of an overarching story. Also the Sakura Wars DLC in particular is extremely fun, complete with dialogue choices just like in the source material.

Cons:
-The animation, in general, feels pretty meh. The new unit intro system is really hit or miss, with more misses than hits. Some of them look good, but most just disrupt the flow of battle animation by adding a black screen in between attack and counter attack. Some of the attack animations actually look worse than before, like how Nu Gundam's All Range Attack lost its dynamic kill. The only really stunning animation I can think of are Gridman and Final GGG.
-If you buy the deluxe edition, the game dumps a ton of resources on you before you even start. You do get the option to not open them, but it would have been nice to have an option to just turn them off.
-Hitting the level cap is too easy. By late mid game, pretty much all of my main units are Lv 99 with 100+ kills, at which point scoring kills with them just doesn't do anything to make them better. This makes it so you have less of a motivation to keep improving a character.
-The DLC characters, the protagonist you didn't pick, and secret characters, all feel like non-entities. Once they join, pretty much all they do is occasionally speak up to let you know ""Yeah, we're still here."" This coupled with how late most of the secret characters join (by which point your main units are pretty much all OP god machines), makes them feel less like characters you can use and more like Pokemons to be collected.
-To make the above worse, the deploy number is too limited. I barely have enough room to deploy all my heavy hitters, much less any side characters and secret characters. And it only gets worse with DLCs.
-As with the last few games, the terrain system is ridiculously underused. I don't think I've ever seen even one HP or EN restoring terrain in the entire game. It makes me wonder why they even show up in the terrain stats.
-Series like Zeta, Getter, and Code Geass really could have used more love. Getter in particular reuses all the animations from T and barely even has a role in the story despite being one of the big three from the original SRW. Even the Invaders just disappear somewhere in the story without even a boss fight. Also, GaoGaiGar vs Betterman's adaptation cut out a LOT of stuff, presumably due to J-Decker being the focus in this game.
-Finally, technical issues. During my playthrough I suffered multiple CTDs that caused me to lose hours of progress (especially devastating in a game that doesn't even have auto save). And then there's the bug that inexplicably causes Red Five to disappear from the game after installing DLC 1, which the developers have still yet to fix as of the time of writing. For a game commemorating the 30th anniversary of SRW, this level of failure is simply unacceptable.

Overall, I would give the game an 8 out of 10. It's certainly a great improvement over T, though it could have been a lot better.",1637214965,1637215170,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If this is your first SRW game, than this is a very good entry point. This is a good game and it's quite long to complete. It's a bit on the easy side on Normal mode. A veteran can beat the entire game on Hard mode with only 50% upgrades. Money shouldn't be an issue, and it's easy to reach lv 99 naturally without grinding. You will spend a lot of hours playing this.

If this is not your first SRW game, there are a few things to consider.

1. If you are fan of the newer entries or ones that you haven't seen in a long time such as Knight and Magic, L Gaim, Gridman, Gundam Narrative, Combattler, Majestic Prince, Brave Police) you will enjoy their treatment

2. If you are expecting some new tricks from the returning series, than you will probably be disappointed. The returning series recycle a lot from SRW VXT

3. After clearing this once I can tell that this is clearly the setup game to a planned sequel or expansion. They  seem to be holding back some of the surprises you might have seen in earlier games.

4. As said I haven't experienced any of the paid DLCs, but they seem to be newer entries that didn't return or debut in SRW VXT, so expect newer animation or updated sprites.",1637141670,1637187883,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Quality of attacks animation of the series has been in decline ever since after Z3. Z3 > V X > T & 30. (some series still has awesome attack animation like Yamato, Cross Ange, Expelled from Paradise etc)

So with that in mind, don't bother buying this game if you solely want that. 

Also it's not like the animations are completely trash or anything like that. On its own the animations are still great. It just cannot be compared to games like OG or SRW Z2 and Z3. 

With that out of the way, this game is a very welcoming change to the series imo. The UI gets a big overhaul and we have new fresh mechanics such as facility upgrade that benefits in different way. Customize the way you want to specialize on in different way, it's pretty new to the series. Also adds more replayability.

No more linear story path as well, you can choose the mission branch to do first, which mean you can choose what unit to get first. That is very good for people who want to prioritize on unit they really like.

Most importantly for me, no more ""gameover loop"" just to farm for credits and PP anymore. There are free missions dedicated to farming purpose which is very welcoming.

Difficulty is pretty easy on normal mode but you can adjust the difficulty to make the game more challenging, so it's not an issue in that regard.

So animations might be slightly disappointing but the gameplay surely makes up for it for me.

-Fantastic bgm as always, always banger.
-Satisfy animation for some unit
-More pre-action animation for more cooler (used to be standing still when speaking)
-New way to pick mission instead of follow episode wise
-Release on PC (Nice)

Cons:
-A lot of animation are very stiff, the quality has been drop a lot.
-There is few side mission you will feel disconnect if you keep rushing instead playing main mission (appearance of J and Runee)
-One move boss, lack of animation for boss. (But I guess kinda make sense if it's just appear for one chapter)

I believe it started with the VXT Trilogy, the focus on animation is even more emphasized and it come at the cost of gameplay. The already minimum tactical elements is downgraded to become even less than before. 30 continues this dumbing down trend.

Pros:
- Cool Animations
- Cool Soundtrack

Cons
- There is only real robot upgrade and no super robot upgrade
- Enemies has only like 1-2 attacks. even main villains like Katejina or Chronicle only has 2 attacks. This making the game predictable.
- Some units are missing their separate/transform function making some strategy no longer possible which result in monotonic gameplay.
- Boobs animation are downgraded, they're not as smooth as in the PS2/PS3 era. Some character even don't have any (completely missing the boing in an unnatural way or the animation is designed to prevent any boing to occur, some other has it but very minimal). 
- In DLC1 trailer, Kusuha's cut in animation is missing. Is it still in work in progress or they remove it completely?. Confirmed: all boing has been removed
- There is one line about american's gender propaganda inserted into the game https://www.sankakucomplex.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SuperRobotWars30-Altered-English-Dialogue.jpg

Yes, my bias is showing since I have always loved SRW even before where I had to play one while trying to memorize the kanji translations for the Menu and the Spirit Commands...
This particular iteration of SRW is a bit easier to play than some of the older versions, even though it still has the tactical nuances from combo attacks and special abilities, just not as complicated mechanics-wise as their previous implementations (most probably to welcome new players to the franchise)...

Obviously, the main point of playing SRW is to command the various Super Robots and Real Robots from the various shows in one (relatively) coherent storyline... 
I've watched most of the shows these robots come from so I really enjoy playing with them. Once you've collected more than 12 of them, you basically need to rotate between them on missions. You could min-max their setup and play with a selected few units upgraded to the nines, but I prefer spreading out my playing time across the different shows and try to play thematically appropriate robots depending on the mission (just not Magical Girl Rayearth... Not my cup of tea... LOL)

Excited for the upcoming DLC featuring Sakura Wars, which is its own tactics game franchise. AFAIK, this is their first appearance in SRW... 
Also making a return appearance is Voltes V!!! I believe this is their first appearance in an English-language SRW... The last SRW I played which included them was Shin Super Robot Wars (Super Robot Wars Neo) on the PS1 over 20 years ago (using a translation guide...).

So for SRW-lovers, this review is moot since you probably are already busy playing it since launch... For newcomers to the franchise, this is a relatively newbie-friendly title for you to start enjoying this franchise with...",1636980942,1636981228,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Excellent English translation.
- Attack Animations are visually breathtaking.
- Killer Soundtrack containing classic and original tracks.
- Stellar sound design.
- Satisfying gameplay and character progression.
- Faithful and well-done vocal performances.
- Great and varied cast of characters and mechs that each mostly feel unique and fleshed out.

Cons:
- WAY too easy for anyone remotely experienced in strategy games. Exploits in abilities/spirits/equipment are far too common. Recommend starting on Hard Mode and then switching to the highest difficulty after a while, but even then the fear of a mech falling in combat let alone failing a mission will be a rare occurrence.
- While the writing and world-building are competently handled considering how many shows and characters it has to account for, LOTS of lore from previous games and mecha series are referenced and discussed, which will make casual players like myself feel a bit lost on occasion. There are reference guides for each character and major events, but it's still a lot to ask for newcomers. Some visual recaps of important scenes from previous games and the animes would have been appreciated more than walls of text.
- Clashing artstyles of character CGs make it feel more like a low budget fanfic (albeit understandable and unavoidable; a nitpick really).
- The budget was clearly focused on the attack animations because everything else in this game, while not bad by any means, feels very cheap in its presentation. This is mostly an issue of the visual novel sections being minimalistic in its visuals with zero voice acting whatsoever, as well as the combat map overworld being very simplistic, low resolution in its textures, and completely barren in animations for enemies and allies.

Despite having a lot to say about the Cons, I do feel that they're pretty easy to overlook/ignore considering everything else Super Robot Wars 30 knocks out of the park.

- Game is very long if you do all the side missions (but worth it imo).

- The mission selection system and the Area map makes the game feel more sandbox and open-world (which is a good thing imo), compared to the classic linear (with branches) structure.

I even dipped back into some of the older SNES and Saturn Era games. I didn't REALLY get into the series until the modern era with OG on PS4, and Then V got me really hooked.

This is my first experience on PC/Steam and It's been great. I had a weird bug that was fixed just by turning off AA. But, other than that I have had a lot of fun. 

As a big fan of the Knights and Magic Anime, I was glad to see I could get Ernesti (and friends) early on if I wanted to. And I recommend doing it just so you can see him geeking out over other robots through the game.

Overall the roster is solid and they really feel like they tied a lot of their mish-mashed narratives and stories together with dialog often referring to older games and story elements of the series. But, it also isn't done too jarring to take away from first time players of the series.

With that said this is a PERFECT game for new players to get into. The normal setting i feel is too easy so far, but I think it would help with new players coming in and just testing the waters with both learning systems and upgrades right along side of story and narrative.

I do wish, however, there were even more options as far as mixing and matching upgrades and pilots. Some menus options are hidden behind other menu options, but it's not super in depth either. That is a double edged sword.

I hope moving forward they bring in more tactical gameplay with positioning, flying, terrain, etc. A lot of that is missing in this title. But, it is still fun.

I'd give it a solid 8/10.

I like the world of X more, the overall gameplay of T more, but the cast of 30 is so huge with so much more still yet to come.

Bottom line, newbies and long time fans can both enjoy this game. I'd even recommend it to fans of non-mecha series and see if any of the characters maybe get them to try out the anime they come from.",1636778991,1636778991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been a fan of SRW since I was a teenager back when the original OG game released on the GBA in English and I've been playing the games (old and new) ever since- so I went in with high hopes for SRW 30.

I was extremely pleased with the new Tactical Area system. You're allowed to progress through the world to your own pace and liking. While non-linear elements have been in past games, SRW 30 dials the scope WAY up. SRW always had replay value in terms of story, but being able to play the game you like with the story unfolding in the order you choose really goes to show how much love and passion Terada and his team put in. 

Just as important is the Dreistrager ship which is your base of operations. More than just a battleship like past iterations, now you can customize certain parts of the ship to give various bonuses such as reducing repair costs or improving pilots skills. Quite an improvement from the TacP bonuses in V, X and T. 

That said, the world map function could have been implemented better. Since all of the core story missions are taken from the Mission selection menu, you'll find yourself only accessing the world map to tackle the occasion Relic mission, send out units on patrol or rarely encounter a being that gifts you funds. 

The story is just about average for SRW, though the protagonists (I chose Edge on my first play) and captain Mitsuba are genuinely interesting and the mystery of your character is intriguing to follow. The series list for SRW 30 is unique if a bit odd, but regardless all made to feel like they belong in the game world in some way.

The highlight for me would be the game adapting the GaoGaiGar vs Betterman novel, and being a huge fan of the Brave series, having J-Decker front and center made me very happy and I always fielded the involved units. 

I do have some gripes with the units included, though. While the series list has 22 participating series, 6 of which are unit only and aside from Mazinkaiser most of them have almost no involvement. Z-MSV simply is are option parts for the Gundam Mk. II, and even Amuro's MP Nu Gundam is traded out for the genuine Nu Gundam. Now the game's Newtypes all having suits of their own means you will always use the inferior INCOM for the MP Nu. Even worse, Hi-Nu Gundam will be DLC so Nu Gundam will eventually become a pointless unit to use with the rest of the generic UC pilots.

The rest of the series have amazing representation, however. While some of the L-Gaim story has been cut due to L-Gaim happening in another star system entirely, the best characters and units are all available. Knight's and Magic has fewer units than I thought though Ernie having comments on just about every other robot more than makes up for it! 

Overall, Super Robot Wars 30 was very enjoyable from beginning to end. While I did feel there could be some improvements, namely in the robot inclusions, the game being as massive as it is means you will play this one for a long while. It took me 120~ hours to complete a single ending over the course of two weeks, so playing to see every ending with both characters on both routes will give you a very enjoyable experience every time, even without the DLC. 

Bandai Namco, please don't sleep on this game. You have a lot you can expand upon with future DLC. Instead of making the same mistake you did going from V to X, support this game. Give the Dreikreuz further adventures, with more robot series. There's so much potential to be had! There's still so much room left to explore if the ending I've seen is any indication of what could be possible.

If you are long term srw fan and at least play since SRW4 then this is the game for you.
Many events, dialog, animation kind of resemble the old SRW.
For overall animation is not good as recently SRW (V,X,T)

[b]Story[/b]
Main story is ok with some very good cross over moment.

[b]Animation[/b]
I don't mean every units are bad.
Some units have pretty good animation
Some are super bad, and when your favorite unit is bad, it pretty suck.
The animation disparity is too much.

Super good animation
- Gridman
- Red5

Super bad animation
- Main character's  2nd unit
- Gundam Phenex
- Ikaruga's strongest attack (first half)

Super Robot Wars 30 is the latest in a long line of fantastic strategy games featuring mecha & heroes from anime history as far back as Mazinger and Getter to new generation titles like SSSS Gridman and Code Geass. The best part? All these characters meet in-universe in a massive multiverse stretching across 50+ hours of story that integrates huge parts of their original anime plot into the game. 

You'd think this would make the plot bad, but it is written extremely well. The game has an original story line that ties together crossroads from all the mechas as they solve the catastrophes in each of their own universes. The game almost makes it feel like all these stories were supposed to be in the same universe to begin with! Even if there are titles you don't know or like, Super Robot Wars has always found a way to make them cool. In a way, it is a great way to discover mecha you never knew about before. The localization is fantastic, and you can really tell that passionate mecha fans who knew and understood the characters helped translate this game. There are quite a few typos that were missed during quality checks, but those are in the minority. The music is superb, featuring a variety of great original tracks and slightly reprised themes of classic mechas that are loyal while still fitting the game. Attacks are beautifully animated with art styles and even frame-rate adjustments to stay loyal to the source material. The strategy layer is quite basic with percentage based chances dictating the flow of combat and systems that help you shift those percentages in your favor. The game can be brutal sometimes at higher difficulties, but is quite easy even for strategy newcomers.

I have play SRW since 1997, love this series, love robot anime.
SRW30 has solid gameplay, beautiful graphics, and the longest playtime of all of SRW game I have ever played.
I spent 86 hours beating it for the first time. But you need to beat it twice to get all achievements, so another 44 hours for you.
2 things i don’t like about SRW 30:
(1)the protagonist's mecha is lame, and no matter what protagonist you choose, you have the same mecha.
(2)There is no different route to choose, thus the second playthru is almost exactly the same as the first time.

If you like mecha anime, you will love this game. But as a SRW veteran player, I expect more from the 30th game.

我的评分:7/10
这是我玩机战20多年来，游戏时间最长的一部作品，86小时一周目，44小时二周目。内容很丰富。
但是有两点我不喜欢
(1)主角机只有一个，男女主角没有任何区别。主角机也没有中期的升级，只是增加了武器。
(2)完全取消多路线设计，所以二周目的剧情基本上跟一周目一样，玩二周目完全是为了全成就。
如果喜欢机器人动画，也会喜欢玩这个作品。但是作为具有纪念性的30年作品，我觉得应该可以做得更好一些。

-A huge selection of characters from various titles, with more coming on the way (I made sure to pick up the version with DLC so that way I can get the characters from Sakura Wars and Ultraman when they come out).

-A system in which most of the battles can be handled in any order (with the player opting to take some time off from the main missions to play side quests and look for relics).

-The ability to add your own songs, thus giving characters their own themes for specific attacks (I just had to incorporate the theme to Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad, the 1990's American version of Gridman, into one his attacks).

The strategy-level portion of it is largely secondary to the fanservice aspects of it, but they are serviceable but fun SRPGs. SRW30 is the first non-original-characters-only version to make it to the US. And that's cool as hell. It is very fun. You should check it out if you enjoy mecha action and/or SRPGs.

OK, let's talk about what's new and different about this one. SRW veterans are probably aware that these games aren't especially hard, even on their maximum settings, unless you deliberately play to that fact. Which, yeah, that's true here. Like the last couple games, SR points are gone, so there's no bonus challenges either.

But: this is actually kind of the biggest departure of this series to date in terms of format, in that they've largely gotten rid of the ""route"" system of previous games in favor of a free-form adaptable series of missions. Dialog in these missions is actually pretty dynamic and changes based on who you've recruited and the sequence of events, though the story doesn't actually change or anything. It's a fun addition that gives greater intrigue to your approach to executing missions. 

There's some half-baked aspects to this new system, in that it never bottlenecks your cast down in the way the old route system did to force you to use underserved parts of the cast sometimes (e.g., no ""well I guess I'm fielding the Methuss *SIGH*"" moments), which further lessens the difficulty. Also, the whole ""world map"" system seems like it needs some more meaning, as they don't actually have any ""cost"" to you moving around. There's not a lot of point to browsing the map beyond the occasional class of mission that doesn't show up in your mission list.

Altogether: I'm really enjoying my time with SRW30. It's both relaxing and engaging.",1635404495,1636248749,True,2,1,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Pros:
-Preserves the charm and appeal that is known to the SRW genre
-An SRW game you can buy without needing to region swap (woohoo!)
-""final attacks"" are just as gratuitous and melodramatic as ever
-Noticeable graphical improvements over the previous game
-Implementation of auto-battling for AFK farming
-Addition of AOS system provides a new layer of customization and performance enhancements for the game

Cons
-UI is atrocious, play with a controller, otherwise get ready to deal with some pretty ugly looking button prompts. Also the game cannot be played with only the mouse (unlike similar games), there are some parts of the menu that look like you can click on when you actually can't
-Following from above, the controls are not very intuitive if you are on mouse and keyboard
-Tutorials are terrible, not so bad if you are an SRW veteran but the game can be pretty inaccessible for people new to the series
-Some enemies and backgrounds are of noticeably lower quality compared to the main units

Personal Gripes:
-lot more super robot, lot less real robot compared to other games
-upgrade path of the main unit is incredibly dull compared to the Vangnex or the Tyranado, no difference in upgrade path based on your starting character
-apparently you can't freely name your character, my last name is Wang which is the proper spelling in pinyin, however when I went to enter that into the character creation menu it said that name was forbidden, game is racist I guess...

Gameplay is pretty standard SRW flare that features your units engaging with scores of enemy waves per stage but what units you decide to use and how you decide to proceed with the stage objective is up to your own decisions. It may not be a very difficult game, but that won't stop you from hopefully having fun trying out new combinations of units and pilots every stage.

basically you get 22 series and a load of original units and characters mixed into one story with key plot points from most shows in the game unless it says otherwise. Also the first ever English dubbed version that gets a release outside of Asia aside from the first 2 original generation games on gba when that was still a thing.
you can level up both your units, ships and characters.
should you find one or perhaps a few shows in the game you dislike, you can totally and without consequence for the most part put them on the bench and never really use them, and when there's levels with story elements for them even then you can still send them back into your ships.

in the end if your a mecha fan worth their salt you should give this a try, if your just into tactical turn based strategy with a good story you should give this a try, if your new to all the aforementioned you should give this a try. just give it a try period

To sum up my experience of the Space route I'm happy with the game and its now one of my top favorite games/SRW games. It makes me excited to see what coming up in the DLC. To break down some thoughts and only minor spoilers of mechs to obtain. These are my thoughts:

Majestic Prince Mechs: They are all top notch mechs. They made the early bits of the game great with their dialogue and the show itself is really good. If the music doesn't get you pumped go watch the opening to the anime and hear it with the lyrics. Out of the 5 the best is Red 5/Izuru as he gets not only intuition early (Intuition is the basis of all good mechs IMO) and accel. However by no means are the other ones not as good. The Rabbits serve a good purpose: to clear ads on the map, and chip down bosses or get the kill. Utilizing all of them in the early game will help out their longevity.

Moving on

Uso and the Victory: Its a capable unit. Uso is a good pilot and has decent skills along with Haru. He becomes very important whenever you are dealing with any of the Zanscare units and the characters (specifically Katejina and Cronicle). The victory will serve you well and gets alot better later on >.>

Getter Dragon and Ryoma and the gang: Hands down one of the best units to use for all the game. He can solo maps by himself and reliable 1-2 shot any boss with proper set up (are you using your ExC abilities?) Using him as a mainstay in any sortie will usually get a win. GETTER BEAAAAMU!

And hands down my favorite unit and character throughout the game

Ernesti and the Ikaruga: They are IMO an S+ unit that will be useful at any point in the game. The Ikaruga combines speed, unrivaled Mobility and a pilot with all the best abilities (maybe could do with 1-2 more but there's ways around that). Knights and Magic is also a good series and 100% recommend it as well as using Ernesti. You can use Kid and the Tzendolg as well, but I feel their use falls off a bit.

Notable mentions are the Rayearth trio. DO NOT SLEEP ON THEM!!! They are some of the best units and if you are a long running SRW player more so the OG versions, they shine very well fielded together like Princes Shine and Latoonee. Combine attacks are always very welcome and theirs are no slouch in the damage department (plus they all get Love as their last action). Umi is IMO the best one out of them as she gets Accel and Intuition early. 

Pluses of the Game:
+The soundtrack is AMAZING! You wont be disappointed by buying the sound track.
+Some of my favorite mechs and ones i've never seen before.
+The story is a Space drama and as a life long fan of Yamato this is very much welcomed. 
+Uhh GUNDAMS!
+Many more things to see >.>


Some downsides to the game (IMO not very strong points to go against the game):
-The game is easy on Normal and Easy big recommend the 2 harder difficulties. 
-They don't explain the AoS system very well or how useful the Dreistrager can be. READ ALL OF THE ABILITIES OF THE AOS UPDATE AS THEY CAN MAKE UPGRADING UNITS EASIER; also, I recommend if you don't know what to get early I would say get the MxC upgrades and Credit/EXP upgrades as these make early game a good way to generate alot of MxC. Also if you have them use the double credit spirit as often as you can.
-Some errors in text, but this is largely minor since i'm happy we got a game at all.

Pros
-Pilot points earned just goes into a pool where everyone can use to upgrade/learn new skills
-Repeatable missions for grinding and challenge missions
-They got Code Geass, need I say more?

Cons
-The game is WAY too easy, switch to expert as soon as you know what you're doing, otherwise its really boring because this game gives you way too many tools to succeed, and the fact that you can use spirits on the enemy turn blows my mind (Note:In the older SRW games, you had to make up your mind about using these abilities on your own turn)
-The music track for each mech series is pretty awful, even though I m aware you can find and put in your own music, but still, I shouldn't have to do that.
-A lot of the mechs don't have their full attack set or they are using a older mech, so they make you fulfill conditions like (Kill XX amount of enemies to unlock a special stage to unlock a move or their newer mech), This I think is an attempt to pat out the game time but makes it so grindy.
-The combat and attack animations are kinda meh, if you've played moon dwellers on the PS4 or the other OG series, you're really going to notice it.

In conclusion, I think if you've never played a SRW game before. You are in for a treat, but if you're a veteran of the series this game's alright.

So I'm super happy that it's finally available to the west on PC, translated and everything. No hoops to jump thru with ordering from overseas and pretending your PS4 is in Singapore, etc... 

If you are coming into this knowing what SRW is and don't have some expectations of a specific character/series being included, you will be happy.

If you are expecting challenging turn based strategy with anime robots and characters, you will be disappointed. Civilization/Romance of the Three Kingdoms this aint. If you want a fun romp with anime series interactions would never every happen with a tactical game aspect, then you'll be set.

The game has a mode where it plays itself for you. 

I think it's the easiest SRW game I've ever played, and that's OK. I'm still having a blast.

I only have one complaint, and it's a minor one. Being in the west, I've never had launch day access to these games before. I've always played them after all the DLC was released. Now I find myself wondering if I should should wait this all the DLC is released to continue playing... or just do another play through after the dlc is released assuming there will be a new game+ mode.

However this isn't really a ""game"" so to speak, more like a AAA-quality fan fiction visual novel, without the cringe of fanfics because the writers know their source material inside out and remain faithful to the sources. They say Avengers : Endgame or Super Smash Brothers is the most ambitious crossover event? This series holds the actual Guinness World Record for that. There are cross-series interactions between characters from during text-based story segments, to in-combat voice lines referencing each other (voiced by their original voice actors). Oh, and top that off with anime-esque battle animations, and you've got the best crossover feature in the world (no exaggeration).

I started this series with Z2 and have played mostly all but some titles from Alpha 3 and up through emulation. The fact that such a niche series of games can last 30 years is a testament to its quality.

[h2] Loyalty to what SRW has been offering all these years [/h2]

I started playing SRW since GameBoy era, and when I was young and naive, all those mecha dream inspired me and kept me playing for weeks if not months. After this many years, I grew up together with this franchise.
You do see this old formula in this game as well, grid based maps, attack animations. I would appreciate the loyalty to the SRW I loved.

[h2] Is this game any good? [/h2]
I would say, this game, if came out a decade ago, around 2008, 2009, this game would be a huge love letter to PC gamers and SRW fans - but seeing it in a context of 2021, this is quite a lackluster.

Pros
- Mecha Hype
- Can't complain about all the Waifus
- The best graphics so far in the series
- Main robots has HD graphics

Cons
- Poor port to PC: certain operations feels awkward when using Keyboard/Mouse
- Stew mix like plot is somewhat not interesting enough
- While main robots have HD graphics, it's not fun to see other enlarged pixelated robots everywhere in the game - this made me feel this is a past asset dump
- Launch seems rough with bugs/crashes

[h2] Verdict [/h2]

This game is like a childhood dream came true for experienced PC gamers. Definitely can be a better experience on PC. With some history in mind, it's somewhat disappointing for this franchise - This game is still limited to its original fanbase, other than trying to make broader influences.

Seeing all the evolution of gamings all these years, strategy games had its days - Back in the day, I played many good strategy games. Some honorable mentions - Thurder forces (致命武力), Wind Fantasy (风色幻想), these are all great games, I would say even better than SRW. As a fan of SRW, I always wish that SRW can catch up on technologies and stop paying stupid amount of money for copy rights, while left no budgets for bringing new life to this franchise.

That having been said, you should know that this is a Strategy RPG with *lots* of tiny variables and micro-management.

The storyline is fairly standard as far as JRPGs or Anime shows go, and if you're in the US, a lot of the various Mechs from other franchises are going to be something you look up on Google every time they're introduced. 

Those caveats aside, its a well done SRPG and the micro-management is a blast. The new auto-battle mode is going to be convenient if you want to plow through the branching storyline for each path. The animations are top notch and give a great feeling to your battles.

While that was a test-bench game that failed to live up to its potential, SRW 30 has the right mix of stage choice, conversations and unlockables that make it a decent game. It is not without its flaws however. This review is also writing 40 hours in, and I have not completed the game yet, but I feel knowledgeable enough of it to give this review.

The GOOD:
- SSSS GRIDMAN: Nuff Said
- All the new animations are great: There is not one new series with bad animation, and even new additions to returning series get  these updates
- Large Units feel large: This was something BP has experimented on since SRW Z3 (most notably the EVA-13) where they make the sprite large to better reflect the size and scale of the unit. This is done very well in this game, looking at units like Combattler V for example
- Every mainline series gets love*: Whether its a few stages, additional dialogue, or in-stage banter, every series feels represented here (*The only exception is Knights&Magic which skips the majority of the plot and sticks it with Rayearth. You wont get a K&M stage, without it also being a Rayearth Stage)
- Game Length: From Main Plot, to side missions, to challenge missions, to repeatable grind missions, to relic missions, this game has alot of stages, and taking time to do all these will rack up hours easily. There is alot to do, and alot of dialogue to read through, which is great for those who want alot of plot. You can easily put in 30+ hrs and not be finished with this game.
- The Battleship Design: The new OG Battleship follows the VXT Formula of having an additional system that directly impacts the game, but its really fleshed out by this game. With some of the upgrades, you can change how you play the game (such as adding EX-C points, increasing weapon damage, adding more upgrade slots) and even how the battleship itself plays (Adding Barriers, Counter-Weapons, Regen, etc.) It grows dynamically throughout the game, and really feels like BP has nailed the system.
- Difficulty Slider: By having Expert unlocked at the start, it gives both new players and veterans the choice to tweak the game difficulty to their preferences, something with VXT was notorious for not providing by being too easy.
- Auto-System: While a controversial one, this is best used for grinding missions.

The BAD:
- OG Unit: Huckbein 30 is a copout. Its not interesting, its first upgrade is laughable with just 1 new attack and some animation change (only 1 upgrade so far where I've reached, and the XXX serves no purpose, being removed with the upgrade), and it feels like nostalgia-bait instead of being unique. It is easily outclassed by the OG Ship and the OG enemy designs. For this to be the poster unit is such a glaring mis-step in an otherwise decent game. There hasn't been an OG unit so disappointing since SRW L on the DS and SRW OE on the PSP.
- Older Series show their age: Even series that are 1 game old show their age in animation quality in comparison to the new units. The notable exception to this is GunXSword, which still looks great even being ported. (Compare GaoGaiGar against all the new GGG units added, and you can easily see how lackluster its animation is.)
- Auto-System: Using this outside of grinding maps is a battle against stupidity. The AI most often will not attack after moving, will ignore Hit&Away, will use far stronger attacks than required to kill an enemy and drain your EN, and more..... Do not use this unless you want to grind.
- Lack of PC Customization: There is very little you can customize outside of MSAA and subtitles. For a PC release this is a crime.
- Game Padding: Depending on the player, this can be good or bad, as the game shows its padding with the Relic and Grinding Stages, which can easily add up in hours.
- DLC Plan: If G Gen Crossrays is anything to follow, expect only units without plot, which especially hurts in a game like SRW where plot is key to enjoying the series. Having Sakura Wars and Ultraman soon to be added as units only, feels really disappointing. (I pray I am wrong with this point, and will update when DLC is released).
- PC Port Problems:
 1) Keyboard and Mouse Control is clunky and not designed well. I would recommend plugging in a PS4 or Xbox Controller and playing with those instead.
 2) Custom BGM is not well explained. To use your own music, you go to your SRW folder (steamapps\common\SRW30) and in there is a folder called SRW Music. You can place your songs in there, and through the in game feature, set custom BGMs for your units
 3) Borderless Window not implemented properly on Widescreen Monitors. If you are using a Widescreen Monitor, when using Borderless Window it will not expand to the entire screen. If you want to use the fullscreen, you can only use Fullscreen Mode
 4) Fullscreen issues. If you Alt-Tab while in fullscreen, the game automatically changes to window mode. This is an annoyance. (Use hotkeys ALT+Enter to go back into fullscreen)

Overall Rating
This is a decent game that truly pushes the Z engine to what it is capable of, and definitely provides the value for a $60 game. If you are a fan of SRW, and want to finally own a non-OG US copy, this is your game. While there are a few issues, there is enough in this game to make it worth the price.",1635657055,1635771098,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

For the uninitiated, SRW30 is the latest in a line of just under 50 (mostly) SRPG titles (including spin-offs) in a series that started in the early 90s.  It gained notoriety especially as videos of earlier entries were made available on YouTube, showcasing incredible pixel animations of fan-favorite mecha duking it out.  It is the ultimate mech/robot fan's dream, answering burning nerd questions like ""How awesome would it be if Gundam and Getter teamed up?""  Thing is, up until recently, the series has been locked to Japan, so if you wanted to play it, you had to know the language and import the games because Bandai (or Banpresto, back in the day) weren't going to mess with the weird licensing issues West of the border.

Over the last decade, however, interest in the series has grown as the Asia region started getting English-translated (hit or miss) releases for the PS4 and Switch, making it far easier for Westerners to get their grubby hands on the games and enjoy them.  This includes a few releases in the SD Gundam series, of which Cross Rays has been officially released on Steam, as well!  So SRW30 is quite notable for being an officially-released SRW game for Western audiences and thus, lots of fans aren't waiting for a discount to show Bandai that there is indeed a market for the games here, with all the licensing headaches that may be involved.  The only other title that made it here was part of the OG sub-series which features only original content and no licensed stuff (which doesn't mean they suck, btw, so worth tracking down if you care).

So what the heck is it?  Essentially, it's a high-spectacle, low-challenge grid-based SRPG that typically blends elements of established anime robots and mobile suits with a few of Bandai's original creations.  Mostly this involves slotting new characters (weakly) into the plot of your favorite anime series or some you may have never even heard of.  Thing is, most of this stuff comes from the 70s to the 90s and perhaps if you're of a younger age, you might not have any interest in what you're seeing beyond the really slick battle animations.  Fear not, however, as there is extensive character and robot/suit info contained in an easily-accessed encyclopedia that will key you into where these things are coming from so you never really need to feel lost.

What it all really boils down to is that you're getting a fairly-simple grid-based strategy game that doesn't really demand too much thought.  The battle animations are the big showpiece here as they are slick and full of cool effects and high energy, but they start to wear thin after the 5th time you've watched the same attack and they're mostly just masking that there isn't a whole lot going on except lining up your units to take shots.  Sure, there's some resource management stuff going on (manage your energy/ammo), some maps will require at least a decent approach to strategy, and there's a whole bunch of upgrades and special actions that round out the game, but it's pretty straight-forward and won't be much of a challenge unless you pump up the difficulty to the highest setting.

It's not going to be everyone's cuppa, but take a look at the roster of licenses and if you have any interest in seeing them in action, go ahead and get SRW30, but don't pick it up just because you want to see more in the West.  Us crazy-ass fans have (hopefully) got that handled.  Take a look at the other stuff that's available in English (X, V, T, a couple of OGs) and see if those rosters tickle your fancy more.  You get the most out of these games if you are familiar with the licenses that show up and importing the one you'd like most might be worth it.

Honestly, though, it's more than that - it's a bloody MIRACLE. When this game was announced and opened for preorders, the forum was immediately filled with as much bafflement as joy. Up until three days ago, being a fan of the Super Robot Wars series outside of Japan meant either A: That you were a big enough weeb to have actually learned Japanese at least well enough to play expensively-imported JP copies of the games, B: That you'd played the half-handful of SRW titles that have received full fan-translations, in the form of only SLIGHTLY illegal ROMs or C: That you've played the 'Original Generation' spin-off titles, which are the only SRW games to be released overseas. Or B+C, I suppose.

An official release of a mainline SRW-title in the west is impossible - everybody knew that. After all, the whole point of the game is that it's a piece of officially-sanctioned crossover fanfiction bringing together mechas, pilots, ships, monsters and other characters from dozens of different properties. All of which had various overseas distribution contracts attached to them, making any attempt at an English-language release a legal quagmire. How they actually pulled it off with this one, I still have no idea - but they did, somehow.

Now, in principle, I don't preorder games. It's just not a good idea - maybe it'll turn out to be completely different from what you expected, or buggy as all get-out on launch, or just plain BAD. Better to wait for the reviews to be in, and maybe a sale. It's just good sense. This one, though? As soon as it opened for preorders, I did my best ""Shut up and take my money!"" Fry-impression. And guess what? It was everything I'd hoped it would be, virtually bug-free on launch (I've seen ONE, and it was both tiny and entirely cosmetic), and AMAZING. I ain't gonna change my general stance, but... I guess sometimes, you luck out, eh?

So yes, it's awesome. There's loads of strategical and tactical depth to sink your teeth into as you prioritize upgrades to your mothership's systems, your ever-growing arsenal of mechas and your ragtag bunch of misfit pilots - and then decide who to field for any given battle and how to use them there. Go all-out from the word go, or try to conserve energy and ammunition for later challenges? Build up a small elite core of Super-Ace pilots with maxed-out machines, or try to spread the love around? Up to you.

Also, the game is BEAUTIFUL. Compared to some of the older titles, many of the machines have fewer attacks, but the ones they DO have look gorgeous. A mixture of 2D sprites, hand-drawn animation and cell-shaded CG that's honestly better executed than some recent Anime I could mention. The attack animations match the style of the machine's origins, too - like the slightly jerky animation of the RX-78 Gundam's attacks, similar to the 80's anime it came from, and Gridman's overblown faux-Tokusatsu wire-fu moves. Some events even feature actual clips from the anime, like Combattler V's first combining and Deckard's transformation into J-Decker - complete with the kind of mid-80's VHS film-grain that will make any ageing anime-fan's heart sing with sheer nostalgia.

So... with all that praise being sung, any complaints? Eh, I could pick a few nits, if I had to. The game is pretty easy unless you ratchet the difficulty ALL the way up, and if you buy the DLC or preordered, you'll get some bonuses at the start that make the first part of the game even easier. Fortunately, you CAN raise the difficulty any time you choose, but for those looking for a serious challenge, even the highest setting might not be truly satisfying. Also, compared to the older games and Original Generation entries, they dropped the 'Combine' feature altogether - any canonical 'combining robot' is either stuck permanently combined, or has the combination relegated to a single Attack. Likewise, while the Transform-feature IS still in the game, actual transforming robots are incredibly thin on the ground, with many that CAN transform again having it reduced to just being another type of Attack. I find that a bit annoying - even if Transforming or Combining on the map isn't terrible USEFUL, it DOES offer some extra tactical depth, and... well, it's just COOL, ya know?

Still - those are tiny nits picked off a miracle. If you like giant robots and anime about same, buy this game - that's the long and short of it.",1635718890,1635718890,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

You play as a anime hobo with the most fancy scarf and hair ever as you roam across a planet where aliens and uh - Space people I think are attacking Japan.

I can't even comprehend this. Maybe it's because I'm not an anime fan, but this is the most absurd wacky stuff I have ever see and makes zero sense.

------
+ Runs like a dream, even with a potato

-------
- Battle can be too easy, up your difficulty mode
- Yet the commands/stats are complicated; tutorials are sparse
- Old videos and animations may not be touched up; I leave it to your personal taste
- Game may be a bit pricey, so you may want to wait for a sale

For a series that's just as old as Fire Emblem, the basic gameplay sucks in comparison.
The damage you deal is incorrect to what it tells you in the menu, you can't see the health of all your units on the map, but instead you have to hover over them one by one, you can only see the range of one enemy at a time, you can't see which weapons require Move and Fire just through the weapon list, etc.
There's a lot of minor things that add up to a really clunky feel. 
Sure the animations and music are nice, but you get over the hype after you used their attacks more than 3 times.

On top of that the story is voice-less. Only the combat animations are voiced, making the story completely irrelevant to me. And there's currently a bug where the game always opens on the wrong monitor. Nothing you can do about it, except change to windowed mode.

The UI is utter jank. So many convoluted menus just to get to a specific unit ability or weapon description. 

The only saving grace of this game over something like SD Gundam Generation Crossrays is that this game has a self contained story, and your character actively plays a role in that story. A BIG positive. If you liked Crossrays and wished that there was a driving plot line, then get this, but otherwise, I'd pass. 

The animations are worse than Crossrays, the UI is worse, the controls feel worse, the gameplay feels worse, there is no custom character creator, and you can switch the fucking x and o buttons on a ps4 controller so that you aren't confined to a Japanese control scheme. The only reason I'm playing this game is because it's fresh and new, but if you want a quality mecha srpg with roster building, then Crossrays is infinitely better than SRW 30. 

If you're on the fence, get this on a deep sale because the story is interesting, especially since it interweaves a bunch of different universes together and makes it all work narratively.",1635469868,1635549362,False,11,4,0.346231192350387573,5,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Top Notch animation this time around especially for the newcoming mechs that joined the franchise
+ Soundtrack/BGM is somewhat a better upgrade from previous title
+ Autoplay first introduced to the series, very useful for boring grinds
+ Replayability is always good for SRW
+ Free style path option also first introduced, giving players freedom to pick stages they want

Cons:
- DLC price is on the verge of being as bad as Tales of Arise, but awards more content, I still count this as a con.
- Certain Mechs had way less development in terms of animations (i.e. Phoenix Gundam). Meanwhile you have Gridman that seems to have all the budget in the game poured into it. I'm not too ticked by this, but somewhat disappointed.
- Past Titles added into the series are added as season pass

The series included are fun
The animations for the new units are now starting in motion for most attacks which is nice when being the attacking unit. But when counter attacking it is a little jarring to see the old dodge and block and immediately cutting to a motion shot.

For a little more bit of details:
- This game is pricey when compare to the value of the game itself present since the start
- Compare to the previous one in the title like V and T, the overall quality of presentation (attack sequence, transition, animation, text layout etc.) is change from bad to worse. (Good news, it's not the worst among all games in new gen of the series....YET)

And from my perspective, if it didn't have Knight&Magic and MJP in this one, I would bought this game (Ultimate edition) when it had 70-80% discounted. NOT THE FULL PRICE (Of course, Ultimate Edition).

It may seem like an odd thing to get so excited about this kind of thing, but you gotta understand that this series had something of a mythical reputation among anime fans that came up in the 90s. We about it second or even thirdhand, and very few of us were able to get a chance to play it. Until the English Asian editions came out for V, X and T, the best we could get were the old Original Generation Games on the Gameboy Advance. A lot of us mainly got to experience it through watching attack animation clips on youtube. But, nonetheless, despite all the odds, we finally get to experience it for ourselves.

The game, much like it's predecessors, is at its heart part visual novel, and simple strategy RPG. The strategy RPG aspect is simple and fun. You can choose to synergize the myriad offensive, defensive and support skills for some units, to strategically whittle down the enemy. Or, you can simply sending out your most powerful unit to mercilessly annihilate anyone dumb enough to stand against you. The choice is yours. The big attraction is getting to see the attack animations; lavishly animated showcases of the unit's abilities, and in some cases using obscure attacks and weapons that may have only been mentioned in side-materials, or concept art is a joy.

The visual novel part is the hidden pleasure for the fans. Each chapter contains a set of scripted dialogs essentially playing out what would be an entire 24 minute anime episode. Getting to see character interactions between your favorite heroes and villains from different series, and also seeing how their own stories are changed by the interactions is simply amazing. These led to moments and events that people have heard about and discussed for years. Stories of how ""Evangelion's Shinji Ikari becomes a badass because he gets cool friends like Koji Kabuto and Ryoma Nagare!"" or ""SRW somehow made Gundam Seed Destiny's story GOOD!"" Finally getting to have a chance to experience these kinds of What IF style stories instead of just drip feeding off of second hand accounts is amazing. Unlike much hyped ""Crossover Events"" you might see in movies like The Avengers, or your latest Comic Book crossover, it's clear the writers put effort into giving fans the fun experience they want to see. The interactions are fun and sometimes oddly insightful, and they don't devolve into meaningless posturing or snarky comments.

The series lineup for this entry is a solid mix of old school series, long time mainstays, and some new and even unconventional choices. A lot of the gameplay has been refined from the previous VTX trilogy, and the interface is a bit more simplified to make it easier to navigate. I will admit if you're not much for mecha anime, the game might not have a lot for you, but for my part, finally being able to play something that I've literally spent most of my life only hearing about as a distant rumor is an amazing experience.

Super Robot Wars is a tactical turn based RPG series that involves the crossing over of various different mecha (and now Tokusatsu as well!) proprieties into its own original story where these characters stories are bound to be different despite any similarities to their source material due to the new settings and elements. This crossing over of series is a gateway to a variety of interactions that are bound to amuse and entertain, have you ever wanted to see Shinji from Evangelion find a positive male role model from a man known to crush dinosaurs heads with his own hands? Boy, do i have a series for you (this isn't in SRW30 but I'm sure I got your attention now)! SRW is full of this stuff and its witty and fun writing makes for a great time.

For those who may not know tons or even anything at all about mecha, i think you will find no issue with jumping into this series, the in game glossaries will tell you what you need to know about past events and the many characters you'll encounter and you'll never truly feel lost. If anything, I think this series is a great gateway to mecha for newcomers to this genre as you'll get a taste of all these characters and their mechs and the feel of their respective series', so you can find what you vibe with most and perhaps go watch/read their source material afterwards and slowly dig deeper into this genre and the many, many franchises that know that deep down, people just love seeing robots beat stuff up.

The way I would describe this series to my friends who don't know mecha really is is ""It's like Fire Emblem but your waifus are gaint robots"" which may not sound cool but get this. Robots are cool. Giant robots? Even cooler. If you have any interest in tactical RPG's and think what you've heard of this franchise from its fans and the reviews sounds up your alley, I can't stress enough how much i think this game is worth your purchase and time. This is the first time this series has gotten this sort of chance in the west and people like me who've played this series for a long time wish to see SRW continue to get such wonderful western support! So give this game a shot, I believe its a wonderful game for SRW beginners and by the end of the game, you'll be calling out all these attacks names alongside the pilots!",1635492248,1635492275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

now the animation is upgraded from before ( im counting the good animation from Z X and T ) wich is much better, and the personal bgm for the protagonist is now vocaled on everytime i used it at demo on !!! divine beast is favorite.

with the new ""mission"" play, you are not on linear story line, you can do some grind for exp, credits and MxP ( mission xp) for upgrading unit and function to dreistregar the main battleship in this game via the AOS system, and the benefit is so helping if you can reach the max level. even so, you can pick mission to wich one and wich unit to come first, from there, if you already got the unit and play on another mission that rewarding with the receiving new unit, the unit you got from before will have interactive dialog on this new stage regarding the unit you will receive later . example : if you already got combattler V , the character will mention/interact with the stage of Voltus V. the way to progress you main story is by doing the starred mission  . . when is done,  your main story is progressed. this is ver like mobile gaming but for home, just like terada san said, its first system for home use game of srw.

While a lot of the earlier games in the franchise rely heavily on reusing of assets and animations, 30 manages to change things up enough to show why this sequel is truly worth your time.

First off, the series list is pretty good. Shaking things up with some newer anime like SSSS.Gridman and debuting some welcome additions like J-Decker, really make the roster feel fresh. Don't worry, the staples are still here. Koji and the Getter team have not been forgotten. I don't wish to talk much about the roster, as it is entirely subjective. Some people will sorely miss the TTGL crew, while some others welcome a break from recurring series. Subjective. I just personally really dig the narratives they chose for 30. 

The animations still have some jankyness to them. The anime cut ins that you can find in V are still present in some actions. Some of the returning units do show their age and are screaming for a revamp. However, the newer Robots get some stellar animations, I am very partial to the fluid motion Gridman has. I was hoping that 30 was going to be the title where the team went all out in this department. We have a mixed bag of fantastic animations, to some you'll be skipping.

Gameplay is where the most polish is shown. I personally felt like a majority of the maps felt interesting enough to keep my attention. There were a small batch of missions I saw as pointless but it was a small minority. SRPGs' lifeline depends on coherent and challenging map design, this is what makes them replayable. Previous entries have left me wanting in this department, usually depending on route splits or route specific units to create replayability. While this worked, I much rather play the same maps with varying difficulty and challenging designs, than 100+ different chapters with almost no thought put into them. 

30 has some missions that I was excited for, and would gladly replay with a different team. While there are still route splits, you are no longer just forced to play the next story mission. 30 now offers the ability to choose what mission you want to tackle next. This is an excellent breath of fresh air, specially for those looking to recruit their favorite characters early on. However, I can't exactly praise 30 for this, as Fire Emblem was doing this years ago. I can only commend them for finally moving on with the standards. I can certainly say I will be happy to replay this. My main complain would be that I wish each protagonist would get a specific mech.

You won't find an extreme level of complexity here, SRW for all intents and purposes is a simple RPG. 30 does add a few things to spice things up, but if you're looking for a super difficult and deep system, maybe this is not your bag.

From the character designs, the animations and the music, the overall aesthetic of SRW 30 is nothing to scuff at. Sure, there are SRPGs out there that are pushing the boundaries of graphics and art style. But as a mash of a ton of beloved Mecha? SRW 30 accomplishes what it does, it looks like an anime. I highly recommend getting the anime tracks, it really does the game wonders.

Overall, if you love Mecha and SRPGs, then I assume you already bought this. If you love SRPGs, but have no idea what SRW is, or why the Mazinger Z is awesome, I would still check this out. There's a ton of entertainment to be had by all.",1635450751,1635450751,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

About the only units I wish made a return are the G Gundam units (Domon's God Finger / Sekiha Tenkyouken with the new animation would have been awesome IMO) as well as Gundam 00.

Its essentially a traditional turn based tactics game, you move your available units around a square grid map with varying objectives that are usually dont die while wiping out the enemy, pretty straight forward.

All the mechs and characters who pilot them have progression mechanics, and in SRW30 that goes quite deep, with not only traditional levels for the pilots, but two global resource pools for upgrading individual mechs and one for buying stat boosts and new passives for your characters, and then theres another resource for upgrading your flagship, which is meta game mostly aside from some global buffs.

SRW30 takes from its own franchise and from other franchises, such as MSG and Code Geass, and a bunch more that are all listed on the store page, and it mashes them together quite well from what Ive seen so far, so the more familiar you are with any one franchise, the more you will enjoy the mashup, but not being familiar doesnt take anything away and theres also a feature that lets you see encyclopedia entries for things as they are mentioned during dialogue.

The closest SRW has ever gotten to PC is through emulating the 3 games (at least that I know of) that they made in English, out of the heaps more that are purely Japanese, and while there could be some more graphical polish in sprites and, honestly, basic options such as audio, it does cater to the platform with, mostly, well lain out controls.

This games not all core game play though, its a JRPG partly so theres a lot of characters, most well established through their own shows or games, and they all have plenty to say to each other, so half of the game youre going to be reading dialogue boxes for, going by similar and previous SRW games, probably quite a lengthy story, though the game hints that SRW30 might be open ended, turning into a sandbox of sorts.

Biggest complaint, and biggest piece of advice, find and read the tutorials before you start the story, because the option to go to the encyclopedia entry for highlighted words in dialogue (2 btw, but dont press F2 accidentally or youll skip the ENTIRE scene :\), or the fact that your selected birth date and blood type determine your characters ""Spirit"" abilities are things you need to know immediately, and then there are certain things it doesnt explain well, like combination attacks, though they might be obvious and I've just not gotten to that point of the game yet.

If you dont have some irrational hatred for tactics games, anime, a rich story, mechs, or Japan, and you like at least one of those things, this games an easy sell.",1635427397,1635427397,True,2,0,0.527654409408569336,0,True,False,False

Before this it was importing and learning to play a game entirely in Japanese, or more recently importing the English translations released in SEA for the V/X/T games. This however is its own thing. No imports, no need to own a specific console, no need to wait a literal month after release to enjoy it. That alone is worth some bonus points.

Game itself is shaping up well. It's basically Fire Emblem with giant robots that beat the snot out of each other with anime sequence style attacks, that you can speed up or skip entirely if it strikes your fancy so one turn doesn't take 40 minutes. In a departure from the norm in the franchise, you get a World Map and can choose what missions to go on in whatever order you want. So you could go to the recommended level the game is displaying, or you could ignore that because from the blurb of this other mission you've positive one of your favorite machines is tucked away just waiting for you to grab it. For those actually reading this review for guidance, picking the Earth route gives you a vast amount of ""Super"" robots to use, which are big, tanky, slow, and hit with the weight you would expect a 40 meter machine to swing around. Space is where the ""Reals"" are mostly staying, which is where you'll get all your fancy, dodging yet relatively frail Gundam's among other things.

And I can't just NOT mention the music in this, bloody hell. Every series has at least one instrumental remix of their main themes which starts playing when one of their units shows up to knock heads. And there's even a music library to just enjoy if it strikes your fancy. Might I recommend V Gundams ""Stand Up To The Victory"" and GGG VS Bettermans ""Yuusha Ou Tanjou?"" Absolute gems, and Gridman's ""UNION"" is a delight too. Even better there's a custom BGM option! Nice little song from a series didn't make it in officially? Like hell that'll stop you from enjoying it here. Or you could be some kind of memelord and just put whatever nonsense you want on blast, I won't judge.

There's a lot more specifics but the game will do better explaining them than me. Just...Look just get this game, please. If you have any interest in Turn-Based Strategy games or mecha in general you'll get some enjoyment out of this, and if you like both you probably already know this series as well as I do.

Anyways I wasn't sure if this was gonna be a great game with the ""Mission"" system, but i'm really liking it so far. It just feels like every stage is an intermission and the other missions are DLC (the feeling from V,T,X titles)
  
I would suggest using a Controller, PS3, PS4, Xbox something, the Keyboard controls are not the greatest.
Animations are fantastic, and feel much more improved over the last few titles.

The Upgrades for your ship are massive, so many options, all helpful for your adventure. (Personally recommend Lab: AOS Research (MxP) upgrades just so you can theoretically, buy everything faster) 
The previous three titles had 1 upgrade per ""Level"" up to ""Level 5/6"" and then you'd have to start New Game+ to get your 2nd upgrade. This one gives you 8 upgrades per option and 18 options for a total of 144 upgrades that affect everyone or just the ship. 

DLC:
