Pros: Different views in the match and you get replays. It has top of the class transfer negotiations (FIFA doesn't have minimum fee release clause in Spain does it?). It also includes Winter Update, which also edits the transfers as well as updating player ratings and how well they perform and how teams perform, so now Leicester City aren't in relegation zone and are in the top half of the table at least. Training is really realistic, you are able to train them in a positions as well as focus on a specific attribute or player role. Tactics are also in-depth as well as finances, player morale, squads, under-21s, under-18, FC Barcelona B, Real Madrid Castillo. There is also 50 million other stuff like scouting and shortlisting players, and players turning into coaches etc. There is also workshop and Football Manager 2016 Editor so you can make Steam Workshop mods! :)

Cons:
The theme is a bit boring and I haven't found any ones that change the background on the workshop.

A standout problem is the awful injuries that some players receive. A center attacking midfielder wonderkid that is fairly susceptible to injuries randomly picks up ""damaged cruciate ligaments"" in the Champions League final against Manchester City F.C. as his first big injury. Gone for 8-9 months. Don't joke with me. I can understand if he twists a knee or something because it's a month out injured. I quit and restart the game. Don't mess with me, Sports Interactive's game engine. That happened to me in FM2015 to my main striker, and I was dumb enough to save it. Ruined my striker's career. Imagine what would happen if my wonderkid lost a year of development. 

A more realistic change in scouting happened this year, you have no idea whether a youngster has world class potential or not. Back in FM2015, I can understand a 20-rated judging potential scout screws up on a ""world class"" assessment, but in FM2016, every scouting report and in-house coaching report says ""Potential to become First Division player."" Is this some sort of joke? I hire the best scouts (20-rated judging potential ability) with years of experience and that is the best assessment. Do you have no guts to say ""Maybe, this youngster might be world class, boss?"" What a disgrace. Most cases, I find out a player has ""world class potential"" after he's played around two seasons for my first-team squad. I don't care if you say that because by that time if the player's performed well, I already know where he stands in my squad. I don't need some two-year overdue paperwork when I can literally see the stats myself. 

You just have to decide a player's potential with those idiotic star ratings, which were poor in FM2015, but probably worse in FM2016. Four gold stars and one black star, he must be the player with the best potential on your team even world class I daresay, but no, he turns out to be some run of mill, average player on a good day. I often have much worse realities, such as two gold stars in the end. I rarely see a player with four-in-a-half gold stars and half black star rating, which I bet might be a better bet as a world class potential. I have stepped up my own judging ability, so I don't get screwed on expensive transfers of more-or-less probable wonderkids.

Also, think about not using the ""world class"" moniker so much. FInd a better term because the next tier is probably ""Star of the First Division"" or something like that, which could be improved. In scout reports, maybe ""Champions League quality player"" or ""Europa League quality player"" or ""superstar quality player"" might be slightly more accurate. 

I still recommend this game because it's still playable with its faults, and this is one of my favorite games. This is a visible improvement over FM2015 with more realistic transfers and better AI opponents. I have read those horrible reviews of FM2017, and I am a bit worried. The only other FM I played was FM2015, but FM2016 is definitely the best FM in my books.",1482813245,1482813282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Improvements should be made on this aspect.

The media interviews will get boring after a while and feels pointless. Responses you give doesnt show a noticable impact on your gameplay.

Crazy results (Beating Barcelona 7-0 at the Nou Camp, then Real Madrid 8-2 at the Bernabeu...), retarded gameplay mechanics at times (Seriously you want that red card so bad? 2 minutes in, and all you wanna do is lunge in with the dumbest tackle ever?), the yellow and red card amounts are staggering and unbelievable, no matter what tactics I use my team regularly gets 3 yellow cards a game, sometimes twice on the same player... It makes for a frustrating experience at times.

The morale mechanics, contracts, transfers and overall tactics, as far as I can tell, have improved drastically. My tactics actually feel like they're making a difference (Aside for certain cases like stated above), and I love it. 

The game engine looks better and plays the same as 15', trading in new bugs for fixing older bugs - But overall this game makes for a very fun gaming experience.

I brought this game despite fully understanding its addictive nature (you could say this was a relapse). The last football management game I possessed was 2002 where a young me would spend hours watching and shouting at pixelated men in competition with local rivals for that last 6th position playoff spot in division 2 (Which wasn't achieved and the game was buried....).
Well for FM2016 (as the kids call it) you do feel more of a relation to the real modern game. If you support 'normal underachieving' everyday football team as myself (because you were raised up to/encouraged to support your roots and keep the hope..ect) on the right settings I'm happy to inform you can relive the same anguish, disappointed, ups and downs you get every Saturday as a fan at the same time seeing the perspective of your under the cosh running out of excuses manager. 
There you are, had a good strong start, made that important signing from a good proportion of your budget has a few great matches with your specialist yet slightly risky 4-3-3 formation, yet to find few games on he has a nasty 18 month injury. Anyway things start to just wobble so you make a few tweaks/consolations to help but things start going a bit more south and to worsen morale that player you thought you wouldn't use which you sold with no sell on fee is doing pretty well in a FA cup quarter final which you exited round 3 (""Just concentrating on the league"" we tell ourselves). And all of a sudden with the chairman breathing down your neck you start thinking, ""how did I have it setup before?? wish I saved it..."" and ""might move teams...""

All in all, like before I've played hours and hours now and like before I have no regrets and you shouldn't too. These games may not process the quality in graphics and gameplay as FIFA or PES (never expect that from FM) but the endless amount of strategy, options, care and attention you can add it can accommodate everybody's level of skill. Soooo relapse with me people! Relapse! Football give in to it!

After that the team turned to crap and there was no way to fix it. Id bring in many solid players, few solid players, change formation, listen to the assistant coaches advice and change focus but nothing ever worked.

I struggled the whole game with different saves. Always conceded goals on counter attacks, no matter what high or low line I had and best or worst players. It's still a cool game. But I always played it and stopped because I got frustrated a lot. 

The reason I'm saying this is because I'm not one of this youtubers or streamers that play FM and only FM and figure out every single stuff in the game (aka the ME, Match Engine). I'm that guy passionate about football that like other games too. And to be honest this version of FM was the best in terms of up to date stuff about real football but imo the worst on gameplay experience (because of the struggles).

I still got about 650hs on it, my most played FM ever to date. This because I love challenges. But there are stuff that need changes and upgrades ASAP, like the training, the user friendly interface, like the tips for beginners or the help from the AI coaches because many of the stuff on FM has not that friendly user interface for beginners and that is something I always got annoyed by the series.

Other stuff is, if you understand REAL Football and study it, this doesn't mean you can be successful on FM. So that propaganda/marketing about real people using FM on clubs is just about the players attributes and stuff. Not the match engine for example. FM has a pretty good scout network that a lot of clubs use to get understanding of players they can't afford to scout.

Anyway, I as for today would not recommend this game for a newcomer. For a veteran yes. This game made me open my eyes to the series as for I'm not buying it on pre-order anymore and will not buy it every year, specially FM17. A lot of things have to change to make the game more realistic and more accessible and understandable. It's not like real football of FIFA/PES where you just watch a game and understand the logic behind the match engine. There is a lot more involved.

I will recommend the game because it is good. Has the up to date stuff from 2016 and FM17 doesn't have many changes compared to this one (from the announcements and watching people playing on streams) but the counter attacks are extremely aggressive imo. So be aware of the rage you are going to get with this game.",1476024599,1476822682,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The comparison between past entries in the series is one of the more popular yet I feel it does this game an injustice. My experience with FM 2016 has been very positive and it will take numerous edits to produce a review that includes all aspects of the game.

The main improvement is the feeling of true 'understanding' that builds as you play the game. At first inheriting a new squad is very daunting and can be tumultuous at the start of the season, you check scout reports identify weaknesses and yet these do not mean the be all and end all of a successful squad. Personality is now a key factor in squad cohesion and this is the first game in the series where they have really pulled it off. Not only this but the revamped tactics, which I didn't really like in 2015, actually make sense in accordance to the players now. It really does feel like you grow into the game and your squad grows with you.

The only way I can 'prove' this is through experience. I began a multiplayer save as Chesterfield sitting in League 1 of the football championship in England, the squad is ok, one player thought he was too big for the club and moved on to a higher league. I brought in loan signings who combined with my 4-2-3-1 strategy perfectly in a blend of speed and power that saw my team unexpectantly promoted in the play-offs. Next year I thought would be a big struggle, indeed it was yet I changed my formation to a solid 4-1-3-2 and brought in big midfielders and a new target man. I began to grind out results and realised this is the first time the football manager series has challenged me in such a way. My squad personality of 'determined' with many of the players having high work rate and teamwork mattered just as much as my refining the tactics and set pieces, whereas in past entries I would train a formation and never have to be reflexive in order to counter specific threats. Players stats used to determine so much and now that this has been toned down, buying and selling really takes far more nouse to be successful.

The graphics leave a little to be desired but perform their role. Sometimes the match engine makes it look like your players have lost all ability to play but if you look at the stats, how confident they are feeling and the specific feedback from your assistant you can be reflexive and resolve the issue before the match is lost. It really does feel like every decision has an impact on unlocking defences or solidifying your own. To this, the display does a very adept job.

I got promotion to the premier league with a squad of roughnecks and man mountains and got thouroughly deconstructed by almost every team. (barring Newcastle who I did the double over, lol) It was disheartening but also so very real, my solid wall wasn't paying off at the highest level so I reverted to buying smaller yet more skillful players, a few greek players to create a solid understanding between my foreign talent and the english core of the squad and two top class championship strikers. The 4-2-3-1 was back with a vengeance and we even had Sergio Romero the former Argentine international between the sticks, at Chesterfield!

The changes paid off over two seasons and many of the squad had each other and me, the manager as their 'favoured personel'. With this we regained our promotion and won our first trophy, the feeling was so much more sweet than past victories in any other footballing sim or any title. The story is there, different players react to each other in unique ways and this is the first game in the series where true understanding comes from more than just 'stats'. 


For these reasons I can safely say that this is the best entry in the series so far and I've played since 08. It might be worth waiting for the next rendition but this game would be a great purchase regardless.

with each release and update this game (series) has got worse and worse, its become less realistic, more clearly offside goals allowed for opponents and clerly onside goals for ANY team i use dissallowed as offside, less develeopment from players, clearly underrated players especially youth in lower leagues, very unrealistic injuries and far too many, transfer fees wanted for players unrealistic, players wanting extremely high wages despite not deserving them, players complaing about not being given promised playing time despite not being key players, several players requesting transfers for not playing enough (during post season) despite playing every game they was available for in season, games clearly focused on fmt mode but yet you cannot use the ingame editor feature even to view hidden stats at very least, game should have been cancelled instead of FIFA Manager this is way more buggy than that ever was, some of my earlier releases did not transfer to steam saying the licences were already in use by another user, i have serious doubts about buying this game ever again whilest it is just getting worse and being the only remaining football manager game that is even slightly good says a lot bad about this genre.
i do not recommend this game especially when other games like fifa are making serious progress with main game and improving both manager and player modes, on top of that the mobile version having to pay for half of the challenges is ridiculous and i will not be purchasing another mobile or tablet etc version while there are better FREE manager games available.
FM has been on a serious downfall since FM10 though some of the advancements in layout etc have been improved.
Theres been virtually no changes in the talks etc which gets boring and almost always leads to weird responces from players for example i saved before a game started it and in prematch used all options and aggresively demanding the players perform got better motivation than passionatly asking the team to show why they were favourites as promoted both run up to match amd pre match commentary thing",1473021257,1473021257,False,25,2,0.588014006614685059,18,True,False,False

On the other hand, exploit all the flaws of the game engine, get your troop with top morale, beat any opposition, take over the world with the worst team ever. Yay, great game, or maybe not.

1. Overpowered crossing - This is by far the biggest issue with this game. Near on 80% of ALL goals scored, for and against seem to originate from crosses. This is regarless of what your tactics are. I don't think much needs to be said other than play two or three seasons and have a look at Hector Bellerin's stats. I will happily bet my house, car and family that he has more assists than Ozil, and is consistently in the top 5 average rating for the league. Other attacking full backs; Gaya, Alba, Marcelo, Walker will have similar stats. This is a huge issue for the game creators and MUST be worked on for the next version.

2. Regens - This has been a long-running fixture in the SI wishlists. Though I acknowledge some slight progress has been made here, theres still plenty to be desired. There are too many youngsters that are too similar. The obvious example is with strikers. It is extremely rare, if not impossible, to find a striker who doesn't have great finishing (17), good first touch (14+), poor technique & composure (8) and is about 6' 2. Also, with wingers, now-a-days it's unusual to find an 'old school winger' who plays the the same side as his preffered foot. This is not reflective on the game and there are not nearly enough 'inside forwards' that come thhrough. I think SI need adapt witht the changing game, I wouldlike to see many more regens able to play on either wing with differing comfortability. Also, there needs to be some collaboration with attributes. E.G. you'd have a regen who is quick and good at dribbling, but then has something like 9 flair, poor agility and poor balance. Outside of maybe Jordan Ibe, I don't think this ever happens in real life. 

3. Player interactions - some of the reactions players have are just too unrealistic, and regardless of player personality, they all seem to react the same way. To the stage that whenever I interact with any player now I have to give the same responses. Normally around playing time, where I would love to promise some of the squad players cup-game time, or promise to bring them off the bench, I actually have to tell them 'x' is in the form of his life because thats the only option they react well to.

I'd be interested to learn some thoughts on the above before continuing..",1472538275,1472538275,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As somebody who hadn't played since the 2011 edition, it was exactly as I remember it: Addicting, realistic and with a slightly kinder interface than before. To be fair guys, this is the kind of game where bringing new features or drastic changes isn't going to work. You know what you're getting each year, and that's why we love it. Bar a few minor changes to the interface or button choices based on previous feedback, there's not much to change.

No matter how many features this game may have, no matter how many little details you may have 'control' of, the entire game comes down to the actual engine used to play the 'games' within the game i.e. the whole point of playing the fucking game; quite simply put, the engine used to run the games is so bad as to be pathetic. Balls will run in random directions, players will stand still while the opposition, or even the ball itself, casually runs past and for no apparent reason, normally world class players will suddenly become incapable of hitting the target. 
It does not matter how good you are at tactics or preparation, how much attention to detail you pay in getting your team prepared, in the end the result seems to be down to a piss-poor random number generator. This game results in a complete time-suck with no reward at the end of it. There are literally flash games made better than this one.

As if the game simulator wasn't punishment enough, the lack of proper licensing in the game really draws any real pleasure that might be achieved out of this game. It might not seem a big issue for some, but for an established franchise such as this you expect more, and it just leaves me feeling like I've spent money on a cheap browser-based game. This feeling only exacerbated over the sheer procedural nature of the game; there is obviously such a narrow path as what is ""correct"" that removes any real choice in this game.

If you have a short temper, are easily frustrated or just have a low tolerance for piss-poorly determined game engines, I would suggest avoiding this game if only for it's utterly crap implemented game simulator.
I would suggest avoiding it altogether because of the completely cheap and lazy feel to almost every element of the game.

This is probably the only game where I've gotten to 100 hours in about 2 months of playing, and I haven't done that since Civilization V.  

I enjoy this game, I really do, but a good chunk of the time it irritates me and confuses me. The irritation comes from the AI in the matches. Both home and away. These are some of the worst AI I've ever seen in a game. You don't just walk into somebody and expect a tackle to occur. And the missed goals. The missed goals make me so angry. 

But, with every annoyance I have encountered with Football Manager, theres always a happy and amazing moment (for me at least). An example for me is playing with Oxford City F.C. You wouldn't expect much out of this low English division team, but when I began my adventure in this game, they were the first team I chose. What a ride of emotions I had. I was angry, happy, sad, and confused during my playthrough. I won the FA Trophy with this team against a team from a higher division, and I was so proud/happy for my team. 

If I could rate this game out of 10, I'd give it a 7.5. Give it a try if you're a football fan, a mangement simulation fan, and if you're an armchair manager so to speak.

Football Manager in a nutshell

My team manages 20+ shots at goal most games but only manage to score 1 or 2 goals while the opposition will regularly score with 2-3 chances.

Football Manager, indeed, is a game for niche player base. The prerequisite is that you love football AND management, since if you don't you'll find it challenging to even start, no, I mean to buy the game. The gameplay is mostly the same (oh no, no pew pew purple beam here, so action game lover can't expect anything), without major changes in its core. At the very basic, this iteration is no different than previous Football Manager incarnations - the only major constant change is players/clubs data.

[u]User Interface[/u] 
User interface for this 2016 version is using direct link-Left Sidebar style. Some older versions used collapsible Sidebar (for nested 'Main Squad, U21, U18 for example), but none can be found in this 2016. Most major important elements are directly listed in the sidebar, but as it's limited in space due to it not being collapsible anymore, you'll be hard pressed to find some hidden or nested settings. One notable example is when trying to find ""youth intake"" list  requires me to move my cursor at least to *gasp* 4 different positions to expand dropdown/submenu, not to mention it's very hidden in obscure position. Definitely could use some UI improvement for the next iteration of FM.

If you're FM veteran this UI should be adaptable. But if you're new player, you'd need the help function in-game in order to even understand the menus.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
Almost no change than previous iterations. It's slowly expanded, but the basic premise of the game is for you to be a manager, control a club, train players and manage it. There are more updates introduced like more complex press conference, expanded contract negotiation screens and player interactions (man, I hate players complaining non stop about their contracts and their teammates' issues), but it's more like additional contents, the basic stays the same.

[u]Match engine[/u]
Frankly, the engine has evolved alot, be it UI and functionality. While the changes are ok as it makes things clearer to read (text-based info) than previous FMs, the main focus is the evolution of so called 3D match engine. I will not cover accusation from FM playerbase about AI cheating, as it cannot be proven with cold, hard truth without digging the codebase, but I can definitely say the 3D match engine is dumb. This isn't 2005, where this FM2016's match engine belongs. SI should stick with text based or even moving dot ala FM2009's. It is really aggravating looking at stiff players' gestures (imagine Playstation's Winning Eleven that's decade old already), incredibly weird ball physic / players pitch movement and all around display logic glitches.

I'd rather for 3D engine to be ditched to be quite honest. Better don't try anything than trying half assed thing like that.

[u]Replayability[/u]
Practically endless. You can try different leagues, teams, nations on a whim. You can even set up your own challenge by controlling minor/amateur club and getting that club promoted to EPL. If you can, though.

[u]Performance[/u]
So far in the latest save game, I've had at least 1 crash each season with medium database selected with 4 leagues active. Acceptable, and can be countered by saving often and letting autosave does its job so you don't lose your progress due to crash. 

For the game performance itself, it runs flawlessly @ 60 FPS on my limited i5 Broadwell, 8 GB RAM and 840m. The game requires processor more than graphic card, and it's good they're keeping it that way.

There's an idiotic bug though. If you use other settings than Borderless Window, you'll most likely be hit with black start up screen (FM forum contains bunch of people complaining about it). There's a workaround, but based on the game's lifecycle, this won't receive further patches or updates (12/6/2016 as this moment of writing), so you gotta bear with it if you have issues with the game.

Overall, Football Manager fans can expect the same if not better experience than when playing 2015 version.

(if you can ignore the bugs and glitches)

I would like to start this review by saying that ""This game is my life."" 

I've been playing Football Manager Games since early 2000s and FM 2016 was by far the most satisfying one so far. 

Football Manager 2016, is a football team management game that you can basicly have full control on your team. Literally. It has a massive database, which is created by scouting and observing the real life football teams and players. You'll definetely feel like that you're in charge of your club, just like in real life. In FM 2016, there are some new features such as ""Create Your Own Club"" different from the other games of the series.Set Pieces Wizard is now way more detailed and complicated which allows you to have more control over them.  There isalso  an easier game mode which you'll just be responsible from the tactics and transfers. For those, who don't like details or simply don't have much time to play. There are way more new features implemented in the game that i won't be able to fit in here. So i'm just going to hit Pros & Cons

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

If you're just starting out on Football Manager games, this is still a good game to pick up. There are some really fun features in the game that you can enjoy as extra, other than the simple ( deeply complicated ) football management. [/b]

If you're a football fan and like management/simulation games, this will be your new gem. You'll get hooked up with it immediately. So go ahaed, and buy it. You don't even need to consider or read reviews.

Have been playing since CM '93/Italia, but the last few editions made me lose my interest. I feel a passenger in this game. Out of control, just following the story as it unfolds. There seem to be no tactical depth left other then formation, some shouts and a ton of statistics that are hard to figure out and don't seem to reflect what i see in the 3D engine. 

Team talk, the super boring and never ending repeating press talk that still isn't adding anything of value or immersion to the game, have way too much impact on the performance of your team. So your team is much better on paper than the opponent, on a roll, but because i make one wrong comment they lose all morale and ability to pass a ball over 2 meter? Suddenly they behave like imbeciles? And it's not an incident. It's the ""law"" if you choose the wrong team talk pretty much. There's no freedom in approaching this. So why even offer it?

In the simple version you don't have the teamtalk (yay!), but then you even feel less in control sadly when things go sideways since that tactic side of the game is the weakest to date in FM history. Nothing seems to make sense to me using these ""Shouts"".  

The 3D engine in general is much better then before, but still far away from anything realistic. Playing on the highest leagues seeing players frequently unable to pass a ball back to their keeper, run the ball over de sidelines or other imbecile behaviour is just plain annoying. In fact, that the 2D view still is the most valuable says a lot about the lack of improvement of the 3D engine. Because come on guys, it's been years to improve. Like i've been saying for years: just work together with Fifa or PES to get anything going. This is just pointless.

I just miss any feeling of control. I have to cope with the 101 psychology that FM put into the game. Being different from that view seems to be always wrong and it's still the same multiple choice as years ago. Just  learn the system and follow the rules FM gives you. I'm trying to get it - which is hard, because it's sometimes far from what i consider logical. The bottom line is that you just look up the ""rule sheets"" from the community to ""crack the code"". It's far from what once was a fine Football Manager.

Tactics have been rendered down to plain shouts. Which would be fine if it gave you some feeling of control, but it's agian more of trial and error until it ""clicks"", which is just the same as the slider era, without any real logic. How come i have towering defenders that keep conceding goals from crosses by losing headers and setting more pressure and a highter line, even though they are slow as sh*t and don't even have high position or anticipation rating, seems to be working much better? It's just hopeless. A quest to ""the click"". Not common sense. And any good idea can still be rendered completely unsuccesful because of a wrong answer on a press conference or team talk. Because ofcourse, all of your professional players (and yes, my squad has a ""professional"" character), are a bunch of babies in this game and turn into complete imbeciles after 1 bad comment.

Also i seriously hate the micromanagament this FM suddenly adds. And i don't mean in terms of the usual slider management and that stuff, but application issues. Why do i have to reset all set piece takes after i load a saved tactic from the same team? Why can't i not load any set pieces files (ffm files) etc? There are serious bugs in the game, and it's almost a year and a lot of updates later. Very annoying. It would give me so much more patience by a much more improved interface and functionality. 

Worst of all, if you have issues there is nobody from SIgames willing ot listen. My account was from the forum was gone, it existed, but it didn't send a forgotten password mail. Creating a different account i wasn't able to report bugs and stuff. Just a circle i couldn't break. So i gave up, and the game as wel. No fun, at all!

Anything with the set piece managing is just very annoying and very badly done. I keep tweaking it. Especially if you change a lot due to the insane high amount of injuries. It's like a never ending micromanagement cycle before you can start your next game. It makes the game and the gameplay flow so slow.

I'm just very dissapointed. I've purchased all versions to date, haven't played most of the latest editions, and gave 2016 a serious go, but it's just not fun anymore. It will be my last FM untill i read more possitive feedback from the community (because i'm luckily not the only one dissapointed). Most of my friends and group i used to play with lost interest by now.",1469404529,1469406095,False,38,3,0.752625823020935059,1,True,False,False

This game has been extremely challenging to me since I do not know all of the details of the sport. I have had to do a ton of research and have started several teams before I finally started to figure out how to field a competitive team and make worth while adjustments at crucial times.

Having said all that; this game is amazing. It is so detailed and so realistic that I have learned a ton about the sport and am now a huge fan of soccer. I am actually buying a tv package this month so I can start watching the english premier league.

I love the fact that you can really learn to develop your youth system to create a dynasty. For me personally it gives the game a high replay ability. I personally hired a Director of football and have him as well as my head of youth football run certain aspects of the club just to take a few things off my plate, but the cool part is you can be as involved or univolved as you want.

If their are any cons to the game they are few and minor. The game graphics are not very good, but that is understandable when you realize how massive this game is. If you are rookie in this sport you will struggle in this game for awhile before you begin to understand it, but it is definetly worth it.

If you want a well-constructed sports management sim, play Out Of The Park Baseball; if you want to have fun playing football, get this year's (or any year's) FIFA.

I think FM2016 tries to do too much. The ""match engine"" is a particular victim of this; it's little more than a visual aide for the math by which the game determines results, which often leads to impossible passes, baffling goalkeeping displays, and players who literally stand around doing nothing when the ball rolls gently past them. I don't know how much randomness is involved, but the whole thing could be run on an RNG and I wouldn't be shocked. They want it to be a good representation of the sport, but the graphics are hideous and players don't behave organically. Honestly, I would be more engaged by a static top-down view of the field that rattled off play-by-play down the side of the screen.

The core elements of the game are dense and unforgiving, with a steep learning curve for novice players. Feedback from assistant coaches - even ""good"" ones - is unhelpful and frequently makes things worse when their suggestions are implemented, but it's also the only way to know your tactics are working, since the game doesn't display training results for players in anything resembling a straightforward manner. Half the options for communicating with players on or off the field are useless. Half the data the game compiles on those players is also useless, and good luck parsing out the information you need in the game's sprawling, unwieldy menu system.

Having said that, some elements of the management side are okay. The transfer system more or less works, scouting is clunky but ultimately fine, and it's easy to handle off-field expectations from fans, the board, and the press. Ultimately, though, that's not enough to save the game from its flaws.

It feels like Sports Interactive is trying to have its cake and eat it too with this game. They want to make a management sim, but they also stuff it with a bunch of bloat that weighs it down and prevents them from focusing on things that could actually be helpful to players.

This game is like all the other FM, if your winning its too easy, theres no challenge, you get bought by some tycoon and you buy your way to the top. Easy.


However if your're not winning its because your team forgets how to play football, there are no close matches, no agonising defeats, only stupidity from your players and perfection from the opposition. Your players give up totatly, never chasing loose balls, never winning second balls,failing to tackle, shooting straight at the keeper, slowing play down to a crawl when they could break, passing straight to the opposition, having no pressure on them in the box and hoofing the ball for a corner or throw in, not getting to balls that could be kept in, always being muscled off the ball. The opposition will do everything in the opposite way, they make no mistakes, the perfect box clearance is a hair pulling annoyance. It feels like the game cheats and forces results no matter what you do, your team will make every mistake possible and the opposition will not.

This ofcourse happens in real like (England Euro 2016, WC 2014 etc etc) but in the game it feels forced, like your players are either swtiched on or off, they either breeze to victory or they turn over and surrender, theres no fight anymore. It used to be that you could change tactics for a match, but now your players seem unable to do anything outside of the tactic you've drilled for the past 5 years.

I supose the worst thing about FM16 and the way the series is going is that it doesnt feel like football anymore.

Pros:

* Great in-depth gameplay
* Lots of information about many different leagues
* Ability to get as deep into the nitty-gritty of your team's management as you want to (down to exactly what your set pieces look like)
* Ability to leave things to the AI and just play the matches and make the transfers, if that's all you want to do

- way too many injuries 

- i can not understand why the players got angry so much often , a player came to me with not enough play time , ok i  admit i didn't played him too much , so i did started him in 5-6 matches either league or cup or european again he was much more mad and wanted to leave ..... only God knows what to do with that one ... aw and the extra 8 more players was not happy because he was angry and they wanted to leave too , here goes my team , i got released of my contract :S way to go 

- anyone knows a way to beat Pepe Guardiola ???? I tryed everything , even i cheated , with the cheat all my players was at 20 max in all stats , no injuries , everyone happy and loved each other they also bought cookies to each other and felt the love so , we played the correct tacs aaaaaaaaaaaand  ..... 4-1  loss :S :S :S WTF is going on with the teams that have Pepe as coach.
Next season Pepe went on Man City , i played them in Euro Cup (yea with the fail team of mine of cheaters :P ) and again i had 25 !!!!! Shots on Target , and the score Man City - My Team 5-1 :S :S :S :S :S :S

And then, when you're done cursing SI and ragequitting, the cycle starts over again, you play 8 hours straight again, miss your shift at work, get fired, lose your girlfriend and get kicked out of your apartment, but it's worth it because you took Middlesbrough or some other sh*t team to the CL-final, and it only took you like 12 seasons.

I knew how to make a tactic that could beat a specific opponent, I knew how to manage players, I knew how to handle player condition and training.

In FM16, granted I haven't played FM14 and FM15, it seems that everything I knew has been thrown in the dumpster. Everything seems random. In matches it looks like every half the game flips a coin to decide which team will get total domination. And when a team has total domination literally every scoring chance is for them, while the other team just defends for the entire half.

No matter what tactic I use, no matter what players I use, no matter how I manage my players' morale, it seems like everything boils down to that one coin flip before every half. It also doesn't help that when it's my own team dominating, they will just miss every occasion, while the opponent's domination will always result in a few goals.

I have tried a few careers and it always starts with me losing like 5 games in a row while completely dominating on possession and clear cut chances, and then I randomly win a game 4-0 against a top team. Nothing seems to make sense anymore. I'm touching sliders that affect the game's RNG but I have no way anymore to predict HOW they will affect the RNG.

This results in a very frustrating experience where you win some games and lose some games but you never know WHY. Everything is so random it's almost impossible to make conclusions about the choices you made. Changed a striker for another and won? It could be a billion other factors you mostly have no power over.

Also the players have become absolute princesses and will moan about leaving anytime something goes even slightly wrong or when they start performing above average.

I understand how this can be considered like a realism improvement, because in real life there's just many parameters you have no influence over, and players actually have their little egos, but maybe, just maybe, a GAME shouldn't be all about realism and should sacrifice some of it in favor of fun and rewarding gameplay.

FM16 however has no such enjoyability. It feels like playing a game that doesn't just change it's tactics to counter yours, but rather just handicapps you with a ridiculous plethora of red cards, suspensions, injuries - all occuring to best players at important times. It doesn't matter if you set players to 'stand off', or if you watch their training like a hawk. If the game wants you to lose, you will lose. Some of the AI moves are also so ridiculously moronic (and seemingly recycled from the days of FM11 handheld) that I'd question the programme's sanity - or their scripting intentions. 

I'll give an example of me restarting the same game three times. Champs league qualifier. Best two attackers out inexplicably for a month on u23 duty (cheers for that, not like we worked all season for this)

Attempt 1: Captain sent off for a two-footer in first 10 minutes, striker injured on 60th.
Attempt 2: Keeper scored an OG by punting it in off back of CB's head. Winger sent off for verbal abuse (SERIOUSLY?) in 77th. 
Attempt 3: Didn't even get to the game (quicksave was 2 days before game) and best CB and striker injured in pre-match training. Replacement CB sent off in 14th for another two footer. Concede 2 in last 3 minutes one of which the 4* keeper just stood and watched trundle past like an absent minded giraffe.

My tip if you're buying this is to never, ever buy a player who is even slightly susceptible to injuries. They'll see the physio more than the pitch.

I can understand that this won't be everyone's experience; and hey, maybe I'm just on a really bad run of luck. Though after 300 hours, and three game saves, i'm starting to wonder when this seemingly 'bad luck' is going to end.

The last one I played was 2014 (the 2015 edition was the first I have skipped since the game launched back in the early 1990's)

There are just not enough upgrades to justify making a purchase if you own an earlier version of the game. Yes, they have slowed things down considerably, especially when it comes to transfers and scouting. Gone are the days of looking at a player and buying him right away, now you have to scout him multiple times to get all of the information you need, this is a good thing, sadly the game engine is still the weak point of the game.

It seems that 90% of goals scored against you come from a deep cross out wide, where a player at the far post taps the ball into the goal. Your keeper and defenders are incapable of clearing crosses. It doesn't matter what formation you (or your opponent) use, that is how goals will happen. And then add the ""the keeper will be disappointed to concede at his near post"" EVERY TIME that happens (a bit of variety please) makes watching the matches annoying at times.

Of course, if you have not played a Football Manager game before (or it's been a long time since you have) the 2016 edition is a great jumping on point to get you into the swing of things, but really, S.I. need some big new ideas to keep the the game moving along, because after 20+ years, the franchise is starting to stagnate.",1467588218,1467588218,False,2,0,0.50519031286239624,0,True,False,False

This version isnt any different. Bought this crap on sale, thinking, surely theyve ironed out all the crap by now...nah same things. 

BUT if you enjoy watching players standing around, completely oblivious that theyre in a football match, where they occasionally put one foot infront of another.

What to watch out for:
- Corners. Crosses come in, everyone stands still...the ball hits player in the nuts, then trickles over the line! Amazing..when its your team :p

-Freekicks. Freekicks are fatal on this game when theyre around the half-way line. Kicker takes, everyone stands still except given striker who has an empty net. Goalkeepers are always on hand to pick the ball outta the net.

-Man-love. Players of opposite teams often hold hands while tussling for the ball. Im not anti-gay or anything, but leave it off the pitch chaps!

-Headers. One player will sometimes run into an heading position, but will often forget to jump an challenge for the ball. Insane when you have a player like Andy Carrol upfront for you..right?

-Fitness. Players dont seem to be governed by the laws of nature in this game. You will often see them with a RED (universal colour for meaning knackered) fitness bar, but continueingly sprinting around like usain bolt. Actually..sometimes they appear to move at around 40MPH..but thats another thing all together!

+ Plenty, PLENTY more...check it out for yourself LOL.

Now I know the match-engine doesnt portray exactly what is shown, but this is exactly what it should show! Im left thinking the game is shit..when really its not..its the match-engine that lets it down. An im affraid it hasnt changed a single bit for a long time.

Bear in mind that you won't control the players, only as the manager, hiring staff, buying players, so if you're more of a FIFA player, think twice.

They have changed the way you set up tactics in a way that is pretty much dumbed down for the average joe who doesn't really understand how to play soccer.  Depending on how skilled your coaches are, they will give awesome advice to help you dominate in games; or just barely squeek by with a win.  Then you can go back to the tactics that they recommend and see exactly how they came to such a conclusion by investigating your opponents formations.  I have noticed that far that the Coach recommends Route 1 on teams with an exhausted defense.  Assuming one has forwards that are substantially fast... this will allow one to put and easy point on the scoreboard at least once; the CPU will likely tighten up their defense after that (Park the Bus).  It's exciting and a bit overwheming but in my case... this game has always been intimidating and overwhelming...  but this is the first version of the game where I feel like I am actually learning a little bit about tactics; which all in all is exactly what I love about Soccer/Futbol.

I tried this version the game but it was ridiculously hard. I was managing Everton. the team started the season with 5 players seriously injured more than anyone else but it was still a strong squad. I also signed a Brazilian wonderkind and 2 Brazilian internationals to cover for injuries.
The day after i confirmed Jagielka as captain, the 33 year old suddenly declared had ambitions to play in the Champions League. As you may no Everton is woefully short of defenders and certainly would be unable to sign one his of quality. So I had to ride that out. Then Barkley decides he wants to leave on transfer dealine day. Everon have plenty of central midfielders but a lot of them are injured so I told him to wait a year. He was unhappy. More injuries to defenders followed with 2 unfit midfield players demanding that they play despite not being fit. Most of these were accompanied by threats to disrupt their colleagues. I had to call several team meetings to calm them down. Next John Stones knocked on my door - I tried several appraoches with him loading and reloadingthe game - but every single one of them resulted him carrying out his threat to disrupt the team. Again a meeting, again all but a couple agreed with me. I was surprised then when at the next game half the team was still unhappy about my treatment of John Stones. I selected a team still of high quality with players playing in exactly the position they wanted minimising the number of those who were upset. Half-time score: Everton 1 Bournemouth 5!!!!! I had already suffered more than my fair share of sendings off despite have committed the least fouls in the league, the goals conceded were often huge defensive errors and if I scored I normally conceded within in a minute or 2. I had goalless draws at Chelsea and City and gave good performances against Arsenal and Liverpool. I was not even in the bottom 5 when I received a vote of confidence.

So if you want to play a random game which is playing against you from the outset then this is for you. The game is hard enough anyway without the nonsense and if they think the game engine represents realistic football with top class players constantly appearing to bounce off players heels. Actually I went on holiday for a day and Everton won 3-0 using my selection and tactics - funny that. BTW selling players appears not to have improved in 5 years.

I just don't see how they can't sort out the same old problems, considering they must be getting thousands upon thousands of complaints, all saying more or less the same thing ...

- 90% of one-on-ones are missed.

- 90% of goals come from crosses.

- 90% of the time a player will completely ignore a team mate who would have a simple tap-in, instead choosing to either slam it against the woodwork, wide, or straight at the keeper.

- 90% of games you will have say 15 shots on target; the opposition will have 1 or 2 and you will draw or lose.

- There's too many injuries

- Inane, repeptitive press conferences, and now they've introduced an extra one in the tunnel just to wind you up some more.

... I could go on, but everyone knows all this anyway.

Very frustrating and disappointing, considering how great this game used to be.

This year's edition is decent. The match engine works quite well now I have to say.

Transfers are STILL too expensive, though understandable considering how the transfer market has changed since my first ever FM (2011)

The UI is a lot better than 15's. A lot more refined and with more stats you care about.

My only gripe? Leicester got relegated in 2017 in my save, therefore very unrealistic right now.

All jokes aside, if you never played an FM game before you might want to pick this one up (Or wait until 17 comes out and be inevitably unplayable until next March). If you already played FM 2015 and haven't picked this up, I reckon you should wait until there are major changes because this game really feels like FM 2015 came out of open beta. It also has to be noted that you cannot transfer your savegames from 15 to 16.

Recommended only if you want a better version of 15.

(And has anyone tried to win the league with Leicester after recent events? I know I did. I failed.)",1464439529,1464439529,True,0,0,0.418948143720626831,0,True,False,False

Firstly, the UI changes have been minimal but visually pleasing. I feel like there's more of a variety of tactics that can work in this game than previous versions, and ""tinkering"" feels more effective. The addition of prozone has been a godsend in noticing trends and meticulous statisitcs that are integral to building a squad to challenge in multiple competitions. National team coaching is still rather underwhelming and something that's likely going to be a side project rather than a focus for a save, it just doesn't have enough depth to it. Goalkeepers will always be a hot issue, but I feel that for the most part there aren't any glaring issues (except that GK match ratings are typically cruel). Youth development feels as rewarding as ever, though there is still a massive lottery when it comes to annual youth intakes.

I'm a newbie to Football Manager, FM15 was my first go around.(I'm an American and only recently fell in love with the sport)

I was a bit worried to grab this game, after it's initial release all the reviews were very very bad. I fell in love with 15 very quickly and wanted to get 16 as soon as it came out. But in came all the bad reviews and I was hesitant. 

A few months later I picked it up on a steam sale, And I haven't regretted it one bit. The addition of staff shortlists is very nice. And contrary to many reviews THEY FIXED INJURYS YAY! This was my biggest issue with 15, and they sure fixed it. I've only have 2-3 seasons over my whole time playing that I was plagued with injury. Which is realistic, some times teams have those kinds of season, but never four players injured in a single match/etc.

I can't tell you how it compares to past FM games, but as a newbie to the series I quite enjoy it. It's slightly improved from 15, so if you're on a budget, just buy 15, or wait for it to go on sale.",1462916611,1462916611,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The offside terror is still there.. They still use the wrong basis for the rule. SI... A player is offside when he is byond the last defender, at the exact moment the pass to him is given. NOT when the ball ends up at his feet. 

SI uses the latter as a point on which to determen weather or not anyone is Offside. Which is absolutely WRONG. Then the game says, ""The whisle had already gone.."" NO it did not.. it just WENT. at the WRONG moment !!!... 

Also.. when a player of my team shoots on goal. and the goalkeeper of the other team parries the ball.. and one of my players has walked or ran up in the mean time... to tap in the rebound... you can only give him offside, at the moment the shot is made from the first player. NOT when the ball comes back from the Goalkeeper.... or the moment the second player taps in the rebound... No player can be offside at that point. Since the ball came back from a player of the oposite team... If you didnt rule him offside at the exact moment of the first shot.. you cant give him offside at any later time. 

SI.. If you want to make a football game.. at least get the rules right.. I have been telling you this for years already.

Sigh... 

Also, saying Holland while you mean The Netherlands... is wrong..  North and south Holland are only 2 provinces of The Netherlands. While The Netherlands is made up out of 12 Provices... so its not Holland.. but The Netherlands... while you look to correct the rules you got wrong..... also get your facts right while you are at it.

The game stil adresses a female manager with HIM or HIS, at several points... i mean, if you after at least 7 years of FM still make these glaring errors, then that says enough about the level of interest the programmers have in making a great game...... and it is no wonder this game is anything but great. it used to be... but no more.

Then, the warping all over the field by the entire team at set plays is still there. its bloody anoying and completely imercive breaking...  its sad.. such competent programmers should be able to avoid these things. 

Injuries are also still a problem... not as much as in previuous installments, but still. Injuring two of your best players, or your best striker ""in training"" which you cant even see,.. two days before an important game is really getting old. SI.. 

STOP this.. it realy puts me off playing..  there is no way you can win any important game that way. 


Now the new feature:

I tried making ""My own"" team... which is a bit of a disapointment tbh. You pick any team in a league...change its name...and the name of the stadium..  then you can add 2 players.. and then change the colors of the shirts of that team.. and the design. Dont know if i missed that first time aroud or if they put it in with release.. but now you can change the design. 

But once done..  Then... you are still only the manager of that team.. and  ""Your team"" takes the place in the league of the team you picked.. that team is gone. So basically nothing really changed.. except for two players, a name and some colours..  That isnt what i thought it would be, or maybe hoped it would be... and creating only 2 players isnt creating a team.. SI. Could you please lean to count ?...  ffs.

And a few games into the season my two created players lost half their attributes.. thats when i stopped playing ""My own team"" Because thats a dealbreaker for me... Its a promising start for a new feature.. but not worth buying the game for... yet.

Then....

I thought that i was rid of the feature that the club owner can sell your players without your knowlegde or consent, without even so much as asking or explaining why.. But that stupid feature made a comeback... i am sad to report.

I AM THE BLOODY MANAGER.... I was hired to MANAGE the team.. I was hired to decide who plays... who gets bought and who gets sold... IF YOU, the owner...  know that better.. then what the hell im I doing here ?...

I bloody hate this feature.. it undermines everything that you work for... you buy a wonderkid.. spend months, if not longer, to coach him to a great payer that wins you games... Along comes bleeming Man U to make a bid on him...  NO WAY. I am NOT selling this player... Then the club idiot/owner says:  ""This offer is to good to be true.. i am authorising the sale...""  ARE YOU BLOODY SERIOUS MAN ?...  NO WAY.. Not while i am around... Oh Yeah.. you can protest.. which i did.. i even told them that if he goes.. i go... 

Now my rep was pretty good... but i can imagine scenario's where that isnt the case. And then what ?.. game ruined... possibly you fired.. or left to find another club.. where this stupid feature could happen all over again. and if thats the case, whats the use of even beginning ?...  ITS A BLOODY DEALBREAKER.. 

As a Manager, i cant even decide anymore which players are sold and which are not... When a bid come in for a player of my team... it used to be that you could set a rule,. like ""Reject all offers..'   or... When he should be sold, and at what price... NOW it says. ""A staffmember will respond.."" Eh ?...  Which staff member ?.. and why him ?.. i am the bloody Manager... I should be deciding that.

What's gotten in your heads SI ?... What made you sit around, and think that this was a good idea ?..... Are you lot insane ?... Bloody hell...

The new ""Create your own team"" Featue is a farce... and the fun of playing is not in that. 

Does SI even read these things ?... if not.. they should... they could learn something.

Sorry SI.. i can not recommend this game at this time... 


And a few big advIces to Sports International;


1- STOP WITH MOST OF THE MANDATORY SHITE THAT MAKES NO SENCE AT ALL.... !!

2- STOP WITH SELLING MY PLAYERS WITHOUT MY APPROVAL.

3- STOP INJURING MY PLAYERS RIGHT BEFORE IMPORTANT GAMES, SO THAT THE OTHER TEAM CAN WIN... 

4- STOP USING THE OFF SIDE FEATURE AS A BALANCING TOOL... WHILE GETTING THE OFFSIDE RULE ABSOLUTELY WRONG.


And maybe,. just maybe.. ill buy the next installment....



Edit: 

Yes.. i still play.. but.. only with a trainer behind it... that alows me to correct the wrongs that are in the game... No trainer... no Football manager... as simple as that.",1446768169,1462706615,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, if you have owned virtually every CM/FM game that has ever been released, then perhaps the following comments will constitute a review which is closer to your heart?

Somewhere along the line, these games lost their soul. The most identifiable yardstick along this path was the moment the developers introduced overall star ratings for players. There was a time, in early CM games, when signing a player was a risk. You would look at their form, stats and overall value and make a decision. Sometimes, you would buy a flop and othertimes you would make a great signing. Now all you need to do is have a good scout and you can go on the star rating they provide. That might be good for your average ADHD fifa manager type players, but people buying these games, for the most part, WANT to spend time trying to make these decisions and don't want to have their hands held through the process. In a real-world scenario, a player who has scored 20+ goals in a season immediately attracts interest from bigger clubs. In this game however, you will simply overlook such a player if their star rating is poor. In these games form has absolutely no relevance when making signings. This is NOT an accurate simulation of how decisions are made in real life.

If you are a long-standing player of these games, ask yourself this question - when was the last time you bought a player who ended up not being good enough to make it at your club? This is something real-world managers live and die by, but is an element of football management which has been woefully overlooked by the developers. Somewhere along the way the developers have made the hardest decision in football management the easiest one. Signing new players should always be a risk. Think of the countless examples in real life of signings which on paper should have been stars. If there is one thing which is clearly evident, it is that even the most experienced and talented of managers occasionally buy players who flop. This should be the most important aspect of any football management simulation. Instead, this game provides you with god-like ability to predict just how good a player will be in the future through an overall star rating. In real-life, managers would make such predictions through a combination of the player's professionalism, age, determination, injury history and availabilility of experienced players for the youngster to learn from. These factors would also fluctuate over time and be subject to change. Hence, a player like Michael Johnson at Man City comes an goes.  By forcing players to consider these things the developers could make this game SO much more rewarding and return the franchise partway to its former roots.

As for the matchday engine, it is simply a non-event. The quality is just not there to warrant ever using this view. The ardent FM fan will not even care about the 3D view as it is not the aspect of the game which they find rewarding. Rather, it is taking the plunge and signing players and working them into a functional tactical system. Incidentally, tactics is the one area of the game which the developers have virtually got spot on. You cannot sail through a season just repeat using the same system like in the good old days.

My suggestion, stop trying make a stats-driven simulation and try to return some atmosphere to the game. You can make a start by providing authentic match day sounds. I could go for hours explaining how this game could be improved, but ultimately this is intended as a review and not a 'blue-sky' suggestion session for the developers.

I will obviously keep buying these games, if only for the reason that there is no other franchise which comes close in this genre. But everytime I buy the latest version a little piece of me (and the genre) dies. It is for this reason that I have to send a message to the world that as long as this game is not fulfilling its enormous potential, I cannot in good conscience recommend it.

The biggest issue in years gone by has been the tactical aspect. So often, someone managed to figure out a be all tactic that was a plug and play win all trophies. But now with FM16, that is definitely not the case. Now, you truly have to adapt your tactics based upon your players skills and attributes.

It seems designed to stop good sides winning too many games by too many goals, so deliberatly will make world class players slam the ball into the post from a tight angle constantly when all he has to do is roll it to the players in the middle. Head the ball inside the 6 yard box? Crossbar or post, guarenteed.

Opposition GK's putting in world class performances, making half a dozen world class saves, on top of all those times you hit the post from 1 yard and he gets a rating of 6.6.

Crosses are totally over powered, get a decent cross in the oppo will score everytime, you do it you will score a heck of a lot, but that's where the world class saves start coming in.

Players go off on international duty? Here, have him back injured for the next 8 weeks!

The only way defenders get good ratings is if they score.

Many frustrating hours, many attemps many restarts this game is not very newbie friendly...

So I decided to pick a 2nd League German team, expectation top half finish... won 3 games then unhappyness started to breed, soon after I got fired...

Did this with a couple of restarts, one time I forgot to include one player in the midseason training camp, the end.

So I finaly managed to surive a season, barely avoided relegation though, made a couple of additions to the squad, started getting rediculessly good bids for my players, job offers and so on, the game was fun, I was doing good, sold the wrong guy... Unhappyness... fired...

This game is extremly unforgiving, one wrong click and your out... wanted to praise a player for his conduct, by accident hit praise game, desaster... Usualy the results aren't completly without merrit but to seem a bit harsh...
The game engine is however a bit funky same players making the right clicks I finished 2nd in the Cup (!) and made the promotion playoffs... and won(!)

In my opinion that is a bit too much range in the power of morale and happyness having done the scenario twice with the same set of plays once losing every game untill I got fired the other time winning allmost everything and beating the crap out of champions league teams...

In order to try to fix unhappyness I once tried to arange a friendly against a very small reputation team... 39-2 shots, 17-1 on target 0-1 the result..

The game is challenging, and as long as you pay attention to what you do its fun, but the happyness morale factor weighs too heavy in both directions...

now to chose one of these thumbs thingies...

Yes I recommend the game, it may be tough, but not completly random and unreasonable. When you have time and patience to work your way through its very deep and rewarding and gives you lots of stuff to do.

No I do not recommend the game to newbies, except if you have a lot of nerve and are willing to restart several times because the game is so very punishing. And also spend some time reading guides... you're lost without.",1460374110,1460374110,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,1,True,False,False

The biggest question I'm am going to answer first is what is the main difference between 2015 and 2016 for all the hardcore football fans. For me the biggest difference is that know it now shows you which attributes are important for which coaching abilites. I'm sure a lot of you had to google them and probably save a copy on your desktop to look at from time to time, I know I did. The biggest issue I have had with this game until now was finding good staff members which usually takes me an hour or two at the start of every game. Now with this small added feature it takes me at most 30 minutes which I don't mind at all.

Now with that out of the way, for newcomers this game is addicting as hell. If you are into football and management style then this is an incredible game. Manage your favourite team and take them to new heights. That's the mentallity I have whenever I play this game. Be prepared though, it's not easy. It is realistic enough to excite you as well as fustrate you. You DON'T get to play the matches. Don't compare this to FIFA or PES. This is purely a management game so the graphics aren't exactly top priority. There are so many different indepth options that you will spend ages learning them. Again I recommend this for football fans. If you are not into football then this game could get boring very fast. You have to micro-manage every single player and staff member if you want to have the best team in the world. I am currently in my 3rd season with Roma. The first two season went well with 2nd place finishes in Seria A and a Domestic Trophy. This season everything is going to shit and I don't know why but I can't stop playing. I feel like Jose Mourinho. If you don't know who he is then don't buy this game.

I couldn't get into FM15 despite it apparently fixing some of the major bugbears of games gone before and I hung back on this one until the ""Winter Update"".

What an unholy mess. I'd say what a mess the engine is, criticise the inury system, those game breaker things that happen with every supposed update we get. You know, the things that people cricise Activision for regarding CoD or EA over BF etc. Nah, this one, I couldn't play the game. You know that moment when you get an email in the real world?

Played is more than just over egging something that was made up of rebooting and attempting to clear a shed load of temp files the crash dump decided to create.

You know that time when you created a whole new batch of swear words when you couldn't beat your mate on Goldeneye? This abomination needs me to revisit those times.

Since i started playing this version i felt like i knew nothing of the game, even with that much experience on my side. I read a LOT of articles, tips, manuals online, thinking i was out of shape, trying to ""recycle"" myself, but i got NOWHERE! It's frustrating!

EVERY SINGLE FUCKING MATCH i concede 1-2 goals from crossing/corners no matter what!

The fucking opposition makes 2 shots and score at least 1 time ALMOST EVERY GAME! And does not matter the quality of this opposition! It can be Real Madrid or TIGRES DO BRASIL! And the same does not apply to you! Your team can have 30 shots, half on the target, 3 OR 4 on the woodwork (ridiculous, plain and simple) and score 0 to 1 time! Again, ALMOST EVERY GAME!

UPD: Just finished second season, got some statistics (Vanarama National) with good old pen and paper. 84% of goals (matches played by my team, both sides) was scored from crosses, most of them from right flank/from sideline, most (like 3/4) one-touch crosses were aimed to far post/top corner with great precision, 8 goals were scored from ~40m (spot near sideline) exactly to far top corner (Vanarama National, again).
I played every FM since 2005, and can say it's the worst match engine ever. Yes, it worse than ""top class player misses 9 of 10 one-on-ones"", worse than ""4-5 woodworks every match"", worse than ""pandemy of injuries"" etc. It's just BORING as hell, like two kids playing FIFA: cross -> goal, repeat.

And, just like every year, I start playing and again realise they have failed to address the one major flaw in the game; that f***in' match engine!!

The flow of the game is random, the players don't follow instructions, and the movement and actions of the players are completely unnatural. The old 'kick the ball at a team-mate which ricochets 30 yards to an opposition striker' still remains, as does the static defending. The forwards still constantly make the wrong decisions in key areas, ignoring team-mates who have an open goal to try and score from ridiculous angles. I hear defenders of the game argue its a strategy game, and not designed to have life-like matches taking place and I agree. But if the players actions dont reflect the instructions, then having the function is pointless. They might as well remove it. I'd rather have stick men who's actions and decisions are life-like, than superb 3D graphics of something that is frankly, embarrasing to watch.

It isnt unplayable, but the other major disappointment is the lack of new features. It is hardly any different from FM 2015. As such, I wouldn't recommend anyone buys the game and had I played a demo, I'd have saved £35 and just looked for an update patch for FM 2015.

Still early days and it may yet surprise me, but all I see is an extension of the extremely tedious media side of the game, which is just as repetitive as it was in FM 2015 and the available responses too black or white.

This game is like a crack addiction - feels great sometimes but is ultimately bad for you, and may even give you a hernia (does crack do that? idk - not an expert).

The match engine is not great. Your team just doesn't listen to you. I mean, they listen a bit, but not much. Professional footballers are supposed to treat their managers as god, not as the crazy crack addict on the sidelines shouting ineligible commands, which they ignore as they would a demented grandmother.

I might just be paranoid, but the match results seem fixed. It seems as though every time you REALLY need points, you just lose. Simple as that. I've tested it and save-loaded the same game in which I am clear favourites to win, at a crucial point in the season, and 9 times out of 10 i would lose it. I dont just mean lose the game - i also mean lose my fucking mind.

-beat chelsea, liverpool and man city early on in the season.
-lose against watford, huddersfield and peterborough in the important games later.

I don't think the developers are upgrading the match engine. They are developing multiple game simultaneously, and 1 year is barely enough time to upgrade database, improve graphics and UI, and make a few adjustments; that's the extent of what they seem to do each year. SI usually spends 3 months patching the game so the development window is probably even shorter than a year.

In other words, you are being horribly ripped off every time you pay for their 'new' product which is more like a patch developed for some months with new graphics and animations. I bet they are using the same engine they've been using for a decade because many core problems never go away in FM series. As a rule of thumbs, you should never buy products released every year.

Returning problems that plague FM every single year are still here because devs refuse to spend time to improve the game.

I took a team predicted to finish at 24th in English 6th football division. In 4 years, I won 4 leagues, promoted the team 4 times, won 8 cups, and the team's wealth was increased 50 folds. Meanwhile, my weekly wage increased from 1000 euro to 1200 euro because the board constantly tries to knock down your wage after each successful season. When I took that team to the premier league my status in the club was 'favourite'; not a legend, not even an icon.

I had two player with the exact same abilities and potential abilities. One had 1 ambition, the other had 20 ambition. The latter doesn't have an agent and the former always requests 3 times more wages and complain about not playing in a bigger club.

Interviews and commentaries are SAME word to word with FM 2006. You are forced to answer mind numbingly boring questions over and over for the same response and news.

Cross is ridiculously OP as it was in earlier versions of 2015. Match stats are wildly different from real soccer. (top players in real soccer marks 90~95% pass success rate. In FM it's 80% at best. Neuer's save rate was 91% in 2015 season. In game it's less than 60%. etc). Goalkeeper AI is horrendous. They often pick up an imaginary ball while the attacker dribbles past him.

To be honest, FM isn't a bad game. It's probably the best sports simulation game available on the market. That doesn't excuse them from cash-milking gamers with the same product every year. If you are a new player interested, sure, go ahead and buy the game. Otherwise, stick to FM you have because new versions don't offer anything new or better. New FM game is microscopically better than its previous installment.

There are a lot more problems but I will just end with this note: FM series has NOT been evolving for almost half a decade. Don't give these people your money.

First of all, the game crashes every single time I play a match for the first time. At some point of the match, the game simply close. Maybe it is related to the version for mac, but I don't have this problem with any other application or game.
The game itself in the management part seems pretty realistic and they added a bounch of good stuff, but the matches are totally buggy and unbalanced. Just to mention the major issues:
1) I get on average 4-5 yellow cards and a red card every match, regardless the instruction that I give to the team for tackling.
2) Unnatural movements of defenders (run away from the opponent with the ball, run in random diractions) lead to totally unrealistic plays. This was actually present in previous editions, and it strikes me they didn't manage to fix it after so many years.
3) When the ball hits a player bounches of several tents of meters in a totally unnatural way.
4) Seems like the ball posession is totally unrelated to the quality of midfielders and their quantity, but is strongly linked to the tatic.. If your opponent plays with the 4 line, he's likely to have the possession, no matter if you have iniesta and xavi in the middle.
5) Also seems, but I may be biased in this, that is far more easy for the opponent to score many goals when he plays better, that for you when you have the edge.
In 10-15 games I either won for 1 goal more or lost by 3-4.
Sure there are some improvements, like more realistic tackling, but these issues make the game really frustrating to play.
Thes issues have nothing to do with ability or tactic, they seem to be totally arbitrary.
Don't buy this game, it's an expensive and frustrating waste of your time.

Well, I recommend that you ALWAYS START UNEMPLOYED. Because to be honest its to easy to start with Real Madrid, Arsenal or any big club with lots of money and already big name players. But seriously where is the fun in that??? Plus you will play 3 or 4 seasons then proberly get the sack because you will have one bad season and not meeting the boards expectations. Then you will quit and start a new game. Pointless in my view.

STARTING UNEMPLOYED is the way. Yes you will end up getting a rubblish club with no money, crap players and more than likely limited staff. 

I started off with Lowestoft, no money, no scouts and crap players, but I had fun trying sign some decent players that i couldnt scout. And I did, though I started unemployed, I never got a job till mid October so the season was well on its way and Lowestoft were rock bottom in the Vanarama North. I signed a couple of good players and still I struggled to get them out the religation zone. In fact I got the sack with 6 games to go (a bit harsh I thought as I was only 2 points from safety) but hey ho, thats football management for you.

Anyway back unemployed searching and applying for jobs I managed to get a job with Chester right at the end of the season and they had been religated already to the Vanarama North.

So that was my first season, not great but i found it a joy to play. Fantastic!!

Being that Chester were religated my bonus was that I had some decent players already. Tom Peers and John Rooney are proberly the best in the team. And I had a much better season as I did win the league and I never sold any players and only bought in 2 players. I'm now in my second season with Chester (my third incl Lowestoft) and had released and sold a few players and got a few more decent ones in and still loving it and doing well. 

So starting unemployed is so much harder, so much more interesting than starting with the big clubs. 

If start at the top - the only way is down.
If you start at the bottom - the only way is up.

Unless you are willing to spend hours and hours reading forums about tactics then don't bother.

I started out playing small clubs,  really small ones, so i expected to lose a lot of matches.

but once i got into it a decided to try playing as bigger teams,  I tried celtic,  man utd,  chelsea.  I got sacked from every one of those clubs because we lost every single match,  even if your players are fluid in their tactics, are all star players, are perfect in their positions and have superb morale, brazil will lose to some country that only learned about football a hour ago.

speaking of morale, when holding team meetings, doing team talks, or doing anything in the best interests of your team, will either piss everyone off,  or if you are really lucky, only piss half of your team off.

someone isnt playing well? individual talk to tell them you have faith in them! but wait! EVERYONE else is pissed off coz you didnt say you had faith in them...

tell everyone you have faith in them?  wait... now EVERYONE is nervous and stressed coz your putting pressure on them! 

I love managment games, and when I first played I really did like this game, but like I said, this game is 90% reading about tactics and 10% swearing at your defence team for standing with the ball at their feet until the other team walk up and take it off you... then your awesome defence will run backwards AWAY from the ball as if it was some voodoo spell that made the ball disappear... then proceed to watch as the other team scores goal after goal

they tried to make the game more realistic by making it difficult,  but the realism is a big team like ManUtd  should be able to beat little unknown teams with a major hangover and their eyes closed,  yet in this game,  even when your team are on full form, they will lose 5-0

Roll ball to defenders = kick ball into area where none of your teammates are present
Shoot on sight = shoot from 90 degree angles
Cross more Often = Pass Backwards
Look for overlap = Pass ball between full back and winger

The list is endless. Every year Si make the game less and less enjoyable and more and more scripted.
Dull

Example: Playing Tottenham away. Conceded four due to RB consistently coming inside to press the CM. RB instructions? Press Much Less/Stay Wider. Can anyone explain WHY player instructions do not work?

It takes Si about 6-7 months to patch the game to make it actually responsive. By that time they are almost ready to release the ""new"" season update. I Will not be buying another Football Manager.",1454783113,1454929174,False,15,2,0.607781529426574707,2,True,False,False

Reading many online forums and the constant glaring submissions from people like myself -

- 26 shots, 14 on goal..... opposition 6 shots, 2 on goal - they win 0 - 1
- Injuries ........... over and over again
- Constantly passing to the opposition, worldclass players turning over the ball like park footballers
- Defeneders watching opposition players stroll by without challenging them
- Work the ball in or near the box only to have 3 - 4 oppostion players pack a scrum on my player making impossible to shoot
- Players wont follow game tactics at all, wont pass, wont run into space, wont defend

Its a real shame to watch this franchise unravel like this, 1000's of game owners make the same complaints and yet they still release the game with all these concerns for last few years. 
The list goes on and on but I am just over this garbage, take the game back 4 years where players followed instructions and the games were at least a fair contest.
I just played another season of Man Utd (re started 4 games now), bought players to strengthen an average team. Just got lapped 2 - 7 by Newcastle, played BATE in mid week europe game and had 21 shots, 12 on target while BATE had 5 shots with 1 on target ................ you guessed it, i get rolled 0 - 1 at Old Trafford.
F***ing Joke.

FM16 nonsense in no particular order:

A player will do everything he can to force a move (except actually put in a transfer request - to keep his loyalty bonus). Then when you finally give in and sell him, his team mates will be annoyed at YOU for seling him. Ridiculous.

A young player, at the end of a meeting, will almost always say ""I'll get going then. I'm sure you'll want me for something else soon...""
Excuse ME? I'm a strict disciplinarian with a fierce reputation (think Fabio Capello). No young player in his right mind would DARE be so damned rude like that in real life.

Endless, pointless, media. PLEASE there is absolutely no need for all the daft questions over and over again. All that time spent programming them could've been spent better elsewhere for God's sake.

You take over a new club and are instantly bombarded with meetings with players disgruntled at their lack of football under the PREVIOUS manager. They'll even make threats like ""if the situation doesn't improve we'll be talking about this again..."" and there's nothing you can do about it. There's no such thing as a clean slate in FM. Why do all players, regardles of their personality, THREATEN us constantly?

Also when taking over a new club (at the end of the season/beginning of the next) you are forced to hold a team meeting where all you can do is annoy half the squad. The best you can say is ""this season coming is going to be a good one for the club"" (or words to that effect), which leads to a near-unanimous response of ""what a waste of time...""

Absolutely non-negotiable contract terms are infuriating. 
Every. Single. Part. Of. A. Contract. should be negotiable. You're supposed to be sitting at a table with a player and his agent. You can't tell me that when you bring up a release clause they both stick their fingers in their ears? Money talks. You should be able to negotiate ALL parts of a contract no matter how much the other side wants to ""stick"".

Place an advert for a coach. You are allowed another 5 coaches. Sign the first coach. Advert is automatically removed and so you have to place another advert. WHY? Stop this shit. Let me decide when the advert ends ffs.

Staff respond to said advert. You ""approach to sign"" and find they are not willing to negotiate a contract. 
WHY DID THEY APPLY THEN??? Bloody idiots.

Why are team talk choices changed for each match? Each half? Each post-match? Feels a bit iffy.
Surely I should be able to say whatever I want at all times, rather than select from a handful of pre-determined choices?

Assistant manager's in-match advice is complete and utter useless drivel. He's just picking out stuff at random and saying it. You are playing a short passing game; he tells you to play long-ball. You play long-ball, he tells you to adopt a short passing game (apply this to every other kind of tactical decision - he will simply tell you to do the opposite). Pleb.

Some players will refuse to move to your club citing that they don't think they ""will get the 1st team football they need"" at your club. You can't even open negotiations. You can't even guarantee them key player status.
They then move to another club on half the wages you would've given them, and rot away in the reserves. LOL.

Why does the game make a big deal out of the tone of voice I use in press conferences? What purpose does that serve, exactly? ""Is often calm but has been known to be assertive on occasion..."" What on EARTH is the point in this?

I could go on forever but you get the idea. If you suffer from insomnia, I definitely recommend this game to you. It is so boring you might just slip into a coma. 1/10",1452904463,1454671031,False,333,192,0.720928609371185303,24,True,False,False

I've (proudly? not so proudly...?) logged hundreds of hours on FM games over the years.

They have their hit or miss moments every year. The match engine is never perfect, or takes several patches to get to an enjoyable state. Year after year, features are lack luster, or it feels like the devs are holding back good ideas for future years. After buying FM year after year, I decided to hold off on new FM's until there was some real ground breaking stuff, and milk FM 2014 for every penny I could. I played the 2015 demo, and deemed it unworthy. I played the 2016 demo at first, and also found it lacking.

But after reading forums and posts by respected FM community members, I got the sense that 2016 was in a really good place as of the last patch. Many reviews i've read said that FM 16 was the most enjoyable the franchise has been in recent years... so when it finally went on sale 25% off, I decided to bite. 

And I've never enjoyed FM as much as I have in the last 30+ hours of playing. The 16.2 match engine feels great... the graphics are respectable... and the UI (after downloading my favorite FLUT skin) is beautiful. I definitely think skipping 2015 was the right move, because 2016 feels packed with features that 2014 didn't have. Like it's almost a completely different game.

If you're a veteran of FM games, and are on the fence about buying 2016. I say do it, especially if it's on sale...

If you're new to the franchise, this is probably one of the most accessible versions of the game to get in to. To get the full FM experience, I would strongly reccomend doing some research on graphics add-ons (like facepacks, logos, UI improvements, kits (jerserys), and other 3D enhancements) from fan/3rd party sites. After spending the day updating all of my graphics and images... FM 2016 is far and away my favorite iteration of the game.


tl;dr:

Buy 2016 (on sale), skip 2017 (unless it's revolutionary). Make sure to heavily customize the graphics. Profit.",1452063597,1452063597,True,3,0,0.531271696090698242,0,True,False,False

Generally, I would say this is a significant improvement on FM 2015 (worth asking price? maybe, probably more so than previous incarnations.).  Improvements are mainly to UI and match/performance analysis.  

In my experience the match engine has some hiccups (way too many scores from crosses) but I have noticed a significant improvement since launch. 

To respond to negative reviews (mostly about match engine):

Will you sometimes get a match where you get 10:1 shots and lose? Yes. Will you get an unlucky season (i.e. too many key injuries) and get sacked? Sometimes. I won't say it's all perfect, but I enjoy some randomness.

I have not experienced consistent injustices in the match engine, but for those who are complaining about it: I hope you tried all sorts of different tactical adjustments and considered things like player consistency/chemistry/tactical fluidity before coming here to review the game.",1451866951,1451866951,True,10,1,0.591970503330230713,0,True,False,False

Every cross is an auto goal. 4 Defenders between the goal and the forward receive a cross or 0, a goalk keeper that 'Rushes out' and one that prefers to say in. A deep sitting team or one pushing forward. A cross will find the forward like a magnet. Whether the winger is crossing it from the middle of the field or by the corner flag. You can watch 5 defenders and a goalie all stupidly stare at a cross while a mediocre forward from a lower league connects with the perfect fit. 

But maybe you say I am just a bad FM. And that is possible -- except you can look at the statistics of every other team. 80% of goals are crosses. In fact thats what most matches are between two evenly matched teams, its cross and counter cross. 

The other banalities of the game are just quirks of FM -- a sliding tackle strips your player but the ball falls to another one of your player who gives it back to the sliding player -- but the crosses simply take you out of the game. Presumably some programmer watched a game once and saw a cool cross from the deep land perfectly on the tip of a strikers foot and decided that this is the only way goals can be scored.

Oh and also there is a pretty nasty memory leak. But thats usual for FM engines so if you soldiered on through to 2016 its no surprise.",1451798704,1451866304,False,33,4,0.611365675926208496,0,True,False,False

In my first test game to experiment with how things have changed since 2013 (when I last purchased a FM), it was clear that results are pre-determined based on variables which it appears are impossible to influence on match day. 

As an example, I re-played a single game five times, with three different formations (4-4-2, 4-1-3-2, 5-3-2), and slight tweaks to the two formations that seemed to work the best. 

In all five instances, the game was a 2-2 draw, with exactly the same players scoring, within a five minute range. 

In other words, no matter what I did in terms of team selection, role selection, formation selection, tactic selection and temperament selection, the game played out in precisely the same manner. 

Other games I have re-played in the range of 3-4 times, with exactly the same results as the first play through, and the same scorers (for the opposing team), but at slightly different times. 

Personally, I get the feeling that the creators of this game have lost their drive to create a simulation in favour of an easier code which can develop results based on far fewer variables which cannot be changed on match day by the player, most probably to reduce the load on the CPU, but probably to also reduce the amount of work they have to put in.

But it's also pretty much exactly the same as what we got last year.  And the year before that.  The new additions are that you now have an avatar on the sidelines who just kinda stands there and gestures at your players, and you get to actually do an interview with a club after you apply for a job there.  Neither of these things really makes much of a difference in the game, to be totally clear.

Oh, you can give them a list of changes you want made to backroom staff before you come in to start at a club.  That's a thing too, and I do kind of like it.  At the same time though, it really just debatably streamlines the way things were done in FM15 and FM 14 and FM13 and so on so on and so forth.

Firstly, I've gotten promoted twice in a row and qualified for champions league in years 3 - I'm going OK! I have played it for years and years, this review is not on the back of me doing badly in the game.

Basics* 
*(note - a lot about match engine, but this is a large part of what makes the game enjoyable for me)

The main issue I encountered was the quality of the match engine. Prior to the release, we heard about how the developers were improving this area of the game. However;
-Goalkeepers are making STUPID decisions, the visual standard you watch would have been disappointing in a game that's 10 years old. It hasn't a patch on the FIFA Manager game I played 10 years ago.
-Defenders are nearly as bad - they can't track a run, they give away stupid penaltys and can never cover the back post
-Tactics enforced can't really be seen in play. If you target a side in your tactics, the stat's never display this, the highlights never show it.
-Match engine overall has not improved. The lack of progress since FM15 is absolutely TERRIBLE
-Negotations are still unrealistic - small clubs will still demand 30 million for a hot prospect who has never played a game for a club.
-It still hasn't allowed for better negotiations on contracts etc. - I would have liked more career development talks etc. when taking on and dealing with young players.
-The press conferences are just irritating - again, very little progression from last year. Even most of the questions are the same.
-The 'new club' feature just isn't good. Picking a new team has been made far too irritating and long winded by the way you have to search. It's as if the developers got bored at this part and just gave up before they were finished. I was really excited about this feature, but it has a number of HUGE flaws too such as you're able to get players who haven't got work permits, then if they can't be renewed at the end of the season - they're gone (I lost half of my team after the first season on free transfers because of it).

Overall, I would advise getting FM15 for a fraction of the price and getting an update for the new players etc. This is one of the worst updates I've played and it's really not worth the effort that has been put in since the release of FM15. I really don't think they're keeping with the times, there are lots of new features that they could of added but haven't.

Before I list my complaints, I would like to emphasize that I have no problems with winning games, competions or creating working tactics and that these complaints are merely observations which cause a huge amount of frustration.

- Goalkeeper intelligence is laughable as they will frequently concede goals easily in their close corner due to terrible placement and movement. And even with frequent clean sheets, your goalkeepers (or anyone else) rating will rarely reach an average above 7.0.

-Defenders (particularly centrebacks) will track a player's run only to make 180 turn and run away from the attacker, which usually results in an easy conceded goal. And it doesn't matter whether you play as Bayern or Gateshead, because you will concede more than a fair share of goals from crosses at the far post, due the defender(s) inability/will to follow the run made by the attacking player.

- You will never/rarely actually get a goal, when you need one. Whether it's drawing level or winning a close encounter. And to pile on the misery, the opposition will also more than often score in the dying minutes, snatching either a draw or win.

- The aforementioned point makes the matches feel extremely predictable as you either absolutely smash opposition, go ninety minutes without a single chance or get the dreaded late conceded goal and all is visible/predictable due to the way your/opposing players move about on the pitch during the whole match/last minutes.

- Different tactical approach isn't as visible on-screen as one might imagine, which gives little incentive to create/tweak own tactics.

- Corner instructions are ignored (short corner instruction results in floating crosses being hit).

I think it is time SI started treating each new iteration as DLC rather than a new title, I do recommend this version, but hesitantly. 

That out of the way, is it a good update? Yes. (and no?)

Bad thing first: The new create your own club function is silly and needs TONS of work, you'd think that if they introduce this sort of functionality they'd make sure it was user friendly even as part of DLC. It isn't, all it is is a means to do an editor botch job on an existing club, take their place in the league, change the name, place and colours to your heart's content and finally get really frustrated trying to work out which players you want to add to the club whilst not having anything other than a player-name filter. So that striker you remember plays for Scunthorpe but you don't know his name? Don't imagine you can find him, you can't. 

Good things: The U/I has been cleaned up successfully, not just interface wise but also interaction wise, you don't have to do silly repetitive interviews each game any more for example. The game looks clean and fresh, even the 3D engine is now sort of worth using. Another good thing is that the opposing managers/teams now respond to your tactical foibles better, when I added a striker after going 1-0 down the opposing manager didn't wait and switched to a counter-attacking formation straight away, when we equalised anyway he dropped further back but put on a lighting fast striker instead of his targetman. I have never experienced that before in FM20** it used to be more like playing against a scripted bot. 

Best thing: The match-engine has had significant work to make it more realistic. I am only a season in so far, but I am very impressed with not just the impact my decisions have on the flow of the game, but also the fact that players seem more creative in their interpretation of my instructions, adapting to the flow of the game if they are more experienced, flapping around the field aimlessly after a mistake if they are youngsters and compounding the problems. Compared to 2015 the tactical side of the game has improved beyond cosmetics, which is what the game should be all about.

My first version of FM was actually last years FM 2015. I was rather uneasy about spending another $55 less than a year later... But I am not disapointed. It very much feels like a better game. Easily the best sports management game out there, and by far the best football manager.

+ Better interface - there is a multitude of changes to the menus, graphics and overall interface. It's more fluent, easier to understand and quicker to navigate. Very smartly done.
+ Better engine. Hard to explain, other than games seem to play out more logical, or at least closer to what you'd expect. It's not perfect though, others have reported weird outcomes.

+- 3D matches are stupendously amazing compared to basically all other sports management games. I'm neutral on it though, because the graphics is not amazing. Needs work.

- there is new player animations, but they're still jerky; timing is still off on things (ie. referee still talking to player when he's actually gone and the match is getting ready to continue?)

From a gameplay point of view, apart from a few goalkeeping mistakes which have been quite frustrating to deal with, the game continues to allow you to create your own identity, to find a system within the players you have which can lead you to success. If you want to play a Sam Allaydyce route one system, Barcelona Tiki-Taka or the Pochettino press, all is avaible to you and takes times and tinkering to find the right plan for you.

Bought Ashley Cole 34 years old for 300k 59k p/w salary) Won the treble first season. Then sold everyone again and bought all new line up of wonderkids. Average team age was 20 tears old. Won the Quintuple second season. (community shield, cap cup, FA cup, Prem League, and champs league) onto my third season. All debts paid off, stadium being expanded and all my wonderkids want to play for sunderland. Been offered jobs at Man City Arsenal and Tottenham. 

The game is great although the injuries seem to be random with regards to which player gets injured but the dates at which these injuries occur seem to be set. 
I'd like to be able to see the stadium & expansion.
I'd also like alot more room in training to be able to choose how i want to train the players. More depth.
Same with formations. When you have a fairly awesome team you may want to set them up like the Barcelona team of 2012 4-1-1-1-3-1 with a stagured midfield. Exact positioning of your team would be great instead of static choices.
Updates on players that are loaned out such as improvement and appearances. I'm sure this is already available but i cant seem to find it lol
I think the game as a whole is great, obviously the graphics with 3D match cam could be improved haha it looks like Pro evo 3 or worse haha
Just more depth to be honest, maybe add a training day in where you can set up sprints and actually put the cones down yourself and tell players what to do for training and then you see how much your players have improved at the end of the training seassion. This would make seasons last long and also it would add an element into the game which makes you believe you're actually in control of the teams development. Like the old boxing games where you were in the gym and the better you mashed the combos the more improvement you saw. Obviously not everyones cup of tea so should make it optional. :P

Hmmm not much else to say apart from the size of the player database you use drastically changes the speed of the game so go for the Large database around 40,000 out of a possible 250,000 players, it runs smoothly and you still get alot of the wonderkids featured on google and other peoples blogs online.

One fellow on here said the game defines what a certain role will do and your pixel guy will do what the game says over detemined by the developers.

First of all, the Game makes Fun, it is better than the years before and keeps evolving, everything gets bigger and deeper.

Yes, you can loose Games even you have 70%+ Possesion, couse Teams play Counter´s effectiv - Adapt to it, you can build around it or play counter yourself. (Leicester in the EPL for example have less Possesion than all other Teams)

Yes, the Manager and Regens look absolut ridiculous - who cares,i love it.

The Match Engine is strange? I think it is the best Engine EVER in any Game. Every Player, Trainer is so different and every aspect can win or loose you the game.

Injuries? First, in the Beta it was really hard, but now its realistic (Watch Arsenal, Chelsea, Bayern...) Every Team can have a injury problem.

Positives: 
The players move a lot more realistically on the pitch this year. It's a small detail but I think it helps the enjoyment of the match engine.
I would say budgets for teams are fairly realistic so you can run the club making the signings you would expect the team to make in real life, and the odd coup to make everyone happy.
Other teams interest in your transfer listed players is much better this year. Now it is easier to get other teams interested  in buying them although it still isn't a certainty they will be interested. But last year you couldn't shift nobody.
Teams pay a more realistic price for your big name players ie: Man Utd will pay £50 million for Harry Kane rather than £500k and expect it to be accepted.
I feel players respond to your instructions better during the match than last year. 

Negatives
Finding tactics that work for top teams on the game is proving to be like a military opertation for me, good luck!
The match engine at times is very scripted making you lose and go on bad runs. ie: you lose matches with shot ratios of 30:1 and possession stats 70%:30% and at times this can just go on and on and on.
When your players are having a bad day, they are having a BAD DAY their attempts to look anything like a legitimate football team are laughable
The same teams always buy the top players (Man Utd).
There is some kind of bug where if you sign a player who you intend to use as a back up on a free transfer the fans become outraged saying it was a ridiculous waste of money when, their free???

Ok, so after more game play time, (about another 2 weeks) it is clear that there is no tactic which the game allows you to use successfully with top teams or lower league teams and I honestly I have exhausted every one, including several wierd tactics through desperation which did nothing. It's not that your team isn't competitive in the match, they 100% are but despite this the game always scripts you to lose. And this isn't me in an upset spat my dummy out tantrum, its very true. I think this is backed up by the lack of successful tactics being posted on forums, there just aren't any. It's a shame that two thirds of the game becomes unplayable because of this. The championship is the only league I have found where a good tactic is actually accepted by the game and it allows you moderate success but it's a huge shame to be so restricted. Ive found I can keep in the top 3 of the Chinese super league with Guangzhou Evergrande. WOW. Some may understand how terrible that is considering their resources and the competition. But Ive tested teams like PSG Barcelona and Tottenham to name examples, and couldn't even defeat amateur teams and therefore as you can imagine I couldnt beat better teams. I was having some success with Watford, until game suddenly decided that without a drop in player performance my tactic would now send me on a twenty match losing streak and therefore the sack. I still had the same shot, possession and corner stats as I did when I was winning by the way. So when the game starts scripting, you just can't fight it.",1448643189,1449342792,False,4,0,0.509127795696258545,0,True,False,False

As a fan of the series, and a loyal buyer; I am mesmerised at the utter redundancy of the inefficiency of the tactics you play or the individual intructions you give to a player. Now, for example, Ignazio Abate will be charging down the right wing. He will beat his man, get to the byline and you will be watching on thinking, ""Great! Cut it back for a tap in!!"" However, Ignazio will not cut it back as instructed individually by telling him ""shoot less often"", ""cross more often"" and ""cross from byline"". After this has happened throughout an entire season, and after you have seen other players do similar, if not identical, actions then you begin to wonder: what is the point?

And that is exactly where I am at presently. What is the point? Your decisions cannot effect the game accurately.

Another FM for all of us to dump endless hour into only to come back and rage about the injurys and how tactically you dropped the ball. But why? Why so many injurys? Why did my ""perfect"" tactic fail to work? Why why why?
Honestly this seems like the first questions I always seem to ask myself playing the FM games, maybe in the first 10-20 hours. But once you drop that worlds smallest violin and stop feeling sorry for yourself and realize you wont be getting that perfect 100% record, you wont be getting a transfer coup on that awesome wonderkid, you wont always move to the next league every season. You wont do alot of stuff you want to in the first couple cycles of this game, and why should you? You are a bloody soccer coach, you are going to win and loose, get fired from the dream job just to pick up some crap job earing 35k a month vs the 5 million you gladly pocketed last season. 

Now the reason I recommend this game is because its not easy. This game wont really put you into the winning position from the get go. That to me is the whole game, like working through every single injury, working through player deals trying to not go broke, feeling the woes of a actual soccer coach is what this is all about. Try looking at one of the more streamlined soccer managers if you want something easier with less injuries, less players, and less realism. Or you could always jump back a few genrations of the game and get a feel for it with the older games.

My advice to anyone new to this game would be get a couple seasons under your belt with a decent team and focus on training out that tactical knowlege, and really get a feel for this game before commiting to a low tier team.

Secondly, upon reading many of the reviews here (mostly the negative ones), I have to say - a game being ""too hard"" isn't a valid reason to give a negative review; it just means you either don't understand the game, or you're just plain bad at it.

Alright, onto the review. As I've said, I've played this franchise for quite a while now, with thousands of hours pumped into it, and I must say that this is probably the most balanced of them all. I say that for a couple of reasons. First, I don't run away with games against teams I have no business beating. It sounds like a lot of people on here will take a team like Aston Villa and expect to be world beaters, lose to Man Utd, and say ""the game's cheating, I lost."" Look at the real life table and you'll see something shocking! Villa are dead last. You're not meant to win every game all the time. I'm sorry, but you're not - if you did, the game would be broken. 

I find it funny that people come into sim games and expected it to be realistic, but only if you're winning, like you're the best manager in the world. If a real life, qualified, and experienced manager can't get wins, or stay afloat in the top flight, what kind of gall do you have to think you're better than somebody who does it for a living? It's a bit arrogant.

Yes, I understand it's a video game, and that you, as the player, have a hero complex. You've played Mario, you're a fat Italian plumber who's doing acrobatics and crap, killing monsters. Then you play FM and bring that mentality to a sim game, and get pissy when you're garbage. Well, Mario isn't a realistic game is it? We all know Italians can't do anything, let alone save a princess over and over again. ;)

Jokes aside, the positives of this game vastly outweigh the negatives. Another positive to the match engine is the realism in the highlights and game play. In the past I've noticed that in the final 10 minutes or so, teams would dominate you. This was incredibly present in FM15. It didn't seem to matter who the teams were - Spain vs. Malta, didn't matter, Malta would destroy the final ten with nearly 100% possession. Sure, it could be written off as tactics, and player fatigue, and all that, but it was too consistent to be a fluke. This version has none of that. Evenly matched teams seems to have equal spells of possession through the game, which is good. 

There are still some issues with possession mind you. I have found that in the majority of my matches, even against superior teams, I'm dominating the possession and shot game. In fact, it can be a bit ridiculous at times with me having upwards of 75% control over the game. I suppose it's a good problem to have.

Let's take a look at scorelines. Again, in past installments, scores could reach outrageous numbers on a consistent basis. I can't tell you how many times I was apart of 5-3 games. Sure, it happens. But not 15-20 times a season. FM 16 provides more realistic scores, despite the odd possession bias. Most of my games are 1-0, 2-1, etc... I had one 4-0 game. There really isn't much more to say on this other than it seems like it's more realistic.

Defending - oh boy, this has been a personal problem of mine for years in this game. I just don't have the tactical know-how to keep the ball out of my own net, and I like many, ticked it up to a poor ME. This year's version I'm quite pleased with. Either I figured out the defending myself, or the game changed to allow more realistic scorelines. I don't mind losing - it's part of football. But I HATE losing 5-0. It was a turn off for me, and often times I would just quit and not play for a few days because of that. Like I said, save for one game where we scored 4, I haven't seen obnoxious scorelines for seemingly no reason. It's good, I like it.

""But, we've dominated the game, have 30 shots, and lost 1-0. The game is broken."" - Many negative reviews. I suppose these people have never heard of defending/counter attacking. Absolutely that can happen. Look at Chelsea's Champions League win a few years back. They sat in their own end the entire game, and scraped out a win. It's not pretty, but when you're up against a stronger team, it's what you have to do. I feel the AI in this game is better than it has been in years past. Opposition knows when they're up against a stronger team, and they pretty much line up 10 guys at the edge of the box, forcing you to have control and possession, taking bad shots, and frustrating your strikers. All the while, they're sucking your defenders in. Fullbacks get too deep, to try for the wide ball, and central defenders slowly creep forward losing the only striker up front. Next thing ya know, they have a 1-on-1, and you're down 1. You get pissed off and say it's broken. I say, change your tactic. Draw the defense out, so press so much. Etc...

Football is a complex game, and FM 16 is just as complex. If you don't want realistic football, if you want to go and rout your opponents at every turn, play FIFA. Managing a team in a realistic setting is frustrating, but it also has it's rewards. And in this version, I feel that SI has finally nailed down a realistic, fun, and interesting experience. 

There are other aspects I haven't touched upon, like the transfers, UI, and press conferences. But other than the new design, it's all pretty much the same old. The new skin looks alright, takes a bit getting used to, but ya know, you can just get a mod. :)",1448900159,1448900159,True,595,96,0.875070154666900635,6,True,False,False

Football Manager is distancing even more from plug and play tactics and strategies in-game, you really need to think, or you're gonna have a bad time. Try different tactics until you have a solid one, then stick with it until you begin to have bad results, can be a result of an patch, player wise or moral.

Match Engine changed this year. You need to have an tactic to Waste Time, this is a must or you're gonna lose or draw every single game, if you're not managing 1st tier teams like Barcelona, Real, Juve, etc. So when you're up by 2 goals (recommended) or 1 and you're being constantly attacked, just change your tactic in the middle of the game to the Waste Time one (you can find those in fm base or change the instructions of your own tactic to defensive and choose the waste time option and the mentality).

Same problems from last 2 years, players frequently asking to play. Injuries festival.

But the game holds up, feel like assistant manager is better, alongside your staff. GKs are definitely better in ME, and you can really make different tactics work depending on your squad. LLM still cool to play.

Prior to playing read reviews and tons of complaints about The Reds being practically a ""hospital"" team with injuries happening more often than one could imagine. Rushed into the game with a desire to explore a little bit before starting it again in a serious way. Spent 60hrs in it, mostly at the bottom of the table, and occasionally having only 3 subs due to everyone else in 25-player first team squad being injured!?!! Additionally, players (those luckily healthy and fit) were making beginner mistakes during matches, tactics would not work no matter what, half of the team was unhappy, the board dissatisfied. The things went south. So, it was either the game was a complete fail, or I was doing something wrong, and after decades of playing football manager games (amongst others) my proficiency went terribly bad. 

I love this game series a lot, have loved it since the very beginning. It was really hard to believe this FM 16 was so bad. I decided to try with the most serious approach I can have, and think about every micro detail this game has to offer. 

Started for the second time. Made only a few, minor adjustments with staff management. Dedicated MUCH more time and attention to training, both team and individual. Following that, explored tactics before and during matches. Sold two players, bought three young ones, used them on rotation, so nothing special with transfers. The Reds are now in the middle of the first season after about additional 60hrs into the game. There are no more two-left-feet shows during matches. Injuries are hardly noticeable, just to remind they are part of the game. Squad harmony is at the highest level. The club is still in all major competitions, and in the Premier League just about 10 points behind the leading Arsenal. The board offered a new contract after only six months. Basically, I was the one who screwed up big time when trying the game out for the first time. Or I just got really, really lucky now in the second try, the game is bugged and glitches, so it just looks as it plays well?

Long story short, in my opinion, the game looks good and polished comparing the previous versions. Everything seems more than fine when playing it in a professional way, after all, it’s a manager game. And the matches look better than ever. So far, the only con I might agree with (not saying that I agree with that angle) would be, per some people the arguably high price for a yearly edition, because, we all know, in about year of real life, there will be FM 17 to come out. I’ll leave that to others to debate and enjoy the game as much as I can. I wish that to others as well, while giving thumbs up for this release.

I've been a longtime follower of the series since the early ""Championship Manager"" games. I'm the first to admit that some of the latest games have been subpar, or had too many issues.

However, Football Manager 2016 felt stable since the early access Beta, which was very surprising given how usually it took SI at least a month or two before a patch made the game actually playable. I also feel that this Match Engine, contrary to what other people are saying here, feels much more realistic than the previous one. I only had two or three very unusual results, but people forget that these happen in football in real life.

I can't comment on the 3D graphics (which admittedly, still have a long way before they could be considered ""acceptable"" for this era), as I've always played the series in 2D mode for a more tactical approach. But graphics are most certainly the least of the matters considering a managerial game. 

The new game mode (Fantasy Draft) is awesome, and playing it with friends is a blast too, especially if you're a fan of playing fantasy football. My only complaint, relative to all Network modes, is that the game still feels a bit ""wonky"" while playing online, with people reporting latency issues when issuing commands, but this could be optimized with future patches.

Overall, I would suggest to buy this year's Football Manager, especially if you've been holding off last year, as this has one of the most realistic Match Engines of the series. The interface has been polished as well, with particular care to the Tactics section, which is now more ""graphic"", and the new set pieces tab is a very nice touch. Speaking of Touch, the game mode offers three new skins for the interface that are optimized for touchscreen displays, though it's not the most intuitive option to activate, and they could have done a little more on that part.

The random regen dates in FM16 help stop the 'Internation Bank of U19' cheese... where you could sign day 0 regens (before AI had the chance to offer them Youth Contracts to their home club) for next to nothing... then develop them for two to three years on minimal salary and sell them for truckloads of cash before having to re-sign them

The control I have over who does what seems greater...  and this lets me use previously untenable attacking options because I trust my own defenders to be where I want them... thus allowing me to be stubborn and score the type of goals I want to see... without leaving me wide open to be countered... I also like that I need more than one way to score... but for me I just change the type of cross/tempo/midfield instructions rather than the actual players.....   FM14 you could play 30 years with only one tactic and have your youth team produce specialists in your system....

The simple way to describe it is it's too hard but not in a challenging way, in a totally unrealistic way. The irony this is supposed to be one of the most realistic simulation games you can get. I'm no newbie to FM so am familiar with the tactics and systems but in this game you are instructed by you assistant to change your style constantly through each match. In real life a team has a style of play, they may change it slightly for certain teams or certain periods of matches but no dramatically. In each game I would be told ""retain possesion, play it short"" then 5 mins later ""hit long balls"" it's so random you're not crafting your teams and implementing your style on them, you're just fluffing through each match hoping you win. I gave it two full seasons before quitting forever.
I even downloaded other people's tactics to see if I was just rusty. They would be ok for 2 games them I back to the drawing board. In real life teams don't change styles every 5 games to stay fresh, they adapt and develop but don't have to redefine.
Not only is the above with tactics true but there are other infuriating habits - I went ten games conceding in the last ten mins, normally in injury time. It happens in real life occasionally... twice in a row for a team is very bad luck, five in a row unbelievable, ten times in a row the game loses all credit. This happened even if restarting games and trying different tactics against the same teams. It had no effect.
Another example is penalties. I was awarded 10-12 and scored 2! That would have to be some sort of record. Yet I won 2 penalty shoot outs both against higher opposition when I had hardly any attackers left. It's backwards. The other way round though teams had no problems scoring against me.
Same with red cards, I went from having the cleanest team in the league to the having the worst disciplinary record. Whenever I lost a man I would lose the game (aside from once but I did concede when down to ten men) but when the opposition had a man sent off I never once scored!
As I say it's not hard in a challenging way, it cannot logically be beaten using good tactical sense. It's just playing on luck. Totally unenjoyable.",1448305977,1448305977,False,77,4,0.596917688846588135,6,True,False,False

Beta review:

This is my first review written, and it is for the game series of my life, Football Manager. I took a year off with 2015 and was thus very excited for this year's edition. Mind you that I have only around 4 hours of gameplay so my thoughts may change with even more gameplay. 

First off, the positives. I did not like the interface very much however after some changes it is now amazing. Moreover, the gameplay mechanics, although taking some time to get used to, are top-notch as is the 3D match engine. Really great work there SI! I can really see all individual changes to my tactics which have been rather ""weak"" at times in the earlier editions. It is, by just pure gameplay and interface, the best FM I have ever played (and I've played all the way since the beginning). Yet there are some negatives with the game, although im not too concerned as I think it is probably because of the BETA version that they are there. So I expect them to be fixed in the final version. Here they are:

Firstly, the injuries. My god, half my team are suffering from injuries and Im just a few games into the season. I know that this has always at some point been a problem with this series but I have never experienced such an injury-prone team. Secondly, Man United are just crazy when it comes to signings (which could be say to be rather realistic :D), but this has affected my team in a very negative way. United have tried to buy Kane, Chadli, Lamela and Bentaleb while succeding in buying Vertonghen and Fazio. Now all of those players are made that I did not let them go to United, and it doesnt matter whatever I say to them as now they all want to leave and have abysmal form... to top that off, several other players of my team are mad at me for the way i've handled this situation. I mean this is so strange for me, I mean okay one or two but these many players?? And it seems that every decision I make has to be explained and justified to my players who, whatever I say (i've tried it), will be mad at me. Lastly, some really strange evaluation of certain players which makes the game a tad unrealistic. E.g. I sold Fazio for 25 million euros to United. 

Yet, all in all, this game is rad. However, these ""anomalies"" need to be fixed in the final version as otherwise, it makes a hell of a frustrating game.

Maybe this was not much of a review but whatever.

Edit: Review of Final Game

Alright so after having a closer look at the final version I must unfortunately say it got even worse. I do not think it is fair by SI to sell this game for full price when the match engine is so painstakingly broken, it literally sucks the fun out of the rest of the game which is really entertaining. I've been playing with Hibernian in the Scottish League and although it has gone actually quite good, every time I play a game I get reminded of how shit the ME really is.. 

First of, the crosses are still unbelievable powerful, does not matter what tactic or what team you use (also played with Tottenham and FC United), you will concede from crosses every single game. Secondly, the most dangerous times of the game are beginning of the match and the start of the 2nd half. I clocked it and I either score or concede (mostly this) in either minute at least every 2nd game. Does not matter what you do, this will happen.. Thirdly, chances. The opponents need only 1-2 shots on goal to score while you can have up to 10-15 shots and still not score. And this happens waay to often for it to be realistic. Moreover, the mistakes your defender makes are just ridicuolus as they often just decide to either lose the ball as the last man or simply just pass it to the closest attacker or even better just straight in your own goal. I mean come on, sure this can happen but this happens all the god damn time. I'm sick of your sh*t SI, how can you even make the full game even worse than the Beta version? If the game is not playable, then for god's sake do not release it. There have always been some minor problems and glitches upon release, however, this is like nothing I've experienced before.

NEGATIVES
-You lose to 3rd division teams... frequently ; 
- No goals opportunities(when you really need to win) even maxing the offensive mentality and the most offensive tactic
-no last minute wins against the ai, the opposite happens a lot
-bad goalkeepers, goals going through them is frequent
-Mourinho simulator: almost evey team will enter a slump of results, resulting in the most unrealistic match results and final standings(Barca AI is at 7th place right now )
-strugle to score when opposition scores first(happens a lot, losing 1-0 and the opposition basically sitting doing nothing)
-1st minute opposition goals: the game makes you feel like its normal to concede goals on the first atack15 seconds into the game! it happens a lot in this game trust me! ive been managing two clubs(sporting clube portugal and leeds utd)

Tactics that you have embedded into your team will NEVER work, players never seem to want to pass the ball, instead just standing in one spot trying to flick and turn against an opposition player, whilst having a man in acres of space who can build to a better attacking position left out in the cold. Players will needlessley head the ball on when they have 10 minutes to bring it down and control it. Your players will make desicions that range from daft to downright bonkers. Goalkeepers who aren't sweeper keepers will charge out to gather the ball whilst ignoring the 8 other opponents that have somehow managed to get inside the box with ease. As your pacey winger is darting downfield, a defender with a pace rating of 7 will manage to overtake and claim the ball. It feels as though everything designed in game is made to benifit the opposition AI as they will always score goals that seem ludicrous, whilst your players constantly shoot wide and high 2 feet from goal. 

I watch alot of FM players online and constantly wonder if I am playing the same bloody game, now I'm certainly not the best FM player, but I have certainly felt the highs and lows the games are usually known for, with FM12 being the personal preferance as that game seemed to have a good balance with it's mechanics and AI, you really could go on an amazing run of games only to have a surprise upset on the cards. 

I can't say the same magic is felt here though, it is all downhill, from the first game in charge, if you lose, there will be no way to pick yourself up, teams that you should easily beat, will EASILY beat you, and your players will never perform at a level that is ever acceptable.

But it is Football Manager, so of course I'm hooked. I'm sure when I'm 1000 hours into the game I would of finally won a game",1447963088,1447963088,False,12,1,0.514716446399688721,1,True,False,False

First, the 2016 version was the most expensive available on the launch date. But it seems clear is that the efforts and resources have been used to take a coach to the edge of the field and the game interface in general. The game engine has regressed.

Several matches of the best leagues seem to be the lower divisions of European championships. Players do not have any reproach to fail, fail and fail. Not to mention that it's not uncommon to see your team concede almost all the goals in the same way: Crossing. [b] No matter what you try to do to change [/b]. And moreover, in a half season I conceded three goals of crossings that fall straight into the goal. Those unintentional. I was playing in Serie A (Italy).

Finally, the game is heavier than ever. A simple alt + tab to access the internet while the game is simulated is enough to make any video or site becomes very slow.

I could speak a lot about other issues like interface, injuries, lack of more complex choices about tactics or finance, but what really bothered me was the poverty of the game engine.

I have been playing the series since CM 1998 and never once have I regretted purchasing the games until now.  

Why the negative review?  Because in my opinion the Match Engine is simply broken.  Defending just doesn't work and is commical.  In 5 matches my keeper (Prem division) conceded 3 goals that slipped through his fingers and two goals from defender back passes.  

I have spent the last 8 hours trying different tactics and formations and it seems very little actually affects gameplay.  Players do not follow instruction, defenders do not defend and goalies seem to make mistakes every game.  

In addition, players do not follow instruction and seems regardless of what tactic/formation results do not alter (as mentioned, have been testing).  

I have read they are looking to release a patch to fix some of the issues.  I will revisit this review at a later date and amend it if the patches actually fix the issues, but right now, I cannot recommend this game and would suggest sticking with 2015 instead until this has been patched to a playable state.

Transfers are also rediculous, with clubs demanding absolutely outrageous amounts for players, for example Alexandre Lacazette who could be signed for about the 20 mil mark in fm 15 apparantly warrants an 80 mil transfer demand on this game... i know transfer amounts are high in real life these days but this seems a bit high to me.

The only thing i can say that is improved is the look of the match engine, which seems to flow much better, even if your players do seem to have issues controlling th ball now.

Overall i honestly dont think this is worth the money, and i would reccomend sticking with fm15 as all this game amounts to is an update... with an uglier UI.",1447601494,1447601494,False,25,1,0.509912431240081787,0,True,False,False

As far as the ingame match engine goes, it actually seem worse than the FM15 with A L O T of horrible bugs and completly unrealistic things happening. Closing down, marking, passing and keeper work is abysmal. Keepers on Premier level are conceding goals in such a way you most definatley will struggle to keep all of your hair intact after a few hours play.

As mentioned the closing down is also a freakin joke. Top players running passed the ball instead of collecting it, retarded man marking or closing down where palyers seems to have opposite magnets attached to them.

I could go on and on and on and on and on about why you should NOT buy this game, but take my word for it. If i could get a refund i would, and i've bought every single game since the first Championship Manager back in the early 90's.

New bits:
-Create a manager is a bit too gimmicky, not really much of a worthwhile addition
-Set Piece Creator is a massive improvement, allowing much more tactical depth
-Fantasy League is great fun with friends and if you have nay you should definitely give it a go
-Prozone analytics are extremely useful if you can put the time and effort. Usually if you are struggling, you can dig into the reasons why and make adjustments
-Create a club allows you to add a whole new level of personal attachment (although this was never a problem with FM

Even though I haven't clocked that much YET in this game, I've already clocked thousands of hours into FM 10,11, and 14. This year's version boasts a couple of changes that bring a new face to the game. 

PROS:
-Management roughly every team in the whole known football league
-Mods and updates from community can keep the game alive
-Football
-New tactic interface looks sweet

Neutral:
-The new UI interface is a bit weird for me as I've been used to older aliterations, but that's a minor thing.
-Injuries are quite annoying. I've gotten around 6 injuries before the start of the season, though I am playing a lower league team in the non-league football, so I guess it is justified.
-Japan and German don't have real players in the national team due to licencing issues, but can be fixed with a mod.

There's not that much cons from my point of view, but I haven't gotten that far yet to notice. So all in all I would recommend this game. You might be confused at the beginning, but once you understand it, you will not let go. I once stayed on one save for 20 years of management with Vauxhall as the best team in the world.

FM15 was the worst and most frustrating version ever, and only time will tell if this is a genuine improvement and will prevent me from ending up in hospital (again) with a self-inflicted fractured skull. 

I probably should wait for the proper version to be released before reviewing as the match engine in the BETA version is clearly messed up (I replayed the same fixture 3 times with the same 2 players getting sent off each time, despite making tactical changes) and there are a few glitches which should be fixed by the release date.

Pros vs FM14:
1. I really do think that game engine and your players AI was significantly increased. After playing about 20 matches I can tell for sure that watching them is far more interesting. 
2. In FM14 you couldn't tell the difference between well skilled player and semi pro player from Southern Football League Premier Division. Ale the goals were scored  pretty much the same way. In FM16 you can really see the difference between technical and non-technical player. Variety of plays and ways goals are being scored.
3. In FM14 defenders AI was absolutely terrible. I know that players from lower leagues can be bad but come one. Many times my GK or defenders were just standing there an looking at a loose ball and do nothing. Just nothing. In my opninion in FM16 there is less amount of stupid and annoing defensive mistakes - it seems more realistic.
4. Way better animations. Players seem to have much more skills.

Cons vs FM14:
1. Just a terrible, sickening, huge amout of yellow cards. When I step up  an aggressive tackling I ended up wiht a red card  in almost every single game. This must be some kind of glitch because it's just impossible. 
UPDATE: I've changed tackling to normal and I still get a red card (2 times yellow) in every third, fourth match.

I've been playing since 2008 and once again FM has improved the game from it's already high standards.
Prozone is an awesome addition to the game allowing you to see stats from all the leagues you have enabled for your database.
Changing of tactics feels like it has more of an influence on the game now, such as changing of mentalities (attacking, control, counter etc)

Still stupidly addicitive too, I find myself sneaking an hour in during work time or going to bed 2 hours later than planned due to 'one more game...'

It's about time that happened as well as some aspects in the game were getting really quite dated, especially the match engine.

On the subject of the match engine: It really looks like they have tackled this in 2016, especially regarding the goalkeeper and defence, who now actually interact as players on the pitch instead of just going through the motions for the engine.

Tactics ACTUALLY seem to work for once, so asking for direct football will actually get you direct football with forceful wingers and killer balls attempted.  They had started to try and fix this in 2015, but still seemed like they were going through the motions to mask a pretty average match engine. 

I am really enjoying the new detailed staff page as well, you can now see exactly who is doing what at the club, and where your club ranks in the league at staff skills.  This was always an underdeveloped part of the game for me, as a club's backroom staff is just as important as the players on the pitch.

I hear the prozone is good as well, but not something I have looked at in detail as of yet.

There are, however, still some issues:

The blighted over developed press conferences are still in the game.  MY GOD these are boring, and I don't think SI actually realise how dull they have made this, which is ironic as a lot of development time seem to have gone into making it 'intuitive'.  Let's make this clear though - intuitive means nothing if it isn't entertaining.  My solution is simple...drop all the press nonsense, that just kills playing time, and allow people to have a preset button which gives you avatar a way of dealing with the press - range it from 'conspiracy theorist' right through to 'upbeat and passive'.  You can then change you demeanor as and when you see fit - so if you are in a slump you can do the 'world is against us' mentality if you wish to, without having to spend 5 mins reading through very dull rhetorical journo questions! The whole 'get your assistant manager to do it' just doesn't wash for me either, as press management is an important part of creating a team mentality.

The interface still looks like it was developed by a sociopath, however I get SI not caring too much as Steklo will no doubt just create a great new indie Skin over the next couple of months anyway.

Pros: 
+ New Prozone match analysis is extremely useful especially for those who create their own tactics, and speaking of tactics; the tactics manager is refined and is easier to use than ever. With a completely redesigned set piece creator that makes the difference between building a winning tactic and a losing one much more distinct. It's easier to see where your tactics are going wrong / right, and because of this, if it's going wrong you're going to be able to figure it out much more easier than last year's iteration. 
+ Draft Mode is a winner, Who doesn't love fantasy football? Now you can have it inside your favourite football management sim.
+ Injuries aren't as horrifically prominent as they were during the early builds of last year's game. 
+ Create-A-Club mode allows you to create your own team and lead your creation to glory. (Replaces a team in the league you choose)
+ Realistic data for almost every player in the WORLD playing across tens of thousands of different leagues. That's just phenomenal!
+ Refined matchday Engine with better 3d graphics.
+ Still easily the best football management simulation in the world, and most likely it forever will be with the sheer amount of work put into this database. This game is a literal universe inside your PC, load it up and you'll be sucked into another dimension where suddenly YOU were actually good at football in the past, and have retired to lead Wigan Athletic to champions league glory. 

Meh:
= Press interaction is slightly more varied this year, no more pressing random buttons and hoping you didn't say something to piss your star player off. The new conferences will keep you intrigued for at least the first 24 hours of gameplay. (Then it's back to your ol' Assistant Manager because you have nothing to say A la Jose Mourinho)
= Customizing your own manager is neat, but it lacks options. There are only a few different choices for hair styles, colors, and outfits. It doesn't prove to be the immersive feature it is advertised as, because I couldn't copy my likeness. 
= The beta is not without it's fair share of bugs, from the silly, to the game crashing; and i'm sure the first versions of the full game are likely to have some too, but it's to be expected with the sheer size of this game. It will just get better over time though, as the devs are highly active and the final version of FM15 was almost bug free from my experience.

So for so good, things are going smoothly for me, no real issues to report, Haven't experienced the injury crisis or poor keeping (YET). So on my side seems like an improvement from FM15 for sure! Now with a bit more depth, the interface is very likable once you get used to it. It may look a bit messy at the start, but in fact once you've adapted, you realise how useful the new function and layout really is. Players do quite well according to their stats, though sometimes i am a bit frustrated by random upsets, but i guess it mimics real life right?

Anyway, the game is a good platform so for, BETA has been good, no big issues on my part. Maybe keepers should be a little touch better, but nothing really alarming so far. The players also could be a little more decisive as i notice they are a bit slow to react to situations, but i guess its a game, again not a big issue.

To me, the most critical issue with the game, would be the crazy transfer fees requested by clubs for their players (8/10 of my bids were asking for a fee way above the real life price that they would be sold for). So this one i would like to be fixed. Maybe a bit more reasonable valuation of players as well. Cause for example I in no way can see that Falcao is still worth 35Million Pounds.

Overall, good game, look forward to the full release in 2 weeks.",1446283624,1446283624,True,5,0,0.560399830341339111,0,True,False,False

Just some quick comments:

1.  The goalie AI is miles better.  The reactions are more realistic, and diving saves are made when they are meant to.  A lot less opposition goals scored with keeper just standing there.  I feel like my team has a locked door again!!

2.  The defence AI is also much improved.  Where last year they would let players through easily, there is a real feeling that the defenders respond to tactics you set and that makes such a positive difference.  

3.  I love the new animations for scoring, celebrating, remonstrating, falling and tackling.  I really like the little flicks of the ball that have been introduced as well.  Also some nice improvements in the build of players' faces on the pitch.  My computer was rated 3* for graphics, but there has been no problem with the best quality setting being used.

4.  The new tactics screen is super.  It makes it a lot more clear to use the 'pie' graphic to show whether the players are suited to a position and now a role.  Much much better.

5.  The new manager builder is a great idea.  I kind of managed to match my face but I have heavy stubble and glasses - any chance that SI could introduce facial hair and glasses settings for this?  Wouldn't mind so much if it was just for the match engine, but my attempt at my face comes up whenever I am quoted on screen and whatever.  However, that is the only thing I don't like about the manager builder.

6.  Injury frequency is much fairer than in FM15.  I no longer have an injury list the size of Glasgow.  I've gone from a consistent injury list of 8 first team players out to just 1 or 2 - much more realistic.  This makes such a difference SI - please don't change it when you release the final version.  

7.  Injury type and associated time out of the team is much better balanced than in FM15.  The option to play through injury is good too.  SI have listened to us here, which is excellent.  I was kind of dreading playing this game after forking out for the beta, simply because the injury system crippled FM15 in my eyes, and I was afraid that this would be more of the same.  I am very happy that I have been proved wrong.

8.  The prozone tactical system is great.  Now we can access substitutions in a much slicker fashion, and it doesn't take an age to go through.  This helps the game continue quickly.  

9.  There is a definite distinction between match fitness and match sharpness, and both affect the performance of the players in their own way.  A lot of thought has gone into this, and it works extremely well, even in beta. 

Can you tell I'm a little impressed??

10.  I haven't tried the team builder yet but looking it over, it seems a great option.  I'll comment more fully when I have the chance.

SI, thank you for giving us a much better offering (so far) this season.  I will be playing this version of FM a lot more than I played the last one.",1446168469,1446194475,True,85,4,0.801431417465209961,4,True,False,False

[b]Hey guys, I'm about to write my first impressions about the game, but keep in mind that this is beta / pre-order version. Also, this review is intended for Football Manager players that already know how to play this game.[/b]

Pros: 


[list]
    [*] Most advanced animations yet in any Football Manager edition. What I mean by that is the fact that FINALLY you can see the difference in Flair / Quality between 2 players. New dribblings, crosses, decisions and finishing in front of goal. It was FM13 since I've been asking for more realistic dribblings / decisions / crosses in the final third but the game never got quite there, until now. Let me give you a short example: I am playing as AC Milan and Jeremy Menez was attacking the right flank as a Winger-Attack. In any of the previous versions, he would have done 3 possible things: attack the byline and cross, cutting into the penalty area or pass the ball back to the overlappting full back. Now, I noticed something absolutly beautiful: He did neither of those. His decision was to dribble 2 players like they were nothing by cutting inside the penalty area and then he launched a lobbed-cross to Luiz Adriano who was rushing forward from a deeper position. Now, besides his way of dribbling (which i've never seen before in FM), we can easily notice another MAGNIFICENT improvement: lobbed crosses. This kind of crosses are a must in a game like FM and I am finally happy it was introduced. So yes, new animations / decisions / dribblings / crossings. You can finally see the difference between 15 Flair and 18 Flair so to speak.
    [*] Game is in a much better state beta wise than it was last year (loading times, match engine and leagues)
    [*] Fast loading / saving times. Last year's beta was awful regarding saving times. It was something that eventually got fixed, but FM16 doesn't have this problem at all. In fact, to me it seems than the game loads/saves faster than FM15.
    [*] 3D Match Engine is another thing that pleasantly surprised me (played 3 games). By this I mean it feels smoother, no visible glitches and artefacts. Last year we had all sorts of problems with 3d engine performance until it got fixed (the game ran choppy and stuttering a lot on anything above ""medium"" quality no matter how powerful your machine was). In this regard, FM 2016 shines right from the start. I am able to play the game on highest graphical settings.
    [*] One of the biggest improvements in my opinion is ProZone analysis tool. This tool is so so much better than what we had before. If you are the kind of manager that likes to keep tabs on every aspect of the tactic you are creating, than I swear, ProZone is exactly what you've been waiting for. 
    [*] New tactical framework is excelent  in my opinion, definetly much better than last year's, especially if you are a newcomer to the game. For new players it is much easier to make them understand what each setting does and for the experienced players, well, it makes their ""job"" easier.
    [*] Another pro of FM 16 is the actual Player Profile Screen which wasn't completly revamped but the slight adjustments SI made are welcome. You can get almost every necessary info about a player just by clicking Profile Tab.
    [*] Contract negociations screen has been completly revamped and its new look is very neat. It wasnt bad in any of the previous versios, but these new adjustments are always welcome.
[/list] 

Cons:

[list]
    [*] The only con that I feel I must put out is how the Formation Tactic screen looks like. By this, I mean the players on the pitch in the tactics screen. I feel that player's ""thumbnail"" takes way way too much space than it needs to. This gives me some sort of claustrophobic feeling. This is something that bothers me, but it might not bother anybody else.
[/list]

Now, I didn't write about all the new features that SI has introduced because that's not relevant for this review. I felt like I only need to adress things that need to be adressed considering the game is still in BETA state. This said, I conclude this review by stating that FM16 BETA seems far better than FM15 BETA and I will enjoy every minute of it. I will write a full review after the game comes out in the final version (13 November). By then I will know more. Consider this review, as a review at a glance if you will. Enjoy the best football manager simulator out there.
