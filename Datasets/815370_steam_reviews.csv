Green Hell captivates players with an incredible story and breathtaking aesthetics. The game offers a challenging experience in a positive way. To survive, you must comprehend the rules and resources of the rain-forest. Just like in real life, situations can take a downturn swiftly, so preparation for anything is crucial. However, once you grasp the basics, the game becomes a relaxing and immersive adventure.

One noteworthy aspect is that many players might not be aware that the game has a complete second storyline - 'Spirits of Amazonia.' This expansion not only extends the gameplay but also presents a longer and more challenging narrative. If you find yourself engrossed in the main story, don't forget to explore this additional content.

Overall, Green Hell is a solid 10/10 survival game. It's evident that the developers poured their souls into the game, creating an experience that truly resonates with players. I highly recommend it.",1708869200,1708869200,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the stunning visuals to the intense survival mechanics, every aspect of this game is finely crafted to keep you on the edge of your seat.

The lush jungle environment is breathtakingly beautiful, yet it also presents constant challenges that keep you engaged and eager to explore further. The attention to detail in the world-building is remarkable, making every step feel like a true adventure.

The survival mechanics are incredibly realistic, forcing you to scavenge for resources, manage your health and sanity, and navigate the dangers of the wilderness. It's a thrilling test of skill and strategy that keeps you thinking on your feet at all times.

But what truly sets Green Hell apart is its immersive storytelling. The narrative unfolds in a series of mysterious flashbacks, gradually revealing the secrets of the protagonist's past and the true nature of the jungle. It's a gripping tale that keeps you hooked from start to finish.

Overall, Green Hell is a masterpiece of a game that delivers both excitement and depth in equal measure. Whether you're a fan of survival games or just looking for a thrilling adventure, this game is an absolute must-play. Better I request number of max player can be increased.

Weak story and my not fun, go-in-blind initial playthrough give this 2/5. However, survival mode is much better, but you still need to look things up because trial and error gets old quickly. It makes sense a scientist wouldn't know survival skills, but I would've preferred a few more base knowledge things like how to boil water, how to make a bidon, and how to make a spear. I would love to pair The Forrest protagonist with this world. 

My initial play-throughs of the story: Not too thrilled by this game. Even a walk in the park is not a walk in the park if you can't find anything to help you. I've been searching for at least two hours for any nuts/fatty items, I can't find antivenom things, I can't figure out how to boil water - putting it on the fire puts out the fire - how to use the plants like tobacco, and so on and so forth. I would think a person who voluntarily goes into the jungle would know more than this PC does. That, and the save system. I thought sleeping in a bed saved, but no, only sleeping in certain beds. So when I died after four hours of gameplay, I started from the very beginning and I quit. I hate to have to read up on how to do everything. No hand holding really means your character is dumb, and it requires you to stay put in one spot for a long time to try everything out. Even then, things don't make much sense. I don't need that many nuts in a day. I should be able to easily boil water on a fire. I should know more about the plants and how to use them, or at least how to cook them or craft with them since trial and error seems to do nothing. Do not recommend unless you are prepared to pre-read everything before attempting to play. 

I finally gave up and played on Tourist mode to do the main story. It was okay. There are logic issues that are caused by the tutorial, which is never a good thing. Does the story make me want to recommend this game? Not really. However, if you read up on everything first so you go in prepared, then you can give it a shot, especially the survival mode with no story involved. It needs a better save system, tweaks to the nutrients system (you really, really don't need that many nuts in a few days), and more logic behind the water. 

Wait for it to be on sale, and read on how to play beforehand. ",1707607563,1708297595,True,0,0,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,False

You stay 80% the time eating, searching for things to eat, passing out and dying because you either got bitten by a rattle snake (that basically only makes noise if you step over it), drank water from the river and got parasites (all the time, which is very unrealistic, if the water comes from a pond, them it makes sense, but from a flowing river/waterfall, it doesn't) or a worm is draining all your energy and sanity.

After staying away from Green Hell for a few years, I'm glad to say it has seen dramatic improvements. The issues I experienced before have not come back, the frame rate is always consistent, and even loading times seem to be a little quicker. I've been enjoying my time back in Hell.


Glitchy as hell.  So much for a 1.0 release.  I love the idea of a realistic survival game that has a focus on gathering food, supplies, and maintaining physical as well as mental health.  What I absolutely hate is the fact that enemy spawns are absolutely broken as hell.  My friends and I got ambushed by somewhere around 30-40 tribal warriors and I can't imagine that is supposed to happen.  We killed off dozens but dozens more replaced them instantly.  We watched the enemy warriors duplicate themselves out of thin air.  There were so many enemies spawning and running around at once that I'd go from a solid 60fps to less than 10 whenever I was in the same game cell as them.

Also, unlike other survival games where food and water are less important and don't really hinder one's experience, your well being and sanity will depend heavily on these elements.

Interactions, such as using elevators or water bottles, can become inaccessible.  The game can glitch and prevent you from drawing the bow.  Game corruption can drop you from 150 FPS to 12 FPS.

I loved the story, and I really like survival games, but the loss of progress due to game corruption is a deal breaker.  Play this game if you want to do short runs, if you want to be a nomad and don't expect anything outside your inventory to persist.

There is also an abundance of resources and no way to tune it.  Don't expect to struggle much in finding food, water, shelter, particularly once you figure out how to make a bow and that you can eat pretty much everything you find once you cook it in a coconut shell.  The resource spawning is a check that is made as you view the spawn points, so you might be looking at an empty banana tree, turn around and turn back, and now there are bananas to harvest.  The difficulty of the game is just jump-scare style fights with tribal raiders (which often don't spawn due to other bugs) and jump-scare style fights with big cats (which aren't a threat if you have a bow and see them coming).

I really wanted to like this game, but there are too many progress-stealing bugs.

You can even craft certain tiers of equipments and buildings and even cultivate plants or tame animals. The campagin story is surprisingly well done and interesting, this was the biggest surprise for me. There also came a free update with a dlc story which is the prequel to the original campaign.

There is also a survival (endless mode) coop and a new challenge mode. By now you can even play both types of campaging in coop as well. The last update also released a horde mode, which I did not test yet.

If you like survival games you should most definitely buy this game.",1707863595,1707863595,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The environment is interesting in the first few hours, until you realize that there is just not that much going on. Same goes for the building system. It is far from unique and quite shallow with not that many options.
Sound was ok, the comments and sounds the player makes over and over again get annoying quickly, eg. when drinking unsafe water.
The story felt surprisingly unrewarding and not satisfying to finish at all, and I was really disappointed with the endings. Biggest let down of the game besides the shallowness of environment & building.

Second, why are the tribesmen's hairstyle shaped like their main village's layout in the story. THAT'S WHACK

Anyway, I love survival games and green hell is definitely in my top 5. The story was good and there's multiple endings. I predicted both endings correctly but it doesn't make it any less emotionally traumatic. 

I love how immersive it is, the environment is also your enemy. I like how the health bar is split into four sections where you have to maintain your protein, carbs, fats and water intake. Building and crafting system is pretty good.

The part i don't like the most is when you can cure venom bites with painkillers. I know there's a tobacco dressing for the venom wound but why can't we extract venom from snakes If we can extract poison from the poison dart frog?

Monkeys would be cool to add, although i hate the idea of monkeys kicking my ass and stealing stuff from my base.. that would be really cool.

For survival mode, I feel like there should be more maps or at least be like a randomly auto generated map/seed like minecraft because I have already memorized most of the map even though it's large.

Overall a great game, but my biggest complaint is that co-op experience tends to be a bit buggy, and there's not really an autosave feature for solo play.

1. This game has way to many issues with crashing. My game crashes constantly. I can't play for more than a few hours on coop without the game crashing. I can't load into the game and talk on discord at the same time or the game crashes. 

2. Bandages don't work properly. If you get bitten by a snake you are supposed to apply a tobacco dressing as per the wiki. You get about 15 seconds to do that unless you are peak mental and physical condition and it literally never works. Scorpions, spiders, frogs, none of the bandages work. 

3. Time invested in maintaining the character is way too long. You could spend a solid hour or more getting your team up to a point where you can travel from your camp and a tiger attacks or a tribe attacks or within 10 minutes be all dead or limping back home to spend the next 90 minutes getting ready to go again. It really takes the fun out of the game when you only make it out of camp 50% of the time. 

4. Crafting is a chore and serves minimal benefit. There is so much effort involved in creating anything coupled with maintaining your character that it's borderline not even worth it. Throw some coconut shells on the ground to collect water. You might be saved from a tiger if you craft a decent shelter but a tribe will tear it all down pretty quickly.

5. Navigation is meh. I get it, I get what it's about. It's still cumbersome when you have everything stacked against you. I have been bitten by spiders and attacked by tigers looking at my map - and good luck getting home before you die if that happens. 

To be honest, if not for the crashing, I would give this game a positive review. It's just so disheartening to have your game crash after finally progressing. You can't be saving every 5 minutes and if you finally get moving and get out to explore for 30 minutes and the game crashes it's basically like ""what's the point"".",1612586052,1706492968,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You'll find a lot of reviews mentioning how this game is like The Forest. It's a fair comparison on the surface, and it's fair to say you'll enjoy Green Hell if you enjoyed The Forest. Green Hell co-op is like The Forest co-op, but with a lot more glitches (and The Forest has its fair share) and a LOT more threats. I died. Spectacularly. And often.

Within the first five minutes, a rattlesnake bit me and I died. Upon respawning, I decided to take a nap to replenish some energy only to wake up covered in worms. I attempted to kill something for food and bones (because my notebook insisted bone shards would help me with worms), but I failed. So, I drank some water instead because my guy kept complaining about being thirsty. I ended up with 4 stacks of parasites. Trying to figure out how to cure them and panicking about the flashing symbols on my HUD alerting me of my imminent death, I picked up a poison dart frog without bothering to read that it was a poison dart frog. It sapped what little health I had left and I died again. After I respawned yet again, I was dead within about 30 seconds when I ate something that gave me food poisoning. As my character continued vomiting every few steps, my macros plummeted. It didn't take long for me to fall over and die a third time. This cycle of dying and respawning happened for my first several hours of gameplay, and keep in mind that my squad was also repeatedly dying around me so our collective sanity was abysmal. I turned down the game's volume for fear of actually losing my sanity to the constant voices in my head as I watched this poor guy curl up into the fetal position in the mud, pass out from exhaustion, and subsequently die because I didn't know how to keep him alive for longer than a few minutes.

The learning curve was steep. 90 degrees, I'd say. I went in blind, and it ultimately made the survival element a [b]lot[/b] more satisfying once I figured out how to, y'know, [i]not[/i] die every few minutes.

The game has beautiful and immersive sound and visuals. Lots of audio cues that can help save your life.

We've experienced a lot of glitches in co-op mode: invisible natives that only appear when they die, weapons vanishing from hands, storage boxes randomly sorting and mixing items up, the inability to pick things up or interact with anything that's fixed only by a reset, items flying across the screen, getting stuck in the water, dead fish endlessly splashing in and out of the water making this loud buzzing sound, and just overall lag. None of it has kept me from enjoying the game, but it might bother someone looking for a more seamless experience.

My other gripe has to do with the guy you're playing. While I haven't played story mode yet and don't know his deal, I get [b]very[/b] tired of his almost [i]constant[/i] whining. I get he's in a terrible situation, but his persistent moaning and groaning got very annoying very quickly.

Overall, Green Hell is a pretty intense and rewarding experience if you jump into it blind, and I highly recommend that you do.",1588663471,1706046957,True,89,14,0.893525958061218262,0,True,False,False

In this leech removing simulator, you play as Jake Higgins, an absolute imbecile of a man who can't walk over logs or tell which part of his body hurts without inspecting every limb and packs his bag like a die-hard Tetris fan. He can't carry more than 50-pounds on his back without crawling on the ground and thought it was a good idea to wear t-shirt and shorts to one of the most dangerous environments in the world. At least he had the foresight to not wear sandals or crocs. Jake Higgins is simultaneously a strong man and yet one of the weakest men you'll ever meet. You'll be able to tear apart logs with your bare hands and carry 2 logs on your shoulder at once but be unable to carry 7 banana leaves. He has a 2-inch vertical jump and can run for about 200 feet on a good day.

You'll start your game out with normal nutrient depletion not realizing Jake has every single tapeworm in Brazil in his body and then go turn it down after you realize you just spent the past 5 hours of game play foraging for food to keep your vitals up. Perhaps to augment his unusual body composition, you will learn that he needs a full 8 hours of sleep every 4 hours and needs to eat his body weight in food in those 8 hours and runs the risk of dying by dehydration no less than 3 times in those 8 hours. He has an aversion to eating human meat and spiders but is down to snack on human bones and rubbing those spiders into a wound.

But enough about him, let's go onto the actual game. Green Hell is a survival game where harvesting resources is incredibly easy but tedious and slow. Harvesting resources is a matter of pressing E randomly while walking around or a few swings with an axe. Like most survival games that use wood, you can't cut down like 90% of the trees but the trees you can cut down takes like 4 swings of the axe to drop. Trees drop 2 logs and 2 long sticks but recipes will need 3 logs or long sticks. You'll get at most 10 rocks in your play through so make sure you treasure them. Food and water is a non-issue because eating random things off the ground as you travel around will not only suffice, they can and will cure any ailments you have.

You can hear literally every threat to your well being before you see them and pull out your trusty level 1 bow to instantly kill the aggressor. Once you have your trusty level 1 bow (something you can get 10 seconds into the game) and 2 arrows (just in case you miss your first shot), you are set to beat the game. Once you get armor (something you can do 10 seconds into the game), it doesn't even matter if you missed your first shot as you have become immortal.

The base building portion of Green Hell demonstrates how strong mud walls and jungle tribal men are. Tribal enemies will be able to decimate any mud wall with nothing more than a knife and 3 swings. Sometimes the structures you build are so flimsy and porous, enemies and animals will just walk through them to attack you without damaging the wall at all.

Directional audio is actually amazing once you get past hearing random leaves rustling, random wooden items banging around and Jake Higgins complaining about being hungry, sleepy or thirsty or simply angrily swearing every few seconds.

You start off with a watch that can do everything except wipe your rear end and assemble a plane to fly out.

It's a great survival game, up there with games like The Forest, Subnautica, or Raft -- but what it's trying to do is very different from what those games (and especially a ""survival"" game like Rust) are trying to do. For instance: no tech tree, little real progression, and combat is pretty monotone.

Green Hell's core mechanics revolve around eating, drinking and gathering resources to build with -- but what sets it apart from other survival games is (1) its interface and (2) its pacing.

The interface is challenging. Especially for people accustomed to having a slick inventory screen where many things happen. Instead, Creepy Jar is trying to keep you in the character's head. So your inventory is your backpack, your crafting screen is basically what's on the ground around you, and it's not always clear what will and what won't work together. Or cooking, for example. There's no cooking workstation -- instead, you build a fire and place food at the fire. The food cooks over time, but if you forget about it, it can burn or spoil.

The pacing slows down A LOT once you have a stable living/sleeping spot, understand where to get clean food and water, and can protect yourself. After that, you're exploring. And it turns out that it is REALLY easy to get lost wandering around the Amazonian rainforest.

I love Green Hell. I think it's super fun, has interesting challenges, and it's absolutely worth the low price point. But don't buy it if you're looking for a base-builder like 7 Days to Die or a combat-focused game like Rust.",1705946650,1705946650,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is also much to discover and a great varity of ladscapes, plants and animals!

For a beginner it can be very hard because the tutorial and the journal is not explaining good enough.

What I dont like are the worms under your skin and the leeches, which you get way too often and which is just annoying to search your body and do further steps against it. It would be better if you only get leeches and worms in special situations like if you go into dirty water.

Also the snakes and the spiders are annoying because they attack instant if you are too close to them and dont  flee like normal animals would do. 

Also predators are attacking like bad creatures, but in wildlife they behave different. Also not necessary.
It is ok if the animals attack if you dont react to their warning signs, but the predators attack instant...

Picking up stuff from the ground is also bad in some cases, because the hit boxes are also not right in many cases. It would be good, if you could change the color and color intensity of the glow rim of the items on the ground. For me, they shine way to pride, especially at night.

The clock is completely unnecessary and inconvienent, it would be much better if the lacking nutrition is appaearing at the GUI and you know instant which one you need like you would feel in real life. Also the position and the time could be in the GUI, there is nothing which speak against it.

Firstly I want to say that I love survival games: The Forest (though that was its own steaming hot pile of garbage in its own charming way) and Subnautica are both paragons of the genre, and I really enjoyed the fact that this game takes place against the backdrop of a lush rainforest environment. While the graphics are generally nice to look at, my main gripes involve the mechanics. The story is rather average for a survival game. Firstly, no matter what difficulty we played this game on, we were barraged with constant snake bites, random attacks from the PO'd locals and a ridiculous shortness of stones (which are basic crafting materials and integral to your survival) and food that wasn't nasty little yellow snails. And this remained the typical even as we explored the majority of the map and meticulously searched every corner for consumables and crafting materials. Mind you, we played on every difficulty and got the worst material spawns every time. I'm not sure if it was just our luck or what. The game itself is nothing remarkable, as I mentioned with the storyline being fairly generic for this genre of games. Overall, I can't necessarily recommend nor tear Green Hell to shreds. My review is basically this: it's a meh survival game with decent graphics but the gameplay is sort of lacking.

My character isn't that stupid, is he? Overall game is good but I cannot say the game is good for 1 thing, if I die and then restart I will not sit there and play afterwards solely due to the fact I have to run and get every blueprint again. I wish there were console commands or better cheats online for this game cause I will not be constantly playing this game when I die cause I cannot stand getting some blueprints over and over. The reason I recommend it is because it's a fun game but I just hate the blueprint system, I find it useless, annoying, and overall game-ruining. I know where the log bed is but 99% of the game spawns I get won't spawn me anywhere near it.

-Movement is frustratingly slow.  Walking is the equivalent speed of standing on top of a roomba, sprinting feels like 75% IRL walking speed.  
-Mechanics are so incredibly poorly explained that I felt like I was playing a Dark Souls knock-off.  Your players should not have to DISCOVER how to perform basic functions in your game.  I don't want to fumble through the jungle bashing rocks against things until something happens.  You can not have a 1-step objective like ""build a fire"" when there are 10 or more steps involved.
-Probably the worst implemented (and worst explained) crafting system I've ever encountered.  ""hey look at this journal with a poorly drawn thing.  You recognize those terrible sketches?  Good, use those to build the thing.""  And then you get to look at a bookbag with garbage strapped to it, pick things off the back, and turn them into other things so you can craft the thing.  Realism works just fine in real life, but it should always take a backseat in favor of streamlined UI and mechanics, especially core mechanics (crafting in a crafting-survival game).  Games like Grounded, Subnautica, even Raft don't require you to jump through hoops and layers of UI to perform basic core gameplay functions.

Maybe I'm just grumpy, was having a bad day, etc, but I don't understand the hype.  But that's ok, a game can't get good reviews from everyone.  Maybe I'll give it another shot later down the road and things will click",1705091423,1705091423,False,7,1,0.503922164440155029,1,True,False,False

From the moment we entered the lush and dangerous world of Green Hell, we were captivated by the sheer realism and attention to detail. The vibrant, yet perilous, ecosystem of the Amazon threw every imaginable challenge at us, from jaguars lurking in the shadows to poison frogs, crocs, spiders, and scorpions at every turn.

Surviving in Green Hell is an immersive and intense experience that truly pushes the boundaries of the survival genre. The game's mechanics, combined with its stunning visuals and atmospheric soundscape, create an authentic sense of tension and danger. Each encounter with wildlife felt like a life-or-death situation, and the thrill of overcoming these challenges was incredibly rewarding.

The co-op gameplay added a layer of teamwork and strategy, making survival even more exhilarating. My wife and I found ourselves strategizing, problem-solving, and celebrating every small victory together. The game seamlessly blended exploration, resource management, and crafting, offering a comprehensive survival experience that kept us on the edge of our seats.

In the end, Green Hell stands out as one of the best survival games I've ever played. It's not just a game; it's an adventure, a test of skill, and a thrilling journey into the heart of the Amazon.

Green Hell is a great game if you're looking for a challenging experience and something different in terms of base building. The developers recently made some much needed changes to the storage system and added a means of transportation, both of which have greatly improved the overall experience. 

There is something to be said for a company that is still making improvements on their product and adding new content years after the initial release without charging their customers additional fees to enjoy them.

If I had never played The Forest though, I probably would have shrugged and said this was just a meh survival game. Once I played The Forest, however, I realized just how much worse this game is in comparison.

The best way I can describe this game is like driving a car that breaks down every five minutes. You're constantly wondering when you're going to have to stop to fix something, and by the time you reach your destination you're just glad it's over.

- Game runs poorly even on high end rigs
- Crafting is a chore and finding even a simple rock is a tedious game of hide and seek
- Story is subjective but having the main character talk through everything was boring compared to finding clues and discovering the story out for yourself in The Forest
- The extra ""survival mechanics"" offered here are more like constant annoyances that you have to check and fix every time you do literally anything. You have to pull leeches off your body, treat fire ant bites, and treat scrapes every time you do so much as walk for two minutes
- The sheer amount of injuries your character sustains from the simplest actions is absurd. This guy is so ridiculously fragile that he could stub his toe and be hospitalized for weeks. How this guy survived every day life up to this point is nothing short of a miracle
- The nutrition macro system seems complex to encourage a more robust diet and change the gameplay to suit the needs of your character, but as others have mentioned it's easy to figure out the recipes that trivialize this mechanic
- Sanity is another mechanic that again, only serves as another annoyance that you have to babysit
- Lastly, price. I spent $15 on this game, played for 7 hours, and will never touch it again. I spent $5 for The Forest, played for 25 hours, and I'll eventually buy and play the sequel too. Take that as you will.

Overall if you enjoy Green Hell, hey, more power to you. As for me, I don't recommend this to anyone who played The Forest, and I don't recommend this game over The Forest.",1704573159,1704573159,False,2,1,0.503320038318634033,0,True,False,False

The gameplay can be difficult with finding certain items (plants for instance) to heal your open wounds or suddenly finding yourself being attacked by a jaguar out of nowhere...not to mention the poisonous snakes, spiders and centipedes.

I'm not gonna bore you with a whole lot now, I recently got the game and while I am enjoying it alot...I do have to say one important thing....DEVS...somehow fix the microstutter, the framerate drops massively in the inventory, when crafting to about 20 or less, it's annoying and honestly why is it still an issue.

Do not spoil this game with spoilers. Forget the internet, enjoy the jungle. Learn through suffering and dying and enjoy the treasures Amazonia offers as you find them. 
This review does not contain any spoilers.

Full review:
Originally negative review after 20 hours in coop with friends. Add more 40 hours, both coop and solo, and I am changing my review to positive. The game is quite enticing, compelling and fun. It can suck you in, you'll live in the jungle. And you can easily, and often, get sidetracked by many to-do / to-find / to-figure-out ideas you may have. I love this in games.

Dying in many different ways and figuring out a way to stay alive was a great learning curve for me, and I enjoyed finding a solution (or multiple ones) in-game to each and every issue I had. I am very happy that I did not google a single thing for this game. Well, apart from a few mods - but as of now I play mostly vanilla.

I still find Green Hell rather shallow, very similar to The Forest, which I played and completed, but did not like it too much. It tries to be hardcore realistic in some ways, but there are a lot console-game, arcade style aspects which break the immersion significantly. And in coop it has some annoying glitches like frequent sound of huge object falling/breaking nearby, every minute or so when near your structures.

Viewing distance is very short in this game, so don't bother building huge bases, as you might not see objects you built 50-100 meters from you. And you won't see anything beautiful in distance from high towers you may try to build. But as soon as you don't go crazy fortress builder mode, you're fine.

Tip: If you fancy a nice treehouse, find the huge trees. Smaller platform can definitely be useful, but trying to build bigger structers on that requires a ton of patience and the result won't be as great anyway. I love myself a nice treehouse, happy to see the option in this game.


Reasons for my previous negative review:

In first 20+ hours, during CO-OP Game crashed on my PC every 1-2 hours. Didn't find any solution to it, have new graphics drivers, I even lowered graphic settings as advised, even when on very high it ran smoothly. My brothers played it without a single CTD, so it only affets some hardware I guess.

In the end I found solution via try and error - to unplug my ever-favorite Logitech G-13 keyboard. Without this keyboard, playing was worse, as I really love using it, but I had no crashes at all in about another 20 hours. Later playing solo, I plugged it back in, still had some crashes, but only during certain actions like removing armor etc. and only once in 5-10 hourse, so it's kind of bearable. Less than 0.1% PC gamers use G13 keyboard, so don't worry about suffering the same crash bug.

Then I had issue with super-fast time flow in the game, but it's possible to get used to it and to have not many issues with nutrition and energy, as you get the hang of the game. I originally wrote: ""Also it has very short day-night cycle, and extremely high consumption rates. Most of the game you just care about eating or sleeping, even though all food is abundant around you in the Amazon rainforest. Before you wander few hundred meters, you are already exhausted, starving and it's night, even though you started in the morning fully stuffedn and full of energy. Luckily, this issue can be fixed via mod named ModTime. """,1703950279,1704400948,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Cons: The audio mix can be a little odd. Naturally things are louder as they get closer to you, but at times the animal sounds seem quite a bit louder than they should be. That's all I can come up with. 

Pros: This is the best balance of realism and fun in any survival game I've played. The level of detail from nutrients to first aid, growth of the flora around you, design of structures, etc. You've got to keep your head in the game and pay attention to all the detail or you won't make it far. But it's not so granular that the whole game is just a chore-chart activity of work. 

The ongoing support from Creepy Jar, adding additional content based largely on player feedback, has really kept things fresh. 

The map is huge, considering the pace you need to take in order to survive. Lot's of things to discover and dangers to encounter. 

The ""learning"" system is fantastic. You have a journal that starts largely empty, and it is filled as you experiment and experience different things. Everything you encounter is ""unknown"" until you do something with it (eat it, make a bandage with it, make a brew, etc). You learn how to make different equipment by discovering it in the wild, or experimenting and stumbling across the ""recipe"" on your own. 

I highly recommend, and I haven't even played the story mode, only survival. Great single or multiplayer, though it is much more tense and stressful in single player.",1704245202,1704245202,True,44,1,0.798745810985565186,0,True,False,False

[h1] Target audience [/h1]

If you like tapping bricks in a casual game - look for another game.
If you like survival, realism and hard games - this game is a must-play.

[spoiler] And if by any chance you played ""Stranded 2"", and wanted a graphics upgrade - you found it! [/spoiler]

[h1] Full review [/h1]

[b] Graphics: 8 [/b]
Why: Decent textures, models, lights. Looks and feels pretty good for an indie game.
Why not 10: Doesn't have graphics of 2019 - no ray tracing support and other advanced techniques.

[b] Audio: 9 [/b]
Why: Sounds are realistic. Items, walking, jumping, environment sound pretty good. You'll feel like in jungle.
Why not 10: There are few (or almost no) soundtracks in the game.

[b] Gameplay: N/A [/b]
Why: Haven't finished it yet to know all the game mechanics and scenario. Will update after finishing.
Note: The game can sometimes be so addicting, that you may ignore the main mission and start building and living your own life in a beach.

[b] UI/UX: 7 [/b]
Why: Generally UI fits well into the theme.
Why not 10: Menus could be improved to be accessible easier. Not very intuitive to go to notebook to build buildings, traps, fire. Takes some (little) time to get used to.
Below is a personal opinion, which was not counted in the in the score.
Instead of 3 scales for fats, carbs, etc there could be 2 scales - Nutritions (call it anything), and Energy. In that case each food could give both - X nutritions and Y energy. 
That would make things a little bit easier to [i]track[/i]. Yet could be implemented in a way so that it did [i]not[/i] make the gameplay easier.

[b] Simulation: 10 [/b] 
Why: Get used to dying. There are plenty of ways to die, and they are all very realistic. 
Crafting and buildings are diverse. You could learn some real survival skills from the game, which may be useful in forests and jungles.
Why not 10: Well, what?

[h1] The Game [/h1]

Here are the first impressions from the game after 10 hours.
The main game starts [spoiler] after the wife gets lost. Checkpoint. [/spoiler]
Jumped off the cliff, as if it were GTA. Dead. Restarted from the last checkpoint. 
Jumped from few meters. Dead. Restart. 
Jumped from 1-2 meters. Got wounded (yes, alive!). Ignored it. Walked through jungles. The wound got infected from dirt. Got sick of it. Dead. Restart.
This time didn't try to test jumping. Oh, great, found a cave! Lets check it. Scorpion bites. Didn't notice it. It bites again. Poisoned. Seeing how life goes down, can't find leafs/mushrooms with antivenom properties. Dead. Restart.
Oh, lets build! Building a hut... Forgot about drinking water. Thirsty! Ocean water nearby. Argh, its too dirty! Got parasites. Ignored. Continued to build. Hut is almost ready, whooray! Lets eat banana... with dirty hands! Got more parasites. Thirsty, again! Drunk that bad water. Got lots of parasites. Got sick of it. Dead. Restart.
Lets do it right this time - food, building, water etc. Not wounded, got only few parasites, half on food - its okay. Lets explore the beautiful jungles! Nice! Heey I see lizard! Lets hunt it. Got it! Oh, got tired and sleepy. Hut is not nearby. Lets sleep in the jungle... under a heavy rain. Woke up. Had fever. Can't treat it. Dead. Restart.
Oh, and this is just the beginning. Haven't yet seen those tribes, big animals, fishes, snakes... which will kill me too!

Update: Yes, I've played 50+ hours, but haven't finished the main story yet. Why?
Imagine jungles, beach, sea... a palm tree on the beach, and a hut on top of it.
Now sit there and enjoy the beautiful view... when the sun is going down the sea...
Or look back and see jungles... a waterfall in front of you, with a rainbow above it, colorful flowers beneath it, and god-rays coming from the sun behind the tall trees...
Perhaps that's why they call it a ""deadly beautiful"" place!
Yes. I stopped the mission and started to build a complete settlement on one such place :)

Not trying out this again after finding out its still unfinished after 3 years.

Edit note: This is not the only thing i have about this game, personally i don't enjoy the story of this cuck of a character. 

But the game overall is unfinished, items are still unusable like it was 3 years ago, you still get the same bugs from 3 years ago where you get stuck on an invisible hitbox, the ui is still awful, you have graphical glitches with distant shadows and it still feels like an early access title from 3 years ago with a major update to the storyline (with a few items so you can build like in The Forest).",1703821805,1703822884,False,3,0,0.504210948944091797,2,True,False,False

You really have to pay attention, cause like if you eat while your hands are dirty it will give you parasites and stuff.  There are so many games out there that are like this, but this is the first one that I've found where you actually have to go in and fix your wounds and stuff rather than just take a pill that heals you or whatever.

Only played Story - pretty unforgiving but not in a ""git gud"" kind of way. There's a vicious cycle of having an infection, not having enough time/ability to find antibiotics or maggots, and then also not finding any dang bandage plants. Some areas seem completely devoid of them. Make sure you use multiple saves because if you save in a bad condition/spot, you may get very frustrated. I'm sure it'll be better down the line, but this is a pass from me for the time being.

REVISITED Dec 23, 2023
Well, I got attacked/killed by a jaguar 4 times in a row in the first village when I was trying to make the brew back-to-back-to-back-to-back. Still can't find the bandage plant anywhere. When you die it still reverts you to the last save, so that sucks. I am going to check out Custom Mode though... maybe the story is good?

FINAL REVIEW
Ok, story was kind of interesting. Had a feeling it was going that way. Definitely no point in base building or sticking around - push through the story. Feels like it could have been great like The Forest but fell flat.",1594347105,1703473458,False,2,0,0.538590610027313232,0,True,False,False

That being said, I do have one complaint. Currently, you can’t save your progress without exiting and going to the main menu. It’s a little frustrating when you have hours of work done, only to die and have to start back from when you last exited the game. It definitely need at least an auto-save function every few minutes, and a manual save option as well. I don’t like having to “Save and Quit” every so often, as it detracts from the gameplay. 

Otherwise? Amazing job, please support them! Well worth it!",1703456294,1703456294,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is pretty interesting. I built a few bases around the map in the story mode and a separate save in survival mode.

The Spirits of Amazonia mode isn't as optimized so the frame rates are far lower than the base story mode. Hopefully that is updated and fixed. The SoA mode also is a huge reputation grind with factions; not a bad way to whittle away of ton of time per se but with the stuttering performance I didn't feel like sticking around.

This is one of those games that I had wishlisted veeeeery early on. Never got into it even around its official release. I was always simply skeptical of it for some reason. You know how some of these survival games kind of FEEL similar and amateurish? I always figured this would be one of those. 

Well, at some point I saw that it was getting semi-regular, big-content updates. At this point the reviews were constantly positive, way more than before, and the updates just made people happier. So I got it and ended up completely blown away. The game feels great, it looks great, and the simulation is juuuust detailed enough to add variety and realistic needs that it doesn't bog you down completely, MOST of the time.

And since I got it, the updates have just kept rolling out. FREE updates. Seriously, the only ""DLC"" is the soundtrack. This game came out in 2019, folks. These devs have been committed to the game for well over 4 years and that alone deserves recognition. 

I tried building a home over some water and had a few issues. A few months later, an update came out that made building these water-involved bases waaaay easier.

The player movement is awful. Jumping takes stamina, and if you have none, you cannot walk over the 4 inch branch laying on the ground in front of you.

Enemy combat is clunky, unrealistic, and just has very poor quality animations. They do the same lunge animation before jumping backwards, 100% of the time.

The ground of the world is not smooth whatsoever. This means you will constantly be running into little rocks and debris that halt your characters movement. 

Collecting resources is slow and tedious. 

With every living thing in the game being pretty much able to kill you, you are constantly healing yourself from the poison dart frog, scorpion, snake, or spider you didn't see on the ground (probably because it was hidden under a bush or a rock). 

The harder difficulties do not make the game more ""difficult"", it just drastically increases the amount of food and water you need to survive. 

The story of the game is interesting, but once you have seen it once, it is very very boring. On the creation of a new save, you are FORCED to sit through the 5-10 minute long cut-scenes, with no skip option. For the first time you every play the game, it won't be that bad, but every save after makes you want to play the game less and less.",1703109668,1703109668,False,6,0,0.509584248065948486,0,True,False,False

In Green Hell, this is drinking dirty water which will cause parasite infections, or eating random plants that are toxic. Players will learn from their deaths, and never press those wrong sets of buttons again.

Green Hell provides plenty of foot guns like this and little guidance to its mechanics. This makes the first few hours frustrating to play. Once you figure that out (either by trial and error, OR reading the wiki), you are left with the ""correct"" way to play the game.

At this point, Green Hell's core game play starts to disappoint:

* The player has many needs, which needs to be satisfied. They are broken into 5 gauges - water, sugar, protein, fat, and energy. This seems complex initially, until you realize that 1) resources are extremely plentiful and everywhere, and 2) there are overpowered and unrealistic recipes (e.g. bone soup) that can cheaply fill several needs at once.
* The combat exists solely to have a combat. Hunting and fighting is one dimensional and trivial.
* Base building exists but isn't necessary, since resource needed for survival are plenty.
* Exploration is boring. Since the view distance is small due to heavy forage in the jungle, you are left with just following the GPS + Map. I lost interest in exploration because everywhere looks the same, and have the same resources.

This is a game that is hard to learn initially and easy to master. Once you realize that there is no long term goal, no challenge, and no joy in exploration (invisible spiders), the game quickly loses its appeal.",1702877942,1702878283,False,77,8,0.634852468967437744,4,True,False,False

the game is awesome in on itself but there is one flaw, it is very hostile towards new people in my opinion. 
I experienced quite a show when I loaded up the game, the graphics are awesome and there is definitely a huge potential in this game BUT there is one thing bugging me. This game doesn't support virtual reality, don't get me wrong it has support for virtual reality but you just have to buy the game again for some reason. I bought it with the intent to play it in vr to fully immerse myself into the shoes of a survivor but unfortunately they don't put the VR version into the original game. I don't know if you have to download the whole game again AND the VR as addition. 

To sum it up, overall a big plus from me and you should definitely give it a try but sadly this game doesn't include vr. 

To give you tips, just put the VR addition behind a DLC (Just kidding) Nobody likes micro transactions.

_____
Even though I do recommend this game, it is the worst game to build in, it needs work has needed work for the past 2 years. So make sure to get it on sale if anything. It doesn't feel right paying full price, because it feels incomplete

Building a base is so buggy that you could literally waste hours of your life trying to build a structure only to be denied placement of objects like mud walls, or frames unless they are placed in a specific order and not too many rows deep... there's other things like this that occur when trying to build that just make no sense at all, it is not a rewarding experience to spend hours chopping and gathering in order to set up the structure of your base only to be denied placement of walls. 

For a quick and cool experience to simulate survival, this game does the best job so far but I am keeping my eyes peeled for the next best thing everyday because of how frustrating building in this game is. It's been over 2 years that many people have complained and they still haven't fixed it, they have however added more content to the game and recently the ability to have pets and breed animals... which would be nice to have if you could build a huge base right? Nope instead you have to settle for structures that are unfinished or disproportionate that look as though they were designed by a moronic game developer... The quality of the game reflects its maker(s) after all, it is self evident and if that's what they've settled for I tell you: they've settled for making your building experience a shitty one.

Now there's many other things this game promises to deliver which I'm sure they fall short of, I am not so well experienced or aware of those things... like multiplayer for example. Be sure to look up what those things are, because there are surely other complaints people have about this game. Again, get it on sale if anything.

However after the new building update i decided to pick it up again and start fresh. I set all settings to easy as i just want a chill play through this time but still have to worry about dangers and enemies eventually. What i can't believe is that there is still no save option?? i made it to the first camp, gathered supplies made some tools, had just boiled water and had a real meal to eat. By this time it's late and i made a bed roll and slept for the night. I wake up eat, drink water, and im about to go craft a spear when a tiger shows up. Ok no big deal it's to be expected i guess. I manage to get a couple hits and it runs off. Cool. Immediately after two tribesman show up with spears and start attacking me. Im constantly blocking and manage to kill one and stab the other one at least six times yet he's still standing attacking me. I feel like one or two more hits and he's dead but by this time I've bled to death and died... Ok no big deal i think because i had just slept through the night so i figured there would be some auto save feature right? wrong. I start over at there very beginning when you first wake up... almost two hours of taking my time and gathering what i need and enjoying the game gone because there's no save or auto save feature. Yet there's a save and quit feature!? so you're telling me if i want to save my game i need to completely exit the game and come back in? That's dumb asf. I could understand on a higher difficulty but the lowest difficulty setting? Some of us have jobs and live's and kids and don't have the luxury of having hours of progress thrown away. Add a save feature and maybe i'll try again.

Edit: I remembered that in order to save you have to build a shelter however my review still stands. In my situation i just described it didn't make much sense to go through the trouble of building a shelter just to save it when i have a bedroll under a prefab building anyway still in the beginning. If there's a ""save and quit"" option and you're on the lowest difficulty there's no reason to not have a save at will feature.",1702162997,1702164196,False,2,1,0.497925341129302979,0,True,False,False

Everything about this game is basically designed to be annoying for a new player. They give you very little info about what anything is and it requires a lot of trial and error (or the inter-webs) to know what things do. Just save-scum so you can f around to find out.

And that's really the thing, once you ""know"" the game is pretty simple. For example, drinking dirty water becomes no problem when you know which mushrooms easily take care of parasites. My run with permadeath on only took a few hours, with the biggest threat of death being falling off a cliff. 

The story requires you to constantly move and unlock new areas, so building a base is a gigantic waste of time. And the worst part about it is building ANYTHING in this game is such a chore. On top of this, you need to build a shelter to save your game. Yikes.

The story was probably the best part. I liked the way it all came together, but the bad ending is so much better than the good ending.

TLDR: Solid 5/10, not horrible, not great. Good story. Crafting and base building is awful and useless (similar to The Forest). The survival stuff is only hard for the first few hours, then you just run around the jungle finding POIs.

Inventory management is okay but the building and crafting mechanics suck ass. Also, the buildings need lots of resources compare to what you can carry and gather in reasonable time making the fancy/big buildings pointless (just build what you need and keep going).
Using ropes/grappling hook etc was boringly done (lazy devs?) and the player just teleports up/down.
The sanity meter was bit weird and not sure what the purpose in the end was (increase the spookiness?). Also, the fats and carbs etc in the hunger levels are pointless and the hunger/thirst/sleep meters go unnecessary fast. Oh boy, and the sleep mechanism.. Once I was trying to go bed and the guy says something about getting sleepy and passes out on the bed...
The healing/medical mechanism was pretty good and not just drink/eat this and you get +X HP, but it was boring/annoying to remove leeches all the time.

Day 4 attacked by jaguar, died (This happened repeatedly during my quest for clean water.)
Day 17 attacked by jaguar and survived! I subsequently bled out before I could make bandages... Reloaded previous save and got attacked again, survived and got an infection. Died of said infection and then loaded back to a previous save with my infection, found some maggots and lived for 66 days during my first story play-through. 10/10 would do again.
Very realistic, sometimes glitches and/or bugs will show. Such as fires not cooking anything for some random reason. (I reloaded a previous save and it fixed the issue? So far never seen it again.) Building in this game is very fun, sometimes a little tedious as it can take a long time to run items back and forth but with the transportation update the sled is a life saver and quite inexpensive on resources and so would recommend building one or two as soon as you know where you want your base to be.
Some performance issues may arise but nothing really unplayable. Would recommend for anyone new to the survival genre and everyone who enjoys it.

9/10
(9/10 as I personally think that there should be a system to collect/harvest skins in order to tan hides when harvesting meat to use/make as items such as water skins and small bags to either add to carry weight, or more realistically, to carry small items in a ‘sack’ and add them to the sled as moving a large amount of small items between multiple bases would be easier with something like this, as it would lessen the amount of multiple travels allowing for more efficient time management, or maybe even use the skins as armour.

I played Green Hell a few years back around when it first came out and it was a genuinely fun game. Difficult, anxiety and paranoia inducing, and unforgiving in all the best ways. Now? I don't know what happened but the game is entirely unplayable because things happen with no rhyme or reason and each one will kill you on their own never mind when they happen back to back. In 10 days of in game time I was unable to so much as make it out of the starting area because every time I did I was either attacked by jaguars or hostile tribes. Not sometimes, not often, but every. Single. TIME. Every time I left that little starter area I would immediately take 2 lacerations which I couldn't get the right tools to treat because those herbs aren't in the starting area and then I would have infected wounds which absolutely tank your health and energy and I would end up passing out on my way back to my bed which was maybe a couple hundred meters away and because I slept without a bed I would contract 2-3 worms which require bandages to heal which I can't get because guess where those materials are? Not in the starting area.

It immediately became a cycle of ""I need X to treat Y but if I leave to get X then Y will happen but because Y happened I need X but if I leave to get it Y happens so I need X but if I leave...."" around and around until I die a stone's throw from the starting area.",1701220255,1701220255,False,2,0,0.501229465007781982,0,True,False,False

10/10 – For me it’s perfection, my best survival game ever.

It’s an incredibly good game! I see no downside of it, plus I can’t realize they GAVE Spirit of Amazonia for free! Honestly, it’s like a second game inside of the original game :D

This is a game where you'll have fun playing alone or with friends and it can be played multiple times because of the rich story line regarding Jake and Mia Higgins that just leaves players wanting to find out more. After completing the first play through, players can also choose to continue to play the epilogue to find out what happened to Jake and Mia prior to getting ""lost"" in the Amazon rain forest. The story line with the natives and the main character's development through both the first and second play through were very interesting to me and my friends which was the very reason that got us hooked into playing the game in the first place.
Even on the easiest difficulty, it still offers a ""survival mode"" where (yes, if you don't treat your wounds, cure poisonous bites, use protective armor for combat, etc. You WILL die.) Personally, I love survival games with realistic/semi-realistic punishments like this one where players can learn what to do and what not to do (i.e. eating poison dart frog meat whether it be cooked or uncooked, will make you lose your mind because of the poison, consuming human meat will significantly decrease your sanity).

Smaller details to note:
The developers really paid additional attention to the music (when in combat/hunting/relaxing) and the ambiance to make sure this game is as ""realistic"" and as exciting as possible. You never really know what to expect in this game as your camp can get raided, you can turn a corner and get stung by a stingray in the river, get jumped by big cats, etc. Compared to other games like The Forest, this game gives me more of an adrenaline rush and it just makes more sense to me realistically and logically; down to inventory space (even though I am not a fan of the weight limit).
When it comes to graphics, I'm a big fan of the realism - which this game does indeed meet my picky requirements (i.e. if it rains, the leaves ""look"" wet, the ground becomes slippery, the water is either clear or murky, etc).

Minor issues: Considering this game is about 4 years old already, there are bugs. Lots of them. Good and bad. It's not too bad to deal with while playing, though, some common ones that I wish could be fixed are:
-The natives glitch into the rocks or up the mountains when in combat.
-Natives' bodies start twerking on its own even after they are deceased (I find this one funny but sometimes the bodies just fly into the air or disappear completely).
-Chopping down palm leaves or trees to get long sticks may cause them to sometimes have a seizure (this is random, and yes they have a mind of their own).
**One of the bugs that I actually found to be annoying is anything regarding fish. Specifically Arowana. When you catch or collect an Arowana from a fish trap and you have no inventory space, the game automatically drops it which may cause it to be unavailable for pick up. The option to pick up the fish is just...not there sometimes.
Sometimes when picking up the Arowana fish, it will magically float out of your backpack when you open it, resulting in your backpack looking empty but you cannot place anything in the space that the fish is occupying nor can you grab the fish either because it just flies instantly every time you press Tab.

Overall, the game itself is still a blast to play and besides the minor bug issues, it's a really solid game.
My personal overall rating of this game would be a 9/10. I love the game design and its mechanics. Would definitely recommend.",1701167594,1701168004,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was waiting for them to fix the tribesman so combat was better but it seems its still missing something. combat is slow and to easy i can just arrow down anyone's face from 150yrds away and they don't even stand up to see what happen to there buddy. anything close and you just throw your spear at there face pointblank and its the same outcome. Game is to easy and it seems invisible enemies is how they make it harder? idk needs work. rope racks cool and all but yeah i need more.

Needed to add this. New Campaign: Why is ""Worthless Hands"" in the Amazon when he cant't even climb 3ft up? I mean literally can not climb without tools. The new campaign is really annoying due to this. the ""puzzles"" are liner and crude because of the no climb ability. the big boat is by far the worst thing this game has forced me to do. I feel this was constructed to make the game seem like its longer when really it just made it way more annoying.  Very boring and predictable i don't feel like i'm playing anything new.

Ok finally seeing some good things here. enemy combat has greatly improved! new buildings are ok. multiplayer is amazing now and no more invisible animals and enemies!

Right back in the red :(

That's right, every single hour has been spent exploring the vast depths of the jungle in sandbox mode. Green Hell has truly become my digital Eden, and here's why.

Customizable Difficulty:
Green Hell offers a level of customization that few survival games can match. Whether I'm tweaking the speed at which my nutrients deplete or adjusting the intensity of jungle threats, every playthrough feels uniquely challenging. From angry tribals to leeches, the game keeps me on my toes, and the ability to fine-tune the experience adds an extra layer of immersion.

Visual Splendor:
Even on my modest, low-spec PC, Green Hell is a visual feast. The game's stunning graphics manage to captivate, pulling me deeper into the heart of the Amazonian rainforest. The attention to detail, even on lower graphics settings, is commendable, making every exploration a breathtaking experience.

Solo or with Friends:
Whether braving the wilderness alone or teaming up with friends, Green Hell provides a dynamic and engaging multiplayer experience. The shared struggles and triumphs in this virtual jungle amplify the game's immersive qualities, and the cooperative play adds a new dimension to the survival narrative.

Crafting Complexity:
The crafting system in Green Hell is a masterpiece of complexity. Every item feels like a hard-earned achievement, and the game's emphasis on realism adds a sense of urgency to every crafting decision. From improvised tools to essential survival gear, the crafting system is as challenging as it is rewarding.

Versatile Building System:
Building my own base has been a highlight of my Green Hell journey. The versatility of the building system allows for complete customization, from the location and shape of my base to the materials used. It's not just a shelter; it's my sanctuary, reflecting my choices and strategies in the harsh jungle environment.

Devoted Developers:
I've eagerly anticipated and celebrated each new update from the developers. Their commitment to refining and expanding the game demonstrates a passion for delivering an ever-evolving and enriching experience. Green Hell feels alive, not just with the dangers of the jungle but also with the ongoing support from a dedicated development team.

In conclusion, Green Hell isn't just a game; it's an immersive, challenging, and visually stunning journey into the heart of survival. With 230 hours spent and countless more to come, I can't recommend this game enough to fellow adventurers seeking a truly remarkable survival experience.",1700923712,1700923712,True,59,6,0.769177496433258057,0,True,False,False

The lush, dense foliage, the realistic animal behavior, and the dynamic weather system all contribute to an immersive experience that feels like a virtual trek through the Amazon itself. The attention to detail is simply stunning, making it easy to forget you're in a game and not navigating through the actual jungle.

The challenging aspects of the game are a true testament to the developers' commitment to delivering an authentic survival experience. From crafting your own shelter to foraging for food and dealing with the constant threat of illness and injury, Green Hell demands strategic thinking and adaptability. The game doesn't hold your hand, and every decision you make has consequences, creating a sense of urgency and excitement that few games can match.

What sets Green Hell apart from other survival games is its exceptional multiplayer mode. Joining forces with friends in the unforgiving jungle adds an entirely new layer of enjoyment. Cooperation becomes crucial as you tackle the game's challenges together, sharing resources, expertise, and the thrill of overcoming obstacles as a team. The multiplayer aspect turns Green Hell into a social adventure, where the camaraderie forged in the heat of survival is as rewarding as the triumphs themselves.

Graphics- Pretty smooth, although enemy humans will glitch into a tree or boulder and still be able to attack you at range. Overall genuinely feels like a trek through the Amazon. 

Story- Surprising decent for a survival game and did not go into the direction I thought it would. Don't expect the ending to be life changing just enjoy the ride.

Gameplay- Fun, if unforgiving for the first few hours. Do NOT skip the tutorial. Enjoyed hunting food and scavenging for supplies as well as defending against enemies. Sanity plays a lot more in this then most survival games, so don't go crazy.

Sound- Soundtrack is awesome, very minimal during exploration (lets the natural sounds of the jungle do the work) and picks up good atmospheric tunes during hunting or fights. Give the main menu screen's track a listen in full, its a banger.

Co-op- This setting worked well enough, however my teammate and I couldn't understand the loading Saved Game system for a good while, as well as the re-spawn requirements. To save peeps time: Be sure to sleep and save game at the same location 'together' as often as possible. 

Building-Crafting the basics is very straightforward. Building shelters can be nit-picky due to needing to build foundations on a flat surface, not easy to find in the jungle in the middle of the night. The advance crafting (metal based tools and weapons) are a bit more  complex but don't really offer much for game progress and aren't necessary.

If you like to build stuff this is not it. But if you like the survival vibe this game is a must play.
Story mode took me 25 hours to clear first run on normal difficulty (WtTJ) BUT took me 2 hours for the second run on hardest (GreenHell) with good ending. A lot of stuff you can do but its optional really.

Overall 7/10   I like the story/lore and how they present it.
Combat 1/10  EVERYTHING combat related is JANKY AF (Enemies flying around doing goofy dance)
Building 2/10 Cannot turn off snap. Can't build half of the time because of terrain. *There's no floor* 
Crafting 5/10 There's very few QoL it's pretty bad
Optimization 8/10 there's no stuttering / crash in any of my session so it should be good stable fps

//Except the story I think everything else is worse than the forest.

This seems to be a survival focused not a mega base building or hoarding stuff.(But I did build one mega-base wasted 30hrs on that thing that should've taken like 10-15hrs in other games) They took more realistic approach to survival than most. Melee is super unreliable and sometimes you can get the game breaking bug when getting hit. Only thing you can do is save and reload so it's pretty bad. You get less of this if you wear armor but still get it if unlucky. So to avoid getting hit you just have to use ranged and oh boy it's OP. There's no enemy that can take 3 spears stuck in the head. Normal mobs only takes one. For me who loves to build super efficient and neat base this is like super duper bad so it was a major let down. There's no building you can invest your time in and it would payoff in the long run.(Modes of transport/cultivating/husbandry *they have the 2 latter one but it's a waste of time(Have 10+ farm plot and all it gave was a minute resources that took 5 mins of gathering to farm, husbandry you need to clean the pen and feed them food quite often so you can't go too far and the map is HUGH)) While combat and building is really bad I think what got me was the lore and some nice surviving mechanics. Leeches drain your sanity and it's frustrating to click them off every 5mins but you'll learn to manage your sanity and not walk through the bushes/water to get them. How they narrates the story is pretty nice also (these genre usually have weak story + telling in general). Many mechanics are intuitive so you don't have to search stuffs on internet. Don't know why someone would read this but thanks lol

A quick tips
-DON'T do ironwork/husbandry/plant cultivation
-USE the easiest(weaker) tools you can craft. I used just bamboo spear the whole game on every modes and it works just fine. The more you craft the tougher your tools will be. Usually weaker tools are lighter than more advanced one so the trade off is only damage. But you can one hit kill by headshot 7/10 times.
-Early crafted tools will break like paper but keep using the cheap stuff it'll get tougher!
-Obsidian Axe is pretty tough it's worth it if you're going to cut lots of tree. (obsidian respawn in caves)
-Bait archer for their arrows if you're to lazy to craft it.
-Boiled blue mushroom give 5 more energy.
-Lookout for piranhas in the water.
-Bone broth is a thing.",1700596256,1700597791,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In my current run (sandbox), I've passed the 200 day mark, & have yet to feel bored; & beyond that, there was a point in time when I realized that playing this game actually feels like surviving to me.  That seems like an obvious thing, but by comparison, other games have missed that mark for me.

The choice of game modes & customization options available are excellent, & the game runs very well for me, despite my playing on a laptop.  The models are well done, & there's a plentiful variety of flora & fauna to gather & hunt.  I especially appreciate the seasonal change, even though the game's setting limits it to two (rainy & dry).

I haven't been focusing on building too much, but I've seen screenshots of structures that amaze me.  So if building is your thing, you should also be covered.  ^^

tl;dr:  I highly recommend this game.  I have nothing but respect for these devs, & couldn't be happier that I (finally  ^^) purchased it.

Update:  I've now done more building, & found it to be somewhat buggy.  It hasn't detracted from my enjoyment of the game, but I thought it bore mentioning.

Update #2  ^^ :  The devs are in the process of adding free DLC, Spirits of Amazonia, which will be delivered in three parts, adding new maps & story segments.  Part one dropped about a week ago; I played the new map in sandbox, & am now playing the story, something I normally never do w/ survival games.  I'm having a blast, & even more convinced that CJ are among the best dev teams around.  ^^

Update #3  ^^:  And the devs just keep adding more goodness.  <3",1604471677,1700592563,True,54,2,0.831618845462799072,0,True,False,False

Immediately, [i]Green Hell[/i] presents itself as a janky Amazonian survival game. Death finds you at every turn, survival is a steep climb, the physics is untold nonsense, and the first thing you need to do is [i]craft[/i]. Green Hell reeks of the generic game that its dime-a-dozen tags suggest - and behaves the part, as well - but trudge through the challenge long enough and you'll find a well-crafted story.

Sure, the trifecta is all there. Green Hell employs an open-[i]ish[/i] world which you're free to explore. Shelter, cooking, healing, and hunting are all critical components. Crafting is required and done through experimentation and discovery. From the survival-crafting perspective, Green Hell isn't too special, but it breaks the mold by feeling like [i]Primitive Technology[/i], the video game. Shelters are a slog and require lots of gathering. Foraging and hunting are a game of trial-and-error, with your knowledge of plants and animals coming from eating or cooking them. You even need to maintain balanced macronutrients in addition to merely ""finding calories"". In addition, as you collect just enough resources to get by, the environment presents relentless and unpredictable challenges that keep you on your toes.

What genuinely impressed me was the story. I wasn't prepared for it at all, but it's integral to the game and [i]captivating[/i]. Green Hell tells a meaningful and topical story through the lens of an amnesiac re-discovering it himself. Whenever you think you understand what's going on, the game is quick to subvert your expectations. Those twists and the story's evolution give [i]Green Hell[/i] a profound depth that kept me hooked.

The developers have been very hard at work fixing everything for us with quick responses explanations, and they listen.. 
It is early access but is more than halfway finished now.

Well all I can add if you really love survival then this is one of the best.
However!  it still has learning curb and like any game without effort you may get hurt and die.
Green Hell works with Macro Elements setting it out from other survival.
Macro Elements= player must learn to how to manage  proteins Carbs Fats water. 
We now have 3 levels to choose from.
A Walk In the Park allows the player to experience survival with nature itself learn the skills and what native animals  / plants to watch out for. 

Then try the normal mode Welcome to the Jungle level where you will experience the whole game with tribes/ predators and sanity.
Keep both levels and switch between them.

This game is unlike any other survival game I have played , it takes some players time to realize the only goal is explore learn and survive against very real and lifelike predators.

If you have ever watched Lost or Naked and Afraid.
Build shelter find food and water craft your tools explore.. Watch out for spiders snakes but they give a warning sound when near by.
It's so addictive, failure is not option for many players who then get frustrated as the only way was to learn by their mistakes and start again.  
Save  manually often reload when you die, learn, move on and avoid. :)
Save is possible only when building a small shelter, or a roof.

There is no mods or quick fixes.
Use your compass and save .
Look at the great Steam /Youtube guides first !!!

If you experience any dizziness as  the FOV is very immersive, simply .
Press the tilt key for the frames to displayed.

I kept dying and having to start again because even staying alive long enough to build and save the game seemed intense. I got it figured out after great pain and found a very demanding survival game with an amazing story line.

The second part of the game SOA Spirits of Amazonia was by far a greater part of the game. I spent at least 2x completing this portion of the game. It was tougher and more involved. SOA required using many of the crafted products the main story line never incorporated. 

My few critiques - 
- Too many leeches. This should be reduced. I would prefer fewer events, but more pain/suffering from the leech bite. 
- Crafting and Fortifications -  I would like to need to build a more fortified base and defend it. There was no reason to build out a base. I never bothered with most of the crafting as it was not needed.",1699222631,1700071982,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I'm giving this a thumbs up because I spent hundreds of hours in it and I'll most likely spend some more, [b]BUT[/b] I recommend it with caveats. The most important one is: In multiplayer mode, you are going to have a baaaaad time. And I mean [b]bad[/b]. [u]Be mentally prepared to have your game ruined 50 hours into the game[/u] because something glitched and the save became unplayable. This is not just me being finicky, I'm talking about [b]game breaking bugs[/b] that will make progression impossible for at least one of the players and you will have to start a completely new game. 

That being said, let me be thorough on the rest:
 
The tutorial is not really a tutorial, it's more like an interactive prelude where the characters talk and the setting for the story is explained. It will tell you stuff like using WASD to move and pressing E to interact with objects, which is pointless for any game made in the last 15 years, but it won't tell you how to split a coconut in half to boil water to drink, which is something you'll need to do in the first minutes after the tutorial and what gets most players killed in their first run. 
That's just a detail that causes some minutes of annoyance at the start of the game, but it's a sign of how things are going to be from there on.
 
I really liked the approach of having nutrients instead of just ""eat and drink whatever"" like in many survival games. It's also fun to try and discover the effects of different things when you eat them or use them in different ways. I wish there were more ways of doing this, like combining meats and vegetables in a pot to have a more nutritious food, crushing plants in a bowl to make ointments, etc. 
This is a very needed feature, IMO, because nutrient depletion and energy exhaustion happen at a very fast rate. The realism of needing a balanced diet to stay healthy is met by the absurdity of needing a whole night of sleep two or three times a day. 
This could be offset if eating better foods made nutrient depletion slower or sleeping in a better bed made energy drain slower, for example.

The crafting is also pretty nice. I like that you don't need a ""crafting table"" of sorts like in so many other games, and discovering the different recipes is actually quite fun. Finding out how to craft different kinds of armour and weapons was game-changing and exciting. 
The bad side is that different tools and weapons are basically just skins for the same thing. The shitty bow you can make the first minute into the game has the same draw strength as the super nice shiny bow you can't even craft yourself. Same with arrows or axes. Having different stats for tools would make crafting a more strategic decision and not just a chore.
Regarding the variety of recipes for crafting, there are things that are trivial for anyone that's left out in the nature (and are even present as decorations in the game), but somehow beyond the character's skills. For example, making a basket weaving leaves. 
I think pretty much anyone has intuitively weaved leaves to make a tiny box while sitting and chatting at a camp or picnic. This concept, however, is foreign to Jake. 
Then again, we're talking about a guy that decided to wear shorts and t-shirt to go to a wild jungle where all sorts of poisonous animals and plants abound.

Which leads me to the next point: Interaction with threats. 
I get that if you step on a snake, it makes sense it will bite you in the leg. But how does it make sense that stepping on a spider wearing thick trekking boots also stings you on the leg? That's exactly how we kill spiders, by stepping on them! 
And how tf does a spider bite you through the armour? What are these spiders made of, that can pierce armour that otherwise stops spears and arrows?? 
Same with leeches. Leeches everywhere. All the time. Non stop. Carry a jar and sell them by the pound when you go back to civilisation because even if you wear armour, the leeches will somehow crawl under it. 
If at least they could be stored and used as bait for fishing, it'd be worth the hassle, but their only effect is making you stop for 10 seconds every three minutes to pull them off and carry on. 

Building is kinda nice, but I think it falls a bit flat. It's nothing innovative, it has a system similar to The Forest, so it's a proven formula that just works. But I think it's a bit weak because of design logic issues. 
For example: you can't snap blueprints together. You have to finish a building completely and then you can snap another blueprint to it, so if you want to plan something ahead and you're not sure if you're positioning the first piece correctly... good luck with that. 
Also the ratio of harvesting, carrying and usage of materials is made to be the most annoying combination possible. 
You need 13 leaves for a shelter? Too bad, the palms drop 10 to 12. And you can carry only 6.
This holds for all buildings. It seems to be made to exasperate the player and make everything as wasteful of time and resources as possible. It's not even a design made on the service of realism, it's only against the enjoyment of the player.
The other reason why building doesn't live up to its potential is that there are lots of buildings and furniture that can be built, which feels very exciting and inviting, but then you find that there's barely any place in the game where someone keen on base building can actually put all these resources to use and build something big, which leaves a bitter taste of disappointment. 
Other than that, the building system works ok if you're doing a more nomadic style and you have dozens of mini bases spread throughout the maps. Which I guess is the spirit of the game, but is not consistent with providing such a rich building catalogue. You feel all dressed up and with nowhere to go.

Regarding the story of the base game, it's ok too. It isn't anything mindblowing or that hasn't been done before. I think that before reaching the second map, we had already guessed the twists and ending of it. 
However, it is quite well carried and it has some mini-maps with novel-like interactive cut scenes that show you parts of it which are very nicely done and quite dramatic. So kudos on a good execution of an otherwise average or slightly above average script. 

The story of the expansion, however... Feels like a different game. There's barely any story at all. It's just grind-grind-grind-grind ad nauseam. And it's not even MMORPG kind of grinding, where you feel determined to grind as long as it takes to get [b]The[/b] weapon you need, no no. Here it's ""you are blocked from progressing"" until you do this boring task over and over and over again for 10 hours. All while stopping every 2-3 minutes to pull leeches out of your legs. 
Exploring the same maps but with different features in them is nice, though. Gives a feeling of time passing and the dynamism of a jungle ecosystem. The addition of new maps is great too. 
Some of the locations are just beautiful. I have stopped more than once to just look around and appreciate the scenery. The rain, the fog, the parrots flying by, the sunlight piercing in beams through the foliage... just beautiful. 

All in all, it's a game I'd recommend buying if you can get it with a hefty discount. Otherwise you'll feel you paid to get frustrated.
I know this game was created by an initially small team, but Creepy Jar is no indie garage studio anymore and the game is in current development, so there's no excuse for having such big amount of game-breaking bugs that have been reported since day one still unresolved, or not having animations for many interactions, making it look like an alpha release instead of the 5 year old game it is. If at least the modding was more flexible, I'd be happy to sit down and put some hours into coding to fix the many clipping bugs with a mod, but that's not possible.

Steam needs more options when it comes to refunding games that aren't what I expected. 2 hours is not enough to figure out some games if they are worth keeping and playing. 

Aside from that, this game wants to be realistic, but it's not. It's too simple, like the forest only a bit more details.

I put a ""killer trap"" near my base. I catch 10 pigs a day with this trap. They don't even walk into the trap. They just appear out of nowhere. You turn your back on the trap and 1 second later there is a pig inside it again.

The sanity goes down too fast, you constantly are picking off leeches form yourself, even with armour and such on. So it breaks the fun when every couple minutes you need to peel leeches off your body. It's tedious and putting your stuff back on is a pain in the rear.

You get tired as soon as you leave your camp for a few minutes, even with full food bars. We had to turn Tiredness off, it just was too much when you want to explore and gather things. If you already slept all night and full of food, hydrated, in morning why are you tired before noon breaks? Makes absolutely no sense at all.

I waited years to get this game because I figured it was just another ""forest"" clone. It kinda is. Same feels, same graphics, UI looks almost identical.

Oh and the tribes are lame as well. Couldn't really get into this game, maybe it's good for kids.
But if you played games like Dayz and so on, then this is really childs play.

Oh and the story mode is cringe. They spent more time yapping and wasting time than actually learning how to play in the tutorial. Had to quit that.

3/10.

Green Hell is a punishingly difficult survival game. But it rewards your persistence by creating a very effective learning curve. When my husband and I started playing, we were dying left and right, gaining negative conditions stacking on top of each other. Run from a hostile native only to step on a snake. Try to eat a healing mushroom only to get parasites because you were dirty. Start running back to base, but fever makes your fatigue plummet so you fall asleep on the jungle floor and get a worm. Nightmares on top of nightmares.

But as you play the game you slowly learn how to navigate the dense jungle safely. You learn what treatments work on which kind of ailment (I wrote them on cue cards I keep on my desk). You learn what supplies to carry and what you can forage as you travel. You craft armour and tools with better and better durability.

Now after beating the base game, and halfway through the Spirits of the Amazonia expansion we are lean, mean, jungle survival experts. My husband is diligently building a massive multi-story tree house to keep our supplies safe from the natives. He has identified the paths they take to attack us and lined it with traps. I'm off on long trips across the map finishing tasks and searching for iron. Building temporary shelters, landing head-shots with my bow, and surviving off the land. I really, truly feel like I have levelled up my skills despite the levelling aspects of the game being very minor. We've transitioned from victims of this jungle to masters of it.

This is a survival game like no other. Realistic and brutal, but fun and satisfying.

My one criticism is that it seems poorly optimised. Even on a decent gaming PC I have to lower the graphics settings (though the game remains beautiful), and it's worse on multiplayer. Luckily the game is too fun for this to stop us.

I would have liked a different way to review on this one. I want to be clear that the quality of this game is excellent. The sandbox element is enjoyable. It's limited when compared to other games, but I'd still recommend it. The story element is what failed for me.

It's well executed, but it feels like a horror rip-off Medicine Man. It's probably not fair to call it a rip-off though as there are some quite creative elements that make a unique narrative. The story is grim and the ending is hopeless even with the ""good ending"". I don't mind a bad ending due to bad choices or a bad ending where narrative is humorously absurd or unreal. The MC is a tortured anti-hero and every major choice he makes is irrational for any modern anthropologist. I realized early in the story that [spoiler] the MC was the cause and played on looking for a redemption arc that never came. [/spoiler]

I know this is a personal preference, but I suspect this is shared among players who game to relieve the normal stresses of life. If I could go back, I would choose not to have played the story.

The game is known for difficulty, but that is mostly centred in a brutal learning curve. It all seems very intricate, but the challenge is in the lack of knowledge. It's interesting having to learn by trial and error what you can eat, but there's remarkably little that's actually dangerous, and once you get past the first couple of days food is no longer an issue. There's not even similar looking items which are either dangerous or not. The pattern is too simple. The game has its maladies, which is interesting, but most are easy to deal with. There's a whole water purification aspect, but parasites are too easy to just deal with. Otherwise the game relies on somewhat cheap difficulty by simply having near lethal hazards dotted around. It's challenging in the same way crossing a minefield is challenging. Also once you figure out how to make armour, random big cat attacks are an inconvenience, not a threat. Also development is, dissapointing. The game doesn't seem to intend player settle down and get comfy, and there's no point. You can make better tools, strive for metal... but there's no point. Even the deadliest threats or sturdiest prey fall to a headshot, and neither is too good at evading them. In short, lots of interesting ideas, which feel shallow in implementation once you get a few hours in.
Also the less said about the story mode the better. It starts strong with intrigue and surprises, but it doesn't last. It does use foreshadowing well, and the twists between the two main characters is good, I'll give them that. The dialogue between them is often quite good, layered with the right amount of... not quite right. I'd avoid spoilers, but the story mode doesn't deserve it. In short, it leans on the trope of tribal medicine being better than the combined knowledge of the globe, to the point of being a literal miracle cure panacea. But for some reason, some part of it is presumably missing, which causes a virus? Or prevents the panacea working on a virus? Neither is clearly put forward, and neither make sense. If it was a side effect of the medicine, it wouldn't be viral, and the supposedly immaculate health of this miracle tribe precludes the latter. The whole story loses touch with reality going into the second region which makes its determined attempt to layer blame on the player character, strange. There's also some slightly amusing... comments on quarantine that aged like milk, but to be fair the story mode was released pre-covid, so it couldn't know people were going to have a frame of reference to compare their narrative holes to.
Still curious to play it? I'd recommend with friends, and survival mode. The early game really is reasonably fun and wild. But the dangers falls off quick, ""better"" tools aren't worth the time, and your own personal stories will be better than the one they made.",1698598587,1698598587,False,39,2,0.716434895992279053,0,True,False,False

Since then, I've been playing on multiplayer, which had a totally different death / respawn mechanic that make the game hit way better. If you can maintain on the front side of the power curve on this game, it's rewarding if a bit laborious (and I keep coming back to that word), but not necessarily in a bad way. The mechanics keep you from just shutting off and hitting trees, if that's what you're looking for, but the exploration combined with building, gathering, hunger and stat management, and hostile threats keeps things pretty lively. It's a good game but definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea. 


I see what they're doing here, but the result is just save scumming over and over again, having natives cheap-shot one hit you without warning, and finally, an infection that didn't appear on my arms or legs at all, with no status icon. Neat idea, but the gameplay loop is particularly laborious, and the amount of random deaths and reloads made the experience just not fun. It's a great concept, and the implementation is kinda there, but it's mostly just a frustrating loop of reloads and saving every few seconds to prevent having to do the same tedious tasks over and over again. after a few dozen hours of gameplay, my character is only a few hours old, and not in an enjoyable way.",1698305768,1698439673,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Green Hell is such a special survival game, that deserves all the love it already gets. It beats games like Sons of the Forest in my opinion easily.
Learning the game, even with the Tutorial, including curing all my diseases was a pain the ass. The crafting mechanics are so individual as in no other game.
The graphics are absolutely stunning, the gameplay super realistic. Apparently if you climb up a roof with leaves, it would even collapse. I mean frl, how realistic is this? If I were to make a Game, I would've never thought of such small details. The Story I have yet to continue, but so far I freaking love it. The animations are also something that just has to be called out, they're amazing.

When it comes to Multiplayer, my mate keeps teleporting around, some tribesman in the wall, but nothing really gamebreaking.

In an attempt to give an ""authentic jungle survival"" experience, Green Hell makes you fight with the interface every step of the way. You want to pull the meat off of that fish so that you can cook it? Hope you have extremely high precision with your mouse. You wanna cook that fish meat? No, you're gonna throw it on the ground instead! Wanna build a structure? Open your notebook, guess which sub-category the thing you want is in (which are navigated only with icons across all the various edges of the pages, so you are constantly weaving back and forth to change categories), then flip through page after page after page until you discover that it's not in that entry so now you have to hunt for the next tab to find the thing. Oh it's not there either! Guess you better start over... except you just died of hunger because time is still passing.

Creatures and hazards that range from nuisances to deadly are sometimes invisible, so you can stumble into things that kill you without any warning. You must manage multiple types of nutrition, which of course will sometimes not spawn at all, making it impossible to do anything about debilitating hunger. Some items are crafted by using a recipe from a notebook, others by opening your crafting radial menu and selecting from your pack, still others by picking up something large and then right-clicking and selecting ""Craft"" from the item, so you never know what you need to do to build something.

Level design includes visual tells to help guide you when you spot an important place, such as the use of color, signage, and shape to direct you—but often only when you get right to the spot; you have to weave aimlessly through the jungle like a drunken anaconda to find anything.

Categories of items that you use are often nonsensical; if you are building something out of sticks, you can't also throw in some bamboo sticks. Those are two different things and the game Will! Not! Allow it! Instead you must make a SPECIAL bamboo thing.

No ability to craft simple items that would be useful to you: You can't use bamboo to make a tube for carrying water, you can't use a stick to make a trail marker to help you navigate and put a marker on your map with charcoal, you can't even use a pair of banana leaves to pick up a poisonous frog safely.

Even little things like press C and ""inspect your body"" there was no such thing on the menu. There was a magnifying glass lol, but this doesn't mean ""inspect your body"". It just says inspect. Please be more clear and concise with your menu, or better get rid of the wheel and use shortcuts instead. The user interface to access and craft things felt incredibly counter-intuitive and leaves much room for improvement. As for the game play: We went for 'welcome to the jungle' (assuming this is the normal level). Day 1: leeches and parasites, that's fine, but day 2 already a tiger and a cannibal when we're already struggling with the awful user interface and then loosing all the tools and weapons when you do die?

Do I recommend it? I don't know. 

tl;dr - Game is unbalanced. Threats do not equate to time in to deal with them in meaningful or fulfilling way. In addition to not having an efficient or sure way to do so. Which is the majority of the game. 

I know of only a few friends that might play this, at all. Let alone long enough to not get a refund. 
This game has severe balancing issues. You will spend the majority of the game playing doctor to your self. If you save scrub constantly, and never stop gathering resources you might be fine. 

There's a load of people to sing this games praises and that's okay, there's a lot to like.

My issue with the game, put as simply as I can. 

Injury -> Find resource to heal -> Found -> Craft -> Healing -> Healing doesn't work because some dirt got on wound even after applying correct healing method, its now infected -> Find cure for infection -> Starving and need rest -> Search for food -> Find food, about to pass out. If you pass out, that equates to more injuries that might get infected -> Rest -> Nearly dead from infection and hungry again -> Prioritize finding healing as you are near death -> Move slower, lack of stamina from starving, search for healing takes longer -> Find proper healing resources -> Craft/heal -> Wound is no longer infected but you are out of proper healing resources but still have an open wound and still starving -> Look for food -> Verge of passing out and no choice but to use immediate options -> Find floor bird -> Try to make fire -> Not enough stamina -> Sleep -> Health has regenerated slightly, but not enough due to lack of food -> Build fire -> Cook food -> Eat food -> Can move freely now with some stamina for sprinting -> Wound is infected again. 

Does that seem like a lot to you? This is the issue with the game. Its the above, over, and over, and over again. A single injury can cause you to endlessly spiral into the game being completely ruined and needing to start over. The above is a common, but LUCKY scenario where you end up -as bad as you started- because the game has no god damned chill when it comes to being anything resembling balanced. Its like a snake eating its own tail, everything you do with cost you and you're running at full speed to stay in the same place, but the game disallows you to run fast enough and you inevitably end up in a death spiral. 

The only way to prevent this is 
1. Save scrubbing. Save literally every few minutes. 
2. When you're in any kind of bind, basically you better already have a base and lots of resources or you're done for. The actual thing you're supposed to do in this game if injured is nothing. Heal your self and not do anything. If you harvest any food while healing you could be infected. So there's a lot of actual waiting around. Which to the character you're playing is exhausting. 

Its frustrating. Even when you know what you're doing. Not even mentioning the random puma attacks. 

Lastly. Carrying literally anything. You need a ton of resources to survive. 
You can make item boxes, but many items cannot go into the box, for some reason. 

So it makes sense to just, take it with you. 

However. Imagine playing Resident Evil 4, and having one herb take up 1/5 of your item space. That sound good? I know it doesn't. The backpack system is atrocious. You have a limited amount of actual space to use, with makes some sense on its face. But, NOT when some LEAVES take up nearly your entire allotted pockets for things you NEED but cant eat. I cannot do it justice. It might be the worst item system I've ever seen. It does not align with the relative polish of the rest of the game.

That's only the first issue I have. The second is nearly worse. The maximum weight you can carry without being dramatically slowed down, is less then my single arm bicep curl. This dude, this intrepid survivor, killer of crocs and scourge of man killing cats, cannot carry 50lbs without needing to walk like he's on his way to the retirement home. 
Wait. Maybe this all makes sense in some strange way. Like the main character is actually a below average guy with no immune system, though I don't think that's the case. 

All that, and I have little respect for devs that seem to be anti player, but that's a different bag of worms. The game overall is pretty good. Graphics, sound design, voice work, and general game play are all fairly good. But it needs work still, and I feel like the devs aren't reeaallly going to change much at this point.

I've even had to pick leeches off of my character! Which brings me to another point, sanity. If you don't take care of your health, (in the four different aspects along with your physical check ups) you'll start losing your mind.

The game itself is amazing. Great graphics, great story line (from the little I've seen), and very immersive gaming environment. Every action has a consequence. And I mean EVERY action, and even lack of action, has a consequence. I'm just not cut out for all of the survival scenarios- despite thinking I would be. Even the easiest setting is a bit over my head. I'd recommend this game if you have a lot of patience and think that slower and realistic survival games are therapeutic.

Jokes aside, this survival game is harder than hard. The smallest slip can result in fatal injuries. My guy fell 5ft, got a scratch, which got infected, and died from fever/dehydration/major organ failure. No idea why he even tries to leave the house with how fragile he is, much less venture into the brutal Amazonian jungle where everything with a pulse wants to sign your obituary.

Still, once you get the hang of surviving past your first 15 minutes, things start to get better. There's building, (a bit of) farming, cooking, hunting, fishing, killing tribals, eating them, etc, etc. All of that, while maintaining your macronutrients, something you never did irl... wasn't this praised for being realistic??

If you ever want to feel the stress of metaphorically straightening a crumpled, wet tissue paper without tearing it, try this game.

The aesthetic is interesting.  The game has neat mechanics: rather than a simple health/status bar, you have to examine yourself for injuries and treat injuries of different types in different ways.  The inventory management is a bit clunky, but in ways that are quasi-realistic for the stranded-in-a-jungle setting.  You have to eat a balanced diet to remain at full strength, which means you can't just harvest or farm a single food.

But the game is unplayable in multiplayer due to what appear to be synchronization bugs.  I hosted and didn't have problems.  My partner joined and played with few incidents in the first session.  In our second session, however, it seemed that about half of the items that she picked up in the world or moved between inventory containers (backpack, storage box, etc.) would disappear.  In a crafting/survival game, this is brutal: cooked meat, plants that cure ailments, etc. went missing.  It's hard to play a survival game if you can't eat the food you pick up (because it vanishes).

It goes much harder into the survival than the crafting angle, with the primary focus most of the time simply being staying alive.  That means finding food and shelter and keeping your (multiple) health gauges topped off.  But this is hard, as the game has a very minimal tutorial and just throws you into things with the danger level at 100%.

You'll stumble around blindly, get bitten by a snake, stung by wasps, swarmed by leeches, drink water infested by parasites, eat poisoned mushrooms, then mauled by a jaguar.  In the beginning it's not really an enjoyable experience.  You'll have status ailments attached to you and have no idea how to get rid of them.

With knowledge you can mitigate every threat to your person, or better, avoid them instead.  By the end of the game you will demolish the hostile naked stick wielding natives in your metal armor, 360 no scope that jaguar in the head with your bow, gut it for meat, then bring it back to your luxurious base with a bed made of leaves, meat smoker (aka a bunch of sticks tied together), and storage crates made of mud.

The story of the game is the high point.  It starts off sort of vague but gets a lot better the further you go and as your discover more things.  I'm extremely partial to the bad ending.

Cutting down trees and such will sometimes have logs flying around, the game sort of tries to predictively put food in your path but can often be missed when it spawns falling fruits/nuts behind foliage you couldn't possibly see, things can spawn clipped into terrain and become unaccessible, and so on.

All in all a fairly good experience.",1696728214,1696728214,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love this game but the 2 things that ruin the game the most for me are things like long sticks and logs glitching through the ground, and the most annoying is performance i don't have a good computer but it can run most games well but green hell i'm always at 10 fps even on the lowest settings and the update seemed to lower it even more, please make it run smoother and this will be one of my favorite games. thank you CreepyJar and keep up the good work! have a great day.

Got to the point where without much spoilers, you had to use the climbing equipment the game soft locked itself after saving on python island. My friend was the host and he saved the game but there was a caiman nearby yet he was able to save ( by right this should not happen when there are enemy combatants around ). In the end he froze there and the caiman attacked him yet he was not dead. He restarted and he respawned out of bounds in the game. A place where you could see half the map was missing. And when i joined back the game i was back to square one. That is 10 hours worth of effort gone. This game is buggy as hell and i don't know how it made it out of early access. 

Another thing to add but unrelated to the bugs is why does the blood effects look like pastel color. It literally looks like pink water and the effect is so bland and minimal it doesn't make it feel realistic, which I assume is what the game is trying to go for. Just for that reason the game should be given a Teen rating if not for the amount of cuss words included.",1696702556,1696702556,False,1,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Choosen   Game world emptyness  +  travel speed  +  rate of decline of stats like energy and hunger  + speed of day/night cycle  =>  grindy and boing what could have been balanced to engaging and addictive.

The Good: 
Lots of possibilities when it comes to making your own base and it's easy to get immersed in this Green Hell.
I love the concept of trying to survive in the jungle.

The Bad:
The controls are pretty terrible and took some getting used to. 
The map in survival mode is small and there are currently only two - they both either could be larger, or there should be more open world maps available in survival mode. 
The character swearing is very repetitive, there should be an option to turn this off because this really is a cool game for my kid to watch as well.
More animals - if you're going to put monkey sound effects in the ambient environment of the map, then put monkeys in your game.

Overall:
All in all this game is still being regularly developed and it has a promising and frequently updated system with lots of possibilities. I think this game is worth trying and getting into.

1: The game is fun
2: The map is huge
3: Base building is fun
4: The story is good
5: Survival is realistic

Cons:

1: Stamina- Jake has the stamina of an asthmatic chain smoker. He can barely run 100m without losing his breath
2: Planks- It is highly unrealistic that one log only gives one plank. You could easily get between 4-6 planks per log.
3: Jake gets stuck on everything- If you walk over a log or rock you will get stuck and cannot move.
4: Jake does not jump properly- If you pres w and jump over something, you will jump backwards
5: Disappearing items- If you chop down a tree there is a high chance your items will fall through the map. Over the years on console and PC I have probably lost more than 200 logs and long sticks due to this.
6: Broken drops- If you carry logs or long sticks or bamboo and drop them, the game will drop the items but you will still be in the carrying animation so you have to open your inventory to fix it.
7: Sled is broken- If you let go of the sled there is a chance the sled will let go but will still be ""attached"" to your body and you cannot get rid of it. The only way to get rid of it is to either break it or reload the save.
8: There is no console commands- I like to build massive mega bases and it takes way to long to gather all the resources to build it. The debug console was removes for some reason. Whenever I beat games I like to mess around and spawn stuff in. Bring back debug mode
9: No creative mode- It will be extremely fun to have a proper creative mode where you can customise the seasons, enemies that spawn, instant build, no build restrictions and so on
10: Wet season is too short
11: Natives are too annoying- You cant smelt one piece of ore without natives spawning inside your base
12: Jake takes too much fall damage- If you fall off a slight hill you take damage
13: Crashes- Although rare, the game does crash for no reason
14: Building in water- Building in water is the biggest pain in the ass. I have my cursor on the build but it says 'Drink water' and not build.
15: Building- I have my cursor on the build but it refuses to build or one atom of another build is on the build so it ""blocks"" me from completing the build
16: Picking up stuff- I have my cursor on something I want to pick up but it either wont let me pick it up or it picks up something else I am not looking at
17: Inventory- If you sort or move items then they will disappear. They are still there but become invisible. Reopening the inventory makes them visible again.

I will add more to this list if I find anything else

The game can be enjoyable when there are no bugs. Bugs are so common that it ruins the experience. The game is still worth buying but be prepared for a ton of bugs and glitches.

This is the most accurate survival game I've played to date(to the point that it can be annoying). It took me about 2 hours to understand what all the little icons meant and what fixes them but once you figure that out it becomes much more fun. The story is pretty baffling and you take a ton of drugs to figure it out, so that's neat. Base building isn't that important unfortunately and all you really need is just a ton of little save houses here and there. Its about a 20-30 hour game story wise and pretty unique in a lot ways, so if you enjoy survival games its a must.

P.S. Rattlesnakes are the most annoying enemy (use tobacco to cure the venom)

(9/22/23)
Updating my review a bit now that I've played the SoA part of the game. The original story mode is better but SoA has some new neat mechanics. The problem is that it uses those mechanics over and over and over again to the point you are just checking boxes. The original story feels like a story with survival aspects where SoA feels like a survival with some sprinkles of story. 

Don't get me wrong, the survival aspect of this game is awesome but the story in SoA was a bit too slow paced imo. SoA took me 50+ hours to complete compared to the ~20 of the original story. So yes there is more content there but unfortunately it's a lot of the same. You have to cross the map a decent amount for objectives but at the same time it penalizes you for running. I know it's supposed to be realistic but I wish it was done in a less tedious way.

TL;DR, the original story is awesome and I'd definitely recommend it. As for SoA, I'd only recommend playing it if you really really enjoy the survival part of the game as it can get a bit tedious.

P.S. Rattlesnakes are still annoying but scorpions are are also the worst (eat the white and green lily leaf plant to fix the venom/poison stuff)",1575768339,1695449641,True,2,0,0.529411792755126953,0,True,False,False

Usually we had great fun even with stupid old games.
We were having a blast with The Forest even though I am a pu**y that get scared easily.

The experience with Green Hell is... just boring. 
I didn't know what went wrong. We just played for a while and feeling a bit too bored.
It could be because we spend ages to fetch materials but the only thing waiting for us is long hours of walk and snake bites? Maybe the gameloop is not rewarding enough.
The natives are more annoying than dangerous.

I wish we could get the same feeling of reward in fortifying and defending as in The Forest or Valheim.
I want to like GreenHell but somehow it just feel lacking. It's just my feeling.

Day 3: Woke up, ate and drank to go out and look at a trap I had set up 50 meters from the camp. Got mauled by a Leopard but killed it. Couldnt find the plant to make bandages. Died from my wounds next to my campfire.

Performance is not so great unless, you've dumped $1,000 into a good video card, and the same for a new CPU. I've managed to maintain a 34 fps max in game so, I'm OK with that for now. 

Being in a tropical climate, it rains a lot. When time to sleep, be sure you have a belly full of food and drink a gallon of water, in spite of the parasites it contains or, you'll die. If not, you wake up starving to death anyway and will die if you can't find a bushel basket full of some sort of unknown mushroom to eat. Then there's the parasites, again. Every five minutes, you have to stop and take a breath, eat, find something to drink or, that frkn watch beeps until you do. As for the character, movement is like some whimpy little boy that's always had mommy doing everything for him. Carry me mommy, I'm tired. Chop a tree, 3-5 hits he's wore slap out, needs to take a break and a nap. Come upon a log in your path, try to jump over it, it's like trying to scale the Empire State Building as if, it were some great effort to clear 12 inches of ground. Craft a hatchet with a stick and a stone, when it breaks, the character acts out as if that was supposed to be made out of cold-rolled steel and wasn't supposed to happen. If I could ever stop picking leeches off of me, I might get something done. Be sure to save your game every 5 minutes of progress. Have managed to survive 9 days now, no deaths and this is in Walk in the Park mode. 


On another note, be careful what you post, the developer is ban happy. 
Got a 30 day ban without a warning for telling someone they were ignorant. Steam rules are a warning, x3. Evidently, the developer doesn't like corrective criticism about his game, either. Reminds me of other fly-by-night developers. When they start banning people first off, they can always expect a negative review, especially from me. Take my money but, I can't have my say. However, with all this bullsh!t digital online purchasing, they can get away with it, more-so, by hiding behind the Internet & Steam.",1572627413,1694693358,True,2,0,0.529356718063354492,0,True,False,False

If you build walls on ground level, animals and tribal guys can walk straight through like they don't even exist making all the effort that went into building them pointless. 
If you build spikes along the wall, they will do one of two things- path to a spot like a shut door where you don't have spikes and just walk through there or destroy any structures you have outside of the walls (like mud brick crafters) and then proceed to walk through the shut door.

The authors tried to incorporate the dangers of living in a jungle with many minor survival options. These are well thought of.

The irritating part of this game is Crafting even minor elements. Though it was supposed to be a fun game crafting, but in turn its the most irritating and painful part of the game.
- The MAP function is real bad with nothing but just an image. I know that you are trying to put the reality into play, but its really a pain in the a**.
- half of the game is just made to gather stuff and to tend to our injuries, as the inventory size is quite small, cant put logs, big-sticks or leafs in the backpack.
- To construct a house with 5 platforms, i be required to run about carrying single items to the location it took almost 2-3 days(in game) to craft a mini house.
- This game seems to of survival, but in the current context, its irritating.
- cant even carry a stone - as it was named big stone but its a size less than a football. Cant even put it in the inventory. I wanted to play it like a game not like me actually going into a Amazon rain forest.
- As of now, the game is not at all in a playable state.

(for those who wish to enjoy crafting in s Single player scenario);
-After getting fedup with the game mechanics, i though of using some cheats/debugs in single player. But the debug mode has been removed. And cheats wont function properly at all.

Overall, i assume that this game will be helpful for those who want to train virtually so that they can plan  trip to any rain forest . 
For any other people who would to just do hours of gathering, improper crafting just to keep saving your character and not able to enjoy the story line, this might be for you.
If anyone who doesn't fall under these categories, I bet this game isn't for you, Try Icarus, Valheim, SCUM, ARK etc, which have betterr mechanics than this one, although most of the fetures could be nearly same, but  not this one.",1694616442,1694616442,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wholeheartedly recommend Green Hell if you have a penchant for realistic survival games. In my opinion, it stands as one of the best in its genre to date. Although, I have to admit, those pesky snakes lurking around every corner seem determined to make my life miserable.

If you're into this sort of challenging gameplay, Green Hell is a must-try. It'll test your limits in various situations, and you might even have to endure a few deaths to get things right. However, the sense of accomplishment in the end is truly worth it.

Thankfully, the Developers whom I once upon a time was fortunate enough to speak with, are actively updating the game with new and improved content!

On my rating scale, Green Hell earns a solid 9.5/10. It's the kind of game where you can get killed by a snake, respawn, and get killed by it again – it's an adventure that leaves you with lasting memories.

I haven't played through the story yet (I died alot but don't take it as a negative thing in this review) but the overall survival and building part is pretty realistic. When I played today multiplayer with a friend, for some odd reason I found I have gained alot of new achievements that I don't know anything about. Helping Tribe women, fishermen and children? I didn't even know I could meet any without being killed and so haven't seen any unless my sanity has been 0 for awhile I died due to a tribe member coming from behind and killing me with a spear or another weapon in story mode. The game is good, I'm just wondering what happend about the achievements.

Edit: Seems like this achievement thing happend to my friend too when joining the multiplayer and we gained the same achievements (But we didn't do anything related to the achievements, except the very first few achievements that he got during the tutorial and most likely around one or two for making his first tool and you know.). We just tried to build two frames and ran out of stones to break wood for tools and equipment.. We went to search for some and meanwhile he said they found a predator (maybe he meant a jaguar or I don't know if there is any tigers. Because what he told me directly was ""I found a cat"") that they started punching and ran to me (telling me something about the predator doing some kind of sound and backing away). He said he's bleeding and going to die and dropped all the things before they died (even if I'm not sure if the items would've really disappeard or will these be near their dead body or something like that.) After he respawned, we didn't find each other and he suggested to make a new game. He hosted his own game, server or lobby and we just gathered a bit of resources and they saved the game for us to play it later. Also in the first one he were running around in the forest a few times and were probably hitting things but when he dropped their resources before he died I saw some things that I didn't know he had. Just a side note of thinking what may triggered the bug. Sorry if I made it too long. The achievements are: Cage Opener, Cleaning Volunteer, Rest in peace, Fishing in troubled waters, Molineria-man, Babysitter. I know, who would complain about getting achievements? It just seems a bit weird, you know. Like something isn't working correctly and isn't supposed to do so. The comments are open, say what you think.

the problem.....

the entire game is still built on a story arc game play. the building aspects are just poorly glued on like child stickers. so you have a game with a huge map....in which the build aspect only really applies to the first 1/10th of the entire map. the rest is a meaningless waste of time. and its a shame because this would have been so much more awesome if the map had been properly overhauled for the building update.

And the AI in this game is really dumb as hell, they often stuck in one spot or wall climbing like it's Skyrim, I really don't like fighting animals or the natives in this game and these's almost no way to avoid that part of the game.

Story is cliche and boring.
The voice acting is corny and over acted.
The tutorial is worthless and bloated with story, yeah because I went to survival game tutorial to sit here and listen to two morons who can't even pretend to be human.
The actual gameplay may well be decent but I got utterly bored of wandering around stumbling into deaths. 
The game pretends to be a very realistic survival simulator but as soon as you try to apply any form of common sense to a situation you are immediately stumped and have to go and check the wiki to find out that ""Oh the only thing you can make a bottle out of in this entire rainforest is a coconut or a clay bottle which you would die of dehydration long before you can craft or a Bidon that only spawns in the story gamemodes"" So an hour of stumbling around unsuccessfully looking for a palm tree with some coconuts in it where you have to constantly walk around staring at the sky, later you will walk onto a snake which will basically just kill you because the cure is some random fucking herb you can't find and you can't treat the wound because bandages are made of one specific kind of yellow leaf apparently. I'll let the NHS know that they're doing THAT wrong then.

SO eventually you give up and drink unsafe water. You get parasites, obviously.
I check my notebook ""consume anti-parasitic herbs to cure this""
Yeah thanks notebook, what kind of herbs are those and where do i find them?
""Secret hehe""

So you have to go and consult the wiki because absolutely no effort to apply common sense or a decent tutorial is given to you so after about an hour you're just staring at the wiki going through page after page of random vegetation and where it all spawns.

Then you craft a stone blade and use the inspect feature to try and slit your own wrists with it but your braindead ""dehydrate to death in a day, also I will literally just fucking die if I get bit by one snake"" is too stupid to do even that right. 

Does our scientist who literally studies animals and plants all day know what a tourniquet is and how it may help in this venom situation? Apparently fucking not, it's like he deliberately elevates his heart rate so the venom kills him faster. Can't say I blame him because I'd want to kill myself if I played anymore of this game TOO.

All that said, I'm sure the game is fine but I don't have time to get a degree in biology just to play your mediocre Forest rip off.

I could literally get the exact same experience from the Forest or the Infected but I wouldn't have to read a wiki for 40 hours or pull a leach off my testicles every 15 steps.",1694208411,1694209045,False,9,6,0.491363346576690674,0,True,False,False

Graphically it is eye pleasing, survival is somewhat difficult until you learn what is what and how everything works. Once you learn it all after some playing, the game becomes a no challenge.
The developers think a challenge is a constant Spider, Centipede etc. crawling over you, but no. That is not a challenge, that is just an annoyance and should have more configuration to it by players to change as they like. Now you can just turn them on or off.

Green Hell, as usually these days with games, is not really worth the full price in my opinion. It is too empty, too little to do and I could go on, but what is the point. Nobody is going to read this anyway.

Beautifully designed environment and awesome atmosphere. But all the sounds are low quality and badly panned (or sourced idk what's the term of it ~ the distance and the animal's sound never matches. You are walking away and it's still like in your head) and I'm using $40-ish headphones only. 

Also the survival system is a bit weird, eating tons of meat but dying because of a banana? (or any fruit). Drinking tons of water from a pot and 10 secs later~ oh, so thirsty. Still fun tho, I'm enjoying with customized settings: food consumption is low and all other hostile things are on. That way feel better-balanced actually, since it's literally hard to find a stone in a forest and takes too much time to gather stuff in that SMALL sized map. While you are getting hungry so quickly in normal consumption speed. Combat - easy because your are fighting with a lords of bugs. But I still keep them (you can remove if you want) it's fun to run away.
---

The map is pretty small for a sandbox and crafting is super easy and limited. You are in a circle of troubles (besides hostile attacks) leeches - worms - parasites etc. Some of them appears with an interaction and some of them randomly. It slows you down often, that way you can think the map is big actually.

+ Beautiful forest to walk around
+ Good atmosphere

- Bad ambiance
- Animal noises
- Environmental sounds
- Combat bugs
- Enemy bugs
- Co-op bugs (like: many times happened that only one of you can see the enemy. it's not the low sanity effect, it's the real enemy)

And again, animal noises are the worst, makes the game really boring when you hear those low quality mp3 sound files. 

Waste of money. 

All the scores you see 8/10 is probably a marketing.

2/10

*Well I can't make a real progress in those sandbox games within 2 hours to understand if it's worthy to keep playing or refund it.
You buy this, and you get stuck.

First of all the game claims to be open world but an open world typically doesn't make you feel like you're in an endless maze of canyons that force you to follow certain paths. This game does exactly that and it makes navigating so unpleasant because you use your map and gps coordinates to get somewhere only to discover it's blocked by a massive canyon wall that you'll have to walk 2342356234242 miles around to get over which throws you way off course. 

 The spawning of animals, predators and venomous everythings are so predictable due to dated triggers. Example, if you walk into a cave with a scorpion blocking the bath and kill it, you can bet everytime you return the scorpion will be there. If you crawl into a creek bed you can bet you're about to get attacked by a jaguar because well he always spawns when you enter the creek bed. It's so obvious it's tacky. 

 The day night cycle is WAYY too fast. 1 hour is 60 seconds. So about every 10 minutes or so, you're in darkness. This is yet another poor design. Predators like the Jaguar have no sense of self preservation nor do they even flinch when you thrust spears into them, they just keep attacking like robots till you and/or them die.

Snakes are OVERKILL OVERKILL OVERKILL!!!!! You can't take 10 steps without running into a Q#$Q$$#%W#%$@Q$#v SNAKE! It's ridiculous. The game is hard but not in a realistic way. It's hard in an arcade game kind of way. The developers are not good designers and should make mobile PC games instead, maybe something along the lines of candy crush.

ok that  was easier... compared to surviving the first day in this game...
once you learn how to identify plants by the shape of their leaves, flowers, etc.
it gets slightly easier...

protips for starters, you can break down stones you find into smaller stones.
you can harvest fiber from plants such as palm leaves and others so you can start your fire.
you can harvest magots from spoiled meat in your backpack, if fruit spoils, save it, you can use it as fertilizer later, you can craft armor right from the start using stick, plantain leaf and rope.
everything has a use, if you need ashes you can harvest it from charcoal, if you get sick, eat the charcoal. 

you will alway want to have bandages, magots, ants and water in your backpack. 
eat the mushroom, they are good for you, except the large brown one. 
food is actually very abundant in the jungle, disease and wounds are terrible...

navigation is kind of easy, your watch has a gps it will show you the coordinates, you match it with the ones from the map and you will known exactly where you are. if you build a base somewhere, write its coordinates down in some paper and you will be fine going out to explore

All the mechanics in the game seem reasonable at first, it is called green hell, but they are unrealistic frustrating annoyances.

It just adds insult to the injury that the game completely lacks any kind of quality of life features and the devs don't care. The coop is completely bollocks. You lose your inventory constantly, even unique items. How is that in any way a good mechanic?

To describe this game in simple terms, its like The Forest in a rainforest and you have more things to manage besides blood, basic hunger, and water. The most recognizable thing this game has is its hunger system, where the universal ""hunger"" is split into 3 macro-nutrients you have to manage (fats, protein, and carbs). You will have to balance the core needs with other systems such as sleep, dirtiness, and inspection of your arms and legs for special conditions such as rashes.

For a more detailed description, this game emphasizes the difficulty with surviving in a rain-forest, especially on the harder difficulties. At first, you might be solely focusing on food and hydration but as you get better you start to understand the game loop and get more time to explore and build. It can feel rewarding as your game experience starts to allow you to master the unforgiving jungle. If the above facts may sound daunting, they can be mastered, but it may not be for everyone as you have manage more than other survival games. 

Another note is that the combat is pretty janky. Even if combat is a small part of the game, you will face it and it was probably my largest grievance. It was annoying whenever I had to fight something as hits didn't have good feedback, worsened by some enemies hitting you back right after you hit them, giving you conditions you have to manage post fight. There are also hazards that only YOU can be affected by that enemies can run by scot free which feels cheap as only you are subject to the difficulties with the environment. 

Even if the combat is annoying, there is still a lot to enjoy about this game and survival game enthusiasts should definitely give this game a try

Spirits of Amazonia - chill and chores

Very unique game even with so much survival genre games around. It has a recognizable feel to it that is beautiful, fun, challenging and very addictive. Well worth the money.
Loved the story. In general I am very happy with the game and would recommend it.

There were few bugs:
- in SOA after pushing a certain rock sound from that action will repeat every time I loaded the game
- Character would shout out phrases without any reason. For example ""Stupid piece of s..."" even thou nothing is broken. Few late night sessions this scared that stupid piece of .... out of me. I guess poor guy was loosing it even then XD
- few times thing would float  in the air - plants, mushrooms
- if I was hurt and loaded the previous save the wounds of statuses would remain
- if I saved too close to the enemy village and load, all the NPCs would be gone

The only downside (that makes the game much easier tbh) is AI. Enemies are... well let me just say I watched certain individuals patrol while their friends are getting slaughtered, some run in circles, some get stuck in things, and some disassociate and forget all about the war raging behind them. If you climb on a rock the brute with mask guy will do this dance number with axes... poor thing.

But at the end it all made me laugh and it helped the stress of survival.

They have added more content and another story mode which give you a lot more to do.  In other words, you don't feel like you are just running to the end of the map to get out of the jungle.  

The construction aspect is still temperamental, like most of these games, they just can't seem to get it right.  There is no option, that I know of, to move things once they are built, even small things.  Very weird.  

Items fit oddly into your inventory compared to boxes and depending on how you flip them they will shrink in size, very weird.  Meat weighs 3 pounds in some cases, yet, it won't fill you in one sitting.  Very weird.  All this is just stuff you have to get used to but adds a little lack of realism which cause a learning curve.  I find myself asking, what is making me so heavy--often.  

The new tree house is a massive building project--kind of fun--kind of annoying.  It is very nice once you have it all done and situated.  Eager to see the new things they are developing.  

The fact that you can hold Alt to pick up a whole stack of things is nice, but these little tips not being clear in the game-play is a little frustrating.  Same goes for holding L-Shift to steady your bow, though it is clearly an option in the controls of your settings screen.  

I find the new two two-handed axe-wielding beast of a man a fun mini-boss addition, very nice.  Guy can take more than 10 arrows.  Insane!  

Rocks are still super spastic, there will be four large stones, you pick one up but when you return there are none.  

Carrying the crying child across the entire map solo is the first thing that makes me think it really is a Green Hell.  Better to have two or more people so you can look at your map and kill critters.  

Creature glowing a weird green, buggy.

Drinking from a large bowel will sometimes allow you to drink/eat twice sometimes not.  Harvesting a log will rarely give you two planks, another odd, with no explanation, event I wish I could control.

The text overlapping on item stats has not been corrected.

They force you to use long sticks when building some structures when the sticks are obviously small sticks. 

Overall the game has increased from about 60 hours to more than 200 hours of things to do.  The replay-ability is high, especially with a friend.  The map is extensive.  The discovery of game content has greatly increased.  I recommend a decent computer with a quality display.

As I progressed with the story, I waited with bated breath to see how it would unfold, how I would find out what actually happened in that first preview.

My enthusiasm gradually waned. The story started out great and I couldn't wait and it ended up being a complete bore. Nothing was explained and it felt artificial and unfinished. Spirits of Amazonia (SoA) is much more interesting, interacting with villagers and completing tasks for them. But at the moment I'm at the second village, I don't enjoy the game in general, carrying screaming children on my shoulders already really annoys me, and the only thing I enjoy is shooting some natives in the head when I meet one. For how phenomenal a start it has, the rest of the game is incredibly boring. And you can't help but compare it to the series Lost. Both have an interesting beginning, full of mysteries, the viewer/player waits for how it will be explained, but it is not explained, gradually it loses all fun and after finding out how it ends, the viewer/player asks himself why he wasted his time.

Of course, those looking for a challenge in the game are in the right place. Multiplayer is especially challenging. My experience with multiplayer is as a player who was not hosting, but rather joining a hosting player.

Every time I logged out of the treehouse in multiplayer, I fell to the ground after logging in. The wound I inflicted immediately became infected, and only because I logged out with full HP and we had enough first aid items in the base did I not die because we are playing on a harder difficulty. In the case of logging out at the water base, on the other hand, I fell into the water. The piranhas injured 3 of my 4 limbs and due to the initial disorientation I almost did not find my way out. That's why I always had to log off on the shore or on the ground under a tree.

In SoA multiplayer, it happened to us repeatedly that after placing all the materials on the piles of toxic waste, or when burning dead villagers, the structure was not completed and could not be lit. Fortunately, a lot of reputation among the villagers can be gained through legendaries, but if someone is trying to get achievements, they should do it in singleplayer, where this mechanic works without bugs.

In multiplayer, it repeatedly happened to me that my weapon disappeared from my hand. Even though the other player could see it in my hand, I couldn't, and when I hit the attack button, I was just punching. Since this happened to me repeatedly with the iron ax shortly after we made it, I lost 2 new iron axes.

When the non-hosting player disconnects before the hosting player, they lose all progress: skills, backpack items. As its progress is restored to the last inventory save point. Which can only be done if the hosting player shuts down the game first. Probably the only bug in the game that can be used to the advantage of the player, because if he saves his inventory when he has, for example, 1 piece of iron armor in his backpack, he puts it in the chest and logs out-logs in, he has it in his backpack again and in this chest will also remain. If the player repeats this 3 times, he can turn 1 piece of armor into complete armor within a few seconds. It also works with things that are only in the game 1x. E.g. metal water bottle, metal kettle... Ropes can be duplicated in the same way, for example: put 10 ropes in the rack, rlg and the player has 10 ropes in the backpack again. If the base is being built on the water, where a lot of ropes are needed, this way the construction can progress very quickly. In the same way, it is possible to make a complete armadillo armor for several players from just 1 armadillo. Despite the possibility of making the game much easier, it's still a bug and it would be good if it was fixed.

After finishing the game with the ""good ending"" the whole game crashed and it was impossible to finish the game even with the ""bad ending"" for the achievement. It didn't even help to start a new game and run it, neither in singleplayer nor in multiplayer. Whenever the bad ending preview ends, the game crashes instead of the credits. I haven't tried reinstalling the game yet, because with how many bugs there are in this game, I'm worried about losing saved positions in singleplayer and saved inventory in multiplayer.

And unfortunately, I could continue like this for a while, because there are really many bugs in multiplayer. I only mentioned the ones that I personally found most annoying.

Unfortunately, the game also has a number of moments that are at least thought-provoking.

When shooting a bow, arrows are drawn randomly from different stacks. So if he started the combat with 15 arrows and ended with 5, it happens that he has 5 arrows divided into 3 stacks instead of 1.
The story doesn't connect well. In the first story, Jake Higgins confides in a broken voice to Mia that he was attacked by a native, whom he killed in self-defense. Meanwhile, in SoA, which takes place before the events of the story, he kills natives by the dozen and has no problem with it. So I don't understand why it was such a traumatic experience for him in the story when he could have been called the Native Slayer at the time.

And again, I could go on with examples.

Despite all of that, I have to admit that I ended up liking the game. Although the story is worth nothing, and the player who skips it does not lose anything. In the game, I spent tens of hours in survival mode building breathtaking tree houses, forts on water. By growing crops, crafting and hunting.

The beautiful environment is definitely worth exploring at least in tourist mode. I really like the crafting system and find it sophisticated and undemanding. In addition, if the player remembers the recipe, even at skill 1, he can make a bow and go into a real fight. I like the different ways of processing meat and bones, tubers and even fruit. Cooking soups and decoctions, drying and smoking meat. I always thoroughly enjoyed all of this when I returned from a longer adventure.

Some of the funniest moments include when a native broke 1 piece of my armor in a duel. I processed the native and made a spare part from his bones. I admit it's a little morbid, but in my defense - he started it.

Even though I'm planning on taking a longer break now, I'm still looking forward to getting back into SoA and finishing it up. And maybe one day I'll be pleasantly surprised that the story gets a little better.",1691156983,1691156983,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I went into this game with my wife and did a coop play from start to finish. The punishing survival style of this game I was all for. The concept and general premise are great. The Jungle and graphics/sound design are very well done. So why am I not willing to recommend this game. Because it is abandon wear and truly the pinnacle of requiring you to look stuff up online. Without a wiki, this game is unplayable. 

Tutorial. The tutorial area of the game needs major rework. While it teaches you the basics it fails to mention an important part of the game. Armor. Everything craft able is done by combining things in your backpack similar to The Forest. Now when I say everything is craft able with items from your backpack I mean EVERYTHING (except the bow). So how the hell, without looking it up online, is a player expected to figure out you must use a banana leaf (which can not be placed in your inventory and must be hand carried) be the MAIN component of armor? This is never shown (such as your find an armor piece using the leaf), this is never told (such as a note which there are plenty of), nor is this ever hinted at (such as in the radio conversations). This is figured out by looking on the wiki. While the game can be done without armor it is an unbearable slog to do so. 

The bugs. You leave meat on a drying rack, you travel far away. You come back and it is gone. The gold sack was literally taken out of my inventory by my wife when she picked it up from the table that it spawns at. Water containers and bones never de-spawn, but a multitude of other things important things constantly do. Get poisoned, fix poison, sometimes health continues to drain after full removal. Kill jaguar, die from wounds, 20 second run back to death location from respawn location, jaguar body de-spawned. Character randomly stops being able to look around with mouse movement input, can still do everything but move and look around. The biggest one of them all, The cherry on top, in CO-OP YOU CANT ALWAYS GET THE ALTERNATIVE ENDING DUE TO A GAME BREAKING BUG THAT HAS BE DOCUMENTED SINCE 2020. 

Invisible walls. This game has more invisible walls and barriers than Destiny 1 and 2. 

Death. Death is simple. You die. You respawn at your last rest locations you go back to your body and pick things up. Typically lose anywhere between 1/3 to 3/4 of your inventory items. Not sure if this is some weird glitch tied to de-spawning or intended, so for now I will consider it intended design. However, instead of dropping a backpack with the remaining items, you blow up like a Minecraft character that just fell 40 blocks and hit the ground too hard. You then must manually pick up the items one by one in a god-awful slog of time wasting. Why? You already punished the player with the item loss, why also punish them with the slog of picking back up every item piece by piece. Just drop a backpack since you know, THE GAMES INVETORY IS ONE.

Backpack/inventory. This game has a resident evil 4 inventory system which I love! You can place and space out items however you want while also being able to stack small amounts of items. Good system. Gets ruined by the fact that you also have an over encumbrance system. WHY!? Most games have ether or. Not both. Fallout, Baulders Gate and Skyrim you have unlimited inventory, but you have an encumbrance system. That’s fine. Minecraft, Resident Evil, and Rust. You have limited inventory spaces. That is fine. This game, you have both for no reason. If you wanted the player to carry limited amount of items make the back pack smaller. If you wanted the player to only carry so much make the encumbrance system, but not a mix of the two. The auto sorting of this game when you pick an item up the takes up a new section of your backpack is almost designed to be place in the most efficient placement possible. 

The building. Let’s say you want to build a simple 4x4 block style base. You will be grinding out the resources of the next hour to do so. Let’s say you want to place a “ghost build” of your design before you start placing resources into it. You can’t even place the ghost build until the whole area is cleared out. Can you cut down ANY tree for your materials, no you must only cut trees that don’t have vines on them. Is there snapping so you can build the hut base uniformly? No. and the problem is when you drop items they will sometimes fall in between the cracks of your building never to be retrievable again unless you destroy your floor/frame. Basic features found in a multitude of other games is just flat out missing here. And most annoying, you can only carry a total of 5 tools on you at any given time (which is fine), BUT THE GAME HAS NO BUILDABLE TOOL RACK TO STORE EXTRAS. You also CAN NOT place tools in crafted chest. You just have to drop it on the floor and hope it doesn’t de-spawn when you come back.

The combat. Not bad. Just use the bow and learn to headshot to win. Gets very repetitive after many hours.
If this game was released today in this current state as an early access, I would totally be happy with it and be stoked at the future to come with this games potential. This would be an easy recommendation from me. However, this is considered a completed product and thus has failed to meet an even minimum bar of what other games do far better in the survival craft/builder genre.

Well, Green Hell is NOT one of those shows! If you want to experience the jungle while being chased by an angry jaguar, eaten alive by mosquitos, and struggling to find food like a lost puppy, then this game is your dream come true!

Let me tell you, it's no walk in the park - it's more like a sprint through the Amazon rainforest chased by a stampede of tapirs. Within the first ten minutes, I was already a buffet for all the insects in the world. I mean, mosquitoes have their own personal GPS just to find me! I don't know what they put in that bug spray, but I'm convinced it's flavored like a five-star gourmet meal for bugs.

Now, building a shelter may sound easy, but in Green Hell, I have the architectural skills of a drunken sloth. My first hut looked like it was designed by a toddler with Lego blocks. If anything, it probably gave the jaguars a good laugh before they pounced on me. But hey, who needs walls when the jungle critters are such fantastic decorators?

I attempted fishing, thinking it'd be as easy as catching Pokémon in a pond. But boy, was I wrong!

I'm pretty sure the piranha family has my picture hanging in their living room with the caption: ""Don't mess with this guy, he's a walking buffet!""

Then, there are the locals – the indigenous tribe. They probably think I'm the comic relief in their jungle soap opera. I tried communicating with them, but my pantomime skills are on par with a mime in a tornado. We had a staring contest, and let's just say I blinked first, and they weren't impressed!

Despite my endless misadventures, I can't help but love Green Hell. The graphics are so immersive that I can practically smell the damp earth and hear the sounds of the jungle around me. I feel like Bear Grylls on steroids, even though my survival skills are more ""Blair Witch Project"" than ""Survivor Man.""

Jokes aside, Green Hell is a challenging and thrilling survival experience that's worth every mosquito bite and comedic death. It's like stepping into the shoes of a true jungle explorer, where even drinking water can be a life-or-death situation. Just make sure you've got a sense of humor, or you'll go crazy faster than a toucan on Red Bull!

So, if you're ready for a game that tests your wits, survival skills, and comedic talents all at once, venture into Green Hell and join the ranks of jungle explorers with stories that'd make Indiana Jones jealous!",1690991677,1690991677,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, I enjoy challenge as much as the next guy... but there's a fine line between ""challenging the player"" and ""intentionally neglecting basic QOL features to make the player suffer"".

[b]The Good:[/b]
The game does indeed present you with a compelling scenario of solo wilderness survival in the trackless depths of the Amazon. Note that I said ""compelling"", not ""realistic"" or ""fun"". The story of the main quest is a psychological horror thriller which is actually really well-written, well-voiced and avoids most of the tired tropes of the genre.

[b]The Meh:[/b]
The difficulty curve is paradoxically difficult to learn but easy to master. At the start of the game, you have zero explanation of what to do or how things work - death is guaranteed. For instance, it took like five IRL hours to figure out that you can get small stones by ""harvesting"" big stones, which greatly inflated the early grind.

The inverted difficulty curve is largely because schematics for weapons/tools/buildings are locked until you pick one up, craft it by accident or - in the case of buildings - see an example firsthand. Schematics for armor - which is INCREDIBLY important - do not EVER get unlocked until you craft it blindly (or, more likely, read the wiki). 

And when you do craft stuff, expect it to fall apart VERY quickly. I spent IRL hours smelting, then crafting ""metal"" armor and weapons... the best in the game... only to watch them degrade to nothing in a day or two of light use. Insult to injury: I'm pretty sure the metal spear is inferior to the ""tribal spear"" you get for free for killing one of an endlessly-spawning horde of howling natives.

But, once you figure out the basics, the game becomes trivial and the only challenge is fighting the annoying game mechanics, not actually surviving. For instance, i just ran into a patrol of 8 hostile natives and proceeded to headshot each one with a handcrafted survival bow without taking a single hit.

Hunting is functional, but completely unrealistic. The best way to hunt is by getting headshots, which any IRL hunter will tell you is breathtakingly stupid. Real hunters try to take down an animal with one hit to the heart, liver or lungs; failing that, they will follow the blood trail. In Green Hell, you either headshot 'em in one hit or kiss that animal goodbye, as it runs away far faster than you to die somewhere you'll likely never find (or just glitch out of the map) with NO blood trail. Hunting is marginally better with a spear than a bow, since even a non-headshot with a spear will kill an animal before they make it 10 yards.

[b]The Bad[/b]
Surviving parasites, disease, hostile natives, hungry jaguars... none of that is difficult once you figure the game out. What's ""difficult"" is exploring the map (and the game doesn't even GIVE you a map until you randomly stumble across it) in the TWENTY FOUR EFFING MINUTES of daylight you have per day.

The ridiculous speed of the abstracted day/night cycle forces the player to rush through EVERYTHING. But, if you run everywhere, you're liable to get stung by an emperor scorpion... which is extremely difficult to see, but you can (somehow) hear. And, no matter what armor you're wearing, that sting will magically go right through it.

AND that will basically end your day RIGHT THEN AND THERE, because the fever caused by the sting will quickly sap your strength until you pass out... then wake up on the floor in the dark with blowfly larvae implanted in every limb. If you don't use one bone needle (gained by ""harvesting"" bones) to remove the larva (one needle each), you will quickly go insane. Then, if you don't bandage those four ghetto Amazonian surgery wounds immediately, they're going to get infected.

The first time I had an infected wound, i had no clue what to do with it because I didn't learn until later, checking on the wiki, that the only solution is waiting until meat in your inventory spoils so you can ""harvest"" maggots to eat the infected flesh. So wherever you go exploring, make sure you take a handful of maggots with you LOL FML I'M NOT KIDDING.

So, by not hearing the ""scratchy scratch scratch"" scorpion sound and immediately leaping backwards, you lose an entire day of exploring, 4 bone needles, 4 bandages, most of your food and ALL of your clean water. Did I mention that ALL the water in the game is infected with parasites and you can't boil water in a metal canteen? ""Fun""!

Then you have to limp back to base... where there's even odds that a patrol of natives will be wantonly destroying all your stuff. Also they will spawn inside your walls, behind your traps. The devs knew this is an issue for years and have finally admitted it, but don't know how to fix it. Also I would have preferred fewer, but more dangerous natives over endless hordes of Amazonian orcs.

Oh yeah, and my mild annoyance with animal behavior turns to EXTREME annoyance when it comes to alligators. Unlike IRL, Green Hell alligators are extremely slow and go down after two arrows to the head. They do not rush out of the water to insta-kill you, which would be fairly reasonable. They see you and then leisurely chase you at turtle-speed across the entire map until you kill it. You'll hear a loud HISS, then five minutes later chilling in your base hear a CHOMP as a chunk of your health bar disappears.

Because there are rarely hints of where to go or what to do, the only way to progress the game is to search miles and miles of trackless jungle one inch at a time, 24 MINUTES at  a stretch. And after about half an iRL hour of exploring, you'll need to trek all the way back to your base to reload on 3 different types of food and 3 different types of bandages.

Once you stumble across everything in the story by process of elimination - which takes about 20 hours if you don't spend much time having fun (i.e. building a barbie dreamhouse in a giant brazil nut tree and getting a pet capybara) - there is a mystery at the end that - if you even know it exists - allows you a path to unlock the good ending.

Oh yeah and in order to find the ""good ending"" mystery machine, you need to ignore the main path in the final area and swim off randomly into the river for REASONS. This is made more obnoxious by the fact that the MAP for the final area is in the same location as the mystery machine, so the only way to find it is by exploring blindly.

I admit that the solution for the super spoiler good ending mystery machine is kind of clever, but all the clues that hint at the solution are hours away from each other... or you can just look it up on the wiki. I briefly considered solving the mystery with my own very tired, very annoyed brain... and promptly chose the latter.

The expansion, Spirits of Amazonia, doubles down on all the things that were annoying about the main quest. Instead of one needle in a haystack at one time, you have to find like 3 dozen in the FIRST MAP (checking the wiki, the actual number of not-on-your map waypoints is OVER FORTY THREE FUCK ME).

I was dutifully exploring the SOB on the ""Hard"" difficulty and had discovered about half of the quest points in the starting map of SOA before being inspired to write this review... and I think I'm done for the foreseeable future. Maybe I'll do another run on Medium later. Or maybe I'll never touch this thing again. IDK honestly.

If I go to certain locations, scripted predator or native encounters will ALWAYS occur. With this foreknowledge, at just 4 hours in, the incredible sense of immersion breaks down into gamified strategy. This game needs a semi-randomized map, maybe in the form of a deck of tiles that gets shuffled and blindly distributed into a grid instead of proc gen.

I'm going to stick it out and see if Green Hell can capture me now or after a major update.

An amazing gritty survival experience. Green Hell is well-named, you are in a rainforest/jungle environment and there are things waiting to kill you at every turn. But everything is appropriately difficult, and as you learn your surroundings you'll find that helpful resources are also all around you. 
The survival gameplay is intuitive and immersive. The macro-nutrient system is great at encouraging a varied or well planned diet. Most dangerous animals will signal their presence in some way (this game needs audio for cues). The crafting (and building) is good, with the ability to experiment out recipes or learning them. The cherry on top of all of what I said is how involved and communicative the dev team has been. I have had this game for a while and it's been great to see all the improvements to the game 
Another key element is the story. I had such a great time playing through the story of this game, and was hooked throughout. After finishing the story I have so many thoughts but I don't want to spoil anything, but I highly recommend that you go through it yourself.

One of the most captivating aspects of Green Hell is its stunning graphics and attention to detail. The environment is beautifully rendered, with the dense vegetation, wildlife, and weather effects adding a sense of realism that is both mesmerizing and intimidating. The dynamic day-night cycle and ever-changing weather conditions add an extra layer of challenge, constantly keeping players on their toes.

Survival in Green Hell is no easy feat, and the game excels at capturing the essence of the struggle for existence in a harsh and unforgiving environment. The need to manage hunger, thirst, body temperature, and injuries provides a deep level of immersion, as players must carefully plan their actions and make difficult decisions to stay alive.

The crafting system in Green Hell is robust and well-designed. It allows players to create tools, weapons, and shelter using resources found in the wild. The emphasis on realism is evident here, as the crafting recipes are logical and make sense in the context of survival. This aspect adds depth to the gameplay and encourages exploration to discover new resources and blueprints.

However, while the survival mechanics are incredibly engaging, they can also be quite punishing. Green Hell doesn't hold your hand, and mistakes often come with severe consequences. Some players might find the difficulty level to be a bit overwhelming, especially for those new to the survival genre.

Furthermore, the storyline, while present, may feel a bit lacking in comparison to other survival games. The focus here is more on the player's personal journey and the challenges they face in the Amazon rather than a grand narrative. For some, this could be a downside, but others might appreciate the freedom to create their own adventure.

Multiplayer mode is a welcome addition to Green Hell, allowing players to tackle the jungle together or face off against each other. This mode adds an extra layer of enjoyment and replayability, as teaming up with friends can make survival a more manageable, yet still thrilling, experience.

In conclusion, Green Hell is an intense and visually stunning survival game that truly puts players to the test. It's a must-play for fans of the genre and those seeking a challenging and immersive adventure in the heart of one of the world's most dangerous and beautiful environments. While the difficulty level and minimal narrative might not appeal to everyone, the sense of accomplishment that comes with surviving the perils of Green Hell is undeniably gratifying. So, grab your machete and embark on this exhilarating journey into nature's fury!",1690058249,1690058249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The level of realism is very impressive, the combat is rather unforgiving, and the sheer difficulty... I can say without a doubt that this is definitely a must play for anyone who likes the survival genre and enjoys a challenge. Even at the ""lowest"" difficulty, one wrong move or one false step could spell your end... Fighting off predators such as pumas, jaguars, caiman, snakes, scorpions, etc. are but one aspect of the challenge. You have to sleep, forage for food, keep hydrated (might want to boil that water first...), build a shelter, etc. You can get leeches, you can contract food poisoning, just about ANYTHING can end your life.

After playing through the original campaign (not the additional campaign  ""Spirits of Amazonia"") and some single / multiplayer survival games, my opinion is simple: a really great game.

positiv:
- the story is long enough to keep you busy but not that long that you think you never get through
- graphics and sound match the area you play in very good
- given some choices of making the game easy, medium or even hard and harder you find the perfect match for everyone
- the complexity to craft tools, bandages and generate food variation from plants and wildlife is great
- you do not know much when you start the game about tools etc. -> try and error gives a lot of fun and, sometimes, you think ""how often do I have to fail for one solution?"" - a great experience
- single player games can be transferred into a multiplayer coop game -> interesting solution
- there are still additions in gameplay coming (e.g. ""transportation update"")

negativ:
no negative impressions so far - I still find a lot of fun in wandering through the jungle while experimenting with all materials I find in order to craft or cook new stuff / meals.

My gripes are not with the game, but with the devs. These people seem to think its okay to sit here under the radar for most people and not finish their other ports for VR, like the quest and steam VR port. Now I get it, the way a company works is basically to put effort in what is making the most money. Okay I am cool with that. BUT DONT SIT HERE AND MAKE THE VR PORTS TWO DIFFERENT GAMES. FUCKING CHRIST ITS LIKE NINTENDO DAYS WHERE TWO COMPANIES WOULD MAKE A GAME WITH THE EXACT SAME NAME AND YOU HAD TO FIND YOUR WAY THROUGH ALL THE FALSE ADVERTISEMENT ONLY TO FIND OUT BOTH OF THEM ARE NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL. This is the company that has not thrown out a update for vr on both quest and pc in a long time but will shell out for desktop. The misleading part im talking about is not that you dont get the same items in vr as you would desktop no no no much worse. IS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT GAMES WITH TWO DIFFERENT MAPS AND EVERYTHING, THIS IS FUCKING SAD. Also the fact I did test the new update for the transportation update and my only gripe while testing this was i messaged the devs on discord and said in these exact words "" please make the transportation beta actual survival so i can properly test the update other wise it just dont feel right i can understand not adding in story yet but i hate that its just creative mode with extra steps i want tiredness and exhaustion to actually test the update properly and not half assed"" and their response is ""Beta will stay creative. It's better for testing as those who are testing don't have to waste time dealing with these micro-managements.

If you would like to keep playing survival we would recommend you play the current stable release version and wait for the new beta stuff to come out in a future update.""
LIKE REALLY HOW CAN WE PROPERLY TEST ANYTHING IF WE CANT TRULY EXPERIENCE IT.

Previous Review:
Overall the game was good until you have to keep constantly healing from walking through water ""EVERY"" time, until you run out for medical plants and shrooms and food. Get ready to just keep scraping parasites from yourself and healing 70% of the time until you run out of food because your ALWAYS LOOKING FOR MEDS.

First of all i gotta say that the game feels just right about forest, you have to act like how you would if you were to be in a jungle like that in real life. You don't feel comfortable while roaming around trying to find things, you don't know what's lying beneath you and that makes you avoid getting into big bushes, long grasses etc. without getting paranoid (shorts ? really ? in a jungle like that ?). Creatures make you scared as well (like how they would in real life) for example if you were to see a steelseries-rgb-keyboard looking like thing irl your inner voice would tell you to avoid that thing because that thing is poisonous bro telling you. So for the ''nature'' part of the game i can easily say that they've made a good job and to be honest if there was a neutral option i would go for it instead of ''not recommended''.

BUT

For the survival part of it big big nos. HOW ON EARTH CAN SOMEONE GET HUNGRY EVERY FUCKING 5.39×10⁻⁴⁴ SECONDS BRO. YOU BREATHE IN YOU GET HUNGRY, YOU BREATHE OUT YOU GET HUNGRY, YOU REMEMBERED SOMETHING YOU GET HUNGRY, YOU EAT YOU GET HUNGRY WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU MADE OF BRO ???? The game's logic thinks that every time you blink you get hungry but no developers, that's not how a real human body works. ''🤓👆 but by blinking your body consumes 8.234x10⁻⁴ calories''  NO BRO FUCK OFF IT DOESN'T. So imagine if you were an obese who weighs 1890 LBS you eat like what 30 meals a day ? THIS MOTHER FUCKER EATS 10x MORE THAN A PERSON WHO IS AS HEAVY AS A FAMILY TRUCK. I JUST DON'T GET IT BRO WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU GUYS THINKING WHILE MAKING THIS STUPID ASS MECHANIC. 

I really want to go further in this game like i really wonder what's gonna happen between this couple but i can not bro. I don't feel like i'm surviving it's just feels so frustrating. In addition to everything the optimization is not so good, i'm barely getting 80 FPS with RTX 3060 x i5-12400f i've tried to adjust some settings but they didn't do much.

Completing the game is the second rarest achievement, with the rarest achievement being to unlock all the achievements because it involves completing the story and spending more time in the game than I feel like is possible. 
From homing capybaras, killing them because you forgot to clean their poop, to running across the rainforest desperately trying to figure out how tf all the maps connect, this game is the most half-hazard, difficult, yet hilarious survival game I have ever played. 
Surviving the day to day is extremely difficult to learn even on normal mode, but no matter how prepared and comfortable you are in the rain forest you can still get cucked by a random jaguar (unless you headshot them because bows and arrows are busted). 
Would I recommend the game? yes
Would I recommend the story/spirits of amazonia? hell no, (unless you like tripping on acid) I completed it and all it does by the end is have you run for 40 minutes to the other side of the jungle through multiple very specific access points using the most convoluted map I've ever seen in a game.
Why cant you mark the map?? Why doesn't our MC tape them together?? WE HAVE A PENCIL WHY CANT WE EDIT THE MAP TO MARK BASES OR POINTS OF INTEREST?? 
In conclusion, this game sucks you in because you feel like you're nothing if you don't complete the game, I found myself telling myself that I didn't care about finishing the game because I spent hours simply doing fetch quests, but god damn it I needed to see the end just so I could sleep at night.",1689200626,1689200626,True,1,0,0.523333311080932617,0,True,False,False

The difficulty, challenge, stress and ultimately joy you experience with this game comes from knowing nothing and learning as you fail to survive. 

Not knowing how to safely consume water. 
Being ignorant of the flora and the effects various plants have on your health and body. 
Not knowing what animals are a threat, where they linger and how they hunt. 
Not knowing how to engage the hostile natives. 
Not knowing how and where to procure sources of food. 
Not knowing where you are and where you need to go to survive and make progress. 
Not knowing how to craft and use things that make your survival possible. 
Not knowing how to balance all these elements together under the constant pressure of keeping yourself hydrated, sated and healthy. 

You are likely to step from one puddle of filth into the next until you are an unstoppable snowball of disease and deficits. 
It made me greatly appreciate the fact that I get to eat and drink safe food and water every day. Because eating that strange mushroom you have never seen before and puking out the last few nutrients and liquids in your body in a desperate attempt to stay alive is about as foolhardy as running through a jungle with a freshly gashing wound.
Inversely this means that once you know the listed things above, the game becomes quite trivial. I played it immediately on the highest difficulty without perma-death to be able to enjoy the humiliation and suffering on my first playthrough. Doing a no death run on my second was extremely easy and I was essentially set after an hour and spent another four on excessive paranoia. The game unfortunately is only balanced for the start. Later on it is almost impossible to die and certain aspects and items you can use and or procure are massively overpowered. I wish they had introduced more threats, gave you less powerful tools and encouraged you to go out into hazardous areas to procure valuable resources.

The building system is something I also found quite punitive. Something it has in common with The Forest but it is a spoiler.
[spoiler] You have a fairly extensive amount of buildings and connections but the combination of it being incredibly time intensive as every piece you build takes a massive amount of manual labor and resource gathering combined with the fact that hostiles can and will destroy everything you build unless you build on trees or water leads to me feeling extremely discouraged from building anything. It is much more satisfying to build bare minimum bases all over the place and hop between them as you are progressing in a somewhat linear fashion for the story than try and settle down anywhere for more than a few days.
I saw absolutely zero reason to play the survival mode after the story mode. [/spoiler]]

Some of the later story locations feel like one and done areas and overall I think the game has problems with balance and direction. It doesn't work as a survival game on its own and it doesn't really have much meat as a story driven game and it takes some survival aspects very seriously while neglecting some completely. Which is fine. It is still a fun game to move about and figure out. I think my biggest disappointment lies with the weak item balancing as most of the stuff you can craft is essentially the same with differences so minor, the higher tiers are just not worth the effort. You can either spent 3 hours making the highest tier gear that won't break for probably your entire playthrough or you can occasionally spend 2 minutes making things out of dirt and sticks that has the same function but will break a few times. The one or two extra chops a low tier axe needs to fell a tree just don't weigh against the scrounging and processing time of quality resources and significant extra weight to carry. I'd choose the extra five kilos of food and water. Unless for some reason you want to spend weeks in multiplayer building excessive mega bases. There aren't enough different items to speak of personal customization but the few in the game barely differentiate between each other and I found ultimately only lighter weight matters so I can keep more crucial resources always at hand.

My conclusion is that is is a wonderful one and done blind playthrough struggle to success with several challenge modes and extra DLC campaign but I don't think I would enjoy it in multiplayer beyond watching a mate die to their own stupidity.
Ahh. the performance is pretty choppy. Lowering settings and resolution didn't do much. But if you're expecting ambitious indie survival games to have good technical performance you probably wouldn't make it in a jungle.",1689004057,1689004057,True,8,0,0.555933833122253418,0,True,False,False

Sounds fun, right? Well, not really. Green Hell is a hard and unforgiving game that will test your patience and sanity. It's not for the faint of heart or the casual gamer. It's more complicated and detailed than The Forest, which I still prefer because it's more simple and straightforward. Green Hell is a good game, but it can be stressful and frustrating at times. It's not like SCUM, which is basically a life simulator that makes you wonder why you're playing a game instead of living your life. But it's close.

I like to play a free game, but there is not what to do. it is boring.
I expected some progress. Something I need to do to step up. There is everything in the game. Don't need to be hard, but you must feel it is continuous fun. Not the same thing from start to... well no endless.  
It should be some progress in weapons, tools and buildings. Some better stats for everything. 
In the game you have beds, shelters and blueprints all around the open map. Resources and animals are too much linear.
You need anything you must just walk and there you will find it. Traps are boring too and you will never have problem to make a tool. All what is changed is durability and crazy much food from harvesting animals. Bones are everywhere and you can go true the whole game just with bone axe. You can use it for chopping, harvesting plants or metal ore. 

THE GAME IS JUST TO WASTE TIME. I think it is like work in a factory. You have your repeating tasks. 

Why can by limited something and you need go true a progress. Unlocking continuously by locations that must be visited in some order. Let say by reaching some point of experience you will unlock a tool that make you go to next area. Or blocked path by an danger animal (like a boss fight). Let say you will need to make base and collect experience in a map that will unlock you better weapon or more durable so you can face him. 

When I see this, then I expect this in other games from Creepy Jar. For sure not on Early access. This game is finished and same time not finished. It is working, but not way I'll be expected.
I literally never seen a game with same tools and weapons used from start to end. 

I find all maps, almost all points on maps, build many bases on every map, I brought mud bricks to airfield, and I feel like this is not a survival game. It is just like a builder game. Like I build a city in a jungle.

But what stopped me form loving this game, even though I have lived in the Amazon for eight years, was the constant feeling that the character you play as was such a wimp. His dialogue with Mia (his S.O.) is full of him whining almost. Some of it be warranted, but it seems his idea of exploring the jungle was an easy task and every challenge he faces proves him wrong and he made me feel like is a wuss just walking, like walking was too much of a challenge. 

Along with him being a wimp, you (the player) are running out of nutrients/hydration way too quickly in the early stages of game. You are constantly bombarded with rashes and leeches, with can be cured quickly if you got the right tools/healing items, but it happens so often I cant enjoy the beginning of the game.

To me, the beginning stages of any game like Green Hell, Sons of the Forest, Subnautica, are the most fun. The exploring, learning the crafting system, what goes with what and where to find  stuff; all that is the joy i love. But Green Hell just did not do it for me.

AND WHY CANT I FIND ROCKS AS OFTEN AS I SHOULD, the amazon jungle, river beds are bountiful with rocks and sticks, I grew up in Barcelos, Amazonas, Brazil, and often traveling in and out of villages along the Rio Negro and there are rocks everywhere, so whyyyyyyyyyyy are there not as a much for Christ's sake? lol

In conclusion, great game idea. Very harsh as it should be, but the dude whines too much, drains nutrients too fast, and very little rocks. 

Its beautiful, but i just cant get into it. If I were you, id give it a shot, to each their own; just not the same flavor as the above mentioned games.",1687794136,1687794136,False,84,10,0.680786669254302979,0,True,False,False

It has multiple delaying and irritating aspects that, until you learn to overcome them, will piss you off over and over.  You think you know how to play a survival, and YOU DO!!  All of those skills transfer here, but you have to learn how the devs want you to survive.  How they want you to get hurt and then how to deal with it.

Once you do so, survival becomes much much easier.  The story is very clever and interesting.  The mechanics are fun and you can lose yourself very pleasantly into just living like a king in the jungle.

Tips:
* Build armor, out of anything, to wear at all times.  Dealing with the wounds is more bothersome than wearing even stupid armor that will prevent them.
* Figure out how to treat fevers quickly (meds, shrooms, etc).
* Carry 4 honey bandages and 2 venom badges and replace them as soon as you use one.
* Carry a bone and a bowl at all times, bone soup FTW.

I enjoyed this game a lot, once my hunting partner convinced me to stop being a wuss about all the infections, venom bites and irritants.

And it does that better than all competitors out there. Basebuilding is amazingly satisfying. Crafting is logical and cool. Survival is an actual challenge and offers soooo much more detail than every other survival game. You can get infections, lacerations, abrasions, fever, poison, vomiting, parasites, worms, rashes.. and you need to avoid and/or treat them all. Hygiene is important, you need to constantly check yourself for leeches, pay attention to scorpions, spiders and snakes.. You need to keep all your macronutrients like proteins, fats and carbohydrates up, make sure you get clean water and you need to explore the jungle and get to know it's plants, mushrooms and all the other things the jungle has to offer..

But don't expect it to be easy. Sometimes you can feel like there is nothing threatening you anymore, you get carless and a snake bites you. No problem.. you got anti-venom dressings to treat the wound. But then the poison gives you fever. Fever makes you thirsty. So you drink all of your water. But you feel okay and keep going. But then that snakebite gets infected. So you put maggots on the wound to eat off the infected flesh. But that raises your fever and all of the sudden you're thirsty again. Water is gone. So you drink some dirty river water. Even more fever. You decide to head home. But you are losing energy super fast now and pass out in the middle of the jungle. You wake up infested with worms. You remove them using Fishbones and treat the open wounds with ash-dressings. But you are so sick now that you keep passing out and you get infested with worms again and again. After half an hour you make it back to base and with the last percent of energy you make it into your hammock. Just to die because the infections killed you in your sleep.

Not eating/sleeping doesn't just kill you outright like in other games, your character will slowly lose his mind and start tripping balls. Bug bites and cuts and scrapes don't just take health, they can become infected and cause you to lose sanity and slowly die. The detail in the survival mechanics is crazy too. Found a coconut? Don't just eat it, turn it into tools and bowls and use it to collect rainwater and carry stuff. Got some bones in your inventory? Well, it's your lucky day because you don't just have a bone: you have needles, fishing hooks, knives, and even soup. Everything in this game has multiple uses. Eat with dirty hands? Get a parasite.

Namely, while the mechanics of saving do make sense from an immersion point of view, the lack of quick-save without the benefit of a shelter is a serious hindrance -  mostly because as beautiful and immersive as this game can be - it crashes A LOT. Like every game session A LOT. A LOT - A LOT. 

Despite being well above the necessary required specs, uninstalling and reinstalling several times, running integrity checks, it just crashes constantly which is really my only complaint about the game itself. It is a beautiful survival game with an intriguing Story Mode, a challenging follow-up Amazonia mode, and basic sandbox survival. 

So until the devs finally fix some of their stability issues, just get used to saving A LOT. Get used to making TONS of day camps that you can save at regularly, and get used to losing your progress A LOT. Did i mention the crashes? *sigh*

Other minor issues are that the Amazon is the most diverse bio-regions on the planet - 1 in every 10 animals species on the planet lives within the this region - but there is nowhere near the range of diversity here or even a modest range. It needs way more birds and way more creepy crawlies - way more snakes, bullets ants, other insect varieties, some giant otters would be great - and the most glaring omission - primates. It is absolutely bizarre that there aren't any primates in this game - no spider monkeys, capuchins, howlers, or tamarins to be found. You can hear them in the audio files, but they never make an appearance which is disappointing when you make a tree house to avoid the threats on the ground (ignoring the fact that real world jaguars are incredibly adept climbers.)

I was able to finish the game in under 6 hours with building maybe 4 structures(not even base structures!) beyond some small camp fires on occasion. The other missing piece is -- horror? I assumed horror would a strong element consider its compared the Forrest and name ""Green Hell"". The story is compelling, but not scary or even really attempting to be so? It does weave in environmental storytelling in some parts of game play. [spoiler] However A lions share of the story is told through 5ish long cut scenes, and the game pushes you to those cuts scenes early. Further every cut scene you do negates any need to tend to your survival stats (as it auto bumps you to full on all meters) and forces you to be constantly on the move pulling you away from any base building or crafting.

The game can be brutally unforgiving as you would want and expect for a fairly hardcore realistic survival game. But it also is one of the most relaxing games I have played as well, with a setting that just makes me zone out and lose hours very quickly. 

The game has nice immersive tropical jungle sounds and looks great, if not exactly next-gen on the graphics. The mechanics will make sense pretty fast if you have played a few survival games in the past. Of course some mechanics will annoy here and there, the fact you get tired so fast annoyed me, but overall it is all fun and I do recommend to NOT go searching things on YouTube etc and instead find things out for yourself. 

I see comparisons to The Forest and for my two cents, this is far more engaging and enjoyable overall. The setting really helps too and it really does feel like you are at the mercy of the humid tropical environment that in some ways rewards you with easy food but then will ruin you the next minute. 

My only regret is that I got this game when I was trying to get through Diablo IV and I have a pretty awesome base in Rust I need to maintain... as I have lost interest in those games and am addicted to this game.

It takes maybe a couple hours to really get comfortable with your controls and the environment. After your first shelter is when things get a tad easier and you gain more confidence in surviving.

Die a few more times from parasites or disease, and discover which plants have medicinal properties (and pay for that knowledge with poisoning or death a few times). Survive longer, build weapons, defend yourself from enemies and predators.

Eventually, you know every food and water source, can crush every enemy, can build anything you need. You are more than a match for anything this inhospitable world might throw at you. Nature regards you with awe: you are the King of the Jungle.

Then step on a scorpion far from your camp. Your bandages with antivenom herbs are back at camp. Stumble around looking for the herb you need. Your fever rises.

Pass out on the forest floor. Wake up: parasitic worms hiding in the muddy ground have made a home under your skin. Use a bone fragment as a needle and dig them out. Pass out from the pain.

You wake up dangerously dehydrated, and your makeshift coconut canteen already drained. Making it home is your only hope. You start in the right direction, but the combination of the fever, the now infected scorpion sting, and the open sores from your impromptu worm surgery have weakened you so that you can only make it a few hundred yards in between passing out.

Your periodic unconsciousness gives more worms the opportunity to claim a new home. The fever rises. Dehydration worsens. Hunger racks your body. You hope the growl you heard was just a mouse, and not a jaguar hunting you. Irrelevant, as you pass out again.

You can make it, less than a mile to go. Medicine, food, water, fire, and rest all await you. Just a little further.

You stumble one last time, and fall to the ground. This time, you don't rise again. Throat parched, delirious with fever, body covered in wounds and sores. Your vision fades to black.

Scavengers consume your body, and the sun bleaches your bones. Nature looks with indifference over the few scattered, splintered bones that mark your final resting place.

Some minor stamina efficiency and damage increases on the skills. The real progression is in your own competence and knowledge of gathering and crafting to solve problems that arise. You're surrounded by over two dozen types of plants, but which one do you use for snake bites? Which one is for treating stomach parasites? Which mushrooms make you vomit, and which ones give you a helpful energy boost? Why did you build your first base so far away from a water source? Those kinds of things.

The resources are everywhere you turn, but knowing how and when to use them is where your ""power"" comes from. I recommend going in blind and researching solutions to problems as they come up. Try to discover common sense crafting combinations on your own, because the crafting really makes sense. Spending a few hours on the Wiki before starting would have killed the suspense and helpless panic that Green Hell does well. I enjoyed surrendering myself to that experience, learning, and trying again. If you're looking for ARK or Valheim in the rain forest, you're going to be disappointed. I'm about 20 hrs into survival mode, and it's still a constant struggle. So try to enjoy it for what it is.

The structure building system needs some tweaking, but it's the best building system I've used. Shoulder carry items are innovative, and assembling the raw materials in order gives a wonderful sense of immersion and accomplishment. Having the materials and having to jump around trying to find the perfect angle to be able to place them is annoying, especially when time is so crucial.

I wish I had checked this game out back when it was first dropped. 

If you love hardcore, punishing survival, you will love this.
If you love navigating by memory, land formations, and the sun and moon, and have an impeccable sense of direction, you will love this.
If you are on the spectrum (or aren't, even!) and enjoy repetitive tasks with a slower and more gradual progression, you will love this. 
If you loved building (or dreamed of building) multi-layered, massive tree-forts as a kid, you will love this.

Green Hell has a VERY special place in my heart. 
3 ish years ago, I was diagnosed with some lifelong and not-curable medical conditions. We also moved away from the town I'd lived 3/4's of my life. 
Being stuck in hospital beds and being mostly bedridden because of my health, I have YEARNED for the forest in my old town. 

Booting Green Hell is like being back in my childhood woods, except with no physical limitations! I can go ANYWHERE! 
Calling it ""Hell"" is so far from the truth because to me, Green Hell is a little slice of gaming Heaven. 

From the first time I played Minecraft, I fell in love with the survival genre. Starting from nothing and building your way up. It fit me like Cinderella's glass slipper! Being on the spectrum, I grew to find GREAT stress relief from the repetitive base-building mechanics in games like Minecraft, Eco, and No Man's Sky. 

But Green Hell scratches an itch I never knew I had! It takes that genre and pushes it to the very limit.

It's just man versus cold (or sweltering!), hard nature (with the occasional human attackers, of course). But the appeal of Green Hell, to me, is the realism! You learn how to start a fire with two sticks and some dry material. You fish with a spear. Waypoints? Fast travel? Forget it! You navigate by the sun, moon, and stars or by a real-life grid map (A1, B2, C3, etc.)

Green Hell doesn't throw zombies, ghosts, demons, or magic at you. It doesn't NEED to. You stepped on an anthill and you now need to find plants with antihistamine properties. Got a scratch? Better patch that up with a leaf bandage. Do you remember what plants are safe? And don't forget to wash it! You're thirsty? That river looks appealing, but you never know what parasites you might ingest without the proper treatment or filtration. 

You must balance your nutritional needs to avoid penalties. After all, everyone needs a balanced diet! Sure, you can get by with campfire steaks and boiled water, but you'll perform much better throwing some carbs and fatty nuts into the mix. 

Then, there's the graphics. Everything in the game is so beautifully detailed and varied! With my window open and the spring air blowing in, I can almost forget I'm playing a game! (This is on max settings, just for reference). 

[b]NOTE: [/b] As an aside, I run the game on a custom rig with 32G of RAM. I get an average of 75-100FPS on max settings. However, despite the game claiming a preferred 8G of RAM (4, minimum), I am unable to run it on my 12G laptop (it [u]technically[/u] runs, but at an astonishing -1 to 8 FPS on average) even at the lowest possible settings. This may be due to hardware failure with that machine, though, as it is an older machine. Yet, it did run Rimworld with 700 mods at a stable 75 FPS somehow recently, so...
If you wish to play on the best possible settings, I would highly recommend a dedicated gaming rig and 16G of RAM as a personal recommendation! 
However! If you have a lower-end or older machine, don't despair! The game is very reasonable to look at on even the lowest settings :)
It's certainly a visual treat if you're coming from games like Minecraft, Rimworld, Don't Starve, etc.

The sound is another stellar element in Green Hell! Not only is the track very cinematic and professional, but every sound is a clue to what may be lurking in the foliage. Play for long enough, and you will soon realize that your ears are your most valuable asset!

As an audiophile who composes music between health crises, I find Green Hell experimenting with the mechanics of sound [u]entirely[/u] fascinating! No previous games I have played have relied so heavily on audio as such an integral piece of game-play. Other than specific musically-themed, genres, that is. 
Kudos to the audio developers for Green Hell! 
I would love to see more audio-central survival games in the future!

Finally, Green Hell is a masterful example of storytelling! Not only do you have fun gameplay, lovely visuals, and amazing sound design, but you also get a complex story to boot! I have unfortunately not finished this story, so I can't comment how well it holds up near the end, but... It seems well-crafted this far, and the VA's are on POINT! 
Both Jake (main character) and Mia (wife of Jake) have very expressive voices. I adore their banter in the tutorial!

Personally, I think Green Hell could be selling for $60-$70 and still be worth every penny. But the fact that the developers have charged under $30 AND recently slashed the price?

Learning the controls on a gampad is brutal.
The tutorial area is so confusing.
I found the tea making thing right away and thought it was dumb. So i didnt do it. I was stuck in the starting area for ever thinking the game is dumb and small.
I thought you could only grab palm leafs one at a time.
After I finally got through the start area I spawned in and got mauled by some predator right away.
I realized I didnt save I just slept.

But when I got out of that starting area the game is awesome...

Inventory management is a pain; you need to manage weight as well as how much you can carry. Weapon and combat is a little akward; some weapons are far more effective for combat, but less effective for anything else. Crafting can sometimes be frustrating; as most patterns are stored in your book, sometimes learning them or remembering what goes where can be a pain. Or trying to place certain items when building structures is very limiting sometimes.

However, in terms of overall gameplay, story or just having fun with friends this is by far one of the most fun games I've played that's survival, crafting and hunting.

815370,138366289,76561198086758919,0,20,4772,0,3808,1698044438,"For those wondering how different this game is from the forest, here's a perspective from someone who owns both games.

The main difference is that green hell isn't a power fantasy like the forest. In the forest you can blow up mutants and cannibals with molotovs and bombs. Or use fire arrows or flares to light enemies on fire. You can also upgrade you weapons with stuff like human teeth and bird feathers to give them a stat buff. Green hell is less combat focused. You get different tiers of tools and weapons, with stone being basic tier and metal being the best tier. That's about it, you can't blow up jaguars or natives with bombs or light them up with flares.

Green hell does have tribal native people, but they are much less of a nuisance. They don't spawn often and even if they do, they won't send waves of tribals near your location. They spawn, and if they spot you and you kill them all, it won't escalate any further like things do in the forest. There are only two main types of tribal people, archers and spearmen, no Virginia mutants or cave mutants. Again, it's less focused on combat.

Enemies in the forest are all human based. In green hell, there's more variety, you get jaguars, mountain lions, caiman and other hostile animals. And these animals don't fuck around and an unprepared encounter can easily spell death. A leaf bandage will do fine against scratches but it won't do anything against a deep jaguar laceration. It depends on if you have the knowledge to treat the laceration, better yet, kill any animals before they can even harm you. That said, it takes knowledge and skill, since you all you have are spears and bow/arrows, no molotovs or bombs.

Food and water is also much deeper in green hell. You have different nutrients such as proteins, fats and carbohydrates, so eating a piece of meat won't replenish your carbohydrates, it's less like the forest where you can likely survive off a single food source. And this mechanic isn't here just for the sake of variety, failing to satisfy any one of these nutrients can lead to reduced health and stamina, which can further affect your ability to survive.

This is a good segue into stamina. Stamina in green hell is also very important, it doesn't just affect your movement and combat. If your stamina and energy fall too low, you'll pass out on the spot. This will then lead to parasitic worms living underneath your skin, rapidly draining your sanity, which if left untreated can spell another death. So to stop yourself from passing out and getting worms, you need to sleep regularly on a bed. Stamina also dictates if you can light a fire, unlike the forest, you don't have a Bic lighter with infinite fuel, you need to start a fire with a drill firestarter, which uses a substantial amount of stamina and energy. If you don't have a fire, you can't purify and boil water, or cook any raw meat you have. Foods in green hell expire quickly if you don't cook or eat them.

Next is the sound design. Green hell's sound design doesn't just sound good, it is also very very crucial to survival. In the jungle, there's an overgrowth of bushes and trees, so it's very easy to miss any threats that are around you, such as rattlesnakes, giant ass spiders, tribal people and Jaguars. The only reliable way to identify these threats is by the distinct sound in which they make. Hear a snake rattling? Stop moving any closer and go around the source of the sound. Hear the low growl of a jaguar inching closer? Get ready for an encounter. Hear the singing of tribal people? Crouch down and avoid alerting them. Because more times than not, you won't be able to see these threats. In the forest, you can turn off sound completely and still stay alive, but in green hell, turning off sound will get yourself killed by various threats.

Lastly, I want to talk about difficulty. So far I've built up green hell to be this hardcore survival game, whether it is 100% realistic or not is still debatable with sometimes questionable AI patterns, but in its core, green hell is a hardcore survival game. That said, it's actually very customizable in its difficulty. Don't want to get bit by snakes and spiders? You can actually turn it off, don't want to deal with tribal people? You can turn it off as well. Don't want to deal with sanity, there's another option for that as well. It's much more customizable than the forest. You can go in blind and get killed over and over again. But like any hardcore game, it can be very rewarding. If you want to challenge yourself or just want to play like an Amazonian tourist, you can customize the difficulty to your own liking.",1684208962,1684208962,True,353,2,0.948069214820861816,0,True,False,False

If you can accept that this game will give you few hints at the start, you're going to enjoy this game. I have never seen a game that can entertain me for 8 hours with such a small segment of the map, I've only gone as far as the first abandoned village and even that has been a challenge. The resource management is absolutely brutal, if you don't eat or drink for too long you're pretty much dead. This is a game that offers little compromise as far as base building: there are certain things that are non-negotiable. You need to make a starting hut shelter just to save your game, which is brilliant because it's basically softlocking the game until you figure out how to keep yourself alive for long enough to make a shelter. Can't make a shelter the first day? Make a leaf bed, or you'll wake up with worms under your skin with no way to remove them yet. Pass out on the ground from exhaustion? Same thing. You'll go insane before you can get the resources to fix the worms (ask me how i found that out).

It's a great game, really. Don't let the early difficulty curve scare you away, it's absolutely worth the effort and as you get secure in the resource management and ""keeping yourself not dead"" thing, the exploration seems to be a great challenge.

What this game does different than other survival games:
- The inventory system in the game limits how much you can carry quite a lot, especially in building items such as logs, mud bricks, large stones, etc. 
- The inventory system means that most bases will be built near a water source for ease of access to bricks and most bases won't be as large as you see in other games similar to this like Rust, Ark, etc. It will take you many in game nights to build what people would call a ""2x2"" on Rust.
- Food is difficult to stockpile due to lack of inventory ""space"". Having renewable food sources is tougher to get than most survival games. Fish do that quite well.
- Hydration is way tougher to manage in this game. You can't make a fire if you are tired. You also can't make a fire  if its raining unless its under a shelter you've built (or found). 
- Sleep is interesting. When it hits zero, you pass out, and will wake up with some new ""friends"" living under your skin. 
- I found myself building many ""outpost"" or ""FOB"" type bases which have: Always near water source, a roof so I can make a fire in rain, and a sleeping mat. Spread these among the map and it's really easy to explore.

Cons:
- Sadly all combat boils down to ""hit them in the head"" be it natives or some animal. As long as you aren't overwhelmed most engagements are very simple if you hit the HEAD. I think hitting the body should do way more damage
- IMO Leeches being impossible to prevent or at least lessen the occurrences gets rather annoying the more you play but maybe it is realistic

No change of heart, can't recommend the game.
------------------------------
Green Hell is .. meh :-/ . It may seems hard to speak negatively of this game since it is well realised. But, to me, the game is just not fun, so I can't recommend otherwise.
(Note: A of december 2020 - As usual for an EA, Mind the date of this review).

A few examples:
[list]
[*]Crafting: I understand there is a The-Forest-Taste in there, but that's made in a clumsy way, often even tedious. For instance, when you craft something, the game closes your inventory automatically. Fair enough, why not. I mean, that would be ok ... if crafting a single arrow did not require 5 damn clicks spent navigating within 2 different menus. Perhaps that's me, but seriously, 2 minutes stuck in the game UI to craft 10 arrows, that sucks. And the inventory management is generally like that, everything requires more clicks and more time than you'd expect. In Green Hell, you'll have to be ready tp spend a sizable portion of your in-game time starring at your inventory. That might be just me but I don't find it fun.
[*]Base building is, at best, anecdotic, because 1) There is not enough ressource and/or flat space to build a decent base like you would do in 7d2d, Conan or even The Forest 2) Building a base is actually pointless (Since you will have to progress from area to area, you'll rarely get back to your base. And anyways, you will rapidly figure out that moving from a pre-build camp to pre-build camp is the best option to go through the story. 
[*]Dying: You have no chance to survive in this game, that's bundled within the game core. But not because of some gameplay mechanics that you need to learn to get better, no, no, it's nothing about ""Git Gud"" really. It's just you'll regularly get one-shot by a scorpion, a snake or whatever random Puma. The game will then give you 1 minutes to drop your inventory on the ground (So you avoid the death penalty). And then, once respawn, you'll spend another minute to get your inventory back, one item by one item - Told you, this game is all about fun ...
[*]The ""scenario steps"": You'll have to go though painfully slow sections of the game, without any way to escape. No spoiler here, but you can guess another super fun time, quite unique to this game I must agree.
[*]Open world : Lol seriously? The map is a succession of cliff-surrounded-small-areas linked by narrow corridors. The player has no freedom whatsoever. Perhaps that's me, but I have a different definition of what is an actual ""Open World"".
[*]Body inspection mode : You walk 1 minute in the jungle and leeches will stick to you. You'll then have a menu to remove them. The menu is divided in 4 body parts, so you might have to repeat the same your manipulation 4 times. Repeat continuously throughout the game. As deliciously tedious as possible.
[*]You're caracter might become insane and will start to yell in your ears (I mean, literraly, in your real-life headset). Alright ok, unpleasant feature, but ok, why not. Though, you'll quickly figure out that a campfire is enough to recover your mental health, whatever the origin of your illness ... as long as you stand still close by, most likely waiting doing nothing - Another fun moment. Well, you might optimize boring moments though, it's certainly a good time to craft some arrows right?
[/list]

I don't know if the #TeamRealistic is right, perhaps the game is closely reflecting reality (Perhaps, if we assume that becoming mad in a day because of a leech is realitic) - I mean, I don't know, I never visited Amazonia. What I know for sure however, is that ""realistic"" have never helped any game to be fun. At least, it didn't help Green Hell.

I have also engaged with the likes of the locals of North Sentinal Island and if i do say, this game delivered a plundersum view of what its like to try and survive an endeering time in a strugglesum environment.

So I decided to check out survival get the game down and started the story line with my boyfriend.....I will try to review this without any spoilers...but AMAZING job on story line, like I had NO CLUE what was going on, why i was there or how i even got there or if what i was being told was even true..at first I really hated Mia's character lol because I thought she was being a selfish lil b* hahah awe poor mia <3 anyways I really can't wait to play the second part I'm fully invested now. That says alot because I usually don't care for the story line at all, but this one, this one is a gem for sure. There's much I'd love to see added to the game but I'll save that for the forums.

The story is delivered using mechanics similar to Firewatch, where the main character tries to uncover a mystery, while in radio contact with his S.O., all while struggling to survive. The story itself revolves around indigenous medicine. On a personal note, my life was literally saved by a sacred fungus commonly known as ""magic mushrooms""; for me, all other avenues of ""modern medicine"" failed. 

However, there is a lot of anger from indigenous tribes, at those who share this sacred knowledge, as well as the westerners who exploit it. As Western civilization takes greater interest in the tribes, the tribes are either assimilated or decimated, and their cultural heritage is lost. As the game portrays, the only tribes that have survived are aggressively hostile towards outsiders. There is a lot to learn and a lot to gain from all indigenous people, but simply contacting them, writing about them, sharing with them destroys what we love most about them. 

So what do we do? I don't know. I wouldn't trade my psychedelic experience for anything. I wish I could live like the tribesmen, in touch with nature, away from modern culture. But what has happened to their culture and their heritage is just... so sad. It's worth saving, but how? And what human would forgo saving their life or the lives of their loved-ones, to keep a culture untainted? Even if you make such a moral stand, others won't, so would you be sacrificing your loved ones for nothing?

This game has no business being this good.

I tried liking this game, I really did.  I've been a fan of survival games for many years.  But I just couldn't enjoy this.
Although the graphics are nice, the good stops there for me.
It gets boring very fast, and has nothing special to offer really. And all the small annoyances gets really frustrating.  The day goes by way too fast, you can die from an infection within one day, the inventory system is frustrating and unnecessarily complex, the voice dialogue is really bad, the story is weird, the animals are dumb, calorie intake is too high, carrying 1 gram more than allowed slows your walking speed down to 1 m per day, a fair amount of bugs with getting stuck, loosing items, clipping through the floor etc...,
A real cesspool of unfair features that makes everything annoying.

So many games try to jump on this survival genre and hype it up with fantastic trailers, good graphics and well performed marketing. But then fail miserably with the execution which is just a bad copy of a different game.

The same goes for keeping your character fed and watered - 4 different food meters to keep topped up.  90% of your time is spent just looking for nuts to eat or for that one particular plant to treat an infection before you die in less than an hour.

I picked this one up way back in Early Access when the story wasn't even finished yet, shelved it for a while, and just came back recently. The game has really come a long way and manages to captivate me in a way that other survival games just don't do. The story is great and definitely what sets it apart in the genre but more often than not I find myself just enjoying hanging out in the world, completely forgetting that I'm supposed to actually be doing something. Not only is the environment gorgeous, it's teeming with life instead of feeling like a bunch of empty space in between important areas.

The world is dangerous and frankly pretty frustrating at first, but that same quality also gives you a real sense of accomplishment as you learn how to deal with it. You'll go from dying within 2 days to barely clinging to life for a week before dying, then barely clinging to life for two weeks before dying, then something clicks and you're able to barely cling to life indefinitely as long as you don't do something stupid. Your mastery of the world improves and eventually you find yourself in good enough shape to be able really start exploring, taking risks, and progressing the story...which is when the real game begins and that's something I don't want to spoil.

All that said, nobody's perfect. Dropped items get lost under bushes or just fall through the ground. The UI design often favors immersion over convenience, requiring you to flip through notebook pages one by one to find the building you want or rearrange your entire inventory so you can pick up a rock. It's better than it used to be and it's certainly no worse than many other games, but it does frustrate at times. Of course, one could say it's quite realistic to be frantically flipping through your notes trying to find that one thing you need to not die :)  Haven't tried multiplayer myself but plenty of other reviews detail the issues people have run into, so that's something to be aware of if co-op is your jam.

If you want a survival game that's super streamlined and basically just about making base get bigger and number go up, then this game probably isn't for you. If you're looking for a survival game whose world demands you pay attention to it, where survival is never a trivial task no matter how much you learn or how many resources you gather, that really compels you to explore deeper and figure out what the hell is going on in its weird story...well, this might be right up your alley. Just remember no step on snek.

*UPDATE 4/23/2023* Finished the main story, now working on Spirits of Amazonia and loving it even more. I've even been dipping into multiplayer a bit (still no dedicated servers for better or worse, if that's something you care about) and been having a blast with that as well.

The tutorial is not sufficient, if you try to play the game without tutorial you will not figure it out in 2 hours. Which means you will not be able to refund it, after dying twenty times in a row on the easiest difficulty. The game fails to spawn the tools necessary to survive initially, for example you need to drink water from a coconut. There are no coconuts anywhere, the coconut is a lie.

It is simply money out of your pockets and a bad experience.

Also the developer has purchased 1/3 of all sales of the game to boost their sales numbers.

In terms of core gameplay, this game is interesting as it's a survival game where the focus is truly on survival. Most other survival games I've played, the survival mechanism is only really a factor for the first few hours, then you build a settlement and focus on upgrades and exploration and the survival mechanisms just become an annoyance. In this game survival is the heart and sole, and you never get past that. There are no upgrades to save you. You're always at risk of things like infection, and food is always limited. It's also impressive the degree to which the survival is simulated. Like with the several types of infections, or how you have to search your body for leeches. 

The real star of this game though is the single player story. Hit me harder than any other game I've played. I think it's because of the way the story is told. It's told through narration over still/freezeframe scenes that you can walk through. I guess this was done as a cost savings measure, because animation is expensive, but it really punches up the emotional impact. It feels more like an experience as you walk around the still scene, picking out small details as you hear the emotional narration. It's unlike anything else. 

You should play this game and play through the full single player campaign(core game). Everyone should.",1682213691,1682213691,True,1,0,0.514170050621032715,0,True,False,False

The game is marketed as a realistic survival crafting game, but it has invisible walls which stops your movement; climbing ropes that you can't climb until eating a granola bar; 95% of coconut trees don't have even a single coconut on them; trees that cannot be chopped down and logs on the ground that can't be harvested either; ground areas that are completely clear yet can't be build upon; animals that can't be skinned despite having a machete in your hand; and it's possible to carry 6 huge palm leaves but you cannot carry 1 palm leaf together with another type of leaf... I guess the two different types of palm leaves hate eachother? Makes sense...

This game isn't a 'realistic survival crafting game'... it's just a 'survival crafting game'. For every 'realistic' mechanic that the game boasts, there's 2 other unrealistic mechanics at work as well. If you enjoy being punished, then you'll enjoy this game, but don't buy into the fact that the game is realistic or even logical in its game mechanics and design, because it isn't.

Also, the regional pricing for the game is really bad in the 3rd world, which for me on principle alone is reason enough to not support the devs.

You also spend a lot of time hunting things but those jaguars you kill won't let you craft any jaguar skin armours. In fact, leather isn't even part of the game.

For that magical first play, that is always best in survival games, I configured the game to provide authentic Robinsonade experience. I disabled the natives and big predators, while focusing on battling the elements and treating the occassional snakebite. I had an absolute blast. Crafting, hunting, rationing water, building my own house, transforming an area, slowly becoming more and more comfortable in the game world. This is the strength of Green Hell, it gives you a fantastic playground without the jaded zombie hordes or super-predictable supernatural elements found in other games. That one playthrough I got my money's worth tenfold.

Then I tried the story mode and the world fell apart. I won't spoil anything, but the game couldn't rise above the ""obtain X for it is the only way you can reach Y where you can obtain Z for its the only way..."" repeating ad nauseam. New areas are walled by artificial-looking cliffs where there is juuuust one narrow path through, magically requiring you to use the latest-acquired thing and only that. You'll never look the same way on the game world again. By the time I write this I reached map 3 and I'm not sure I care enough about the story to actually finish it. It does the otherwise great game a disservice, goes against the very premise that sets it apart from the competition.

Still, I recommend the game. Just stay away from story mode and internet sources, take the time to find recipes and buildings on your own. Logical thinking will get you far and I especially like how more advanced stuff actually makes your in-game life easier.

-Terrible, inconvenient crafting and inventory management systems. Every step of every interaction involves five unnecessary clicks while you open and close different windows. Need to make a bandage for that cut on your arm? Open the inspect window to select your arm, open the crafting window to create a bandage, open the inventory, sort to one of the five screens holding your crafting items, move the leaf from your backpack to your crafting table, craft it, move it back again, move medicine in with it, craft it again, close the window, reopen the inspect window, locate the cut on your arm again, then place the bandage on that exact spot. Moving a stack of items from your inventory to storage? Open storage, open inventory, sort to the correct inventory screen, individually move every item in the stack from one screen to the exact spot you want on the other screen. Every interaction in the game is filled with unnecessary opening, closing, picking up, putting down, holding the correct button to access an unrelated submenu, etc.
-Constant desyncs in co-op where you and your partner have different items, different plants, different rocks, and different aggro enemies on screen in different places. You can only interact with/attack the things that the game decides to render on your side. It's like playing two different games side by side.
-Awful ""George, no one speaks like this"" writing for both main characters
-The kind of stilted line reads that you can only get from a polish studio doing bilingual english/spanish characters

Again, avoiding spoilers, I recommend everyone to at least try this game once, I've personally only racked up so many hours by forcing this onto my sister, so a lot of the enjoyment just came from us being together, and not specifically the game itself. That's not a knock on the game itself though, I do seriously enjoy it.

Avoiding spoilers; I find too much of the game itself is limited - especially in regards to the combat, building and just overall replay time. I NEVER find myself (not since I first got it maybe 2 years ago) with the urge to play this game unless my sister is online, but when I do, or when they update stuff, I devote a good 10-20 hours per week. 

It's just frustrating how I want this game to have so much more, like furniture, defensive walls, paddle boats, Mayan armor/colonial Spanish armor and the ability to build anywhere, but we don't have that. At least not yet.

But still, I had 43 hours in this by myself before my sister started, and I did enjoy those moments, so I keep this game installed and continue to play it, just like I encourage other people to play it.

Had a 5 hours long session today where i was listening to a podcast at the same time. Slept multiple times, although did not save manually as i constantly forgot about it. Then as i was in need of a singular bamboo stick for my water purifier i decided to head out to find some bamboo. 
I had apparently forgotten that all my bandages were used except my lily and tobacco ones.

So naturally, a puma jumped me. It scratched me once, i then killed it with a single arrow to the head, saw i was out of bandages, then bled out and died while looking for more. Woke up 5 hours earlier, in my old base.

It is just repetitive work. Does not make me relax instead it is a game which tenses me up so much I dont want to play it. It is a very sadistic game.

The fundamentals are not firmly rooted and you are releasing so many features. It is a pain in the ass to collect nuts, collect fruits, get meat, craft bandages,  avoid snakes, avoid leeches by observing the environment. I cannot explore at all. I actually feel stuck. Like what kind of mc literally gets hungry in game like in real life, the time difference is too large, in game time passes faster. It is not like there is a passive skill set I can level up to decrease the hunger usage bar or a passive skill set to detect snakes before I enter the bush, there is no passive skills, the skills are the gamer themselves, that is not immersive, that is HELL.

I really dont want to spend my time in hell, I thought the game title did not seriously mean that you drop me in a jungle with leeches and snakes and carnivores with an obsessive need to craft tools that have durability and maintain my hunger and watch out for the rain and watch out for snakes and leeches, make sure to eat nuts, fruits and meat every like 15mins.

I could play this game for the rest of my life and never get bored. DEFINITELY Play story mode before you play Spirits Of The Amazonia, it will make your experience a dream. The story in this game is my favorite story of all time as it is almost 100% realistic. This game has a lot of things beat over The Forest which makes it this close. Find a friend that will play a lot with you as there is tons of things to do. Its all up to your imagination. There is tons of maps and locations that make this game better. Once you start Play SOTA the story will hit you hard. I could on forever on how i love this game. They are still updating and adding crucial things to this game, and i look forward for any new huge updates or possibly new games coming in the future. If you want a good experience and to have a good time, please play this game. I can almost guarantee, you will not be disappointed.

Here, I'm gonna talk about both green hell VR (bought it on quest 2) and green hell flatscreen. I'll say pros and cons of both.

~~GREEN HELL (FLATSCREEN)~~
PROS:
Green hell's graphics are definitely top notch. It looks stunning for a game from 4 years ago.
EXTREMELY immersive. This game really just throws you in. It's extremely realistic. Playing this game really makes you evolve as a survivalist. Many modern survival games don't immerse you like the way green hell does.
The realism is very high. There's a lot of detail and little tiny things that go a long way in a game like this.
The mechanics are really fun. Spear fishing, crafting, cooking, fishing, everything. Something that i've always thought of while playing survival games is ""Why the hell am I not able to do that? Couldn't I just do this?"" Green hell sort've fixes this problem pretty well. Like the harvest mechanic. A really simple thing that goes a long way. Many survival games just don't allow you to do something like that. Or atleast the ones I've played.
Weirdly enough? The physics are really good. Yes i agree. cutting down a tree doesn't look right at all. But when logs fall or you drop things onto the floor/on top of things they work the way you'd expect them to. If i drop a stick onto the floor, on top of a few more sticks, they dont clip and bounce around like you'd expect them to. They do what you think they'd do and just stack. or fall over of course. nothing flies out of control or clips through the floor. never.
Base building is fun!
the inventory management system is something i really really enjoy. It's a close cousin to our favorite inventory management system from the early 2000s, RE4!
open world? Oh its great. Beautiful.

CONS
Christ this games entities always clip into leaves and trees a little too often. And their animations are very janky. It's not a complete immersion breaker but this is where I really see it and go ""Yeah this game's old...""
Every animation is a bit primitive. But it's really not that big of a deal. I can let this one slide because this game *is* 4 years old.
Its almost completely different from the VR version. Things you could do in VR are usually completely different. like a reinforced ax isn't unlocked until later in the game.
Might be a skill issue, but its hard...

MY OPINION:
Green hell is the best survival game. Just in general. I know the cons make it seem a little bad but you WILL love the intense survival experience if you love games like ""the forest"". This game is still wonderful after 4 years. And really? If they decide to take a bit of their time to fix nooks and crannies, It'll become the greatest survival game of all time. Its intensity and difficulty just makes it so much more better.

~~GREEN HELL (VIRTUAL REALITY EDITION!)~~

PROS
I love that the hallucination feature was implemented into VR. and very well!
Everything from green hell flatscreen translates very well into green hell VR. The crafting was also very beautifully made. The feeling of wrapping a rope around an axe to make it stronger. physically using objects to nail logs into the ground to make pillars for bases. Just wonderful.
the physics is also still advanced. and the graphics are still beautiful. They made the VR version really well. and everything good from the first game is put into here. 

CONS:
that jankiness wasn't fixed here. bummer.
there is no complex base building in the vr version :(

Put it down out of frustration. 

Came back to it a few days ago, and tried again as i was stuck for what to play.

Got decent at it, and finally played through the story. 

Mind you i did play my story run with tribe members and predators off. 
But still glad i did, as honestly i was not expecting the story to go the way it did, and i found it really well put together. 

Looking forward to the overhauls that are road mapped, once they come out, i look forward to trying again, but with dangers back on.

THE GAME'S VISUALS ARE PRETTY DARN GOOD, WITH LOTS OF LUSH JUNGLE FOLIAGE AND DETAILED CHARACTER MODELS. YOU'LL FEEL LIKE YOU'RE REALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AMAZONIAN RAINFOREST.

THE GAMEPLAY IS PRETTY SOLID TOO. YOU'LL HAVE TO MANAGE YOUR HUNGER, THIRST, AND HEALTH WHILE ALSO CRAFTING TOOLS AND BUILDING SHELTER. THERE'S A LEARNING CURVE TO IT, BUT IT'S NOT TOO STEEP.

BUT WHAT REALLY MAKES GREEN HELL STAND OUT IS ITS STORY MODE. IT'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL SURVIVAL GAME WHERE YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. INSTEAD, YOU'RE FOLLOWING A STORY OF A MAN WHO'S LOST IN THE JUNGLE AND TRYING TO FIND HIS WAY BACK TO CIVILIZATION.

THE STORY MODE ADDS A NEW LAYER OF INTEREST TO THE GAME, AND IT'S NICE TO HAVE A GOAL TO WORK TOWARDS BESIDES JUST SURVIVING.

THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE WITH GREEN HELL IS THAT IT CAN GET REPETITIVE AFTER A WHILE. ONCE YOU'VE MASTERED THE BASICS OF SURVIVAL, THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH TO DO BESIDES EXPLORE THE JUNGLE AND CRAFT NEW THINGS.

OVERALL, GREEN HELL IS A SOLID SURVIVAL GAME WITH A UNIQUE STORY MODE. IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH A PLAYTHROUGH IF YOU'RE INTO THIS KIND OF GAME, BUT IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE THE GAME FOR YA.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him in the online mode. loaded into the game, made my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

It's a game that will test your limits and push you to the brink of madness, but it's also an exhilarating experience. Let's take a closer look at the pros and cons of this intense game:

Pros:
[list]
[*]The game's graphics are stunning, with lush and detailed environments that transport you deep into the heart of the Amazon. It's a visual feast that will leave you in awe.
[*]The game's survival mechanics are challenging and rewarding, with a variety of tasks to keep you engaged. From building shelters to hunting for food, there's always something to do in Green Hell.
[*]The game's realism is impressive, with realistic depictions of hunger, disease, and mental health. It's a game that doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of survival.
[*]The game's sense of tension and dread is palpable, as danger lurks around every corner. Every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*]The game's difficulty level can be overwhelming, especially for those who are new to survival games. You'll need to be strategic and resourceful to survive, and even then, some aspects of the game can feel unfair or unforgiving.
[*]The game can be quite time-consuming, especially if you're trying to progress quickly. Building and surviving take time, so if you're looking for a quick fix, Green Hell might not be the game for you.
[*]The game's combat system can be a bit clunky and unresponsive at times, which can be frustrating in high-pressure situations.
[/list]

Overall, Green Hell is an intense and immersive game that's not for the faint of heart. With its stunning graphics, challenging survival mechanics, and realistic depictions of survival in the wild, it's a game that's worth playing.

It's probably one of the hardest and most unforgiving games I've ever played, where you'll make a lot of mistakes if you want to survive in the middle of the jungle that will kill you, over and over and over, until you learn how to survive. It might sound stressful, and it is! But this is also where the game shines and what it's all about. When you finally get the hang of it, and you know how to make a shelter, make a campfire, make a weapon, and go out hunting for food in the middle of a tropical rain without getting worms or infections while a jaguar is nearby. That's when you become the true survivalist.

The crafting in this game is genius, where you have a backpack for all your stuff, and you have to make sure everything is there and packed effectively. The game offers many crafting buildings and a few weapons. The combat system might not be the best and it feels a bit sluggish at times. But the main story and atmosphere are brilliant and you really feel like you are living in the wilderness.

The only real criticism of this game is that you can spend hours exploring and getting lost. So, make sure you take your time and explore the jungle in a strategic way.

Players must navigate the harsh wilderness, gather resources, build shelter, and fend off wildlife to survive. One of the game's greatest strengths is its attention to detail. The lush and vibrant environment is stunningly beautiful, with dense foliage and wildlife that make the world feel alive. The game's sound design is also excellent, with realistic animal noises and atmospheric music that enhance the immersive experience. The game's survival mechanics are challenging and engaging. Players must monitor their hunger, thirst, and health, as well as deal with environmental hazards such as diseases and infections. The game also offers a crafting system that allows players to create tools and equipment to aid in their survival. The game's story is also well-done, with a well-written and engaging narrative that keeps players invested in the game's world. The game's characters are interesting and well-developed, and the game's twists and turns keep players on the edge of their seat. However, one of the game's few downsides is its lack of variety. While the game's survival mechanics and story are engaging, there is only so much players can do in the limited environment. Once players have built their shelter and gathered their resources, the game can become repetitive.  Green Hell is an excellent survival game that offers a beautiful and immersive experience. Its attention to detail, challenging survival mechanics, and engaging story make it a must-play for fans of the genre.

I want to like this game, I've followed it for years. I finally caved, bought it on sale and started playing. I understand the game is support to be difficult, but it's just not set up well to ease a player into the experience. On difficult level 2 (1 being the easiest), I spent 4 hours looking for a goddamn coconut. Instead, I found leeches, parasites, jaguars, poisonous snakes and spiders. I watched YT videos and went on reddit; apparently coconuts are supposed to spawn on the ground as well as in trees where the can be knocked down. 4 hours, no goddamn coconuts in sight. Game is just.... so much jank, I can't recommend.

Second Review:
I uninstalled the game out of frustration. Didn't plan to come back to it... went to bed, and the next morning... thought ""Surely it's possible to survive beyond 5 hours..surely I can do it"". I found that nice ledge on the cliff of the starting area, loaded it with traps. Still cannot find enough goddamn coconuts to save my life. But now I have a mud house with 6 arrow traps for the damn wakandan invaders that keep trying to break my fragile home. Why do they hate me so much? They stole my girlfriend and yet want to ruin my life? I can only imagine the terrible things they're doing to her.. it fuels my rage. I am hunting them now. I considered eating their meat but I don't want to lower myselves to their cannibalistic ways. I'll edit this review once I sandpeople their village. And I haven't forgotten about that jaguar... I'm gonna eat KITTY TONIGHT! If I can find some goddamn coconuts.",1679947448,1680196523,True,0,0,0.414781302213668823,0,True,False,False

The Sanity feature is very realistic, perhaps nearly too much so but it adds a whole new dynamic to survival that is both fun and greatly intimidating at times. 

Watch your back for the big cats; they are jerks and will prowl out of nothing on you; if you are good with a bow a well placed shot to the face will net you some good quality meat and bones to help keep you in food and such for awhile (I recommend making soups out of it for the extra hydration value) but they are a dangerous threat in the jungle and can ruin your day and your save if you aren't careful and wary; then again they arguably are not as bad as the natives that sneak up and attempt to wreck your house.",1680190827,1680190827,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I finished the base game and Spirits of the Amazon but it misses so much potential due to lack of polishing.
It's exciting to survive and every mistake is punishing. You can even spend 80 hours in the game and you'll still miss most of the useful recipes as they have to be figured out with no in-game hints. The game had it's good moments with no hand holding but in the end the journey was way too prolonged.

Frustrating things:
- Spawning of things. Enemies can spawn next to you and you'll be bleeding without a chance of reaction. Items pop in the air and fall to ground and the whole spawning system can just crash without notice and you'll see no enemies unless you reboot the game. Truly breaks the immersion of being in a jungle.
- Base building is not encouraged but only for fun. You constantly need to move around multiple maps. Every map offers the same difficulty level so there's no need to fall back to recover and prepare for ""going deeper"" in the jungle. Building a house is just a waste of time.
- Leeches stick to your skin through armor. Enjoy taking off every single armor piece into your, oh, full inventory, just to pick the leeches off every single time.
- Reputation grind in the DLC. You can't even grind them as you need to finish 80% of _everything_ there's available. You need to practically do every possible quest you encounter and google out specific positions you have missed as just wandering around all areas three times is not enough. No reputation is given for killing evil villagers. You can't even prepare nice gifts or do repeatable deeds for the villages. Just hard coded quests. I believe most players give up with the game with the reputation grind. I would lower the requirements to 50% of everything there's to do at least.
- Quest markers can be bugged on your map. You can for example see a spot to investigate when there's actually nothing there.
- All cut scene videos are played at maximum volume. Prepare your ears.
- Fishing is tedious and useless compared to gaining normal animal meat.
- Quite a few useless items to be found which have no use for crafting of anything.

Different game modes, well customizable. Soundtrack not perfect but nevertheless cleanly implemented. Negative: Base building is a bit annoying. If the frame partially protrudes into the ground, it cannot be built because the component must be visible. That's why you often have to jump in the air to attach modules. Some logic errors. Some things have to be picked up once before you can make anything with them. It also rains under a roof. Recognition of collectible items is poorly implemented. Sometimes you have to look in a different direction to be able to collect items. A lot of things have to be read up on, since not everything is explained in the game. The collision of the environment does not match the graphical implementation. Rocks are higher than visible with it. You are constantly stuck somewhere.

The game is challenging, but it's also incredibly rewarding, offering players a chance to test their survival skills and push themselves to their limits.

One of the standout features of Green Hell is its realism. The game's world is richly detailed, with a variety of flora and fauna that feels authentic and believable. The game's visuals are impressive, with detailed character models and environments that make you feel like you're truly in the heart of the Amazon.

The survival mechanics in Green Hell are also top-notch. Players must manage their hunger, thirst, and health while avoiding dangerous wildlife and hostile tribes. The game's crafting system is also well-implemented, allowing players to create tools and weapons from natural materials found in the rainforest.

But perhaps the most impressive aspect of Green Hell is its storytelling. The game's narrative unfolds through the player's interactions with the environment and through the player's own survival story. The game's story is engaging, and it draws you in, making you feel like you're a part of the game's world.

Overall, Green Hell is an excellent game that offers a unique and immersive survival experience. The game's realism, survival mechanics, and storytelling are all top-notch, making it a must-play for fans of the survival genre.

The jungle is breathtaking and pretty deadly if you just sprint around like an idiot. Learning plants & herbs by naming them yourself is cool, especially because it is really important for survival to know what does what.

Interaction is super intuitive (like the Forest) but somewhat annoying having to drag things from left to right. Playing with controller is very doable but also a bit tedious ( I would love a button to put something from backpack into whatever you're putting it, instead of dragging it on it manually ). However, it all adds to the charm of the game.

I think the best way I can explain what really ruined this game for us is to compare it to reloading guns.

In real life, when you reload a gun, if you pop out the clip and pop in a new one, you lose any remaining ammo in the old clip, it's just gone.  OR, you have to individually finger one bullet at a time into the clip.

In games, this is not a fun experience for a vast majority of players so reloading just automatically handles your ammo and you don't lose any (in most games).

In this game, you have to maintain 4 different meters between different types of nutrients from food, water, sleep, etc.   It's just not fun to eat some meat you recently cooked only to have to go find more food of a different type to fill different meters.

So, most games just have you eat ANY type of food to fill your hunger meter rather than have to ensure you have a balanced diet, because trying to eat a balanced diet in real life isn't terribly enjoyable let along doing it in a VIDEO GAME.

I don't think the game is ""broken"" I just think it is fundamentally designed in a way that is not enjoyable for us.  On top of that, there was little reason to build a ""home"" of any scale with all the cool new building options considering you just run around and do story missions and have no real need to build a base.  

And, if you did build a base, running all the way home to refill meters and sleep, just means that by the time you run back out to your mission spot, your meters are going to be drained and you'll just have to run home again.  OR, you forage for food and make a quick fire randomly in the jungle defeating the purpose of building a home!

(To be fair, this issue is exactly the same with the new Sons of the Forest release.... we built a basic base, then ran around doing the story and never once had a reason to go back home until entire game was finished...) 

Original Review:

Nope.  Simple as that.   Unfortunately steam's relatively nice 2-hour refund window doesn't help when you have games like this that typically take a few hours to ""figure out"" what you're doing and see if you like it or not.

I'll summarize why I would not recommend this game to anyone:

1) You spend a vast majority of your time fighting to fill 5 meters (3 types of food, water, and energy/sleep).  Filling these meters drain them so by time you've in a good place, you need to sleep, which then drains the meters while you sleep.

2) The AI for both the tribe humans and Predator creatures is beyond stupid.  Very quickly you'll figure out how to fight all of these without any trouble (unless you're almost dead already).  Predator is the most annoying as it seems almost random and either scratches you causing more annoyance or you easily kill it and leave it to rot because what are you going to do with food that goes bad right away and you can't cook without putting in a lot of effort?

3) Building at first seems interesting, you have to put each and every individual part of each thing on the blueprint.  Each log, stick, branch, and rope tie.   But this quickly becomes a chore.  You can carry 3 large logs and most things take 4+ easily.  Trees typically give 2-4 per cutting them down. 

4) Initially farming out the 3 food types (Carbs, Protein, Fats) seems interesting but quickly becomes annoying.  Eventually you can build a decent ""supply"" of each but most of them don't transport so going out to explore you'll basically be fighting all of these bars the entire time.  Very annoying.  By far the worst of this type of system I've experienced.

5) Movement feels pretty bad if I'm being entirely honest.  You get used to it after a while but you'll still find yourself getting stuck constantly on random sticks, rocks, trying to walk on fallen trees and hitting ""invisible walls"" that can push you off.

I've put off playing this because a lot of reviews and comments suggested it was trying to be a hardcore experience but ultimately ended up being a more frustrating experience.   I think the developers and the hardcore fans will try to force a narrative that the game is ""hardcore"" and confuse difficulty with annoyance.   

Elden Ring (or Souls style games) are often considered very difficult (which is frustrating to many).  But Soul's style games typically have very complex combat with ""perfect"" timing needed.   This game has no perfect timing and has stupid AI.  This game has 5 meters you have to constantly fight and they don't offer many tools to improve that over time.  Drying meet extends the life of the food for a few days, but takes several days to dry.   You can grow fruit, to fill one of the bars but can't take it with you since it goes bad so fast.",1675185369,1679355105,False,5,0,0.49953228235244751,3,True,False,False

[h1]The good stuff[/h1]
A good survival game which has a challenging survial depth. You have to:
- manage hunger with 3 different sub-categories
- manage thirst
- manage sanity
- manage tools with durability
- manage health with different sub-categories
- manage food/consumables with different expiration dates

There is a vast flora and fauna (however, not so much in the story mode but in the ""Spirits of Amazonia"" game mode). The fauna has various predators that are trying to kill you.

There are also natives that are not so happy about your presence in the woods.

It also has a good craft and build system.

The story mode is interesting and has a cool concept.

I would generally suggest playing the ""Spirits of Amazonia"" game mode, which has the most stuff.
I.e. it further introduces tribes (enemies and friends).

[h1]The bad stuff[/h1]
I bought the game during its early access state. During this phase bugs and some weird behaviour were expected.

However, the game is no longer early access and considered a finished game.

Well... it is maybe finished, but it has a lot of stuff that need to be fixed and addressed. IMO this is not a finished game.

Stuff that needs to be changed:
- [b]Issue 1[/b] At the end of the story mode the game crashes and the achievements for finishing the game will not be distributed
- [b]Issue 2[/b] Saving must be done manually, which is generally fine. However, in a story mode I expect some assistence from the game, espacially before cut scenes.
- [b]Issue 3[/b] A pile of logs and sticks will clip through the ground making weird water noises
- [b]Multiplayer Issue 1[/b] game states of both players are only synced and saved, when saving manually. Meaning if someone crashed (which can happen during a multiplayer session, duh) the player who lost connection will be resetted.
- [b]Multiplayer Issue 2[/b] sometimes when accessing the bow you will get stuck in the ""bow state"". Changing weapons or opening the inventory is no longer possible. This means the other player must quickly setup a camp to save, due to [i]Multiplayer Issue 1[/i]
- [b]Multiplayer Issue 3[/b] when one player is too far away from the host, he will loose connection. Which sucks due to [i]Multiplayer Issue 1[/i]",1679262426,1679262838,False,11,2,0.596944570541381836,3,True,False,False

I tried to get into this game while waiting to play Sons of the Forest. I really wanted to like this game, I love most survival games. This one felt like work.

But lord, I have never spent 30 minutes in a survival game trying to find the correct size of rock to complete a campfire. 

Check this. This dude needs a well balanced meal according to his fitness apps, and if you don't get it just right he comes down with a bad case of Sudden Onset Narcolepsy. This guy will only be able to spend 5 minutes awake unless you get him the choicest of meats and fruits. And if you pass out, well, prepare your arms for worms because YOU GONNA GET SOME WORMS. Apparently the Amazon is infested with trillions of arm biters just waiting below the surface for some dude who missed his afternoon banana.

I spent 30 minutes in a state of aimlessly wondering around the jungle looking for a single solitary bush that grows Bandage Leaves™️ so I could patch up the wounds from taking out my arm worms and realized I hadn't had fun for hours. Sure I could go back to my base and get all that stuff, but after peeling away my 5000th leech and realizing if I did that I would have to:

- spend 20 minutes walking back to base
- peel off 10 more leeches (in a ""Self Inspect"" mode that loses its appeal <20h in)
- get to base
- fall asleep
- spend 15 minutes getting my nutrition in order (+ travel snacks)
- and finally, another 20 minutes to come back where I was if NOTHING went awry

... or, I could just.... not.",1678523600,1678523659,False,83,39,0.668749868869781494,0,True,False,False

You fall 5 feet scrape your knee and die from infection in 5 hours. You sleep on the ground get 2 worms and day 1 you die from infection. I understand making infection something that can kill you and I am all for it. However infection should take days not hours to kill you. I can barely get up a tent before my character dies from these little scrapes and bruises let alone face off against any predators. How about we make the game playable by not having your character die after you have a scraped knee for 5 hours. Yet if you want to build anything resembling a house it will take you about a week to make a shed with how long it takes to do anything when you are having to micro manage every scrape, bump, and nutrition element. I love that they try to make you need fats, carbs, and protein. However if you cannot find one of the 3 in your first 3 days out there you need to take 2 full sleep cycles to get through the day and lose tons of time. Building any type of base is out of the question you spend 95% of your time just getting your needs met. The graphics and immersive quality of the game is there though, it has potential but they need to give you some time to progress and not just have to micro manage so many things at once.

Three full games' worth of content, tree houses, animal handling, it's pretty cool. The gameplay loop issue I had is definitely feeling a lot more expanded. They're doing some real cool stuff with it, throwing obstacles in my way that I definitely didn't expect, like a poisoned river and headshot-immune boss type enemies that blast you back 20 feet per swing. I'm having fun with the game all over again. My only criticisms with the game are constructive in nature only, like a minor graphical bug where statblocks of items overlap, and there not really being a way to figure out where legends are without looking up a guide or dumb luck in exploration. I still haven't been able to figure out treehouses or animal handling on my own, but the fun is in experimentation, I guess.

Creepy Jar, if you see this, know that I see your love that you put into this game. I wouldn't have continued playing if I didn't feel the love. You made a banger, and it's only got better since release. That said, here's some improvement suggestions because your survey was very limiting in responses:
1) Please make the ""drink the poisoned water,"" button and the ""remove the poison from the water,"" button a different command. Sneezing should not be the difference between an objective and losing your 100+ hour permadeath save file to food poisoning. Jake has no survival instinct that prevents him from drinking the poison? Come on, guys. That's an easy quality of life improvement. 
2) A way to draw on the map would be great. I can make charcoal sustainably on demand. Let me use it to mark my bases and possible building sites, make a to-do list, things like that. If I have to spend charcoal to do that, then all the better - that's immersion right there.
3) Needing to get a bamboo stick for a mud water filter is understandable, but annoying when I have no idea where the bamboo is. Some indicator, maybe different shades of green on the map or something, to identify where bamboo groves are would be really beneficial.
4) If I start a new survival game where I just want to zen out on easy mode and build a full base like it's Sim City, I should be able to. I don't want to have to explore the entire jungle to get all the recipes just to experiment and build in a sandbox mode. I'm hesitant to experiment on my permadeath save file of course, but that's the only one I have where I have a full notebook.
5) The leech picking minigame is just plain annoying after a while. I've spent many hours in SoA at this point, and it's just annoying when I have to check every limb YET AGAIN. Let me get a recipe for a repellent salve, maybe whatever armor I'm wearing + ayahuasca berries or vines (giving them a use in survival mode since they're pretty useless there) or give me some way to edit the game's settings to turn them off. They don't even do that much to my sanity, they're inconsequential. Why not take this idea a step further and have armor modifications that give at least a small % chance to prevent snakebites, prevent rashes from hornets, prevent leeches? Maybe we do ayahuasca and get a token of some kind that lets us ""enchant,"" our armor?
6) Fires attract predators and native goon squads. I get it. But I sure would love a way to signal to those natives that it's on sight, and I will make armor and soup out of their bones with no sanity penalty. I put rush delivery on arrows straight to the dome, same-day shipping straight to the ancestors. Let me build some kind of totem like they build, something that lets the natives know that I am the sole cause of depopulation in their villages with my confirmed body count.
7) I'm sick of chopping trees. Let me grow trees in the planting boxes or something, and let them feed sticks and logs and whatever into a set of stands automatically. Having to go chop the 9 millionth tree to build my base sucks, I'm ready for jungle automation.

Much love, devs.

---------------------------

Game's dope. But severely lacking an autosave feature. I'm not talking about Skyrim, where like every 5 seconds you get a safety save. I'm talking about major storyline events. When I drink ayahuasca, wake up and run straight into a goddamn gator and get death rolled, I should load back right after my trip. I'll do 1,000 things and bleed out from a jaguar and lose the 6 hours of progress I put into the game. I'm 20 hours in and I've already lost about half my progress. Now I'm all the fuck way back at the first camp and starting to not care anymore.

------------------------------------

Edit 1: Been playing for a while now. Holy shit, I hope you like chopping trees. After you've beaten the story mode, chilled in the DLC, played in the mud, there's not much else left to do. The gameplay loop ends a bit early, and once you've built a giant mud mansion, it gets boring. There's only so many leeches I can pull off and trees I can chop before the game just... becomes boring and repetitive.",1612278255,1678385088,True,3,0,0.541666686534881592,0,True,False,False

- Beautiful
- Take your time or speed run; either is fun
- Once you get the hang of crafting it's not cumbersome at all - pretty well designed
- Building mechanics are simple but work smoothly - everything goes together easy like lego
CONS:
- The weight system needs to be reviewed ASAP.  If I'm 1 pound overweight I shouldn't immediately start shuffling around at 1/10th the normal speed like I have Parkinsons for crying out loud.  Make it gradual and a large energy drain or something - don't giga-nerf the walk speed.  Frustrating.

#1:  Good competition for the ""Forest games"" 

#2: Decent story line and single/multiplayer Co-op player game. IF you don't cheat or use walkthoughs or even if you do ""a little"" (Like the map uploaded on the wiki or looking for a recipe for heated foods.. ) Still quite an involving story line if you are in specific ""generation age group"" (not that you have to be at all) You will enjoy the in engrossing story of single player, As well as the challenge. 

#3: Amazing graphics that is honestly not too taxing on your computer / hardware. (Even at low or medium quality settings) This helps with the immersion factor of the game and story line. 

#4: Mirrors the challenge to the user play style. (A rare-ish feature in a modern game) If you want to slow down and get down and gritty with the environment (Building a habitat to live in, farming plants, storing supplies for your next venture into the amazon ((How far this time into the unknown)) OR (no offence meant and maybe censored) ""Balls-to-the-wall"" aggressive approach to the story and the environment... well there's a place for you here too. 

#5: Decent sound track.  Few but important music ambiance. (I also agree with less music as it does distract from the immersion of you being alone (Kind of) in the middle of the jungle in near current times (2000s+). (Year technically unknown but sometime after 2005)

#6: Realistic sounds of everything. Creatures, Rain or other atmospheric effects, Weapons, the player moving though different environments (Sand, Forest floor, tree tops, bushes, water locations (Rivers and larger locations ((Ponds, Lakes,))  NPC  spoken words of both ""Native speaking language (at least English(Story line dialog)) and non-native but """"native"""" speaking voice sounds, (Hostiles calls of alert / scouting parties discovering your ""Base"" in the middle of the night while your nearby not sleeping and hunting a coconut (Yeah, you gotta try to find coconuts all the time. They are very usefull and essential for survival. ) 

#7: Custom difficult available in menus before start of game. This is a big one for me. I normally go for hardest settings when getting into any new game as it helps me learn the mechanics faster.. However, I completely understanding starting on easy or medium. This game takes it a step farther and really allows you to customize your experience down to finite detail. 

#8: Plenty of things to do. Explore, Build, Survive (Hopefully). Then after you master the game a couple of times: You may find yourself still playing doing some things in game you may have skipped your last play though. (Yep it's got some replay factors) 

#9: Multiplayer. Just wow. Well done, I could go into some detail here but its mostly personal and I wont bore you. I'll just leave it at: I can play both the story (Lots of it thanks to the ""Spirit update"") and endless ""Lets see what we can really build and experiment with"" modes with my young to old family members. (Serious fun if your into this type of game) 

The ability to see your teammates wounds and hand them a bandage you have one but they don't... amazing! As well as... (Wow just name another game that lets you do this action.....) Pull the leaches off your teammates body. Sheer genius!

#10: The devs are still involved even though its launched! Free and important DLC type materials for free! Patches! Forum and community involvement!  

#11: Real situations and tools that can teach you basic ideas on how to make tools in case you really end up stranded or alone in the wilderness. Game is possibly educational. 

Result: Worth the price especially if on sale if you enjoy this kind of game. 

Cons:

#1: There are still some building bugs. Oversize complex building normally results in failure. (Then again, SHOULD you be trying to build a extremely large or complex structure while in story mode when you are punching a clock so to speak (Of your own making) 

#2: Hostile enemies seem to be over powered when attacking your (Farms, Pens, Living structure, water purifier ect.. ) 

#3: Lack of real sleep due to your game level of involvement, (True to any game but worth mention as a disclaimer)

#4: Rattlesnakes. (They give this reviewer the hebie jebies) (You can turn them off in the custom gate settings mentioned above so this really doesn't count as a con... ) 

#5: Unclear map edges sometimes resulting in death without warning. Minor but annoying when you have a big open lake and you start to swim across it.. suddenly piranha death.  Sure you kinda know your going out of bounds but... they could mark that a bit more in the world or in the map so you can understand whats happening and why you are dying... so fast)

#6: Multiplayer death on any difficulty is bit harsh. Lose all your items (Half of which may randomly spawn at your death point and the selection of items also seems random) (Or so it seems) Loss of unique items (Steel Canteen) forever? Ouch since there is only one in the game it seems. 

Overall:
Great experience. Still playing it. Some annoying non game braking issues. 

Grab it!

Its a CLASSIC or will become one in the future that a few people on this planet will reference or lean from for ages to come. 
It may save your life someday if YOU become isolated or trapped in the wilderness. It also is just ... generally fun for fans of this type of game.

Quick summary of story mode: a very slow-moving survival game with heavy emphasis on survival. You will get extremely tired of obtaining multiple different lengths of sticks, but the story was engaging enough to carry me through to the end, and it's definitely satisfying to work your way up to being capable of handling anything the game throws at you, after a rough start where absolutely everything is lethally dangerous. I finished the story mode in a leisurely, unhurried 40-ish hours, burning time on building out two different campsites and wasting a good chunk of that time wandering around, either lost or trying to figure out where the hell I was supposed to go next.

Longer thoughts: 

When I saw this game up for sale during Midweek Madness with a very positive review score I had to pick it up out of curiosity, because I remember when it first hit steam. I remember watching someone play it, and it had been basically unplayable. A lot must have changed to swing the reviews so far in the other direction, right?

It does seem like a huge amount of work was done. It's a very pretty game. It sounds good too, which is really important, because sound is crucial to knowing what wildlife is around you -- you certainly won't always be able to see through the dense greenery. The game gives you a good array of tools to survive, but it also hides them behind an experimentation system of combining random elements on a crafting stone in search of correct recipes that will have you eventually checking a wiki, whether you're a die-hard 'I want to figure it out for myself' person or not -- I am that kind of person, but eventually the guessing game wears thin on technicalities (example: you cannot make a bow drill with a stick, rope, and plank -- you have to craft the bow as a bow and then use the bow in the recipe). On top of that, there are some tools or structures you have to unlock by finding them out in the jungle, and there are a bunch that you'll want to use but which won't make sense to bother with, because the game sort of requires you to stay more mobile than that.

The inventory interface is initially pretty unwieldy and takes some getting used to, but after a while it becomes second nature.

I enjoyed the story. It walked the very iffy line of 'being a game where you're a white dude in the jungle murdering locals' very carefully and did a pretty okay job of it, imo, which can't have been easy. I cared about the outcome and the characters, and the story went places I didn't expect. There were some weird plot issues (I had no idea the MC had amnesia until well into the game?), but nothing major.

There are still bugs, like overlapping text, and a few irritating things that aren't exactly bugs but are UX issues. If you pick something up while crouching, you can't uncrouch until you put it down. If you're crouched when you trigger a cutscene, you have to go through the cutscene crouched, moving at a glacial speed. There's an awkwardness to highlighting items on the ground quite often. You are able to carry 6 leaves, max, but the smaller trees you will constantly have to cut down to make beds and roofs have at least 7. Your carry weight is in general a bit absurd -- things weigh questionable amounts, meat in particular.

None of these minor issues were enough to keep me from completing the story mode, though, and I don't think they'll get in the way of my interest in playing the survival mode and the DLC stuff. Actually, if I have any gripes with the game at all, they are two in number, and they are these:

1) Jake Higgins is a VERY unpleasant character to spend time with, especially early on, because every time his tool breaks, and every time he has to light a fire, he throws a FURIOUSLY ANGRY MANBABY TANTRUM about it. The amount of rage involved is so over the top that it was pretty hard to like him, tbh. Like sure, survival situations are stressful, but this man is sitting on the ground in the jungle yelling 'son of a BITCH!!!!!' at sticks at the top of his lungs. This gets less awful as time goes on because he begins to suck less at crafting things so his tools break way less often, but he carries on road-raging about fire lighting through the whole game if he's even the slightest bit tired.

2) The game has a robust construction element, with all sorts of buildings that help you to obtain or store resources efficiently, but the structure of the story mode is such that you'll have to abandon them pretty quickly. Eventually you realize it doesn't make very much sense to construct more than the bare minimum to replenish your supplies before you move on, and you'll find yourself spending a tedious amount of time building a simple square frame, leaf roof, small fire, and leaf bed in many different places as little waystations for you to save your game and sleep. It's really just the collection of the materials for it, and how many times you have to go through doing it, that makes it tedious.

At any rate, I'm looking forward to trying the DLC and then starting a survival game where I can actually make the most of the construction.",1678134289,1678134289,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Devs have put significant effort into making this a great jungle survival game. The little touches\the graphics are all top notch, if it wasn't for the epic bowl movement sound effects while jumping it would be a 5/5. i'll have to give it a 4.9/5.

I recommend this game, yes, but not for everyone. 
The big advantage is (and I really think it's an advantage), if you don't like your early experience, ask a refund because it will not evolve much.

Don't think it's ""The Forest"" but in the jungle, some mechanics are similar but the global experience is different (I don't even understand how some players compare this game to Subnautica it's like comparing Cyberpunk and Need for Speed, yes, you drive cars in both of them but that's it).

Is the gameplay good ? 
It is very well designed BUT it's basically you wandering in the jungle watching the ground, depending of the difficulty you choose 90% of the time you'll be walking; running is'nt realy an option or you'll end bit/hurt/scratched/dead/fainted.

There is 2 type of players, the one who will play the game as intended, having to test like a prehistoric man each ressources you'll find and most of the time ending being poisonned/wounded/dead; the other type of player will use the Wiki.
Using the wiki will save you A LOT of time but will cut the difficulty and by extantion the gameplay easily by a half (we can say it cut half the fun).

The craft system and the inventory are a pain in the ass (Jesus we're in 2023, having to manually sort your back pack is really necessary ?) BUT it's very complete; the last building update added a nice touch.

Is the story good ?
No, like most of the simulator, the story is just an excuse to make you travel.
Part of it is a patchwork coming through the early access and being adapted to the final form of the game at the release, it's why sometimes the tone of some vocal lines don't really fit between them or in the situation you are, it was readapted.

Is it difficult ? 
Not really, the whole gameplay is designed around frustration and self control (a little bit like a Dark Souls). 
If you fight your gamer instinct, stay focused on the ground, walking instead of running and beeing disciplined (checking your body, washing yourself etc) it's kinda  easy even in highter difficulties. 
At the very second you'll try to play a little bit faster, not beeing focused, try to shorcuts, ignore the basics mechanics or try a 70/30 chance the game will punish you most of the time.

Notes :
The developpers worked hard on the game since the early access and even uptdate some contents after the official release. For me it's a big plus.",1677934490,1677935003,True,32,1,0.719630062580108643,0,True,False,False

All in all it is 10/10 for me :)
I finished the Original Game and also the DLC Amazonia

What can be improve?
- Enemy Champions
I found and killed one massive guy with TWO! Tribal Axes and that fight was amazing. Sadly he was the only one tall guy with a Mask. Would be cool to add more of those, making some fights difficult :)

- The Aztec Sword
It looks like it doesn't blend with the player like the other weapons. Also make it a bit bigger.

- Hand Movement
Maybe make the hands go up and down a bit, while moving and running. It should give the character a more realistic feel? 

- The Cats
The Big Cats are not that aggressive, they walk so slow that one arrow can one tap them. They should hide in tall/big plants or when they spotted you, they would run towards and attack. 

- Upgradeable Backpack? 
Maybe being able to create small pouches for certain things, even a Quiver for Arrows would be a nice addition to it :3

The crafting system is simple but made to seem overly complex by making everything a pain in the back side to do.
The graphics are very nice.

The story line is utter garbage. It basically boils down to this - mc writes a book, mc's girl is dying and runs up medical bills, mc goes with girl to jungle to find imaginary cure, cure some how turns into super virus . . .which apparently can be fixed with a venomous frog. . .oh, but you're too busy doing drugs to remember anything, or even do whatever you actually came to do. . .ending = you suck try again but you're still going to fail, but you're still going to suck as a human being. . .yeah, it's utter trash. 

Honestly it's very underwhelming and the only thing worth the price tag was the half arsed building and crafting, which could have been done better. . .same with inventory management, it's utter garbage. 

Devs need to learn that just because you make something look nice graphically it doesn't make it a good or user friendly system.  Just trying to set up a camp is a night mare of fighting with placement. . .

To be honest I'd place this game story wise on the same level as  blade and soul, meaning that it makes you want to off yourself it's so depressingly bad. The devs should be absolutely ashamed they put together such trash for a game and it's story line.


Honestly, the base building is cumbersome and seems like an asset flip to me. There are placement issues to the extreme, as you have to apparently cut down each individual blade of grass instead of the building clearing under brush when built. You can't put down a foundation for a floor other than five or more feet off the ground. Nearly all placement anywhere is yellow or red, so it won't place. Rocks are always in the way, you know, the ones which you could pick ax in real life but in the game you can only hopelessly stare at and think, 'well they put that in this nice flat area just to f you over for building'. There are no real roofing pieces. The bridge bits will only connect to existing buildings. . .and only in a half arsed manner. 

Honestly, I have no idea what people are praising about with this game when others like conan exiles, sons of the forest (which isn't even finished), 7dtd (which is a decade still in alpha), and so on did 100 times better.  The best part is that some how the devs think if you get a deep laceration that wrapping a leaf around it will prevent infection and heal it like a sterile bandage. It's quite apparent they know nothing about medicine, injuries, infections, herbalism, or even survival. The game was obviously just made to punish the player and nothing else. . . this is done by constantly injuring, infecting, etc. and making any sort of healing resources scarce. . .it's not a challenge, it's annoying.",1677845081,1677878941,False,4,0,0.477303415536880493,0,True,False,False

the story is good as well! you think you know what's going on but you really, actually don't. you're kinda learning along with jake. 

building is a bit annoying because things need to be put down in a specific order but, again, once you get the hang of it, it's easy. 

also, there are capybaras.

Pros:
- The game keeps you constantly moving and having to survive.
- The graphics are nice and clean. Are there a few things that could be fixed? Yes but that is with all games.
- The sound is decent and not over whelming or under played.
- At the time of this review I have not made it through the story line yet but so far it looks interesting.
- The controls are nice and smooth, but some of the aiming and getting stuck on things can be a pain.

Cons:
- The character you control dies way to easy. 
- The weight limit could be adjusted, and maybe it will be later in the game.
- On the medium level, there are attacks constantly from jaguars and from the tribesmen. Now maybe later on it gets better, but at the start I have fought the tribesmen multiple times and have yet to win a fight. I stabbed one of the tribesmen 4 or 5 times, did he die? Nope. The guy cuts me once and I bleed out right as his buddies jump in and defeat me. On another battle there was two of them. Once again I stabbed the guy with a spear 4 or 5 times and he just keeps coming. Then his companion jumps on me, hits me one time and I lose most of my life. I get it, they are supposed to be a tough group, but it shouldn't be so lopsided. I am pretty sure there is armor but I haven't figured it out yet. Was trying to avoid using the net yet.
- Some creatures show up way to much or they are to aggressive. My buddy and I were playing survival mode and it was like something out of a bad horror flick, the centipedes were attacking so often that we couldn't do anything without having to deal with them. I get that the devs were aiming to make it dangerous but some of the stuff is over done.

Overall at this point I would recommend the game. Some of my frustrations are due to the fact that I haven't learned everything yet and some are just small details like the combat but something tells me that it will get easier after I learn a bit more. After I get through the game and learn some more I will come back and will give an update to this review. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Items falling through the floor when placing them on the ground. Multiplayer doesn't update stats for non host. Many items from inventory gone in multiplayer when reloading game. It is very tedious adding wood to a burning fire or sticks to the furnace. Inventory management in your backpack is extremely annoying. You can't see the very bottom of the backpack so items can get lost there like fish bones and ants. At the very first tribal camp there is a bowl under the ground that you can add water into.

I really like how sound-based this game is and headphones make it even more immersive. I still get freaked out by rustling after 60 hours - is it a dangerous creature or just a dang armadillo!? 

After a little customization I could finally move the story along (still plenty difficult to maintain health even on a low health decay rate if you don't plan ahead and be careful). The story is good. At times I felt an inkling of figuring out what was happening before it did, but it was overall interesting and left me thinking about what I would do in this situation. The main story took me about 30 hours. I'm onto the prequel now which feels more challenging and dangerous with the hostile tribes being more prevalent (there are still notes on what to do but it's not as clear). I found a familiar place from the main story and felt a gut punch of devastation knowing what happens in the future.

There is farming, which is good to try establishing quickly for extra food if you stay in mainly one spot and it's not too challenging to keep up with. I also caught a tapir and a peccary - maintaining one animal was okay, having two seems a little more involved with keeping them fed and watered, and I'm not sure I would get more than two at this point because I still have plenty to do in the story. It is nice to feel some extra companionship though. 

I have only built in the story modes so far. Building is tedious but ends up looking cool. There are only a handful of empty patches on the map that encourage building and expanding out gets iffy - I've had to destroy some frames after finding that roofs wouldn't snap and that sucks because you lose some resources when you destroy items. It would be AMAZING if there was a customization to increase the amount of resources you harvest so you could build faster.

As it would be in real life, sustaining even a minor injury in Green Hell's jungle is a life threatening experience. The game forces you to learn how to deal with infections, rest and healing very nicely, and working toward getting a little camp going and building a sense of safety for yourself is very satisfying.

Green Hell eschews the standard hand-holding of modern games in favour of emphasis on player knowledge itself, which I love. You don't get to hover your mouse over a plant to see what it is and what it can do; it has no name and if you want to see if it's helpful or harmful, you will need to experiment. Then, you can name it yourself. This philosophy underlies a lot of the game's mechanics which can, admittedly, at times be a little too obscure for my taste (trying to work out what you can craft by randomly combining things) but in general is a breath of fresh air.

The game's main story is quite good and definitely worth playing through, even though it does unfortunately sit quite at odds with the actual gameplay since it really discourages you from building a permanent base. At the end of the day, you can learn what you need to survive and basically always be on the move, foraging as you go and setting up temporary shelters when necessary.

The Spirits of Amazonia mode, afterward, lets you satisfy your base building desires at last, and has a number of other goals that encourage exploration.

Unfortunately, there are some things that don't work perfectly. Pretty much every resource can be found pretty much everywhere -- they're not always easy to find right away, but they're around. This means that aside from SoA's small quest/grinding system which encourages you to explore, there's not much reason to go far from your base in terms of raw gameplay mechanics. There was nothing I ever really found myself ""needing"" other than one freak 3 hour period where the plants you make bandages from just... weren't spawning anywhere for me.

Furthermore, the crafting does leave a little to be desired. There's a variety of tiers of tools and weapons, but the tiers are ultimately quite meaningless and aside from personal satisfaction there's very little functional reason to strive for anything better. You can make the essential things pretty early in the game, and then you're pretty much set. Even advanced crafting like forging with metal doesn't feel like it gives you much benefit, which is a pity because the detail in the crafting process itself is quite cool.

The same goes for the skill system, which feels a little bit tacked on. Most skills aren't really impactful in a significant way, so I honestly tended to forget there were even skill levels.

This kind of thing eats at the core experience. I had a grand base building project in mind, and began by making a very rudimentary encampment with one roof for shelter over a fire and no walls. It was all really fun to get going but once I finally had the resources to begin building my real base, I quickly realised it wouldn't actually offer me much functional advantage; I already had everything I needed and there wasn't really any way to progress further, aside from simply enjoying the aesthetics of a nice base with more room for storage. The raids of enemies on my base never seemed to involve more than 2 or 3 enemies that were easy to deal with quite quickly, so that sense of danger that should have wanted me to hide behind walls started to fade away too.

I guess in the end it would have been nice to have some more difficult enemies requiring some more advanced preparation which would in turn require a more sophisticated base of operations. But that's just me -- I'm not big on building for the sake of building, preferring a very functional meta-game, and if you love the creative side of base building games you'll still have a blast!

I still highly recommend the game because it's a really cool experience! I'm looking forward to playing again once I've forgotten everything!",1677302756,1677302756,True,15,1,0.684122145175933838,0,True,False,False

First it seems like really well made survival simulation, and everything you do seems realistic. 
Inventory management you have to do somewhat manually, dragging and dropping, which I liked a lot. No pausing there either, so better be clear of those jaguars or what not. 
Crafting is fun and requires decent effort, and it is rewarding to see things getting easier with those tools you just crafted. 
Buildings require you to put needed materials in place, which I liked a lot, seemed like actually building.
It's dangerous out there! You'd better watch your step and listen your surroundings, it'll save your life, and that's always rewarding to see that your supreme survivalism just saved you!

BUT:
First issue we had with was somewhat related to rain. When it rains nonstop for days on end and your first thought (albeit it being a rainforest) is that its a bug, should tell you something about the game. It seems to be game mechanic, but all those little issues and oddities before made us think that it just broke. 
Then the crafting hit our faces: you get recipies AFTER you crafted something, and when you know you need this certain thing but lack the moonlogic... 
Next, after killed by that big cat, tooltip tells you to back away slowly and it will flee after few hits... well thats just BS. We NEVER encountered whatever feline without casualities. Also, first time we were able to kill it rather easily, last time it took MANY hits to kill, no any sign of wounded animal retreating. If you manage to kill the feline, most certainly it has scratched you bad, so you need to bandage up, and during you wound dressing, your loot just disappears in front of your eyes, so either skin the cat and bleed out, or survive getting nothing. Also, what are spears used for if anything you fight can get to hit you?

Then, when the wilderness seems to level up with your struggling efforts, is the final blow to survivalism for me: metal armor. What you do when you are in a jungle for few days? Well, basic survival 101, build a forge and make your self a metal armor. Really? Then, that pesky rattlesnake bites you despite you being clad to metal, and as nobody told you how to make antivenom, you try to frantically find some shroom or flower before dying in poisoning within 30 seconds AND losing that metal armor you spent hours crafting as the game mechanic dictates. And it was I who stood next to my dying friend and looked as most of the inventory just vanished in front of my eyes being upset. There's a ragequit for you. 

UPDATE
Finished the game now (sort of). Issues got bigger until the end, connection issues probably aren't the games fault, but syncing got really weird at times. When my friend lost connection and I kept playing, when she got back, all of the food in her backpack was spoiled (it really didn't take even 1 ingame day). Also stats were totally random, and places where she spawned back, at times in places where we hadn't explored yet. Also gear disappeared at times. 
Crafting and building wise there aren't much to discover after the very first beach. Metal armor carried me to the very ending so that most threats weren't but mere annoyances. Also, the bigger the base you want to build, the more problems it spawns, at times not accepting required items so that you need to find very peculiar angle to be able to install current bit. It's a shame, as building our settlement was the most enjoyable thing to both of us in this game. It is also a shame, that we spent many hours building, and at the end game you cannot return to them. 
Endgame also feels rather unfinished, being rather empty and without dangers and lore bits missing half of sentences. 
Final cherry on top of everything, game crashed on me at the end credits, so I didn't got the achievement my friend got...

I hope they will hone these things, as I can see the potential diamond.

Beware of the surprise cheetah that will spawn behind a random tree and just come eat you. I understand the cheetah jumping me near the boars and capy locations but the random spawn in the middle of nowhere that happens more than it does near animals is absurd.

As for MULTIPLAYER, the survival system is a joke online. Food is already difficult to manage early game on singleplayer. The game just about forces you to die to reset your meters. Otherwise you'll be zombies fighting imaginary enemies until much later.

Once to a Jaguar, 
Once to an infection, 
Once to insects, and 
Once to my sanity falling so low I freaked out and fell off a cliff (stupid worms - I've never genuinely yelled ""Not the worms again! Stop passing out on the ground when the bed is RIGHT THERE!""). 

I love the foraging and pure survival aspect and I oddly feel like I'm learning? You can't get too comfortable in this game. If you're not paying attention you could walk into a fire ant hill or miss a rattlesnake on the ground. Also, how is finding a new plant so scary, like are you going to kill me or will you help me, only one way to find out. 

Actual series of events:
-I'm about to die to dehydration, I have to drink the river water.
-Great a parasite.
-Oh great now there's three parasites.
-My god, I need to do something about these parasites because my guy is stupid weak right now and complaining like a baby.
-There is some mushrooms here.
-Oh god please don't kill me mushroom gods.
-OH! These kill parasites? What are the chances! (eats a ton to kill the small country of parasites I've acquired)
-Now to continue playing, I'll be more careful now that I know how to play.
-What's that sound? Please be one of those pig things.

This game explores clans and jungles, with many components of constructing and upgrading huts, hunting for food and avoiding poisonous plants and animals, and searching for and creating sources of freshwater.

I believe this game surpasses many other survival games in terms of realism and accuracy to what would be found in a real-life survival situation.

I haven't played much of the story yet, but from what I gather from the tutorial, the voice acting is very well done and the story about exploring the local tribes and their structures takes a nice creative direction amidst the survival aspect of the game.

The game has a multiplayer mode which is very enjoyable and can make survival more engaging and easier if you don't want to go through it alone.

I highly recommend this game, as I have experienced very few bugs and have enjoyed the time I have spent playing it.

I know this sounds confusing but the game is trying too hard to be 2 games at the same time.

Part 1:
It has hardcore survival aspects which are neat. Such as needing to check your specific limbs to see what is wrong to apply the appropriate remedy. You learn everything from trial and error. Such as, you do not know if things are edible unless you try it, what things work for rashes, etc. You have to up keep, proteins, thirst, fats, and carbs. Certain foods apply to certain areas. All of this would be fine if that was the main focus of the game was to survive while running through the story but you kind of have to do the second part as well in order to survive.

Part 2:
The game attempts to be a crafting game but it feels shoehorned in due to how overbearing the survival parts are. Shoehorned might be the wrong word here since the crafting behaves well but can become incredibly repetitive compared to other games in this genre. I thoroughly enjoyed and liked how the devs made the crafting parts a little more realistic in the sense of how one would build a structure in the middle of the Amazon. Many of the crafting things have to be ""attempted"" to learn them. There are no quests that may teach you new techniques. You can literally go through the whole game without ever knowing or learning how to make armor or other items.

Most games in this genre kind of encourage the player to make a base with all of the things they need. Adventure out for the next quest or unique materials, and then return with the bounty. Green hell is opposite in that you are often better off scavenging what you need while you move along to the next objective. Essentially the two mechanics end up fighting each other in the end.",1676328359,1676328359,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can, from experience, complete the story in about 12 hours maybe a little more depending on how much you explore and read every note. (you don't need to build a base to complete the story)

Outside of the story and into base building and multiplayer. It's a small map to be honest. It fits the story just fine, but for several people running around, it gets small quick.

Running into 3 rattlesnakes in a span of 50 feet and then getting attacked by a Cougar doesn't make for compelling gameplay. All happened within an almost fresh spawn too. Tarantulas are also not deadly by any means, but this game sure does like to make them seem like it. The type of scorpions they have modeled in the game are also the kind with less potent venom and also not deadly. In any case, I'm sure the Amazon is quite deadly in general, but that doesn't mean it makes for good gameplay having literal landmines everywhere at any given point. There are audio queues for the danger, but you're usually already bit before you hear them. 

Everything in this game just feels cumbersome and time consuming with no payoff. The story mode is about the only thing that feels rewarding, but survival is just bland and boring. I'd rather the Tribesmen be the main threat where animals are just a minor inconvenience rather than the main headache (aside from the cougars). Sorry to be the unpopular opinion here, but The Forest does way more for the Survival genre than this game. 

Probably the most offensive thing about this game is that VR is a separate build altogether with a separate price tag. I played The Forest exclusively in VR, while my friends played in Desktop mode in co op. The fact I can't do that with this game certainly means my friends won't be buying this.

I love this game. The survival aspect is so uncompromising, you have to be wary of stingrays, jaguars, Black caiman, parasites, poisonous spiders, hostile natives and not to mention starvation and dehydration. The beginning is brutal as you try to figure things out and spend multiple lives trying to make sense of the system. You use your environment to make weapons, homes, and armor like armadillo skins to protect your arms and legs. Even when you think you are all ready and kitted out all it takes is one screw up (like stepping on a rattlesnake) to throw your stride off.

- Skipped the supernatural monsters, but is still one of the most nerve-racking survival experience since litterally everything can kill you (ants, frogs, etc...).

Cons :
- The sandbox aspect isn't as relevant as in other games since the story incites you to move around and adopt more of a nomad style with minimal outposts rather than building a serious base with defenses and everything... which is ironic since the last update on building will only be relevant to those who wish to play in creative mode.

in all seriousness this is a pretty fun game. I played it entirely co-op and will base this review on that playthrough. Partner and always look for games to play together, and Green hell took some persuading, but in the end he got convinced.
This game will have you cursing a lot, get frustrated, you will die lots of stupid deaths especially at the beginning but when you learn its best to not attach yourself to any of your possessions, it all gets infinitely more fun (although im still salty about the loss of my bidon, F in chat for my bidon)
The plot is a bit all over the place, but the survival is well balanced in a brutal way, there are things more realistic than you expect (yes, you picking up a thing in your hands will add to your carryweight!) and you start to constantly weight certain risks against their rewards. The world is super fun to explore with distinct biomes, and somehow youll never find animals when youre looking, but when youre just trying to make it back to your nice leaf bed, they will find you, they will bite you and you will be putting maggots on your infected wound because you couldnt clean yourself because you passed out on your way to water from said animal attack.

I'm going to give you a list of things you should know [u]exclusively if you are planning to play co-op[/u] while avoiding spoilers. [b]TL/DR at bottom[/b]
[hr][/hr]
[b] Save System [/b]
The biggest issue we noticed was saving the game. There is next to [u]no autosave[/u] but you get opportunities to save at most structures you make, and using calendars at some world structures. Here's how it works and some things to note:

When the host of the session saves, their playerstate (health,hunger etc) and inventory, the world, and the story progression saves to the hosts computer, as it would in singleplayer. 

When clients save, their playerstate and inventory saves ALSO [u]to the host's computer. [/u]

Because all saving is done to the host's computer, to avoid any sort of save corrupting it's good to:
- Have the player with the most stable internet connection be the host, loss of host's connection will result in disconnecting clients and therefore their inventories will likely be reverted to when they last manually saved. (Having a high latency didn't seem to be an issue)
- Avoid players saving at the same time and allow each save attempt to complete before the next player attempts. (In the bottom right of the screen, there is a save icon that will disappear when it is safe for someone to save.)
- Avoid playing green hell when steam planned maintenance will occur during your play session. This occurs every week on Tuesday 11pm GMT. If the maintenance begins during your play session of most steam games, varying results may occur. In the case of Green Hell, the host will play fine. The clients, however, will receive an error message every time any type of save is attempted. This means that none of the client's save attempts will register during the entirety of the session, and the session should be closed to resume playing after steam services have returned.
[hr][/hr]
[b] Other [/b]
If a client's save is behind in the story for whatever reason, the client should be able to access any area the host can even if the tools required are not visible in the inventory.

I recommend that every player saves before attempting the finale. The game will warn you when it is about to occur and give you the option to postpone the finale. There is currently (and has been for years) a bug in which if clients disconnect immediately after beginning the finale, the clients will not be able to experience the finale (and receive the ending achievement) until the host has re-launched the session and attempted the finale with everyone present again. I recommend saving immediately before attempting the finale in the case that this bug occurs, which will allow all players to try again without losing progress.
[hr][/hr]
This is based off my experience with playing through the main story of Green Hell with one other player. Your experience may differ. Don't let these small caveats deter you from experiencing the game, we found it to be a positive experience regardless of losing some progress to these issues.

TL/DR: save often, but each player saves one at a time and don't play during steam maintenance.",1675226320,1675234848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EDIT:

Upon further review I have to say on the whole, this is a good game and I would recommend it. 

However, the player condition system needs to be revamped. There are certain scenarios where getting injured or poisoned is essentially a death sentence with no way out of it. Great example is the jaguar/worm mechanism. If you get torn up by a jaguar, you need at minimum 2 anti-infection bandages (usually 4, I've never been attacked by a jaguar and had less than 3 lacerations as a result). If you use regular bandages, you're almost 100% guaranteed to get infected. If you get infected and develop a fever, you have a very small amount of time to gather the additional resources needed to craft more bandages to heal your wounds and stop the fever.

If you don't get the resources needed, you'll pass out and wake up with worms and a very small amount of energy until you pass out again. Depending on your macros, your health may have already started draining at this point or will begin to soon. Now you have a very small window of time to continue to find the resources needed to craft bandages to start to heal and the additional resources now needed to remove the worms.

Can't find the resources you need in about 60 seconds? Guess you'll just have to pass out again and lose more macros and health. And god forbid you leave the worms in because your sanity will be gone in about an hour of game time. At that point, hallucinated warriors will attack you and somehow cause real damage (???).

At this point, having 60 seconds of play time between passing out, you're fighting off hallucinated warriors, trying to keep your macros up (possibly getting parasites in the process, a whole other system I didn't even mention), trying to find materials to craft bandages and trying to find materials to craft worm picks. 

It literally becomes impossible and the devs would be well served to consider revamping the condition system so the different systems don't stack and it becomes impossible to survive.

Pick/Harvest plants and eat them to find different effects.
Get familiar with potential spawns of dangerous, semi stationary creatures at the start to avoid venomous bites.
Test what you can harvest and craft in your inventory.
Die allot!

You can't avoid it! If you don't know what to look and listen for, then you'll probably not survive until you do. And even then you can get surprise mauled by a cat unless you manage to protect yourself.

Quite enjoyable game even when you've mastered most of it, because a small misstep can start a fight for survival if you're not prepared for it! So read the note book about plants and the effects you've discovered so you have things at hand for most emergencies.

[b] Surely, it's a gem, which needs polishing a bit. [/b] The game is great - you play as Jake Higgins, who is a doctor who tries to find a cure for his wife, while going adventures and exploring the jungle. That's all about story, because [b] story - in my opinion - isn't good or bad, it's in between these. [/b]
Okay, so what made me to give positive review to this game? I'll explain: [b] the game is kinda hard - but it's what it's when you're a man who is just thrown into the jungle, who tries to survive and to find his beloved wife. [/b] Game does it well. It has a steep learning curve, but when you understand the basics, the game is just pretty simple. You need to fill 3 macronutrients indicators, take care of your health and sanity. The game punishes or rewards you for every choice you make. Every plant/animal (as food) is unknown and gives other effects while eating. Some may lower your hunger, some may lower your sanity, and some will make you dead/vomit.
Okay, so I pointed (in short) eating and surviving above. [b] Let's go to survival aspects - combat, building, crafting. [/b]

[b] [u] Combat [/u] [/b]

So as I stated above - the game is hard (everything tries to kill you, even your wrong choices can make yourself as enemy).
But there are other dangers you need to fight: tribals (not hard, but they always attack in groups so it may be hard, when your only weapon is spear); big cats (jaguars and pumas); caymans and piranhas; snakes, spiders and scorpions. Combat is pretty simple - every headshot ends in a kill. And if you hit (by hitting/throwing) any other part of the body - enemy will bleed out soon. [b] So combat is pretty simple, you only need to maintain your stamina, block and hit. [/b]

[b] [u] Crafting [/u] [/b]

[b] Crafting is pretty simple - it's intuitive [/b] - you want a spear? [spoiler] Okay, so you need to put 1 stone blade, 1 long stick and 1 rope. [/spoiler] That's all, every item you make is saved in your notebook. All you need is to find new blueprints (found when exploring the jungle and finding new items/constructions) and you need to collect new materials (for example, to unlock bamboo things, besides those made of wood).

[b] [u] Building [/u] [/b]

[b] Building might be a chore, depends on how big things you build. [/b] Almost every construction needs long sticks or logs (so you need to cut down many trees to make a big building for example). [b] The way you build is great, [/b] you just put your plans, and fullfill them - step by step - with the items needed. The only bad things (besides the one said above) are that constructions don't stop rain animation inside the building and animals just ""penetrate"" them. And to add to the end, you need a lot of flat surface to build - the game is just lacking flat surfaces; you need to clear the surface from almost all plants and trees before you can build on it. [strike] I need to add that they forgot to add the option to just chop down the fallen logs (I mean the short ones, not ""footbridges""). [/strike]

[b] [u] Performance and graphics [/u] [/b]

[b] The game is made by small a studio, using Unity Engine, so optimization isn't good, but it's not that bad. But the graphics are stunning - seriously, everything looks just beautiful. [/b]

[h1] Overall rating: 7/10 [/h1]
As stated before, [b] the game is great, but isn't perfect, [/b] the optimization could be better and there should be more mechanics and items (but [b] the studio is still working on adding new content so it looks promising [/b]).
[b] Pros: [/b]
- graphics,
- mechanics,
- great survival,
- crafting system.
[b] Meh: [/b]
- story,
- survival mode (I didn't know where to put it, but [b] survival is just great, BUT [/b] if you played story first, then you'll wander around the same map, searching for the same items and blueprints (just in other places) and after achieving all your goals (for example building a big base), the game just feels kinda boring.
[b] Cons: [/b]
- optimization,
- building,
- slow development,
- it's grindy a bit and monotonous.

I found the majority of this game to be hugely annoying but I suffered through it with a group of 3 others. I started on hard difficulty and then we switched to normal because managing your ""macros"" along with the various health issues is beyond frustrating.
First off I had the impression this game was similar to The Forest where there's enough content that its worth building a base and exploring from there, but there's honestly not. There's no cave systems or anything interesting to the map and while the map is ""open world"" its really VERY linear in how you progress the story (literally just follow the paths through the jungle.) 
Base building is a waste of time and incredibly annoying as there's no real way to efficiently transport the resources needed to build anything beyond a simple hut. And Tribesmen destroy most structures in a few hits, wasting any of the time you spent gathering and building. There's no real need because you can just progress the story, which refills all your different health bars at certain points. If you do only the story stuff there's probably like 5 hours worth of game play tops. Combat in this game is completely meh, playing on normal AND hard we barely ran into any Tribes or predators. 
The way you interact with the world from things like fireplaces for cooking to building and crafting, to checking yourself for cuts or leeches is just straight up annoying. 
I also found the characters in the story to be incredibly grating, especially when you start losing sanity and your consciousness starts yelling at you with no breaks until you get your sanity back up. The story is just bad and any of the twists were so obvious.
This game sucks. Again, I'm shocked the reviews were so high. It's way too similar to The Forest and it's worse in literally every single conceivable way. I wouldn't even consider the ""macro"" mechanics or various health ailments to add any level of difficulty or interesting mechanics because it becomes easy once you learn where different food items are, and all the differently ailments are 100% avoidable once you learn what causes them (except leeches or cuts.) All this stuff just serves to make the game incredibly annoying.

Remember, the more time you spend in the jungle the less of a prey you become.

It was so janky in controls, i couldn't put the materials in my hand into the building i had placed without a lot of maneuvering around until i was pointing at the correct pixel from the correct angle for it to allow me to place the material or highlight an item on the ground to finally pick it up even though im pointing 100% directly at the object, it wont notice, and sometimes it will highlight an item to be picked up when im not looking even close to the item that's almost off my screen i can finally pick it up.

Maybe there's a button to click and drag (like Skyrim) an item but it didn't tell me so i put my coconut shells in the water and i couldn't pick them back up. Took me a couple ""picking items up"" (by hitting E) tries before i realized that the shells are ""filled"" with water (which makes sense since they are submerged in the water) and i was ""drinking"" it, not picking it up, so, how would I move it to the fire? idk
The jankyness and the lack of simple information of just functioning in the game made for a very frustrating experience. I'm sure this is a great game but there's no way I can recommend this. I played the hell out of The Forest and Grounded as well, both are this style of survival game but even though The Forest is buggy at times (cuz it was the first of this style), at least it has a decent flow in the player's experience and controls. I would forgive this a bit if it was Early Access and devs were actively getting it out of EA.

2 Hours before refund just isn't long enough to get past the janky bs when I'm almost about to hit that 2 hour mark and I barely got to experience the game.

I feel like this game could have a *lot* more building aspects. They just now added a door, you know? There's not a lot going on, for a survival building game. And you're discouraged from building where ever, instead having these little clearings all over the map where you are encouraged to build. 
Tribes people will come and wreck your stuff at random, where in you'll have to rebuild, so that's kinda nice. They also attack you at random or jungle cats will. So it's not a boring game, there are challenges and thought behind it. The map isn't massive, but it's pretty darn big. It is absolutely beautiful though, lots of plants and trees and brush, tons of things to keep an eye out for, like critters in and out of the water. Running through the jungle haphazardly isn't a good idea, you can trip over any manner of things, like rattlesnakes. 

Story is pretty good. The voice acting is on point, and the pacing for said story is very spread out but not so much you're ripping your hair out. It obviously has an underlying message for the masses, but all in all, it's a very good game. If they add more things to build of substance, I would say this is a game I would buy off sale.

 CreepyJarDev_Alicia  [developer] Posted: Jan 25 @ 4:55am
You can adjust the difficulty level as you create a new game through Custom options. Disable AIs, aggressive animals, leeches etc. And you can boil water by filling up a bowl (tortoise shell for example) and putting it on a campfire.

My point is if you need to disable AI's, animals, and what not just to get though your game means you need to tone down your difficulty of the game its self. Second no matter how much i tried to pick a bowl with liquid in it from a water source it would make a splash noise as if i lost all the water oh and my favorite bull I found out if you got the canteen it would only put out my fires instead of let me boil water in it.

I just want to finish this review with this said I play lots of survival based games and I enjoy a lot of them and that's why I play them for the enjoyment not for frustration not for bad mechanics I play them because it reminds me of my uncle who was a Guide / survivalist trainer. teaching me how to survive in situations like these as a child. It just sickens me when some game devs think in a real life senior you would face all these dangers at once should really get out there and try experiencing it for a week after some training they would realize 90% of the time you would not face hafe the dangers they throw at you or issues or with barely any training.

Bought the game 2 years ago... did something I NEVER do, and waited to give it a review, to give them time to build the game up more...

Came back yesterday... played all day yesterday, and all day today (couldn't have been more excited for the build update)... and both days had the same thing in common... I was forcing myself to play... to justify having (once again) wasted money on a EA title, simply because my thirst for the genre (which remains unquenched)

The game is extremely slow, the progression feels horrible, the game itself feels empty (in terms of things to do)... I spend 20 minutes working to make/craft/build X item, and when I'm done crafting it feel almost 0 satisfaction... and it's like ugh, well that was a letdown now what... do it again, same result (for 2 RL days worth of gaming)... 

The game is very beautiful... but somehow at the same time feels extremely outdated visually... It feels just so... clunky... trees, mountains, terrain... while very simple, LOOK GREAT... the player, it's movement, it's resource management (watch, build, ""Inspect"") all look horrible, and feel SO weighted, like they're just weighing you down with ugly boringness.... 
I said in my TLDR, and it's the only way I know how to describe it... the character FEELS like you're playing a stick figure... everything feels so... idk rigid? the moments, the visual of it all just... idk heavy? clunky?.... Picture in your head you're in a very realistic survival game... but your character is a gingerbread man... you know how they would walk, if you watched them in a cartoon or w/e? that's what playing this character (game) feels like to me (which is clearly my biggest gripe, based purely on how long this description is XD)
Even the way the character moves... it's SO robotic... he holds his arm up to inspect a scratch like he's a robot, or calling for his drop pod to beam him up

I ALWAYS base my reviews (good or bad) with... If I could get my time & money back.... would I do it... I absolutely would, which means I cannot recommend this game",1674598072,1674598072,False,2,0,0.460514992475509644,0,True,False,False

You can live off of a 1x1 box with a roof and a campfire to boil water and make food. You'll spend most of your time out anyways so i was barely ""home"".

Players take on the role of a researcher who has crash-landed in the jungle and must survive against the elements, wildlife, and his own sanity. The game features realistic and detailed graphics, as well as an immersive sound design that creates a sense of isolation and danger. The gameplay is challenging and requires players to manage their hunger, thirst, and health while also gathering resources and building shelter.

One of the strengths of Green Hell is the game's attention to detail, with realistic and accurate depictions of the Amazon rainforest and the creatures that inhabit it. The game also features a unique ""mental health"" system where the player's mental state will affect their gameplay, such as hallucinations and paranoia. The game also features a story-driven campaign and various survival modes, such as a ""permadeath"" mode that adds to the game's replayability.

Another strength of the game is the crafting system, where players must gather resources and craft tools, weapons, and shelter to survive. The game also features a day and night cycle, and weather effects, which adds to the realism and immersion.

Overall, Green Hell is a challenging and immersive survival game that offers a unique and exciting experience for players. The game's attention to detail and realistic depiction of the Amazon rainforest make it stand out among other survival games. The game offers a unique gameplay experience, with the added feature of mental health system and a story-driven campaign.

It's a thrilling challenge to stay healthy while racing against the clock. At first it can be overwhelming, but with practice, you'll quickly become familiar with the plants and animals, and learn what to listen for and what to avoid. Once you have a base established, you have more time to focus on other goals. It's a great feeling to have a secure base, but you need to be prepared to defend or abandon it if necessary. It's a fascinating balancing act!

Creepy Jar have crafted a truly remarkable survival experience with Green Hell, which wonderfully captures the sense of loneliness and peril that comes from true isolation. Players are presented with a range of ways to enjoy the immersive jungle environment, and the game's well balanced challenges and user friendly approach make it accessible to everyone regardless of their familiarity with hunger and thirst mechanics. There's plenty of fun and excitement to be found in this forbidding jungle, and it's sure to provide an unforgettable experience.

The difficulty of Green Hell is touted as a selling point, but in some situations without logical application of  the games mechanics, it can sometimes feel more like a tedious chore than a creative sandbox survival game. Still: Would buy again!",1673804641,1673804641,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]If you have experienced ""The Forest"" and didn't like it, you'll probably hate this one too. In addition to it, be prepared for glitches and bad optimization. Phobic people must be aware: tons of spiders, snakes, insects, rodents, heights (not as much as Tomb Raider, e.g.), deep water, blood, vomit, etcetera. Which make this game, maybe, not suitable for everybody.[/b]

[b](+)[/b] I'll never be in a forest, NEVER, specially Amazon. But I think this game quite catch the feeling of being alone in a truly green hell;
[b](+)[/b] Devs must have had help from some expert survivalist people, and they did quite well, either on graphics or on animations (eating, healing, etc.);
[b](+)[/b] I kinda like this blueprints construction type (ghosts semi-transparent models of buildings), but its constraints sucks.

[b](-)[/b] Far beyond bugs (or glitches, not insects and such), Green Hell is badly optimized. It's even worse playing Spirits of Amazonia, don't know why. Near tribal camps I got 15~25 fps. Reducing quality and tweaking nvidia settings was the way to get 30~40 fps. A bad joke, don't you think?
[b](-)[/b] Jake Higgins: For an Anthropologist Doctor, who has been studying in the Amazon for 3 years, he's pretty dumb. He can't identify the majority of plants and mushrooms, for example. He's unable to craft something unless he finds an item first;
[b](-)[/b] AI and combat system are poor, so to speak;
[b](-)[/b] There's a pencil on the left side of every map, but why cant Jake write something on the map? A marker? Any stupid person can write down on a paper, even with charcoal. The whole navigation system is a mess. You dropped the ball here, devs;
[b](-)[/b] I don't like The Forest and its stupid inventory system. You just copy/paste it here. Not having a rapid access to items like food or healing, let's call it ""clunky mechanics"": could add to ""like the real world"" thing, but not to our fun as players/gamers;
[b](-)[/b] You can die (and will die) horribly and fast for virtually any reason. It's laughable, and you can hear them (devs) laughing at you on every death by poison, fever on infection that they never teach you how to properly treat/clean wounds. Jake is also an imbecile, so yeah! Until you get used to it and know things (I mean search for community guides).


You will definitely get a (virtual) survival experience. A very hard one with Green Hell. There's no guidance, there's no markers, no lights, no interactive map, just your endless battery smart watch (thanks to Mia) and all the knowledge you can get from third-party guides.

The story is not bad at all if you make it through the first 2-3 in-game days. You have to learn how to create a stone spear, axe or other tools/weapons, while you have to learn blueprints to construct a log bed or any other base constructions. There’s not much to explore. The search for unknown orange fatty nuts made me progress in the game. 

You have to drink, eat meat, eat fats, and eat carbs, while you get tired and actions require a certain amount of stamina, which is also reduced by exhaustion. You can’t ignite a small bonfire or hunt if you’re too low on stamina. Then, you have to find mushrooms to avoid death or eat anything with «energy». You can’t just sleep anywhere without concequences, but you’ll likely fade and get parasites under your skin, which leads to infection. Even an untreated wound would likely lead to a deadly infection. Therefore, you need to prepare dressings and sleep off the ground or near a fire. One preparation is the ash dressing, another is a dressing that treats poison bites. Poisoning will make you thirsty and make you loose energy rapidly. You’ll get fever. You need to prepare something over a bonfire, but you won’t make it if you haven’t already lit a fire and there is water nearby. And you’re likely to meet both somewhat aggressive tribes if you stay near them and stalking predators (throw stones or learn to use the bow gradually). With three ash dressings you can survive a Leopard attack, but the problem is getting the Molineria leaves in the first place and the ash isn’t readily available before the bonfire burns out. If not, it’s perhaps better to get covered by rashes creates by ants or bees and slowly turn insane instead, perhaps combined with leaches? After a few days more things will spawn like the coconuts. But you won’t necessarily find ecactly what you need, so look for orange, red or blue mushrooms. 

The main game isn’t a big challenge compared to the extra content. There’s a lot to do in the three parts of Spirits of Amazonia. The first part is a grind, the next one is getting better, and the third is actually the background for the main story. But very few will make that far. It’s a hard extra game. You won’t make it if you get bitten by snakes, spiders, scorpions, and stingrays. So you have to construct bases where you can sleep, so you can retreat quickly. Or else, you can’t make it. You won’t go very far before you’re bitten. It’s unavoidable to prevent poisonous bites because you lose your concentration after 30 mins. So how do you go through the game?

You won’t. And that’s exactly what the insanity is about.",1672789867,1672844943,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Between the stunning scenery and level of detail that has gone into the functionality of this game is incredibly fun. I can see myself getting lost in this with extreme highs and lows as things progress and life in the jungle seems to take over. With so many things to explore and plenty to keep you busy just the everyday struggle to live is enough to keep you going for hours. The sense of a strong learning curve is there, but that's a huge part of survival. You have to learn and adapt to your surroundings and try new things. I really like the fact they incorporate a realistic incentive whether or not to actually go balls out and try something new or stay safe and stick with what you know is going to work/ keep you safe. 

Overall lots of fun! Great early access game. I hope the full game can keep up the momentum they have started. Well worth the $20 if you enjoy survival adventure.

PS:  It's still extremely ""bugy"" and can be funny or annoying at times.

In the game, players must gather resources, craft items, and build shelters in order to survive against the various dangers that roam the land. One of the things I enjoyed the most about Green Hell was playing with friends and watching each other die in hilarious ways.

One of the standout features of Green Hell is its immersive gameplay. The game is set in a beautiful, procedurally generated rainforest that players can explore and discover hidden secrets in. The crafting system is also robust, allowing players to create a wide variety of items and structures in order to survive against the dangers of the forest.

Playing Green Hell with friends added an extra layer of enjoyment to the game. We had a lot of fun watching each other die in silly ways, whether it was from falling off a cliff or getting attacked by a venomous snake. The game's multiplayer mode also allows players to help each other out by sharing resources and building structures together.

In terms of presentation, Green Hell is solid. The graphics are good, with detailed character models and environments. The sound design is also well-done, with realistic sound effects and atmospheric music.

Overall, Green Hell is a great survival game that offers an immersive gameplay experience. Its beautiful rainforest setting, robust crafting system, and enjoyable multiplayer mode make it a must-play for fans of the genre. The game's challenging gameplay and hidden secrets also add to the replay value.

The jungle is full of danger and you need to look and listen for spiders, anthills, beehives, snakes, hostile natives, jaguars, caimans and pumas. At the same time you need to forage for nuts, fruits, coconuts, and medicinal plants. On top of that you are constantly managing your carbs, proteins, fats and water nutrition meters and your energy, health and sanity meter.

I like that Green Hell is not grindy. Building a base can be done in 10 minutes if you're experienced, it is not necessary to spend hours collecting materials. The only thing that requires time is the mud brick buildings and iron tools. But they're not necessary to complete the game.

Green Hell really doesn't hold your hand. A lot of times you have no idea how to progress without looking online. You need to be observant and clever to get the ""good"" ending. And you will die a lot when starting. I recommend Green Hell to anyone who likes challenging survival games.

First of all,
You play as a looney tunes character who should be in a mental asylum.
Second of all, everything kills you.
Imagine you are a piece of toilet paper floating in the sewer, and your goal is to come out clean.
It's impossible.
Everything kills you in this game.
Brush against a leaf? DEAD
Eat with dirty hands- DEAD
You just look in the wrong direction? DEAD
EVERYTHING can kill you.

Secondly- This game is not cross plat.
You cannot play with your XBox or PS friends on a PC.

Thirdly,
You find out you killed hundreds of MILLIONS of people to save your wife AND YOU DON'T EVEN GET TO SAVE HER IN THE END!

So why waste your time with a crappy ending like that leaving you feel like hot garbage and like you're the world's worst husband.

Don't waste your time.

The story line does great at introducing certain aspects of survival and key things to look out for. Every time I pushed out of my boundaries to try to race to finish the story I was harshly reminded that survival was the #1 priority and I had to constantly make sure I was taken care of first before venturing out into the dangerous jungle. I learned very fast, that there are a lot of things out to kill me, even my own body. The story is amazing, I loved the ayahuasca trips, and quickly fell in love with the characters.

- Beautiful jungle and pretty graphics
- Love the exploration as you have many things to find and you really feel lost in the jungle
- The survival elements are fun and expansive
- Decent basebuilding, do not expect The Forest level of basebuilding, but that is to be expected as this game goes for a more realistic vibe
- Game is a bit Trial and Error in the beginning. When you know what each mushroom, plant and animal does. The game generally is pretty easy going with tons of food everywhere

[b] The not so good/bad[/b] 
- The inventory, checking your body and crafting can feel kind of clunky from time to time
- The kids you have to carry with the Spirits of Amazonia expansion... Who came up with the idea to let them scream constantly?!  
- No auto-save or save option when I want to save (only at your base)... Too many times I had to replay 30 min of gameplay due to dying to something stupid. Hidden snakes and spiders giving you poison and with no anti-venom plant in the area = death. The fever is too heavy, draining stamina/hydration way too fast. For example: when you step on snake number 249 you can get rid of the poison rather quickly if you have the right plant leaves to eat, but to get rid of the fever you need more advanced things to get rid off, stuff you usually will not have. Also fever kicks in insanely fast and makes your hydration and stamina drop to nothing in mere minutes. Being in the middle of the map, the fever gives you almost no chance to get to your base that is in the south of the map. And believe me, the map aint that big. Add a jaguar that in 9/10 cases comes out of nowhere and you can reload the last save before you head out on your exploration trip 30 min ago.

All in all a fine game but with some frustrating elements

Jolly good time. 10/10.

Edit: Guess I should give a real review. I really do enjoy this game. It encourages you to go slowly, but you're in a constant race against the clock to keep yourself healthy, at least in the beginning. It can be crazy difficult at first, but once you've learned the plants and animals, what to listen for, what to avoid, and established a bit of a base, you start having time to focus on other goals. You really feel the benefits of having an established base; but at the same time, you have to be ready to defend or flee it. 

Head shots are satisfying. Tool and weapon use feels solid. Crafting is pretty intuitive. The map is interesting and beautiful. I like that you have skill gain as you use items. The seriousness of even a minor scrape is appropriate to the environment. Seasons have an impact on game play.The story is also interesting, though I admit I haven't followed it all the way as I get sidetracked by base building.

Building is occasionally frustratingly buggy; I do hope that the upcoming building patch addresses some of the issues. But the structures feel realistic to build and they've got a decent balance of resources needed for each structure, though I could do with less reliance on long sticks. And I wish we could reinforce our structures to last longer against attack.

Fantastic game; I highly recommend it.",1672238051,1672239751,True,117,10,0.890811264514923096,0,True,False,False

por ahora el juego tiene buenas ideas pero esta repleto de errores tanto anti realistas como absurdos.

primero la performance que tiene el juego es muy exigente, no tengo una pc mala necesariamente. puedo jugar practicamente lo que sea en un rango de fps pasable. juegos de muy alta gama me corren perfecto si no pongo todo en alto.
en este juego los fps maximos que llegue fueron 30. lo que seria jugable y de hecho por gran parte del juego lo es, si no fuera porque todo tipo de cascada o fuego que se carga me parte en dos la computadora. por sacar una antorcha prendida y ponerla en la mano me quedo en 15 fps. esta horriblemente optimizado. las fogatas me bajan un poco menos pero siguen siendo una zona de lag. las cascadas se las aguanta un poco mas y puedo pasar sin mucho problema.
si tenes una computadora de la nasa, el juego seria mas disfrutable.

El mayor problema viene cuando tenes que ir de tu base a un lugar y no volver.
obviamente tenes que tener la salud y los macros altos, cosa de no morir de inanicion en mitad del camino.
pero me genera mucha irritacion lo falso que es la expectativa de vida de un humano saludable armado con lanza y machete. a los pocos metros ya tenes que estar esquivando serpientes, bicho que si te pica tenes que reiniciar el juego o vas a jugar en una ENORME desventaja la cual no vale la pena. y si no lograste guardar una benda estas condenado a muerte. 
bueno ponele que eso tiene sentido, que no te pique una serpiente, que por sierto se ven mas pequeñas de lo que son, al menos las que te matan de una. pero mas alla de eso, el personaje tiene unos problemas para caminar graves. si baja de una piedra de no mas de 4 metros de alto, se rompe todo sin ningun sentido. si hay algo que un hominido hace es trepar, que un decendiente de primate no pueda bajar 4 metros sin lastimarse me parece un chiste.
despues tenes el problema de que no podes correr. a los 3 trotes el señor no puede mas y quemaste todos los macros. no me parece ni cercano a la realidad. tiene sentido que correr con el peso de una mochila te canse, pero si yo que soy un sedentario asqueroso tengo mas aguante que un tipo que se fue al amazonas solo. es claro que no tiene mucho sentido.
la cosa que mas bronca me da es cazar animales vivos. primero no puedo acercarme sin que salgan corriendo a 1000, claramente logico hasta cierto punto. es un poco exagerado que todos corran como si supieran que los vas a degollar al minimo contacto pero por motivos de balanceo ponele que esta bien.
ahora la unica forma de cazar es o con arco y flecha o arrojandoles un arma. 
aca es donde el juego pierde toda logica y realismo, me frustro y cierro el juego para escribir un tomo de la biblia en steam.
alguien que me explique porque un armadillo corrio 50 metros en 3 segundos con un hacha de acero oxidado clavada en la espalda????????
o 1 el hacha no se clava y se escapa (logico) donde agarro el hacha y me voy 
o 2 el bicho corre 5 metros y se desmalla porque NINGUN bicho de 1 metro de largo puede sobrevivir ni menos correr a tal velocidad con un pedazo de metal separando su cuerpo en dos
o 3 se le cae a uno o dos metros porque no le di con suficiente fuerza y el hacha no se clavo.

no tiene ningun sentido que se queden con la herramienta. menos si es una lanza la cual NO SE PUEDE QUEDAR DENTRO DEL ANIMAL Y QUE ESTE SOBREVIVA. es matematicamente imposible que algo tan diminuto pueda tener incrustada una lanza que le separa el disco de la pierna con el torso y que el muy gordo se escape como si nada.

● Immersive and realistic gameplay: Green Hell puts players in a challenging and realistic jungle environment, where they must gather resources and craft tools in order to survive. The gameplay is intense and immersive, and the various survival elements add a lot of depth to the game.

● Beautiful graphics: The jungle environments in Green Hell are beautifully detailed and realistic. The character models are also well-designed and the various creatures and animals in the game are all very well-animated.

● Interesting story: Green Hell has an interesting and well-written story that adds a lot to the game's overall atmosphere and immersion. The game does a great job of introducing new elements and twists as you progress through the story.

Negatives:

● Difficult gameplay: Some players may find the survival elements of Green Hell to be too challenging, as you'll need to carefully manage your resources and make sure you're always prepared for the various dangers of the jungle.

● Repetitive gameplay: Some players may find that the gameplay becomes repetitive over time, as you'll be doing a lot of the same tasks (such as gathering resources and crafting tools) over and over again.

The difficulty curve interestingly hinges to a large extent on your familiarity. If you were to start without reading any guides or walkthroughs and just plunge in, a huge number of deaths are to be expected. But once you know what types of medicine treat what injuries (or how to avoid them in the first place) and what's safe to eat and under what circumstances, it becomes quite easy. I'm honestly unsure whether to recommend reading any guides in advance or just enjoying the grisly process of discovery!

There are two main campaign modes that use the same map, namely the main game and the ""Spirits of Amazonia"" prequel. There's some missing context in the main game that you uncover as you go which I might say is worth experiencing first before trying Spirits of Amazonia. Generally, I found it to be pretty satisfying. The base building is very rigid and inflexible unfortunately. Placing pieces is relatively easy but they're hypersensitive to positioning and obstacles. However, because the game necessitates quite a bit of travel, you'll most likely end up with a lot of vacation homes across the Amazon rather than doing everything from a single main base. The survival mechanics around maintaining different kinds of nutrition are a cute novelty that does keep you from just relying on excessively abundant meat the entire game, but it's fairly trivial once you have an animal trap set up as long as you can meet your hydration and carbohydrate needs. Combat is generally functional enough. Inventory management is limited both by available space and by weight - which is realistic, but sometimes frustratingly at odds with how much the game seems to expect you to carry around to survive.

I'd say the main appeal probably is the sense of atmosphere. Being surrounded by authentic native flora and fauna gives the game a really strong sense of place that helps to set it apart and establishes that you're in a particular, real, detailed geographic region. It can be surprisingly serene between the parasitic infections and leopard attacks too, and the graphics are generally quite nicely done and cohesive (although the ragdoll physics are hilariously wonky in a way I don't count against it). I think anyone particularly interested in really getting to know an environment and building familiarity with it will especially enjoy this one.

The game did at one time have a rather egregious number of bugs (and can still be a little quirky with handling fluids in containers - if you get ""liquids conflict"" on an empty container, try filling it from the source you previously filled it from), but the worst of it is ironed out now, depending on to what extent you consider the building to be buggy vs. just very feature-limited.",1660773697,1672087458,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a great game for everyone who likes survival games.
It has a great flaw though: constant spawning of enemy warrior tribesmen, especially on higher difficulty. This can turn into a genocide game which is sad and ruins the experience.

If played on easier modes though it has an intense atmosphere.
Sometimes, when the ambient noises were changed or I haven't played in a while, I get a mild heart attack because. 
The constant lookout for dangers and that listening to the surroundings is the best way to avoid them, is creating a constant on edge feeling. Even if nothing happens. Gets me everytime.

The game is beautiful, I just love how the light reflects on the leaves and how rainwater drips to the ground. I like details like that. There might be prettier games nowadays, but I don't care. I grew up with pixels, this is art.

I like the more realistic approach, that the player has to check body parts for injuries, different wounds and illnesses need different healing methods, the character needs not just food but different nutritions. There might be other games like this now, but this one was one the first, if I'm not mistaken. After I saw this mechanic in a Let's Play on Youtube, when it was still in Early Access, this is what got me.

The biggest unrealistic issues are the attacks.
Jaguars, as most wild animals, don't tend to attack humans. Unless they are threatened and really have no other choice. I'm always sad when I have to kill one of these beautiful creatures, even virtually.
Caimans are a different story, they really are dangerous and since crocodiles in general have no specific prey (except for few kinds and youngens), the might attack humans. Mostly crocodiles hunt animals smaller then themselves and rarely attack something bigger.
In this regard though it's nice that these animals make noises when they are about to attack. This would not happen in nature, no predator would willingly make noises when they lurk and close in on their prey.
(Same counts for spiders, I've never heard a spider beeing that noisy, but it's a game after all. So by listening, the player can avoid getting surprised by a sudden attack. The constant listening for dangers is part of the atmosphere, it brings certain on edge feeling.)

The warriors make sense, as humans are always one of the most dangerous creatures on the planet. If in any culture they are ought to attack strangers, they will do.
But they most likely will not attack in such waves. It seems like there are endless warriors in the jungle and as other players stated and sceenshots show, these also don't stop attacking. Not even if the corpses of their kind pile up. They appear out of thin air and spawn in the strangest locations. The player often has no chance against them, can't really prepare for the encounters and the only way to survive really is genocide.
This gameplay appears to go against the moral of the story, which is the sad part.

Changing the game's difficulty also changes the behavior or more the number of warrior encounters. Mostly, at least.
But if one wants hard survival, they can't have this experience without going on a killing spree.",1672051849,1672051849,True,1,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

tldr:
The graphic, sound and story is great. But the game is way to easy. If you like to build a base and gather resources, this is for you. If you want to be forced to build a base and gather resources, it's not. Even on survival mode.

Long version:
I only played the story and a few hours survival mode. Didn't try ""Story of Amazonas"". I think I will not continue to play the game.

I started with the story on the 2nd hardest difficulty. The hardest one without permadeath. I did a few mistakes, died, started over, did a few mistakes less, died started over, did even less mistakes and survived. I think I had to restart three times until I beat the game after 28 hours. And 28h is a lot. I bet I could do it now
in maybe 8 hours or even less.

If you get the hang of the basics and listen to your surroundings, there is no threat anymore. The tribe or predators are a joke. Predators constantly gnarl while they stalk and the tribe warriors yell around so one can easily hear them. The predators have to be killed (except the caiman). Never tried to flee from the cats but I think this is not possible. If you have no bow or spear, you can prepare yourself to die now or later from the wounds. Oh you got a few bandages? Then its not a problem. With bow and/or spear, they are just a pain in the ass, because you have to stop and wait until you can see them. Headshot and thats it. The tribe warriors are a bit tougher, because they are three or more (except some who are sitting alone on the ground and sing). I only decided to attack them, if my spear, knife and bow were damaged enough. Then I got new ones of them.

The only ""threat"" later are the scoprions, snakes and spiders, which tend to spawn right behind you or attack from the inside of trees. I got bit two times by a snake which spawned inside a big tree. More often I got bit by scorpions which spawned 10m behind me in a cave which I left 5 seconds before. I was to careless to check the floor AGAIN. But even this costs you just 12h. You have to put a bandage on it and sleep the fever away. With enough water there is no problem.

Base building:
If you have a cave, you only need a fire and a bed. No point in building any buildings. Without a cave, you need a roof for the fire. No need for planting, breeding or defensive structures.

Why?
The only thing you need is a knife, bow, spear and an axe. Build it with obsidian stone. You can hunt, gather fruits and water. Water can be easily boiled [spoiler]inside a turtle shell[/spoiler] and stored [spoiler]inside coconut bidons[/spoiler]. And there is a lot of them around. You can eat nearly everything. There are just a few things you shouldn't eat without cooking them. You even don't need to find nuts, because the tapir (iirc) has a lot of fats in his flesh. If you still go low on fats, search for a [spoiler]yellow nut falling from palms[/spoiler].

Herbivores are way to many around. They constantly respawn every day. On the other hand, there are to few predators even with that amount of possible prey. With so much plant eating animals around it's a wonder you can find any fruits or plants.

Armour?
It's possible to craft armour. But I see no sense in it. Afaik it protects against attacks from predetaors and tribe warriors. As I said before, I never had any probles with them. I still crafted for pieces of [spoiler]Armadillo[/spoiler] armour hoping to get rid of the leeches and the bites from scorpions, spiders and snakes. But they don't protect you from this. Sarcasm: If they would, there would be no threat anymore. One could run through the forest without looking on the ground or listening to the rattle of a snake. 

Leeches!
The leeches are a pain in the ass. You get them. You get them often. Don't understand how but I even got them while I walked on a plain ground without any leafes or water around. And there is no protection against them. You even get them while wearing armour. And because you can still get them, there is no need in wearing armour. I threw them away and played the rest of the story (20+ ingame days) without. Yeah I know it protects against ant bites. But I don't needed ants and avoided them. To be honest, I still don't know for what ants are good though.

Surprise attacks:
Yes they can happen. In my 42 ingame days story playtrough I had them ONLY ONE TIME in a cave I slept. I came back late with 20% max stamina and still managed to kill all 3 of them. Just because they focused on destroying my leaf bed. I was able to take them down with a spear throw and two arrows. I had to wait after each attack, because my stamina was drained. Stupid AI. They could have killed me really easily.

I never had any problems with sleeping in the wilderness any time. If you play this game, you could think the djungle is a nice place for a backpack trip.

What the game is missing or needs improvement (IMO):
1. Mosquitos or other pain in the ass insects which drains the sanity of the player as it would in real live. One could use mud for cover which leads to other problems like parasites or other things.
2. Dehydration. Yes of course you need to drink in this game. But its just a minor thing. If you read the notes from the camp you will find in the story, then it must be real hot there. But I had only to drink once per day no matter if I walked or ran all the day. Take 120 units of water with you and you can go on 2 ingame days until it becomes a problem. If you find some fruit on the way. And you will.
3. Clothes which can be damaged/destroyed.
4. More threat from fauna. No one can tell me, a pile of leafes on the ground protects me from insects which crawl over me while I sleep. Even if I put a few logs beneath them. Stalking cats shouln't make a sound when they prowl. And make them attack while I sleep. Then I am forced to build a shelter!
5. Decrease spawn time of just everything. Fruits and animals shouldn't respawn in a few days. Yes this is a djungle and resources are found everywhere. But not if I am on the same spot for days. If I kill 3 tapirs per day, then they must can get depleted. Same with fruits, sticks, stones, trees...

[b]RECOMMENDED:[/b]  👌  Most Likely

[b]GAME TIME:[/b]    24.7 hrs. recorded


[b]PROS:[/b]
🔹  Exploration
🔹  Weather
🔹  Wild Life Threats
🔹  Health (physical and mental) Threats
🔹  Constant Updates 

[b]CONS:[/b]
🔹 Building Base is a Slack Feature
🔹 Crafting is a poor



[b]EXPECTATIONS:[/b]
My expectations were a bit underwhelmed when I played Green Hell. I expected more from this game, especially its crafting and building aspects.


[b]SUMMARY: [/b]
Overall, it is a good game, and it is quite challenging, but it would be better if there were more building options, in my opinion, the insane mechanism puts this game on another level (if you don't care for the building aspect). Oh, and you got locals to worry about as an added bonus.

I enjoy learning craft blueprints from trial and error or periodically via exploration, it makes the survival aspect of the game a lot more fun. Early on I suffered many deaths while trying to learn the mechanics and objectives, but it helped me prioritize what needs to be crafted and in what order. Once you master the basics of crafting tools and minimally viable staging areas, exploration and survival become a lot easier.

A few obvious tips (without spoilers):
- learn to use the environment and mechanics to your advantage
- while fire isn't essential, it does make your life both easier and harder (heed the in-game warning)
- bring extra water for longer trips
- be mindful of gear durability",1671490375,1671490375,True,0,0,0.491877317428588867,0,True,False,False

1. The bugs.... THE BUGS. I had to redo checkpoints because the save went missing or the checkpoint just didn't work or the cut scene crashed. This was the largest cause of frustration and I was about to abandon the game entirely.

3. The story is.... ok. Nothing fancy, just ok.

One of the most punishing Survival game. If you think the forest a;ready hard, try play this game and you'll die after 3-5 hours in lol. Because the similar nature to The Forest by Endnight games, I will mostly compared Green Hell to The Forest.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+ The graphics Is Definitely the prettiest, the lush, dense forest is really good and telling you in a tropical biomes the best.
+ The story is pretty straightforward but nice and worth to explore (Don't forget the real ending)
+ The Mechanics is much harder than the forest, There's injury that need bandage otherwise it will rot or basically making your characters weaker and crazy, there's illness, poison, rash, worms crawling on your body if you sleep on ground, and making fire needs plow and tinder with 50% chance, etc. It's much denser survival games than The Forest
+ The body needs not only food or water, but fat, protein, carbs. Filling them all is really hard early in game but once you get it, the game is fun
+ Animal variety is so many, not only the tribes is the no 1 threat, but leopard, angry hogs, rattlesnakes, parasites, etc. So many things to prepare with
+ Crafting also bit variable than the forest, There's mud crafting, coconut bidon, Nut bowl, etc. So much to craft.
+ Unforgiving but bearable, way more fun with friends too

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- The tutorial almost tell you nothing than basic button of the game, plus there's no way to know what to make and credible recipes if you not tinker hard enough or looking at youtube guides. You'll guaranteed died over and over until you understand the basics.
- Harvesting items harder than the forest bcs limited carry capacity and slots using mechanics from RE4 and limited weapons slot. Carry more than you can will slow you down so much and you cant even jump. Playing alone almost make the game harder 5x than with just one friend. Almost everything progress much faster with friends.
- The carry problems got worse if you also injured, fever, rash, etc that draining your health and stamina tremendously. So if you need to make so many bases to stock your items or you doomed to death.
- Items disappears when you died except the backpack slots. You got machete, bows, etc that only spawn once, you lost it forever. Need to reload save and have much better plans to avoid this.
- Maps sometimes not 100% accurate, you found a places there's drawing/markings on map but someplace it wasn't accurate, plus we cant add our own markings like bases or explore-able places. Easy to get lost if you don't have good memories of places you walk into.
- The forest sometimes more fun and enjoyable bcs they allow you to make giant structures and things to play with. Plus the jankiness of the AI and glitches is truly one of the charms. But in Green Hell, you can't build things like that. Plus everything is tedious to build alone.
- The harvesting of Liara - The Rope of this game sometimes ridiculous bcs you just cut down the tree but you still have to hold E to harvest it, sometimes it fallen to bad places you can't reach.
- Not every big tree is able to cut down, unlike the forest you can actually create complex or city if you want.
- Some items serve no purpose in main game, until you reach the spirit of amazonia. Then why the devs placing the item in main game is ridiculous. Making us wasting backpack spaces and hoping there's something to craft with it but it can't
- Multiplayer sometimes unstable, so many disconnect and desync that we noticed after playing sometimes. Sometimes making other players other than host lost the long progress they made except it saved on backpacks.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Is it a punishing survival game. HELL YEAH. Is it fun? With friends yes if they all know what they doing and the basics of the game. Alone? NO. Recommended and play with friends or random players...",1640271110,1670579672,True,127,5,0.825101494789123535,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Realistic-ish survival tools / methods / injuries
- Gorgeous scenery / scary jungles / eerie caverns
- Storyline is captivating with excellent voice acting, but can be a little short.
- You can pet a capybara
- Co-op runs pretty smoothly
- navigating with map and compass is a nice change from other games with highlighted objectives

Cons:

I haven't played the story mode yet but I've spent nearly 30 hours in survival mode.  There's a lot of stuff in this game that you can discover through intuition or just standing survival knowledge.  If you spent time as a scout you'll have an easier stroll up the learning curve.

A lot of the techniques used in this game are applicable in the real world, though notably more difficult to use than the gameplay implies.  Some things I'm not so sure of as inspite of my attempts to research them I couldn't find anything definitive.  But it's a game, a great game at that.

Pros:
+Story-rich
+Can be played with friends
+Hard to get bored playing this game
+You learn cultural things that are taken from real life
+You get a new perspective looking at things
Cons:
-The game might be a bit hard for a first timer and solo players.

Green Hell is all fun and games while you get used to the mechanics (which foods do what, what animals do what, what afflictions do what... this was even during a bug the devs took months fixing after an (worthless) update that kept you from recording what plants did what), but then you are left with... very little. GH is known for how hard it is... but it isn't difficult after you get the core mechanics down. After that? Same enemies, same environment, same tools, same threats.... same, same, same. And that's after 1/5 of the game. 

I read a review that said: [spoiler] All you need to do is wall-crawl... [/spoiler] and I thought at the time, ""they can't possibly be right"", but, after playing, yup... they were totally right.

Successful survivals allow the player to push forward through increasing levels of difficulty by way of skill but ultimately require them to acquire new different materials to craft new different things that will help them in the new biome they explore. GH? Nope. You learn everything you need to learn in the first 1/5 of the game, then it's all about finding a MacGuffin that will get you to the next place (and a whole lot of nothing).

And, much like Raft, the narrative/end-game/pay-off just isn't worth it (Raft is, frankly, godawful, while GH is just... meh). There is wild miss-direction on how to get to the end, and, even the ""good"" ending is disappointing. [spoiler] The tone of Mia, whom you are set on saving, is wildly divergent... at once loving and thankful for what you did... and then disgusted, insulting, and accusatory.  [/spoiler]

I really enjoy survival crafting games that have storylines. The Forest was one that captivated me and I didn't like that I couldn't spend an unlimited amount of time just hunting and surviving, but otherwise loved the game altogether. Green Hell gives me that satisfaction of taking my time and really enjoying the survival of the game (not to mention there are a lot of difficult components that consistently keep things interesting and challenging). I like that it leaves EVERYTHING to me -- all the exploration, building, finding new survival tips and recipes along the way.. it's a constant battle for survival and the only one who can muck it up is yours truly.

Words simply can't describe how much I love this game, and I'm stoked to finish the story but I also can't wait to play the other game modes and just test my mettle along the way. I'm positive that multiplayer will be a blast as well. I've only spent about 7h in this game so far and the giddiness and high from that time alone is worth the money.

Bugs are still being fixed! In my original post I thought that support for the game had essentially ended. I won't lie, it's super nice being able to name all the unknown plants, but so far I haven't seen anything that changes my initial conclusions. The big game-breaking problems don't seem to have changed at all.

Original Review:

I do not recommend this game.

The storytelling is great. Early gameplay will most likely kill new players a dozen or more times before they get into the swing of things, but after that it becomes challenging without being overwhelming thanks to customization options.

If that was all, I would be ecstatic. Unfortunately the entire thing is buggier than a Bethesda buffet. Core aspects of the game seem to have been changed at the last minute without any thought to what might break. Several key events required to advance the story simply do not work without a dozen restarts and a crap-ton of cursing.

It's maddening, it kills any enjoyment I might have had while playing that session, and is so consistently broken that any kind of testing at all couldn't help but catch it. Given that the game's been out on Steam for three years, I cannot bring myself to endorse it despite all of the great stuff it brings to the table.",1668521233,1670004901,False,2,1,0.49091532826423645,0,True,False,False

Getting a hang of the mechanics, the meta, starting over again and again, I rage quit. Took me months of abandoning it and coming back before finally getting the hang out things. When I did, not too tricky (""Normal/Welcome to the Jungle difficulty, I know my limits) and I think I love it.

The scenery is great. I didn't notice the beaten paths really guiding you around because they're subtle, and unnecessary, but even guiding you to the first abandoned village was some pretty great level design. I don't feel like my hand is being held, I can explore to my heart's content, it feels like I'm wandering through a strange jungle I haven't seen before.

Threats are easy to manage and avoid or take care of when you learn the tricks. Like every game if you can aim the bow is OP even with basic arrows (I never actually did anything with metal). The notebook is detailed enough to identify cures and plants as well, though much of it requires trial and error. E.g. find a strange plant? Effects unknown till you eat it or try combining it with other things. It may cause or cure food poisoning, you'll just have to cross your fingers, adding to the ""realism"" of surviving an unfamiliar jungle.

The story is... I'm torn. I can poke holes in it, but I'm a sucker for the romance types. I suppose my biggest annoyance is the ineptitude of an anthropologist who has been to this exact jungle before. It'd change the whole story if he was new to the jungle, and it wouldn't be nearly as fun gameplay if they let you know everything an experienced anthropologist should wandering the jungle. It's kind of explained in the story later, but it's not exactly perfect. Also the chance of missing the ""bad ending"" is a shame. I wasn't smart enough my first go to find the good ending, but someone who pays more attention than I do won't have a problem, and the bad ending is what ties everything together.

Overall fun game, and that's what's important. If you enjoy suffering through survival games worth the price tag, if you're a noob like me that may give it up a few times maybe wait for a sale.

Games such as the Forest, that hold a dear place in my heart, seem incomplete when shown next to Green Hell. The development team continues to nurture the game long after its initial release and are constantly adding new content to the game. It warms my heart as a player to know that even if I stop playing, a year from now when I come back, there will be enough content to make it feel just as new as the day I bought it. Unlike huge studios *cough* EA *cough* they have released updates big enough to be entire DLC for FREE. Which is reason enough to buy this game. Simple as. It's incredibly refreshing to see a game that is as dedicated to its playerbase as Green Hell. In a world of Microtransactions and lists of a dozen+ dlc, Green Hell has delivered a COMPLETE experience that contiunes to grow for less than half the price of one that you have to buy fragments of for a year. If this game was a full $59.99 USD I'd still be beyond proud of my purchase.

All things are designed to help your survival experience and after ""completing"" the game, I feel as though both my patience and survival skills have improved IRL.

[u] So let speak on the games strong points. [/u]

Fun in CO-OP/ Multiplayer. Where you quirky problems can be shared and experienced so its not just you going mad.

Visually stunning. This game is like eye candy in a voxel based gaming world. 

GRINDY. Lets just say every building piece or crafting item requires ""JUST ONE MORE"" of something. Poisoned? You'll probably need one more Lily than you have. Building a smoker, better go get one more bamboo stick. You will not be bored trying to survive, that's for sure.

[u] And lo and behold, the negatives below: [/u]

[b] The bugs are infuriating. [/b] Mice and toads will launch you neatly organized stacks of materials into the goddamn stratosphere. Forget stocking things on your house, they fall right through to the ground. Best waste materials and build storage. Wanna try husbandry? Well, only 1.4% of gamers tried, because its buggy as hell. Invisible shit piles will kill off your animals before they even breed.

[b] Rain mechanic? [/b ] The old saying, ""when it rains it pours"" applies here, in metric tons. My buddy and I went a week without rain, then a week with it. Right after we found ourselves complaining about hauling water, we then complained about the constant white noise for days on end.

[b] Dont wasted time building. [/b] I understand the Story mode is not for building elaborate homes or multistory mansions, but boy thinking back you shouldn't do anything past a lean-to and campfire. Hours spent trying to build both ""just useful"" to ""awesome"" things when a coconut bowl and biden is all you really need.

[b] Story. Is this even a story? [/b] If your playing for a story, you're going to be very disappointed by the end of it all. (Hopefully your game doesn't crash during the last cut-scene in multiplayer, like mine did. DEMOTIVATING ASF) It was easy to see where it was leading the story fairly early in the game, but the way it was slapped together by the time you reached the 3rd ""area"", Anaconda Island, left so many holes and yet gave so much unnecessary information.

I will say, having only played story mode, maybe it shines in sandbox. And maybe one day I will try it. But only addressing key mechanics of the game itself I doubt anything addressed above fails to hit the mark with most players. That being said, this game is a real good direction most survival games should go. The grind is absolutely real and that is what kept me coming back for more. But the bugs in the game itself countered most of the joy i felt playing it. Dropping back in saves and losing hours of my life to stupid bugs became a real dilemma. 

All in all I rate a 6/10. Due to an horrendous story, Beta level play-ability, but beautifully designed with Multiplayer. This is not your NEXT GAME experience.",1669476382,1669476382,False,47,1,0.634384274482727051,0,True,False,False

The basic act of building a structure feels much more rewarding than the mindless tree chopping I do in similar games. That being said It does suffers from the same excessive resource requirements for simply things like walls.. and the green hell difficulties does make you feel you need an IV bag surgically attached at all times to cover the dehydration level of your character.

 If you can deal with some of these inconveniences, which exist in many other games of the same vein, the experience is worth it imo.

Previous review

""There are some good things about this game but honestly the amount of game breaking bugs that I've been finding in my recent game has been pretty painful.  For example I was attacked by a piranha while spear fishing, and then couldn't remove the spear from my hand, save the game, sleep, eat, or do anything at all other than alt f4 and that isn't the only bug that I've found.  The fact that this game has been out for years now, and still has game breaking bugs like that and they are already onto expansions and other games is just overall disappointing.  It is a pretty decent survival game but the bugs just take the fun out of it.  I've played a lot of early access games that are in a far better state than this.""

Crafting is awesome, exploring is awesome, hunting is awesome, sleep / hunger / thirst concept is awesome, and the suspense / fear in the jungle doesn't decrease with more game-time. It's very scary walking / swimming around in the dark. Thank god it's just a computer game. I'm a bit skeptical of the 1-hit kills via head shots....

A few additions I would like to see ingame:
More containers: Some place to put bones in would be nice and maybe add the ability to search for clay and use the campfire to make cups, bowls or even big jars.
Garden/Nursery: It would be cool to have some place where you could cultivate either mushrooms, plants or even small animals (E.I. Frogs, rats, larva, maggots, etc.)
Clothes making: Some plants can be used to make rope and even clothes (Hemp, Flax, Nettle) it would be cool to be able to gather that as well as animal skins and work with it.
Survival mode: I would love to have a mode where we have predators and sanity but without the mean men trying to kill us. 

TD;DR: Game's great, go try it and have fun dying every 10 minutes.

Edit:

Loved to see some of the things I mentioned added to the game later on. These new updates are great. Keep up the good work!

The exploration could have been so much fun if the game could let us some time to breath and observe the beautiful landscape and its' inhabitants. Sometimes the lack of options is annoying and makes no sense. Your character has to sleep on a bed and nothing but a bed. You cannot sleep by choice on the ground so enjoy waiting until you pass out when your bed won't be ready in time. The passage of time goes unreasonably fast, and your bars drain equally as fast. Your bed takes a whole day and night in game to make (gather materials, bring them to the location, and assemble it) which is a ridiculous amount of time. And only in 3 days or so in game you can die to insanity, yeah makes sense, doesn't it? Passing out also is not fun and it will be something you will experience very often in the beginning. You have to wait and cannot wake up straight away or skip the black screen persisting after you pass out so you are left looking at it for quite a few seconds doing nothing.

Crazy good game. I`ve built a base for like 40h now and just realized, that i didnt even finished 15% of the story.

 i have this game on both pc and nintendo switch. to start the graphics are great the story im still working on but the voice acting sounds and graphics are amazing. when it comes to switch play its hardly different only a notable but tolerable graphics drop. But even on the switch the game loads quickly and plays well in handheld and docked mode. 

Its a very realistic and beautiful game i can enjoy i prefer the essayist mode as im still learning and its what id recommend others start with.

If you start a co-op game, the one that hosted it has to always be online and launch it (or you have to swap saves manually). This is crap. They already have a server that is launched when you host a game from your PC. Why can't we have that as a separate fileset to put on our own dedicated servers?

You also only join a server through an invite. The server finder doesn't work. This is really bad if you crash in a fight and your friend just can't send an invite, cause they're also fighting. And it does crash, freeze, or get you stuck in some animation/context pretty often.

There are 4 types of ""elements"" (3 nutrient types + water). These drain out super fast. This isn't fun. You spend so much time running from one food station to the next until you can finally head out to do stuff and play the game.

Controls (especially crafting) are silly. So many things attached to separate menus and buttons, when they could've been combined (e.g.: crafting and inventory are two buttons - minecraft had that figured out ages ago).

Plenty of bugs, like desynching of world objects or losing everything in your inventory during a crash.

if you want to hang around the base, building and cooking, but your friends want to do quests. Well... you can't. Or they can't. Everyone has to go there to get the quest working.

Still, it's the lack of a dedicated server that's the dealbreaker for me. Such an easy thing to implement, and it ain't there. But hey - you can name your capybara now!",1668129965,1668129965,False,2,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Tips based on my own experience playing the game:
1. Find a place to build shelter and do it asap. Food source can come in second since you'll be seeing fruits around.
2. Obviously, get food.
3. Listen carefully to your surroundings. 
4. Always have bandages. 
5. Pay attention to your health and always attend to your wounds. ""You will take care of your health in this game more than you do irl"" - a quote from a review of someone
6. I built bases on every area. So whenever I try to explore, instead of going all the way back, I could just go to the base I made on that area to store my stuff, eat, and rest. Made my life so much easier. It's a lot of work but better than dying or getting injured every time you wander around.

Táto recenzia je v Anglickom a Slovenskom jazyku:

The game has a very good and long enough story. Performance is very well tuned and works without problems at full details even on older PCs. So for the price of the game you get enough quality content and I definitely recommend buying it. In terms of gameplay, it's definitely a harder survival game, which I'm very happy about, but this game also has a few flaws (similar to other survival games). Some quests are very hard to understand without reading tutorials on the internet (especially in SoA). The AI ​​(fighters) are quite intelligent, but the combat system is not finished. Basically just hurt them and run away because they don't heal and will die from the injury after a while. There is a large amount of fauna and flora on the map, so finding food and materials is no problem, as you will stumble upon something at every turn. However, on hard difficulty, water and food dwindle at such a rate that you're basically just a cook lost in the jungle doing nothing but food and collecting water non-stop. However, the biggest shortcoming is the imperfect movement of the character on the terrain. The character often gets stuck even on small terrain irregularities (especially rocks) and jumping to high places is sometimes a pain. Overall, however, the quality outweighs the flaws.

Hra má veľmi dobrý a dostatočne dlhý príbeh. Výkonovo je veľmi dobre vyladená a funguje bez problémov na plné detaily aj na starších PC. Za cenu hry teda dostanete dostatočne kvalitný obsah a jej kúpu rozhodne odporúčam. V rámci hrateľnosti ide rozhodne o ťažšiu hru na prežitie, čo ma veľmi teší, ale aj táto hra má niekoľko nedostatkov (podobných s inými hrami na prežitie). Niektoré úlohy je veľmi ťažké pochopiť bez čítania návodov na internete (najmä v SoA). AI (bojovníci) sú síce pomerne inteligentní, ale systém boja nie je dotiahnutý do konca. V podstate ich stačí zraniť a utiecť, pretože sa neošetrujú a po istom čase na zranenie umrú. Na mape je veľké množstvo fauny aj flóry, takže so zháňaním potravy a materiálu nie je žiadny problém, pretože na každom kroku o niečo zakopnete. Na ťažkej obtiažnosti však voda a jedlo ubúda takou rýchlosťou, že ste v podstate len kuchár stratený v ďžungli, ktorý non-stop nerobí nič iné, len jedlo a zber vody. Najvačším nedostatkom je však nedokonalý pohyb postavy po teréne. Postava sa často zasekne aj o malé terénne nerovnosti (najmä skaly) a skákanie na vyvýšené miesta je niekedy utrpenie. Celkovo však kvalita prevyšuje chyby.",1667725473,1667725473,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You must forage food, water, everything you need to survive.  You can play a single player story or just do survival mode. I bought it just for the story and had a good time doing that. It took me 14 hours to complete. In the beginning you dont even have a map but you find 3 along the way. The map is just something you look at, and there is no marker on it tell you your location.

Your wife has givern you a watch that has directional coordinates that you can use to navigate using the map. There is no minimap. I was able to find my way around without too much trouble. Navigation is good via movement with the keyboard and so is combat.

You must fight natives and some animals as well. The settings are very nice because you can turn certain challenges off and on, and adjust how hard each one is. I put the nutrient depletion to low so that water and food lasts longer. You can adjust a lot of things, and its very nice that way. Something that a lot of games are lacking! So I only played the story mode. Im not majorly into survival games, so that was enough for me.

The survival mode looks great for those that like that. You can also have up to 3 other people playing with you in your scenario, It looks like you can save and continue ad infinitum. One session I saw that I could have joined was 120 days, game days not real days, old. There is of course a day and night cycle and you must sleep to replenish your energy.

Other survival things. You can heal wounds by making bandages. You can craft armor. There are things you can make that I didnt even do. As you build things and use tools, your skill increases too.

You could build a big building if you desire. I just made little shelters to sleep and save the game. Thats how you save the game. If youre into building things, like in Skyrim, then youll like that aspect. I did not explore that option. 

If youre into survival games then this game is a must have IMO. Just playing the single player story was satisfying to me, and a challenge.",1667701997,1667701997,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game is extremely difficult. You need to know the different flora and fauna perfectly to have a chance of surviving.
I highly recommend starting the game on low difficulty if, like me, you're not a very patient person. Otherwise, your progress will be extremely slow.

The game mechanics are unclear, I still haven't figured out how to boil water for example. In wanting to be realistic, they sacrificed practicality and readability. This game is quite painful to handle, the ergonomics are bad.

Controls and interface take some getting use to, but just dont worry about dying for your first few hours of play while you figure out all the interfaces. then restart a fresh game and take advantage of the custom difficulty options to enjoy it how you wish. It can be a bit much with default settings at first. Absolute blast with a friend or two. I used maggots from a piece of meat that rotted in my backpack to clean out an infected laceration on my leg, and then 'stitched' it closed with big bitey ants. 10/10. It takes patience to get into... took me a few play sessions to really start to get it and enjoy it, but once i did, it's become an addiction. 

Great survival game, but can be super punishing and confusing at first. Once you get a handle on what's required to survive, good practices for survival, and adjusting your mindset to always have a plan and adapt to changing conditions, it's a blast. I like that the wilderness, GENERALLY speaking, is not 'evil' or out to get you. it's simply alive, and there are dangers that you must learn to exist with. you WILL DIE a lot at the start until you learn to live off of/with the land. you learn to love the rain, rather than fear it, and you learn the importance of placing bowls and coconut shells to capture that life-giving rain water every chance you get. 

If you liked 'The Forest' then you'll probably enjoy this game. It has a much different pace and vibe though, and you definitely feel like you're free to take your time more and settle in, whereas 'The Forest' obviously kind of put a deadline on everything due to passage of days meaning more hostile locals... 

I love the progression from the feeling at the beginning of being scared and useless, and everything seemed so hard... but after a while, you start to become one with the rain forest. you begin to learn all the plants and recognize signs from the environment around you, and you learn to sustain yourself by foraging and taking only what you need. you learn which plants made you sick, and which ones are a tasty treat... you find signs of animals that you can hunt, and learn to spot food sources like good fishing holes, or areas where crabs or birds might hang out for an easy lunch... It's a great feeling to suddenly feel much more competent and like you've grown to be part of the landscape, rather than fighting against it, even though your level of tech doesn't ever really advance much... you simply become practiced at surviving and thriving off little more than the sticks and rocks around you- you learn what to look for as far as viable shelter locations, and you can set up a quick camp anywhere you need to (and hopefully find a meal and drinkable water if you're smart). you still have to adapt though... not all areas are the same, and fighting against the nature of one place or another will almost always lead to your death. you have to work with the nature, or find a more suitable location. there's no right or wrong way... there's only dead and alive. This is something that few wilderness survival style games have really managed to reproduce in my experience. But even as you feel like you're thriving, you're always only one or two missteps or bits of bad luck away from disaster... the jungle is unforgiving, and a fever from an infection or especially bad food poisoning could very well be your demise. The jungle is dense, and you can also easily become lost if you're not careful... panic and frantic movement can lead you to starvation and dehydration if you stray too far from places you know well.

playing with a friend or two is great. it's awesome to feel like you slowly become more primitive and begin to thrive as a miniature amazon tribe.",1667315185,1667356832,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

Sometimes Jake dies of thirst despite being in a tropical rain shower. If Jake can't drink clean coconut water, Jake dies. Jake will get his limbs scratched, cut, poisoned, infected and stung every time he walks 3 steps but his damaged brain means he can't figure out which limb is wounded without  inspecting each one individually. All the leeches in the forest are also in love with Jake. Jake spends half his life removing leeches. Jake has many problems, but he does his best.

This is the game for you then.  I sincerely wish I could get a refund.  There are great survival and base building aspects to the game.  Environment is unforgiving, but not insurmountable.  Combat takes some practice, but is fun.

100% the entirely game ruining experience is getting even slightly lost and pretty much stuck in a death spiral.  The only help you have for finding your way around the jungle, is a longitude/latitude measurement.  No way placing markers.  No maps showing your position. Nothing.  Essentially, the game encourages you to build a base camp, gather nearby resources, and NEVER, EVER, loose sight of that camp.  If you try to wonder out to one of the PoI's in the game, you can either start a whole new camp, or die trying to find your way back.  You can try to build some structures as a trail marker, but not really because you have very limited carrying space.  You have to constantly be eating different nutritional value providing foods, you have to carry a lot of water, and bandages, which takes up most of your inventory space.  The longer the trip, the more you have to take.  So stopping to build is pointless.  Not only that, if you want to remember way points, you have to write them down somewhere.  The Long/Lat is unhelpful, it may as well not exist at all.  If you try to find (for example) 25s, you can get a heading, but that's it.  You'll eventually run into a rock face, or a canyon.  Just go around?  Good luck.  Even if you manage to avoid all the hazards, you are going to spend hours walking around and slowing dying to attrition.  Once your energy gets low enough, you'll only be conscience for a few minutes at a time, your body will fill with parasites, and you die, all because you happened to walk away from your base for more than a few minutes.

All of this could be easily solved with some kind of map overlay, or a way to mark your trail, or anything other that the least helpful way imaginable to try to find your way through the environment.",1666704068,1666704068,False,0,3,0.45267486572265625,1,True,False,False

Inventory and building is quite finicky, so would NOT recommend playing with a controller. A massive downside in my opinion is the survival aspect. whenever you attempt to walk through the jungle, you get a HUGE variety of infections and wounds, and even though the mechanics to cure them are well thought out, you accumulate illnesses by FAR faster than you can cure them. Basically whenever you even get a light scratch, it's worth it to just revert to last save, since it's almost guaranteed that by the time you find the plant that helps, you'll have 6 more problems to take care of. It's extremely frustrating when you're on low stamina and away from shelter, since you begin to pass out every 30s, and accumulate 4 illnesses every time you do. I believe that making helpful resources much more common could help, or maybe make illnesses a probability thing, so it's not GUARANTEED that every time you go into the water you get leeches, or every time you pass out you get worms.

Pros:
+ very immersive
+ great storyline
+ balanced health system
+ extremely realistic (character isn't OP)
+ good skill system
+ theme and character fit the story perfectly
+ realistic storyline


cons:
- there are some glitches that just feel unnecessary
- background doesn't match camera movement
- there is no distinctive clear guidilne throughout the story
- opponents don't get stronger over time and thus the game becomes easier as time goes on

the game overall has it's flaws but they can be overlooked since functionally the game still runs almost flawlessly.
the game is very enjoyable either to be played alone or with friends.

Green Hell was probably one of the least fun games I've ever played. The ending was extremely unsatisfying and made me angry. Even the ""good ending"" we went for sucked. 

The gameplay was very un-intuitive, we were struggling just to figure out how to light a fire, and any time it went out it was frustrating to figure out how to re-light it. There were many points when there was no way to know where you were supposed to go next without using a guide, there was no idea what you're supposed to do next to progress the story. At one point you're just supposed to wander around a big jungle away from the safety of your hut while you're constantly struggling to survive until you get lucky enough to stumble upon some tire tracks that are extremely difficult to see and follow. We could barely find the tracks even with the coordinates from a guide, and then we still had trouble staying on the track because it was so hard to see. My vision is not bad and I really struggled so if you have problems with your vision please don't bother with this game. At night it was far too dark and we constantly felt like we couldn't see what we were doing. Even using torches/fires, it just was to hard to see.

One evening I spent a couple hours running around looking for a poison frog so I could progress the story but they were nowhere to be found and we eventually gave up and logged out for the night. (BTW I only knew to look for a frog at all because of the guide we were using.) When we tried again the next day the frogs were in the exact same spot we had both searched many times over. 

I thought it would be fun to get some capybaras and build a hut and farm, but we never even got around to building more than a basic shelter because we were spending all our time just trying to treat wounds and sickness and trying to figure out how to do basic things in the game. You really spend most of your time treating wounds and sickness, making bandages and looking for something to treat illness. You're picking leeches off yourself literally every few minutes, even in the safety of your hut - why??? 

Even using mods and playing with a friend we found the game to be difficult and just NOT fun. I dont mind when a game is difficult as long as it's also fun, but Green Hell was not fun at all. Halfway through my friend and I were both fed up so we decided to just barrel through to the end because we paid good money for it and we're stubborn like that. We both regret buying it. I honestly can't believe there are so many good reviews, there must be a lot of masochists out there.",1665554758,1665554758,False,3,0,0.498516321182250977,0,True,False,False

Some of the bugs around building are a bit frustrating (mud walls extending downward and overlapping for no reason, being unable to build without an obvious reason why), especially if you are trying to make a nice looking base and you are suddenly unable to place a frame halfway through the build.

It would be nice to be able to ""shift"" some elements around that have already been built, like maybe the farm plots and the mud mixer. Maybe the storage box too, if it is empty.

What a hidden gem! Really enjoying the arachnophobia-canibalism-snakebite-bottomOftheFoodChain-fun.

Game has base building, exploring / navigating. Managing needs (carbs, fat, proteins, water) by procuring food and preparing it (cant eat raw alligators), getting / purifying water.

Recommend to go balls deep and just play on hardest difficulty.

Game has some weird game design here and there doe. Spirit of Amazonia campaign I have this group of 2 skull natives that just spawn EVERYTIME in the bamboo forest next to the river, next to the elder village. THEY SPAWN THERE EVERYTIME.
If you collapse on your bed, in your 2 story building, because you couldnt press use fast enough and it was a really close call - it is the same as sleeping on the dirt floor somewhere in the middle of the jungle. BRUH
Have been killed by that once because got 3 worm infections and was only able to cure 2, didnt find whatever that plant is called, unlucky.

Summary

Why won't my brain produce the happy chemicals? Am I missing something?

Your difficulty options are:
* Boring, uninspired story mode
* Everything wants to kill you
* Everything wants to kill you, and death must come immediately
Also, all of your tools break easily, your scarce food goes bad fast, and you have the metabolism of a hummingbird on cocaine.

Technology advancements make things slightly easier, but the more advanced tools require a level of infrastructure that takes a ridiculous amount of time to build. Then, you have to start over, building a new camp from scratch to advance the story. As if that weren't bad enough, the game doesn't give you sufficient space to build a nice camp anywhere that you'll also be in close proximity to all required resources.

Speaking of the story, why do I care? The two main characters lack personality and chemistry. They're supposed to be married?! Their tragic backstory attempts to evoke sympathy while providing a justification for the situation in which they find themselves, but it's too shallow and generic to be engaging.

Maybe I just dislike survival games as a category. I need my games to be an escape from reality, so ""work hard to get nowhere, and face the constant looming threat of your own horrific demise"" seems more like a description of being a Millennial or Gen Z'er in the USA than a fun game.

Not only it glitches and crashes randomly, but also in-game mechanics are not exactly the best.

For example I don't understand why game has an urge to rearrange things in the backpack every time I load a save.

Another annoying thing is placing or collecting things: sometimes you have to run around for minutes looking for the right angle to place or pick an item. Not once I dropped a bigger fish back into a trap because there was no space in the backpack and could not retrieve it back later, or dropped an empty mold back into the mixer and had to leave it because it was just not possible to pick it up. Or running around a tree with blue mushrooms trying to find a certain angle from which the game will finally allow me to pick the mushroom...

Spawning and despawning seems to be quite random: sometimes a knife I dropped and forgot for a bit despawns after some short time, but garbage I left behind stays there forever.

And it is not just game mechanics. Also both endings left me quite disappointed. I had to find and read the whole story, because I had more questions than answers about the whole story after finishing both parts.

Seriously, I got a friend who's also a big survival game freak like me, and for so long have we searched far and wide in the abyss of the Internets for a game that really suited our expectations, which can be summed up as simply as; immersiveness, and beautiful scenery. That’s literally it. And Green Hell serves it all. 

So in a random order I just made up because why not; 

Skill development. I want it to be there, but I’m not the type to ask for a really complex tree where you have to strategize with your attribute points and all that fuss. Green Hell has a beautifully simple and effective way and I absolutely love it. You just get better at what you do. That’s it. It goes slow, but that’s good for me. It’s useful, realistic, and easy, and the development speed is at a good pace for my taste, which is on the slowish side.

Hunting. First of all, that music that starts playing when you throw a spear and land it on an animal but it doesn’t kill it and it starts running away and you run after it and it’s just going right and left in the busy undergrowth OH THE THRILL OF IT. Sometimes I can’t find them and I lose a spear as well as precious meat but hey that’s all a part of the hunt. Thanks to the skill system you can’t just pull up a bow and some arrows and start bringing mass extinction on your second day in the jungle. Good balance, fun pursuit, and rich rewards when successful. Another hardship which I found myself masochistically enjoy is that the fish in a lake won’t be just circling around in a predestined path, they actually move around, and sometimes they have a spot where they gather up but the next day you go there and you find them way on the other side just swimming around doing fishy business. Neat. 

I’ll give a good immersiveness badge on environmental variety because the jungle does look beautiful, but I feel like there could be more. This is not a complaint, I’m fine with it as it is. Maybe a couple of more tree species and definitely some more animal species can be added. For example so far we only came across one species of snake. Should definitely be more snakes. Never enough snakes. 

Weather. This is gonna be a gold star for trying. But I do remind myself and anyone reading this is that this is still an early access game. Just that right now the rain comes and goes as if with a switch but hey, early access, not our first rodeo. Mostly though it’s that the rain drops are almost invisible so it’s sometimes hard to tell if it’s raining or not. 

Food and other needs. This one makes me really happy so throwing another good immersiveness badge here I mean looks like there’s more where they come from sheesh am I loving this game or what. Well I find all the survival mechanics in this game feel so natural and smooth. Green Hell has a simple and efficient and real enough system with fat, protein, carbs, and water needs. Sleep is also really well done I think, in fact it works so good that after one point my friends and I (who are playing on coop sandbox survival mode on Welcome to the Jungle difficulty) realized our eating/sleeping cycles have become like real life. You need that wholesome breakfast in the morning if you want it to be a good day. And a good afternoon nap is always useful. I mean, how much more real can that get? I do wish though there was more realism to the needs like poopin. Yes pooping yes I said I want to poop in my video game yoU KNOW WHAT YES I’M THAT GUY. When you think about it pooping is actually a big part of our everyday survival (Tried not pooping for a few days? That sh*t can kill you.) Plus you can use it for fun activities like throwing it on your friend’s face. No? Never done a poop fight? Live a little. Also on this topic I want to say the treatment of wounds and infections is just beautiful but I’ll let you discover all that for yourselves. The game doesn’t give you a helping hand in everything either. You have to learn what the healing herbs and useful ingredients are and look like, they won’t be shining up for you or even have their names written of top of them. Once you discover something it’ll be added to your notebook but the fact is, you’re not running around looking at pictures of herbs in your notebook, you have to remember them. Otherwise you just pass by so many blessings of the jungle. 

Crafting. One random thing I like: when you “craft” something, your character goes on to pretend like he’s doing something with his hands and ayy so cute I love that. It’s a very basic animation where it looks like he’s just learning to dance to disco music and is very confused about it but still kudos for trying. The craft system is a lot like the one in The Forest, with a little difference here and there but certainly all a success for me and my likeminded friends. I like that you start the game with some craft recipes in your notebook but then you add more to it as you discover stuff yourself. I like to discover. Thank you for letting us discover, Green Hell devs. Base building, so far so awesome. It looks a lot like how that one guy on youtube with the primitive technology videos does it. And I am a fan, if you couldn’t already guess that. 

Group work. This is a good one because the difficulty of the game is at such a balance that, yes you can survive on your own, but having friends just makes things so much better, unlike some other survival games where my friends and I would find ourselves not interacting with each other like not asking for help or team working, because hunting and building and gathering was so easy that everyone would end up doing their own stuff at some point. Here I find that it’s only when we deploy task distribution that we go off and do things on our own, but it’s still part of the team work. It’s incredibly fun to play with friends, I’ll say that. 

Exploration is really rewarding. My friends and I have played for 11 hours so far and the desire to go explore is strong, and every time we go out it’s always a fun time. Not just the items you find, but the whole oh sh*t we got lost, where’s the river, SNAKE!, aw nice view, omg look at that, let’s go this way, take a screenshot of me here, hunt, run, bandage, ANTHILL!, run, ooo nice spear, new craft recipe wooo!, and all that, is all really fun. I don’t know for how long it’ll keep going but it looks like it’ll make it far enough that I won’t feel like I wasted my money. 

Last point before conclusion; there needs to be a female character. YEAH YEAH PUT A CORK IN IT. All you feminism haters don’t even know what you’re hating on. Look, it’s 2020, don’t even wanna talk about it all over again, and I know that in single player the story goes around a man (much surprise) and maybe that’s not easily changeable, but at least for the coop there can be a female character that we can choose. Or even not choose, just like one does not choose to be born, or rather become, a woman, or a man, it’s okay not being able to choose your gender in game if that makes things easier for the devs to assign randomly. Again, I don’t know how difficult that is in terms of programming and design but, come on, worth it. 

So finally to conclude, yes it's always a labour to keep yourself healthy and leech-free, keep an eye out for the predators and crawling menaces of the jungle (respect though like that's their home turf) and just be on alert most of the time, but all this comes with really nice and immersive tools that are very helpful once you learn how to do things efficiently, and it’s just So. Much. Fun. I really recommend going into this game not having read any guides about it and just discover it all by yourselves. And stay hydrated. And wash your hands. No joke.

2022 edit: Base building sort of disappointing. Need more. MORE. More construction blocks (the mud walls look awful when dried), more decor/furniture. Definitely a must. Please devs. Please make this the next big update.",1588767456,1664910176,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

They have inflated the difficulty of the game by simply not explaining the mechanics or having a good enough tutorial. Took me 2 hours of game play to figure out how to make small stone from big stones, since that was all I could find anywhere. That is not challenging, it's just bad design to not explain the basic mechanics of how to gather certain items. 

Have not been able to make it past day 1 or the starting area yet, because while trying to collect the few stones needed to make an axe, I am constantly bombarded with status effects. Status effects which I do not know how to cure yet since I was literally 5 minutes in after the tutorial. They're everywhere, I walk 5 ft in any direction and instant status effect. If not a status effect, then I run out of water too soon and I still haven't even been able to make a damn fire, let alone figure out how to get water so early.

There is a small tutorial that simply does not explain the basics of survival in this game well enough. It's bad design and needs improvement. I don't feel like I'm being allowed to play yet, simply because I don't know the controls/mechanics for any of the basics.

Will update this after I've taken a break from being so annoyed and given this another shot, but so far highly unimpressed with this. I heard great things, but it's a massive disappointment so far as it has provided zero challenging game play. Just artificially inflating difficulty by keeping you in the dark of how to play.

Update: 4 more hours in and still the same things, have not been able to construct anything. Had to turn on console commands to deal with the status effects since I've been infected by random things over 80 times now. For real, 80+ times in less than 7 hours of game play just trying to learn the mechanics and craft the most BASIC items. Seriously, this is the worst design ever. This game is not challenging, it's a waste of time.

After the tutorial, you are dropped in with nothing and while just trying to learn you are constantly bombarded with status effects every 2-3 minutes while walking through the terrain collecting basic items to make your basic tools. Took me until the 4-5 hour mark before I found a coconut to make a flask. Can't use that to boil water though. It doesn't work, so I'm guessing you need another item but the game does not tell you what is needed to do so. So I'm stuck dehydrating all the time because if you drink water that isn't boiled you get more status effects.

This game is not challenging or hard at all like so many supporters claim it is. It just doesn't tell you how to play. If the difficulty of your game is only in keeping players ignorant of mechanics, it's horribly designed. If I have to use youtube/google to learn to play your game, it's horribly designed and that quite literally takes all the fun away.

Not sure if I will continue at this point. Maybe I'll try again in a month or so when I'm ready to waste more of my time.",1663662055,1663748089,False,8,3,0.541198015213012695,0,True,False,False

To me, this is the gold standard of how the early access business model should work. From the get go, I thought this game had some pretty nice polish to it, even in very early access. Frequent updates and hotfixes kept it very stable and showed a nice flow to the the dev team's progression. I enjoyed the base mechanics throughout the process and also building in this world in both story and sandbox modes. Some pretty solid NPC AI with the local tribes as well. As elements were added, the game got better and better. 

Then it was ""finished"". The game was released with a full and compelling story mode. At $24.99 US, I had already gotten well more than my moneys worth and loved the game and its process.

You start lost in a jungle, needing to find some sort of immediate life-supporting nutrition divided into 4 categories only certain foods will accommodate. Not to mention trying to treat your infections/wounds/ailments when you go forth and find your way through the jungle if you're playing the story mode--which i must say was so fascinating the first time i played it.  

The only thing I would say for this game is to make even more ailments that can go wrong (really go big!) I wanna 'break my leg and hobble or rest for a few days for it to heal and impair me for a while after' kind of additions.

Every single time you quit the game, your video settings will be reset. Namely, V-sync and fullscreen options, and since this game is quite poorly optimized. On a positive side, forgetting to go to those settings every time you start up the game, your PC will go into VROOOM mode and you can use your PC as a stove, or even a microwave, all thanks to this fantastic game!

It does not quite end there. This game lacks a LOT of video settings that are pretty much present in almost every other game, but not here. For example: there is no toggle for motion blur in-game. It is ON by default and you cant normally disable it (someone posted a way to disable it by rclicking the Green Hell in Steam library, going to general settings and adding the line ""-noblur"" in the launch options. Props goes to whoever wrote that).

Another weird feature of this game is, that it does not despawn majority of the items in the game. Every time you throw away some garbage on ground you no longer need, it will remain there until end of times, adding additional load onto the system. Every single stick, every single bone, every single coconut bowl you throw out of your inventory will be there, somewhere, you wont know it, but your PC will. An immersive feature, but not exactly performance-friendly, and there isnt an option to disable this either.

Crafting system is just awful. You discover crafting recipes by randomly combining items together. Something similar that Minecraft had ages ago. Simply put, if you wont look up online how to craft certain things, you will never know how to craft them, since game wont tell you. Me and my friend played for quite a long while without armor, because, we simply didnt know how to build it, which led to us constantly dying to wounds caused by hostile animals. There is very small chance someone will figure out how to craft the armor, as one of the items needed to craft it, can NOT fit in your inventory. As a matter of fact, there is a lot of good stuff you can craft out of items that you cant put in your inventory. You can carry them, but not actually have them with you. You have to drop them on the ground, grab and drop them in crafting menu and there you put the remaining items.
I will give you a quick small useful spoiler, the item you need to craft the armor with is a ""banana leaf"". I had to discover this information by looking it up online. Because, simply, game will never tell you that there even is armor you can make to begin with, other than from the one steam screenshot that has it.

To be clear, I DONT think this is a bad game. As a matter of fact, I think its really good, worth the price, however, with these issues present i simply can NOT recommend it in its current state.

Difficulty is expected in any survival game, but it's used to add undeserved length and depth to a game seriously lacking them. The difficulty is inconsistent, unrealistic, and in places just seems mean spirited. Often times the game forces you to take ""the long way around"", just as a time sink. Crafting is ridiculous, to the point of having to manually click and drag things individually onto what I assume is a trans-dimensional crafting-rock, given how seriously the game wants itself taken. If the only time you are realistic is when it inconveniences the player, then you are not trying to make the game honestly difficult. You're my manager at Michael's who refused to let us use the quantity key. 

Now let's talk about options, or the lack thereof. This game expects you to play a certain ""way"". From the inescapable options to the terrain and building snaps, it has a plan for you and doesn't really want you to step too far outside the box. There is a heartbeat..... I hate it, it's like the beep-beep in Legend of Zelda, and my dude constantly comments on how hungry and thirsty he is. I finally turned the sounds off because insta-death from things sneaking up on me was preferable to the annoyance. There is no option to disable any of this enforced tense atmosphere either. Let me turn off all the commentary and B.S. without also turning off the dangerous wild-animal sounds you assholes. I honestly can't think of a better definition of failure of purpose than what you did there. Put a slider in options, type Voice under it in a label, and then attach it to the right listener. 

Then there is the building system. I've only gotten to brush up against it so far, but from what I've seen it's more of the same. Each bit of wall has snap points and it's impossible to build a structure without them. The snap points aren't universal either, some half wall won't snap to my shed no matter how hard I try. I must assume this is an illegal use of long-sticks. In other words the game has decided the proper way to use the things you build (selective ""realistic"" difficulty again). Terrain however is irregular and indestructible. and from what I've seen the pre-generated structures are immutable as well. You can do ONE of these two things, but cannot do them both together and expect it to work. 

There is also the player's condition. There is a system of different nutrients you need to have to be balanced; fats is one, carbs another, it's all an interesting idea. There are also sleep and sanity, also interesting in an Eternal Darkness kind of way. Lose enough sanity and a hallucination shows up and kills you (?) I guess. It's not a cool hallucination either, just ordinary and boring. Not exactly realistic, but what have we come to expect. The game is only realistic to make itself harder, and unrealistic for the same reason. Which brings us to sustenance. Between sleep, nutrients, and a bevy of other difficulties my dude passes out more often than an Edwardian Broad in a tight laced corset. When you pass out you lose  things, like an ax. Losing things when you pass out next to your own fire is infuriating, and once again not very grounded in realism. This is another of the situations where you can have one or two of these things, but all together they are awful. 

This feels like a game with no identity outside of an artificially difficult, detail oriented clone of any other survival game; it's Minecraft someone slapped some graphics on. I know you devs wanna make a game, and you have a whole sack full of interesting ideas that will work if you put them together just-so, but if you take all those ideas and put them in one hand, and then poo in the other, imma tell you which one gets full faster. 

Lastly, all of these criticisms wing in a tightening gyre around one central cirticism: self determination. A survival game is not an excuse to make people play the game ""the right way"". It's a chance to for players to show off all the innovative ways they manage to survive, or more likely die.   

You devs start doing things like letting me turn my very atmospheric heartbeat off and I'll stop regarding you with such suspicion.

Purists who've played it from the beginning will tell you that ""It's realistic"". Yeah, sitting in the comfort of your home punching buttons on a keyboard while colors flicker on a flat surface in front of you is very close to actually being in the Amazon rain forest... Phooey. Games should be fun first and foremost.

""Realism"" in games should always take a backseat as designs ""inspired"" by it often leads to grinding and long-winded game mechanics that serve no purpose other than to frustrate the player. I'm not saying a game shouldn't let itself be inspired by how things are done in the real world. But it is very easy to take it too far. Green Hell does take it too far in some places in my opinion sometimes making the game feel like a chore to play.

Now, with that out of the way, the game is good! And when it doesn't grief you, it's actually really good. There's lots of exploration and adventure to be had in the world of Green Hell. And the story seems intriguing enough that I look forward to unraveling the plot as I go along.

I recommend playing it on custom difficulty and setting needs to low and combat to easy. Enable all encounters and disable leeches (a great example of a ""realistic"" mechanic that is ONLY annoying). With these settings you will be able to enjoy exploration, but still have to look out for snakes, big cats and so on. But you won't incessantly be forced to focus on your ""needs"". But it's there and needs attention once in a while, which can then be interesting enough.

It will also allow you to focus on base-building. It will also allow you swim in the water without having to remove leeches every 20 seconds (because that's just so much fun!).

Enough ranting. I recommend the game. The progression is pretty seamless, which is a good thing. And it allows you to pretty much play the way you want, as long as you don't play on the higher difficulties.",1662495672,1662495672,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When you first get going just staying alive is tough, any mistake or lapse in concentration can kill you, drinking dirty water gets you parasites, forgetting to wash your hands before you eat? Have some parasites. You didn't look where you were going & stepped on a rattlesnake? Now you're poisoned and have a fever. When you pass out from the fever you wake up and a worm has burrowed under your skin. You best dig that out before it gets infected...

Once you get used to day to day survival  the jungle itself becomes less daunting and the tribesman become the real threat, but again with some practice you'll be taking down groups of them without trouble.

The wound system & food system have some good depth. 

With wounds you need to find the right healing items for the type of wound. Antivenom/Antihistamines/anti infection all have their place.

With food you have to stay on top of your proteins, carbs, fats & hydration. So you need a varied diet to stay healthy.

It's a really great survival game and the story mode was a really nice surprise, it's good & hits the right notes to get you invested.

Life 1: Explored a lot, became poisoned by touching a frog, became sick by drinking dirty water, failed to craft anything, collected about six different types of mushroom, was stabbed to death at dusk by a painted native warrior guy who emerged from the bushes.

Lives 2-5: Figured out basic crafting, including an axe, a shelter, a campfire, and a throwing spear. Managed to live from 1-3 days each time, even killed some animals and cooked their meat. Came to understand that there are MANY ways to die, and MANY specific ways to survive the perils (eg. get bitten by a venomous snake, you'll need to find a particular type of plant or mushroom that works as an antidote. Figuring out WHICH is often a matter of trial and error, therefore you will die many times in early game (starvation, madness, lack of sleep, dehydration, sickness, poisoning, injuries) as you learn what resources you need in order to deal with a variety of threats.

Life 6: Cracked it! Lived several days, crafted armour, a meaningful base, had animal traps in place, had water collection options, fought off some natives in the night, developed improved weapons, resource managament and stable vital signs all completely sorted! Got bit by a spider and died because I didn't know which flower to eat.

This is a beautiful PvE experience, and it feels like there is a lot to go at in terms of crafting and developing more advanced ways to survive.

But the story is terrible, some simp lost in the amazon. Theres nothing to really do, its just an empty map caves are empty, you finally find a new site and its also empty. Game felt like I was just running around pulling leeches off of me. 

I recommend the forest, things they got right was gore, which this game needs terribly. A good story, scary enemies, more tools and items. Caves and new sites leave you in awe from the horror. 

This game just has jaguars that come out of no where and attack randomly, after you kill one another will pop up 10 minutes later thats the only real threat the natives are easy to kill even on hard mode. So theres no sense of fear its just boring. 

They need to add gore, lots of it. Have heads on spikes, dismemberment. Have different types of natives, some with  masks maybe and some stronger and faster. Blood is non existant. Just wasted potental",1560936620,1661278852,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I actually found it just as fun to play with friends as solo, but there's definitely a difficulty scale when you've got other people helping you out to gather/build/fight - everything does happen faster and easier, so crafting is a lot less painstaking if you've got someone devoted to deforesting and someone else churning out mud bricks.",1661068377,1661068377,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I would say this game is more for hardcore players if you are interested in seeing everything it has to offer. If you aren't into playing hardcore survival, there is a story mode and an easier difficulty mode. Overall I recommend this game to anyone that likes survival games. It isn't even super popular, but I hope one day this game grows a lot. I would like to see this game on sale at some point; that might get a little more people to recognize this game.

Honestly, the story is great, and the game is visually impressive. That's about it. That is why I can't recommend it.

The ""tutorial"" is just the prologue and doesn't actually teach you any of the critical game mechanics. It doesn't teach you how to harvest large rocks to get stones, or that you can throw said stones at coconuts at the tops of trees to knock them down. It doesn't teach you about any of the actual building mechanics. It doesn't teach you how to make weapons, or that you can open the crafting window and drag items on the ground onto your crafting rock.

Building is almost completely pointless. Following the story takes you all over a large map and there's no reason to ever return to a previous location, so you spend time building a base, then never see it again. The only thing you actually need to build is a bed on the rare occasion when you are too far away from ones in important locations. Nothing else is actually useful. Most of the buildings that would actually be mildly useful are only found as you progress the story. You can't make a second story to your buildings unless you happen to harvest mud from a water source. You can't even build a floor to prevent worm infestations.

Resources are also generally pointless. Fill up the loops on your bag with ropes and sticks and that's all you'll need to finish the story. Foraging for food is only needed until you get to the drug factory. After that you can find all the processed and packaged food you need at the important locations. Keep a pair of stone axes, a spear and a stone knife on you and you have all the tools you'll need. Replace a stone axe with the machete at the drug factory.

I have no idea why the devs touted this game as some amazing survival game with a groundbreaking building/crafting system, then made those things almost completely irrelevant. The first small village you come to should be a central location on the map, with the rest of the important locations spread out around it. That way at least you'd be able to build a base that was relevant for more than 15 minutes. Head out to an important spot, do what you need to do, then head back to your camp for rest and resupply.",1660973189,1660973189,False,0,0,0.449438214302062988,1,True,False,False

I may have even got emotional a few times (which is rude to put in a survival game).  It was one of the best stories of a survival game that I have played.

Sounds/music is excellent.  The exception is for the positional part of it... It's hard to tell where a sound came from when hunting animals.
The story is dramatic and fun to follow.
The bad parts of the game:
Alot of the tech tree is completely useless and mostly a waste of time.
In a four player game, we felt like establishing a base and gathering / constructing was more risky than just moving along the story so we only made minimalist settlements 3-4 times during the game.
The fun also stops at the grind.  For example, if you want to make iron tool (mid/late game), you need soooo much wood to create charcoal, and the first ones you build will probably break faster than your rock ones because you got good/better at making those.  Lastly the in-game tutorial is lacking, you constantly need to check the wiki to find what's keeping your from building/doing something.  In multiplayer it even happened once where we learned a technology while no one knew how we managed to do it...
*BUG* We managed to get stuck at an infinite loading screen after trying to leave a military tent.  We fixed it by asking the 4th player who was doing something far from us to join us in the tent and to try leaving too. It fixed the problem but it was a waste of 10 minutes.
The part I was the most mad about was when I was alone in our makeshift camp and got attacked by 4 tribal warriors and they started destroying our chests, furnace, mud mixer and planter box.... It felt like an unnecessary part of the game loop.",1660591967,1660592746,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

One major difference from the others I've played is that there is an ACTUAL story.  Many survival games are great, but the goal is really just survival.  While that's an option in this game, it does have quite an engaging story line.  

The survival mechanics all mostly make sense too, there's a weight limit AND a space limit in your bags, the fights aren't easy, and you could very easily die, but you can also easily strategize against it.  The building (while it can have it's annoying parts) is also very well done in my opinion, and you see it being built part by part.

The base campaign feels lonesome at times, but you're in the jungle, it works out. The story is a simple one, nut with enough love and care poured into it.

Now, the Spirit of the Amazon (SoA) campaign. The additional maps have been designed better than the base campaign, Not only are they more interesting in general, but the layout is more on point, and nothing feels to be on your way too much. It can feel huge when you don't have a grip of where you stand, but once you know the map a little bit, going from one corner of the map to the opposite is not that bad.

I only played the game in the normal difficulty. Combat was not very exiting, the AI of the Waraha was quite lack-luster, specially if you come from something like The Forest (which I feel is less polished than Green Hell, but damn it, The Forest retains you with AI alone).

What I can say is, this is one of the deeper, more involved survival games out there; having multiple kinds of 'hunger' to track and balance, multiple status effects that have different impacts and feel important to resolve, and a pretty large map without quest markers or minimap (and indeed, the only in-game map is just that - a map with important locations sketched on, but without a player location indicator).

Only real complaint I have is the UI.  Awkward, clunky, and often requiring two different interfaces open at the same time to do anything, it's the real learning curve here. For example, if you get bitten by a spider, you have to first open the body examination tool, then open the backpack. If you open your backpack first, the body examination will close it. 

The information delivery is usually good (hovering over something you've eaten shows you all the effects you've discovered from it), but the gradual (and sometimes seemingly random) unlock of crafting and building recipes means you have to wander the physical world and just kinda stumble across a lot of the valuable recipes and structure blueprints that make an actual established base worth making.  Even then, because so many buildings have somewhat squirrely collision and building requirements, it can be hard to make anything big or broad.  You quickly learn that getting too settled anywhere, even in survival mode, doesn't actually serve you that well because the world is so big and anything you don't have nearby takes a LONG time to fetch.

There is, especially early game, a distinct awareness that you're squishy and taste good.  The UI and crafting and food needs learning curves make your first few play attempts almost guaranteed failures (I probably died five times before I made it to my second night)...but once you get the hang of it, learn what things give what nutrients, and climb the crafting tree a little bit...it's a really good experience.

The story itself is interesting, and has some really neat twists to it.  The lack of guidance on how to get from one step to another is a little frustrating, however, given how large the world is and how easily you can miss something important just by climbing the wrong side of a hill.  The map is EXTREMELY difficult to interpret if you don't have any map-reading experience or skills, and the game doesn't really tell you that you have a compass on your watch so you can end up running in circles a lot.  Learning how to track landmarks, or what you could use to mark where you've been and where you need to go, also takes time.

But with all that, this is still one of the first games I suggest to people, especially streamers, who are looking for a good survival game.  Not for the faint of heart or the easily discouraged. Save often.",1660401104,1660401104,True,13,1,0.642614543437957764,0,True,False,False

I DO NOT run mods at all, preferring to play these types of games vanilla as the developer intends. 

The Good:
1. Game-Play and combat are both very fluid, feels great to play on PC.
2. Graphics are very nicely done - Looks Amazing
3. The sound is great. Can easily hear the direction of a large cat sneaking up.
4. Developer is consistently releasing new content.

The Bad:
1. Unintelligent AI -
 The AI isn't that intelligent. Once you figure out how the AI behaves and where things spawn, the game get's a LOT easier. If you walk everywhere you can hear most things from a mile away. A big cat like a Jaguar or Puma will growl quite loudly EVERY TIME, and you can simply turn to the direction where you hear the sound, and line up a head shot. 

2. Diversity -
 Lack of diverse NPCs.  Almost every tribes person looks the same with little variant. Jaguar and Puma are basically the same just different skins, and only a few hunt-able animals. 

3. Everything is Unknown -
Almost all herbs and mushrooms are unknown. I understand it being unknown when you first pick it, but can't your character at least name it something in your inventory? Like instead of Unknown Mushroom, why not put it's actual name, or even something like Orange Mushroom? 

4. NOT Realistic - The things that are not realistic are VERY unrealistic.
Not as realistic as I thought it would be. So yeah you can get infected from wounds, and use different bandages to wrap those wounds, which is nice. However my guy shouldn't eat 4 steaks and then be STARVING like 4-6 hours later. Hungry yes, but not so weak he wants to sleep all the time. Nutrient depletion is way to high in default setting, and just becomes tedious.

This guy also doesn't get stronger or build more endurance. He can spend a year in the jungle and still not be able to carry more than 50 lbs, or chop down more than a few trees. 

5. Animal Husbandry - Seems like a punishment - and there is absolutely no need.
So the premise sounds nice, but the delivery is awful. Now there are bugs, which is understandable with a new content patch. Animals disappearing or escaping their pen is one such bug.

HOWEVER having animals in general seems like a punishment rather than a benefit. You CONSTANTLY have to provide them with food and water, and pick up their droppings or they will eat them and get poisoned and die.

They REALLY missed the mark with this one. The point of these kind of game-play mechanics is usually to benefit the player, not make them constantly micro manage some animals. Why would I want to spend my time constantly gathering food for MY food when I could just walk a few feet and kill 2-3 in the wild? 

Animals in general don't eat feces unless they are young, and if they do they usually don't get sick. I mean there are outliers, but if most animals behaved this way and got sick and died this often because of this, well there would only be a handful of species on the entire planet. 

On top of that, there are way to many animals out in the wild in this game to really warrant trying to raise your own.

6. The building system - very lackluster/simple and problematic
So yeah, I get that they want the building system to be simple, and they use a Modular + Ghost/Blueprint system.  Problem is you can only place one bp ghost at a time when making a building. This makes it very difficult to try and map out a base. You have to place a ghost, finish it, then snap on another ghost and finish that and so on. Well if the area you were building is at a small incline, you might not end up being able to finish the building how you planned. NOT to mention the fact that sometimes the ghost just won't snap to your building pieces for no apparent reason. Also there seems to be multiple snapping points that are not always easy to detect, and can make HUGE problems later down the line when it's too late to do anything about it other than chopping down your base and starting over.

Building is a HUGE part of the survival genre and this system is terrible. What worries me is it seems like they are adding new pieces soon, and haven't fixed the current issues that plague their building system.

7. No Ability to have Dedicated Servers -
Dedicated servers are HUGE for this kind of game, and for some reason the developer is vocal against having them. The multiplayer is Peer to Peer, which means one player hosts the game acting as the server, while their friends join them. Problem is the host has to be online for their friends to play.

A dedicated server acts as the host, so people can come and go as they have time. I'm not saying the developer should shell out the money to host official servers themselves, but allowing players, and companies to host their own dedicated servers seems pretty standard for the survival genre - and I'm baffled the devs seem so against it. I'm not sure if it's because they lack the skills to do so or what.

8. BUGS - There's some game-breaking ones that have been in for YEARS

A. Can't use in-game menus -

One bug I've gotten about 3 times so far is right after combat while my bow is equipped (have only experienced it with bow so far) , I can't open any of the in-game menus. Not inventory, or character inspection. This means that if I got hit during the fight I can't heal my character. I end up having to save + quit (ESC menu still works)

B. Coconut Shell not Working - 
I harvested a coconut, and then harvested the shell instead of eating the inside out first, and when I placed the coconut it would disappear most of the time. Then if it didn't disappear it wouldn't catch water or work at a cooking station. The coconuts I chopped then ate while still on the ground seemed to work just fine. Couldn't replicate with other saves, but happened consistently with this save, so not sure what caused it.


C. NPCs walking through base walls -
Not sure what caused this bug, or how wide-spread it is,but enemies, animals and human alike can walk through your base walls. So you'll get pinned inside your base getting hit by a tribes person or large cat, and will be unable to put a gap in between you because you can't walk through walls.

I've tried verifying my steam files, restarting PC and still happens. From searching Google I can see that this bug has been around since at least 2018 and hasn't been fixed. The answer I got from a guide in their official Discord channel ""It must be complicated and has to do with physics"". Now there are work a rounds like building a wall of palm leaf stands around your base which I don't believe they can clip through, and I do understand that complicated bugs can take some time - but this is a pretty major bug and it's been roughly 4 years. In that time they could have completely rebuilt the game from scratch.

I understand that the Developer is rather small, and is trying to balance new content with fixing bugs, but frankly when you have a major bug that has been around for 4 years you're doing something wrong.

I'm still going to leave a positive review/recommendation because if you love survival games, this is one of the best ones your gonna find (realism wise) and is great fun with friends + a decent story if you're into that (even on survival mode without story is good, but the commentary added in storymode makes the first experience better imo)

Do you enjoy wandering around for three or four days (in game) searching for the only coconut in the entire Amazon rain forest, while you slowly die of dehydration, despite the fact that it rains every single day and anybody with an ounce of common sense would be able to deal with the situation simply by CUPPING HIS HAND???!!!!

Don't ask me about the story, because I'm only interested in the survival aspect. It wasn't too bad, for the most part. You have to build a shelter to protect your campfire or it goes out in 2 seconds, which drove me crazy, but isn't too far-fetched. Surviving off small animals and grubs works okay (though I assure you, people can eat roasted grubs without going insane). These aspects were better balanced than in some games.

But the water situation is so absolutely stupid, I can't stand it, particularly because I had to listen to him simpering on and on about how thirsty he was, WHILE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN ON HIM. He could have survived by sucking on his own SHIRT.

Yes, you might pick up dangerous microbes from drinking river water in the jungle without boiling it.

No, rain is not going to hurt you. Drink it, you moron.

------------------
EDIT: As I often do, once I get used to the more infuriating aspects of a survival game, I'm changing my review to ""recommended."" But everything I said still stands. Water management is absurd. Not to mention the fact that you pick up leeches from EVERYTHING that makes you dirty, regardless of how far away from the river you might be. (EDIT2: I looked it up. Yes, you can get leeches ANYWHERE in the rainforest. There are varieties of ""land leeches"" that will latch onto you wherever there are damp leaves.) You can also get worms under the skin, which makes me want to hurl every time it happens. This can happen simply from sleeping out in the forest without shelter. For some reason. Ugh. 

Having said that, it's still the best survival game I've played. Keep in mind, I'm only recommending the story mode option in the game that doesn't have predators or tribesmen trying to kill you as you build your camp. I'll probably try that later, but I'm not sure I'll enjoy it. Animal predators are always highly over-exaggerated in games. (In real life, they only hunt when HUNGRY and ignore prey the rest of the time. In other words, a T-Rex or whatever is unlikely to come after you, after it kills half your party. It's full. It will save you for later.) Evil tribesmen... well, it's a bit of a stereotype, but I suppose they could be a serious problem, if you encountered them.",1659929748,1660202370,True,0,0,0.504470944404602051,0,True,False,False

Frankly, I don't care for the story. But the game-play is really well balanced, and doesn't feel grindy.
Playing on permadeath hardest difficulty. failing to survive, learning recipes and coming back with new knowledge on the next run is really the main fun part.

One thing I wish I knew before I started is that sleeping on the ground is a recipe for disaster! (ALWAYS MAKE A PALM-LEAF BED TO SLEEP ON EVEN IF IT'S A QUICK NAP!)


I only wish there was more to the endless mode. Once you have learnt all you need to efficiently survive, you're kind of just done. Nothing is pressing you to prepare further or make use of the buildings, smithing or traps that you can build.
WIsh there were random events that started happening later into the endless mode so that there was something to encourage you to build and prepare. Like floods, droughts, enemy patrols/attacks, anything like that.",1660000034,1660000201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Or that I could craft with large object that do not fit in your backpack. And that you can carry more than 1 large object as indicated by the bottom right corner.
Also the tutorial lies, bird nests are rarely found the ground; they are in treetops. Also grey leaves can be used as kindle, but you have to cut the whole tree.
Died like 6 time of starvation and poison, and getting mauled by a jaguar or tribes men randmoly spawning behind you.

Besides the rough start, you're just OP in everyway besides agility.
Armor negates most bleed damage. Got mauled by jaguar, 1/5th HP left, not a signle scratch.
Ranged weapon OP, get headshots, win.
Eat all shrooms except the one with the net.
Walking meat everywhere. But you need to craft a roof for your campfire.
Crafting sleeping huts take time. The only time you're actually vulnerable.

I went from scared to Iron age in 8 hour of dying and just.. well I googled recipes because I couldn’t figure out how to make a simple spear because of the weird crafting system; and now the gimmick of struggling how to figure things out is gone.

Quick Survival Guide:
~ Horde Rocks and sticks (especially long sticks and big rocks)
~ You can eat almost every mushroom from the ground + snails maggots etc
~dont worry about drinking dirty water most mushrooms can heal parastites
~CRAFT BOW EARLY no seriously one Headshot can kill almost every enemy in the game
~Watch out for the sounds, every danger has some sound cue to warn you
~Craft some armor, it can help you survive big cat attacks and locals trying to kill you

The beginning of the game immediately grabbed my attention as I was able to put in hours without realizing. Just loading into the world and playing without knowing how to do anything made the game a lot of fun.
The inventory and crafting system in this game was a step above anything I've tried. The way the audio blends in with the environment made it that more immersive. One thing I would want to see is a darker night time. 
I am thankful to have found this leech ridden game and to the people who worked on it, since they did such a good job. 

Whoever is interested in this game and they don't know if they should, I highly recommend. If you don't like it, you can always return it within 2 hours.",1659951072,1659951072,True,1,0,0.514925360679626465,0,True,False,False

You have to maintain your mind and body in the jungle: a place that seems hellbent on killing you. It's a challenge to newcomers and veterans alike in the Survival genre, and through pleasantly customise-able difficulty options you can choose just how punishing you want to go.

As for the story? It was fantastic. I was kept guessing at every turn as I unraveled the mystery, and there were multiple times where I gasped out loud. No spoilers, but be prepared to get shocked and get SAD. It's also astounding how much story you can glean from the world around you in all the little details.

The world feels alive in ways that are both beautiful and terrifying. The survival methods make me think back to my own wilderness survival courses. The environment is a delight to look at and explore, though you'll find yourself cursing it often as you get bitten by ants, or stung by a stingray, or mauled by another bloody jaguar. By the way, treat those scratches: infection is a nasty way to go.

All in all, I can't recommend this game enough purely based on the Story mode. I have yet to try out the other campaign or the sandbox survival. I'm excited to do both, though.",1659942683,1659942683,True,1,0,0.514925360679626465,0,True,False,False
