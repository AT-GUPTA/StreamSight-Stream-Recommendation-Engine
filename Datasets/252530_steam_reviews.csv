Developed by MR-Software GbR, this simulation masterpiece puts players in the driver's seat of a virtual bus, tasked with navigating the intricate streets and challenging routes of a dynamic city.

At its best, OMSI 2 shines with its meticulous attention to detail and commitment to authenticity. From the accurate recreation of real-world bus models to the lifelike AI traffic and pedestrian behavior, every aspect of the game is designed to immerse players in the world of public transportation. Whether you're carefully managing your route schedule or troubleshooting mechanical issues on the fly, the game's realism is sure to impress even the most discerning simulation enthusiasts.

However, this realism comes at a cost, as OMSI 2 is plagued by frequent crashes and performance issues, even on high-end hardware. Despite its impressive visual fidelity, the game struggles to maintain a stable frame rate, leading to frustrating interruptions and delays during gameplay. For players looking for a smooth and seamless experience, these technical issues can quickly become a source of frustration and disappointment.

Furthermore, while OMSI 2 offers a vast open-world environment and a variety of routes to explore, the game's lack of optimization and optimization options can make navigating the city feel like a slog at times. From long loading times to cumbersome menu interfaces, the game's user experience leaves much to be desired, detracting from the overall enjoyment of the simulation.

In conclusion, OMSI 2 offers a realistic and immersive bus simulation experience that's sure to appeal to fans of the genre, but its frequent crashes and performance issues detract from the overall enjoyment of the game. While its attention to detail and commitment to authenticity are commendable, the game's technical shortcomings make it difficult to recommend wholeheartedly. For players willing to overlook these frustrations in favor of a truly immersive simulation experience, OMSI 2 may still offer some enjoyment, but for others, the frustrations may outweigh the realism.

Even with no DLC additions I have found that there is quite a lot that can be done, and whilst the performance is hit and miss, with some tweaking in the settings, the problems can be rectified for a slightly smoother experience.

Though I will add, after some time, the game does seem to lose my interest, the psychology behind this game makes it so that you buy more and more of it's content, for some that's a no problem, for others, not so much.

What's my rating?  We'll give it a 6.5/10.  Not Great. Not Perfect.

Works with my steering wheel.

Can work out fares or disable it so that money isnt an issue, lots of settings to change your gameplay, very good.

Could do with a decent route map as well as the satnav indication, as I have got lost off route and can't find my way back. Also found some graphics changes during the game cause tearing, such as turning on the lights, I'll try different settings but this shouldnt be a problem after all this time.

Â· First of all, this game has the worst optimization you can ever see on the planet. I'm not exaggerating, you can give it a try if you want.

Â· But at the same time, this game has the best physics among other bus-sim games.

Â· You can find a lot of freeware maps, buses etc. on the internet.

Â· The game and its DLC's are VASTLY overpriced. If you decide to buy the game, you will have to buy some DLC's eventually.

Â· Since it's an ABANDONED game, don't expect updates.

Â· Because it's abandoned, this game is forced to run 32-bit. And since the developers (2 students) are decided to not to make this game open-source, NOBODY WILL BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THE GAME. These stupid developers wanted to keep the game for themselves.

Â· The graphics are nothing more than what you see in the trailer. You can download SweetFX mod to improve the graphics just a little bit.

Â· There are some features that should be included in the base game, but published as payware DLC's. (See OMSI 2 Tools - AUXI Expansion.)

Â· Although it came out in 2013, you should install the game on an SSD instead of an HDD.

Omsi 2 is[b] the[/b] bus simulator. It is still the most realistic and accurate simulator out there. The sounds are exceptional and the Busses are historically accurate. 
But the true advantage of Omsi is the community. There are so many custom maps and Busses, it never gets boring. The community truly is the driving factor behind this game and keeps it from dying out.
The main disadvantage is the age of the game. In order to properly play it, you really have to understand how the game works and what it's doing under the hood. Basic or advanced computer skills are basically necessary to mod the game to your liking, but almost all mods have instructions attached.

With addons or not there's a lot to explore on this game and to this day is still alive. It also runs really well on my run-down low-end device which never happens on any other steam game so this is also a positive.

Only downsides are the german errors and the buggy UI system where a few windows hide behind another. Overall this game is worth the money for both addons and the base game itself.

I spent 30 minutes just trying to understand the menus and try out the tutorial (which bugged out). Also, I do not understand why games do not use a generic, vaguely sensible control scheme for recognised peripherals such as game pads. 
I find it truly pathetic when a company releases paid dlc over, and over again for a game, but does absolutely nothing to bring the rest of the game to at least 2010 ui and accessibility standards which would perhaps allow them to justify adding to the almost Â£1,000 dlc you can get for this game.

Spent that long just trying to get playing with a controller to work as the store page itself says its compatible, what I didn't realise is that meant it would recognise there was a controller connected, not that it would be unplayable.

Settings menu for controllers is absolutely atrocious, there is no ability to adjust input sensitivity or deadzones, so when you do use the the controller to steer its maximum input or no input, and if your controller isn't in perfect condition and sits slightly off (this is why deadzone configuration is needed) then that input will ruin any form of steering. 

No one should have to spend an hour or more in a settings menu to setup a controller, and then find out you need 3rd party software to deal with the flaws of OMSI to fix it, only to find that software itself doesn't work, and its solution, to emulate a mouse to use the joystick, and subequently disabling the triggers on the controllers, is frankly unacceptable.

Old Review:

This game has been out over 8 Years now, but i cantÂ´t get enough. Its one of the best Simulators out there and its worth it. Yes, 30â¬ is a lot, but you have to consider that this game is made by one person, the dlcÂ´s by companies. The game is well thought out and you can have a lot of fun even without the dlcÂ´s. A rather bigger problem is the bad coding, and you need a beefy pc to run it at maximum settings. The AI is a bit stupid and has caused a crash or two, but it is okay and you get a better experience. If you want gameplay or story you are at the wrong place. This game is by far one of the best simulators out there...
Well, if you have 30â¬ to spare, go for it!
I would also reccomend the DLCs from Darius Bode! 
And, if you have a Steering Wheel, go for it! Its perfectly optimised for Steering Wheels!

â­â­â­â­â­

OMSI 2 is much more than just a computer game to me. As someone who has always been fascinated by public transportation and enjoys driving, OMSI 2 has brought my passion for traffic and simulation to life.

The adaptability of OMSI 2 is one of its highlights. With a plethora of mods and customization options, you can tailor the gaming experience to your exact preferences. For instance, I replaced the default buses with Doppelgelenkbus DLC buses and added my own regional skins, giving a personal touch to the virtual world.

The Bus Company Simulator DLC adds a whole new dimension to the game. It allows you to run your own bus company, manage finances, purchase buses, and even collaborate with other players. This DLC is an absolute must-have and significantly enriches the gaming experience.

The game presents some challenges, especially for beginners, but with the right tutorials, you can quickly find your way around. I also recommend using a gaming steering wheel as it greatly enhances control.

If, like me, you are fascinated by public transportation and bus driving, OMSI 2 is a fantastic choice. It has brought my passion to life and offers countless opportunities to customize the game to your own style. This is more than just a computer game; it's a journey into the world of public transportation.

Thanks to OMSI 2 and the Bus Company Simulator DLC for this amazing simulation experience!

I only play this game due to the community, external mods, and the driving. Apart from that, it's in need of a serious performance update. Similar, newer games have better prices / very close to.

In short, it's a great game, just in need of an update.

It seems to have been localized for multi-lingual Germans who want to be made to read English for no reason, and that's the least of the game's issues. I can only assume that the game's positive user rating is from players who have been with the game for a decade, as I struggle to imagine the type of person who would be confronted with this absolute mess when wholly unfamiliar and choose to dedicate their two hour refund window to figuring out how to remap the controls to their computer (a type of machine on which the developers apparently never considered anyone might try to run their game.) I don't think I can even describe the default controls, but suffice it to say there are dozens, and they're all mapped to the same two or three keys on the board. 
  It's clear that this game has its own small and dedicated following, but I can't feel badly about leaving a negative review. For one thing, even those passionate few who have gotten past the initial shock seem to have serious performance issues with this ancient title. No doubt this game and its fanbase are victims of the abandonware culture created by game developers and publishers in the age of digital retail. But also, I consider this review to be for the normals, as far as that term can be applied to simulator players. Turn back.

Purchased during a summer sale for around Â£30, the game showed its age with limitations and technical issues. Navigating the interface proved challenging, and the complex tutorials didn't provide adequate guidance. The driving experience in the London add-on was enjoyable but temperamental, with frequent crashes. The AI traffic behaviour was frustrating, and narrow roads added to the challenge. Passengers' complaints seemed unjustified, lacking clarity. OmniNavigation, available at an extra cost, felt almost necessary for a better experience.

Managed to put about 20 hours into it before buying the steam version a few years back but my god is this awful. Not because its hard and I suck at it, it really is the best and most true to life bus simulator out there, but because the game is optimised so poorly it barely runs. Textures sometimes decide to not appear, busses sometimes decide to just stop working and for a game made with the use of a sim wheel in mind it makes it so painful to set up, the menus suck to scroll through and the game runs super duper slow no matter your specs or SSD/HDD speeds.

Its really really good when it works, once you've finished pissing about with slow and unintuitive menus, got passed the common texture glitch and game breaking bugs that is. It's such a shame that the devs haven't decided to optimise the game a bit better, considering they still are supporting the game as they've just released new DLC for it, it would make this game truly perfect. 

Its got an incredible library of player made mods, its super realistic and for a game this old it doesn't look awful, but for the price of the base game and how extortionately priced each map DLC is I simply can not recommend anyone buys this game unless they have hours on end to tinker with it.

2. This game is by far the Minecraft of driving simulation.

So I found out that you can actually change the FOV in a really annoying way, but it does work and MY GOD I drive SOO much better when I can actually see what I'm doing (seeing both mirrors in one view) instead of being locked into tunnel vision. There's a guide on how to do this, its fairly simple, but just annoying, because its for separate for each bus and it certainly doesn't excuse the devs from adding it propperly.
Perfromance is also something you should take into your own hands. Downloading the 4GB patch should help with this. Even with it though I'll warn you, it's quite bad.

All that said, it is actually a really good bus sim, probably the best you're gonna find. However its definetly not for everyone as its a raw simulator, no arcade elements, no simplification, just a realistic simualtion.",1610360272,1677656082,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Other games have tried to steal OMSI2's crown but to no avail. You see, with any vehicle simulator you need good physics. With this simulator it is easy to feel the weight of the bus, so braking is easy to get thye timing down. Also, with an extremely niche category like buses, modability is a must. OMSI has a great selection of mods, which is where all other bus sims fell short.

The game also has some quite advanced gameplay, because, well this is a simulator first, game second. However, due to this, there is not much eye-candy, (that being said, this game does get the realism feel down quite well because of many real-life textures. other bus sims feel like a unity asset flip, apart from The Bus, which unfortunately wasn't quite the OMSI replacement many were expecting...)",1611448264,1674887923,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Compared to other simulators, for example Euro Truck Simulator 2, OMSI2 has a more detailed controls. I do not want to introduce too much here in the comment. Anyway that's one of the reason for which the game is a little bit hard to begin with. But there's a manual!!

252530,67309521,76561198274949686,0,3,29626,0,563,1705868044,"The simulation is highly realistic: you drive a realistic bus, on a real map with actual streets, on actual lines with real timetables (it is actually quite hard to stay on time). Complex crossings and traffic lights are much as on the location simulated. Many locations are highly recognizable (buildings, bus stops, train, subway, and tram stations and stops, road signs, street and sidewalk equipment); you can set the simulated weather to somewhat match the actual weather at the place simulated. All this is mostly enjoyable if you actually know the location simulated (many DLCs can be bought additionally).
The buses are fairly detailed: you set the destination displayed, you set the lights (inner and outer), the heating/AC; the dashboards and additional computers are detailed and mostly functional. The sounds are quite realistic (e.g. for the Berlin buses of the late 1980'es). You let the passengers in and out; the passengers move in the bus (even to the upper deck in a double-decker); you can let the passengers pay the fare. On some lines you can get the automatic announcements for the stops.
You need a steering wheel with wide rotation (900 degrees or more to left and right). Playing with a steering wheel with narrow rotation (90 degrees to left and right), with the mouse, or with the keyboard is doable but not that enjoyable.
Normally you have only one screen, and the view goes only to the front (including the rear mirrors that fit into the view); you can move the camera but this is not as natural as turning your head in real life. There are some glitches and failures. There can be some lagging in dense areas (many buildings or much traffic), depending on the power of the computer. Some buses are braking too steeply. In some rare locations the cars or the pedestrians move weirdly. Still enjoyable.
Today most of the development goes to the DLCs. There are still some minor updates to OMSI2 proper; when such an update installs, it may reset the global configuration (discarding what I tuned for performance (e-g limit on the size of textures), which in turn may prevent OMSI2 from starting), or reset the lists of vehicles (ailists, parklist) or of characters (drivers, humans) in which I had added vehicles or characters from specific DLCs; the best solution is to keep separate backups of these files.",1586884665,1670011102,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

so, just last week i decided to have a look at omsi 2 again since it was on sale and i decided to take the plunge. well, so far, i'm so glad i did. it's an old title so you can't expect modern graphics and great performance but i've had very few problems at all. it runs satisfactory although there's a bit of lag now and again as it loads a new part of the map. so far when i've been driving i've had no problems and enjoyed the experience very much. so much that i've already purchased the london and yorkshire dlcs while the sale was still on.

It looked kinda realistic and the sounds and physics seemed amazing. And I thought, never mind the lag here and there, how bad can it be? Decided to buy the game and a few DLC in sale but now after 15 hours, I regret my decision. Iâll tell you what made me give up.

- The lag is more than you can bear whatever your pc specs are.
- The controls are terrible. The throttle and brake pedals of my G920 donât work in the game, only the steering and buttons work. Itâs a common issue. The only workaround I found was to use the throttle/brake combined and thatâs a pain in the ass. This has never happened in another game before.
- Although you can play with a wheel or controller, you can not bind controls to d-pad keys. The game doesnât recognize them. 
- I know itâs a fairly old game but the graphics and models are horrible. The people sitting on the bus are like chunks of wood.
- You canât add virtual mirrors, canât adjust the seat position, and there is no navigation aid. (OK these were added in a late DLC but itâs said to have problems)
- Choosing a bus and setting up a route is awkward. The menu is confusing and I spent hours trying to understand the logic until I quit and looked for tutorials.
- Sometimes when I loaded a save game, the route that I set up my bus for would be gone/deleted. I would be left in the middle of a route with no objective. Guess what, start again...
- The DLCs are overpriced (almost as much as the game sometimes)

I really wanted to enjoy this game but I got sick of it eventually and uninstalled it. ETS 2 was released earlier than OMSI 2 and look how far it has gone. Unfortunately, I can not recommend this game. I suggest you check out âThe Busâ instead. Itâs in EA and not as simulation as OMSI but at least playable.

It's a decent bus simulator for people who are enthusiastic about buses. Nothing wrong with the style of this game but there is something truly 'not-normal' about the communities you join. Omsi 2 is a already broken game so don't expect to get screaming 100fps in 4k or 1080p but the DLC's that developers release are sometimes dogcrap and sometimes good. I mean you can see the effort developers put into their DLC's just so that people will suck off buying the Â£13.50 mark for one bus which has only got resized about 10 times and called it a 'pack' 

Gameplay Omsi 2 is good but broken at the time. Don't expect your notebook to handle some DLC's cause some DLC's love adding so much detail... it crashes the entirety of Omsi 2..

Yeah sure, the graphics aren't fantastic and there can be quite a few bugs, but the overall gameplay, feel and simulation is really something that can be enjoyed, and in my opinion, an absolute must for all simulation fans / bus enthusiasts. In my opinion it is the best bus simulator available to purchase.

While much of the content is German and from other countries, there is quite a lot of British content available - 100% free! This includes maps, buses, repaints, and even scenery objects if you wish to create your own map.

Other simulators lack features what OMSI has.

But, OMSI has it's own problems. The main one being the fact that the game engine is so old. The game is very unstable at times and crashes a lot. It can cause a lot of frustration.
And it doesn't matter if you have a high-end PC: OMSI still might not run well on it.

But in terms of good graphics it kind of feels a bit outdated considering the game came out in 2013.

I did have some issues at first getting my wheel setup and working properly and setting a bunch of toggles and switches for my custom made and universal button box to make it easier for me, but after a bit of playing around through the menu's and settings I was able to get the hang of things. There is also a manual included for this game, which does really help out as well.

The included map when you first buy the game, is pretty good, although I did run into some performance problems but was able to fix a lot of things through the options and such. I have to say though, so far the game is quite enjoyable after learning it and knowing how to do things as this seems a lot more realistic than any other bus simulator I tried. I strongly recommend using an actual steering wheel controller for this game as I tried an xbox controller as well as keyboard, both are manageable but without an actual wheel, it just doesn't feel right. Overall, if your willing to spend the time to set the game up and learn its functions and how to set everything up, I think its worth giving a fair try.

Pros

All the buses that come with the game are authentically simulated.
The Berlin-Spandau map is well detailed and has a selection of routes.
You can make your own maps if you can get your head round the editor.
The physics for the game are very enjoyable and satisfying to drive.
Lots of buses from 80s-90s Berlin are included with the game.
There is a large selection of freeware and payware buses, maps, repaints and mods from around the world avaliable to download.
The game has a unique, indie charm to it which not many other simulators seem to have.
There are lots of dedicated 3rd party devs making quality content for the game.

Cons

Not the best texture quality.
Has lag.
Bad tutorial.
Many DLCs are overpriced 
And ""Wait for program to respond""

I have got to say, the game picks up what it left behind with the loading screen with the game play. I spent a bit of money on dlcs to try them out.

- Tram dlc thing
- OSMI Navigation
- and a couple others which I forgot the names of

OMSI Navigation is a addon which I think should be in base game. Having to pay like $20 something AUD for a nav system is a bit bs, but I did it anyway. To be fair, its worth getting, as it shows you the way to go.

PC
- Potato
- School Computer
- Gannys Laptop from 2013
- Midrange  <---
- High End
- Don't care about price just need a 3090 + threadripper 3990x
- Ask nasa for a spare computer

Traffic/how is it to drive

Their is heavy scumbag traffic. They are like my dog. They always find a way to get in the way. If you want to pay $15 AUD you can also get the Luxury car package but why would you load more scumbag traffic???

AI People/Paying on the bus

Well, the ai is sometimes glichy, sometimes rude and sometimes you don't know wtf they are doing. Their is a lot of german speech which the ai sometimes says like ""guten tag"" which if your not german like me, means good day/hello. Paying on the busses vaires from bus to bus. Some older busses require you to push out money and select a ticket which is fun, if you know what you are doing. The newer busses just use touch and go

Price

A bit steep, the busses couldn't drive up it.

Should you get it?

Yes, if you have a steering wheel that is. Playing with keyboard is a bit like paying $170 for MFS 2020 THEN WAITING LIKE 3 DAYS FOR IT TO UPDATE AND THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY AT ALL!

OMSI 2 is really quite an interesting and unique game. It is (as it says on the tin) a bus simulator. It does however, have it's pros and cons, which are what I'll mainly be covering in this review.

[b]Pros[/b]
[*] All the buses that come with the game are authentically simulated.
[*] The Berlin-Spandau map is well detailed and has a selection of routes.
[*] You can make your own maps if you can get your head round the editor.
[*] The physics for the game are very enjoyable and satisfying to drive.
[*] Lots of buses from 80s-90s Berlin are included with the game.
[*] There is a large selection of freeware and payware buses, maps, repaints and mods from around the world avaliable to download.
[*] The game has a unique, indie charm to it which not many other simulators seem to have.
[*] There are lots of dedicated 3rd party devs making quality content for the game.

[b]Cons[/b]
[*] The graphics engine is OLD. Don't expect AAA style graphics as it ain't happening from a 10 year old game.
[*] The GUI is dated and some of it is in German, so it can be confusing for new players
[*] Optimization is poor, with lag spikes and long loading times often occurring.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
I would recommend this game as it is unique and provides the best bus simulator on the market. You can tell the devs have put lots of effort into making the buses and map feel true to life and authentic and the selection of adddons available is impressive as well. Overall, I'd have to recommend this even with it's dated graphics and temperamental optimization.

I'd give this game a 7/10.",1638613813,1638613813,True,40,1,0.760416150093078613,0,True,False,False

As a bus lover this is a very good game as it is very realistic and challenging.
You need to sell tickets, you have to beware of running over pedestrians,
colliding with cars and braking very hardly.

----GAMEPLAY----

AI - Good, but walks through the ground sometimes.
Driving - Hard controls when first played, recommended to check key bindings or to change them.\
AI Vehicles - Does not care if vehicle is nearly going to collide, just ignores and collides inside the bus.
Buses - Good graphics, good interior, good exterior, realistic driving performance,  buses do hop like a rabbit sometimes, unless thats just me but yes they keep bouncing unless handbrake is applied, will still bounce though but not too bad. (I mean that is only with me I hope.)
Reminder - If you activate ticket selling, press the keys. ""SHIFT+T, after that T, and then CTRL+T"" just an easier method while ticket selling.
Engine Start up : To start up the bus take your steering wheel off by clicking the bottom of the steering wheel, then you'll see more buttons, click and drag the flippity floppy thing and drag it to the right, you will hear a sound like ""dee de doot doot duuet"" after you hear the sound, there are 2 black buttons, one of those is to start the engine or to turn off the engines, which one is it? I dont know just try either one. For headlights you drag the flippity floppy all the way to the right.
To set weather or timing, click the white arrow at the bottom right to open a tiny menu, you can set weather and timing, and now the important part is to set your destination, to  do that you open the tiny menu and click the paper one, and you're all set.

However on this occasion I've stuck with it and now starting to get a return on my time and money investment. It has to be said the base game is now quite old and not really worth the full asking price, so probably worth waiting for a sale. The default game only comes with two maps, one of which is a small tutorial route and a handful of German buses. It can be tricky to get running, worth switching off multi core capability and finding/downloading what is known as the 4Gb patch. The tutorials are pretty worthless and the best way to learn the basics is spend half an hour looking at many of the introductory video clips on YouTube. 

Forget about trying to control this with a gamepad as you cannot set sensitivity, the bus just swings wildly with a slight twitch on the analogue stick. Keyboard is a bit clunky so much to my surprise I actually found myself using the mouse to control the buses. What you see is all you will get with OMSI 2 as the developers are no longer actively supporting or patching/enhancing the game.

What makes OMSI 2 so good, is that it has essentially become a platform for user created content, both DLC and freeware which far surpasses the original content. For the UK we have the superb Yorkshire Counties and London DLC. In terms of depth and simulation OMSI 2 with DLC far surpasses the TML type bus sims such as Fernbus.

So get it in a sale, buy some of the more recent DLC and enjoy.",1638122726,1638122726,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not easy, I still spend ages setting up my bus, errors on the destination or route and no passengers.. but it's a great driving sim.

I have Track IR, and I have my wheel POV switch working in Omsi 2. Track IR I have a sneaky tip for this, Ill share with you, and hopefully useful. 
I use ""Universal Control Remapper"" and ""VJoy"" to get my T300 wheel POV hat working, just map ""button to button"" and assign POV left right up down to a new profile in UCR with an output ""button to button Vjoy 1"". I named mine Omsi2PoV . 
Doesn't make sense?? 
If you open UCR and Vjoy you'll see the options in the software. Make sure Vjoy and UCR are running before Omsi2, you'll need to enable the profile you created above in UCR everytime you wish to use it. 
Vjoy runs in the background and starts with windows. Vjoy allows a new controller device under Windows controllers, and appears next to your wheel/ game pad. 
In Omsi 2 options, select game controller, go make a coffee, it hasn't crashed but takes an eternity to load your wheel. My fast pc takes several minutes! 
When that page opens, select vjoy device and send it to the right window. Then select the enable box for the the vjoy device, same for your wheel, AND any other devices with buttons you may wish to use. Button box for example. Set Forcefeedback for your wheel, select buttons as normal, then choose Vjoy device, no FFB, but choose actions for the POV hat switch, they work as a rocker. 
I have View external as Up, and tick the continous box, then whatever you want. Cash desk view not so good on the PoV as you have to keep it pressed, I map cash desk to a normal button. On the POV views are good, just tick continous box and hold to view. Tutorials on youtube using UCR and Vjoy for racing pedals as flight rudder for MS Flight Sim 2020- I used with success and adapted to Omsi pov hat as extra buttons. If you get stuck ..wolf6567 on steam, I'll help you get it figured. 

Another tip from me, Track IR 5 is great with this, but a pain in the ass when using the ticket machine, it wonât keep still when selling tickets, so in Track IR software, find the camera tab, youll see the option to centre view, scroll this down find the pause key binding that everyone seems to miss, map this to a key on your wheel. 
Now in Omsi I enable Track IR by pressing ALT, and leave it on. When I stop at the bus stop, I use the pause Track IR wheel button, select the wheel button cash desk view, finish ticket sales, wheel button external camera to check, close the doors with more wheel buttons, driver view button , then final TRACK IR enable wheel button, and indicate, handbrake off and drive away. 
The ability to pause TRACK IR is not in Omsi 2 that I can find, just use the TRACK IR software to bind under camera tab. 
Creating a Track IR profile for Bus Sim helps, just make a new profile, save as Bus Sim, and make it into a steep sided ""V"" , then flatten the sides down as you prefer, or you'll look too far left and too fast. I disable roll, and use a small pitch, and larger Yaw. I set my head where I wanted to look to, then pulled the points on the profile in Track IR to get about 50 degrees, selected smooth. Tried in game, and you can keep fiddling with Track IR by Alt-Tab, no need to quit Omsi everytime.
 I then copied this profile, renamed to TrainSim, Truck Sim etc. Flight sim, I need to look up and down more than 10 degrees, and look further back over my shoulders.

Be warned, I had to play with the graphics a lot to get it running sweet, yes Omsi 2 is OLD, badly optimised, clunky, and doesn't give great performance on my fast pc. Omsi 2 is processor heavy, almost ignoring my graphics card it seems. You MUST find and run a Large Address Aware patch, AND a 4 GB patch on the Omsi.exe in the game folder, every time the game is updated. Just search for them, they work on most 32 bit applications to make them behave with Win10X64- pretty essential. And run compatibility for Win7.   This will make the game more stable, in graphics settings from the launcher, set your RAM.. mines at 8012 mb as I have 8Gb VRAM. The rest of the settings I would strongly advise some homework on youtube- or you'll tank out at 10 fps! I am usually around 30 fps to 35 fps. That's good enough.
With all that, I still get the odd slow down, and the odd small pause as I load map tiles, but Omsi 2 as a bus Sim stands alone in what it CAN do. Realistic maps, check out London for example, realistic buses and driving, it's an amazing bus SIM. Turn on heating or the passengers complain and the window steams up. Push all the buttons, or most of them, in the bus.
If you are an enthusiast, willing to put a bit of effort in to this, then go buy it, grab some DLCs or some of the loads of free community content.  After Bus Sim 18, Fernbus, the amazing ATS and ETS2, and Train Simulator 2021/ TSW2 I have now become a bit of an enthusiast of Omsi 2.
Omsi 2 maybe a bit clunky, but is awesome.  Recommended.",1633704213,1636717583,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is some expectation management to be done, as the game is old and not optimised to take advantage of the latest specifications. At the start, it was the game I had been waiting for, I even had it running on an old Macbook Pro in bootcamp and it ran pretty smoothly. 

You will not have stunning graphics or realistic people, as the screenshots show, but you have excellent physics and sounds which will transport you into the world of being a bus driver.  

These days you need to run the 4G patch with each update and play with the settings to really get it to work properly.

The developers of this game have missed a huge opportunity to improve and upgrade the route.

Good add-ons are:
Hamburg 
London
Berlin X10
Aachen
Yorkshire Counties

Honestly, I played OMSI 1 for the first time in 2012. And yes, it helped me to learn to drive the bus and get driver licence for buses in the reality. But it was in 2012. The OMSI 2 is from 2013 and is the same as the OMSI 1. We are now in 2021 and haven't seen any improvements since 2012.
This simulator is like program from Windows98.
There is problem with everything. Graphics, settings, and even game loading can just crash the game.
I've spend 10 hours to give it a chance, but no. It is not possible to play normally.
In my opinion all positive opinions are because of some kind of fandom.

The game is good, it's a pity that there is no optimization, and it does not support the Russian language. The problem is the fact that sometimes you have to select your own graphic settings for each bus, since the buses in the game will jump on the road, which is very annoying, and the add-ons sometimes do not support systems in Russian.
FR
Le jeu est bon, c'est dommage qu'il n'y ait pas d'optimisation, et il ne supporte pas la langue russe. Le problÃ¨me est le fait que vous devez parfois sÃ©lectionner vos propres paramÃ¨tres graphiques pour chaque bus, car les bus du jeu sauteront sur la route, ce qui est trÃ¨s ennuyeux, et les modules complÃ©mentaires ne prennent parfois pas en charge les systÃ¨mes en russe.

Das Spiel ist gut, schade, dass es keine Optimierung gibt und die russische Sprache nicht unterstÃ¼tzt.

If you want a stable map, with tons of traffic and pedestrians and other busses, Spandau (the standard map) is the most stable one.

But if you like driving in Hamburg, it definetely requires you to find some good settings, which involve into turning down bus-traffic to about 30 busses and AI-cars to about 50 for me personally.

So over the time, I started to like the game more and more, i've had it for multiple years by now and i'm at the stage where I dare to say, OMSI is playable and its a good simulator, if not the best, for bus driving. Graphics aren't the best but the driving is pretty authentic and on point.

Unfortunately, DLC gets released and even though you would think it's official, they're not always finished or qualitative, nor are they released by official devs or publishers. but personally all the DLC I bought turn out to work by now.

Everything to do with driving buses other than considerations of wages and shift patterns is simulated here, from the practically 100% true to life physics, sound, engine, steering, suspension and gearbox behaviour (only physical damage is not simulated by default, but is present on some third-party addon buses), setting your destination controller and announcement controller (where fitted) to the unique characteristics of each bus, to fare and ticket dealings, to timetables, complaints of late running, it's all here. 

Yes it may not be the most optimized, and some do not like the graphical style, which is more akin to Flight Simulator X, than say Forza Horizon 4, and varies highly depending on the settings your PC can handle, but it is in the realism that OMSI 2 truly shines.  It is hands down (other than it's predecessor) the only bus simulator I have used (and I've tried them all except The Bus) that makes me feel like I'm driving a real live bus (which I have done, albeit not extensively, but even from a passenger's perspective it's spot on).  It's not necessarily easy, but no sim really is, as that's the point - to simulate reality, and like flying a plane (though flying a plane is much, much harder) driving a bus is no walk in the park, you can't simply hop in and expect to be an expert after an hour of driving.  And OMSI 2 makes you feel it, much like say FSX or X-Plane etc do with planes, and Train Simulator (ex. RailWorks) series does with trains. 

So if you came to just mess about in a bus, like you might mess about in a car in Forza Horizon 4, this might not be for you, but if you are a hardcore bus enthusiast, and want to enjoy driving the world's buses (well Europe, USA, UK, Russian and Hong Kong mostly - via third party free and paid addons/DLC) you have come to the right place.  OMSI 2 development is live and well and not shifting to a new platform any time in the foreseeable future - OMSI 2 London addon just recently has been released and I can say is very awesome.

Now I still stick to some of what I have said in the past in that the performance and optimization in this game to some will absolutely suck! To some it may be a minor inconvenience as driving in the most realistic bus simulator game outweighs the horrid performance. They have since introduced a 4gb patch which allows you to use 4gb of RAM from your PC for somewhat better performance. However with the many map mods out there (particularly those based in the United States) it gives you plenty to do for free, or with the purchase of some DLC's. Maps are usually based off real life situations. Three years ago i would of rated this 1 out of 10. Today, I will rate it a 7 out of 10. I recommend this game, if you are into modding versus the base game. 

(2/10/2017) I was going to wait until I had played 50 or 100 hours of im game play but I am not. How is the gameplay overall, it SUCKS!  OVERALL ANYWAYS... There are definitely well....just there are some good points of this game. It is very simulated as far as what a bus driver does before he or she even turns on the bus. Most of the buttons on the dash and around you are push activate buttons, HOWEVER they are in GERMAN. I guess that part makes sense considering the gamemakers theirselves. 

So when someone says they have it in English they aren't 100% correct. There is GERMAN dialect in almost every aspect of this game even if its as small as a button on your dashboard. 

As far as the steering is concerned, unless you have a wheel and you can control the sensitivity then its a challenge to steer  but not impossible. I tried EVERYTHING, my PS4 controller which took me only so far, then the keyboard which was horrible, and the mouse.  Using the mouse to steer and accelerate was not bad. You just select mouse to control drag the cursor up to ACCELERATE, and down to BRAKE. Left to steer, Right to steer pretty simple and halfway decent.

Now this review is based on the fact that I haven't downloaded the DLC for Chicago Downtown which thats the main reason I bought the game, cause after all everything in route is in English. Also a few YOUTUBERS did a great job displaying gameplay for CHICAGO (shoutout to Squirrel).

I am however afraid to download the DLC for Chicago because when I first started downloading and installing this game it right off the bat was giving me troubles. Crashed a few times and some of the tutorial shortcuts didn't work. Even crashed at tutorial 2. For a better tutorial go to YOUTUBE and look up OMSI for Squirrel or OMSI for StudiousGamer.

SO MY FINAL VERDICT, based off of the 8 hours of gameplay would I recommend this game to anyone. NO. I paid $35 and unless I get the Chicago DLC and actually can play it I will feel that this is a complete waste. IF YOU ABSOLUTELY want this game, its $30 on Aerosoft website, $29 with tax on Amazon however with Amazon Digital Download you DO NOT GET A REFUND.",1486783809,1614407307,False,4,0,0.51059877872467041,8,True,False,False

In my opinion, it's the best bus simulator at the moment for the realistic side of things. It has some great maps, buses, and repaints which are all made to a high standard. It really does feel like your driving the real thing when it's working and not crashing! 

However, for a 10+ year old game, it has its issues... It does require some patience when setting it up and to get used to all the controls. I would recommend having a decent PC to run the game well as it does not like framerate at all but if not just lower your settings to fit your PC.

Iâd say about 99% of it was spent trying to learn how to get anything moving. 

The UI, the tutorial... are just abysmal work with and figure out. As usual, these types of games are made by overseas devs. Which isnât so bad, just that things arenât properly, fully nor correctly explained. 

I have to say.. games like this being marketed in territories other than where it originates from need to have some clarity in the way this works, properly in every language in their respective territories. Because Iâve not had such difficulties with a game as Iâve had with this one. 

Iâd say this needs a serious overhaul, something more simplistic, or it needs a new iteration, because this game leaves so much to be desired. 

So far, for me. This is a complete waste of money. I see other players with cool mods, and always wished I could engage with the community more. But every time I try to give this thing a chance. Iâm ALWAYS reminded as to why Iâve stayed away from.

My first review of OMSI was very negative but something compelled me to keep playing it! The game sucks you into it's magical and crazy world of ultra-realism and it can be quite addictive. The graphics are outdated, the game is full of bugs and there is little to no tutorial. 

Once you spend hours learning how to play the game and start to understand how it works, it quickly becomes one of the best Bus Simulators on the market, despite the fact it is an old game. The graphics are certainly outdated to say the least but it somehow still manages to feel ultra-realistic. Other more recent similar games such as Fernbus and the Bus Simulator 20** series aren't bad games, but they fail in comparison to what OMSI can offer for a true bus enthusiast.

You start off with one outdated map of Berlin which comes standard with the game and it is good learning curve. I would suggest you start off with this and watch / read tutorials online to learn a basic understanding of the game. It certainly takes some time and can be quite frustrating but is worth putting in the effort.

Once you know the basics, you can then move onto downloading extra content on Steam, which is very easy! Alternatively, you can download other DLC from different sites if you can install them yourself as it is often more complex and requires quite good technical knowledge. I would suggest starting off with the Hamburg or Berlin X10 Maps on Steam as both the Cities are very well modelled and the buses that come with these packs are excellent.

It is when playing the Add-on maps that the game really comes into it's own. As long as you know the basics of how the game works, which isn't that complex once you get used to it, setting up a route and driving is very straight forward. The buses feel and sound so realistic and having been on the same buses in real life I really can tell how much time and effort has gone into these faithful recreations. The cities such as Berlin and Hamburg are so detailed and you will see the same shops and scenery as you would driving the route in real life. After you are familiar with a route, you can go on Youtube and watch the route in real life and you will be shocked that you know every turn and detail along the route, even though you may not have been in person.

Driving on the game is good. Ok it's not perfect and the AI cars do stupid things but it certainly conveys to you the challenge of driving a big vehicle through tight and congested city streets or on the open road. Different buses really do feel very different to drive and the amount of power to get the vehicle moving and up to speed is conveyed very well!

Overall, I would highly recommend the game. It is far from perfect and outdated but it is still a lot of fun and really does it's job of a 'bus simulator' extremely well. Go through the frustrating first hours of learning the game and have hours of fun. 

On a side note.... You will often find the game quite 'laggy' at first on the more complex maps. It is worth mentioning the OMSI is not particular well optimized and does need quite a powerful PC to play it. I would say at least I5 and a decent graphics card. Even on a decent PC, it is common to have issues at first but you can tweak the settings yourself to resolve these problems. With a bit of patience and advice from YouTube you can easily change things in the menu and have it running very well. OMSI is a game that rewards you for putting in the time and effort and is not something you can just jump into but if you 'get it' you will love it.",1604321099,1605308884,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am always to say this game probably has the most in depth simulation of a bus, full system operations, ticket selling in accordance with actual ticket printers, and very user unfriendly bus dashboards. 

This is what driving a bus really is, not that Aerosoft/TML/Astragon derivative stuff. This is the realest of deals you can get.

Bendy, Single Deck and Double Deck as standard, but the add-ons? Hybrids, Electrics, Licensed Volvos and Scanias, RHDs, and that is all just what has been released so far.

The modding community adds a depth to this game that is almost unparalleled. The maps that are made are for the most part of excellent quality, and clearly made by people with passion.

That all being said, there are some clear downsides. The game requires a patch that needs to be constantly reapplied after every update to run to its full ability. Some mod creaters who make maps for money, are more about quantity than quality, and you are almost always fearful when you see certain creators making releases.

Sure, it is hit and miss, and sure, there could be more beta testers and ability for steam to allow feedback into certain mods to trigger a quality review. But buy and large, for most of the maps and busses you can get in addition to the base game, this community is massive.

Thus far, these are my favourite mods
Maps - Yorskire 2.0, Berlin BRT, Hamburg Modern
Buses - Hamburg Hybrid (Volvo 7900), any bus from Masterswitch and Studio Polygon, Hamburg Bus Pack (2017 MB C2)
Extras - Ticketer ticket machines from all Masterswitch and Studio Polygon buses

And my least favourite
Maps - Dusseldorf, Bremen-Nord
Buses - Halycon C2 (Berlin BRT), Dusseldorf Solaris",1397948184,1601035941,True,1,0,0.502762436866760254,0,True,False,False

The only reason why I bought this game was for the UK bus mods.  So  this may not be the best review to go off.

The thing that got me most with the game was the amount of lag I was getting when I was driving the bus.  Considering on other simulators I get a smooth game. This game was nowhere near as smooth.  Also when you use the wing mirrors, the views are not smooth, like they are in the truck sim games by SCS.  The other problem was the lack of support for a joypad. Even though it says Full controller support I just couldn't get the right sensitivity on turning.  This was a problem when playing on the laptop. Using mouse and keys is a lot better, which is how I play on my desktop.  As for the sounds. They are actually good.  Especially on the Leyland Fleetline mod.  

There is extra DLC which can be purchased here, So there is extra things you can add. As well as the already mentioned mods you can find.  So there is some choice out there.  You can also make your own maps too.

As I said, this is not the best game I have played, but for the UK bus scene. There really isn't much else out there.",1594899780,1594899780,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No it is not recommended. If you are talking about optimization, I would say that pubg is optimized 10x better than this game. I run a GTX 1080 and an I7-6700K with 16gb of DDR4 2666mhz RAM. This should be able to handle this game without any issue. I avarage 15-20FPS sometimes 40 and the makers have done nothing to help with such problems. Only thing I could say is wait if they make an OMSI 3.

I mean the game keeps running out of memory out of the box, if you want to drive a bus you need to install a mod someone made that allows for 4gb of memory use. The game get's random black screens, crashes a lot and what not. It was kinda good when I bought it years ago, but now it has just become very buggy.

I personally haven't found any bus simulator that has compared to OMSI 2. One of the things that I love about OMSI 2 is the detail, everything is done to a professional scale. The game is pretty buggy, crashes quite abit and the graphics aren't the best but what it has to offer makes me forget about the issues. I also find OMSI 2 to not have an arcade feel like Bus Simulator 18 has. You can also find many mods that will improve your experience playing the game.

Pros:

Very Detailed
Many addons and 3rd party mods (Maps and Vehicles)
Feels professional
Driving is realistic
Great steering wheel support
Track IR support

Cons:

Terrible AI Traffic
Quite abit of crashes
Buggy
Many lag spikes from map loading
Game is very outdated at this point, no 64bit support
General lag even with beast computer

I would strongly reccomend this game if you are a transit buff looking for a great bus simulator.",1537934584,1583190996,True,6,1,0.535177350044250488,0,True,False,False

Omsi 2 is probably the most realistic bus simulator you can find. The physics, textures and features you can find on the busses are the best ones out there. Sadly it isn't being developed anymore since 2016 but the mod community is still very alive, making maps, busses etc. When you first start the game there are a lot of options to set and it's very overwhelming at the beginning since the tutorials aren't very good so you pretty much have to find out how to do stuff yourself but once you get the hang of it, it's amazing and you can't stop driving. I'd recommend downloading some addons since the default busses and maps get boring pretty fast. Free stuff will do the job for the start and there are actually really nice free things you can get if you search around in the forums a little. But beware, the DLC you can buy in the steam store are very expensive so make sure you really need them before buying. Steering wheel is recommended but you can drive fine with a keyboard or mouse as well if you set it up correctly. So because the development was dropped back in 2016, the game is still very unfinished, buggy or laggy at some points. Nothing game braking but it sometimes crashes or stuff like that. It also isn't optimized that well. 

Overall I'd definitely say this is absolutely worth buying.",1579405539,1579405539,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game doesn't even work, it crashes if you click on the the loading screen, crashes if you spawn in a place from the original game (which were added by the devs in to OMSI 2), the optimizations are a disgrace and even in the Steam sale, this isn't worth the Â£13.49 that I paid for this, it isn't even worth Â£5.

I would have loved to have done a real review on this, but as it stands. not possible, with 18 minutes of attempting to actually get in to play the game, which I not once successfully done as it crashed every single time.

Now some will say ""Why didn't you search for fixes?"", I did and you know what I seen?

LOTS and LOTS of people say how the devs are lying about this game and how the original is a lot better, how this game is terribly optimized and runs just as good as dried syrup.

I will be getting my money back on this horrendous excuse of a game.

1. Game time goes as fast as real time
2. You can stop anywhere in a bus stop (just not VERY far), because the passengers will walk to your bus
3. Almost every button in the buses work
4. The game has great DLCs (I think Berlin X10 is the best - it gives you so much routes, many others give you one or two)
5. You can explore the cities without driving like the route
6. There are routes from the bus park and to it in the schedules
7. Game has routes that can only be driven during rush hours
8. If you don't have a steering wheel controller, you can realistically drive using your mouse (some other games allow this too, but the mouse-driving in Omsi is the best
9. You can't lose in this game: you can only toggle the 'police stops you for some time if there is an accident' option. 

And that's only a small amount of features that are in this game...
Also, quick tip: buy Omsi only when it's discounted. And don't forget to download all the free DLCs.",1573901629,1573901629,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Works with Windows 10 perfectly fine
- I wouldn't advise clicking during the loading screen
- You probably require a better CPU that the minimum shown
- The bouncing you get are when you don't have enough CPU power to process the physics, turn down your graphics or press P to pause the game and let the textures load in.
- If you're a fan of UK simulation, there is a great website for UK bus and map mods called Fellowsfilm as well as the DLC UK Buses.
- Mods and maps are easy to install and make the gameplay so much better, some maps like Omsi Airport can be downloaded using an .exe file that auto installs the game for you.

----------

FOR HARDCORE BUS ENTHUSIASTS:
- If you are a hardcore bus enthusiast, in that case, this is the game for you without a doubt. The overall behaviour of buses is realistic, and it takes skill to master driving individual buses, routes, turn on the air conditioning, heating, kneel the bus, use ASR, and so on. Memorizing and mastering these skills with about dozens of buses (I'm refering to fan made buses) is a challenging and interesting experience at the same time, and will keep you behind the wheel for a long time.

REALISTIC BUS SOUNDS:
 -Perhaps you boarded a bus in real life and wonder if it sounds anything like it in the game? Most likely, it does.

EXCELLENT FAN MADE CONTENT:
- This game has a large amount of fan made buses, maps, repaints, sound mods, even the game came out more than 5 years ago (as of writing this).

REALISTIC DRIVING EXPERIENCE:
-Buses behave much like their real life counterparts, physics and sounds make a nice addition, deepening the driving experience.

WINTER:
- You can toggle weather conditions at any given moment ingame. That includes even freezing winter conditions, that (obviously) affects the driving experience, making breaking distances longer, lowering the passenger cabin's temperature, etc.



-------
CONS
-------


AN UNSTABLE GAME:
 - The game tends crash and produce various errors regularly, and if you're not willing to use some of your spare time searching answers from the internet, maybe do a few hotfixes by yourself or you're not a tech wizard type of person, in that case, you'll be spending more time solving issues than playing the game. Even if you did a few hotfixes, it is not a guarantee that your game is fully stable at best.

UNFORGIVING DIFFICULTY FOR NEWCOMERS:
- Omsi 2 has this nasty habit of you expecting know everything in an instant, which means that if you don't play the tutorial or the Tutorial ""breaks"" as it tends to do, you are in for a world of hurt and end up seeking answers to even the most fundamental questions like how to start your bus, open doors, fix various mechanical issues your bus might experience while driving, etc. Not to mention invisible walls and other unexpected crashes you might run into. Crashes and collisions can be disabled, however.

VISUALS / PERFORMANCE:
- The game looks very outdated, buildings, pedestrians, etc. And the game tends to suffer from performance issues. This applies particularly in case of heavily detailed areas where many sceneryobjects are used. In the worst case, low fps will break the physics engine, and cause your vehicle to jump erratically, thus breaking your driving experience, and causing other problems. Also, the optimization leaves a lot to desire, for the reasons above, after all - it is supposed to be a driving simulation game where you need precision and razor sharp focus when you are driving - which is next to impossible when your game starts to resemble a slideshow rather than a smoothly running videogame.

AI DRIVERS:
- AI drivers are very unpredictable, and might crash into you with no reason. If you wonder will an AI car give way; don't bother - 50%+ cases, they won't. AI vehicles often tend to give a signal while driving straight, signalling right, but suddenly turning left. Yeah, you just have to ""know"" these things while driving.

NO MORE PATCHES:
- As of writing this, the game has not been patched in years, leaving many of the previously mentioned issues unsolved.





CONCLUSION:

If you are a bus enthusiast, you are willing to forgive some hickups, you are not bothered by occasional technical problems, and you would like to drive dozens of your favorite buses. Then, this is the game for you.

If you are looking for more accessible and easy-to-approach-technical-issue-free-non-broken-game-experience, then you should look for other products if driving a virtual bus in general is something you seek.

Omsi 2 is a somewhat broken game with a big heart, that can be reached only with patience and true passion for buses.",1572146999,1572146999,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I live in the UK, and have always wanted to find a good UK bus simulator - there are many free UK add-ons available online, and many maps you can get. Only downside is that the game crashes quite a lot, and I've had several BSODs while trying to run it and a web browser at the same time.

Overall - a very realistic bus simulator, with almost everything fictional!

-Very good scenery and routes.
-You can use ALL of the buttons on the busses.
-Easy set up.
-It FEELS good.

Negatives:
-Unfinished roads, you can sometimes litterately drive OFF the road.
-The DLC you can get from the store is very buggy (and bounces a lot, weirdly)
-UI can be confusing.
-Steer sometimes seems reacts very late.

Overall:
Very good game, busses you get with the base game work fine, DLC busses tend to be a lot less polished.
Is good for if you like busses, but it is NOT comparable with games as Euro Truck Simulator 2.
(If planning to buy, think about buying a steering wheel, as it makes the game a lot easier.)

It is a simulation on a very detailed level. You have to program the sign yourself (there are functions in the interface, but I think that is cheating), an onboard computer to be programmed with correct line, bus etc (depend on what year you are simulating, and what version of the bus) and the aircondition almost require a separate manual.

I like this kind of simulations, there you need to wait for the bus to warm up before you can start driving, or use the aircondition to remove fog from the windows. I recommend it, at least during a sale.

- epic customization
- lots of aftermarket (dlc, freeware)
- REAL TIME WEATHER (hello SCS...?)
- REAL DISTANCE/TIME. none of that toy like compression nonsense
- Actual weather rendering with physics based on conditions of road
- POTHOLES.
- actual working air conditioning (yep. thats a big one, SCS)

Im ""lucky"" in that the game is stable for me, and it should be for you if you know how to build and set up a gaming rig properly.  

Sadly the game is abandoned and will not be updated. MR software broke up and the one person still involved with software went on to make LOTUS which is, wait for it, LITERAL COPY OF THE OMSI ENGINE!!!! in 2019. Yes.   You read this correct. Check it out for the luls. 

Anyway, this is still the best bus/truck/actual driving sim game, despite it looking horribly outdated. If you appreciate gaming for it is, you will love this. If you are in for just a single button mindless eyecandy, you will hate this one.

On the other, if you don't know German some things can be very confusing. The tutorial was a pain, I recommend watching videos on YouTube to learn how to play, Squirrel is good YouTuber. There are really only 2 or 3 main bus routes to play back and forward in the base game. You have to buy additional cities for nearly the same price as the base game. The passengers have very little variation and they seem to have been rendered at different resolutions. It gets creepy seeing the same person board the bus every time, sometimes seeing clones of the same person 3 at a time board your bus, but oh they did a palette swap on their T-shirt so it's a different person. Maybe if I was German this game would make more sense to me. I am addicted to driving a bus now. Thanks OMSI. Best way to play this is with a beer in hand (mouse controls) and a contempt for your passengers.

I'm giving this a 10/10 because it keeps count of how many pedestrians you have run over.

Warning: There are stability issues all over. I recommend searching for the 4GB patch (easy to find) once you have installed the game.

This is not a game in the sense that it lacks progression in the form of story, achievements and unlock but that stuff is irrelevant in my opinion. The progression lies in mastering the bus driving, ticket management although that is optional and mastering the routes and timestables.

But ultimately I couldn't get it to work with my wheel -- Fanatec CSL Elite for PS4 (with a Universal Hub for Xbox & PC rim).  And I tried to settle for my Xbox 360 controller that it did recognize, but the calibration seemed so poor and clunky that it was no fun.  I think you really need a wheel.  But for the tiny bit using the keyboard it seemed like I would really like it if it would only work.  But I am getting too close to my 2 hour refund window, so I will request my first ever steam refund :( .

1. My first problem was that I couldn't launch it.  It got stuck on a profile & map selection screen with no apparent way to start the game, because the menu buttons like Start, Tutorial, Options, Quit, etc (at the bottom) were off screen, regardless of running at 1080 or 4K.  That was solved by setting Windows 10 Display Settings for ""change the size of text,..."" from the 150% windows-recommended default to ""125%"" (but note discussion threads recommend 100%).  Then I could launch the tutorial.

2. My next problem was that the tutorial got stuck on an instruction to use ""[SHIFT] + [Z]"", but I later found out is actually ""[SHIFT] + [Y]"".  Plus the tutorial text was small, boring, and hard to follow in a little scroll box.  I had much better luck by watching two 30 minute Youtube tutorials for beginners.  I rushed at first, and didn't know about the parking brake :) .  But ultimately I got the bus to move.  But I gave up on the tutorial and just started a game and followed Youtube tutorials.

3. Ultimately the wheel support for my Fanatec CSL Elite for PS4 (with a Universal Hub for Xbox & PC rim) was recognized as a device, but inputs failed to register any change from the ""48"" level, so no control or calibration possible.  It recognized it in each of it PC, PS4, & Clubsport V2 compatibility modes, but none registered any change from any inputs.  Note, my wheel works fine on other games like Project Cars, Dirt 3, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit just fine, and a windows 10 ""Wheel Tester"" app.  This was a near deal breaker that I can't use my wheel.

4. The Xbox 360 controller setup was recognized, but made for such poor stilted driving, and was difficult to calibrate but I think I got it as ideal as it would get.",1546402624,1546402624,False,2,0,0.521354913711547852,0,True,False,False

Hoiwever, you can see I only spewnt 26 minutes in this game. Thos 26 were spent setting up a profile (2 minutes) then trying to read the tutorials where half the instructions are outside the window. Right-clciking has view source, which shows they are html - so I could read the entire tesxt that way, but the next and prev buttons were off screen apart from a tiny 2-3 pixel bar. I am guessing they were prev/next because they seemed to page through the half visible text. It's html! how hard is it to put some scroll bars (overflow:scroll anyone?)

Finally get into the game, having ignored the tutorials as useless, and I was presented with a view of three busses. I clicked one and it gave a message asking if I wanted to take over control. I selected yes and an alert box in german came up. I dont speak german - that's why I selected the english option.

I was then presented with a window full of options and instructions, some in german. I figured I would click ok and hope the defaults worked.

The screen went blank for a second and then I was presented with a view of the bus with whit texturs everywhere. Still not inside the bus.

Anyway, TLDR: If the devs and QA can't even be bothered to make sure the tutorial text can be read it doesn't bode well. It takes forever to load and when it does half the instructions are in german. I hit the refund before I lost the chance.

If you want to take the risk and give this a try, go ahead. I bought this because it was on sale and the reviews are mostly positive - God only knows why!!

However.

However, when busses are bugged, they're often not fixed. Take the AGG300 for example, the developed mechanics to allow this bus to exist are still WIP since ... 2016. Granted, December 2016, but still, a 2-year development only for a single bug that just crushes your experience is a little bit too much.

And it's precisely the problem. See, this game is starting to be outdated. Bus Simulator 2018 is out, and while it's still far behind in both sound & physics department, it is in advance in user-interface, graphics & passengers-AI. All in all, the lack of intuitivity and development from MR-Software are clearly showing only 3 years out.

It would have been a plus if OMSI, with its very simple map, would have shared equally easy development tools. Then it would have been nearly immortal, if it wasn't for its environment & AI graphics that are plain ugly.

This game is not for casual players. This game is for serious and hardcore players only. And in order to play and enjoy this game you need to meet the following requirements:

1. A monster PC. You may say ""Wait a minute, with the crappy 1980s graphic ? seriously ?"". Yes i am serious, no matter if your 
 PC can run best graphic games at the ultra setting, with OMSI2 you will only get 20-30 fps just at the medium setting by the same PC. Otherwise the graphic will even look crappier. Well, if you insist that you don't care about the eye candy, then move to 2.

2. A lot of patience and time to study and research on Google or Youtube, now you may say ""wait a minute, this isn't a flight simulator, how complicated it can be ?"". Believe me, some flight simulators are easier than OMSI2. It will take you at least one hour just to start the engine of a German bus and set the route schedule, mostly because the functions are in German and you need to do about 20 - 30 steps in order to start the engine and set the route. So, reserach ? Oh i forgot to mention that each bus is totally different from each other, so when you switch to another bus, you have to learn from zero. 

3. More patience, now you may say ""what could be worse ?"". Well, the German are renowned for their heavy industry, like producing best cars in the world such as Mercedez and BMW, but they suck real bad in software programing. I have never seen a good german software, and OMSI2 is a very fine example of that. After you have spent hours managing to start the engine and set the route, now you finally get to drive the thing, but then after 20 minutes, suddenly your bus is floating in the sky for no reason, everything around you is white, you can't see shit. -- Restart the game -- just to find out that it is a permanent bug ... along with even more major bugs .... - - Quit the game --- and move to Fernbus or ETS2.",1536056905,1536056905,False,11,3,0.528156161308288574,0,True,False,False

+ Incredibly detailed buses, even more in DLCs, mod buses are usually quite good as well
+ Detailed maps, not a whole lot of variety with base game but DLCs and mod maps definitely help
+ Sounds are amazing
~ UI can be daunting for new users but once you figure it out, it's easy
~ On certain maps, even if you're following the directional arrows very carefully and go down the road you're supposed to it's still easy to go the wrong way
- Has [b][i]way too many[/i][/b] texture issues (buses and buildings going white) and crashes for what you pay
- Most DLC is rather expensive and doesn't go on sale often

Lets start with the biggest Point. Don't expect geat graphics. I find the graphics a little bit to ""cartoonish"". If you have a decent PC, you should get good FPS, and not so much lag on performance.
The game is only supporting a max of 2 GB RAM, but you can solve this issue (sort of) by using the 4GB patch. 

If you are decided to buy OMSI 2, please bear in mind that there is a lot to learn and do. To start with, there are two maps. Start on the map ""Grundorf"" to get to know the simulator. It's very detailed (almost every button functions on the bus), and the physics are pretty accurate aswell.
After you have learnt to drive the bus, sell tickets and you want to de something more challenging, you can go on and drive on the ""Spandau"" map.

With basicly 4 lines to drive, you can see some of the city of berlin. The chronofunction makes it interesting to see how a single busline evolves with the passing of time. There are diffrent busses for the times you are driving.

If you are fed up with Spandau, you can also get some DLC. Some are even free! It gives a nice change. There is also a lot of mods availeble from the internet. maps from different country's, Busses from diffrent muanufratures and all kind of repaints!. This makes the game even more fun!

On the moment of writing this review I have played this game for about 1450 hours, and I still enjoy it. Altough if I had a PC wich was worst, I would have dropped the game very fast.

Pro's:
+ Realistic physics
+ (in most busses) everything is klickable
+ A lot of great DLC and mods availeble from the interweb

Cons:
- Laggy on low-end PC's
- The grapics are not that good
- the game engine is a bit unstable

However, There are a few glitches, Sometimes the Peds don't get on the bus, Also things like getting caught on objects, But overall it's a good game

Pros-
A bustling cityscape with passable graphics.
Buses are fully detailed with every knob and switch littering the cabs being operational and doing...something. (See cons)
Realistic schedules for the player to keep to, although running late has no real effect minus some annoyed passengers.
AI buses run around on their own dedictaed lines, adding to the realism...somewhat. (See cons)
Fully functional ticket and iBus machines which the player is required to set up at the start of each run.
Player is able to sell tickets, collect fares and give change to passengers.

Cons-
The tutorials on how to operate the bus are poor. They will often freeze or are only available in German. (I only knew how to drive by watching YouTube Let's Plays) This means you will be mostly left alone to figure what each of the dozens of controls do on each bus.
There is a disappointingly low amount (4) of drivable routes compared to the vast number that the AI exclusively control.
Both the passenger and traffic AI are primitive and unpredictable. Passengers will take unreasonable amounts of time to walk to and board/alight the vehicle and complain about the slightest of trivial issues. The traffic will almost always cut you off by making sudden turns into other lanes and often cause jams by blocking each other off. AI buses will make literally last second turns into the bus stops and as such will often block roads waiting to enter one that is already occupied rather than queue up behind.
Overpriced and equally poorly designed add ons.

Overall, a decent simulator for those interested in buses, but let down considerably by it's outdated and low quality game engine. (Despite an ""improvement"" in engine quality) A fun game, but only when it and it's DLCs are heavily discounted.",1518276336,1518440942,True,5,1,0.567761719226837158,0,True,False,False

That, it does very well. Unfortunately there are some downsides that do turn people off from the sim heavily:
-Pros:

-Neat system simulation, such as the ALMEX, IBIS, Heating/Cooling systems (windows included), and Kneeling systems (though it seems they're never used in the sim and just there for immersion). 

-More realistic way of operating the bus. Meaning you have to turn on the electricals, and you are encouraged to wait for the engine temp to go up a little before setting off (though I haven't noticed any downside from not). 

-One of the default routes, Spandau, is pretty close to how it is in real life, and on top of that, includes Goes to the nearby town of Falkansee, as it was in the late80s/ early 1990s. Following it on Google Maps Street View, I was amazed at how close it was to real life (give or take about 25 years, as the map progression stops at around 1994.)

-There is a ""Chronoevent system"" which is used in the game, and Spandau route uses very well. Before 1989, you're trapped in by the Berlin Wall, so routes like 92 will finish off shortly before the wall. After 1989, the wall falls, you start to see Trabants (Small East German cars) in town and 92/137 (depending on which route you drive) will go to the  Falkansee Train station.
-Many neat maps and buses for it. The Payware you can get through steam can be pretty nice (in particular Chicago, Berlin X10, and I heard great things about Hamburg), but there are a lot of nice Freeware buses, such as the Solaris Urbino buses, and maps like Project Szczecin. The only downside of the Freeware is, a lot of it is behind sites that are filled with fake download buttons, but if you know your way around, you can easily get it and enjoy it.
-Pretty nice little Freeware DLC of a fictional French town, plus the same dev of those DLCs also released a small collection of VanHool Buses from the late 1970s to the early 2000s, which works alright and has further fixes/etc on his website.

Cons:
-The sim is pretty poorly optimized, being written for 32 bit and seems to no longer be supported much by the dev team, as the two gentlemen who had made it had long gone their seperate ways. Its memory usage out of the box is pretty limited and can cause problems on more complex maps like BerlinX10 and Chicago. Setting up the 4GB patch ends up fixing a lot of those issues, but you still see a lot of optimization issues. Even more power computers have experienced issues on maps like Chicago and X10. When the sim is really struggling, things like Articulated buses will end up jumping around the road like a Lowrider, often making the passengers less than happy. Overall, it is pretty playable, but it might struggle at times compartiviely from time to time. 
 
-DLC (at least on steam) can cost quite a bit, even when on sale, you might find yourself having a rough time justifying the cost. A decent amount of the DLC appears to be reasonably supported with updates every now and then to fix bugs (a lot of it was made by 3rd parties.) Some of the official DLC (i.e. the Download packs) can be pretty expensive for what they are (AI people/cars) and can be a little difficult to install for those with limited technical skills (not too hard, just putting in a few files into place, adding/changing a few lines in a notepad file.) 

-Community outside of Steam is largely and overwhelmingly German Speaking. This can cause issues for those looking for outside help, but using something like google translate helps get through forum discussions, and I do understand that the forums are pretty friendly towards those who speak other langauges and try to help as well.

-The Tutorial is pretty badly written, almost feels like a word for word translation out of Google Translate at times, as it'll pop up with Nonsense. On top of that, it makes a lot of referecnces to the German Keyboard layout which will cause many having a rough time going past them, (Z and Y are swapped, so SHIFT+Z is actually SHIFT+Y, POS1 is ""Home"" etc.)

-AI can be simply idiotic , but that's like, every. Driving. Sim. Ever. 

Aside from these issues, the sim is actually pretty good, I'd recommend buying it when it goes on sale, as the 35 USD pricetag makes it VERY hard to justify the price considering the optimization issues. For some reason, I just find it addciting, almost a race against the clock kind of sim (when you play with a timetable).",1518110272,1518110272,True,26,0,0.742296934127807617,1,True,False,False

After 32 hours, I'm writing this review.  I'm not (was not?) a bus fanatic.  I like fps games in general.  i saw a youtube video (nerd cubed ) quite some time ago and the game looked so ridiculous that I had to try this thing for myself.  I purchased the game and got bored/frustrated after about a half an hour.  There the game sat in my queue.  I picked it up more recently, more determined to get through the hard learning curve.  I still don't know a lot. But I see a lot of folks frustrated with graphics, and I may have some information that helps, so here goes.

The game is hard.  It may take you a half an hour to even start the bus.  It may take you a few attempts to get through the introduction, since the intro sequences will stop you from proceeding even when it's not clear what you button you need to hit (it should at least flash, blink, or tell you explicitly what button or key to push).  You'll have to read the manual for help, but when you put enough hours into the game (10?) you'll have an easier time with this.  You may want to use a bogus driver ""login"" because you'll be terrible at first.  You'll miss stops, you'll be late, especially if you're counting money.  I started with the money, but you can turn this off if you want to focus on the bus driving first before adding things that will cost you time (making you late).  I picked the same bus each time for awhile, because you'll need to figure out stuff that will be harder if you keep changing buses (i.e. you have to try to keep the bus comfortable for people and, if you're not used to Celcius, you will be).

I'd recommend these things for new players, although people's thoughts will vary on this (I did this with money-counting and I had an OK time with that).   AI traffic - the traffic will hit you wildly and you'll have to stop and call in the police (thereby making you late).  I turn that off, and I try to drive properly even though I don't ""need"" to (I can simply drive through cars at this point).  I'd turn the money off to start, or maybe simplify it.   drive through the tutorial in Grundorf (note that you only get the tutorial here) and drive for awhile there, as that's a simple map.  It's still fun.

Graphics -> this thing is a monster and badly needs optimization.  I see lots of people complaining about this, and what i found to be helpful was to scour the add-on DLC manual pages and follow their recommendations (they differ, so compare them and test).  I have a 4790k  i7 intel cpu and GTX 750ti (not the fastest but not awful for games of this era).   I was able to double my framerate by following the steps in some of those manuals.  Right now I set it to 30fps, I lowered the other settings as recommended in the manuals, and I set up filtering via my nvidia graphics card settings for the game.

The game is fun (oddly, despite its flaws).  The mouse controls are actually quite easy to use for steering and acceleration.  You need a full numeric keypad to use turn signals (easily, but you could reprogram to another key).  It's humorous, even when it shouldn't be (the people move like robots and look barely human at times).  I wouldn't recommend turning down random streets. 
 The learning curve is extremely difficult.  After 30 hours I can manage getting through routes on a few buses on two lines.  But it's relaxing, kind of like a truck simulator with some busy work to do.  The DLC is not inexpensive, and I'd recommend research --  a lot of reviews show some difficulty with some of the addons.  The game should have been much more optimized and should be running much more smoothly at this point-- hopefully, following some of the graphics settings as prescribed in the newer manuals will help.

Learning the many arcane processes for getting this simulation to work is no small feat. Don't bother trying to suck-it-and-see - there is [b]no realistic chance[/b] of you fully getting to grips with OMSI inside the 2-hour limit for refunds - it requires an enormous commitment of time and energy to achieve a working understanding of OMSI. (In that respect, I suspect it's not unlike actually learning to drive a real bus). 

Nothing about OMSI comes naturally, and when it calls itself a simulation, it really means this - the casual bus spotter need not apply - OMSI is for the most ardent bus enthusiasts. This shows in the small details - your bus will, for example, become progressively dirtier as the day goes on. It's an odd badge of pride for the dedicated OMSI bus driver to wear - a filthy bus speaks to a degree of devotion, of many hours spent plying your trade on the streets of Berlin. 

Casual players may direct themselves to other laughably titled ""Bus Simulator"" games for something a little more arcadey. The level of detail the simulation goes to is far in excess of any other product currently on the market, but this does mean that you're going to have to really [i]want[/i] to play OMSI. It takes effort just to get a bus in place to start driving, and that's before you've contrived to get the bus itself underway.

It's worth noting at this point that you shouldn't come into OMSI thinking that your experience of casually running freight around Europe in Euro Truck Simulator has prepared you for this game. It hasn't. Your opinion of SCS software will improve immeasurably when you play OMSI, as you realise what a deft piece of work ETS2 really is compared to the lumbering interfaces that OMSI provides.

If you've read this far, you may reasonably assume that I was in jest with my opening paragraph - you might surmise that I hate OMSI and wish nothing but ill upon those who created it. And sometimes that is true - when OMSI is behaving badly (which it does with alarming regularity) it is a hugely frustrating experience. Sitting in your bus while it bounces around madly, evidently experiencing one of OMSI's extremely localised seismic events, is the cause of considerable and frequent vexation (sadly I am not making this up - when things get a bit too much for OMSI to handle, the bus begins bouncing on the spot, with violence sufficient to launch it on a trip to the lower stratosphere if you don't act quickly to settle it by - oddly - switching to an external viewpoint).

All of that said though, when the planets align, and OMSI actually plays ball with you, it is a sublime experience. The graphics may be deeply primitive in this age of high-definition photorealism, but this ceases to matter far more swiftly than you would think. You'll be so preoccupied with the vast array of switches, toggles, rockers, buttons and levers that festoon the cab of each vehicle that you will scarcely have time to take in the scenery while you're stationary. Once underway, the mammoth task of carefully guiding your beige behemoth up to a perfect alignment with the kerb to take on passengers will further distract you from the cheerfully 1990s level of graphical complexity. 

With every facet of the vehicles modelled so fully, you will spend an entirely unreasonable amount of time adjusting the many aspects of the heating and ventilation system to get the temperature of the bus to hover at the 20C that German bus users evidently consider ideal. If you think this sounds like a living hell, don't be deceived - it's paradise. No amount of bouncing, lagginess or stuttering (which all abound in OMSI, alongside other depressing failings) can alter the unparalleled joy of guiding your bus out of the gates of Spandau Bus Garage and onto the open road for a day of shuttling Berliners between the U-Bahn Station at Ruhleben and the Spandau Loony Bin. 

OMSI is hard work, but if you put in the time to get to know it, it is also intensely rewarding. If you bring a deep interest in buses and a willingness to engage with the simulation and put in the hours, OMSI will become a great friend to you. But that friendship is hard-won and not to be taken casually - this is most assuredly a product for the hardcore.

I have played a lot of simulators, and driving around in the virtual world is one of my favourite hobbies. I've driven over 1000 hours in virtual trucks and over 1000 in virtual trains, so you'd think OMSI 2 is really the type of game for me.

And I'm still convinced this simulator is awesome, once you get past the tutorials and know how to actually drive a bus. And that's OMSI 2's main problem. The developers overcomplicated things, and the tutorial is trying to explain everything at once. That includes the 10 or so steps just to set up the bus heating system. Information overload! It doesn't really keep track of what steps you've already completed, and the hints to where the buttons are could be a lot better too. OMSI 2 tries to simulate every detail of driving a bus, and so the player has no option to start out simple first. In most simulators, getting a truck/train/plane/boat/tractor or whatever to move isn't really that hard. The controls are simplified and the tutorials clear. The real challenge is to master it, and more detailed controls are mostly optional. OMSI 2 totally skips that first part, and wants you to master bus driving right from the start, which makes it very inaccessible to new players. 

I got stuck in the tutorial, although I did try to read everything carefully, and looked up some extra information on the internet (it's actually pretty ridiculous that one has to find help to complete a tutorial). I refunded OMSI 2 while I still had the chance. It's a shame really, because I still really want to like this simulator. Driving a bus around town would still be something I love to do. But I'd recommend the devs to make it a lot more simpler for new players.

I was a bus driver myself and I must admit this game feels very realistic. In my life I was lucky to be able to pilot a plane and drive a train but I think this game gives the best feel of all transport simulator available. We also have realistic traffic (which is sometimes unfortunately a bit bugged) which is so essential to every city simulation game. What I really like to do is to learn a route and then drive it like in real life for whole day. There are no limitations - we can take out a bus early from the yard, drive it whole day according to the schedule and then take it back. Of course we can save the game and don't have to do it in one try. If we get bored we can instantly jump to another bus on another route or put a new bus into any place ourselves.

There are lot's of freeware add-ons both in terms of routes and busses. Therefore we can drive Solaris, MAN, Ikarus and many different models. There are great freeware routes (many of them are better than payware) both realistic and fictional so plenty to chose from.

The game has some limitations. The pedestrains sometimes behave weird, sometimes a car will bump into you without your fault but in general when we get to know these things we can start to ignore them. Good steering wheel is highly recommended for this game. Remember it's a simulator not a simple arcade. We really need a good feel of the wheel to fit these large busses into sharp corners. Still if you don't own a wheel, mouse playing is pretty effective. I do it often myself on the laptop when I don't want to take a wheel with me :) I don't recommend steering by keyboard.

You can try, you can set up your fancy steering wheel, clip on your TrackIR, have the IBIS app on your mobile phone of choice, even wear a floppy hat, but when you get started, you learn that the AI is just too dumb to play it seriously.

Part of the fun is the mishaps that happen on the way, which there will be many. Under the hood the game is actually pretty darn great, good bus physics, and the sound design is just one of the best in gaming history (and that is no joke). Collision physics suck, mind. Well, they're great if you want to shoot your own bus, or another bus, into the stratosphere. 

For the most part the quality of the content is good, very good in fact. Originally a tiny dev team it is clear that this was a labour of love, and that effort shows in the stock content and some of the DLC. SOME, not all. Very much like Dovetail, Aerosoft are willing to put any old map/vehicles on the Steam store to earn them some cash. This makes purchases very hit and miss, and finding reviews in a place other than Steam could be difficult. In general though, pretty good, and Omsi 2 has a great modding scene, some of which equal or even better the quality of official DLCS.

Omsi 2 is oddly engaging, and entertaining, and sort of falls into that realm of Farm Simulator or Eurotruck Simulator where really the game should be boring as hell, and maybe it is, but you still come back for more. There is a odd satisfaction of driving around a sleek, modern hybrid bus, or one of those real diesel smoke spewers of the 80s, you can practically smell the stubbed out cigarettes and that yellow liquid that could either be beer or urine or both.

What this game begs for is optimisation. The game engine of Omsi 2 is pretty much as good as it can get, DLC creators try their best to improve matters, but the core game itself could do with a proper polish up (pokes Aerosoft in the ribs, you listening?). I would love to see this in something like the Unreal Engine or Unity, doubt that would happen though. Any half decent rig should be able to make very few concessions in game settings, but don't expect constant 60s.

I have a lot of patience for games that quite clearly try, but this game doesn't try, at all. It's very buggy, unstable, poorly made, and is yet another title that give simulators a bad reputation.

The truth is that 30 â¬ for this poorly executed and clearly unfinished title is bordering on criminal (esp 4 years after release where it's still riddled with gamebreaking bugs), and charging 370 â¬ for the DLC, which is mostly nothing more than a a few more busses, is absolutely unacceptable. Sure, there is free modded content for the game, but the paid content simply isn't worth the price tag. The game is very unstable and unless you have enough RAM to load the entire map into memory when going into the game you'll be fighting with terrible stuttering and low framerate because the game for some reason refuses to use the GPU for the graphics. Without a proper settings menu there isn't much to do about the poor graphics or the performance, but you do need to move the FPS slider to 60 or higher where it belongs because for some obscure reason it's by default set to 30 fps. You also need to be aware that the default key assignments make no sense and don't correspond with any other game or simulator released in the past 30 years. You can redefine all the keys, thankfully, but you need to remember all 100+ key assignments because the prompts can't figure out to tell you the keys you've set and unless you're good at memorizing the layout of buttons in the busses, you need the shortcut keys to do anything.

It's quite clear that this game was made by a few guys with a dream, no money, and not enough resources to make their dream into what they wanted. It attempts 100% realism, which is fine, but it means you practically need to be an experienced (German) bus driver to play the game because it doesn't explain anything properly. The UI design needs a LOT of work and some serious effort need to be made into teaching you how to play the damn game.

The busses are very accurately modelled and every single button works and has a function, and with that comes the problem of actually playing the game: You need to know what every single button does and what every single warning light means, and what the correct procedure is for doing absolutely everything you need to do from getting the bus moving, to setting the route, to taking on passengers.
That wouldn't be so bad if the game made a decent effort at telling you how to operate the busses, using the IBIS (which normally is a multi-day class by itself if  you want to be a bus driver), or what each button is, but that is not the case. There's not a single tooltip anywhere and the tutorials are absolutely hopeless. If you can get through the awful excuse for a translation you'll quickly discover that the tutorials will ask you to do things that they never explain how to do, or that they require you to remember long convoluted procedures. The game also doesn't tell you whether your bus is ready to go or not; it's up to you to remember (memorize) every single step you need to take every time you start on a new route. There's no checklist or anything to remind you if you've missed anything - and there's a lot you can miss.",1495228227,1495229071,False,27,3,0.596922099590301514,1,True,False,False

These are mostly from people that don't want to put the time and energy in that's required to learn how to play OMSI2. Many of them claim to have decent machines to play OMSI on, well they don't because buses that jump and down only happen on low-spec PCs. 
This is a simulator and not some kind of dirt rally driving game. This is as realistic as it gets as far as bus simulators go and to be honest, this really is the only one of its kind out there at the moment. 

You have to learn how to select your route and line (Bus) number. You have to learn how to operate the buses because nearly every switch and button is modelled to work like the real buses. You have to learn how to use the ticket machine e.t.c. In other words, you have to read the PDF manuals and watch YouTube videos to help you familiarise yourself with the game.

The physics and sounds of the bus models are pretty darned good with suspension and the buses rattle and shake when driving over rougher roads with broken tarmac and pot-holes just like in real life. There are automatic announcements on some routes and you can even download the current real-world weather to drive in.

There is quite a lot of paid DLC to expand with more routes and more buses including lots of freeware maps too. 

The game is of course pretty old now and is not really optimised for todays PCs as it's only 32Bit and limited to 2Gb of RAM which is why you need to download the seperate 4Gb patch but its still a perfectly good working game and lot's of fun.

Since then big business have bought the rights, and turned it into a cash cow, churning out reems of DLC which, for the most part, are utter garbage.

I used to play this game, and actually like it, once I spent a few days figuring  out how to access the starting  points and through trial and error match which busses drove in which cities in which eras.All of this adds not so much to the charm as much as it does to the frustration. 

Recently I got a widescreen monitor and a muscled up my GPU to more modern standards. For some reason dialogue boxes now dissapear behind the game making them inaccessable; forcing a reboot. This is a known bug on some systems, and 'unfixable'. It sent the game over the edge for me making it unplayable. I mean in 4 hours I must have gone through 30 reboots ? 

 It was hard enough dealing with the unfriendly user interface, the lack of English and trying to figure out how to enter and drive an overcomplicated adaptation of what originally must have been a very efficient series of German bus routes. 

This game may have been worth buying at some point when it originally came out and the quirks could be excused in the name of 'indie development'. 

In its current state and at its outrageous price point, they are simply taking the piss.

The graphics, game engine and menus seem about 20 years old.

Poorly optimised - the framerate nosedives in certain areas.

Many, many bugs eg:
- Hold a button for a fraction of a second too long in the tutorial and it won't let you go back
- Then restarting the tutorial causes the game to crash
- Flip your bus and it falls through the road because the roof doesn't have a collision box

Serious localisation issues:
- Tutorials are written in very broken English
- During one of the tutorials, it tells you to press Shift+Z when you actually need to press Shift+Y (due to Germany using QWERTZ keyboards), and it won't let you proceed until you figure it out
- You are told to adjust a control in English, but they are all labelled in German. Tell us the German name as well, or at least provide tool-tips!

Controls:
- Despite claiming full joypad support, the joypad controls are far too sensitive; the slightest movement results in screeching tyres and complaining passengers. A separate program like Xpadder is required to use the more linear steering setup of the keyboard version.
- Some controls needlessly require separate on/off buttons to be mapped instead of a single toggle switch

Overpriced. You only get one map and a tiny tutorial map. Including more maps would make it a fairer price.

Good luck with getting through the poorly-translated, buggy tutorials and setting up the convoluted controls before your 2-hour refund window expires!


On the positive side, once the initial period of frustration is out of the way, it does provide a fairly satisfying in-depth simulation of bus driving. If you can overlook the many issues you should get some enjoyment out of it (you only need to look at the thousands of hours some of these other reviewers have ploughed into it to confirm that!), however it is very expensive and therefore I can only recommend it if this sort of thing really floats your boat. But don't expect anything as polished as something like ETS2 (which isn't saying much).",1481012511,1483169543,False,14,2,0.591499388217926025,0,True,False,False

That said, there is -NO- simulator as realistic and with the huge sortiment of maps and vehicles OMSI has. They have been quite slow in getting OMSI 2 stable and its engine is sort of outdated, but with a modern PC you can get a serious amount of fun even out of huge maps. Plus: the community has always been developing things for the community, that is: out of my 5-6 current standard maps only one is payware, and that one - Rheinhausen - is worth every bit. So don't mind the payware when testing, and if you like OMSI, it's a month's pocket money of a schoolboy compared to other DLC games like Train Simulator to get everything there is.

If you like versatility in maps / bus repaints / buses, and if you like a real simulator, there's no way around OMSI 2.

It is difficult to learn in the beginning and given that many things are written in German, it can be off putting. However, once you get the hang of it, it is a load of fun. It is the closest thing to becoming a bus driver yourself. 

Positives and Negatives: 

+: A true simulator. 
+: The busses are well made, most of the buttons, dials and switches have function and even the driver-side window has a beautifully annoying squeaky noise. 
+: Gameplay options â You can choose the level realism you would like. You can opt out of ticket selling, you can opt out of collisions and choose if your bus will encounter technical difficulties making the game easier when just starting out.
+: Active â While I enjoyed Euro Truck Simulator 2, the long stretches of road tended to put me to sleep. In OMSI 2, you mostly travel through cities, must pay attention to the route and stop every few minutes to let passengers on and off. 
+: I had also tried out Bus Simulator 16 the same time as OMSI 2, I found OMSI2 a bit more realistic in the sense that passengers didnât always get on at every bus stop or off at every bus stop. Just like in real life, there is no need to stop sometimes. 

+/-: While focusing on being a bus simulator, the people are rather ugly in the game and look as if theyâve just witnessed a murder. Itâs not really that big of a deal butâ¦itâs there. 
+/-: While I enjoy the simulator, I might be nice to see a few other âgameâ aspects added in to make it more rewarding. Taking all the time it takes to go through a route, doing what you need to do, the only thing you get at the end is a timetable which shows you how punctual you were. While thatâs all well and good, it doesnât feel all that rewarding in the end. After that timetable, you can travel the same route but in the other direction. 

-: Price â Itâs expensive and the DLCs are usually pricy as well. However, with Steamâs refund policy, this isnât as big of an issue anymore. Buy a DLC, play it a bit and if you like it, keep it or just get a refund to try another one. 
-: Loading times can be long and the game can be rather buggy.
-: There are many times I felt the tutorial was unclear and programming the IBIS can be a pain in the neck.
-: There is still plenty of German in the game, which can make things difficult when you canât remember all the buttons. Also, when programming the IBIS or using the bus modifications in one of the DLCs, the menus are all in German. It would be nice to see the game fully in English.

I personally would love to see the game redone a bit so it functions better, becomes less buggy and is fully in English but I doubt it will ever happen. The graphics could be better but I feel the simulator looks good where it really needs it, making it easy to look the other way. 

All in all, if you enjoy simulators or busses, I think this one should be given a shot.

-Busses are historically accurate and have amazing detail
-Big variety of busses from the 80\'s-90\'s with loads of skins (Ads)
-Very authentic map and also historically accurate
-Wide variety of lines/routes through the map
-Features tutorial for beginners (OMSI is very advanced)
________________________________________________________________________________
CONS:
-Can be difficult to learn, as this is a very advanced simulator with almost every button on the bus clickable
-Is unstable & laggy, you\'ll need a powerful PC to run on stable FPS (30-45)
-Graphics of pedestrians aren\'t very good and are very repetitive
-Some buildings may have very low textures
-AI Cars aren\'t very smart and they can easily crash into you (No worries, you can turn Collisions off in OMSI)
-Very tight schedule to follow
________________________________________________________________________________
All in all, OMSI 2 is a very great simulation but has minor cutbacks and bugs, glitches, and is as stable as it\'s going to get (30-45 FPS). Personally, I would recommend this because of how authentic it is bus-wise, and how everything in the bus is clickable. But caution, you will need a powerful PC and lowered settings to run this game stable. If you get bored of the same old busses, lines/routes, there are various add-ons you can buy to expand the OMSI universe (Maps & Busses).

Buses are excellent to drive and some have computer on board telling you the status of the bus. The bus physics is quite nice to as you wont be able to make sharp turns under high speed.

OMSI comes with a total of 15 buses, all made by M.A.N and were used in Berlin in the 1980s/90s. This game also comes with 2 maps (Grundorf and Spandau, Berlin) and are pretty well detailed. This OMSI is cirtainly one of THE BEST bus simulators out there, even though it is very buggy. The DLCs are also highly detailed, and are at very competative prices when compared with DLC for Dovetail Games' RailWorks.

You may notice that (when you boot the game for the first time) no passengers will buy any tickets, this is not a glitch/bug, you need to change your settings by:
1. Press ""p"", this will pause the game. Esc. also works to pause the simulation, but the time still passes, press p first
2. Press Esc.
3. Find ""Options""
4. This will open a new window, find ""Ticket Selling""
5. Open the Drop-Down Menu.
6. Select ""Easy"" or ""Advanced""
7. Click ""ok""

9. Press ""p""
10. Continue driving :-)

There are many games out there that wrongly claim to be a simulator, not this one. Without a doubt this is the most realistic bus simulator available. Itâs definitely not game that you just can pick up and play and you wonât get very far without at least taking a look at the manual. 

The standard game comes with two maps, a small fictional map and Spandau in Berlin set in the years 1986 to 1994 with a selection of MAN buses from that era. As well as the official payware content there is tons of map and bus mods available adding greatly to the experience. My personal favorite mods are the Bowdenham and Szczecin Maps 

First off the good points. The game is extremely realistic the buses handle accurately and every switch and lever is clickable. You can control almost every aspect in operating the bus including ticket sales, destination displays, doors, lights, heating and so on. In the Berlin map, there is a chrono feature where the route and varies and ticket prices change depending on the time period selected. There is selectable weather conditions that can affect how the bus handles. 

Too often, games are often let down by poor sounds but not in OMSI 2 where they are truly excellent, the buses sound just like the real thing. Almost every sound is recreated such as the suspension rattling on bumpy roads, the whine of the transmission and even dashboard button sounds.

Now to the bad points. The graphics arenât particularly great by modern standards and the game is poorly optimized. It will take quite a bit of time tinkering around with the settings to get respectable framerates. The AI traffic is dreadful often crashing into you but thankfully AI collisions can be turned off. More casual players may find themselves a little overwhelmed by the lack of ingame help. Some may also find the price a bit steep and itâs never included in the Steam sales.

Despite these issues, itâs definitely not a bad effort considering it was made by just two guys from Germany and not some big developer with a massive budget. In a way this game is kind of like an old Italian sports car in that much of the time it wonât run properly and will completely infuriate you but the times when it does work, itâs just brilliant and sounds epic.

So to sum up, OMSI 2 may frustrate at first but give it a chance and it can become very enjoyable. You may even learn a little bit of German in the process. If you like very detailed simulators and have an interest in buses I would definitely recommend it.",1461102250,1461102250,True,18,3,0.665080249309539795,0,True,False,False

- Passengers don't talk too much unless they have to (you can drive like crazy and they will complain)
- Collisions are not realistic, but as long as you drive well, you don't bother about it anyway
- Performance and stability issues sometimes (4 GB patch + loading the whole map helps a little)

Read the manual, read the guides, do all the tutorials. You'll get the hang of it and enjoy it.

Nice graphics. Yeah, so it probably doesn't look like most modern games, but you don't really need all that post-processing and overdone graphics to get real immersion. This game feels very real.

You drive on bus routes with a timetable, pick up passengers, sell them tickets, and drop them off at their destinations.

Pros:
Realistic controls. Each control on the dashboard does exactly what it would do on a real bus.
Great sound effects. The buses sound just like they do in real life, with gear changes, shakes, bumps, etc. There are also some nice sound details like outside ambient sounds becoming louder when windows are open.
Nice weather effects including rain and snow.
Large variety of different buses to drive, including single deckers, double deckers, and bendy buses.
Includes a map editor so you can edit existing maps or make your own.
Various mods that add extra buses, maps, etc.

Cons:
No Steam Workshop support for mods.
The English version of the game isn't fully translated, and some dialogue boxes are still in German.
Performance isn't great. You might have to lower the settings on larger maps to get a decent frame rate. Even on a high end PC it struggles on max settings.
The game can be unstable at times and randomly crash.
Only 2 maps are included with the base game. There are some DLC maps but you have to buy them separately.

Overall I would give OMSI 2 a 7/10. It's pretty realistic, but it can be unstable and does lack in content without buying DLC or installing mods.

The AI vehicles act realistic, like indicating one direction and going the other. They try to cut you up & cross lanes just in front of you. Go through red lights. Try & beat you at getting somewhere first. This is a real challenge with collisions turned on. However, buggy AI vehicles 'ghost' through themselves & tend to collide with you. So its probably best to keep collisions off ATM.

Theres no company bosses to answer to. You just get in a bus, select a timetable & away you go!!! Or, if your like me, play a freelance driver. Set a destination, head that way & pickup or drop off whoever you come across. Theres no company bosses to answer to. This is only to mention a few things. Its practically a 'digital job' !!

Flip side of that is its very slow for updates & bug fixing. I understand theres been internal issues going on causing these long delays. Still buggy a bit as mentioned and theres been an ongoing problem for many with Multithreading. Turned on makes the game more stable but at the cost of performance.

This is the worlds most in depth and buggiest Bus simulator! 

It's really a hit-and-miss game. From th e first purchase, there's not much content unless you buy quite a bit of DLC. The vanilla flavor of the game has only a whopping two maps to drive your Bus in, and only a handful of different buses to drive, many of them seem to be repeats. How ever, despite the two maps, one of them does have many different routes for you to take, so that's nice. From my experience, the other just has one.

This game does have a bit of a steep learning curve, and it did take me several attempts of picking it up and trying to go through the tutorials to figure out what was what, and then once I got that down, I had to try and set keys for my Logitech G27, which only added to the complexity, as you have more controls you need to be aware of for your bus then allowed on the Racing wheel's extra buttons. I'm not kidding, you literally control everything on the Bus. From doors to heating system, to interior lights to opening and closing your driver side window! 

Beyond that, driving a bus, picking up and unloading passengers is actually kind of fun. If you find a route that you like, you can find yourself sinking some time into this game, if you like running around in circles, that is. Of course you have to make sure you are not late, punch tickets, print tickets, give change to passengers, etc etc. 

The biggest thing that stops me from enjoying this game is that it crashes for no apparent reason with almost no indication of an update from the developers in the near future. The last update, according to steam, was in May. This really makes you wonder if the developers are doing something for this game or not, or if I've missed something.. Granted they are adding DLC but there has been reports of crashes happening still. 

There are mods you can download and add into this game, but I haven't dabbled to much. It might help you out, maybe fix the game crashes, but you should proceed with caution.

Despite the game crashing bugs and the hard-to-learn controls, this game is .. Tolerable. Adequate. I would love to see where the developers take this game, but as far as I know, it's a hit-or-miss situation. Should you get it? Honestly, I wouldn't, at least not right now. The bugs in this game are to much to bare to really enjoy it. Believe me, I wanted to enjoy this game, but when it crashes in the middle of a route, I find that to be a little disappointing. You might have better luck then I do, and if you want to try your luck, go for it. Otherwise, I would stay away.",1412553178,1443623740,False,44,0,0.537180006504058838,0,True,False,False

If you don't mind some quirks there is a lot to like here. The detail on the bus models is amazing and the sheer complexity of all the things you can alter and change on the bus is quite overwhelming to begin with. Reading the manual and having a pen and paper handy to make some notes is a must. The attention to detail in the sound is something to behold. After a bit of digging on google I discovered that the destinctive transmission sound was so familiar because the busses that used to transport me to and from school in the UK used the same transmission as the double deckers on OMSI. 

Learning the routes takes some time and keeping to the schedule is very hard to do without upsetting the passengers. If you want a real driving challenge this will keep your mind active for a long time. There is just so much to consider all at once. It's very hard not to become flustered at first. Stay with it and you start to become pretty addicted to the challenge of getting that bus there in one piece on time with satisfied passengers. A lot of love has gone into this by the creators who have succeeded and then some IMO of encapsulating a period of history inside a game that brings a great deal of enjoyment to play.

Whilst the graphics don't look very pleasing, the buses themselves are VERY well modelled, as well as their audio. As NerdÂ³ said, it's got quite possibly the best sound I've ever heard in a game.


I've said enough, so here's some pros/cons:

Pros:
* Great simulation
* Bloody amazing audio
* Well modelled buses
* Rather moddable

Cons:
* Crashes a lot
* AI leaves a lot to be desired. Pulling to the right, indicating to the right, then turning left, cutting me up and crashing into the side of my bus? Thanks mate.
* Graphics engine leaves a lot to be desired.
* Performance is mediocre at best.",1437364418,1437364418,True,6,0,0.587273120880126953,0,True,False,False

Basically if you want to know whether you should buy it or not - if you don't want to drive a bus don't get it, simple as, but that's the obvious. It comes with a few paid DLC packs, including Vienna, Hamburg and recently released Chicago which are all good, but some people don't realise you can download so many third party maps and buses.

It's one of the best driving simulators there is, in my opinion. It's just very prone to errors and freezing, it's not fully developed and at least for now it's easy to work around once you know what goes wrong. However, it really does make up for it for the amount of third party maps and buses you can download. Downloading maps - things very easily go wrong and that's where OMSI can hopefully improve in the future, in making the game stable and simpler to use, possibly. Once you understand basics of downloading buses and maps then it is usually easy to work with.

I wouldn't recommend buying the game if you aren't going to download any maps however. You'll only have Berlin-Spandau and Grundorf which get very boring after a while. There are so many maps you can find, small and big ones.

So what's so good about OMSI?

+ The buses are very high quality, and almost every button in the cab works. Every little function in the bus actually works. Even the driver window slides! The bus sounds are top notch, and this game has one of the best sound engines I've ever heard.
+ The game simulates passengers, and it does it very well. The passengers evaluate your bus driving, and will moan at you if the bus is too cold or too warm or you attempt to short change them. They will want to get off your bus if your driving is not up to scratch!
+ The game fully simulates a 24 hour clock, and various types of weathers such as rain, snow, fog, etc. You will notice less cars and passengers at night, and lots more at rush hours. 
+ OMSI has a huge modding scene, which means you can download tons of new maps and buses for free. There's always more to do, and you don't have to fork out Â£24.99 cause you want some different scenery. 
+ Timetables are fully simulated, and AI buses follow them just like you. You can even take over an AI bus if you wish. 
+ The included Berlin map clearly had a lot of detail put into it. Compare it on Street view or compare images and the similarities become obvious right away. 
+ The game is supported with Official DLC's which are of great quality. 
+ The game has full steering wheel support which is really great if you have one. 

Okay, so what about the negatives?

- The game WILL micro-freeze and suffer from framerate issues. If you are really really sensitive to issues like this, I would not recommend it. If like me you are willing to look past these issues, you will be fine. It doesn't prevent me from enjoying the game. 
- There are various bugs here and there such as the AI hitting you sometimes, passengers noclipping through bus stop shelters, etc. 
- The graphics are by no means amazing and they could be better, but I do think they do the job. 
- The game can be intimidating at first and the tutorials really are quite useless, don't bother with them. 
- The settings can be hard to configure, and aren't as simple Low, Medium and High. This can also be seen as a good thing as you can customise them best to your system.

AI buses take passengers, just like player's bus. Whenever he likes, player can jump to bus controlled by AI, and take control, leaving his own bus to AI. 

Routes are long, some of them demanding, tight schedeules etc. Lots of fun.
Day-night/weather effects also are implemented. Want to drive night bus, rainy/snowy day ? Did you know that wet / snowy streets change how ie. braking system works ? On a frosty day not setting properly air conditionig will cause passengers start to complain thet its to cold in the bus.

Graphics may not look so awesome like in newest FPS games, but this one has unique setting and feel, and is highly detailed.

After reducing threads (or what ever was that option called that the game itself proposed after the first crash) helped a lot to the crashing. It still has some random crashes but not too often. Sometimes you manage to lose open window somehow behind the game so that you cannot access it anymore and there seems to be no way to get the window on front again. Sometimes the game doesn't seem to recognize when you arrive to the last stop and then I have to drive a little loop to arrive the stop again. And the line destination setting doesn't work if you write the destination with all minor letters even it looks like that the destination is found from the drop down many correctly, cure for this is to open the line setting window again and press okay (since this time the game has set the minor/major cases correctly), if you fail to notice that you might lose passengers since they don't recognize the arriving bus to be their one.

Still, after knowing these bugs you can get decent ""game"" play and at least I enjoyed it a lot. Driving ain't easy but you will learn it.

The game is a good game, but for the price I paid i feel ripped off.

the game crashes MANY times trying to start, then the passengers comlain and get off if you drive like a normal person, or drive mad. no matter what they all always want to get off the bus even though im driving same speed as the cars and on a straight road etc.

then the game will crash and you only get sound and you hear your bus drive and crash into something as the picture froze, and you have to close the game in task manager and restart..

lets just say.... i HAVE NOT MANAGED TO DRIVE MORE THEN 18 MINUTES WITHOUT IT CRASHING COMPLETELY! 

I am angry i paid this amount and i cant even get through one route.

OH AND THE TUTORIAL IS UNABLE TO COMPLETE.. first the scrollbars never appear so you cannot click next as the buttons gone.. so to fix that you have to change font scale to small, meaning you need magifing glass to read anything on the screen when not playing the game.. or move it back and forth before and after you play.

then when you do tutorial 2.. you drive into a cudisack (sorry cant spell it so its probs spelt wrong) to turn the bus around, then it crashes with over 20 error messages and picture freezes, so you cannot finish the tutorial, so i still not sure on things.. for example what do you do with the petrol icon that never lights up? do you need to find a petrol station? how? and then you get to the last tutorial telling you to turn on resitors etc... WTF IS THAT? I COULDNT GET FAR ENOUGH IN THE TUTORIALS TO FIND OUT!

I really hope the developers fix this issue.. either way ive been RIPPED OFF.

NOTE: Once it finally works, it will be the best game ive played in a long time... its the bugs and crashes that spoil it...

so .... for the time being, until the stupid bugs are fixed.. i cant recommend this game... once its fixed, i will change it to positive as its a great game... IF IT ONLY WORKED FOR MORE THEN A FEW MINUTES!",1421935857,1421935857,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was hesitant to buy it 6 or so months ago due to price and graphics looking iffy.  Watched a youtube  video and even that said somthing about it being good but complicated.  So i waited.

All I can say is I need help!  I can't stop playing it.  The sounds are phenomenal, the every button works is awesome.  I haven't setup my TrackIR yet, but i plan to, but even without it... it's awesome fun.  The graphics aren't the greatest but they're not horrible.  I don't even notice it anymore.  It's just relaxing fun to drive around and pickup passengers.

I own the base game and three generations.  Both, I highly recommend.  I plan to get all the DLC.

I simply wish there was more maps and buses to choose from.  It does have a learning curve but not much of one.  Getting over the trying to figure out German when I have no idea what anything says was difficult, but I finally know my ZEIL CODES! 

Highly recommend this simulator if you're a simulator fan.  

I own and really enjoy Euro Truck Sim 1 and 2, I've seen questions asked. Though Euro Sim is great fun, it's not really comparable.

First of all....all you know that if someone is searching for a good sim of bus...this is the only one and the number 1...the others are pure fantasy and are not simulations.
Second....the graphic is not the maximum you can have today and it's heavy to manage but if you set rightly the options i assure to you all that this sim can run fluid 100x100 also on a old core duo 2 with a medium graphic card (nividia 650gtx 1 giga cost around 100 euro or less) the important step into options is go iimeadiatly to choice the year of the computer you want to set the game to...it's not important what computer you have but if you set there the good choice for you the game run like an arrow and the probe of it is when you run the game go to take a look at mirrors...if they show you a fluid scene without scattering you have got the target setting.
Third....the audio is amazing and the sensation of moving on the road is very great also if you use like me a wheel without forcefeedback.
Foorth....it's very easy also if it don't work ever..adding a mod map and out there there are many made better then originals.
Fifth.....the target for to have max fun is arrive to give tickets and money back to people that board your bus...it's not easy...it's not for all ...but it give you a sensation of proud.
Substancially the game it's a real simulation of a bus and can give to all players great satisfactions and it have a long life thks to many mods you can find easily out in internet simply digiting in google......OMSI 2 mod maps.

Itâs one of the most realistic bus simulators you will ever have the chance of playing, unless you have driven an actual bus that is. Instead of taking place during the early 1980âs like the previous version, OMSI 2 takes place in Germany during the late 80âs, early 90âs around the time the Berlin wall fell. Since the gameplay is unscripted, you are given the freedom to choose your bus, the bus route and the weather conditions. There are no guidelines to follow; you are given the freedom to do as you wish. The feeling of freedom is present as you drive through Germany from one destination to another, dropping your customers off at their locations. For a change of pace, it felt good not having a story to follow or missions to complete.

OMSI 2âs gameplay can overwhelm the player in the beginning, but as long as you use the provided tutorial system, youâll be driving through Germany in no time. Itâs possible to play the game if you decide to skip the tutorial but you will need prior knowledge of the previous game to do that. There are far too many instruments to use and procedures to remember, itâs very similar to piloting a plane in a flight simulator.

The in-game physics are incredibly realistic as you can almost âfeelâ every bump and turn you make.  Squeaks, squeals and rattles are heard from inside the bus every time you step on the break, hit a speed bump or even put on the parking brake. OMSI 2 is optimized for a steering wheel configuration, but this can be compromised with a keyboard/mouse combination.
OMSI 2 is an in-depth simulator that is not only complex, but entertaining to play, it may take the casual gamer a bit longer to grasp the gameâs complexity, but with some patience it can be done.",1413711241,1413711241,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

Let me break it down for you, the gameplay is amazing, it is very realistic driving (even with the mouse and keyboard), but it had some issues too. The game is not really optimised, so you will not be having the highest frame rates, but since not much is going on, it is not much of a problem. Additionaly, alot of things (errors messages, some tutorials, and other things as of this time) are in German, so you might have some issues there, though it is constantly getting better in English so I do not see this as a problem. My last complaint is that the menus are not very good, and it is confusing to learn how to get around them. Now on to the good stuff. The driving is excelent, and it is just a very good game if you are willing to put in the time to learn how to use it properly.

I would not recommend this game to anyone who already have OMSI 1 (as there are not many changes), or who is not that into this type of simulator, there are many others out there to make sure you like it first.

Right from the very get go you are left completely wanton, now i realise that this is a german sim but come now guys not everyone speaks german, what use is it of me downloading an english install only to have everything in german (one demerit). Okay so moving on seeing as there is apparently no way around this, next we have the interface, while it could be a little bit more userfriendly and perhaps presented in a more visually appealing way after playing around with it you should be able to navigate it with relatively minimal stress, which brings us to the tutorials, while relatively straight forward actual translation of that information becomes somewhat cumbersome because the keys are not quite mapped as described in the tutorial (Shift Z for example is actually Shift Y). So alas feeling rather chipper with myself having ever so painfully navigated the first few steps i find myself confronted with a situation which requires me to pan the camera in order to view a certain piece of equipment, now take into consideration i am using a laptop which has no center mouse button an up to which time i was dreading not to have to come across such a situation so needless to say dead in the water. Now the point been here that that while there is some kind of game controller customization (ie, key mapping etc albeit very limited) there appears to be no hat switch functionality, further more precise tuning for racing wheels such as the driving force gt and so on which have 900 degrees of turning radius more or less is extremely lacking and to be quite honest borders on non exsistance. Okay so resigning myself to the fact that it'll take me forever and a day to actually do a successful trip (passngers the works) i decide to just jump into the game based on what little info i've manged to muster up and here goes im in the bus its actually running and in gear everything seems like we good to go so give her the gas and bam im bouncing, crashing scrapping the whole works, more like a rodeo than a bus ride okay so i let things settle down a bit (apparently if you crank the graphics settings too high the game goes beserk all this despite having a more than capable machine so lower the settings and things seem to be a bit better, now just to perhaps say something obvious, im paying for an experince in its full glory and not some half blur world and footlong draw distances but anyway moving on...) so driving along now everything is just dandy trying to get a feel for things go and step on the brakes and half near fly out the windshield (theres that pesky precise game controller tuning thing again) so basically you want to use the brakes with without actually using them hmmmm go figure. So In a nutshell ive owned this game for two days and thats about the progress ive made, esentially as much progress as a moss growing up the side of an old english castle wall. Now before the naysayers get all excited i am yet to try it out on another machine which is more than a monster enough to push the graphics, did i mention that the laptop is no slouch either btw pretty sure i did but anyway thats that. For the record i am a hardcore die hard sim fanatic so pls reserve otherwise personal vendettas to your loo, i know the benchmarks of great sims and this one while it will have its second day of rekoning with me on a different machine at which time its final judgement will be passed as it stands i give it 1.5 out of 5.

2:Grathic looks ok but can still be improved.

The game has an huge community (mostly german but there are also enough english speakers) with an large database of FREE mods like: new busses, new maps/routes, bus modifications, reskins etc.
It's also very easy to mod it by yourself. 

[b]DRIVING:[/b]
[i](Please note: I'm using a steering wheel with force feedback as controller, this adds more driving pleasure to the game. It might be different when using a mouse or keyboard as controller)[/i]
I start off with the most important thing of the game, driving!
When you get in your bus for the first time, it could be a bit overwelding. The amount of buttons and switches are enormous. It isn't an easy to pick up game. If you want the full experience out of the game, you need to invest some time in it to learn how it works (the errors and the AI behaviour is a bit odd so in the beginning this can be quite frustrating but after some time you know how they respond so you can change your way of driving on it), and of course how to drive the damn thing ;-). 

If you get the hang of it you will see that it's quite fun and challenging to drive a bus. You have 12 meters behind you to keep an eye on and a schedule. You also need to take care of your passengers that want to be comfortable and on time at their destination.

[b]PERFORMANCE[/b]
Omsi doesn't run on a fancy big graphic engine. Even the fastest PC can have some lag in this game. Omsi hasn't got a stable frame rate because the scenery is on any place different. But I can give you some predictions of what frame rate you will get:
Low-end PC: 10-18 FPS
Mid-end PC: 20-40 PFS
High-end PC: 30-60 PFS

I know 18 FPS doesn't sounds much but there isn't really much fast action so it's acceptable and playable.

[b]MODDING[/b]
Omsi is a great game to mod! It has an open folder structure so you basically don't need to install any tools to get going. It takes time to know how to mod but an experienced modder shouldn't have any problems with it. 

Installing mods is as easy as extracting an archive file. And the good news is, they are all free!
But when you want to instal a new map for the first time, you will find yourself getting loads of errors due to missing files. For many maps you need to download a whole list of other objects or maps to get going. But once you've installed a couple maps, you don't get many errors any more because most maps use the same objects.

[b]CONCLUSION[/b]

+ Realistic driving physics and controls
+ Huge amount of detail
+ Fun to drive
+ Large amount of free available mods
+ Easy to mod 
+ Best (bus) driving simulator

- Crashes sometimes
- Some bugs
- not easy to pick up (you need to invest some time to learn how the game works)
- Not suited for everyone

I would definitely recommend this game if you like simulators. It's one of the best driving sims out there (yes, it beats Euro Truck Simulator 2 on the driving experience). If you can ignore the bugs and you are open to spend some time on learning the game and read some tutorials that you would have hours of fun with this game!

It's been almost 3 years since OMSI 1 came out, and a long journey from 2012 announcement has ended. It's finally here, but does it stand up to the name of great simulation like the last one? Is it worth the asking price? Let's find out.

After starting the game, pretty simple menu greets you. It has everything including tutorial, options, starting new game. Everything is self explanatory. Options may be confusing for people who aren't really into computers and configurations, but I'd say, set overall settings to PC 2006 or 2011 (options names) and you're good to go. Controls could be confusing too, but driving on keyboard (even is game is designed STRICTLY for steering wheels) is pretty well done, and is fun. I've had no problems setting up two steering wheels in it. After short configuration, I've finally started the game up. After pretty long loading, game had no bus whatsoever. So I've pressed ALT, and then a simple menu came out of nowhere. That little thing is handyas from here you can get new bus from there, fix it, choose timetable or change the Bus display. There is a lot to have fun with. So I've choosen Advertised MAN NG272 and then the fun began. First of all, this game is not for casuals. You need to know what exatly you need to do in order to start the electricity, engine, and then finnaly move your bus. You need a basic knowledge of how buses work in order to find OMSI 2 fun. So after some clicking with mouse on virtual cockpit of my NG272, I've finally heard this bearutifull beast. WOW the sound design is AMAZING. Everything is in place, even creeking of the joint of the Bus. Sound quality is TOP NOTCH. It's better than most games out there. 

Graphics however aren't that great. 2D trees crossed to make a 3D like impression, 2D bushes, and blocky buildings with pretty low-res textures and berlinians who walk pretty badly... but who the hell looks at graphics in simulation? Bus Models are top notch. Well detailed, well textured. However the deal breaker could be optimisation. It lacks a bit, but it's certainly better than the first one. After configurations you can get most out of it, that's why everything is so complicated in options menu. I'd recommend setting Texture Max Memory to max of your graphic card. Lags in game could be a little annoying while loading next map tiles, but you'll get used to it. Ai can also be pretty jerky, and pretty tough to cooperate with, but hey, when you get used to it, it doesn't really matter. We all need to give credit to Marcel Kuhnt and Rudeger Hulsmann (yes, those two guys created this game) for even doing such a great job on other aspects of the game. 

Physics are top notch. Every bump has it's feeling. You feel the mass of the bus, and also how well in handles (when of course you know HOW to drive a bus). You will feel significant difference driving on snow, and or dry asphalt. It's incredibly well made. What shines in this game is it's flexibility. You can do everything you want in bus. Open windows, manually open doors, press all buttons on cockpit and see what they do. It's like, literally, you can do EVERYTHING you always dreamed of with a bus, including even manipulating Roll-Band displays. 

Another great thing is it's modability. You can install user created buses, maps, scenery objects, sounds, Ai etc into this game. What's even more awesome, is that OMSI 2 is backwards compatible with all user created content for OMSI 1. Yay!

For what it is, and for what it provides, yes, OMSI 2 is worth the money. Your childhood dreams of being bus driver finnaly came true, and what's more important, they are on steam, available to everyone. Aswell as Euro Truck Simulator 2, HEED THE MOCKERS. Don't listen to anybody who say that simulation games suck, because you will miss the pinnacle of simulation games on PC. However you look at this game, it's maybe not perfect, but it's excusable, due to low human resources of MR Software. I mean, come on. I've never saw two people creating such good game with such attention to detail. After starting up OMSI 1 and OMSI 2, I felt like they were both passionate about busses. Bus driving seems boring to some people, but believe me - it's a hard job. Those two guys captured the true feeling of that job. Game itself shows how much they loved what they did in this game. It shows how dedicated both Marcel and Rudiger are to simulation and re-creation of real-life feeling of such universal job. Yes, animations are lacking,  graphics too, and optimisation a bit aswell, but we cannot deny the fact, that nothing beats the OMSI 2 in terms of physics, sound and design. Other companies (Including TML Studios) cannot even think of being close to what OMSI 2 did. I won't spoil how many new things are in game. Certainly MAN NG272, thus argiculated bus support is there, which is a very nice touch. There have been improvements, and they certainly add even more depth to already impressive and deep simulation.

It's a good game, for a good price. Pick it up if you're not affraid of it's downs.

Omsi 2 is just like the first one, but they added 2 new lines, (which started after the berlin wall fall) and a new Bendy bus. I personally tought that 30 euro was a bit to much for this game since it's not like they added 10 new lines.. But since I veichle lover and loved the first Omsi but the lack of a bendy bus ruined it a lil bit for me. Since so many people voted this game down I was quite hesitent to buy it but I really wanted to drive that bendy bus so I did buy it, and if you are really into this kind of simulator games then it's totally worth it, BUT, if you don't care of the slightly new lines and the bendy bus, then I would recomend you to stay with Omsi 1 since there isn't to much new stuff here. There is a ton load of mods and new maps for it aswell if you get board of that 1 line. And lastly, the first Omsi doesn't have all these annoying bugs and glitches like this one got.

However, there's something special about OMSI2 - Der Omnibussimulator 2, or simply put: The Bus Simulator 2 in English. It's truly magnificent if you want Germans to swear at you or if you want to waste half an hour on figuring out what ""Ernerungsterif"" or""Betriebsfahrt"" means. It'll leave you frantically skimming though the manual as you try and figure out why the bus all of a sudden seized to move (curse you, auto kneeling mechanism), however all is forgotten the moment you roll out of the depot on a dark Sunday night as you make your way to your first stop though the calm Berlin streets. There's nothing quite like driving a night bus in BS2, your passengers, albeit few and far in between, really gives you a sense of satisfaction. Sure the passengers has about as much excitement and enthusiasm as the performers in a strip club has during their 9AM Monday morning performances but they still sit there in your bus, quietly waiting for their destination, they leave you thinking about who they really are. Is the younger chap five rows down making his way across town at his lovers behest.

The technical aspect of BS2 is less so, it crashes as frequently as Lindsey Lohan runs out of cocaine. The graphics is about as exciting as a carton of milk is to look at, you're lucky to find a tree with at least one polygon and god forbid you leave the carefully designated routes as you will encounter the sky dome with no warning whatsoever if you do.

BS2 shouldn't be good, it shouldn't make me want to play it for hours on end, but something about is just so appealing. Maybe it's because the two people (really, two people made this) made this game purely based on the fond memories they had when they rode on the buses operating on the Berlin Municipal bus lines 25 odd years ago.

It's pure nostalgia and passion, the audio side of the game is nothing short of perfect and the game itself is nothing short of amazing. It doesn't take more than a minute or so behind the wheel of my bus of choice before I'm sitting feeling quite content with life.

The review submission page asks whether or not I recommend this game. Yes, BS2 is as polished as Battlefield 4 is and still are. Yes, it really is about driving a bus.

It's not for everyone, but I do recommend this in a heartbeat if you have even a vague desire to play this.

I do, however, feel that I need to add more requirements to the list provided by the publisher:

You need a gamepad, preferably a wheel in order to drive in a way that doesn't look like you've had 6 racks of beer and 7 bottles of vodka.
It's also based in Germany so there's quite a bit of German language involved. They do have transcripts of what type of ticket the passenger wants in English as well as a manual and quick reference guide. But every single switch, knob and control interface on the buses are in German, good luck figuring out what a ""Regler HeizlÃ¼fter vorne"" or a""Nebelschlussleuchte"" is. 
The quick reference guide will save your life when you're in a bus full of people at FreudStrasse that won't move an inch.",1387827599,1387827599,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Please mind, that game is using only one core of processor and is 32bit so doesn't matter if you have big memory. Overclocked CPU and graphic card with at least 1GB memory will do magic. When you set antialiasing and so on graphics to override and fiddle with settings in the game, you can make it work easily. 

Bugs after release: I have experienced some weird behaviour. Game crashing and so on, but after verification through Steam it downloaded some missing files so I think this is more Steam error that of Omsi developers. After that the game is not crashing anymore.

Contenet from Omsi 1: I had some problems, but it was pointed to me, that I was missing some files. After installing missing files, I managed to run all 5 of my favourite addons without any issues.

Graphics: Yes, it is not state of the art, it is not very well optimized, but for me it is enough. I can create my own sceneries and other content.

Physics and realism: There is no real simulator, FSX, Trainz, or this Omsi. But Omsi is trying to get to deep details in siimulation. What you don't get on performance or graphics, you will be repaid when feeling the drive. In other games you don't feel connected, physics are off. In Omsi it feels spot on even no game has real world physics.

Details: You have button and gauge for everything like in real bus... And I mean every little button that is in the game is functional. You have realistic smoke coming out from exhaust, sounds of transimission, axles, doors, rattling of loose parts in interior. This is what you don't get in ""fun"" games. You may think you are getting very little for the price, but if you grasp the amount of detail in this game you will get it.
