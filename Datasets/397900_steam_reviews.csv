However, I have won two or three games, and during those games when the clock gets to zero, the game just freezes. Not in the sense that I can't do anything, I can quit the game. But it never reaches the end game screen so I cannot get credit for my winning. I sat for 10 minutes past the game finish. The matches were tournaments too, so that definitely blows.

Glad this game is free, or I'd be upset that I wasted money to lose some games, and then lose the others too.",1578000173,1578000173,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
