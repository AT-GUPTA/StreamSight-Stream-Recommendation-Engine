Even playing with a Free to Play account is a decent way to know what the game's about, but a membership doesn't hurt.

That being said, if you decide this game is for you, *please* consider switching over to the RuneLite client after getting your bearings, it's a third-party client that's been approved by Jagex (You can find a link to it on their website) and makes a world of difference.
