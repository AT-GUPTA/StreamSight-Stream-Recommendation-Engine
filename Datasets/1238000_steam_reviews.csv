In my opinion; the game got bagged on more than it deserved, but that isn't to say it is SAFE from being bagged on.
Personally; I found the story to be engaging, and the gameplay was entertaining enough that I was coming back to finish the story and see what other choices meant for how the game played.

However; the expressions & lip syncing are... well; absolutely horrendous. the ME Trilogy from my experience definitely didn't have perfect Expressions, but there was at least some emotion in those games.
Andromeda had my custom character looking like he ate an entire Pantry full of edibles - he genuinely looked so damn stoned in cut-scenes & conversations. In a lot of moments; this was just funny, but for the most part; this was just plain sad.
The other gripe I have with the game is the Apex Missions - god all mighty, these SUCK. They take ages to complete, you don't get a whole lot out of them, and it takes so long just to earn enough points to unlock decent upgrades for your Teams. I would play them out myself in MP, but obviously with how bad they are, no one else is playing, so can't ever find a game to get them going.

TBH i think the story of ME andromeda is FINE?! I played this without any expectation. I saw a lot of reviews from friends and strangers writing how trash the story was, if you compare with ME1-ME-ME3...and that is TRUE. 
YET in my opinion its the lack of consequences which doesnt alter the ending, as this game only has one ENDING....so... kind of pointless choices without consequences... So i would give a solid 7/8 for the game if my biggest complain was the story....[Story totally wins over starfield and some other aaa rpgs as of late...so yeah thats why i said its ""FINE""]

[h1] CONS [/h1]
- Sponge enemies which artificially increases game time
- A lot of walking around with literally nothing to do just to increase game time(travel path to quests)
- You cant skip space travels and some repeated cutscenes over and over again
- YOU CANT CHANGE  YOUR EQUIPMENT ON THE GO YOU NEED TO END THE MISSION OR GO TO A SPECIFIC SPOT FOR THAT....I WAS BEYOND PISSED WITH THIS FEATURE, FEATURE NO, COCKBLOCK, KILLER OF QUALITY OF LIFE. MF *THOUSANDS OF SWEARS FOR WHOEVER DESIGNED THAT*
-I SAW A LOT OF SAME NPC MODDELS REUSED OVER AND OVER AGAIN, SOME ARE EVEN IMPORTANT NPCS IN THE GAME...BRUHHHHHH|
- QUALITY OF LIFE IN THIS GAME WAS DONE IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY, COMBAT, UI, MENUS, STRIKE TEAM, AND SO ON, IT`S  DEF THE WORST GAME I PLAYED IN THIS CRITERIA, AND GUESS WHAT, BIOWARE MADE BETTER GAMES IN THIS REGARD AND BEING OLDER GAMES IT WAS ****************
- ROMANCE IN THIS GAME FELT BARE, WITHOUT JOY, THE DIALOGUES WERE THERE, BUT THE CUTSCENES WERE BAD AF, THE BEST WAY I COULD DESCRIBE IT FELT LIKE ""PAYING FOR A PERSON AND GETTING A DOLL"" xD ME 2-3 HAD SO MUCH BETTER LOVE  SCENES, AND I WAS LOOKING FORWARD FOR MY TURIAN TALL GF NGL(VETRA).

[h1] PROS [/h1] 
- I think its safe to say, Jaal is the best companion to have conversations, hes both bright, brave, smart, a real definition to ""indomitable `Angara` spirit""
- Drack, this Krogan Old bones is a really good squadmate and never left my party. Most useful companion for an insanity run, as far i'm concerned  for krogan party members , this one was a really good one which was worth of Wrex legacy.
-Vetra...i like the fact we could Date this Turian as a Male Pathfinder, an option we lacked in the previous titles as Shepard, the romance, quest and so on, are actually great. The email you receive in updates are sweet kind of, but the cutscenes i had complains. Gameplay, using Vetra's Eletro Ammo with Drack's Fire Ammo, you can prime and cook a lot of targets, made some of bosses easy af, specially architects with this gang was without problems.

Story is meh. You can skip all the dialogue by pressing the space button and you will feel better than listening to all this boring crap. The first 2-5 hours of the story are like a completely different game... For example, in the first hours you have many questions and dialogue and when you are about to meet the Angara, boom they know you are a human and ""yes please do this and that"". No questions about intentions, no building the relationship nothing... Get this, do this. The story spends too much time to pass you unnecessary info and in the important things it does not even try to build it. 

Soundtrack ? some good tracks but nothing memorable...

Gameplay ? The only good thing...

Open world ? Boring... 

PS: avoid augmenting your weapon with beaming shit. It does not work and you will spend materials for a weapon that will do 0 dmg to shields and armor... 1.10 update and it still crap.

The plot and characters in the story is just weak which sucks. It doesn;t feel like there's any heavy weighted decisions in this game either.  I remember feeling so immersed in the original Mass Effect games with planets like Illum and Omega and Noveria and you can definitely feel the absence of environments like that in this game.

They really needed to streamline this by
a) Focusing on more linear areas and not open world
b) Cutting out the uninteresting side mission content and focusing on the actually well-developed stories and missions
c) Reduce the amount of travel you need to do between planets. Especially the amount of times you leave a planet and then immediately get a new quest telling you to go back on the planet.

The combat in this game is even more fun than the original trilogy, allowing you to be able to navigate and explore open worlds instead of the lanes that were put upon you in ME1-3. It also adds verticality to your movements. Just another dimension of play that contributes so much to each battle. Each conflict you enter into is never the exact same and you have a variety of ways to engage thanks to a multitude of combat profiles.

The graphics are beautiful, and the worlds feel vast. The facial animations do not seem to land though, as your face and that of the individuals you encounter can be eyerollingly bad. If anything the facial animations on the non-humanoid players are excellent and their subtle gestures adds to an otherwise mediocre performance. The cast of characters are interesting, but don't seem to connect as well as teams in other entries in the franchise. However, it was nice to really connect with everyone on your ship including your pilot, your scientist, your doctor and your chief engineer. It felt like I had more team-mates than just those I adventured with. 

The landscapes while beautiful were a bit bland after seeing the same thing over and over again. It would be interesting having a whole world like in no mans sky to navigate and I would have loved to see the outposts that you set up grow as you progressed through the missions of the game. The worlds which you would navigate in the Nomad would eventually start to feel small, and there were numerous fetch quests that could become a bit tedious. 

The main story while fun and imaginative felt like it went by a little quickly if you just followed the main missions. It also didn't feel like choices mattered or added up to much in this game. The villain, while underwhelming themselves, the faction they represent felt threatening and overwhelming at times, but lacked the ominousness of the reapers. If anything the scourge felt like the real threat to the galaxy as it seemed to loom everywhere and not much was known about it.

While it wasn't the strongest entry in the series, it is definitely an excellent game and has had too much hate levied upon it for what it was. Even ME3 felt disappointing and unfinished as the game left you with so many questions.

If you just finished the Mass Effect trilogy and are expecting to continue the Mass Effect experience, you'll be disappointed by this title. This is essentially a brand new game that uses the same species as the originals. It lacks the charm of the original titles. For starters, the overall tone is much lighter than before and feels out of place. The humor is very.. ""he's right behind me, isn't he?"" The interactions (and character animations) feel stiff and lifeless. The plot felt very anti-climatic to me, and fell flat at the end. It was pretty annoying to feel disliked as the main character throughout the entire game. A lot of NPCs straight up say ""Fuck you"" during interactions. The main character doesn't have a chance to react, so you just have to take it like a chump. Maybe this is nit-picking but a lot of the hair styles and outfits are constantly reused, which makes the game looked rushed and ruins immersion.
As for the pros, it's still a decent game by itself, not considering the originals. The story's premise is still interesting: exploring and finding a new home for everyone in a new galaxy. The combat felt pretty cool, with an emphasis on constantly moving. It's fun to be able to switch between the different classes. Exploration was fun. There were few enjoyable characters, but when you find them, they're great. It's fun being able to pick different dialog options and make big choices that affect the species. The scanning mechanic is fun for the first ten hours. If you're a Mass Effect fan, I recommend this game despite it's disconnect from the originals. Just don't go into it expecting it to be related to the originals. This game is like it's distant cousin.",1707790646,1707790646,True,5,1,0.574860274791717529,0,True,False,False

Open world is an understatement, a great game gives the player true freedom of choice as much as possible, and this game is true open world imho.

The dialog is for adults, which I appreciate.  I can choose statements based on my true opinions and they tend play out as I would expect, for the most part.  I miss ME2's paragon/renegade choices vs just an occasional action-option, but that's a personal opinion, not a fact.

The graphics are incredible, no complaints with a custom top end PC.  Having played this on PS4, I can say its much more smooth and pretty on a physically updated PC.

Story is very original and in depth.  If you like knowing every little detail:  this is your game.  There are parts I know by heart I tend to skip through, but every time I play I find a new datapad or terminal or quest I hadn't found the previous time.

The cons I can give are the before-mentioned gameplay issues and crashes.  New install on new top line PC that plays dozens of games without issues.  ME3 has the bad habit of missing with targeting.  If you are looking near an enemy its health might display, might not, depending on the game's mood.  Using an ability while focusing on a target doesn't guarantee a hit.  Enemies have a bad habit of living despite having literally no health and continuing their attack, and their accuracy is always perfect no matter what is happening.  I enjoy a challenge, but the devs didn't even try to make combat realistic.

The game sometimes freezes and closes without warning or error while in loadout.  Select a weapon mod, do whatever, and then cancel out, and when the screen should show your weapons, it doesn't, and then the game closes.  It happens about 50% of the time so I have a habit of saving before changing gear mods. 
 Sometimes when you interact with an NPC the game will just stop, you can't do anything but close and re-load last save, again.  

Games might not have been as pretty back in the day, but at least you didn't have to quit and start over because of design flaws.  I can't believe they're still trying to sell this game without one patch to fix these crashing issues.

Through Mass Effects 1-3 felt the games kept getting better, more gripping, more enjoyable. The finale of 3 was satisfying; I did what made sense, shot the hell out of the entity driving the Reapers, and felt thoroughly satisfied by the end, regardless of what everyone else seemed to think about the end(s). I went straight from that into Andromeda. About 15 hours in, I'm sadly thinking of giving up. What went wrong? You can probably find multiple accounts of the problems during development on YouTube, but here's mine:

The Pros: 
a) Better movement! The jump jet pack is a nice addition. Ryder is more acrobatic than Shepard as well. 
b) Building outposts is a great idea in theory. Making a savage world hospitable? Sign me up! That's really the heart of adventure as far as I'm concerned. 
c) It's nice to have more conversation between party members....for a while at least.....
d) They moved special skills to active buttons that can be directly employed in combat. So rather than using the wheel and pausing combat, you can deliver these skills without interrupting the flow of what's going on. 

The Cons:
a) Changing the controls. This is more my failure to adapt than anything, but it bears comment. In 2 & 3 you used ""A"" to take cover, but now ""A"" is the jump jet, and there's about half a dozen times in combat when I've tried to dive for cover and ended up shooting up into the air from behind cover like a goddamn clay pigeon, giving the enemy an opportunity to practice their skeet shooting skills. Also, in combat I go for my weapon wheel (left bumper), well, now that's the special skills, so instead of choosing my weapons I end up using one of those skills instead. (These probably won't be a problem for someone younger or more adaptable, so feel free to dismiss it as the incoherent boomering that it is.)
b) All right, which of you assholes brought back the Mako from Mass Effect 1? Seriously, that was the WORST part of ME1. Such a misleading name. The mako shark is a fast-moving, highly agile animal that uses its speed and strength to take down all kinds of prey. Conversely, the Mako handled like a walrus under the influence of two bottles of red wine and a full stuffed crust pizza and was armored with cardboard boxes and oily rags. I know it's called the ""Nomad"" now but it's still a six-wheeling, poor-handling piece of crap that gets stuck on rocks, and this time, it doesn't even have a gun. What the hell was wrong with the Hammerhead? It FLOATED. Why would you abandon a freaking hovercraft for a measly truck, especially in a set of environments featuring an abundance of axle-snapping rocks? Also, why doesn't a futuristic space truck built for every possible hostile environment have a decent heater in it? Is this a highly engineered extraterrestrial military vehicle or a 1994 Toyota Corolla?
c) The dialogue is quippy adolescent Buffyverse patter that's very dated (Marvel kind of drove that into the ground) and not as funny as they seem to think. Shepard was always a laconic, straightforward guy, not up for saying the cutesy thing, but always getting to the point. Ryder comes across as a young, trying-to-be-hip middle manager who wants to be your pal.  And as much as a little conversation between party members is nice, there's a little TOO much now. Driving across the mostly featureless plains of Voeld listening to Cora and Liam quip at each other every 90 seconds or so just made me think, ""Great, I have to do a road trip with THESE guys...."" Never felt that way about Garrus or Liara. 
d) And speaking of featureless plains, the idea of putting Mass Effect in an open world sounded great on the surface, just not THESE open worlds. Eos and Voeld are pretty featureless deserts/glacier worlds so far (maybe they get better when the vaults open up). They are pretty but pretty empty. 
e) Weapons feel less impactful than before, especially the melee. That omni blade strike that felt massive as hell in 3? Gone, nerfed, even if it's still useful. 
f) Bugs. I bought this in 2023, five years after it was released so there's no excuse for the audio dropping out all together or there being enemy markers hanging around after all the enemies are dead. My understanding is that they stopped trying to fix it soon after release, and it shows. The meme-able facial expressions seem to have been corrected, but they're still not great. 
g) Goal markers vanish as you approach them, leaving you with some kind of sonar game to play when trying to find something specific. There's no defensible reason for doing this besides padding the run-time. Irritating. 
h) If you get too close to an object or a person, you can't interact with them and have to back up to find the right ""zone"". Even if there's a button prompt on screen, you often can't get it to work unless you're in the right invisible spot. Fr'example, Y is both the ""get in Nomad"" and the melee weapon button, and I can't tell you how many times I've tried to get into the Nomad and ending up emitting an out-of-nowhere scream and stabbing it mercilessly, while my party members are no doubt slowly backing away and dialing 911.  
i) The scanner sucks. Whenever you have to do some scanning for some nonspecific item you have to pull the damn thing out and walk around very SLOOOOOWLY until you happen on whatever Verra-be-damned random piece of garbage that the Remnant wrote their Verra-be-damned glyph on. This is just SUPER fun to do on Voeld, where you get to walk around slowly while your life support drains, and when it does, you have to go sit in the only-slightly warmer Mak....Normad for way, way too long and start up again. Very irritating. 
j) Along those same lines, the monoliths are just dreary. I've only dealt them on Eos/Voeld but even with that limited experience I find my heart sinking into my boots when a monolith shows up on screen. All the Mass Effect hacking minigames were kind of dumb, but not Play-Sudoku-With-Alien-Glyphs kind of dumb. I suppose I should be thankful they didn't have you play Wordle instread. 
k) Are we down  to K already? Good lord. The voice acting is not good. Almost everyone involved seems at least two steps away from seeming, well, involved. The lack of Keith David alone brings this down a couple of notches. I don't care what he's asking for, pay the man. 
l) I miss Garrus. 
m) I miss Liara. 
n) I don't miss Kaden. That's not a specific complaint but I wanted to say it loud so that everyone understands he's no son of mine. 

(I'm kidding, He's fine, just kind of vanilla.)
o) There's too many new systems - things I'm not using because I'm too busy, you know, playing the game. I haven't touched the so-called multiplayer because Mass Effect has always been about taking a break from the scourge of other people and not hanging out with packs of snotty kids and failed-to-launch semi-adults slinging racial slurs at each other. There's also some kind of random skin-strengthening thing that you can ramp up? IDK. It showed up at some point towards the beginning, when they hitting me with an avalanche of game system stuff in between exposition dumps. 
p) The Kett are bullet sponges. Miss the days when you could line up a good old fashion headshot and take out an enemy; now it just takes away a quarter of their health and they stagger a bit. You get pretty much the same effect from a headshot as you do shooting them in the foot. 
q) The Angara are jerks.
r) The interface is just a mess. The screen is cluttered, but I particularly detest it on Voeld when the interface tells me the temperature is dropping and then half a second later SAM tells me the EXACT SAME THING verbally in that Speak-N-Spell-On-Kratom voice of his. YOU JUST TOLD ME THAT, GAME. I KNOW.   

Please put this excellent IP back in the hands of the studio that made it great. I really, really hope they can right the ship with the next iteration of this game I've grown to love.

The ugly...Make sure you keep track of certain quests because they don't always show a tracking spot for them.  There might be a mod for that, but I prefer to play without mods.  The best recommendation I have is to take picture of the planet's quests before heading to it's landing zone.

But I cannot refrain from posting my first impressions because I am quite disappointed. The game is beautiful and the gameplay is quite nice but it's so far below the first trilogy in terms of story. I have the same bitter taste as for DA Inquisition, because the story has the same flaws. 
The situations are unrealistic and totally artificial because of poor dialogues and unconsistant situations. Like you the ""pathfinder"" who is suposed to explore and open the way for all the settlers to come but you find a world that already populated with the same species than in the milkyway. There is a Krogan city, a human city. ect 
That makes no sense. 

This laziness in the way of developping the plot that leads to the most grotesque situations: Like when the first contact with a new civilization is wrapped up in three lines before the aliens deliver you fedex quests as if you were their mailman since ever hello MMO style. It's so  tacky...

Wondering what Bioware has lost ? Their ability to deliver a good story because this is really poor.

Almost done and it's more of the same. Fedex quests everywhere, redondant puzzles and remnant pylon missions that are so boring. The plot has no flavour.

The negative aspects you're probably already heard of are certainly there, but so are good parts I feel get unfairly overlooked. Frankly, it's too big for it's own good. It's easy to get bogged down in the more boring aspects - especially if, like me you're in the unfortunate habit of not saying no to NPCs..... but playing the main storyline and loyalty missions, I ended up having a good time.

Perhaps it helps that I came to it with lowered expectations, but I found the plot to be better than I expected. It was always unlikely to be quite as good as the trilogy, just because a bunch of the best ideas have already been used by that point. As with most things about this game, it's a little inconsistent, but there are interesting concepts and impactful moments here, certainly moreso than I had been led to believe by the general discussion around this game.

A seemingly unpopular opinion: I like the Remnant stuff. It's very much distinct from the Prothean tech in the trilogy (an initial concern of mine) and I found the puzzles to be a nice change from the rest of the gameplay.

The characters were something I really liked about the trilogy, and my initial impressions (and expectation generally) was that I was going to be let down by Andromeda.....then, a little while later I realised I was wrong. The characters are fine, we just got off on the wrong foot, y'know? Hearing squadmates talk to each other was certainly the highlight of driving the Nomad around. There are loyalty missions, as with ME2, and in some ways I actually prefer the implementation in Andromeda. A little more organic, where ME2 feels kinda locked in.

Overall, It's not as good as the trilogy, and the general tone of it is quite different as well. But, with expectations set accordingly, I think it's worth playing, especially if you pick it up on sale.

If you're new to the ME franchise, play the original trilogy first. That being said, I think it's worth it to give it a chance, especially if you get it on sale.

Combat takes getting used to if you played the original trilogy, but it is fun. Though I miss the HUD screen/power wheel and using powers while pausing and managing squadmates, I hope that will make a return in future games. I'm more of a singleplayer guy and rarely play multiplayer, but MP is a lot of fun too. Planet exploration is nice, but it could be worked on and made more interesting.
There's still a few bugs that are annoying, but I didn't experience anything major. Dialogue is a bit weird sometimes and facial animations could be better too. Most characters aren't as captivating, but there are some nice character arcs. A lot of smaller side missions are just collection quests or talking to someone and it's a lot of back and forth between locations which gets very tedious. To be fair, you can just ignore most of them with no impact to the story, but it just doesn't add anything and is pretty boring. I'd prefer quality over quantity for side missions. The main story was intriguing at the start, average in-between with a decent ending, but it's just forgettable. In a way there's a lot of similarities to the trilogy's plot if you think about it, which I find very uninspired, but on top it's also not executed well. The writing and story just doesn't feel like Mass Effect and there's zero impactful decisions, which doesn't do the franchise justice. Also the removal of the paragon/renegade system is a huge shame. I feel like that's one of the core aspect of a Mass Effect game and for it to be missing is a very questionable choice. In my opinion the story would've been better if [spoiler]the kett weren't a thing and we just had the mystery of the remnant and the environmental challenges to deal with, though I imagine most people would expect a Mass Effect game to have some major threat. I personally think a game set in the Mass Effect universe could be incredible without trying to recreate the plot aspects of the original games.[/spoiler] 

Overall Andromeda is an okay game, it does some things pretty well but other things not so much. If you're a Mass Effect fan, it's worth giving it a try, just don't expect too much.",1680881070,1706278677,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Just like the firs Mass Effect, Andromeda really focuses on exploration. While there are less planets to visit; the size of most of them are drastically bigger and much more detailed. Each one has various side-missions scattered around to keep you busy as well.

The story also feels similar to the first game too. It's very close in (for a lack of better terms) scope and scale. I don't think it's as good but it's still solid. While this might be a bit of a controversial opinion, playing as a brand new character is nice. I'm not saying i don't want Shepard's story to continue (I really, really do.), I just think a spin-off in the Mass Effect universe is a great idea..

Combat and movement in this game is by far the best in the series. Being able to jump beyond just hopping over waist-high cover is so nice. I think the best bit is that silky-smooth cover system. Again similar to the first Mass Effect, it's auto-cover. So you just walk up to a wall, rock, ledge, etc. and you'll just take cover. It's way better implemented in Andromeda too..

Now for the negatives... A decent amount of the side-quest just feel like filler and are pretty boring. Some even have you hop from planet to planet which can take a while. I don't like how ammo types are consumables now either, halfway through I just stopped using them altogether.

There's also a decent amount of bugs. One of them was so bad I had to turn a bunch of lights and and turn down the brightness on my monitor so my eyes would stop hurting. During a pretty long section of one of the story missions, the screen would be flashing large white boxes on my screen really quickly. Even after re-launching the game the glitch was still there.

My biggest complaint though is those doors on Kadara, WHY DO THEY TAKE SO LONG TO OPEN!?!

Overall I'd say this is a great addition to the franchise(?), and I think if people looked passed those now (mostly?) fixed launch bugs and treated it like a spin-off, they'd probably enjoy it.",1704952233,1706211731,True,8,0,0.5823516845703125,0,True,False,False

While the game faced its share of initial criticisms, it ultimately stands as a testament to the immense world-building, engaging storytelling, and captivating gameplay that Mass Effect fans have come to love.

One of Andromeda's strongest aspects is its vast and visually stunning open world. From the lush landscapes of alien planets to the intricate details of futuristic space stations, the game's environments are a testament to the developers' dedication to creating a rich and immersive universe. The sense of exploration is heightened by the Nomad, a versatile vehicle that allows players to traverse diverse terrains and discover hidden gems scattered across the galaxy.

The narrative, though different from the original trilogy, introduces a fresh and intriguing storyline. As the Pathfinder, players assume the role of Ryder, a character with a compelling journey of leadership, discovery, and diplomacy. The dynamic relationships with the diverse crew members add emotional depth to the narrative, allowing players to connect with the characters on a personal level.

The combat mechanics in Andromeda are a notable improvement, offering a more fluid and dynamic experience. The addition of jump jets introduces a vertical element to battles, making encounters with hostile alien species both strategic and exhilarating. The variety of weapons and abilities at your disposal allows for diverse playstyles, keeping combat engaging throughout the game.

Andromeda's character customization system is another standout feature. From the appearance of your Ryder twin to the skillset and abilities, the game provides a level of personalization that enhances the role-playing aspect. Choices made throughout the game impact the narrative, creating a sense of agency and consequence that adds replay value.

Despite its early criticisms, many of the technical issues that plagued Andromeda at launch have been addressed through patches and updates. The commitment of the development team to refine and improve the game post-release demonstrates a dedication to delivering a polished experience for players.

In conclusion, Mass Effect: Andromeda may have faced a rocky start, but beneath the surface lies a space epic filled with exploration, memorable characters, and a galaxy full of untold stories. For fans of the Mass Effect universe and newcomers alike, Andromeda offers a captivating adventure that shouldn't be missed.

Pros:
The action part of it is solid as well as 6 wheel vehicle is fun to drive. Majority of time will be spent in those two so that is a plus. There is a nice camera work and visuals when we space travel. I have to say I relay enjoy that one. Especially hooping within a solar system. Graphics is solid as well. We have multiple planets with unique visuals.

Cons.
Story. You know when you are pulled in by it. I did not really have it here. SPOILER ALERT: There is a only one new alien that can join your theme and two new species in this new galaxy :(. Graphics glitches a lot for released game. Lot's of texture popping on terrain.In some places random, weird artifacts. And last but not least facial animations. What can I say.

It's not as good as the original trilogy, of course. The art direction is really good, the combat is tighter and more fun than the original trilogy. And it was worth the time I spent playing it, I had fun. (also helps that I bought it on sale for <$10).

The overall plot is disappointing, however. Unlike the original games, I didn't get the feeling I was working towards something meaningful. There wasn't the same sense of narrative velocity as the originals, I was just kinda fiddling around on planets. Mass Effect 1 & 3 in particular really made me feel an excitement to see what happens next in the overall plot, there was a forward momentum that's lacking here.

That momentum isn't necessary for a great game. I love Mass Effect 2, but that's because the characters were so well drawn. Andromeda's characters just aren't that interesting by comparison. I thought the voice acting in Andromeda was well done (I played Sara Ryder), but the writing generally wasn't, and I didn't get attached to the characters in the same way. There were some great moments in the writing here and there, and I was entertained by the banter between squadmates while exploring, but the characters ended up feeling a bit generic. The writing in Andromeda isn't bad per se, it's just...boring.

I loved the combat, and I found  the game prettier to look at than the original trilogy. The world felt like Mass Effect, it had the right vibe. But boring missions and plot and generic characters make this a disappointing entry compared to the original trilogy. Still fun though, I'd give it 7/10.

It's so bad it's makes you laugh. Never have I asked myself ""You're joking"" and followed by ""No, I guess you're not"".
In summary - the game knows that it's terrible and it reminds you of it every minute, it uses every tool it has to make you spend as much time as possible on it by prolonging your torture.
The only good thing about the game are the graphics (I saw videos with facial expression issues in early releases, in 2024 it's all fixed.
Quests look like this: ""Quick! Gotta go to the opposite side of the galaxy! Oh no! We have to go back! Oh no! It was a trick! Let's go to a tavern on another planet! Oh no!, we need to go through 5 loading screens to get to it! Oh no!, the guys not there! Quick, solve 3 puzzles that are exactly the same as the 573 you've solved before and always jsut as annoying because there's no skill involved! Hooray! You did it! Now you can listen to NPCs talk about what a loser you are (while specifically referencing the annoying puzzles or your running there and back) And guess what, you get to unfreeze people from hypersleep (which means you get a flat 2% bonus to prices in shops or sth and no story implications whatsoever).""
If it sounds bad, oh boooy, you have no idea how much worse it is. 
Sometimes I had thoughts like - ""Oooh, this story would be fit so much better in sth like Mass Effect... Oh wait... :( ""
The armor design is nice. But somehow it's annoying to research and make.
Jumping and dashing is one of my favourite things. Until I started abusing it for getting from one loading screen to the next ASAP.
The new aliens are not surprised at all you came from the milky way, kind of see you as a loser who needs to be taught how to live. Even though you do EVERYTHING better than them.  It's like the witers somehow forgot that they're writing a game where YOU are supposed to be the scary alien in another galaxy.
This was my second attempt at playing it. The first time I quit after arriving at the first Alien planet, I couldn't take it. This time I thought, OK, let's do it. Until I ended up spending the whole day o doing slider puzzles in Elaaden to terrafrom the planet (planets actually don't change at all after you do it - And NPCs know it, and make sure you know they know).

At first I didn't like all the little changes, but once I got used to them I realized the core Mass Effect vibe is still there.  The story lines are maybe a bit less interesting, you are not trying to save the Universe. You are more like the appointed head of a giant expedition to find a new home everyone. So you g from protecting everyone's home to trying to find a new home for everyone. Little less action, bit more politics, lots of exploring. The game world is top notch, I took many screen shots. Plays smooth, looks great. However. I'm not a big fan of the weapons, and the changes to the use of skill points and upgrades and such. None of the weapons seem to have any real stopping power to them regardless of upgrades. So expect to shoot a lot and make use of cover more often than usual. All in all I feel like they softened the game up, almost as if everyone is battle weary and it was time to relax and explore new options. 

A good game though. Enjoying my play through. Would recommend to those who enjoy Sci-fi and somewhat  immersive plot lines. Likely not the best choice for those seeking to just shoot aliens.  But if you enjoy a good single player story, this is a good one. You don't even need to play the other two games first, though it might help immersion to read up what the other two games cover.",1705162970,1705162970,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

First things first, it is NOT the original trilogy. It is a game set in the same universe, 680 years in the future in a different galaxy. Things are different. You play not a warrior but an explorer.

This is what got me into it, I've done the action thing, lets see what else this universe can bring us. Liara and Femshep will always have my heart but this is NOT that game. A lot of people don't seem to understand that.

This game is a beautiful example of world building. Or should I say Universe building. I was fascinated by the exploration of an entire new galaxy, and that nobody even knows what happened with the reapers is a great way to keep it canonical. 

The game play is fast and you often don't feel like a you're old spectre bad ass, but i like that, there are so many mysteries to uncover from the literal opening moments. 

The worlds are stunning and the crafting and upgrades are fun as hell, not to mention the apex missions to add little strategic twists now and then. I feel like every character you speak to has either a mission or something so interesting to say, adding to the lore.

In short. I'm sad that gamers have become entitled pricks who don't want anything to change, change is good people, or just go play fortnight for the rest of your adult life. And because of those gamers we'll never know what could have been in the Andromeda trilogy.

I mean the most popular AAA games today are literal remakes of fantastic older games. WE HATE CHANGE,

My hope is that one day people realise how multiplayer has destroyed good games, I mean the game Bioware did after this was Anthem, trying to hop on the multiplayer game as a service shit. And they imploded.

Give new things a chance fellow gamers, and stop listening or caring what you tube and your friends say.

Nothing online or offline encouraged me to give Mass Effect Andromeda a chance. Directly the opposite, in fact. Overwhelmingly negative, from the disappointed fans to the undying memes. 

I am so glad I gave it a chance. What a hidden gem. An unpolished gem quickly abandoned by its shaper, but a gem all the same. It is now easily my preferred sequel to Mass Effect 1 and might even be my favorite experience of the Mass Effect universe overall. The main missions range from very good to very good plus extremely satisfying on a spiritual level. The changes to the dialogue wheel and related personality system work for me. The combat took a moment to adjust to but quickly became exciting and fun (PSA: tech combos OP). I always see open worlds in terms of negatives, but I love open worlds? And they're gorgeous in MEA. Also very refreshing after how constrained the maps were in ME2 and (less so) ME3. Proper ground transport is back, and Mako weapons have been traded in exchange for some excellent party banter. Crafting is a little convoluted but ultimately fun and useful. Instead of punching a pyjak, you get to adopt one. The cutest grown-up gremlin in the Heleus Cluster hates you and wants your Siri; sadly there is no flirt option with him, but you can flirt with a krogan daddy, and, honestly, that should really be all anyone has to say about MEA. 

One of the biggest changes from the original trilogy is that the game has no Paragon/Renegade, which meant you can't be as forceful or abrasive as Shepard could be. However, it also means there is no automatic obvious golden outcome to missions great and small. You can't speech check your way through social and political relationships; you have to roleplay your best option given the context and how you are playing your Ryder. This was very welcome in major moments and character interactions but also happened in a surprising amount of minor quests. As a result, my Ryder's experience of the social, political, and cultural dynamics of MEA could feel as risky and as free as combat encounters. At the same time, the game tracks Ryder's personality trends, so there is a nice balance of giving you the freedom to choose dialogue as you go, while also (subtly) having Ryder and other characters pay notice to which trends you most often pick. Enhancing this experience are the relationships you can build with various NPCs and the crew, which include, imo, some of the best companions in the franchise with loyalty missions that veer from enjoyable romps to quieter journeys of finding one's place. Sometimes both. There are NPCs that can charm and surprise you, like Rorik the krogan (I won't spoil why; just meet him and you will understand). Mass Effect Andromeda has space and time for a lot of voices, and it's the kind of experience that can exhaust you if you don't like open worlds. That's fair. For me, it is refreshing and enthralling; as soon as I finished the game, I wanted to go right back in and experience it again with a new Ryder with a different personality making different choices. And I also just... want to see it all again. It's a treat.

There is a magic about the first Mass Effect game's endgame sequence that no other Mass Effect game has surpassed. Nothing beats meeting Sovereign and talking with Vigil in ME1. I still get emotional when I enter the Archives in Ilos, knowing what is coming up; it's a moment that gives me goosebumps every time for every Shepard. Mass Effect 1 is one of my favorite games of all time and will always be. But I also can't deny that Ryder and his crew (and this game itself, despite all memes and mockery to the contrary) were the little engine that could; they bested their circumstances in-game and out, and their journey won me over completely. The hero's journey is not an unusual one in RPGs, but it's a journey I quite enjoyed in the Mass Effect setting, with all its layers of care and nuance and attention that are clearly evident despite MEA's troubled production. It's almost because of all the negative noise surrounding MEA that the in-game journey felt more impactful and bittersweet. After the end, when I saw my Ryder smile a little as he looked over at his companions, I was full of pride and affection; I didn't want to say goodbye.

I liked how the game started. Very atmospheric and intriguing.
It's only when you get the wheels that the game shows the first signs of lazy open-world game design. Almost all tasks are of the type: go to X locations, collect X things, scan X minerals. Unimaginative fillers just stretch out the game time, which does not affect the plot in any way. At the same time, almost all of them break the immersion because they force the player on an important mission to engage in some petty nonsense.
[i]Of course Samir, I will scan the electrical panels for you. We urgently need to make a colony, but I will do your work for you.[/i]

I'm on the fourth planet and I'm already sick of the game. Everything is the same, just painted a different color. Even combat, which feels good, gets boring. 

There is no roleplaying in the game. In the original ME there was a choice between a paragon and a renegade. It helped the player connect with the protagonist. Yes, sometimes the results were over the top. But it was the player's choice and that's what makes it fun, even if it did not have a strong impact on the final goal.

In this game, you choose between a funny paragon and a serious paragon. Ryder periodically gets insulted, but progressive developers do not allow Ryder to at least answer with a threat. NPC doesn't respect Rider, his crewmates don't respect him. Why should I care about him? Kadara has completely broken my will to play this game. At this point, I simply hate everyone in this game. The main character is a pushover.
The lack of character-building in this game is disappointing.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3136452947
I have nothing to say about the support characters. They are all not interesting and obnoxious. They don't want to respect Rider's authority as a captain of the ship, so I didn't bother to talk to them and do their loyalty missions.
If you replace all aliens with humans, nothing will change. I would trade them all for Javik and Garus.

Cant bring myself to even finish the main quest, For that I need to complete secondary missions, and I’m tired of looking at what a toxic positive loser the main character is.

The same goes for the main plot. Boring ""go there, do that"" type of story.

A game without choices. In the sterile and tolerant world of Andromeda, you are only allowed to make the right choices, otherwise you will get nothing. For example, during a story quest you meet a lying AI. If you kill it or take it with you, then there will be no help in the final mission. The same thing happens if you blow up the factory. If the choice is between 0 and 1, then there is no choice.

Profiles. They are annoying because when switching you have to wait for the cooldown of your skills. I have a huge amount of skill points, which I simply didn’t know what to spend on.  Rarely use profiles because the cooldown and most skills are not interesting. I maxed out my main 3 skills that I used almost all the time.

Crafting and Research, are useless nonsense. I made 1 assault rifle and 1 set of armor, which I have been using since the beginning of the game, only changing to a better version. The rest of the weapons are too different for my taste or my speciality and I have no desire to use them. Also, there are too many ingredients in the game to keep track of them all.

Mods for weapons, useless garbage that clutters up your inventory. But you need to keep them because you need to insert them into armor and weapons to make them better. You never know what modification may be needed.

Missions with mercenary squads are taken directly from predatory free games for mobile phones. Log in every couple of RL hours to receive a tiny reward and assign new missions that do not affect anything.
The same goes for the resources you get when unlocking cryopods. You need to log in every hour/half hour to collect your reward. And the reward does not accumulate.

The interface is simply terrible. There is no inventory sorting, all items are shown in a column, quests are separated by folders. But there are categories where all items are sorted in folders like quests, which is also not convenient. Perhaps this is the main reason why I don’t want to use crafting.

No quick saves. If you save through the menu, then to load, you need to exit the game, since the loading option is only available in the main menu, and from the menu in the game, you can only exit to the desktop.

I don’t know what kind of fool thought that solving Sudoku would be fun. All these Remnant puzzles are just annoying.

Bottom line: The game is terrible. A soulless corporate shell made to capitalize on modern social trends.",1673117995,1704974446,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story was good in my opinion, a few times I felt it was incomplete or rushed, but it was a pleasure to play through. There is a strong sense that the game is being developed for a sequel.

Original mass effects feel like star wars where the atmospheres feel epic, war, earth invasion and played as Shepard, a charismatic military person. On other hand Andromeda feels like star trek where the game focus on exploration, finding clue and occasional combat, also main character is a rookie. The epic experience different is significant.

Andromeda has improved graphic and combat, I would say these are the real improvement from previous mass effect. The combat feels better because mc can dash and jump which give more freedom to player to dodge and quicker movement, and a lot of weapons and armor selections. Overall graphic is improved compared with Mass effect 3, the environment and character look better. Infamous issue such as facial animation and funny walking seem to be patched, current facial animations look alright.

The main story is alright, not as great and epic as original Mass effect but it does the job. The squad relations are quite memorable.

The sound is just ok.

Now the things that I dislike in andromeda are too many boring missions. Many missions that feel like chores and repetitive, most are side missions but since I am quite a completionist and curious, I did a lot of them. These boring missions drag down a lot of my interest on andromeda, I often feel pushing myself to continue this game. Although the final battle feels quite epic, my overall experience of andromeda is not as epic as original mass effects (especially mass effect 2). Another thing that I miss is paragon/renegade decision, most of the time there is no wrong or very different decision in andromeda.

Regarding technical issues, I experienced several minor bug or glitch such as mouse button not working momentarily on menu, and black screen in few combat which happen on certain camera angle, no game breaker so far.

In conclusion, Andromeda is an ok game, definitely not bad and also not great. Maybe score around 7.5",1632663770,1704603193,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Ui is a mess, open your map and you have to hit esc 3 times to get back to gameplay, every time. Navigating sub-menus trying to compare what you have, how many, what quests are on what planet as your on that planet, some quests dont have a set location for a marker so you just have to come across them anywhere on that planet, or remember to scan everything. 

Configuring load outs are swapping mods has its own issues. Frequently as you go to swap a weapon, it will select your previously hovered wep and make modifications to it, so you have to select the one you want, back all the way out go back in change the mod go back out then back in so it only loads that 1 gun, same with research and dev, it will research your previously selected choice so you have to read and re-read to make sure you aren't wasting your points.

No manual saves during most missions, and the checkpoints can sometimes be 3 areas behind where you were, going into a kett base and die at the top, sometimes takes you back to the beginning of that base, mobs often spawn behind a locked door you cant access until you kill all mobs or under the floor and can shoot you from there, and some of these can be full planet progress halting for completion, like the main Quest: ""Remove the Heart"". Some quests once you start you must finish all the way through otherwise the game doesnt like you back-tracking, however I physically cant as they are spawning behind the door and it wont let me open said door to get into the next room, leaving the planet doing other quests to 'reset' the planet didnt help. previous loads are several hours behind at this point, but w/e ill wait.
 
Load screen bugs, sometimes after dying or fast traveling your game will just be stuck at 100% for up to 15minutes, alt tabbing closing game and reloading a manual save then coming back, loading older autosaves all sometimes help in their own way but holy shit is it annoying.

Audio for the whole game sometimes cuts out or only 1 persons dialogue doesnt load, causing you to close the whole game, and if its during a part you cant manual save well just deal with it. 

AI is jank and will sometimes not charge into battle or will get themselves into the middle of all 10 mobs and die, targeting big mobs (like a mini boss) they will either just stand there or ping pong between running at the mob and running back to me. 

The game isnt hard, iv been playing on insanity and have only died a couple times, sometimes to the movement getting stuck on an item while im dashing, or my team mate blocking me from going around the corner, but having to redo large sections because of the checkpoint and hopeing the game doesnt get hard stuck for 15 minutes or after loading a door becoming inaccessible because a mob is stuck behind a wall is just way too much.

Steam has denied my rrefund because i put almost 20hrs into the game, but more than half of that time was spent dealing with reloads and reruns and loading screen wait times. And thats not even getting started on how bland the story or how uninteresting the dialogue can be most of the time, so generic.

massive amount of content, fun and challenge, and unique story.

there are a few downside, which does not matter, give yourself time and you get used to it. menu and UI has a bit bigger learning cure, unstuck yourself and take it easy, enjoy combat and slowly learn the huge content hidden in the small texted UI. don't try to learn all game mechanic in first 20 hours. give time, you will learn it.

made 2017 but runs way better than Star Field and even looks better. played 30 hours and find one bug, [spoiler] simply tried to re-enter the first Vault after finished its quest.[/spoiler]

story is really good, so far. I have not finished it but its really engaging.
I really like games that give you grind as an option, Andromeda does that with charming side quests.

I bough it with 80% discount but if i knew this game is so good, I would have paid full price in 2017.

The worst obvious mistake people do about this game is comparing it to ME sequel and event worse they expect the same story to continue here, Andromeda is another whole much prettier galaxy, its not Milky Way and I am so glad its not Milky Way =) if you really want to compare it to a game, compare it to Star Flied and you realize EA did something way back in time,that others still can not do in 2023.

This is a game set in the Mass Effect Universe. It is plagued with arbitrary wait times for things like resources you use to build armor and weapons and the writing is very simple, not a lot of depth in many of the characters either. World-building is set back, because in order to get two new alien races, they sacrificed all but 4 (Salarians, Turians, Asari, Krogan). The planets are remarkably similar to the planets in ME1, in that they're empty with a few notable exceptions. Colonization is just a story device, no effect on the plot at all except now you can go to X or Y area.  Gameplay is the only spot where this seems to be something of an improvement, not enough over ME3's refined cover shooting and combo systems to make it offset the flaws in this game. The emphasis on mobility like in ME1 is nice, new powers make cover shooting and run-and-gun styles equally valuable. Gun animations are interesting, rather than just smacking the Claymore to reload you open the gun and remove the clip like you would expect from a weapon. The verticality of the combat system is fun, but I need more than ""main character can jump now"" to make the game worth it.  The only thing that can make someone play it again are the mods that take away a lot of the stale atmosphere or janky gameplay, but since it's abandonware, lots of modders have stopped modding for the game, any updates pushed out will likely break all mods and make the game unplayable, see Bethesda for an example.  TL;DR: It's flawed, and cringe at times. Think of it as a game in the ME universe, not a ME game. Also, for the Love of God, use mods.",1704127422,1704127422,False,5,0,0.534846901893615723,0,True,False,False

I've dropped better (but still bad) games than this much sooner. Is it some twisted morbid curiosity to see how bad it is in its entirety? Or perhaps some masochistic tendencies that have been repressed until this farce of a ""role-playing-game"" made them surface? I don't know, I don't know whether I should laugh or cry.

First, let's kick the dead horse one more time - yes, the technical state of the game is pretty bad, even after patches. Frostbite is simply useless for any non-FPS game and even DICE has serious issues grappling with it (see BF2042) for an FPS game, and they are the ones for whom it was made in the first place. Frame drops, various issues with texture streaming and assets not loading, stiff and robotic animations, stuff like companions getting stuck inside walls, your vehicle de-spawning while you are driving it, and a lot more. I don't know what is worse - the fact that a Mass Effect game released in this state, or that this is pretty much the standard for AAA games from 2015 onwards.

Anyways, now we get to the actual main problem of the game - the writing is atrocious. It's on the level of shitty fanfiction written by a drunk pre-pubescent child after lobotomy. Quips, jokes and one-liners that would get rejected even by Marvel, inconsistencies and contradictions in story, characters and world-building, often ignoring or even outright contradicting the lore of the main games, huge plotholes, nonsensical narrative and quests, etc.

The IRL equivalent of the story would be tech bros building a sailing boat based on YT video manuals of suspect quality, then staffing it with the customer base of local Starbucks, none of whom have any sailing experience what so ever, then blindfolded all of them to make the experience more fun, and set sail during the storm season. Yes, it's exactly as bad as that sounds. Even the setup of the ""Andromeda Initiative"" is so r-tarded and raises so many questions to an average-IQ layman that the supposed ""specialists"" and ""engineers"" characters in the game must have all had fake CV's (just like the writers on this team), because I refuse to believe for one single f-cking moment that literally no-one would figure out that it would be good idea to [spoiler]wake up a bit early to check the f-cking galaxy is the same after 600 years travel to, I don't know, check if there was any alien presence, to check if all of the scanner reading were still good, and in turn avoiding ramming into some space phenomena that appeared during the SIX F-CKING CENTURIES DURING WHICH EVERYONE WAS ASLEEP AND THUS COULDN'T CHECK.[/spoiler] This is literally like flying a plane blindfolded - pilots aren't allowed to do it for a f-cking reason, and I am supposed to just accept it here? Nah, f-ck off Bioware. The story of this game is just pure nonsense. Was the original ME flawless? No, but it was a hundred times more believable. Most of the things tied together well enough, and the things happening were believable and consistent. Writing sci-fi/fantasy does not mean you can just sh-t out random excuses at random times, suspension of disbelief is supposed to let you deal with a couple low-probability moments and your world and story still has to remain consistent and whatever rules you establish have to be followed, otherwise it's just a chaotic mess.

""Characters/story can only be as smart as the writer."" - And the writers of ME:A were all dumber than a bag of bricks. I don't care if this hurts anyone's feelings - this game has trash narrative, trash characters and trash lore. The only thing the Andromeda writing team should be allowed to write down going forwards is the  customer's orders in their local fast food restaurant.",1704118156,1704118156,False,14,1,0.609307050704956055,0,True,False,False

Mass Effect is a very large reason why I am so heavily invested in RPGs, sci-fi, and videogames in general. It was my first experience with a truly choice driven story, where my actions had consequences. I could be the shining knight or dastardly spacer, the choice was mine. All of this is to say that Mass Effect means very much to me, while Andromeda certainly doesn't reach the heights of it's predecessors, it also is far from the black sheep it's made out to be. 
I was part of the overall sentiment that Andromeda was a broken and failed mess at launch, the lack of facial animations and overall polish left a sour taste in my mouth. It has taken me five years and three restarts, but I can finally say I enjoy this game for what it is. The combat is insanely fun, the characters while no where near the likes of Garrus or Liara, still provided many chuckles and endearing moments that kept me invested.

Ryder (and his dialogue) felt fresh, and was pretty funny throughout. There was a brevity to the game in general, and yet there was plenty of dialogue (or things to read) that brought a bit of emotion to my surface. 
The gameplay was fast and (at least on hardcore) presented a nice challenge that eased up as time went on. Which is how it should be. 
I can't say much for the music, nor could I in the Trilogy. In those games you had...the galaxy music and the end credits as bops for me. Ditto for Andromeda. 
The only actual complaint I have, is that because they focused on a more open concept to each major planet, the minor 'find them as you go' missions were locked to those planets, and not just finding them in space.
It was fun to find stuff to do as you went about planetside, but it would have been nice to find bad guys to board in space, too.

Overall, I'd give Andromeda a 9.5 out of 10. It's missing a bit here and there to be perfect, but it's damn near perfect to me. (The Trilogy is the same for me if you're wondering. It's the lack of music for me for all 4 games.)",1703649609,1703649609,True,5,1,0.51193469762802124,0,True,True,False

These people — the ones spearheading the initiative and the thousands more still in cryosleep — have given up their lives in the Milky Way and shipped off to the Andromeda galaxy in hopes that whatever’s there is better, or, at the very least, habitable.

So too is Mass Effect: Andromeda about new beginnings. More direct, it’s not a memorial service. Developer BioWare very sparingly makes any reference to characters from the Shepard Trilogy — it just doesn’t feel like that’s what we’re here for. This is a Mass Effect game in name only. Sure, there’s a lot that’s recognizable. The presentation looks the same and many of the proper nouns are familiar. But this isn’t something that latches onto its past.

Commendable as it might be, Mass Effect: Andromeda would have been wise to take more cues from previous games.

Exploration is the central theme of Mass Effect: Andromeda because protagonist Scott/Sara Ryder (depending on the gender you choose) is the person in charge of founding outposts on the “golden worlds” — the planets that have been scouted ahead of time as perfect candidates to live on. All that intel turns out to be wrong and none of them are immediately ready to support life.

The goal pivots to making these planets viable homes, usually accomplished by slowly cleaning it of environmental threats. Eos, the first of these planets we come across, is plagued by radiation. As Ryder completes various tasks (some in the main storyline, some side missions), the radiation eventually subsides. This allows for more of Eos to be explored, which, in turn, allows for completing more tasks to make it even more viable. It’s all very cyclical like that.

It’s also all very dull. Mass Effect: Andromeda struggles to find a foothold because it spends far too long without an easily-identifiable conflict. In Shepard’s arc, the Reapers were out to purge all life and essentially reset the galaxy. Shepard and crew had to stop that. The threat was imminent and constant. It was easy to point to the Reapers and say “That. That’s what we’re fighting. That’s why we’re here.”

Andromeda isn’t like that. It’s so concerned with shrouding itself in mystery that it neglects giving us any real reason to trudge forward. At least it’s thematically consistent in the way it emphasizes exploration, making the player venture into the unknown as Ryder has to do the same. It’s just that driving across miles of barren desert in hopes of finding something interesting is inherently uninteresting. 

Instead, Andromeda raises question after question about things that aren’t quite directly related to Ryder’s objective. We’re there to settle down and establish a colony. Learning about these new enemies — the uber-aggressive Kett aliens and the synthetic machine Remnant race — feels somewhat tangential even if exploration is largely about gathering information. We’re asked to put faith in the fact that this is going somewhere significant. It eventually does, as things pick up somewhere in the second act. The latter third is entertaining, mostly because Andromeda is finally forthcoming with what’s happening.

The plot problems bleed into the overall mood of the game. At times, this feels like a bizarre take on Mass Effect. Too many characters are relentlessly upbeat and positive. A new beginning is an angle brimming with hope, sure, but not nearly enough people approach this scenario with believable trepidation, caution, and concern.

Tonal issues are a major problem until Mass Effect: Andromeda narrows its scope enough to focus on one thing. (I can’t get over an early talk where a Krogan essentially hand-waved the Genophage away under the logic that it was a long time ago and let bygones be bygones.) Unchecked optimism permeates too much of this game. It’s all so vanilla. 

The new conversation wheel has a lot to do with it. Gone is the classic Paragon and Renegade dialogue options to firmly establish your character as a good guy or bad guy. Replacing it is a more nuanced system of answering either logically, emotionally, casually, or professionally. Rarely does it feel as if it’ll make a difference. Often, all the answers seem functionally the same. It’s so hard (maybe impossible) to make Ryder into an asshole. It’s more about how sappy or dopey you want them to be.

That boss fight (and all fights, really) are enjoyable because of Andromeda‘s most significant addition to the series: A jump jet. Combat is far faster and more movement-based than in the past. The opposition is designed to flank and to flush you out of cover, making this game more Vanquish than Gears of War. Sitting still for too long is a death sentence, even with biotic powers and two teammates on your side.

The role-playing aspect of combat comes from a tried-and-true system of assigning skill points to powers and attributes, but it also comes from a less intuitive crafting component. Ryder must regularly scan the environment to earn research points, use those points at a station to develop blueprints, and then finally craft them from acquired resources.

It’s overwhelming deciding what type of technology to invest in (human, Kett, or Remnant) and trying to figure out if it’s better than what you’re already using. Or, if it’s better than something else in your inventory that you don’t have equipped but should. Or, if there’s something in the store that you should just buy instead. Or, if it’s worth waiting just a little longer and crafting something that will unlock soon. This is confusing bloat that unnecessarily bogs everything down.

Where that’s pared down is in the cooperative multiplayer. Mass Effect: Andromeda sports a four-player wave-based horde type, almost identical to what was found in Mass Effect 3.

Being immersed in this brand new Galaxy is intriguing, even when there’s not much happening. Mass Effect: Andromeda‘s flaws are noticeable and hard to ignore. But, eventually, it becomes easier to live with them. Maybe something will push you along, maybe the spirit of discovery that’s omnipresent?

Mass Effect: Andromeda spends a lot of time not really feeling like a Mass Effect game. If anything, it feels like a spin-off — the sort of thing created by another studio that’s unsure about what direction to take it. Like in the game itself, there are problems with the atmosphere.

After playing through the campaign, I don’t think it is as bad as people have said. Andromeda emphasizes more on exploration with its structure. Even though there’s a looming presence of evil or impending doom, the story was rather lighthearted and inconsequential.

The opening section of the game was long and tedious. After 3-4 hours the game finally picked up and opened to the players. You mostly explore 5-6 planets with different biomes/ environments. Some were open-world/sandbox type, while others were quite linear. The vehicle in this game was more enjoyable than Mako in the first game, especially after you upgraded everything. The combat was snappy and satisfying. You can experiment with different loadout, team composition, and even change skill profile mid-battle.
The graphic wasn’t as bad as it was at the release. I rarely saw glitches or bug throughout my campaign. But, you got sense that some things weren’t supposed to be or unfinished for most part. Sometimes it can be a little distracting. It didn’t help that there were very few new alien races added to the game, while other were left out entirely.

Main story is average at best. The dialogue and voice acting are good though, just like in other Bioware’s titles. There are variety of missions and side stories to distract you for hours. But, the branching dialogues or paths offer very little incentives and payoffs. You don’t feel the consequence of your action and choice immediately or throughout the game in meaningful way. 

Now that we know Bioware and EA abandoned this game, it doesn’t matter what choices you made or if we will get any answer to mystery and plot threads in Andromeda. Such a shame.",1703080779,1703080779,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Para mi este juego falla en absolutamente todo lo posible, sus puntos positivos falla y en los negativos falla todavia mas, es impresionante la mala y baja calidad que tiene este juego, no tiene buenas mecanicas, demaciados dialogos, textos y monologos que no solo no tiene impacto alguno a la historia, si no que tambien no tienen punto alguno y ni siquiera sirven para dar contexto, terrible, el mundo abierto es enorme y  horrible, vacio, sin utilidad aparente y esta lleno de recursos que no valen nada en el juego.
La historia tiene un sentido simple, ni mas ni menos, pero esta todo tan mal ejecutado que inclusive daña directamente a la historia y al gameplay, por ejemplo, al inicio de la historia vemos como un personaje (que tiene un olor a muerto terrible, otra cosa mala, los personajes que se mueren ya te das cuenta desde el momento que los conoces) que cambia de ""perfiles"", cada perfil tiene beneficios (no contras) y viene con diferentes habilidades, lo cual es interesante dado que plantea que vos podes tener diferentes play styles dependiendo de la situacion, el problema radica en que no solo vos no podes hacer eso, si no que, tambien todas las habilidades consisten en CCs largos con poco CD sin punto alguno y ademas no podes redistribuir tus habilidades a menos que vayas a base, lo cual, es estupido...
Las nuevas razas (una random y la raza antagonista) no se que tienen pero te puedo decir lo que no tienen, personalidad, punto, cultura, objetivo, carisma o algo util o que pueda llegar a gustar
Las armas son las mismas de siempre, tienen una mala calidad visual y poco mas
La interfaz y los controles estan pensado para alguien de consola y eso  causa que a veces el juego se sienta tosco con los controles
El villano y todo lo que tenga que ver con la trama no solo no tiene sentido, si no que tampoco tiene punto, el villano tambien puede fulminar a la raza random y tambien a vos, pero inclusive TE AYUDA a que seas mas fuerte militarmente hablando (que eso nunca lo vemos, siempre estas vos perdiendo tiempo como un boludo con los mismos 3 tarados corriendo por paramos desiertos, pero bueno) e inclusive se deja derrotar de la manera mas estupida posible
Los enemigos son todos tanques de balas ridiculos en NORMAL, si subis la dificultad lo unico que pasa es que sacan mas vida por tiro y vos infligis menos daño, patetico
Hay 1 o 2 jefes en el juego y despues se convierten en enemigos normalitos pesados que encima tenes que hacer algo concreto para derrotarlos no mas para que pierdas tiempo, porque divertido como tal el juego no tiene nada xd
Los puzzles son bien malardos, estaria bueno el poder saltarte algo tan basico, y ademas se hacen los complejos poniendo una especie de mapa donde tenes que escanear la zona para tener una idea de como es el puzzle, horrible y hasta anticlimatico, spoiler, no te llama el juego XD
El auto es una mierda, lento, bugeada y se siente horrible
El jefe final y el final es aburrido, anticlimatico (su muerte), de muy baja calidad y no te genera un sentimiento el haber completado el juego
El colonizar planetas no vale para nada mas que para avanzar a la historia, pero por el resto es algo desagradable
La raza random no aporta nada a la historia y no vale la pena su inclusion, es tonto
El visitar seguido los planetas solo sirve para hacer misiones
La escena sexual esta buena, pero todo lo que hay detras de la quest es horrible, inclusive los dialogos, los personajes aunque tengan algo de desarrollo estan muy desaprovechados, es lo unico que tenia algo de potencial en este juego, triste la verdad.

Bueno, lo dejo por aca XD
En resumen
No innova
No mejora
No cambia
No vale la pena mas que para perder el tiempo

The problem is they do so many things wrong it can really turn you off. And I'm saying this as a player who mostly plays games for the story.
Andromeda is like 9/10 for story, 10/10 for world/immersion, and fail for systems and mechanics.

The story starts fairly strong and there are intriguing threads that show up as you progress to try to keep your interest piqued but overall the pace feels tedious and boring. The big problem here is the sidequests.
The main quests are generally crafted well and have some really good moments. But it's not fleshed out enough. You really need the sidequests for a richer experience of not just the story but the immersion of living in Andromeda. And there are good sidequests that do this, mostly relationship quests. What slows it all down are the many other fillers and you just really don't know which are going to be just a boring waste of  time. When they do waste your time, the momentum is all gone.
This really is a good example of how quality counts over quantity.

I have a fuller analysis of pros and cons here https://gq-game-mods.blogspot.com/2023/12/game-review-mass-effect-andromeda.html  but here are the basic drawbacks:

A lot of mechanics are really badly thought out but if you play on Normal difficulty thankfully you don't have to care too much because the drops you get and your strong companions will basically be enough. On Normal you can ignore research, cryo pods, apex missions, even credits. None of that is important for actually getting through the game.

The plot, while confusing at first, raises an interesting point about people's urge for a new beginning and supposed freedom that it gives and their inability to get away from their problems as individuals and as a society.
Although, I enjoyed my relationship with my squadmates, I felt like the loyalty missions were kind of detached from the main plot. As much satisfactory and wholesome they were, I did not feel they are nesessary to complete my mission, and I even not sure they affected the final result that much.

If anything, the combat and character building is pretty okay, and the idea of building a new galactic society from nothing is a solid one, in terms of both gameplay and narrative.

I adore the mass effect series and had deliberately put playing this off as it felt against the... spirit of just calling a story done, but in the interest of entertainment, myself and a handful of friends endeavoured to play it on stream, and see if its... as bad as we'd always feared.

It was far worse. It's been nearly 7 years since this game came out, my PC is mostly new parts, good CPU, great GPU, lots of ram and a nice SSD for the game to run on. Yet, Texture pop in was RAMPANT, animations on some of the alien models like turians clipped through themselves like hell, As you probably know most of the facial animations are complete memes, half the human cast go through the game with an empty headed look, staring through all the terrain and a light smile like the sun is warming their face, all while they're being told their dad is dead and everything has gone to ****.

The gameplay is middling at best, sloppy, unexplained features, poorly designed UI, horrible default keybinds and a massive overload of information at the start immediately baffles the player and keeps them from getting properly involved. Your abilities aren't well explained, nor are where they are bound or shown on the main UI, the jumpjet is a sloppy, lacklustre little airfart that half the time has you bouncing off walls Ryder doesn't mantle and climb or sliding over 144p rocks textured like an early Playstation 2 game. The weapons are immediately more complicated. They've evidently attempted to go back and hearken to Mass Effect 1s' looting system with weapon mods and ammo types and such, but they included the guns themselves in that, and the menu for accessing this all is slow, unresponsive, poorly controlled, scaled awfully and assaults the user with a deluge of information in tiny tight pockets wrapped in vast confusing gaps so you're left unsure what connects to what. The guns feel weak, aimless, sloppy, even though it is early game, the guns somehow feel worse than the starter weapons in other games... when you're using them. Your teammates all seem quite happy with their other weapons, that you, at least as far as I could see, can't change. But they won't share, very enterprising of them. 

All of this wouldn't be so bad but hey, it's a mass effect game, is the story at least good? From what, admittedly little I played? No, it is not. From the word go Alec Ryder, the main characters father, is presented as a rather baffling wad of poorly understood overselling. He appears to be lord god master of all he is capable of, vastly outskilling anyone left behind in the milky way at such a scale, that he wouldn't have been allowed to leave for andromeda had he actually existed. As for who you actually get to come with you, irritating yes men, hero worshippers and lumps of room temperature paste that speak FAR more than is needed, somehow saying nothing. Akin to a B tier phase 4 Marvel movie with double the dialogue.

This of course, assuming you experience any, a pivotal conversation between a Turian security commander on the nexus and you is... cut off. He has a considerable amount of very important dialogue, explaining what happened to the station in your absence. Which is inserted into a brief walk, and a tram ride. A tram ride that is... significantly shorter than his dialogue, which abruptly cuts him off, mid important story detail, should you not stand around like an oaf, staring at a wall. Rather than lock this into proper dialogue, its dropped in as background flavouring... in an area significantly shorter than his speech is. 

I admit I didn't experience much of the 'nomad' the... Mako standin truck. But what I did experience, was it failing to climb a 30 degree incline, and an NPC telling me to ""turn on 6 wheel drive"" while the game helpfully displayed a hint... shift to boost. 
Naturally... I hit boost to get up the slope, logical given how the prior mako worked? No, I was to click left mouse button, to swap mode. Obviously. As the UI element roughly the width of a mosquitos nose down in the corner helpfully suggested... with a picture of the nose of the nomad in orange, and a mouse icon. I blundered into mode swapping by pure luck as the game had fed me the wrong hint.

Long and short of it is, I'm sure I'll be surrounded by other reviews of folk going ""oh it's not so terrible"" But make no mistake... it is dire, and an affront to the series. If you are dead set on experiencing some Mass Effect, go play Legendary edition again, go read a comic about it, anything else. This game may have been middling at best, had it, as i suspect it was at one point, been its own thing, not attached to the ME franchise.

But as a Mass Effect game, it is insulting. Avoid this, the poor reception and storied history of is dreadful launch do not do it justice.",1701988981,1701989402,False,2,2,0.496551752090454102,0,True,False,False

Either way, if someone looked at me this way IRL, I'd get the fuck out ASAP.

Still sub-[url=store.steampowered.com/app/606880]par[/url] as far as RPGs go, a great game taken as a whole! They very much nailed this whole ""pioneers in a new world"" vibe, including, but not limited to, giving you different gameplay experiences when first landing on a planet VS a couple terraforming steps later. Dialing down on the number of races, fleshing them out more than one single quirk, that they should've done all along. I was going to complain about the emphasis on research, until I found that good old loot mechanics still exist. I'm certainly not complaining about the option to shoot for the guns I fancy the most. Last but not least, the combat's some solid cover shooting. It REALLY benefits from Bioware finally breaking up those corridors they grew to love in previos titles.

And without a doubt, the Legendary edition made it significantly more enjoyable. But it's also terribly linear in places. And the ""witty"" dialogs are plain stupid. And so I read in numerous reviews that ME Andromeda, apart from being a bland game, also has bad dialog, compared to the ME triology. But, and let me stress this, this is completely untrue. Where ME1-3 offer unnatural dialog choices and often also sleazy pick-up lines, ME Andromeda shines. The dialog here comes across as things real people would be saying to each other. Another thing people complained about, was low quality facial expressions and voice sync. But this has obviously been fixed in the Deluxe edition, because everything looks just great. 

So I have now, after 127 hours, completed the game. And i still think it is a gem. In many ways it blows the ME triology out of the water. It is different in many ways, but in almost all of these it is better:

 - Tecnically, Andromeda shines. I did experience 2 or 3 dialog bugs though, so it isn't perfect.
 - The story is better than the one in ME 1-3.
 - As I stated earlier, the dialogs and interactions between the avatar and the NPCs feels much more realistic. 
 - The various worlds are at times breath-taking.

When it comes to gameplay, it is generally fine. There is however the constant risk of falling over ledges almost everywhere. This is ofthen handled by the game stating that you are not alowed to leave the area, and simply placing you back to where you came from. In other cases your fall is treated as a deadly accident, and you respawn att the latest Save-point. it is OK, but fewer ledges and less platform jumping might have helped too.

You've just imagined Mass Effect: Andromeda. 

As best as I can tell, someone who had never seen the original games asked for a list of features and ingredients, then handed the list off to some generic shovelware developer to make something that ticked all the boxes on the piece of paper. 

The writing is simultaneously bland and overwrought, throwing excessive significance and dramatic music at issues the player __has not earned__ and therefore does not care about. Most NPCs worship the player simply for existing, and it's just awkward. Your squad are tedious, their interactions are dull and safe, and the fake Australian accents on the Angarans are just irritating.  There's no real conflicts, no politicking or infighting; the moral dilemmas are entirely token.

Where Garrus was wry and badass and funny, Vetra is... dull.   

Where Wrex was angry and conflicted and awesome, Drack is... haha grumpy rhino lizard go brr. 

Where Mordin was a genocidal war criminal you could enjoy sending to a well-earned death, we have... Boring Fish Guy. 

Okay fine the humans were always dull, but at least Miranda had those pants. 

Tali being all weird and cool? Nope. Liara being a biotic freakshow? lolno. Legion being the best robot pals in the universe ever? You wish. No, we get Annoying Blue Scientist and Commando Karen. 

And of course you can't actually control your squadmates beyond pointing so there's no strategy or coordinating combos, so combat is that much less interesting. You just run around protecting your own skin, because your squadmates can't revive you either.  Whee. 

Resource gathering and crafting are even duller than they are in every other single AAA game, with no sense of achievement *or* casual collecting to provide any dopamine. Just boring grinding with no sense of reward. 

It's just a tedious timesuck with all the magic gone.

Edit to add: oh, and apart from a tiny handful, your Choices Matter just... don't.  All those moral dilemmas you wrestled with in previous instalments?

Youth, youth never changes. 

But right now I'm writing with a calm mind.

I wished this game presented good experience. The game have soooo many unpolished sides that it won't allow you to enjoy it flawlessly. Sounds, graphics, game mechanics etc. all of them have some minor or major faults. You cannot immerse yourself to this game fully because of these bugs.

That's a shame because when you don't encounter a bug you can feel that you're really enjoying the game as a Mass Effect fan. Your teammates seems shallow at first but when you get to know them you can see that they aren't. The Initiative have good history and all the related parties can give you good moments.

No. But is it deserving of the hate that has been heaped upon it? Absolutely not. 

The biggest frustration for me after beating Andromeda is that I know there will likely never be a true sequel to continue the story. I feel like Ryder and crew still have a lot of potential and it is sad to think that the finale of Andromeda is all we will ever get for resolution. Hopefully ME5 is a blockbuster success and an Andromeda sequel can sneak in afterward on its coat tails.

Whatever good there is, is ultimately countered by bad. Sure, there isn’t really any game-breaking bad stuff anymore. That’s been done away with patches, and that’s not to excuse it, of course, since releasing a game in that state is just a damn disgrace in the first place. 

While I certainly had fun with Andromeda, it helped that I went in with extremely low expectations in the first place, and fortunately didn’t have the baggage of thinking that the Mass Effect trilogy is fantastic. To me, it was just another entry in a line of mediocre sequels. And because of this, the stuff that was obviously hampered by the rocky development process, doesn’t get to me quite as hard as it would someone that was really into the Shepard trilogy. 

Should people play this game? Maybe. If you can stomach the first few hours where the game is pure confusion: What is happening, why is it happening, what am I supposed to do, where am I supposed to go, what does this thing do, why do I have to do it, et cetera. Then yeah. Okay. Not much of a sales pitch, but hey, it is what it is. 

Combat is fun, exploration is okay, main characters are memorable, the world is beautiful (at times), and there are dozens and dozens of hours of busy-work hidden away in the game if you’re into the whole “no quest left behind” mentality. Though in hindsight, I probably should’ve ignored maybe half of it. Going back and forth between planets for a beer run doesn’t just seem like a waste of time, it is a waste of time.",1701439752,1701439752,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some difference that you'll see in this game from the original trilogy is that we go from a confident war veteran who knows how to lead, to a coming-of-age story with a witty and unsure kid taking their father's spot as a pathfinder. There will be one cool new species the Angara though the whole origin side bit felt a bit unnecessary. Something I wish they kept was the old voice actors for the species as I could not stand Kumail Nanjiani's voice acting. A few issues I had with the game were how the game ran as well as a few bugs here and there. The main villain looked cute I'm not sure why they went with the halo instead of horns and a wide face with a small mouth and big eyes all making it look nonthreatening. Most fights were wave fighting not sure why. The game's overall story was very feel-good with everyone getting along which felt a bit overdone to me. Also too many cut scenes for how short the main story is. Some funny things here, although I played a female they called me ""him"" at one point, and in the ending when it was all over there was rapid plant growth which seemed very quick for all the damage that had happened. Overall the game should be seen as a side story and not as something to be taken too seriously. The game will feel repetitive but the different scenery is nice to look at.",1701411463,1701411463,True,2,0,0.503013074398040771,0,True,False,False

Yes.
Was this a good continuation of original trilogy game?
No.

After 83 hours, a year and a half and a trilogy of the original Mass Effect, I finally decided to write this review. What most reviewers say is unfortunately true. Andromeda has nothing to do with the original trilogy except for a few audio logs/logs found on the Andromeda ship. The logs themselves won't tell you much except why and how you ended up in another Galaxy, which most people will find out in the first half of the game. HOWEVER, even though this game has nothing to do with the original trilogy, I thoroughly enjoyed this game even after the weaker 15 hour ""prologue"". After completing the prologue and finally starting the game, I started to finally and properly enjoy the open world in 5 larger maps and one smaller map (which is still quite packed with missions and places to explore).
There are a lot of gameplay and options to progress through the game and battles (however, it's better if you additionally download mods that allow you to enjoy the game/battles even more) and I rarely experienced boredom. However, the worst decisions the developers could have made were the cutscenes of boarding both the ship and the ship to the Andromeda main station, etc. (Which took me 1 hour and 30 something minutes after completing the game to 100%) Therefore, I would use a mod for this ""event"".
As for the main and secondary characters in the game, I can only say this. From the beginning of the game, when I gradually got to know all the crew members and got to know them through dialogues or missions, I really thought they were all idiots and most of them drank my blood through their stupid and generally dry remarks. Anyway, towards the end of the game. Better to say, for the last 10 hours towards the end of the game, I rather liked them all, and Vetra's transition line really intrigued me so much that I ended up having a ""romance"" with her (Her missions were just a cherry on top of her whole persona). The only one that didn't suit me personally was ``our'' blue fool Palessaria, but that's probably just my personality.

In closing, I would like to say that although this game is not like our beloved original Mass Effect trilogy (for me MS2) I would still like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the game and became engrossed in both the story and the exploration of the different worlds that were both accessible by space ship or just by scanner.

Overall I would give this game 7/10 

BUT IF YOU WANT BETTER EXPERIENCE, PLAY IT WITH MODS (some mods no longer work and backtracking the game to older versions of the game is no longer possible, but you can still play with half of em)!!

I would definitely not recommend this game at full price, but for $10 and under (i.e. what I paid) it's worth it. Secondly, if you haven't bought Mass Effect Legendary Edition yet then 100% buy that first as the original games are far, far better than this. Okay, onto the review.

Right off the bat the TL;DR is that this game is fine. Definitely not as bad as people make it out to be and extremely overhated by the diehard ME fans despite it doing a lot of things right, and some things better than any other game in the series. Most of the negativity comes from the fact that this game completely did not live up to the hype set by the first three games, but there's also quite a few problems that this game has which heavily dampen what could've been an amazing experience. 

Let's start by talking about what this game does right: the movement and combat. This game has hands down the best shooting elements of any ME game. The movement is buttery smooth and the jetpack system allows for really fun engagements where you can utilize map verticality to flank and evade enemies. Contrast that with the original games, where the movement is extremely clunky and the shooting is cover-based and very typical for games of that era. I was blown away by these changes as they make the game feel completely unlike the other ME games, and far better than anything we've seen thus far. However, as good as the combat systems are, they get repetitive very quickly due to the abysmal enemy variety. There's like 15 enemies in this 45+ hour game. That being said I still enjoyed the combat a lot, repetitive as it was. 

Another thing this game does right is the environments, to an extent. I really liked the spectacle of landing on a new planet and not knowing anything about it, then getting to explore and see what they had to offer. The five main planets are big and fairly unique, and they look fucking gorgeous with the combination of maxed out graphics, Dolby Vision HDR, and my ultrawide monitor. There's so many moments where I would just cruise across a huge open plain, admiring the expansive backdrops that each of these planets have. There's also some really fun missions that utilize the open world, I especially liked the raids on enemy encampments which are super fun with the previously mentioned combat improvements. The downside to these new open world maps is that they feel pretty unfinished in places, and there's not a whole lot to do outside of the main quests. Overall I really liked them, and I think the open worlds have a lot of potential for this series. 

But now onto what this game does wrong, and to put it shortly: it's bloated and soulless. There's so many systems and mechanics that could've just been combined or omitted but aren't in order to pad out the length of the game. A lot of the areas are super huge for no reason and you spend a ton of time just spamming your jetpack to move from area to area. A lot of the main quests involve repetitive tasks that can't be sped up, like you're literally forced to play sudoku multiple times throughout the campaign. Something as basic as navigating the galaxy is slowed down with unskippable cutscenes when entering/leaving planets and other annoying mechanics. 95% of the side content in this game is extremely boring fetch quest type stuff, where you go to places and kill, scan, talk, etc. and the writing in this side content is also terrible. 

In fact the writing in this entire game is boring as hell and feels extremely corporate, like the people writing didn't want to offend anybody and made this game as mild as possible. There's no good/evil system and your character is a complete square with maybe 2-3 good lines in the entire game. The side characters are very forgettable, especially the human ones, and the arcs they go through are boring as well. The only character I liked was Drack, whereas in the original games I liked every character except for Kaidan.

It's a shame, because this could've been really good. Unfortunately, the final product is bogged down by weird gameplay decisions and a milquetoast writing department, but even with all its flaws I still had fun.

If it was a new franchise just starting out it would have more freedom but it's not.

Insanely boring enemy and encounter zones even insanity is boring and way too easy and can be cheesed.

I saw a comment that this game should be treated as a standalone game from the original trilogy. And indeed, I played it as such. Many said that it does not feel like a classic Mass Effect. Well, it does. This game feels like a Mass Effect game, the gameplay, the style, armor, kits, way to interact with NPCs. It is a mass effect game, but they added the open world style, something that really goes with the mass effect universe. IMagine if you had an open world game like this in Mass Effect 3. Not to fight remnant, but reapers. And about reapers, it should have been more cool if they would have added more info about the Initiative and Reaper attack on Milky Way. But that would have made the politics of AI more complex, maybe too complex. The game is a little buggy, but you can go over it, not something to cry about. The story of Andromeda is great, but it's damn hard to match the level of story-telling of the original triology. THe guys that created the first 3 games created one of the best stories ever(trust me, i read a lot, i play a lot and the story for ME 1,2 and 3 is...damn). So it's preatty hard to make something to aproach that level of masterpiece story. Yet, ME Andromeda still have a great story.
So, short version.
Pro: Feels like a updated Mass Effect gameplay, feels like a ME game, good story, good interaction, the graphics(damn,they are good), you can't get bored(much things to do, side quest,etc)
Cons: sometimes buggy, i personally wanted more connections to Reapers and Commander Shepard.
For the future: Well, i have imagination, so what would be cool in the next game, how about the last reapers going to Andromeda to rebuild their forces, another ark, a last ark, follows them to prevent ANdromeda to fall to the reapers. ON board of the ark,well, our favorite commander, Garrus and some others like Javik(to make matters more intresting, him turning evil to remake the protheans with the cost of the Hellius CLuster et comp). ANd like this you combine Andromeda with the rest of 3 games.

I finally finished this game 11/20/23, 16 years after the original Mass Effect was released. It's a non-Shepard spin-off and it did flop during release, with poor graphics and glitches in the animations, but had those not been the case, I think it would have done quite a bit better. 

I think the graphics and glitchy controls were the main problems, because I waited many years for those fixes and fixed the graphics with mods the game was much more enjoyable. Plus, at the time, we wanted something that was going to fix the way the trilogy had ended in such an unsatisfying manner - this game doesn't do that. On it's own, without glitches and graphic issues, in a vacuum, this would have been a decent game - there was a fun mystery and some of the alien crew were interesting (even if the human player character was quite boring). I belong to the Cult of Shepard. To me, Shepard IS Mass Effect. And so is Liara, Garrus, Tali, Wrex, Grunt, Legion, Miranda, Jack, Samara, Mordin, Kasumi, Thane, Zaeed, Ashley, Kaiden, etc all... 

This game was fun, the aliens were cool, and if we got a few Mass Effect games  every year or so, I'd say, why not zoom in and focus on some random group of people in the MEverse. But since we only get a game now every 5-10 years, and they've become so expensive and pass/fails for companies, you ask me to choose between a cast of newbies or Shepard & the dream team? I'll be team Shep every time!!!

Andromeda is divisive, but it can be fun if you go into it without hatred and bias. I *hated* it for not being about Shepard, so it took me a while to play it without feeling gross. And it was fun.

Single Player is still a very solid game.  It may not have the same stopping power or be as well thought out as the OT, but it still delivers a fun to play experience with some memorable moments. 

Combat and weaponry are easily this game's bread and butter.  Many classic OT weapons alongside some awesome new ones make the arsenal the best its ever been.  The combat is fluid and responsive, and new to the series features like jump boosting add a layer verticality and exploration to the game.  

The story is subpar for a Mass Effect title.  Personally I think it would have had potential if the DLC wasn't axed for the nightmare release that would become Anthem.  A Quarian Ark DLC would have elevated this game to a more worthy rating by fans, I think.

Not that it's a bad game but my god it's got it's flaws. Some missions lock you out from saving and the amount of times the auto save has sent me back far is painful especially going for the insanity achievement which is probably needed to pose a challenge after playing the ME trilogy.
You can bring back the heat sink mechanic which you still need to put in effort just to apply it to a single weapon so it's good i guess.
Nothing from the trilogy matters aside from basic lore from ME 1
No more Turian BF :( and the companions are mostly there because they said ""yea i've got spare time"" and to fill out the alien qouta. They have their moments but it feels like there is no emotional attachment to these characters. The story revolves around building another citadel in the far off galaxy but there really isn't much drive or urgency and becomes a ""yea add it to the list"" deal.
Despite ""finding a new home"" being a priority you would think you could explore anywhere but nope, can't check the other golden worlds yet. Railroads the story hard and nothing you do really matters. Side quests are also mostly the same and nothing special.

Either get it on sale or come in prepared just for the combat. Honestly just get the ME trilogy if you haven't already cause if you don't love that then you will not like this. 
It's also the only game i've seen where characters frequently shout ""Got more Ket!""",1700079358,1700079358,False,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

So this is the ""horrible game"" that everyone has been complaining about? I held off on even playing this game because I was expecting it to suck so badly, but it doesn't: it's a legitimately good game. You guys make me feel bad for bioware.

I mean don't get me wrong, not much stands out in this game and I think that might be the problem. The experience certainly isn't ""unique"" as compared to ME2 or ME3, but man, it's fun enough to just play around in this fantasy sci-fi world. It's certainly much better than ME1, and while your choices don't matter so much, they didn't in the other mass effect games either, ultimately.

This game has one thing that really makes it good though, and that's the gameplay. Granted, I might have overthought my build and accidentally created an invincible character (tech invisible basically makes it so you can keep recharging your shield, kinda OP), but still! It's a lot of fun to shoot those guns, customize my setup, and take down tons of mobs.

And yes, it scratches that mass effect itch. It doesn't for romance, but whatever, better not to fantasize over alien boobs anyways. I understand that the side characters were the main reason a lot of people played the mass effect trilogy, so if that's what you're into it for then prepare to be disappointed, but if you like the other things I mentioned then you'd be in for a surprise just how much this game succeeds where it does.",1700041373,1700041373,True,26,0,0.677255332469940186,1,True,False,False

second off, the final fight and conclusion feels super underwhelming. I feel like I completed so many eyeroll-inducing side quests involving tons of planet- and even system-jumping, and not much of it really came back in any way. remember the ME2 final mission? ...right, so I'll just leave it at that. (I know that's hard to top, but Bioware did it once, right? they *could* do it again. they did not.)

as controversial as the ending of ME3 is, I still remember how wowed I was playing through that final bit, and these choices are something I still sometimes think about and mull over, years later (well, okay, the Synthesis one was dumb as hell, but still). I realize this one is not a ""series finale"" per se and is supposed to build up to a continuation, but I personally haven't felt encouraged enough to play a sequel of this, if one ever comes out.

I will say, many of the bugs present at launch have been resolved by the time I've gotten to play this (and I did take my time) - so that's not something to worry about. it's now only the insane mimicry that (especially human) characters display at times that's the one thing left.

When did the game development community made a wrong turn and we came back to characters standing empty handed, but as if they were holding a glass while saying that it's about time to do another round of shots? How could they not see this? Did the developers skip the QA part of the development?

Bugs are everywhere in this game. Steam achievements that didn't count? T-poses? Visual glitches? Endless loadings? Locking yourself out of completing something? Exact same models with different textures? Comments on the current mission interrupted becuase your movement triggered other comment or on the countrary repeating some comments out of the blue from a dialogue that happened five minutes ago? Temporary UI elements that are not disappearing until you move to another planet? Crappy brighness in the desert, when you return to the game from the pause menu so that you can't see anything? Missing quest markers on the map? Or quest markers without a related quest that don't point to anything specific? Quest and journal logs that can't be marked as read so that your pause menu always has exclamation marks in it? Enemies stuck behind the walls or underground? You name it. It's all there. And that's a ""Definitive edition"". I'm scared to imagine what state this game was when it first got out.

And you might think: ""Well, maybe the gameplay is good?"". It's not. Main story is pretty short. Most of the time you'll be exploring the planets on foot or in the car, which is mostly boring and confusing. Many times you'll either accidentaly clear some outpost and a few quest stages later you'll have to return to that outpost to clear it again or you'll clear some place and instantly finish a new quest that you didn't have initially only to later meet somebody and hear that you are supposed to do something you already did unknowingly. Open world is not working here at all. There are no hints or directions that would suggest that you should clear the map in this direction, rather then the other. You can go in any direction and sometimes quests will make you go back and forth wich results in quests being completed in the wrong order. Also there are some quests like ""go find 3 datapads out there in the desert without any nav points"". You know why there are no nav points? Beacuse those items spawn randomly on some random locations when you get closer (they might even not spawn at all). I literally had to make two circles with the online map around the planet after clearing most of the quests just to finish two of ""those"" quests... Corridor-like gameplay that was used in the trilogy worked waaaay better than this open-world madness. 

Exploring the cluster in your spaceship is boring too. Whenever you find an ""anomaly"" on the unexplored planet it is either some resource or some river or a crater. Amazing! Much anomaly! Very much wow!

Speaking of resources - don't bother collecting them. Hoarding is not rewarding in this game. So is crafting. Just chose two guns that you like and a set of armor and don't do anything else. It's not worth it. And what is the point of limiting the resources in the shops, but resetting the shop as soon as you board your ship? Why force the player reloading the level if you could just make those items infinite?

Also the balance is a bit off. At least in terms of leveling up your companions. I've finished playing on the 76th level of the character. That means that my followers had around 40 skill points I could not spend on anything because everything was maxed out already. + 1 item in the pause menu that always has an exclamation mark.

Your quests will also make you travel from a planet to a planet a lot. And each time you land or take off - there is an unskippable prerendered cutscene. You could think that it is there to hide the loading screen - but there is a loading screen right before that cutscene... So why? Why do I have to spend more time on watching those scenes then actually doing the quests? Why not hide the loading under the cutscene and as soon as the level is loaded - let me skip the cutscene that I've already seen a dozen times.

On the visual side - the game looks pretty good (when there are no visual glitches), even providing some nice scenes you could capture... If only there was a photo mode or at least a button to hide the UI... So yeah. Screw me and my screenshots.

This game has a multiplayer mode instead! Which nobody plays anyway because all the progression in the multiplayer is based on the lootboxes.

Some characters are interesting. But only some. Peebee, Liam and Jaal. The others... Well, I felt indifferent to them. And 95% of the time you can skip all the dialogs without really listening into them, because 95% of you dialog decisions won't make any difference and will have no consequences. Whether you chose ""logical"" or ""professional"" or ""emotional"" choise - won't matter almost always.

Plotwise it's not great too... An unknown enemy who tries to conquer everything by turning different friendly races into it's mindless followers? Where have I seen that? A race that went extinct without a trace and that everybody thinks that they were supersmart? Wasn't this kind of a big thing in the original trilogy? Why repeating?

The game doesn't actually ends by saving the humanity. The enemy is still out there. You've just defeated the outcast from the rows of your enemy. Leaving you with a lot of open plot cliff hangers, that developers didn't even tried to explain. I guess it's a base ground for the future parts, but for now it looks incomplete and stupid...

Overall - I would recommend you to avoid spending your time on this game. I bought it in the pack along with other Bioware games. And now I see why it was so cheap for a pretty recent game.

If you want to play space exploration game - get yourself a No Man's Sky. If you want some good plot driven sci-fi game - buy Mass Effect remastered trilogy.

Unless they make next game great and it will feature the option to import a save file from this one - avoid this game. It not good. It's not worth your time.

Mass Effect: Andromeda takes players on a thrilling journey to a new galaxy, and I must say, the experience is nothing short of spectacular. The game boasts a captivating storyline that had me hooked from the beginning, with twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.

One of the standout features of Mass Effect: Andromeda is its rich and immersive narrative. The developers have crafted a story that seamlessly weaves together elements of exploration, mystery, and adventure. The diverse characters you encounter add depth to the plot, each with their own unique personalities and backstories. It's a testament to the game's writing that I found myself emotionally invested in the fate of the Andromeda Initiative.

Visually, Andromeda is a stunning masterpiece. The graphics are nothing short of breathtaking, from the vast landscapes of alien worlds to the intricate details of the characters and their environments. The attention to detail is commendable, and it truly enhances the overall gaming experience.

Playability is another strong suit of Mass Effect: Andromeda. The open-world design allows for a sense of freedom and exploration, encouraging players to delve into the various nooks and crannies of the galaxy. The seamless transition between planets and the Nexus hub is a testament to the game's well-executed design, making it easy for players to lose themselves in the vastness of Andromeda.

Combat in Mass Effect: Andromeda is a highlight that sets it apart from other modern shooters. The cover system is intuitive and adds a layer of strategy to engagements. The fluidity of the combat mechanics, combined with a wide array of weapons and abilities, makes every encounter feel dynamic and exhilarating. It's a breath of fresh air in a genre where some titles tend to prioritize style over substance.

In conclusion, Mass Effect: Andromeda is a stellar addition to the Mass Effect franchise. Its compelling story, breathtaking visuals, seamless playability, and engaging combat make it a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike. Despite a few initial hiccups, the game has evolved into a spacefaring adventure that stands tall among its predecessors, offering an experience that is both nostalgic and refreshingly new.",1699635416,1699635416,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 -- Are the facial animations and dialogue cheesy? Absolutely and whether it's your first playthrough or your third it simply doesn't get any easier to watch the jank. 

-- How's the writing? Subpar at best, but it's an all too familiar and predictable plot which is extremely uninteresting in the long run and it ends exactly as you would expect. 

-- Is it woke? You bet it is. I don't like to reflect on identity politics or woke SJW nonsense since I need to preserve at least some brain cells for the future and there is only so much rot I can take, but there is one scene in particular which to this day is still more uncomfortable than a communist liberal at a Trump rally in Florida. 

Liam, a human black male, and Jal, an effeminate and overly emotional male alien of some weird species, are in a locker room playing a game. They take turns removing their battle armor in pieces and with each piece of armor they remove they must reveal one of their innermost secrets. To say it's a little girly isn't adequate which would make more sense if you knew the full context since these two are bonding like a pair of high school girls, but whatever Bioware, this is your woke nonsense.

It gets worse. At one point during their game Jal is walking by Liam and his bare alien ass is on the screen plain as day. This isn't a brief one or two second ass shot, no sir, it's on the screen way longer than it needs to be and I think Jal turned his head to wink at Liam. That was just [b][i]disturbing[/i][/b]. I'm pretty sure after my Ryder left the room those two banged. Wouldn't surprise me at all. 

-- What about the characters? Linear, one dimensional and poorly written. I ignore most of the characters anyway or smoke a doobie the size of a submarine and crack a smile as I enjoy their asinine behavior as comedic entertainment. 

-- Does it still have bugs? Unfortunately and while many of the launch issues have been addressed with various patches and updates there are still immersion breaking bugs.

The combat is the only solid part about the whole experience. It's not as well rounded as ME 2, but it is a logical evolution of mechanics from the third game and makes sense in the way it has been tweaked so when it works it works really well. However, the fluid combat dynamics and the hard hitting combos you can create aren't enough to save this game. 

[b][u] The biggest reason why this game failed:[/u][/b] It's boring. You spend way too much time running around between various planets wasting your time on menial tasks so it's very obvious this is just meaningless filler content that exists to pad the playtime and compensate for the bad writing. Quite a few of these side quests are still bugged and cannot be completed so it's worth noting for the completionists you won't be able to 100% this game.",1628036989,1699496982,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

From what I heard at launch, the animations were abysmal, but that was 6 years ago. Although the patches made it a lot better, you can still spot soullessness and the mouths overworking here and there, but it was not that big of a deal. 

Overall I enjoyed playing it. Getting used to the new mechanics was hard at first, but the combat is really satisfying and fun once you master it. Love the story, most of the time my face expressions ranged from O_O to :O.

Moving away from the paragon/renegade is very weird though, making the main character neutral. Have to say I miss it a little bit.

I have yet to try the multiplayer, I'm a single player kind of person.

I've replayed the trilogy countless times. So will I be replaying Andromeda? Absolutely! It had rough start that lowered the reputation, but still it's Mass Effect. And I love Mass Effect.",1699487874,1699487874,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

It means there is more work involved in getting to the action.

On top of that, the story doesn't feel as epic. Nothing can be as menacing as the Reapers i the trilogy. Instead of being an experienced hero, your character is now a young person suddenly given vast responsibilities.

However, if you look at it as a stand-alone game, it's really rather good. The graphics are incredible and run on a fairly modest PC. It has a real story unfold,with a feeling of real-life randomness and it may take you by surprise on replays. You have several different planets with very different landscapes to really explore. Of course, you have a likeable Krogan as a companion!

On top of it all, it's a huge game. It's as long as all three trilogy games added together. It's an absolute bargain on Steam.

The co-op multiplayer is fun, too. Being co-op,the other players are friendly. Obviously, there are fewer playing it today but you should get a match.

it's a game I go back to play again and again. You might find the same.

It is a worthy successor to the original trilogy, and a testament to BioWare's ability to craft immersive and engaging sci-fi worlds.

The game takes place in the Andromeda galaxy, where a group of explorers from the Milky Way have embarked on a mission to find a new home for humanity and other races. You play as Ryder, the Pathfinder, who is tasked with leading the colonization effort and discovering the secrets of the ancient and mysterious Remnant technology. Along the way, you will encounter new allies and enemies, as well as familiar faces from the previous games.

The gameplay of Andromeda is a blend of action, role-playing, and exploration. You can customize your character's appearance, skills, and equipment, as well as your squadmates' abilities and loadouts. You can also switch between different combat profiles that grant you bonuses and special powers, such as biotics, tech, or combat. The combat is fast-paced and dynamic, with a variety of weapons, gadgets, and environmental hazards to use. You can also use a jetpack to jump, dodge, and hover in the air, adding a new dimension to the combat.

The exploration aspect of Andromeda is one of its strongest points. You can travel across vast and diverse planets in your vehicle, the Nomad, which can be upgraded and customized. You can also scan and collect resources, craft new items, and complete side quests and loyalty missions for your crew. The planets are rich in detail and atmosphere, with stunning visuals and sound effects. You can also discover and activate Remnant vaults, which are massive and intricate puzzles that unlock terraforming benefits and rewards.

The story of Andromeda is compelling and immersive, with a mix of humor, drama, and romance. You can interact with your crew and other characters through dialogue choices and actions, which can affect your relationships and the outcome of the story. You can also romance some of the characters, which can lead to intimate scenes and deeper bonds. The main plot revolves around the conflict with the Kett, a hostile alien race that seeks to assimilate other species, and the mystery of the Remnant, an ancient civilization that left behind advanced technology and clues to the origin of life in Andromeda. The story is full of twists and turns, and offers multiple endings depending on your choices and actions.

Mass Effect: Andromeda is a game that will keep you hooked for hours, with its expansive and immersive gameplay, stunning graphics, and captivating story. It is a game that fans of the series and newcomers alike will enjoy and appreciate. It is a game that deserves the best rating there is,

 The only bad things were rare technical issues that comes with not being tested enough. Some missing dialouge (no sound when a reply was expected, but not critical during my experience), the ambient sound sometimes borked out, small things overall but takes one out of the moment. Some UI-stuff could have worked somewhat better but still functional. The only thing that was ""annoying"" was that every map felt really tiny, not enough space between sites, the ""town over"" was sometimes literally 3 min away.

I think many of us did the game an injustice by our initial rejection of this game. Mass Effect was one of those beloved series that found its way in our heart, with the ""emotional"" mini-game that was managing the crew. As someone on the autism-spectrum, it was almost a 'friend simulator'.  Having just had Mass Effect 3 finish the series in an abrupt way that IMO didn't properly honour the emotional connection we had to the characters - it was simply inevitable that we would reject something that came after with a new cast.

With the benefit of hindsight, this was an excellent Mass Effect series that absolutely did the original series justice. Everyone who worked on this game deserved more love for what they created.",1697969110,1697969110,True,6,0,0.522430956363677979,0,True,False,False

To say that I quickly fell in love with game would most certainly be a lie. That first play-through took me two attempts over two years. But the game has been improved significantly since its original launch state. The bugs are much less severe and less frequent. The character animations and dialogue cinematics are greatly improved. The world traversal and combat however have always been top-notch.

What hasn't been improved or changed is the script, which is frequently lacking the sophistication and maturity of the original Mass Effect Trilogy and, sadly, often quite cringe inducing. For example, the romances are generally quite enjoyable and convincing, but the dialogue for flirting can be utterly atrocious. Non-romantically, some crew member are so grating and/or obnoxious that you will probably avoid them as much as possible. It got to the point that I barely ever took one crew member on missions because of it. It's meant to be ""endearing"" I assume, but it comes across with entirely opposite energy.

The story, on the other hand, is passable. The first time through, it was very difficult to connect with it. But over time, I have warmed to it. The problem is that it lacks a compelling antagonist and a clear logic to the events of the story and the setting itself. It's nowhere near the depth and thoughtfulness of the original trilogy. But it's serviceable.

In terms of the setting, the art direction is frequently gorgeous and creative (despite two planets being essentially the exact same biome, which was a colossal waste!). Traversing the world in the ATV or on foot is always fun, and there's lots to explore. However, open-world fatigue is only matter of time. I found myself dreading new worlds because of the open-world busywork I knew it would bring. In the last quarter, I really just wanted to the game to end, and it was because of the open world design.

The galaxy map, however, is really impressive, although it doesn't really make much sense as a literal technology. But as an abstract representation of space flight, it is really good.

Overall, Mass Effect Andromeda is a spin off game, and so it has the B-Team flaws that you would expect. But it is a beautiful looking game that is really fun to play, despite some issues. It's worth playing, that's for sure.",1697968762,1697968762,True,12,2,0.595906972885131836,0,True,False,False

Mass Effect: Andromeda, the fourth installment in the beloved Mass Effect series, takes players on an intergalactic adventure that spans across vast and beautifully realized worlds. With 20.7 hours spent unraveling the mysteries of the Andromeda galaxy, my experience with the game was a mixed one.

Andromeda introduces a new cast of characters and sets the stage for a fresh chapter in the Mass Effect universe. The premise, which involves the journey of humanity and other Milky Way species to a new galaxy, is filled with potential. The Andromeda galaxy offers a canvas for exploration, intrigue, and discovery.

The game's vast open worlds are visually stunning, with each planet showcasing its unique biomes, ecosystems, and challenges. The Frostbite engine brings these environments to life with remarkable graphical fidelity, making the exploration aspect of the game genuinely compelling. The Nomad, a versatile all-terrain vehicle, adds a sense of freedom and mobility to your planetary expeditions.

Gameplay in Mass Effect: Andromeda retains the series' signature third-person shooting mechanics, but it introduces a more dynamic, fast-paced combat system. The freedom to choose between different classes and abilities provides a level of customization, allowing players to shape their gameplay style. The introduction of the Jump Jet and Dash abilities also adds a layer of mobility and verticality to battles.

Despite these promising elements, Andromeda faced criticism upon its release, mainly for technical issues and character animations. While many of these issues have been patched and improved since the initial launch, they were noticeable during my playthrough. Occasionally, facial animations seemed stilted, and character expressions could feel unnatural, which detracted from the overall immersion.

The storyline of Andromeda is serviceable, though it doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessors. The main plot, while engaging at times, lacks the epic and emotionally resonant narrative that fans of the series have come to expect. The cast of characters, both new and old, have their moments, but some character arcs and interactions felt underdeveloped.

The game's dialogue and choices are classic Mass Effect, with a variety of responses and branching paths, allowing players to shape their own Ryder, the protagonist's personality. However, the dialogue can occasionally feel less nuanced and impactful compared to the earlier titles in the series.

Exploring the galaxy and building alliances with various species are integral to the Mass Effect experience. The loyalty missions and the development of relationships with your crew are highlights, as they allow for character depth and memorable moments.

In conclusion, Mass Effect: Andromeda is a game that carries the weight of its predecessors' legacy. With 20.7 hours of gameplay, I was drawn into its sprawling universe and the potential it held. While it offers elements of exploration, a dynamic combat system, and glimpses of the Mass Effect magic, it also has notable flaws, including technical issues and a storyline that doesn't quite match the epic scope of the original trilogy. Despite its imperfections, Andromeda is a game that may still appeal to fans of the series who seek to continue their journey in a new galaxy, as long as they are willing to overlook its shortcomings.",1697716341,1697716341,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However I feel that it should be treated as an entirely separate game that plays homage to the original trilogy. The reason why I say this is because, players dive into this game with the nostalgic expectation of the trilogy, which is what made the first of many reviews thumbs down the game.

The game rushes you in the Heleus Cluster of Andromeda the resource rich dream of the pathfinder initiative; only to find that most of its planet has become inhospitable within your 600 year cryo-sleep from the Milky Way. Here you venture out with your father Alex, and brace yourself towards that tragedy that is about to come.

Andromeda's narrative is far from Shepard's as your main priority in the game is to search for viable planets for your Initiative to settle and thrive. Engaging with new aliens both friendly and hostile, participating a war to further your cause and becoming the very being the Milky Way galaxy's council has banned due to the Geth Uprising.

Gameplay on the otherhand is more flexible with numerous available resets and no locked in class that solidified part of your character in the original trilogy. With a myriad of class and skills and an open Map for each planet, this plays more of a multiple sandbox RPG than your usual Mass Effect. And to top this up our characters now have JET PACKS!

Characters and banters are quite different in the game with some repetitive / annoying; other than the usual favorite Krogan and hot Turian, there is an additional Alien character that most players absolutely love in a romance. Speaking of romance, it is more flexible as you become a possible flirt or ho, depending on you. There are still some annoying humans, but now we also have an annoying Salarian in the bunch that is more annoying that your counsel leaders. Unfortunately we can't Khalisah al-Jilani its face. 

In Comparison: When we played Shepard we were working mainly as a military commander who is keeping together the whole galaxy and uniting it towards the common threat of the Reapers. Shepard needed to make tough decisions such as deciding to blow up an entire system just because. On top of which, Shepard's story played as a Trilogy, whereas in Andromeda our character is not Shepard the commander, we're Ryder the pathfinder, an EXPLORER. There is of course still some recruitment involved similar to the original trilogy and the drive to unify the cluster towards a common threat, but that threat is not as big as the reapers. And just like Mass Effect 1, it still needed to be fleshed out; which what made Andromeda's thumbs down reviews jarring since we're far from getting more of the story other than from official books.",1697170350,1697170350,True,94,1,0.805103898048400879,2,True,False,False

Yes - people will tell you the story is a bit meh, the dialogue is a tad cringe here and there, and the companions may not have as much depth as our beloved cast from the trilogy.

Exploring space is filled with pointless animations and switching from planet to planet takes aeon. Face animations are... weird, my character looks like freaking duck when she talks. You walk constantly with that freaking scanner so you can research and develop weapons. Biotics are nerfed to a point it feels pointless. Controlling the character feels horrible, trying to take cover when shot at is near impossible unlike in previous ME series where I don't remember once feeling like I couldn't take a cover.

The game in 2023 feels polished and smooth, but ultimately unsatisfying and a bit of a whiff on what could have been a great game.

The good:
- beautiful visuals, especially some of the space cutscenes
- game runs very well on my gtx 1070
- object and character models, animations, and textures are well done and preserve that mass effect vibe really well
- the mako is back!

The bad:
- the story somehow isn't very compelling. hard to put my finger on why but i don't feel any urgency or sense of connection to the plot
- the roleplaying aspect is extremely limited. feel like i'm watching someone else's story, rather than shaping my own. the different dialogue options don't seem to have any effect, and without the renegade/paragon system from previous games it feels like my character has no depth or personality
- combat is very janky. popping in and out of cover is weird. it is automatic, not button based, and that can be extremely frustrating - sometimes i walk up to a boulder but i don't enter cover, and proceed to get shredded. other times i try to leave cover to flank someone and i have to wrestle with the controls
- gunplay is tedious and horribly nerfed, because ammo is very limited. so i have to rely on ai teammates or make sure every shot counts. i'm playing on a fairly easy difficulty setting too. if i shoot more liberally, it's quite easy to completely expend the ammo for my pistol and sniper rifle in an open world engagement with 7-8 enemies, only to find there are no ammo crates in the area anyway and so i have to avoid more fights and drive to a base area to replenish ammo
- combat movement is also weirdly arcadey and i'm contantly wrestling with the controls. it just doesn't feel very fluid, and intuitive, despite the addition of jump packs which should be so much fun. I think the physics simulation is very basic compared to other games i've played recently, hence my difficulty with it
- the weapon and armour system has changed a lot from previous games and i find it really confusing. it also seems limited as i can only carry a couple of weapons at a time with my current class. the tutorials didn't do a good job of explaining how that works
- the companions are boring and annoying. i miss the old ME crew :(
- There is soo much talking and fetch quest type stuff and cutscenes early on. So little action. Even during missions, fights are very brief and mostly you're running or driving around. This is a mixed blessing because of how bad the combat is haha.

the ugly:
There's actually very little i'd say is actually ugly in this game, despite my many frustrations. I've never had a bug or crash. everything works ok. Honestly if they had created a new IP instead of using the Mass Effect brand, it could have done pretty well. 

I feel a bit sad to say this, because I'm sure a lot of people have put a ton of hard work into this game, but it just feels a bit lifeless and average. The last few times I've played I did it just to see if there was something more I was missing about it, because the gameplay wasn't very fun.",1696720228,1696720228,False,2,1,0.502526819705963135,0,True,False,False

I've played this game on PS4 prior to purchasing it on Steam for the PC, the platform I use for gaming now. I've played it enough across both systems that I've experienced the strange ""bugs"" that people are so quick to point out. Past that, my opinion is the game is fun; more so on Hardcore difficulty. While some enemies seem ""cheap"" on that level, it helped me make choices in what powers and abilities I was going to use.

While I haven't beaten the game on either PS4 or PC, I enjoy playing it. There are things that are irritating, but to me they're pretty easy to get beyond and to enjoying the game. I think the squad is a bit more fun than in ME3 and the worlds are varied to a decent degree. Missions are varied where some are major fun and others are so-so.

On a harder difficulty, planning out my engineer/infiltrator build more carefully, and sinking points into areas for the squad mates that I bring along all made for a good experience.

Mass Effect: Andromeda is the latest (so far) installment in the Mass Effect series. You don't need to play other games if you want to play this one, since the story ties are very loose and everything is happening in a different galaxy. But you probably should play Mass Effect Legendary Edition anyways, because it's just great.

Back to this game, MEA has it all: beautiful open world spanning several planets, likeable characters, a few new well-defined alien cultures, interesting story and quests, engaging gameplay, cool weapons, etc. The problem is all of that is buried under layers of boring fetch quests and lore, copied assets, silly dialogues, not-user-friendly interfaces and bugs.

The development story behind the game is quite messy (it's a bit of a wonder that it came out at all), but it just feels like the QA phase did not happen, and in the end they just put everything they had together and shipped it. So we got what we got - an epitome of a bloated game.

In the first ~10 hours I got pretty overwhelmed by 30+ quests dumped on me, too many different resources and a clumsy UI. Also started getting sick of the crew I started with - not likeable characters at all. But then I found characters I liked, quest lines that were interesting to follow, and learned to bear the rest. It wasn't until around 80 hours into the game when I started getting bored. So it's worth the money, I guess? More detailed below.

Pros:

- Great-looking open world with beautiful scenery and interesting alien cultures. Got that feel of exploration.
- As I mentioned earlier, there are interesting characters and quests, you just have to find them.
- There is a single talent tree with several branches, you can specialize in one or be a jack of all trades. So there are a lot of possibilities for progressions to match your playstyle. Starting class doesn't really matter. Eventually you can max out every branch, but I doubt you'll play for that long.
- Dialog choices that you selected before are grayed out.

Cons:

- The game is not very completionist-friendly. Some quests have markers, some don't, some have and then disappear. There are quests that you can't complete after some point, so they'll just stay in your quest log. There are some collectibles on the map that can't be collected. Some missions don't show in the journal, completed missions are sorted in unexplainable order. Achievements are buggy. Descriptions don't match, kills don't always register, one of the achievements is probably impossible without a controller etc. Nevertheless, I managed to get 100% without too much frustration.
- There are some bugs/missing features across the board. There are problems with Steam overlay - often the game doesn't function after closing the overlay.  There are some unpausable dialogues. Also when you press Space to skip a dialogue line, it sometimes skips two instead of one. There is no quick save button for no apparent reason (you can save from the menu, just not with a hotkey).
- Interface is a mess. There are some unexpected effects, sometimes you have to click too many buttons or one button many times. I got used to it though.
- Choices don't really matter, sometimes I would select something and hope that would change a character's reaction, but no, they don't even mention it. There are quest lines ending in nowhere, without any conclusion or reward (I'm looking at you, Firebreathing Thresher Maws of Doom!). The game ending is inconclusive with loose ends - looks like they were hoping for a sequel.
- Facial expressions are consistently terrible.

Neutral:

- Needs the necessary evil EA Launcher, but I didn't have a single issue with it. It's almost like it didn't exist.

The game world might be much smaller in scope than Starfield, but I think there is actually just as much content here packed into a far smaller space, and vastly more character interactions.

Mass Effect as a whole was a series of games that has meant alot to me over the years and still brings me joy, this game added to it. 

- Combat was way more fluid. I loved the fact that even as a sniper I could help in the fray with my other teammates.
- Having powers from all the classes with wide range combos felt great to try out
- The Nomad controlled WAAAY better than the Mako, with grip to climb up steep. I've spent years wanting to avoid driving but this game was more enjoyable in the exploration. 
- I loved ALL the companions this go. In ME1-3, I mostly stuck with just 2 usual companions unless I had to switch. In MEA, I wanted to see how they interacted with plots,other teammates etc.  
- Ryder is an underappreciated protagonist.  Are they Shepard? No but they were never meant to be the next Shepard. It was refreshing to see a new face take on threats and grow to handle their new position in a galaxy outside their own.

I think my only biggest gripe was dealing with Alien Sudoku but even then there were ways of getting around that.

It's so sad that media/ ""fans"" destroyed such a great potential for another continuing story. It was no means a perfect game but the characters, story and combat style pulled me in just as much as the original.

So, I recommend giving it a try, even if you are buying it on sale as a whim.",1695934406,1695934406,True,24,0,0.683072090148925781,0,True,False,False

I think the problem is that on the old Mass Effects, I took about 30 hours to finish and this one was double, it's not so funny, I was doing the same thing over and over, it was the first Mass Effect that I did not finish the side quests, also the planets have a lot of loadings with some of them having more than one load to walk through the planet, and the quests always force us to visit more than one planet. I could have been more stimulated if the main plot had been more interesting, but the final plot with the Archon was predictable, he looks like a Power Ranger boss.

Hated the game when I first played it back upon release. Six years later and I gave it another shot. The worst part about the game is how it was abandoned by the devs. No more support, no DLC despite the set-up for it in-game. Another patch, DLC, and a sequel and the game would be far more palatable. The loading screens / cinematics while traveling in space and on/off of worlds are far too long. Far too often the game gets in its own way. 

Oh well. It's not perfect and unfortunately it seems our characters and the future of Andromeda will be abandoned. That, to me, was the worst crime of this game. The building blocks were there. They could have switched back over to Unreal for the sequel. Still can. While I still had to push myself to get through some of the slog, the game isn't as bad as it once seemed.

POSITIVE:
-Gamepley wise, combat and exploring are pretty cool to the point that it's the only reason I still play the game.
-Graphcis are very aesthethic in general
-Story wise, it's getting interesting after 22 hours but it doesn't come close to ""exciting"" which was the main definition of all trilogy titles

NEGATIVE:
-game is really unpolished in some aspects and I think this is just one of those milk cows titles with minimal investment high profit plan (just release as is and instant forget, 0 support and bugfix after release) because there are some bugs present in gameplay, and even UI, and much of them are really that obvious that, as a QA myslef, I feel that they could have been caught and fixed during development even before QA process, if it had one, there's no way they were not aware of some of them after realease and even before it.

-but the thing which I found most repulsive is that all the classic and cool Milky Way alien species voices (salarian, krogan and turian) were changed/reinterpreted and sound like human voices with cheap and minimal voice manipulation and also is it just me or the female ones are even less alien and efectively sound like basic karens from the states.",1695402840,1695402840,False,0,1,0.452099055051803589,0,True,False,False

First of all, let me mention some of the good parts about the game - because it isn't devoid of deserved praise.
- The combat feels fantastic. Yes it's still a cover shooter, but with the new jump mechanic not seen in previous Mass Effect titles, it provides an added verticality to combat as well as another way to traverse the terrain. 
- The Multiplayer. Ok, the whole wave defence thing is a bit of it's time, but with the added objectives in the firefight missions, and the variety of different classes and combinations you can play with, it's a ton of fun!

Now let me talk about the stuff that had potential, but doesn't quite sit right.
- The story. I have spent a LOT of time in the Mass Effect Universe playing each game to the max, exploring all the different aspects of the classes, stories and the universe building with the races and their different cultures, and to an extent, this adds to that without dirty-ing anything already laid down by the first 3 games. While it doesn't add too many new races (2 and a half maybe... i dunno, I'm not gonna spoil the story for those who do plan to pick the game up), it does make sense due to the nature of the story. BUT, and it's a big but... if you were expecting any real connection to the first 3 games, there's not much outside of small quips in voice lines that mostly add nothing to the story at all.. until the last 10% of the game, which is where my mind is split on how I view the story. It makes sense that this whole game spends the majority of its time establishing itself as something separate from the mainline stories... but when that last 10% of the game is by far the best bit of the game, it really made me notice how much better it would've been if we just got a new game in that series. Weirdly enough, if this game had a sequel, it does potentially leave itself some interesting things to explore that I do believe would make this game look better in retrospect.
- Changing classes and powers on the fly. I can't decide whether i love or hate this feature. On one hand, it's great, it gives you options in combat and you can play with all the toys without having to start a hundred different playthroughs just to test them. On the other hand, it seems like a bit of a cop out and in some ways feels like it damages the gameplay both in pace and story. Yeah ok, the pathfinder can do that, thats the point of the character, but it doesn't make it a good design choice from a story perspective especially when you look back and think 'well, why did nobody in the mainline series have this ability, i'm sure it would've helped against the reapers a whole bunch!'. It just didnt have a strong enough reason to not stick with what was already there - but that's personal preference.

The bad... and my god, when this game does a bad, it sucks so incredibly hard.
- The antagonist. Yaaaaaaaaaaawn. I can't think of a more boring, single motived, bland, cliché villain in all of gaming. The Archon is so poor, not because it's compared to previous antagonists from the series that have been fantastic, but because it is so poorly written that I'm sure that someone's kid wrote that character and it was put in the game for them - that would be the only slightly acceptable reason for the character in this game... which leads me to the next issue...
- The rest of the cast. I dare you to count more than a handful of characters in this game that don't bore you to a state of save and quitting after each dialogue with them. Maybe this is amplified due to me playing Andromeda directly after completing legendary edition 100% before jumping into this, and thus getting to explore all of the characters from those games, who are all (for the most part) interesting, but jesus is this system full of the most bland beings in the Universe.
- Bugs and other Technical issues. Here we go; the bit I'm pretty sure everyone knows about, but let me tell you my experience. EA Play. Why, oh why? Just like with legendary edition, it completely screws up the game at certain points, forcing the EA overlay, crashing the game to desktop because the service goes offline 100 times a day, messing up achievements because it doesn't want to play ball with steam - its a mess. But its not just that which makes the game aggravating to play at times. Random crashes are everywhere, sometimes the UI bugs out and suddenly wants nothing to do with your mouse in menus, missions not complete-able without shutting down the game and reloading because it decided to put the thing you need to kill/scan under the playable surface, more UI bugs that dont allow you to mark things as seen so youre constantly having to look through everything to see if you missed something or whether its still telling you about that item/entry that you got 20hrs earlier in the game. Oh and if you're an achievement hunter but play keyboard and mouse - get a controller because keeping the nomad airborne for 30 seconds is nigh on impossible due to the workaround you need to even attempt it on keyboard and mouse because this game LOVES to drop inputs constantly.

All in all, its not actually a terrible game, I wouldn't even say its a bad game. It's just disappointing; and not just comparatively to Mass Effect 1,2 and 3, but because it seems like they got lazy with aspects of the game, or more than likely, devs were being rushed to push a game that wasn't quite ready to be released, and then was abandoned without fixes.",1695174937,1695175059,False,23,2,0.676316618919372559,0,True,False,False

People have comfort food, ME Trilogy was the comfort game for me. They were the games that kept me sane back then, and believe me I was in an extremely dark place. When they announced the ME: Andromeda I was bouncing off the walls with happiness. I still get chills while watching the announcement trailer tbh.

Then the game came out. It was buggy sure. But the media trashed the game so hard that all we have right now is v1.10. They fixed most of the bugs and they cut the support for it and I AM STILL FRIGGIN FURIOUS ABOUT IT.

I couldn't play the game when it came out so I do not really know how buggy it was on launch but had the chance to play it like 4-6 months later. I've played many games since I played Andromeda for the first time, and naturally, had my fair share of incomplete & buggy games. Was it buggy when I played it? Sure it was. But it sure as hell wasn't as buggy as, say, CP2077. I'm sure that so many of us can name worse examples. Why the media and the fanbase back then slandered this game so much I still cannot understand. Sure face animations were weird and AI was a bit wonky(Rumor is they had 18 months to make & carry the game from Unreal to goddamn Frostbite engine and it was rushed), but tbh I didn't think it was that bad back then and after playing it again here (played on X-One for the first time). If some godawful buggy-as-hell games -one named above- faced the same reaction as this game, for sure we wouldn't have them around now. This, by the way, was the case for the branch that developed this game. This was EA's fault for rushing, as was the case with Anthem -I was in all the betas for that one, and even though the testing was AWFUL, they published the game anyway and where is Anthem now?

If you are expecting the same grandeur of ME Trilogy from this game, you'll surely be disappointed. I wasn't, because I wasn't expecting the first game of a possibly new Trilogy to surpass Shepard's Legacy right away. The story is somewhere between mediocre and good, definitely not bad. Not all of the companions are as good and remarkable as their predecessors. The combat? The combat is FUN. AS. HELL. Still one of my favourite combat styles in these types of games. The banter between companions? As beautiful as any other Bioware classic to me. 

I remember people complaining about repeated fetch/scan quests and maps being ""too big and empty"". I hope the same people kept complaining about the same things for some of the other games that have been praised (not gonna name the games. Though I'm sure some of you guessed my top 3 beautiful yet ""wth is wrong with you? The map is huge"" games) There are 5 or 6 planets you really discover and some small mission-bound relatively small-linear maps. I've finished every single quest that has a quest mark (and only have a couple -like around 10- quests that don't have any) left at the end, 100% all the planets, and it took me less than 50 hours on normal difficulty. HOW WAS THAT MASSIVE? Yes, some parts of the maps were quite empty, but tbh I didn't mind listening to the hilarious & amazing banter of my companions while driving around with Nomad.

You can see that they've planned so many things for DLCs or future games, and I am still fuming while thinking about all those things that'll always stay as a loose end. I am still angry about the Quarian arc that I'll never be able to play, ever. I blame EA and toxic media & toxic fanbase for the failure of this game. This wasn't a perfect game, but it definitely didn't deserve to be shut down like this.

Definitely worth grabbing on sale. If you enjoyed the ME Trilogy and will not compare this separate story with that legend, you'll enjoy the game a lot.",1695137048,1695143294,True,35,0,0.749500751495361328,0,True,False,False

[h3]Total Playthrough Time: 150 Hrs, <2 Hrs in MP

Total Completion: 100%[/h3]

I failed to finish Andromeda when it launched on console many years ago.  The bugs were too pervasive, and I had multiple quests simply fail to flag properly, leaving them in eternal purgatory.  I disgustedly dropped it about 30 hours in - so about a third through the game.

After returning many years later, with a high-spec PC and a slew of Frosty mods in tow, I have successfully slugged my way through it.  

Let's get the obvious out of the way - don't play this game unless you are a true die hard Mass Effect fan, as I was at one time.  Don't even think about it.  If ""die-hard"" does describe you, though, frankly, I'd still not recommend it- but if you are a stubborn bastard like I am and must, mods are absolutely essential.  I can confidently say that NexusMods' major bug/quest fixes, QoL tweaks, face texture overhauls and traversal improvements carried me to the end of the game.  

Anyway, let's get into the details.

The writing is detestable and is really what sinks this game from the start. Pretty much none of the major questions the game posits at its beginning are answered in any fashion - the only ""answer"" we are given is to a question no one was asking - [spoiler]the nature of the Angara and life in Heleus[/spoiler]. We, the irritating crew of the knock-off Normandy, are whisked away to a magical McGuffin that will, of course, do exactly what we expected (and spoiler, [spoiler]it does[/spoiler]). My God, the ****er really does say ""We are All Pathfinders"" unironically as the last line before credits roll. How this got through any sort of quality control is completely beyond me.

The characters are unlikable, one-dimensional and juvenile, save for a few like Natalie Dormer's asari doctor and Jaal.  I often paused the game out of sheer malice for them. It is a shocking step down from the OT. I never felt any need to learn about my crewmates, the Nexus staff, or any of the NPCs. How the characters themselves are written is totally irredeemable, and is certainly tailored towards """"""modern audiences"""""" for all the wrong reasons.  

The Kett are a disappointingly generic and boring antagonist, borrowing extremely heavily from The Collectors' motifs, with zero dynamism or intrigue to their ""conquest"". Story arcs are just abandoned for dozens of hours, some major narrative elements make absolutely no sense whatsoever, and pretty much every ""revelation"" about the Heleus Cluster hits with a wet ""splat"".  Overall, the narrative is just a huge disappointment from top to bottom.

Andromeda is a colossal open-world game, for some unfathomable reason.  Naturally, Bioware couldn't even get the open-world BS that they've aped from Ubisoft right.  The open world activities are a bore, and while they profile as expanded versions of ME1's Exploration missions, there's basically zero evolution, and in fact some devolution, to that concept. There simply is a suffocatingly vacuous mundanity at the heart of this game. The atmosphere is stale, the objectives are boring, and there's zero incentive to explore.  It's a huge failure in a game so beholden to its open world structure.  

The leveling, inventory system and economy are all useless, unbalanced and easily exploited - for instance, once you figure out how essential Augmentations are in build crafting, every weapon you find on the ground becomes worthless clutter.  Exploration via the Galaxy Map to ""secondary"" star systems are useless resource-grabbing endeavors, as there are zero missions outside of the designated hub worlds.

The combat is depressingly shallow. There's no power wheel or squad power commands, effectively removing any RPG gameplay elements from enemy encounters. This is still just as stupid a design decision as when I played it last - it feels like a cheap 3rd person shooter. I felt as if I'm not the commander of my team and that upgrading my squad is a waste of time. The cover system, which intends to use a Last of Us-like auto cover rather than a button press, feels floaty and clunky. And the ""enhanced mobility"" is imprecise and very buggy.

How about those internet-famous bugs?  Even on Patch 1.10 and with about a dozen Frosty Mod fixes, I couldn't escape - the game is absolutely rife with them. I can only list a few, for brevity's sake - wildlife just spawning right out of the sky and dropping in front of you, conversations just completely breaking mid-dialogue, non-conversation environmental dialogue lines overlapping (EXTREMELY annoying), NPCs in hubs teleporting at warp speed to another end of the hub, enemies just standing still when shooting them, enemies in the open world disappearing completely right in front of your eyes, holes in the terrain that can be fallen through both on foot and in the Nomad, combos not working, broken AI, mods on weapons not working... etc. You get the idea. By far the buggiest game I've ever played. I averaged about 3-4 annoying bugs a play session.

The AI is ruthlessly stupid. Considerably worse than the OT in pretty much every respect, which is just totally unacceptable. Squadmates will just wander right into combat for no reason, and will often just stand on top of cover or stand completely still. The whole squad command system is irreparable and non-functional. As for the enemies, they simply line up to be shot or play pop-and-hide behind one piece of cover. That's it. They are totally uninteresting to fight, and make long missions a slog.

The game is very poorly optimized, particularly with heavy particle effects, as is customary with modern Frostbite games.  The Afterburner readouts from this game are some of the most puzzling I've ever seen - highly detailed long-reaching scenery with LODs can be running comfortably, while a small, unlit corner of a room can max out your GPU.  The engine itself also has a crazy amount of problems that don't even manifest on an Afterburner readout, like major traversal stutter and a strange small camera hitch when aiming with a controller.  A VRR screen is highly recommended to iron out the inevitable GPU-related drops. It took a mammoth machine (3080 Ti) to really get an acceptable 100 FPS out of this game at ~1550p.  Which is absurd, considering it released 6 years ago.  Oh, and the sound stage is poor, particularly in 7-channel surround configuration.

What's too bad is that there are redeeming qualities here. By all accounts, Frostbite 2.0 was a difficult engine to wrap a game around, but I see why it was demanded - the environments can be visually stunning. The combat is dumb and lacks tactical depth, but some of the finer details have merit and could have use in a proper ME game.  The powers feel good and look spectacular at times, and the combo system, while buggy, is an impressive step up from the trilogy.  

There's no escaping the reality, though, that Mass Effect: Andromeda is an inexcusably poor effort from top to bottom. EA pulled all support mere weeks after release, and swept the entire franchise right under the rug as soon as they could.  And within a few months, N7 Day became a footnote and the franchise went silent - which it is to this very day, save for a minor teaser for a potential reboot/sequel that honestly may never see the light of day.  It was, and still is, a black mark on EA's publishing record and is unquestionably an embarrassment for the franchise.  Unless you're a die-hard and a masochist, stay far away.

- Main antagonist's whole character is not at all intimidating as you'd want or expect 
- The weirdest choice of animation for a krogan fist fight you'll ever see
- Some interactions have a frustratingly little amount of choice you can do e.g. you see two people looting someone they've very clearly murdered in the back alley of this town and literally all you can do is either walk away or say ""stealing is wrong"" and get dismissed anyway. STUPID.
- Textures on character models for whatever reason will look fine sometimes then scarily low poly other times    
- There's a few side mission bugs that will most definitely never get fixed 

Pros:
- Genuinely a fun experience, driving around in particular is more satisfying than expected 
- Companion characters are great, Drack especially 
- Combat feels more fun and dynamic compared to the original trilogy (at least from how i remember it)

On the fence: 
- There seem to be very few actual consequences for choices in most missions and its more about tailoring your character; which I can see why some would not like but personally I prefer since I'm the type to constantly look up wiki's to make sure I don't butterfly effect myself to a bad ending; this way I can play more carefree about how endings will be affected.    
- Certainly different feel of game from the original mass effect trilogy but I think that's kind of the point; I feel it unfair that half of the hate for this game uses that point as its baseline.",1694608637,1694608637,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

But overall a fun game with a solid story. Good controls, great shooting/combat, mostly good voice acting, great graphics, awesome story and nice dialogue choices. although i feel many choices were shallow and didn't feel as impactful or as meaningful as the mass effect trilogy. Still enjoyable, though. 

But Sadly some woke political stuff really hurt it in a lot of areas, and even outright savaged some of the previously established lore, which was just annoying. I hate when political agendas (from either wing) are crammed into games. ESPECIALLY when it destroys and ignores lore to do so. That was highly disappointing. Ngl.

like making a female krogan the warlord. Literally goes against the entire krogan lore established in the trilogy. in fact almost every leader is ME:A is a female in the game. I don't know if theres a single white guy at all, besides the main character if you choose him as such. Most of the female characters are great, dont get me wrong. Love cora, vetra, peebee, jein, addison etc...., but many stand out as blatant political agenda (morta, sloan etc..). which sucks. It just took away from the quality of the game (as you can tell many were crammed in last minute and thus animation and voice acting was sloppy and unpolished. Like they swapped it last minute just to replace a male leader with a female one because some in-house anita sarkeesian demanded they do so) which just hurt the game and hurt immersion. But its still fun and it far from ruins the game. So id recommend if you're a ME fan like me. Was still thoroughly enjoyable.

I decided to give it 2 hours of my time to see if it's any good. 

Graphics: 
While it looks better than previous games and game runs fine on Linux, but I just can't get over how characters look. 
Even compared to mass effect 1, they look much worse, because there is something from ""uncanny valley"" in them. I can't really pinpoint why I think they look bad, but it's hard to ignore and facial animations are also disappointment. 

Combat:
I heard that combat is the strongest point, but I not necessary agree with it. On mouse + keyboard the movement is not as good as in previous games. You loose ability to for tactical pause, can't command your team what abilities or weapon they use. The arenas also seem bigger, which is not necessarily good thing. In one of the starting missions you have to order your characters to stand on the opposite sides of the platform. Then while defending you have to run from one side of the platform to the other side and help them from waves of enemies. Experience like this give the impression that you are not in a team, but instead you have to babysit your npc colleagues and keep them alive. 
Maybe it gets a little bit better later, I don't know. In 2 hours I did not like what I see. 
Jetpack and shooting is cool i guess. 

Characters: 
Obviously, 2 hours it not enough to get to know the characters, but even in the first 2 hours you can have ""WTF are they talking about"" moment. 

Summary:
I didn't like combat. Reading other reviews, it looks like story and characters are not the strongest points of this game. 
It definitely is not mass effect and probably shouldn't be called as one. 
If you want to play game in science fiction setting, I think it's good idea to buy this game on sale, try it out for 2 hours to see if you like combat and refund if not. 
For mass effect fans it's hard pass.

Combat mechanics are slimmed down. Crafting pointless. Main story line is too bloody short. Added loads of small delays (space traveling takes 1+ minutes both system to system and planet to planet)

this game was clearly designed for console and not for a PC. 
Meaning i only get 3 active skills... Well this is why i actually did choose to play weapon focused class instead of biotic ones. 
The dream is Mass Effect games is always to play OP Biotic powered character like they make out NPC's in cinematics. But reality is in any Mass Effect games, you still use weapon a lot even if you are biotic. 
But here since i get only 3 active skills, i would never feel like true biotic super power, like cinematics. Woudl only use 2 skills - one to prime, other to detonate, and then use pistol till CD refreshes. 3rd, utility or deffensive. 
So do not play with Mouse and Keyboard like pro gamer, but play with controller like a noob : ) 

Story is ok but has many places to fix. 
1) the end is underclimitic. We end of note that, now i can really explore the cluster. But i have explored everything already, so what is left to do? The real ""the end"" to story is missing. Probably plan is to continue story in next game. But it is done in a bad way. 
2) we get a lot of emails (in game) that has no real point. I have read 100+ useless emails and 50+ i have just skipped over, cause, whats the point. 
ALso issue is how these emails are delivered. Before mission, i check, there are none. you return from mission and go straight to email console and there are 20+.
3) many things in story are left unresolved. This means the game should not be played as stand alone, but as part of next game releases, which are not necessarily going to be released. 
4) the movie night side quest chain was complacently pointless. At start it did make sense. But  it came to conclusion where it made no sense story wise. Also part of story that lead to it, was ignored. So bad design with too much effort. 
5) romance in start of game felt unnatural. The progression happens only after main quest. But main quest line is short. The side quests are 5times longer. So for most game it was just ""I like you / I like you back"". And no possibility to advance it or see where we stand. 
And on top of that  there is other companion that i am supposed to be involved with as every conversation has option to make out with him/her. So i can not progress story line i want but i am constantly bugged about other i do not want... Bad design. 
6) in start of game i am supposed to answer personal questions about my family (father, mother or sister/brother) but i do not know that since i was not briefed on the background.. So what should i answer? Some hint was required that here i was supposed to make up background. After all this is role-playing-game and i am not sure what my role is yet...
7) do not give a good impression on how time flows in game... It feels like i am running from crisis to crisis and then reporter ask how do i relax in game. And there is no option that i run from crisis to crisis, but are some lame options. If story wise my character has down time, tell or show me about it. Otherwise my character has no downtime at all...
During Mass Effect 3 story at least i was told my character has slept on 3 nights only, thus giving some impression on time-line. Here, nothing... no option top relax, but there was supposed to be some. 
8) Often i go on mission. I take 2 of my squad members with me. and 4 are sitting on their asses back on ship. Even if there is story reason for everyone to go on mission. THAT IS BAD. 
Also sometimes in midd mission new info comes up that would justify sending 2 of my companions to deal with that. But nop - i am not allowed to split up my party. It is too damn limiting and bad design if game wants to be a STORY DRIVEN GAME!

Quest delivery is somewhat bad. 
Most of time you get no planet to 1 and half planets to explore. Then at one point you are given 3 planets to explore at once and shitload of side quests. All side quests are minor non-story quests. And it might feel too overwhelming when done this way., A head developer should have cut many of those stories or re-did their delivery to be more lineal. 
There should always be the planet you explore and the next planet (from main quest line point of view). No more, no less. 
Also after last explored planet you start to get these small go there - go back type of quests one by one. 
It really makes me feel that many things in game were added or prolonged just to reach the goal of game being X hour long. 

Items and resources
In whole game i had never found any lack of resources. In start i might be short but by end i had more cash i can spend, enough research data to research everything And so much carting materials that i could try every weapon / armor in game. With such overflow of resources there was no point to introduce any of them. It should be either chose of what you get (but not all) or it is free to get. This was added as afterthought and not in a good way. 
All game i used same starting armor i got at start of game. Just replaced for final mission to be more DPS focused. But that did not really matter. Need for new armor should have been greater. Also i was unable to find a good helmet i wanted to use (was either so-so stats or looked ok). Only 1 or 2 helmets might pass for OK looking... 
Pretty early found my best sniper rifle schematic, never cared for any other weapon after. If would have played non-sniper, there was nice pistol but not sure i liked any other weapon. Many weapons are so underpowered that i do not consider them usable at all. 

In many situations i encountered that same character model was used multiple times. I meet new person  and it looks like 1 or 2 people i have met before. It makes this game feel cheap. 
And Angara even has no facial features that makes them apart, just some color different. 
Also Suri, who is my Chief Science Officer moonlighted on Ark Hyperion med-bay as nurse. 
Repeat using random NPC models might be forgivable, but not using main character models...

I did play as sniper. Infiltrator profile, and that is like playing with cheats. Have most powerful sniper rifle with best penetration mod possible, and then scope your enemy heads in next room before you open doors ; ) 
You clear entire rooms before any teammate open fire or anyone takes a shot. Then when you enter room you get no opposition but teammates shout that opposition is heavy : ) Simply nice. 

Planet scanning is slow and tiresome job with little point. Mining on planet is so badly made and useless that i have stopped doing that after 2nd planet. 

Planets to explore were too few. Wished that they would have prepared more planets, cause that is the purpose of this game - to explore. 

If you play i recommend Drack and Peebee combo - best conversations ever. Most fun characters. When you get Jaal there is story reason to use him every time, but his conversation seemed dull to me.

Lastly, why this game is about humans? Nothing story wise requires that i play with humans. Might as well been Assari. or any other council race. But for some reason i was locked in mostly human team and human focused story. 
I really wish Mass Effect would give option to play as Krogan or Salarians (the 2 best races in universe)",1694437770,1694453160,False,3,1,0.48849150538444519,0,True,False,False

Also how is it that ME Andromeda's graphics could be worse than the original ME trilogy's? How is it that we can have quick save in ME trilogy but not Andromeda during priority missions?

Plot premise is flimsy. I find it hard to believe that characters will fly 25 million light years, stay in cryo for 600 years to find settlement when throughout the ME trilogy, there were so many fringe worlds to settle in and cultivate. Worse, the first alien race they find is a bipedal humanoid race that speaks language and has a gun invention/culture.

But despite that, certain portions of the game felt fresh and enjoyable. For example, the new dialogue system based on tone, the scanning used in exploration, firing off multiple powers in succession, story telling isn't that bad, and controversially, teammates being able to hold their own though they cannot be controlled. But despite these, this game is mired by a big step back in terms of UI, graphics, and other clunky designs.

All in all, the exploration vibes are ok (not guns blazing all the way), not a fantastic game, but it is ok to play a little, without all the sidequests padding, to enjoy a little adventure in space. Buy only at a steep discount. Like 90-95% steep.

you know what is worse than the mako? The nomad. Yes, the nomad is absolutely terrible in handling, cant navigate gentle slopes and cant jump more than 1m in height. It is giving me terrible motion sickness.

I have one lesson to learn.
Make up your own thoughts. There is no consensus about Andromeda. 
A lot enjoy it. The first wave was dissapointed. But the first wave is over.

I love it. Sure it is a bit senile and infantile at times. 
But man. The greatness outshines the mediocre bits.
I really don't get why this game was shelved and on sale for 10 bucks. This game is worth way more.
But sometimes it calls me Sara while i changed my characters first name, that is weird.
I tell myself it's her maiden name. Which makes no sense. 
Hence the complaints for Andromeda.

What stands out are:
- The worlds
- The detail (you can log in to a chat all crew share, very nice to read. Your A.i. tries to tell jokes. And you can ask for them. The discussions between crew members etc A little glimpse of the enormous detail in this game)
- the fighting
- the atmosphere.
- The conversations.

Sorry haters and advocates of the original. This game truly is a gem. And it deserved a lot more than this continuous battering of the little problems it has. Yes the writing sometimes is bad. But the emphasis lies not always on the writing of dialogue (animations and other annoyances were fixed) . I merely thought with some lines. Well i don't understand this haracter and moved on.. And be done with it. The overall writing is quite good actually. I once heard a reviewer tell us that the planet description is sub-par. ... Really... I don't see any difference witht he original trilogy. This is just battering without justification. 
What annoys me is that sometimes reviewers with a lot of words can slip in a lot of their own beliefs without being anywhere close to what is actual gameplay. 
The overall story, and lines and quests are fun. The world is beautiful. The quests so far are interesting.
I also saw a reviewer, that told us, the world, that the game is not about exploration. Excuse me???
What the hrell do you mean? The ffirst world you go to has 6 (!) optional quests. And they will all be mentioned in your journal. No exploration?? This 'lack' of exploration continues throughout the whole game i've heard, so be ready to be 'bored'. (with this guys channel)
They are not Mass effect trilogy fun. But not all fun is the same now
 is it. Fun is fun because it is new. This is a new take on the Mass Effect Universe, and a clever one.

As a metaphor. Not all Starwars movies are the best. But they sure all are a lot of fun to watch.
And Andromeda is like a Starwars movie. Not the best.. But a hell of a lot of fun. And very rewatchable.
On some points it is even better than the trilogy. F.I. the open world is fantastic. Also, it is huge.
Give this game a go. It is a steal.
The haters won the first round. Let's show Bioware that Andromeda is not the terrible game all of us are forced upon believing to be the case. For it is not the case. It is a very good game. 

The ONLY thing i have seen so far that is a miss?
Some lines in the dialogue. That's it.
Kudos haters for destroying a reboot over some lines of dialogue.
(The rest is fixed)

Let me tell you one thing: I stopped playing the original trilogy, that i just started replaying, because Andromeda was on sale.
I haven't returned to Shepherd. I'll stick with Rhyder. It's that bloody good.
I went from mission, to exposition, to expanding relations (which you can track in your p.a.) 
Layers my friend, layers upon layers. And it is all connected in a less obvious way than the originals.

Two things though.
- Music is absent on critical moments. (The original gave you a sense of scope and urgency by music. This game is silent, apart from some atmospheric sounds)
- Conversation seems taken on with an axe : ""parents. didn't live long. Seen better places since then. Wanted father to be proud."" Some conversations seem to be made of parts. So it seems robotic at times.

Listen ME fans. This one is a bit more teenage than the others. But that is ok  within the story. You are distant with your dad, and you are the only Rhyder in the situation to follow him. So everyone is not where they supposed to be. It is a completely other take than the other games. 
Which is a very good premise for a story. It is not the OLD Me story. But it is within the Universe.
And it is good. It is fine.
I sometimes compare Bioware fans to Metallica fans.
The centre of fandom is NOT allowed to do anything else than what is expected.
And if you do, we will ruin you.

Andromeda is a terrific game.
BUY it.. 
Show Bioware this was worth doing. Except for some humanity within the lines of dialogue, which was missing. A little obvious follow up from emotional bonding.

One other complaint i heard.
The camera work is not like the original...
- I have seen every companion pace the same pace in every conversation in the trilogy. I never heard you complain. That was groundbreaking. And to not show that corners should be cut somewhere, is a fault suddenly. I litterly saw Wrex, Tali, every one of them pace the same pace.

I may not swear on Steam. But imagine a guy being so mad that his favourite franchise got rebooted, and he loves it to heart. He's wish he wrote it. And he hates the fact that he was not around to pay the full 60 dollars for the game. Because he knows the difficulty of imagining something and it not being fruitious. As a consumer of ME and as a writer of little Scifi books the market is killing. A good idea hardly ever comes to life. The majority lets you know what they want. It reminds me of my favouriute drink being removed, because the sales were low. I honestly think that the negative marketing got to me as well. And as a ME fan. I should have bought it earlier,  because in hindsight i ff'in LOVE Andromeda.
Oh yeah... One last point about the transitions between planets.
I am sure that as a 8 year old you would have loved the  different transitions bwteen the planets. I as a 43 year old does. I watch them all. There is  another problem happening with sci fi.  You all expect gun blazing perfect heroes. Thhat is not sci-fi. Because you lose the fact that everything outside of you is alien and/or friendly. You think you are the bad-ass. Well you are NOT. You are terrified, you are laden with responsibillities. You are fokked, as english say. But back to the 'long transitions' complaint. They 'FIXED' it.
For anyone who doesn't like sci-fi.
Yes, they fixed it, for the people who  don't mind the genre but want to get to the top of the food-chain as fast as possible.And all these people have is a ruined franchise and  their ego to boost. Sounds a bit like EA.

(Too bad EA interferes with Bioware with DRM and a log-in. But that's EA (Eternal Aholes)
EA are like the Borg. Assimiliating all that is good. And in the end, we are all the same or dead.

Having played the original three games countless times, it was disappointing to see the backlash this game got when it came out. Thus, I've stayed away from it as well, due to it seemingly having little to do with the original ME background.

Game went on sale at some point, thought I'd buy it, even if only for the sake of getting into the old universe again and to be frank - I was pleasantly surprised.

On the positive side, the game is packed with content, side-missions, dialogue, old and new skills, crafting, research, exploring planets that are surprisingly large in your old trusty Nomand, ton of new lore. On its own, gameplay-wise, it's a quality. However, on the downside, despite the later delivered fixes for facial animations, these are still really lackluster even for a 2017 release, nevermind the odd saving system and multiplayer still being essentially what it was in ME3 but somehow feels like it's ""less"", since ME3 MP was great.

Overall, if you simply enjoy space games, exploration, atmospheric gameplay, taking in the lore and the whole theme of the game and the sci-fi element that comes with it, this game would still be a great choice. But if you've played the ME trilogy and expect this to be the same, or even better, you would be mistaken.

Still, as a ME fan, I've enjoyed it quite a lot, despite all of the above. It's however debatable whether the full price of 40€ is justifiable.

The game's storytelling feels stale. For instance, Mass Effect 1-3 featured a commendable range of facial expressions and body language, whereas most interactions in this game present characters with identical poses and facial expressions. For example, when you rescue someone from the brink of death and the interaction begins, they maintain a poker-faced demeanor, showing no emotion for what has just transpired.

While attempting to emulate its predecessor, this game sought to expand the open-world sections of Mass Effect significantly, perhaps to tap into the open-world trend. However, the storytelling within these open-world segments feels sluggish and uninteresting. One of the key strengths of Mass Effect 1-3 was the inclusion of compact open-world environments that conveyed a sense of freedom while still following a comfortably linear narrative path.

Furthermore, the dialogue options available in this game felt rather lackluster, lacking the tension and profound emotions one would hope for.

Consequently, this dynamic influences the development of characters. The desire to learn more about your squad-mates and side characters diminishes when they all convey similar tones, exhibit identical expressions, and fail to react to developments that should directly impact them.

You can customize your character in great detail. 
There is an extraordinary variety of planets for you to explore.
The interaction with the creatures is not as varied as in the trilogy, but it's enough, I'd say.
The graphics are really pleasant to watch. 

This time the missions were divided into different sections which I quite liked. But somehow when I was playing I started doing multiple missions at once, which confused me.
I did this because I wanted to finish all the missions on one planet before moving to the next and I didn't feel like looking at the cut scene of how the ship is taking off or landing on a planet. Yeah sure it is pretty cool but seeing it all the time... it gets boring to me really fast. I think it should be skippable if you like. Like moving to different planets. That also applies to traveling between different systems.
I wouldn't say I liked the extra missions you can do. They are not my thing. But if you really like searching for things or dealing with others' problems you may like it.

The Combat system isn't something special, it is more advanced than before. You have a jetpack that helps you to doge the enemy or climb over something. Also, you can maneuver with it. The enemy fight is really repetitive because you fight the same enemies on every planet.

Here you have a research and development system that you can use to build better equipment, weapons, and armor. I really like it. 

But there you have A.V.P points. I understand that they are meant to help you with resources but I really don't see almost any benefits at all.
When you unlock the perks that give you resources in a defined time. You have to manually go to your ship watch all the cut scenes then press the button to collect them and spam ""space"" to skip all the notifications that you have received something. The things you received are so few that It doesn't matter whether you collect them or not.
And to be honest, at some point, I even forgot that this thing existed.

The multiplayer mod is another minus for me. I don't like this mod at all. You are supposed to play with other players and defend yourself from enemies who come in waves. It is boring and not worth it.

I forgot to mention that in some places you will have FPS drops.

I experienced something strange. When you shift+tab to open Steam overlay and come back to the game you can't move at all, only look around with The Windows cursor is in the middle of the screen but you can press ESC to save the game. The only solution for me was to restart the game. 

There is no photo mode. That is another minus for me.

I think the game overall is great and it is worth taking it on a sale. Although you don't need to play the previous games it will be better to play the trilogy before this.

People were too hard on this game. Back in 2017 we still believed that AAA developers were going to make RPGs for some reason. That hasn't really been the case since then, and things are only now starting back up six years after this game dropped.
I enjoyed this game just as much as any other Mass Effect entry. It sucks that we probably won't get to see much of its story anymore. Thanks for nothing, gaming media in 2017.

There are other alien races to discover and interact with and narrative choices to make which affects whether they become your allies. 

The game starts slow with lot of quests given early on from different NPCs. But once you take time to explore each of the planets with different biomes, it become enjoyable. The basic premise is that you need to explore various planets ad help alien races there and try to befriend them and activate some atmosphere purifier monoliths to make planets inhabitable. When the planet viability reaches 100% by doing sorts of activities, Earthlings and other alien races can then settle in that planet and continue their research on available resources and make it suitable for sustaining life. The gameplay loop revolves around this and more quests open up on each planet. 

We can choose 2 companions from a roster which adds more characters further, who can assist in combat. They also provides some special quests which helps to learn more of their backstory and flesh out their characters. By the end of the game, got really fond of some of the companions. The dialogues are also well written.

Combat is standard cover based 3rd person shooter with some special abilities kind of similar to magic spells in other Action RPGs with different elements and also Biotic abilities similar to a telekinesis, which keeps combat encounters interesting and enjoyable.

I had always held off due to the poor reviews, despite my love for the original mass effect trilogy.  But figured for 10 bucks, it was worth a shot.  And... I can honestly say, yeah, it's not that great.  I feel like the story itself is fine and had potential, but the implementation is poor, especially in comparison to the trilogy.  

The voice acting often falls flat.  Delivery of diolog often feels forced. The way dialog flows is often poor between characters is often poor.  I'm having a hard time really caring about any of the characters much because of this.  The dialog doesn't have that imagination effect of feeling like they are real people you care about that the previous games did.  It's close... but it's just... off.

Little cut scenes between game play are pretty crappy generally.  The ship maneuvering in ways that don't look real kinda stuff.

Character graphics are at best no better than the much older mass effect games, and in may ways worse.  Strange looking faces and body poses all over the place.  Sometimes poor texturing that looks unfinished.

Animations are subpar.  The way the player's group moves around in combat or moves through world structures and obstacles feels unfinished and cheap.  For example when you draw your weapon, every group member instantly and at the same moment draws their weapon.  Another is weird hopping around elevated areas for no reason.  The way the group moves in combat is just as weird/bad.

After about 20 hours in this game I wouldn't say I've had no fun, but it's not even close to good enough for me to consider doing a future replay or to even finish it once something else catches my attention.  If you want to experience mass effect universe for the first time - play the original trilogy.  If you want to come back and revisit the mass effect universe again - play the original trilogy.

As a whole I liked this game, and found it's plot not as interesting as the original trilogy. I like this game. The idea of expanding into a new galaxy with pre-existing struggles and super alien tech was fun and I liked the species interacting. 

Some of the positives:
-The ability to change combat style with a few credits - kept the combat interesting as I tried different styles
-Andromeda is big, with lots to explore like the ME1
-New characters and crew, and hints towards the OG-3, but no over-reliance on them
-I liked the Kett and how they are Angaran (some of them)
-Unsolved mysteries and world building kinda close to OG trilogy

Now the negatives:
-Only have 3 active powers at any given time is crazy restrictive and frustrating when you have so many points to invest. Even one more would've made combat more interesting
-Liam... I did not like his character at all, who ever wrote that character needs to find another job
-There are SO MANY SIDE QUESTS... yes the OG trilogy was packed full of them too, but those games I could knock out 95-100% of them and still finish in 60 hours gameplay/game... this game took me 100 hours to do 90% of them... and you have to go to six different planets for some of them which is just a lot of load/travel time. I enjoyed the side quest in the OG because they felt important to world building, and only mildly a slog, but here half of them were just fetch-quests with minimal addition to the galaxy
-The plot hole of how can they jump systems in this galaxy so easily without mass relays? They launched before ME3 in this timeline, so how did they develop the tech when the Relays hadn't been destroyed yet in the MIlky Way?? I never really saw this explained anywhere... maybe in the codex but I didn't dig for it


At the end of the day I recommend this game because I like the unique take and universe expansion of this game. Plus I would like to see several of the unfinished plot lines (intended for next installment) to play out, like the ""Benefactor"", Kett council, Quarian Ark, scourge/remnant origins.

The main problem with this game is that it's not Mass Effect. To truly enjoy this game, you must distance yourself from the idea that it is part of the Mass Effect series. Because compelling and alive story is what makes Mass Effect great. Andromeda on the other hand feels like it was more focused on exploration and combat. Also why is the game giving me 4 options in conversation, which each one is anchored to behavior pattern, but I feel like it does not matter at all which one I choose. It just plays different line od dialog and then continues same. In fact any decisions made in the game felt like it had no consequences which goes back to the point that it does not feel like Mass Effect

The visuals and sounds effects are impressive (except of humans).
Upon landing on different planets, you can appreciate the effort invested in their design. Unfortunately, this effort is primarily visible on the visual front. Because the gameplay can get a bit repetetive. Each planet has environmental hazards which works uniformly, whether it is radiation, cold or poison, it is just a bar which slowly decreasses.

Also I hate the guy who came up with lets make 10 levels for each weapon. Because why would I want to craft same weapon 10 times just to upgrade it a bit. There are really fun choices you can make when creating guns which can alter the gun alot. This causes limitations in resources, which terminates any experimantion leaving you wondering, what could this mode do on this gun.

Combat feels satisfactory except the archons, where he has ball circling around him so you shoot it, when its destroyed you shoot the archon then repeat. If you play on harder difficulty its boring since its quite large health pools. Abilites are fun to use but I feel really limited by being able to have just 3 on my action bar. I would prefer to have atleast 5 abilites with bit longer CD so I can try to mix them more using the combo system.

It's a decent game if your pc can handle it.  My old pc couldn't, despite playing newer games with better graphics at higher fps, so I gave up on this game for a while.  My new pc runs very smooth, and I haven't had an performance issues since.

I've changed my review to ""Yes"" because, despite its glaring issues, it's actually been rather fun exploring Andromeda. The combat is fairly good when modded, though still not as good as predecessors. I found myself liking some of the characters' personalities and disliking others, as it should be.  I'm not finished with the game, but so far I haven't really found any of the women all that attractive except Suvi, and she's not interested in men. I mean Sarah is kinda cute in a way, but she's also your sister (or yourself). There are mods that somewhat address this, but not entirely. Your RI choice will most likely be entirely personality-based, which... may have been the goal, come to think of it. 

The new races added in this game are decently interesting. Kett are, without giving anything away, analogous in their ideology to a certain race in Star Trek. IYKYK. It isn't bad. Just is what it is. Angarans seem to be favored by the current writers, which makes sense being their addition to the universe, but makes them seem a little silly at times. They wear their emotions on their sleeves, yet they make naturally adept poker players?  What? I wasn't aware showing your true emotions was a boon in poker, but okay. Otherwise, they're fairly interesting, and their eyes are mesmerizing. Just their eyes. I will never be able to unsee a shirtless Angaran. You've been warned. I guess it's more realistic than sexy aliens, but it seems pretty off-brand for Mass Effect.

The story is just straight up forgettable midway through, and it's also boring as hell. Side characters? Bland and uninterresting, out of 6 companions maybe 2 of them are somewhat enjoyable.
And finaly, the animations. After so many years and so many patches, they still look awful. The facial expressions are either totaly emotionless or unnatural as hell, which ruins the feeling for many dialogues and cutscenes

Full Review:

As someone who hasn't played the previous entries to the series basically all of Mass Effect I cant exactly compare them,  however to me the story feels meh though thats only my opinion, I do follow the narrative however it wasn't really gripping enough to pull me in if that makes any sense. As for Gameplay it is fun but quite tedious, The Remnant Ruins felt repetitive, upgrade elements like the mods need to be RNG'ed without an actual loot table, you just have to sort of hope and pray that it drops in some mission or another, which sort of Halts progress when your aiming for a build of some sort that relies on certain mods, etc. Dont get me wrong as a game its still pretty damn fun but I can't really say its worth the Full price.",1691494658,1691494658,True,0,0,0.488599330186843872,0,True,False,False

Animace cestování, co dohromady cca 2-3 hodiny celkem zabraly, protože nejdou z nějákého důvodu přeskočit, vedlejší questy hlavně na Voeldu totálně chaotické, ani jsem nevěděl, že nějáký vedlejší quest tam byl a než jsem ho mohl dodělat, smolík, už nemůžeš. Obličeje mě bolí vidět, protože vypadají jak SUCCberg při výslechu kongresem. Ovládání nomáda? Hrůza, nic nevyjel, trysky slabé, výzbroj žádná a zlaté skákavé Mako oproti tomu. Kett, hlavní záporáci? Celkem ok, ale přišli mi hrozně suchý a nedovařený, je sice fajn, že Archon je ""big bad"", ale je to prostě tuctový nerozvinutý záporák, Saren z ME 1 oproti tomu je alespoň dobře napsaný. Remnant ruiny jsou fajn, ale nakonec po Eosu, což je začátek, už to je jen ""meh, tady je další ruina, vystřílej to, vyber bedny a GG. Tvoje posádka je fajn, ale interakce moc není a co se talentů a výzbroje týče, hodně slabé. Oproti ME trilogii to nemá nic, co by mě vedlo k tomu hrát to znova a jiným stylem(jiné talenty, do někoho jiného se zamilovat, atd.). Většina rozhodnutí vlastně žádnou váhu nemají a je to buřt, jestli si vybereš, že zachráníš Kroganské zvědy, či pathfindera Raeku, apod. Románky jsou další bolavé místo, jak je hra uspěchaná, tak na to není moc čas to rozvíjet a přijde mi, že stejně jako v ME, i tady tvůrci snaží tvrdě tlačit peebee jako tu ""jedinou pravou"". Má nejvíc interakce, nejvíc rozvinutý milostný příběh a i když jsem s někým jiným, tak si s ní dávám dvojku v 0 gravitaci... Ok no.A ještě jedna věc, co mě docela štvala.. Hra ti nabízí sama od sebe, že můžeš s mužským Ryderem mít románek s muži z posádky a  ženským Ryderem s ženami. Chápu, že chtějí být ""cool a moderní"", ale... Proč? Často mi to v dialogu bylo skoro vnuceno z nějákého důvodu, přitom to nedávalo v konverzaci smysl... Ale co, nech sa páčí. Jinak docela fajn, že odkazují tu a tam na události ME, hlavně s odemykáním SAMovo paměti(Vetra je nejspíš Sarenovo dcera s nyx btw, menší spoileřík), ale všechno to je utnuté, stejně jako celá hra celkově mi přišlo. Po konci hlavního příběhu se dá pokračovat v toulkách po Haeliusu, ale už je to nuda a nemáš vlastně důvod to dělat. Sice nechali v mnoha ohledech otevřený konec, jenže... Dočkáme se vůbec někdy pokračování?  Přišlo mi to takové...Nedodělané, což je škoda, mohli rozvíjet fajn příběh, ale toho se asi nedočkáme. Ani nevím, jestli bych si to vůbec znova koupil, což vím, že u ME bych udělal, rozhodnutí tě tam můžou pěkně pojebat na konci, parťáci ti můžou umřít(doteď nevím, jak Kasumi zdechla ve dvojce, když jsem její loyality misi udělal, ale whatever) a hra je záživnější. Andromedu asi jen na jedno letní hraní a pak nechat se na ní prášit, protože víc nabídnout nedokaže, což je veliká škoda. Za mě slabé 4/10.

In English:
I am quite disappointed. Although only 64 hours of gameplay... It is clear that it was not made by the same group of people as the ME trilogy...
The travel animations, which together took about 2-3 hours in total, because they can't be skipped for some reason, the side quests especially on the Voeld were totally chaotic, I didn't even know there was a side quest and before you could finish it, you couldn't. The faces hurt to see because they look like SUCCberg during a congressional hearing.
Control of the Nomad vehicle? Horrible to get somewhere with him(you mostly can't), the jets were really weak even with upgrade, no weapons and a jumping Mako is golden compared to that. Kett, the main villains? Quite ok, but I found them terribly dry and unfinished, it's nice that Archon is the ""big bad"", but he's just  one of a dozen undeveloped villains, Saren from ME 1 is at least well written in comparison. Remnant ruins are nice, but eventually after Eos, which is the beginning, it's just ""meh, here's another ruin, shoot it, pick up crates and GG. Your crew is nice, but there's so few interactions and as far as talents and weapons go , not the strongest. Compared to the ME trilogy, there is nothing that would lead me to play it again and in a different style (different talents, fall in love with someone else, etc.). Most of the decisions don't really have any weight and it's pretty much a waste of time to choose to save the Krogan scouts, or the pathfinder Raek, etc. Romances are another sore point. As the game is rushed, there is not much time to develop it, and it seems to me that just like in ME, here too the creators try to push peebee hard like the ""only real one""- she has the most interactions, the most developed love story and even if I'm with someone else, I get some action with her in 0 gravity... Ok well. another bothering thing about romances, the game automatically offers you that you can with the male Ryder have an affair with the men of the crew and the female Ryder with the women... I get that they want to be ""cool and progressive"" but... Why? How many times was it almost forced upon me in dialogue for some reason. But whatever, to each his/ her own. One pretty cool thing is, that they refer to ME events here and there, especially with unlocking SAM's memory (Vetra is probably Saren's daughter with nyx btw, minor spoiler), but it's all cut short, just like the rest of the game.. After the end of the main story, you can continue wandering around Haelius, but it's boring and you don't really have a reason to do it.
They did leave the ending open in many ways, but... Will we ever get a sequel? I thought it was kind of...Unfinished, which is a shame, they could have developed a nice story, but we probably won't see that. I don't know if I would even buy it again, which I know I would do in ME, the decisions can really screw you up in the next game or at the end, your partners can die (I still don't know how Kasumi died in the collectors base, when I did her loyalty mission, but whatever) and the game is more lively. Andromeda probably only for one summer play and then let it catch dust, because it can't offer more, which is a big shame. Buy it only at 80% or more discount, not really worth more as it is...

Also, I enjoyed the game, but I will elaborate why I gave it a thumbs-down (it's not what you might think).
SPOILERS AHEAD!!!

Pros:
- Beautiful environment, great level design (not too big, not too small, for an Open World game)
- Continuity (somewhat) of the Mass Effect story/universe
- Enjoyable character interactions (most of the time)
- Fluidity of combat and abilities
- Platforming and navigation (the new vehicle rocks!)
- Non-woke story or MC (with some minor exceptions)

Cons:
- Somewhat linear story-development (feels above average as a stand-alone and sub-mediocre as a Mass Effect game, due to the high standards set by the original trilogy)
- Non-emulative and forgettable characters (a lot of times, due to bad facial animations and redundant personality traits and badly written reactions to situations)
- Too soon / Too fast - Story elements that are originally wrapped in mystery are too quickly brushed under the rug or concluded with dull explanations. EX: Remnants: ancient machine tech race created by a sentient precursor race that were basically tasked with seeding worlds with life. THE END. The kett... mysterious militaristic race with expansionist agenda... religious zealots with a leader that went too far (whatever that means for them). THE END. The game's biggest mysteries are concluded with the most linear explanations possible, a far-cry from the mind-boggling Reapers from ME trilogy, whose motivation and agenda you literally find out mere moments before the end.
- Lack of understanding of their own universe (on behalf of the studio). Every particular ""alien"" element from the ME Trilogy that gave nuance and character to each of the Galaxy's species is mostly gone in Andromeda. With the exception of some characters, most of them feel, act and talk like humans in alien suits. Assari no longer have that aura of nobility and absolute perfection about them, Krogan mostly act and talk like confused teens, Turians, the steel-willed soldiers of Milky Way are all over the place and need an ""YOU CAN DO IT"" every two dialogue lines, or else they faint... and Salarians, the hyperactive, twitchy geniuses of Milky Way are now just arrogant, obnoxious and... somewhat smart... sometimes... mostly less than the MC.
- Poorly executed character growth. With a ton of responsibility and expectations dumped on the shoulders of Ryder, that starts off as a somewhat capable young man (or woman) but totally overwhelmed by the situation you would expect this journey to be a trial by fire that slowly forges him/her into a great leader and explorer... but no... the MC mostly acts like their personality juggles between two states of ""I got this"" and ""OH S**T! what are we gonna do, guys!"" with a glimpse of what should have been, towards the end of the story. I understand the lack of hardiness, because we're no longer talking about a military background like Sheppard's, but the MC is by no means a civilian. The MC has had N7 training, with Pathfinder induction training and above average tech and biotic skills. You would expect these traits would be enough to gave the MC a head start in terms of resourcefulness and confidence... but no.
- Addison
- BIGGEST CON and the MAIN REASON why overall I give it a thumbs down, are the technical issues... my god... never before have I seen a game that 100% crashes in certain points of the story progress, during area transitioning. Basically, locking out content for you, at a certain place and time, until you progress further down the line so the game won't crash when you try to land on Nexus to turn in your side quests. This game was released in 2017 and to still have such crucial issues to this day, known and unaddressed, is inexcusable!

In conclusion:
- As a stand-alone game it's ok and can even be fun due to the polished gameplay. (7/10)
- As a Mass Effect game, it falls quite a lot, sub-par even, due to the essence of a Mass Effect game and by the golden standard that was set by the original trilogy (5/10)
- But... the severe technical issues that cannot be avoided give the player an overall horrible experience throughout the game (2/10)

Which brings it to a total of 4.6 out of 10, which is honestly not nearly enough to grade a triple A game with a positive score and review (let alone a Mass Effect game).",1691139301,1691139812,False,2,0,0.50870591402053833,0,True,False,False

It symbolizes and perfectly represents everything wrong with EA and their approach to game production. So lets see here,

The good:
- Um... it didn't crash once? Not a high bar but I can't think of much else.
- Runs relatively well, but anything under ultra settings looks like a blurry mess.

The bad, oh boy:
- This has no right to call itself Mass Effect. It has NO ties with the original trilogy, only vague remarks.
- There's no science fiction here. It's the most generic, uninspired vaguely sci-fi adjacent bs you can imagine.
- Mechanics are isolated, meaning you don't carry tasks as you're doing other things, you'll pick an activity and do something else when that's done. This creates a series of boring gameplay loops with little to recommend.
- The shooting works for the most part but there's nothing to it. No sandbox to the combat, and it's not as snappy as any other cover-shooter. You can only cover and fire from 1 direction btw, clear oversight or they just didn't care.
- The story. OH LORD HAVE MERCY, the story. There's nothing here. The plot is bland and poorly constructed, no drama, no intriguing politics, no difficult questions, no interesting characters, no suspense, no discovery (in a god damn sci-fi) and it boils down to the most absolutely generic, irrelevant info dump, filled to the brim with cringy dialogue and a villain so uninteresting that made me want to press alt-f4 more times than I can count. It is the absolute bottom of the barrel when it comes to originality, believe me when I say I got NOTHING added to my life by experiencing this story, if you can even call it that. I just feel like my time was wasted.
- The entire game as down-time littered throughout. Everything has a long animation that you can't skip, like leaving and landing on zones, initiating dialogue, even WALKING has a delay to it when you change directions. Feels slugish to do anything in the game, down to the minutia.
- on top of down-time, there's some kind of issue that causes a constant input-delay in the whole game. Even in the menus. I've turned off v-sync, played on fullscreen at 120 fps, and still felt like there was about 70ms of input-lag on every key press, mouse included. Don't know what causes it but it's indicative of terrible software design or a bad port. Maybe both.

You know what? I can be here all day, but I've had this pile of garbage waste my time for long enough. Don't buy it, and if anyone you know is curious to play it, advise them against it. Again, I see absolutely no reason to play this, and I regret it even more by trying it fresh out of binging the ME Legendary Edition.

Hot tip - disable V-sync immediately & lock the framerate using the NVidia control panel analogue of your choice. That fixed all of my technical issues (after an hour of googling and annoying framerate issues). I haven't had any game-breaking bugs whatsoever; occasionally people will walk around during conversation cutscenes. 

I feel bad for the people who designed the combat and exploration for this game, which are top-notch. If this hadn't been under the Mass Effect brand, inevitably causing it to be compared to one of the best series of all time, I think it would have been fairly well received (once the bugs were ironed out). Instead, there's a Mass Effect ""flavor"" slapped on top and it's painfully obvious that whoever wrote the dialogue for the earlier games is long gone. The combat is honestly the best in the series, by a fairly large margin, and going around exploring very well-designed planets and shooting aliens is worth the price of admission.",1691021443,1691021443,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is far better than prior games, the mobility and use of the Primer/Detonation (from ME3 MP) makes even inter-party combos. 

The Dialogue has some bad lines, but so did the prior trilogy, and I prefer the freedom that Tone gives me over Morality, yes you cant be a cartoon villain but I no longer have to stick to an overly simplified morality spectrum.

Big Decisions, I agonised more over a late game decision in this game than any of the trilogy, it was a lose lose and I felt bad afterwards... and I know I wouldn't feel better taking the over one. 

Bringing in the Party banter while in the Nomad really makes the characters feel like a crew who live on the same ship.

Due to some idiotic decisions from EA, this game was a mess on release. Some things are still not fixed completely, example: facial animations often look strange, but not as stupid as they were before all fixes.

Pros:
Story - I liked the feeling of setting new colonies, being a pathfinder in an unknown worlds. Twists, choices - present.
Visuals - Game is beautiful and have different planets, with different climate.
Characters - They tried to do the similar thing with characters and crew as in Trilogy, so you can like/hate them, definitely see some personality in each.
Loyalty missions - Most of them are just superb. Some are very funny, some have bits of suspence and horror.

Cons:
Content (some) and length - Too much as for me, I was a bit tired at 80% of the playthrough.
Romance - It starts to develop closer to final missions, which is not super interesting.
Choices - Unfortunately in this game they have almost no meaning. I guess they should influence Andromeda sequels, if they will be released at all.
Side missions - Some of them are like ""collect x of x and return"". As for me, they should be removed completely.
Ending - It feels so rushed, few final missions could have been like 10 missions or just much longer. Instead, it feels like rewind on some x3-x5 speed.
Crafting - I just don't see a reason for it, as well as collecting resources. As well as those AI team missions at the table for resources.
Menus - Especially mission categories, they are very tedious to work with. Also, with mouse menus feel unresponsive and broken at times.
Steam Overlay support - Upon activating, game had problems with stuck mouse cursor that I had to cure with relaunching the game completely.
Field of view - Has one setting, but two types: without weapon and with it (shallow). I could not find adequate setting, so both looked ok. Why in combat it multiplies by 1.5-2 - I have no idea, maybe console gaming roots..

I'd say it is like 6.5-7/10. Instead of throwing time into garbage bin with fetch quests, crafting and all other nonsence, they should have put time in main story missions. Because last few of them definitely show that EA had no time and just rushed, cutting parts of them.

Combat wise, this game is the best since unlike the trilogy, there is no class system and all the powers are available for you to invest in as you play. Simply speaking, you can use whatever you want and change it whenever you want. 

Despite expanding the story of the Mass Effect universe to a whole new galaxy, Andromeda lacks the attraction the series offered to us for many years.

I put in 72 hours into it (that's what Origin tells me), I beat the game, I did most of the side stuff, and then put it down for the past 3 years because I was waiting for the now cancelled Quarian Ark dlc.
To be brief this game can be summed up like this: ME:A is a pretty good game but it isn't a good Mass Effect game. I recommend it but definitely get it when it's on SALE.

Pros:
- Best combat and exploration in the franchise
- Nomad controls very well... unlike the Mako.
- Researching weapons and armour allows you to create your own crafted weapons that are better than the ones you can purchase.
- Like in ME2, there is an emphasis on building relationships with your crewmates and there are loyalty missions for squadmates. IMHO the loyalty missions are better than the main story in a lot of ways.
- The game looks pretty good.
- Getting 100% viability on each planet feels fulfilling because you're changing them from being certain death to habitable.
- You are not limited to one class. You can change your class on the go and you can also change your character's appearance anytime too.

Cons
- Optimization is pretty bad. 
- The story is average at best. The foundation of it is pretty much ME1's but sub out [spoiler] Saren and the reapers trying to turn everyone into synthetic monsters  [/spoiler] for [spoiler] Archon and the Kett's plan of turning everyone into bio monsters  [/spoiler] . 
- The cast can be very hit or miss depending on the person. 
- Quarian ark dlc was cancelled and turned into a comic. This sucks because it is teased in the game.",1602378670,1690461837,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm a bit of a completionist, so I played through every sidequest I could get my hands on, aside from a few of those non-marked objective tasks. Here's a breakdown about what I think about the game. For context, I've played up to starting Mass Effect 2 in the main series. I could not force myself to play the rest of ME2 before starting this game.

The Good:
I enjoyed the story and the choices. Having choices separated by tone rather than ""morality"" is Way better than the paragon/renegade system. The squadmate quests were all very enjoyable and delved into each of them more as characters. And speaking of squadmates, I ended up caring a lot about each and every one of them, and deeply enjoying their banter. 

In a lot of ways, I think Andromeda is like Mass Effect 1 but better. Given more time to bake in the oven, maybe, or maybe just more suited to what people want from rpgs these days. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed ME1, but this was just overall more fun, with much better characterization for its characters.

The Meh:
You can feel that they're leaving themselves open for a sequel to this instead of it just being a one-off, and that leaves some quests feeling unfulfilling and a gaggle of pretty important loose threads. On one hand, if it does get a sequel, it'll be much less jarring than the transition between Mass Effect 1 and 2. On the other, hardly anything is certain to get a sequel, so it's possible these things will never get a proper conclusion.

The Bad:
What in the world were they thinking with those terminal prompts? It's such a confusing system. It works, I guess, but it could've been implemented in a much cleaner, clear way. The menuing was also a bit of a pain to navigate, especially the quests menu. I get why some quests are sorted into where you received them instead of where they want you to go, but when I'm checking the quests on Elaaden, trying to see what I need to do before I go off-planet, I'm not going to be looking in the Aya folder.

There's also a little cutscene that plays each and every time you land on or leave a planet, and to my knowledge, it's unskippable, which is fine the first 5 or so times, but with how much I had to backtrack for sidequests, it was really grating on me. Add to that the unskippable scene that plays every time you jump systems, and I can only imagine how much time I wasted over all, just having to wait for them to finish. If there was a skip button, it was not either of the skip buttons presented in the game (space for skipping dialogue, tab for skipping approaching a planet.) The Tempest taking off every time you board it only added to the headache for me, especially when whatever quest I was on would require me to board it and then immediately go planet-side again.

While in Mass Effect 1, I enjoyed skimming over the little blurbs for random planets I found, I could not be bothered to read hardly any of the ones in this game. There are just too many, and I waste too much time even getting into a system to carefully read over the description of every planet that doesn't even have a landing. It's sad, I think, because I'm sure some of them are neat, but I only have so many hours a day, and I'd much rather be using that time advancing plotlines.

I could really do without the tasks that require randomly spawning items to advance them. I know it's probably supposed to encourage exploring, but it kind of impedes people who want to get the most out of every quest they receive. I'm not driving around Elaaden for an hour doing nothing, looking at nothing, when I've already sunk 85 hours into the game.

The Funny:
Love it when SAM says ""Pathfinder, you have new email."" It's not technically a wrong way to phrase it, since saying ""you have mail"" is grammatically correct, but I've never actually heard anyone say it like that. It cracks me up.

Overall:
If you enjoy Mass Effect 1, you'll probably like Andromeda. And if you've never played a Mass Effect game before... Well, you'll spoil yourself a bit for a few things that happen in the main series, but honestly? If you don't care about that, and what you see interests you, try it out! And at least this way, you might not feel obligated to finish the entire trilogy.

And I love Shepard, but playing as Ryder is just way more fun.

While the game wasn't fantastic and I had low expectations due to it being made for consoles too, it was very good when it released, the hovering was a cool and well done feature. The companions and the ""politically correct"" ugly or fat-ish asari did bother me slightly but overall you could play for hours and not notice or care about it.
The best part and the selling point as to why I recommend this interesting cool new storyline with better than previous ME titles, open world (kinda like Dragon Age Inquisition), is the multiplayer which they kinda banked on I assume to make lots of money. Now you can buy tons but it will take a lot of money to even get remotely good at the multiplayer, so I don't recommend it even tho I have to admit I was slightly rich and spent a few dollars on it myself. You can easily farm up the gear and unlock new characters FREE just by playing, once you get a decent level or gun on a character that you enjoy you can try gold difficulty or hope you get carried by better players. Making 50-60k credits or 125k on the platinum (not recommended at all until you have at least unique or level 20 with bonus levels to a character you know how to play) will earn you lootboxes with random gear VERY FAST. After that you can keep farming with a good team or just play new characters and level them up, honestly there is so much content in multiplayer it would cover all my several playthroughs of ME1,2,3 and I would still have more to do. 
Now of course the devs are scummy and invented new stupid weapons to add, which are ""ok"" for hardcore players but suck if you are new or trying to get the best weapons and rank them up. Since I keep getting stupid versions of the same fucking gun instead of getting the highest tier and new guns I would actually like. I mean it is a grinding process but with a good team and a bit of skill you could clear 500k 25 items (10 rare or ultra rare) in less than 2 hours. The multiplayer is an enhanced version of the ME3 multiplayer that they removed from the anniversary version with a lot of characters and weapons and boosters or gear. 
Considering the price here on steam I would recommend this even for the single player but you should check the multiplayer since it's only pve not pvp so there are no griefers or pay2win.
Also there is a cool app you can use to keep farming points and gear on your main single player campaign by sending teams to do missions for you, I love that. At this point I am so rich on my main character and got all the best items of my specific level just by playing multiplayer or sending teams to do my job.

Going deep well into the game, I found myself abhorring almost anything about it. We've got pretty much dull and lifeless characters (except a couple of companions on your squad), lame and uninviting dialogues, unexciting voice-acting, meaningless missions all over the planets (it just gets alright if you're to only go for the main missions), a darn much repetitiveness, handful of bugs every here and there, frequent FPS drops and having to waste so frigging much time on flying over to another planet just by making you watch travel animations between the planets without delivering a skip option, which feels EXTREMELY irritating, tedious and frustrating over time.

This game's nothing alike the ME trilogy, already knowing that it's not a sequel to any of these but boy, ME: Andromeda is just a grand world rifed with errand tasks. The nicest thing I can add up is that it has great visuals and futuristic looks, a get-by storyline and is a satisfying shooter. You may wanna consider buying it when on sale.

Anyway, I have only 100 hours in the game and have still barely scratched the surface of everything the game has to offer. I love the game and definitely would recommend it to any open world RPG lover. 9.5/10 Great game to play while waiting for Starfield.

Positives for me:

1) Graphics 
2) Story
3) Combat mechanics
4) Weapons and Armor variety and upgrades
5) Research and Development
6) Character and weapon customization and character, weapon weapon and ship color customization
7) Alien races and enemies
8) Planet, environment and character structure artwork 
9) RPG dialogue and choices and consequences
10) Player builds

Negative for me:

1) Having to wait to explore, while the radiation levels go down, by progressing the main story
2) Not being able to go explore and loot everything, because certain main story missions won't allow it
3) The romance options were bad. I need a white or Asian female brunette. Suvi is nice, but a lesbian.
4) The player crouches and gets stuck in certain areas, but at least I can fast travel to fix the problem, except in missions, which luckily has not happened yet.
5) Unavailable save option while playing missions. Luckily, I have not died yet in any mission.

It’s one really fun ride with a great mix of mystery, heart, humor and fast paced combat. Andromeda presents us the idea of what if we could just escape to another galaxy and start fresh, essentially a sci-fi spin into moving out to a new city. This is the core driving story of the game as every character has their own unique story reasons as to why they chose to leave the Milky way Galaxy, but the game perhaps relies too much on the past history of the Milky way and its races. Where the game truly shines is when it opens up to its brand new discoveries and designs, in this new planets that you must explore and uncover, you will find what the game calls “Remnant Vaults”, big computer networks installed into each planet to control weather conditions that make planets habitable, but you must enter them and fix them to work so that you can start building colonies in these planets. These vaults are the main highlight of the game, with very nicely crafted and visual presentations on them, it is always interesting to find out more about these machines and its creators, and the game does a good job in answering some of these questions while keeping a lot more others open for the future. The other exciting part of the game is getting to meet a new species, in this case the angara, unfortunately this only ever happens once in the game properly. Because the other new species you meet is right from the start your enemy.

Unfortunately, that’s where Andromeda’s storytelling struggles the most, everytime it brings something new and refreshing with a lot of potential it gets interrupted by having to deal with the milky way specific narratives, that sometimes make for great struggles but other times it feels like it takes away from key unique moments. Starting a new story in the world of mass effect after a trilogy of spending time with so many characters and decisions was always going to be a huge challenge for Andromeda, and while I think it manages to overcome it in some ways, it still could have taken more risks in bringing more new than old at its core, as it relies too much on the “milky way” nostalgia sometimes. That said, it still feels fresh and different enough for better and for worse, some will enjoy the new direction of exploration as the focus with a much younger less experienced cast of characters, while others might be disappointed that it is not a military trained veterans focused game like the trilogy. Still, I think there’s enough interesting story beats to at least play through once just for the story alone.

From a gameplay combat standpoint however, Andromeda definitely feels a great improvement from the trilogy. Exploration like Mass Effect 1 returns here and it feels a lot more polished with the new “Nomad” rover car vehicle you get to explore maps. The physics on this vehicle feel really great, and so do the upgrades you can explore with it. Doing quests around the planet exploration always vary between interesting or a drag, but  the game does a good job classifying them in the objectives menu in what may seem more important than others (Tasks usually being the fillers). There is still room for improvement on the quest exploration side (specially when some quests make you planet hop a lot, which means loads screen) but I personally enjoyed doing everything I could find. The combat also in this game is a lot more freeing to truly create your own playstyle and explore, as  you can switch to being a biotic,soldier, tech or even a hybrid of all 3 on the fly. Mobility also feels great with the addition of a boost jump jetpack that gives you a lot of freedom to maneuver combat scenarios. Weapons feel good enough and varied as well, even though sometimes it might get confusing how to obtain them with so many options to get them.

Overall, I still have a lot of love for  this game, it is just a shame it didn’t launch in a good state back then, perhaps history would have played out differently if the game we have now here had been the launch version. The issues with the game now are just more of personal preference style rather than actual major issues per say, but still, I recommend giving this one a try. Also contrary to the Trilogy LE, this one’s trophies do work with EA App on steam at least!

I bought it when it was first released, and BOY were there bugs. Most, if not all, of that has been fixed by now, and the gameplay is nice and consistent. There are many planets to explore, many optional quests, some good companions (some boring), and a lot of visually neat things to look at! 
Over-all, if you like open world RPGs, or any previous bioware games, I'd say you'll like this one. It doesn't have the heart-wrenching storyline, or intense characters we've all grown to love over the previous series', but it is good in it's own way.

  What little fun there is to be had in missions and activities is sprinkled across the turd sandwich. With repetitive gameplay, boring and bland NPC's, graphics that would have fit right in on the Xbox 360, and an ending that was so lackluster I didn't initially believe that I had beaten the game and the fact that your choices dont even amount to much. I regret paying the money to play this. I regret the amount of time it took me to finish it because although I hated the experience and the gratuitous amount of travel to planet X to have conversation then travel to play Y to collect item then travel to planet Z to turn in quest. Litteral hours were spent sitting in loading screens traveling from A to B.

  Even after defeating the Big Bad at the end, doing countless quests and trying to make the best possible decision there is no pay off, no aftermath, no acknowledgement for your hard work and dedication to completing the game. It leaves off on a cliff hanger, open ended, with unanswered questions, and a feeling of being cheated.

For this elderly arctic lupine known as Kiba Snowpaw, this disappointment was not just a gaming letdown, but a monumental catastrophe, with the fiery wreckage of my expectations strewn across the icy tundra of my once hopeful heart.

Armed with decades of gaming experience, fueled by anime, movies, manga, and indie projects from Kickstarter, Patreon, and Bandcamp, I prided myself on being a supporter of the gaming world. But the one universe that could have satisfied my gaming appetite, my geeky interests, and my dedication to the fantastic realm of digital entertainment fell flat on its face.

Enter Mass Effect Andromeda Deluxe Edition.

My wolfish paws trembled with anticipation as I loaded up the game. I braced myself for the excitement, the thrill of discovery, and the brilliant story-telling that the original trilogy had set the bar for. But, alas! What I found was a shell of a game, a parody of its predecessor, wrapped in a blanket of mediocrity.

Oh, the humanity (or should I say, the alienity)! The game that was supposed to be the magnum opus of the Mass Effect series, a science-fiction odyssey set in an unknown galaxy, was, in fact, a veritable black hole of disappointment. It wasn't so much a game as it was a never-ending cosmic joke, filled with shallow characters, underwhelming narratives, and a UI that seemed more suitable for a toddler's tablet game.

The company behind this affront to my senses was none other than BioWare Montreal, a team known for their exemplary work on Mass Effect 3's multiplayer. Yet, somehow, the transition from multiplayer to a full-fledged RPG proved too daunting. Instead of building on the foundations laid by the original trilogy, they provided a gameplay experience that felt more like trudging through the slush of an alien tundra than exploring a new frontier.

For a moment, let's look at the few redeeming features. The combat, I concede, was more dynamic than in previous iterations, with a fluidity and range of choices that made battles more engaging. The weaponry felt solid and the introduction of jump-jets added a welcome dose of adrenaline to the mix. Even the vehicles, a glaring issue in the original trilogy, were significantly improved, culminating in the sleek Nomad, which handled like a dream.

But a game cannot stand on combat alone, and this is where Andromeda went to the gallows.

The characters were mere shadows of their predecessors. They lacked depth, complexity, and growth. The Krogan was little more than a savage brute, the Asari was a one-note scholar, and don't even get me started on the human characters. SAM, the AI, was like a fly buzzing in your ear that just wouldn't stop. The narrative failed to elicit any emotional responses, and the quests felt like chores rather than immersive experiences. The dialogue was awkward and forced, stripping the game of any semblance of seriousness or urgency.

The game was a bitter pill to swallow, especially for a frosty canine like myself. The animation was far from the fluid, cinematic spectacle it should have been, giving characters a stilted, lifeless quality. Resource scavenging was tedious and unfulfilling, and the vast open world was empty and void of excitement. And the 'scan' mechanic was an unending, relentless torment, akin to howling into the void and hearing nothing but your own echoes.

The final nail in the coffin was the ridiculous facial animations. They were so absurd that I found myself laughing out loud, which is more emotion than I experienced during any part of the story. The only saving grace was the occasional successful joke and some enjoyable combat sequences. But, like a blizzard in summer, they were fleeting and far between.

In conclusion, dear reader, I cannot recommend Mass Effect Andromeda. If you value your time, your money, and your sanity, avoid it like a rabid, frothing varren. Save yourself from the icy clutches of disappointment and don't be lulled into the false promises of adventure and excitement. As I have learned through the long, lonely nights on my frosty world, not all that glitters in the cosmos is gold. Sometimes, it's just the cold, cruel sparkle of mediocrity.

Full review:

I previously purchased this game on Origin which has since been replaced by the EA app. I really loath their launcher so much. It checks your location and sends all sorts of metrics back to them when a game launches and adds needless bloat. I purchased the Steam version so that I can easily launch it through my Steam Deck. My review is based on it as a game for the Steam Deck.

The launcher is a super pain in the butt to get setup without using a mouse in the steam deck because of the drop downs for specifying your birthday. I setup my EA steam purchases through a separate EA account from my primary EA account because the steam version of the games do not work if you have the EA app; version loaded on the computer. Even if you have both downloaded. Once you get past the god awful account creation/sign in process the game loads right up. So for the steam version you almost don't see the launcher. However it is there and snooping as much as ever so it seems to need a internet connection to launch an offline single player game. That burns me up. Their game has been pirated to heck and back so punishing people years later with this garbage is a slap in the face.

Once the game is launched it will complain about the network going out but the game will still work so allowing the steam deck to sleep and then resume works.

Game wise this is a good game. It's a shame it never got DLC to finish the story and flesh out more of the universe. Sadly it's EA killing everything we love. They buy up great companies, milk them and then gut them. Bioware is being milked and so close to getting gutted it is quite sad. Thankfully EA seems to see single player games as viable again so hopefully Bioware will be free to make more games but who knows.

It not only introduced me to the captivating Mass Effect franchise but also led me to explore the legendary edition, which further deepened my appreciation for this immersive universe. While the game did have its fair share of bugs and glitches, I found that with a little modification, it became significantly more enjoyable and personalized.

One minor criticism I have is that the game lacks native 4K support. As someone who recently acquired a 4K monitor, I longed for the game's visuals to match the capabilities of my new hardware. However, this drawback didn't overshadow the many positive aspects of Mass Effect Andromeda.

One of the game's greatest strengths lies in its diversity, expertly incorporated by Bioware. The inclusion of diverse characters and engaging romances added depth and richness to the narrative. Though I would have loved to see more cutscenes in the Reyes romance storyline, the game still managed to breathe life into the characters, thanks to its well-executed art style, which some might dismiss as ""cartoonish."" However, for me, this choice made my character feel more alive, making me emotionally invested in their journey.

Furthermore, the character customization options were outstanding, allowing me to create a unique protagonist that truly represented my vision. This feature, combined with the engaging gameplay, led me to spend countless hours creating YouTube content. The joy and satisfaction I derived from this process were unmatched, and I eagerly anticipate more games that offer such deep character customization and immersive cutscenes to further enhance my content creation endeavors.

If you are a fan of the Mass Effect franchise or someone who desires to witness their sci-fi character come to life, I wholeheartedly recommend Mass Effect Andromeda. To maximize your enjoyment, I advise using a mod manager to address any lingering bugs and issues, particularly with the seating mechanics.

In conclusion, Mass Effect Andromeda is a masterpiece that offers an unforgettable journey through space. Its flaws are overshadowed by its strengths, and its ability to bring characters and romances to life is unparalleled. Get ready to embark on an adventure that will leave you yearning for more games with exceptional character customisation and immersive cutscenes.",1689475749,1689475749,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

The combat scenarios feel like mass effect where they set up good scenarios for the context of the shooting. Tech Combos feel like genshin. But theres a lot of talking. Theres so many characters and sometimes i wish i could just get to the shooting. But reading data pads containing notes adds to the understanding of whats going on. Sometimes quests don't properly show up on the map. I think this is one of those things where they didn't have time to finish it but it adds legitimacy when you are paying attention.  Your curiosity of wait didnt I have to do something with a quest over here but theres no marker. And it turns out there was. Its satisfying

Thankfully b4 u land all quests available are shown as you hover over the planet. But when u land sometimes u have to go digging in your quest log.

The galaxy exploration of going to different planets is tedious even with the shorter cinematic mod. I think mass effect andromeda with mods is a good game but requires way more work from the player to have a good time.

And even then there are times where I wish I could just be doing something else within the game.
Also the main character is sort of a jack ass. I remember Commander Shepard being more appropriate and just better as a character


I dont think character development is as bad as people say. This game is older than the other mass effects and contains more content in general. Older games being more linear in nature.
It feels like space dragon age inquisition with too many characters and political space bureaucracy
With less epic high stakes choices

It is the first of the Mass Effect Andromeda games. And really should only be compared to the first Mass Effect, as far as writing goes. 

If you had a hard time with the trilogy, namely relating to Commander Shepard, you may find Mass Effect Andromeda more enjoyable. Commander Shepard is great, in my book. One of my all time favorite characters. But Shepard can be hard to relate to for some people given how professional and military he/she is (which is truer in the first Mass Effect than 2 and 3, for better or worse). 

Ryder is about 20. Ryder's personality is up to each player. You can be logical/emotional, casual/professional. Players can play a Ryder whom they relate to and are like, or not if they so please. There is quite a bit of freedom in this compared to the Mass Effect Trilogy. 

The class/career system is different than before. Some will love the flexibility others will hate it. I am not thrilled with how they handled the engineer class. I do not find the drone in MEA helpful. :/ The engineer class was better in Mass Effect 3. It is my favorite class. But in Mass Effect Andromeda I tend to play as a biotic. 

In general I am hoping for them to allow us to use any of our skills whenever we want. Like in the first Mass Effect. But that is unlikely. At least give us more key bindings. Though given how MEA handles it, we can have a few different sets of key bindings which we can switch between in the field and amid combat. So that is an improvement from Mass Effect 2-3. 

Beautiful graphics. Though the character creation available is not the best. So many facial features are largely dependent on which face shape (or complexion) you choose. Such as eyebrow shape and nose. Then the skin tone you chose effects the eyebrow color. Brunettes have the widest range of options, if you want matching eyebrows. Blondes have the worst.

 So, here is hoping that they give us a character creation model closer to what Dragon Age Inquisition had, even though that isn't exactly how the Mass Effect character creation menus have been. 

I love that you have the option for your Ryder's appearance to change what Alec Ryder looks like. It is also great that you can customize your twin. I love to give my Ryder's twin to look more like their mother, since the playable Ryder takes after their father. I love it when a game allows character customization AND also includes your character having a family they were born or raised with. Which is a little weird since I always played Shepard as an orphan (probably because as far as I know you never see Shepard's born/raised family). 

The characters are alright. Personally, there isn't anyone I feel Ryder just HAS to romance yet. We just don't know the cast that well yet. Peebee is my favorite character by a mile though. 

There is a great deal to explore. You can fight as much as you want since the game is designed to be more open world than the Mass Effect Trilogy was. I would love to have time actually pass when we visit planets. To see the sunrises and sunsets. Maybe in the next one with a Mass Effect title. 

I really like how gear is handled in this one. Though I am bummed about the paint jobs you can give your armor. Namely that no matter which color you chose for N7 armor it looks 100% like carbon fiber. In Mass Effect 3 certain colors you chose can result in a metallic appearance of certain parts of the armor. But it is swell to the degree you can customize armor and even casual clothing. 

Space travel has improved. No more flat maps to fly around on. Now we just select a destination and enjoy beautiful rendered outer space scenes. 

Anyways, that is all I have to say for now on this subject. I hope you all have fun and give this game the fair shake it deserves. See you in Andromeda, Patherfinder. :)",1688940606,1689012388,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Longer version. The game is genuinely, not a ""bad"" game. Problem is it's an extremely mediocre game taking advantage of a franchise name with an existing fanbase. Even all this time after it's release it's extremely buggy. Narrative wise the best description I've got it it is one given to me by someone else ""They got the wrong idea from the Citadel DLC"". They very much wanted Ryder, and the story in general to be ""funny"", but it sucks the drama from most of the game. It's like going to see an action movie, and finding out you got a comedy. I'm not against comedy by any means, but it's very heavy handy and adds nothing. Further more more dialogue decisions don't really matter, because regardless if you're trying to be serious, or more ""paragon"" or ""renegade"", you end up sounding like a wise-cracking TV series protagonist. The story itself, without spoilers, is honestly like a worse rehash of the the original Mass Effect's story. Additionally they very much try to get the narrative drama and payoff of three games in one, and very much do not manage it. 

The game is also everything I've come to hate about ""Open World"" games. They confuse ""content"" and ""story"" for throwing as much busy-work at you as possible. You get a bunch of minor story lines that don't really go anywhere, flesh out the world, or add to the narrative. Absolutely some do, but they're few and far between. The combat is also awful. It's very much back to ""the enemies just ran at you/around cover, so it's functionally useless"" except at least when it happened in Mass Effect 1 those enemies usually came from one direction, now they come from every direction, and the cover frequently doesn't work even if you do manage to get it between you and them. In addition every fight, even the boss fights, felt functionally the same. Even the final boss fight wasn't any different, just longer.

It's a shame EA rushed this out the door, there are still stuff to fix and add but nothing game breaking unless you use mods like me , at which point game might brake :)) but nothing to ruin the experience.
The combat is fun even if it has been simplified and now you can have only 3 powers to combine as you like while classes  have become profiles with passsive bonuses.Its a nice change with room for improvements , but as it is it makes combat fun not being limited to a certain class, something the originals didn't have.
The story is there but nothing like the originals, mainly because the main villain isn't as much of a known threath as he should be, after some sidequests you just forget he exists untill the game reminds you.
The pacing is off , especially if you go on doing sidequests , there are very few emotional moments and for the most part don't feel so just because of a lack of proper facial animation.
I personally had no problem running it even with the shit EA launcher, didn't encounter any problems there.
I'll leave it a Like just because I had a lot of fun and enjoyd some of the chatacters and their interactions.lf only EA didn't pull the plug, this game had so much more to tell and develop.

However I feel these bugs, while annoying to deal with do not occur often enough to justify bashing and trashing the game.

The game has a lot going for it, firstly it's packed with content, missions and side missions. There are various character side ark missions and it basically ensures you'll be playing the game for quiet some time assuming you partake in the side missions and so on. There are multiple ways you can tweak and spec your character to adjust to a style you'd prefer to play as, wanna be a tank? Go ahead, wanna be a sneaky stealth assassin? go for it, wanna be a super agile assault unit able to teleport over short distances? What's stopping you?

The game itself feels a little bit too grindy to level up to get to top level and unlock the best gear but then you don't really need the best gear to finish the main story line and side quests so I'm a bit on the fence about that. The game itself has pretty much no replay value beyond just wanting to see what the different outcomes are for various choices since the main plot stays the same or if you're speed running the game but to be honest you'll get a good 40 hours worth of game play at minimum (Assuming you're not just speed running through the game on easy difficulty), I myself got about 80-90 hours of play time playing on the hardest difficulty and doing most of the side quests as well as some random exploring so it's well worth the price, particularly if it's on a discount.

It feels a lot more like a startrek game with a big bad guy verse the military campaign of the trilogy. For me the power customization and crafting of your gear lets you play the class/style you want, verse the game dictating what you do with the ""best available loot""

The exploration with the ground vehicle, Nomad is a lot of fun, just don't forget to upgrade it. The thing is a total blast to drive around in and listening to your teammates talk. It is sort of like the Elevator rides in ME1, but instead of watching a load screen you get to blast around on a planet.  The vehicle's physics are really cool especially in low gravity environments. 

For me the best way to enjoy the game is play around a little with side quests but try to work towards the main quest. There is a lot to do and it can become a slog doing every little thing. The Plus side of playing this way is it makes second and third plays a lot more fun as you still have lots of discovery because of the way the game is set up. Skipping entire planets or large portions of some will make that next play feel very fresh.

I played it 3 times before i really saw everything and using different combo's of the team really made each play fairly unique. Personally i enjoyed Female Ryder's VA more as the reluctant yet hopeful explorer trying to make a new galaxy a better place.

As far as the environments go they really are great. The Alien tech and vaults you will explore really have an out of this world feeling. Instead of hearing stories about an ancient race and tech you sort of live it as you go. ME:A is really an underrated game with great combat, some crafting and a great ground vehicle to go along with a ship that feels alive. 

The main bad guy's have some nice flavor as you learn more about them and how the interact with the alien tech and the other main Native race to the galaxy. A quick play is maybe around 40-60 hours, doing everything can easily take over 100.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not what I expected. I came into the game expecting something similar to the previous Mass Effect games, and although it does feel like it while you're playing it, you quickly realize it's not. That's not to say it's a bad game; it's just that if you're expecting an experience similar to the ME trilogy, you won't find that here. The story starts strong but becomes a bit dull over time. Yet, this game addressed a lot of issues I had with the previous Mass Effects. The combat is amazing, and the menu system is neatly laid out and organized. The game still consists of bugs, not a lot, but enough to become noticeable and require some game restarts. 

My biggest annoyance with this game is the sheer volume of side quests. Usually, I would never complain about content, but the side quests often present the player with what I felt was an illusion of choice. It tries to make you feel as if your decision matters when it doesn't. Not to say that the side quests are bad, they are a lot that are quite enjoyable; it's just that the choices you make, although they may be presented as such, they never have a profound impact, so don't approach them as such. Additionally, the amount of fetch quests is sometimes overwhelming. When there's so much to do, it's often difficult to decide where to start :( 

For the most part, if you're a fan of sci-fi and action games and this game is on sale, I'd say get it. The gameplay is quite entertaining, and if you don't pay too much attention to side quests, it's definitely a neat experience.",1688507622,1688507622,True,9,0,0.605206131935119629,0,True,False,False

What a dead and empty universe, after everything they had built in the trilogy. The only redeeming factors are the ending is actually quite good, the worlds are beautiful and the gameplay is an improvement.

Everything else is quite pathetic. The worst obviously being the characters. They are horrible. The 2 human squad mates being so unlikable that you never use them and try avoid any conversion with them at all costs. 

The second sin are the animations and character models for the NPC, or lack of any. You have seen the memes. What is often ignored is that they only have a single character model for each of the alien races. They all are identical, where they had more in previous games. Never seen such lazy work, it is honestly disgusting this was let our the door like this, and the team involved I hope are still out of jobs.

Then lets get back to the world. Planets are beautiful, but that is it. There are no new races apart from one. One race (split in 2) in a whole new galaxy. We are even missing the Quarians from the old races which was cut for DLC that never released. And the one race we get are so boring. Visually and in terms of depth. There is no deep lore for them, nothing like the races we have come to know.

All the interesting bits, the mystery and hints were never completed. An unfinished game that really had promise if only the people involved actually were good at delevering what they were given. They butchered a beloved franchise and luckily most of them are no longer working and hopefully stay out of gaming for ever. Don't blame crunch or short development time.

The problem with this game is it's hard to get into it right after you play the original trilogy (which i've played at least 5x).

It's a buggy mess but not game-breaking.

Pros:
 - great, fast-paced gameplay
 - unlike the Mako, the Nomad is actually enjoyable to drive
 - almost all crew members are likable (except Liam. even in character convos, the others don't like him much)
 - very diverse worlds

Cons:
 - graphical glitches and mission bugs
 - some additional tasks are RNG so it's hard to trigger or complete
 - human facial animation and over all design
 - all asari and kett look the same
 - weird running momentum
 - picking up loot is all but useless since the best items are researched and developed

- Beautiful game
- Classic Mass Effect chioce based gameplay without the hassle of ultra ally character customisation
- Agreeable enough storyline
- No strings romance options

Cons:
- Sickeningly woke characters.  Unrelenting and constant DEI dialogue until the games choices force you to agree with woke outcomes or you're punished.  Constant in-game emails about mental health and ""it's ok not to be ok"" and processing trauma etc.  Like, b!tch please, I shoot hostile aliens in the face because I have humanity's survival on my shoulders.  If I'm not ""ok"" I shouldn't be doing the fvcking job.
- Utterly pointless interactions/conversations that were game objectives.  Could have cut hours upon hours of useless gameplay out of this.  (e.g:  OBJECTIVE:  Go talk to Cora about her gardening aspirations - that is it, no side missions, no XP bonus, no special items unlocked, no loyalty bonuses or powers - just talk to a woman about gardening)
- Platform is broken.  In the end, it was taking me 20+ minutes to open the game.  Here's what it looked like:-
Turn off VPN
Uninstall all DLC
Reinstall all DLC
Verify Integrity of Game Files
Create system admin authorisation for Steam
Allow EA app to crash and restart four times until game forced its way through.

Advice: when on a planet collect all the missions you can and don't leave till you've done all you can, complete whats in the area you're already going to...

Pros : Multiple combat options genuinely fun to play, the main story is interesting (just not as gripping as MS2), a lot of the people feel real and there are a few story missions that got me think this is bad ass, as well as some enviros I thought this is beautiful, the game will occupy you for a long time if you let it.

Cons : SPACE TRAVEL LOTS AND LOTS OF SPACE TRAVEL (like slow cutscenes, cool at first but overtime it wares on you), lots of cliffhangers and loose ends, animations can be bad (especially facials at times) but I personally don't think its a big issue.. seen worse lol, there are sections of the game that may bore you but if you push through you'll still probably have a good time.

All in all, even though the game does have flaws, it was still a fun play through, with an interesting  overall plot... All that being said, now to get into the nitty-gritty details (Warning - Possible SPOILERS ahead):

Graphically the game is better then the Mass Effect 1 through 3 games when it comes to over all quality, which is probably due to the newer engine... But, that being said, there was some obvious flaws as well... Such as the facial animations needing a bit more polish... Unlike the prior Mass Effect games, where a majority of the time I felt the emotion, not only because of the well done voice acting, but because of the facial queues and so forth... In Andromeda, most of the time the facial expressions did not match the emotions betrayed by the voice acting, at least not as much as they should have... The UI itself was fine for the most part, although I could have done without having to press ESC a million times to get out of sub-menus/screens... But that was a Quality of Life issue, not graphics...

The transition scenes when landing or taking off definitely could have either been drastically shorter, or a Skip mechanic would have been nice (like with traveling from planet to planet in the same system)... I even tried a Mod to shorten them, to no avail... They were still entirely too long... Sure, the immersion aspect was cool, but after seeing the same scenes over and over again and being forced to wait for them to complete was annoying... Game breaking annoying? Not really, but still a Quality of Life issue...

Also, I'm guessing the developers either didn't have the budget or perhaps it was laziness, but almost every single Asari had the exact same facial model with only an occasional minor alteration... Lexi, a crew member, should of at least been completely different looking then the others... They had a different one for Peebee, why not Lexi? Almost every single mission/dialogue that involved Asari, most looked almost identical to Lexi (barring very minor alterations)... Threw off the immersion... I could understand it with the Kett, because they  were all genetically engineered to be almost identical (based on class), but why most of the Asari? I didn't run into that with ME1 through 3, so why do it in MEA other then budget or laziness... Most humans looked different, and even the other races had enough difference to tell them apart, mostly...

As far as game play, obviously it is a big alteration to how ME1 through 3 did things, for the most part... Having only 3 active abilities to use, even though technically with the game having no level cap, you could earn most active abilities in the game... I could live with that, as you could still have most passives eventually, as well as some other perks from spending points on powers unrelated to your chosen active powers/weapons... 

As far as continuing the game, after completing the overall Main Story, because I completed most planets and their various story lines and side quests prior to finishing the main story... I ended up running out of meaningful missions to complete, that included any real story... Only thing you end up having left, after a while, is defeating the endless waves of baddies at various spawn points on various planets... You do have quite a few NPC's you can talk to, all throughout the game, which adds immensely to the RPG aspects of the game... Which I highly appreciated... But that well runs dry eventually as well... In the end, after the main story was done, I really didn't feel enough of a driving force/motivation to keep me playing, beyond cleaning up a few unfinished side missions and crew involved story lines/conversations...

Plus, Post-Main Story, I felt like the game should have just started wrapping things up, followed by an actual end... The motivation post-Main Story just isn't there enough, at least for me, because I had done most content prior to finishing the Main Story and was only left with some wrap up quests to complete... So in the end, the ending felt a bit lack luster and empty... Like it should have just ended after a few of the post-Main Story missions involving your crew and the protagonists family story, and been done... Leaving it open ended was different but also a bit boring... The lack of a driving force, like the main story, to keep you motivated to finish most of the side content, was over with a bit too early in my opinion... Twas still a fun ride none-the-less (that end-fight was a pain in the rear but still fun)... 

There are other things I could talk about, but I think I've been long winded enough already... To wrap up, yes, the game is not perfect, with some mechanics that are a bit annoying to deal with sometimes, but all-in-all I did enjoy the over all plot and RPG aspects of the game... It's not quite as good as it's predecessors, but it's also not a flop in my book... So would I pay full release price for it? Probably not... But getting it on sale or as part of a bundle, sure... That's how I got it... And would I play it again? Maybe, but it would have to be a while... As I don't see a sequel to this game being a thing, based on how badly it was received by the general gaming public... But you never know...",1687487889,1687487889,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

[list]
[*] [b] improved combat[/b]: you can now mix and match your skills and your class specialization on the fly for some hilarious combos!
[*] [b] vastly improved exploration[/b]: all worlds are unique, with a lot of quests and discoveries to be made.
[/list]

[h1] Weak points[/h1] 
[list]
[*] [b] Storytelling[/b]: it's subpar. It has it's moments, but it doesn't play in the same league as the original Mass Effect. Characters, dialogue and exposition can be bland, inadequate, uninspiring and sometimes straight up incompetent or not to be taken seriously. Many times it felt like the childish nonsense of some rambling teenager.

Don't get me wrong. It get established from the start that the entire Expedition leadership INCLUDING the protagonist are not qualified for their job, and it's shown. They got bumped into the position because everyone else above them died. And while a team of ramshackly assembled misfits can be the start of a nice coming-of-age tale, growth needs to be SHOWN, it needs to be BELIEVABLE, and it needs to happen FAST. And had the writers introduced a mentor figure, maybe the story wouldn't be such a drag.

Several key story moments feel botched, like the first contact with a potentially friendly alien race in an otherwise hostile galaxy. What could have felt like a defining moment breaks down quickly into yet another fetch quest. Speaking of new species, the new one is bland (again). You see, in the original, every species had their defining trait. Human, Asari, Turian, Salarian... - tinker, tailor, soldier, spy. Each one contributed with their very own set of skills. But these new ones? The Angarans? I frankly don't know what they are good for. They sure talk about family and emotions a lot, a pity they have nothing to show for it...

And of course: bugs. The weird facial animations don't help immersion, and more than once i had the camera pan into a wall during an interaction, the responses from your teammates barely audible because they got themselves stuck in a wall some 10m behind you.

After playing it myself and making up my own mind I feel this game is criminally underrated. skip to the bottom if you just want the pros and cons list but here are my thoughts: 

The acting is ham, the characters are cheesy (especially in the first 45 mins of the game) and the main character is a Mary sue. The story is masterful, much better than mass effect 3 in my opinion. EA somehow managed to create an entire cast of new characters, bring a few older ones back and create an entirely new story line that actually surprised me although if you are a proactive scanner you will likely be rewarded for your investigation skills. I felt the weight of my decisions and there were meaningful and profound consequences. The chemistry between punishing the player and realistic outcomes is balanced nicely. 

  The graphics are INCREDIBLE! picture this- watching wind sweep dust that creates god rays reflecting off my armor in the alien sunlight while orbiting a planet wither several other moons as my skyline in the setting sun. The gunplay, level mechanics and world building are terrific. the story is actually very good. I am especially fond of the Krogen on my team and i find that i actually care about my crew. they all interact with one another as you would expect from a mass effect game. there are side quests for days, all are optional but if your a completest this will pull you away from other responsibilities. The planets change throughout the story line and the exploration is actually meaningful. the areas are large and the biomes are all completely different and have commendable attention to detail. 

Honestly whoever came up with this story really deserves a pat on the back. the whole team made a really good game despite the backlash from previous failures. overall the game is well worth 40 dollars, especially if you can get it on sale. The main campeign is replable and character import is enabled. you can build any class you want and the multiplayer reminds me of gears of war horde mode. there are still players, at least as of June 2023. 

PROS-
-Story Rich and canonical
-Very Pretty visuals
- Large explorable Biomes with distinct enviornments
- Fun Multiplayer that is new player friendly
- Character's that you care about
-Weapon/Armor crafting and level progression is done very well
-fan service
-Jetpack
-relationships- you know what i mean.
-friendly to budge builds-(RTX 1660 and I5 worked fine for me)

Cons-
-CHEESEY unrealistic origin story- your basically the hero of humanity with zero qualifications for being so.
-accidental sex scenes
- no spaceship flight?
-can be grindy...this could be good or bad depending on the player
-no swimming or water mechanics
-unable to check mission list for a system from the galaxy map forcing you to sit through a travel cutscene
-limited dialog options at times
-some glitches are present, the nature of the jetpack and thrust mechanics make getting stuck a real possibility, also some enemies stick in the walls. requiring a reload of the previous save to fix. I have encountered this twice in a 70 hour playthrough. more of an inconvenience.

Overall if you are a mass effect fan you will enjoy this game. if you are looking for a sci fi story rich RPG focused on exploration and trying different builds this game is for you. if you like competative pvp experiences this game is  NOT for you. if you want to relax and be kept busy for a few hours you, like me are going to love this game. 8/10",1687449796,1687449796,True,1,0,0.509716033935546875,1,True,False,False

I'm glad I did, I really enjoyed the game when I realized that I should not have expectations related to how the original trilogy was but how good was it as a stand-alone game and let me tell you, while it might not be as greatest Mass Effect game, it's definitely worthy of being the first of a new journey and tell us a new story. It could be better at certain things but it is still a good game. Story wise, it is solid and makes a pretty good job connecting the present story with the original trilogy. Game mechanics are easy and enjoyable to play, at least in my opinion. Characters are likable although they could've been written and developed a little better. The final mission is not as epic as Mass Effect 3 final mission if you want a comparison, but it's good enough if we compare it with Mass Effect 1 last mission, The boss is underwhelming but it might make sense if we take into consideration that there are stronger enemies aside of the Archon, and this is exactly why I think that this might just be the first of a new trilogy.

- average main story
- new companions are dull shadows of previous ones, gear not changeable, AI combat behavior is more close-quarters oriented
- facial animations still have issues
- tons of fetch quests, constant backtracking between NPC
- planetary exploration feels unrewarding
- research points, where you need carefully choose what to research, as even after completing 96% of all content you can have only a few weapons and armors researched up to your level

It still has its bugs (though, not as many as it had at launch), and it got so much negative press from the critics (and the internet), it may turn some players off immediately. But, they've largely been fixed and honestly, the devs and writers came up with a whole new galaxy in the ME world, with a deep story that revolves around something besides reapers, and has all the hall marks of a great ME game.

The Emperor's mercy cannot reach this game, for it is plagued with a myriad of issues that tarnish the once illustrious Mass Effect franchise. From the very beginning, the character animations are as lifeless as a necron tomb world. It feels like I am watching a troupe of confused guardsmen trying to perform Shakespeare with their bolt pistols instead of acting.

The game's writing, once a shining beacon of storytelling excellence, has been reduced to a sad parade of stale clichés and predictable plot twists. Even a lowly servitor could compose a more engaging narrative. Dialogue options are as shallow as a mud puddle on an agri-world, with little impact on the outcome of events.

Exploration, a hallmark of the series, is reduced to a tedious chore. Lifeless and repetitive environments stretch out before you like a barren wasteland, devoid of any excitement or wonder. The repetitive tasks assigned by the Nexus leadership are as dull as watching a grox graze on an Imperial farm.

The combat, while serviceable, lacks the tactical depth and satisfaction of its predecessors. The Emperor's wrath cannot be felt in the powers and weapons at your disposal. Battles devolve into mindless shooting galleries, devoid of any strategic thinking or tactical decision-making.

I can tell you now, the game is worth that money and maybe a bit more.

However it is lacking on many fronts.

Facial animations are poor. Makes it hard to immerse yourself in the game. Voice acting is fine though, although the choices you make feel forced and lacking in actual meaningful choice.

The combat, while diverse with many different ways to play gets very repetitive and the AI is easy to beat. It doesn't feel like it matters what you spec into and the squad mates you pick don't really matter either.

The game world itself is big, but lacking in the smaller details and everything feels static, it's hard to see progression of any kind until you get a big story arc jump and it just feels off. Random dialogue chatter stays the same through the entire game and the world feels.... Empty? I guess.

Of course it's been said before, but there's very little that ties this game into the Mass Effect series, however, they could use this game build on that and tie it in, in many interesting ways, it remains to be see if they have the ability to see the potential to do that.

There's probably more I could think of, but I want to list some positives.

The villain and their motivations make for a great story and I think they did alright fleshing that story out across the game. I completed almost all of the side quests, the actual story doesn't take 60 hours. However the side quests and loyalty quests don't feel like they have any bearing (as far as I can tell) over the end of the game.

The Tempest ship you use to navigate the galaxy hearkens back the Normandy from Mass Effect 3 and I enjoyed it, it wasn't too big, not too small, felt like home for you and your characters.

Speaking of vehicles, a lot of people didn't like the Nomad as primary means of travel and game play, I however enjoyed it, if the world was fleshed out with more POI's, a few more mechanics (other than mining) and more vehicle upgrades and customisation, I think people would've loved it a bit more (and so would I, I enjoyed it, but didn't love it).

Overall I'd say, yes, buy this game, only when it's on special though. You can see that this is another game that could've been amazing, that was rushed out the door because of investors, it feels unfinished and unpolished. Such a shame.

Mass Effect Andromeda is a dull game with a dull story. The combat feels like Fallout 4 with powers, without VATS, in the third person (complete with aimless looting). It doesn't ruin ME's lore so much as it just waters it down. The characters are boring and usually one-note (even the squadmates) and Ryder hardly commands respect. It feels like a bootleg Guardians of the Galaxy a lot of the time.

The lore Andromeda introduces is minimal. Since it's a new galaxy with only two new species, there's not much history to talk about.

The story is not only boring, but unsatisfying. Your superiors on the Nexus never warm up to you no matter how much work you put in to hand them a nice habitable galaxy. They are worse than ME1's council and sometimes it feels like the writers were doing it on purpose, as if they thought players enjoyed being belittled and talked down to constantly. Unlike ME1, however, you never get the chance to snap back at them or put them in their place.
Your squadmates outright do not respect you and never learn to. No one that knows you does, actually. There are multiple times where you will decide on a course of action and your squaddies are explicitly shown not to care what you think or have to say. You are the kid that lucked out on getting the Pathfinder position and that does not change until the end of the game, in which saving the entire Initiative and Angaran species is enough to get them all to start thinking of you as someone worthy of some small appreciation.

If I have to hear about Cora being an asariboo or Vetra's dumb sister again I will fucking scream. The only member of the Tempest crew I liked was Jaal, maybe Drack and Kallo too. They are also all exceedingly hostile to each other whenever they interact. Liam's conversation with Vetra is a great example, if you care to look it up.

The vast majority of the side quests are fetch quests. Some will be multi-part fetch quests in which you must travel to multiple different planets and enjoy the loading screen cutscenes between worlds/systems so you can fuck-all as a reward.

So so so much of the game is dedicated to exploration, which more-often-than-not feels like a slightly improved version of ME1 planetside exploration, the most hated part of that game.

Everything looks like plastic and everyone looks ugly (except male Ryder, for some reason). I can forgive most of the alien species looking similar, but all the asari look like the same person despite having human-like faces. It's really off-putting. And they must have run out of time to model the quarians, elcor, hanar, volus, drell, etc. since they're just not in the game (I am aware of the cancelled DLC - not a valid excuse).

You can really tell that the devs had no idea what made the original trilogy great and there's frequent ""easter eggs"" and references to the OT to remind you that it's a Mass Effect game, seemingly to trick you into thinking you're having fun. Half of the named characters you meet know someone from the OT.

The combat is changed completely from the OT, so if you enjoyed the cover-shooter of the OT you're shit out of luck. Despite Shepard basically having a personality that exists solely 2-dimensional paragon-renegade slider, there is still more role-playing in the OT than there is in Andromeda which gives Ryder 4 different personality dimensions to play with.
There is nothing in Andromeda that appeals to a Mass Effect fan except for, maybe, the Milky Way species (all of which have had their unique traits watered down). It doesn't look or feel like a Mass Effect game unless a salarian happens to be on-screen.

The only reason I played this game to completion was so that I could experience it first-hand. It's not as bad as people say it is, but it's close.
I really, really wish that they had let ME die with 3 and I have no faith in ME4.

While it received some criticism upon release, I believe that the game deserves a second look, as it delivers a truly enjoyable experience for fans of the sci-fi genre.

First and foremost, the vastness of the Andromeda galaxy is awe-inspiring. The game's open-world environments are visually stunning, filled with vibrant landscapes, intricate alien architectures, and breathtaking celestial bodies. The sense of exploration and discovery is heightened, as players navigate through uncharted territories, encountering strange new species and unraveling the mysteries of this new frontier.

Andromeda boasts a diverse and compelling cast of characters. From the charismatic and enigmatic Ryder siblings to the various crew members you recruit along the way, each character has their own unique story, personality, and motivations. Interacting with them through dialogue and engaging in their loyalty missions creates a sense of camaraderie and investment in their individual arcs.

The gameplay mechanics are a highlight of Andromeda. The fluid combat system offers a wide range of abilities, allowing players to customize their playstyle and experiment with different approaches. The introduction of the jetpack adds verticality to combat encounters, making battles more dynamic and strategic. Furthermore, the Nomad, a versatile all-terrain vehicle, enhances exploration and traversal across the vast landscapes, making each planet feel distinct and exciting to explore.

One of the game's strongest aspects is its deep lore and world-building. The Mass Effect universe is rich with history, politics, and complex interstellar relationships. Andromeda delves further into this lore, presenting players with a fresh perspective on the struggles of the Andromeda Initiative and the challenges faced by the Milky Way's inhabitants as they seek a new home. The overarching narrative, while not as tightly woven as previous entries, still manages to captivate players with its themes of exploration, colonization, and the consequences of humanity's actions.

The game's post-release support and updates have addressed many of the initial technical issues, improving facial animations and overall graphical fidelity. While the original release had its fair share of visual hiccups, the current state of the game is significantly more polished and immersive.

Furthermore, it's worth noting that Mass Effect: Andromeda introduced more inclusive romance options, including same-sex relationships for both male and female characters. While this is a positive step towards inclusivity, some players, particularly those looking for gay male romance options, may have found the available choices somewhat limited. It's understandable that fans had high expectations based on the robust romance options in previous Mass Effect games. Hopefully, future installments in the series will continue to expand and diversify romance options, allowing players to forge deeper connections and fully explore the relationships that resonate with them. Despite this small limitation, the overall representation and inclusion in Andromeda demonstrate the developers' commitment to fostering a more diverse and inclusive gaming experience.

Mass Effect: Andromeda offers an ambitious and exhilarating sci-fi experience. It may not reach the same heights as its predecessors, but it still manages to captivate players with its vast world, engaging characters, and exciting gameplay. If you approach Andromeda with an open mind and a desire for a new adventure in the Mass Effect universe, you're likely to find an enjoyable and immersive journey in the depths of the Andromeda galaxy.",1686614951,1686615003,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has some parts that are cool and the gunplay is better than other mass effects... But do not buy this game...

The early game is comprised of bad dialogue and the game is constantly repeating the exact same narrative down your throat. Be prepared to hear about ""We came to andromeda because..."" 80 times... 
A 5-10 minute cutscene could tell the entire backstory and be entertaining... Instead you are running from person to person for the next two hours being force fed the same story OVER and OVER again. If you hate that part of the game, refund it while you can. The game is exactly that but on a larger scale. Instead of running from room to room to get non-important dialogue. It will be planet to planet.

Then you finally get to the game, and start terreforming planets which starts out pretty good. The combat feels good, your leveling up and getting new abilities. But mid-late game it's go to this planet talk to 1 person, get off the planet go through 5 loading screens and go to the next planet to talk to this person. It gets old fast... There is no continuity between quests.
By this time you get tired of the cliche'. Oh you need to go through the door for a mission, it will be locked and you need to use your sam to hack a control pannel for the 900th time.
It's just very repetitive in the worst ways.

By end game all these late game quests that have been building up... PAY OUT FOR NOTHING! Seriously, nothing.
You just spent all game gathering supplies for this movie night, it is a very boring cutscene.
You got Ja'al his electric sensor thing, no one even uses it.
You got popcorn, non one eats it.
Drack made some Krogan liquor, doesn't exist in the final cut scene. 
You have spent at least 2-3 hours to do all these miniquests... And it's the most boring cutscene with no teambuilding or character development. 

Same goes for loyalty missions...
You have a loyalty mission finale, it's a 30 second cutscene. That's it. spend 2 minutes in loading screens for a forgetable 30 second cut scene. ""Hey rider, race me here"" you watch them race... End of cut scene.... 
WHAT!! I just spent 15 minutes traveling to this spot to have a loyalty mission, and it's a 30 second cutscene that MEANS NOTHING! It's annoying.

Now you are in late game, by this time you just want to see all the choices you made pan out...
THEY DO NOT! Your choices you made in the game do not matter. You never fight the final bad guy, you just hack some things and bam, games over. 
All the choices you made have 0 effect on the ending.
You never found all the pathfinders? Who cares, you get the same ending.
You are a logical instead of emotional pathfinder... Who cares, the ending is the same.


The entire game is ""Run over here, WAIT, go back to where you came from, now run over here..."" It never stops with the running around.
Then you get your SAM, ever get in a tight pickle, don't worry SAM saves the day.



And lastly, THE CHARACTERS! First off the majority of the voice acting is crap. Especially for the female Krogans you meet.

Cora, PeeBee, Liam, Gil are all CRAP writing. 1 dimensional and annoying.
 PeeBee starts out interesting but falls flat quickly. Turn into an annoying character. Kill her ex-lover, has no effect on the game. Let her live, no effect on the game. PeeBee is a ""I am quirky to put emotional barriers up"". It's annoying after a few hours. And despite her loyalty missions, nothing changes. 
Cora is the most annoying out of them all, some weird chick who wanted to be the Human Pathfinder but she thinks she is an Asari and will never shut up about it. I am serious, her entire dialogue, loyalty mission and even random lines is all about her being an asari huntress. Everything, and I mean everything she says is about being an asari huntress, and how the asari are amazing.
Liam will constantly be messing EVERYTHING up, not even for comedic relief, he just naturally messes everything up. And your only dialogue options are ""it's okay liam""... Liam creates a HUGE inter-species issue... ""It's okay liam"". Liam gets your entire crew caught in an ambush by doing something illegal that will destroy inter-species relations.... ""it's okay liam"". Your entire dialogue with Liam is him acting like a 5 year old, and you telling him that he is a good person.
Gil, same as liam. Constantly tearing apart your ship and picking fights with others for no damn reason. While you can side with someone else... Don't worry in 30 minutes you will have a forced cutscene to say Gil was correct for destroying your ship. Exact same issues as Liam. Gil is liam with less dialogue... Just like Liam, Gil is always right and you can never punish them or get made at them. Both these characters I wanted to kick off my ship. 
And for what ever reason the game forces you to hate who ever Gil is picking a fight with, instead of just throwing Gil off the ship. 
Get rid of Gil and Liam and majority of the problems on the tempest would be solved.


Then you have okay characters. 
Ja'al, Vetra. Suvi
Ja'al is a cliche' indigenous character. You can really tell the writers are mainly 20 somethings straight out of college with no real world experience. Ja'al is mellow, loves nature, blah, blah, blah. Think of a cliche' indigenous personality, and you have Ja'al to a T. He is one dimensional, but at least his writing is consistent and makes sense. If it wasn't for nearly everyone else being crap, no one would like him.
Vetra, vetra gets the closest to good out the female companions you can bring on missions. Yeah she can become a little 1d some times. But she is decent.
Suvi, she has very little dialogue options for a male ryder(what I played as). But the dialogue she does have is always meaningful or memorable and despite her limited dialogue she was at least unique and made sense.

The best characters.
Drack, Lexi. Kallo
Drack, drack is the closest to any character that actually has personality and makes sense. He gets mad at your decisions for very valid reasons. Despite being an old Krogan who has survived 1,000 years of war... He is not constantly throwing it in your face, he actually talks about other things.
In another mass effect he would be average at best. But among a cast of annoying 1d characters. He shines.
That being said, this is still andromeda. He forgets he was ever mad at you in 5 seconds. Your choices have no long lasting effects on him.

Lexi, the closest thing to a fleshed out female character in the game. She is a doctor who has a moral quagmire with doctor patient relationship. Constantly in turmoil over her role as a doctor for elite special forces and wanting everyone to stay alive. It is a good little break from the bland other characters. But I think the limited dialogue helps her character out, because with more dialogue she would become another Cora, Liam, or Gil.

Kallo, your pilot, a nice little Salarian who actually has personality. I liked every dialogue I had with Kallo. But I think that the limited dialogue helped him as well. If given more dialogue he could have been another annoying 1d character. 
But where he is, Kallo shines. In my opinion Kallo felt the absolute closest to a real crew member on your entire ship. 
He was constantly mad at the people I was mad at, for all the stupid crap they did. I think that made me like Kallo even more. He was the only other person on the Tempest who could see the writing and character arcs were crap. 



But there you have it, mass effect andromeda. Spend the entire game running from loading screen to loading screen. Any difficult story moment is solved by your SAM, and the companions you have are crap. You will be bringing Drack along for every mission to get away from all the annoying dialogue. And at the end of the game, you will have the largest letdown you have ever had. A story that concludes in a few short cut scenes that never touches on any of your decisions.

There was no need for multiplayer for this type of game! BioWare should've focused more on SP; they would probably earn far more money.

If you go in expecting another Shepard Mass Effect Triology you will be disappointed.

Is that a bad thing for THIS game?

No.

I write this from the perspective of now being mostly bug free and after the patches.

No one denies this game was not acceptable at the start.

But now...it is good.

It has the Mass Effect background vibes.

But it is a NEW story all by itself.

The story is nice, there is much exploration, combat get a real ""lift"" (pun intended) with jump jets, the companions are likable (although Liam get's on my nerves).

You can see it has much in common with Dragon Age 3 on some fetch quests but the whole package of missions tells a nice story.

This game was always released as a so to say ""new side Mass Effect"".

It sets the beginning of a new story.

That you see as plenty of lore and story is introduced.

It is a shame this story ends as there will be no new continuation.

Mass Effect Andromeda is better than the thrashing it gets - now.

Give it a try.

Story is interesting and kinda fun but kinda lacks the soul of the first 3 games. Drack makes up for that and I'd like to give a shout out to the devs for not making PB flat as a blue board.

1) Main bug I've noticed is that if you need to alt-tab or push the special/windows key to get rid of a notification that refuses to go away (especially the ones from the EA program), the game exits fullscreen, performance plummets and it won't allow to use fullscreen until you relaunch the game. This is especially annoying (maybe almost as much as Liam's character) if you aren't near your router when playing and the internet disconnects.

Don't like the idea of multiplayer integrated into the game because I'm antisocial but to each their own, I suppose. It's avoidable; EA bs isn't however, and you can't play the game with steam in offline mode. VPN works fine, at least after installing the EA 3rd party launcher.

While you won't get the rush (or frustration) like you might experience running insanity on Me2 or Me3, it is pretty satisfying to be able to jump and setup angles for a biotic charge.

The story lacks the epic feel of the trilogy but its not like you had multiple games to develop attachments to key characters.  There's a turian who is great but she's not archangel.  Drack provides the ""krogan"" experience, keeping in line with what you'd expect but also bringing a bit of his own personality.  While the doctor asari is a bit like Liara, Peebee definitely is not.  The key to enjoying Andromeda has really been not expecting it to be Me4, at least for me.

At the end of the day it's a good game with an interesting story and familiar mechanics from previous games in the series. However as you play through it, at times you can notice remnants of the notoriously bad facial animations, unpolished game mechanics and a lack of certain much needed quality of life features.

If I had to say something positive that the game improved upon, the first thing that comes to my mind is more inclusive romance options more akin to Dragon Age series than Mass Effect. In the first game you only have an option to romance someone of the opposite gender with the exception of Liara, a member of a mono-gender race asari. In the second game all the ""main"" love interests are once again only available for the opposite gender with the addition of three secondary ones, two of which are asari in order to find a loophole around ""gay romances"". The rumours say, certain characters such as Jack and Tali were originally supposed to be bi, but with the majority of Mass Effect's target demographic being straight men, they ended up removing that option in order to avoid backlash. The third game improves on this a little with everyone's favourite, [spoiler]possibly deceased[/spoiler] Kaidan from the first game discovering that he's actually into men as well.

Anyways I feel like Andromeda had a lot of potential, but as all things with EA, short term profits come first and the game was rushed and eventually abandoned.

Characters: Cora is unbearable. She is beyond bland and actually just painful to be with sometimes. Shes a submissive, confused, yet always bragging white woman with the bland haircut nobody likes.

Open World: Literally empty. There is just nothing to do. Playing the game feels like a chore beyond comprehension. I am forcing myself to play just to finish the series. The only good open world is Havaral, probably because the Nomad isn't involved. The Nomad has no gameplay or combat making those sections unbearable.

When it first launched it had so many hilarious bugs that made YouTube.  Today, I'd say most bugs are gone.  It runs smoothly on my system with a 1060 6GB card on high settings at 1440p.

It introduces so many characters, a new galaxy, new enemy--laying the groundwork for a hopeful second installment.  I enjoyed another chapter of the Mass Effect universe.  And that is exactly what this is--another chapter--another story.  If you walk into this 5 year old game with that mindset you will love this game.

[i]-Peebee is goofy and beautiful
-Good character customization, for you and your brother
-Map design is astonishing, maps are diverse, big, full of detail. The Vaults really are something else.
-Phenometal graphics, the Frostbite engine is really awesome.
-Whoever had the idea of the suit boosters to jump around and make traversing easier deserves a raise for sure. 
-Whenever you enter a dark area you feel your characters eyes adapting to the darkness.
-(1)The whole space exploration stuff in real time is great, a lot of detail but...
-You can change companions on outposts, thats good.
-I really like that you can customize the color of your outfits.
-Controls are great, feels good to move around and jump.
-Overall entertaining side quests.
-They brought back the exploration freedom you had on ME1!
-Companions have funny chats while on the rover with you.
-Like the vaults, makes my brain use some brain cells for a change. 
-Good skill customization, you can be techie, biotics and assault at the same time. 
-I have the game on a hdd and loads pretty fast, also good performance when loading new stuff.
-The final battle and epiloge are on another level, one of the best game endings i have seen. 
-Although traversing between planets to 100% each galaxy can be tedious after a while, the level of detail each planet has is awesome.
-Even with the melee system being what it is, the asari sword that vanishes you on attack its cool as heck, the Krogan hammer too.
[/i] 

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[i]-Lighting is good overall but there are flickering and some times when you get in dark areas its glitchy as hell.
-Your omni tool can interact with alien stuff never seen before just like that? no extra stuff needed? hmmm i dont think so. You also use your omni tool for everything, even petting animals.
-Physics are not so great. You cant run over stuff with your rover, and the rover lacks a gun! bring the mako backkkkkkkkkkkkkk. When you try to run over an enemy it just glitches and the wheels goes over like if he was a rock, some times you do damage but rarely
-IMO the monolith puzzles are a waste of time.
-Some conversations are cut short by other stuff, missing out on that because you moved too far while hearing a conversation, most of the time when a conversation starts you have 2 stay in place and continue when its over or risking a new one starting and cutting off the one you hearing. 
-(1) it takes to long and you cant skip travel between constelations. When you backtracking for sidequests it gets boring. 
-Lacks companion customization and you start with the toggle option to remove companions helmets off, so you walking around with full EVA suit and they just walking over there sniffing radiation. Took me a while to find out that was a togglabe option.
-UI its messy and overwhelming at first. Its just doesnt feel good when using it even when you figure everything out.
-YOU CANT CHANGE WEAPONS ON THE FLY, jesus thats awfull, you have to go to an outposts every time you want a new weapon or change to the weapon just looted.
-They made the ammo variants (incendiary & cryo) A CONSUMABLE, WHAT DA HELLLLLL.
-Melee its a key you use, not a weapon, also you freeze on place when using melee and you only deal damage on 1 way. 
-Conversation camera its horrible, it bugs and some times doesnt set correctly so u watching a wall while having a conversation.
-The npcs look like furniture on some places, they just stand there, even when you do a quest a choose an option that goes against them, they just stand there watching you. Not even a chair for them to sit just standing.
-Extra missions arent cataloged by planet, thats messy and annoying to find.
-The architects fights are boring, just run around until he exposes a weak spot, and some times you have to wait like 6 minutes for that, just running around avoiding shots... horrible.
-You cant board the tempest on the planet and stay there, every time you enter you depart, thats annoying.
-There are some audio glitches too, turn the camera around or move an inch in some way and you become deaf to the dialog next to you.
-Poorly descripted weapon/armor mods, i have no idea what im adding to my weapon most of the time. WHAT THE HELL IS A COMBO DAMAGE AND WHEN DOEST IT TAKE PLACE.

OMG so i know it says I've played for 9 hours but its more like 3, i had it running in the background for a while.

So i originally started a male character cuz why not.  Figured he would be kind of like male Shepard.  No he was not!  I hated his personality so i had to remake as a female and at least she seems a bit better or her joking around seems to fit a women more but maybe thats just a preference.  What i was hit with pretty early on was a slew of unskippable cutscenes.  Like, why is that even a thing in this day and age i have no idea.   You should never be forced to listen to dialogue or watch something if you don't want to in case, like me, i am playing over again and I've already seen it.

Secondly i had some major problems.  Got to the end of the starter missions cutscene and the game decided to crash to main menu.  At that point i had already been forced to watch like 3 mins of this cutscene when it happened.  The game just decided the main menu was where i needed to be.  OK  whatever ill just boot it up and get back into it.  Nope.  The checkpoint system is hot garbage so i had to redo the entire section and part way through the game decided to drop audio completely.  OK whatever, at this point i had seen all this 2 times now but being forced to watch that long ass dialogue cutscene where there are some random ass choices thrown in to justify making me watch it was very annoying on top of the game being completely silent while i'm forced to watch it.  I'll include a really annoying bug where your cursor gets stuck outside of menus and you cant do anything at all.  You'd think some combination of opening up menus and closing them would fix it but it doesn't, then you might be lead into believing that going to the main menu might fix it, it doesn't.  Have to completely exit out of the entire game and go back in so you can actually do things again.  Like, this game came out a long time ago, why do bugs like this even exist?  Its an EA title i guess, so it makes sense.  Not like Bioware really exists anymore in there.  Bugs and restarts out of the way.....so far.


I thankfully paid only $5 for this game and even then i really feel like EA owes me money but the game play is still pretty good so whatever.  Its only $5

Unfortunately, i just came from the Mass Effect Legendary Edition and played all 3 games and in comparison to that, this game is really bad.  The story so far is really boring as it tries to cram way too much in too early.  This story is like trying to cook brisket quickly in a pan instead of the slow cooking over a low fire that the OT recieved.  The characters animations feel so lifeless most of the time and if it wasn't for the female voice actor doing a pretty decent job i don't know if id want to keep going.  :/  What happened........the mass effect trilogy is leagues above this game.

It is mass effect...kind of, if you squint.

Other than that, the game is mostly open world, in the sense that you can explore massive open areas, with little in the way to keep you from doing it, other than piss poor traction design for the buggy and a few annoyingly placed invisible walls. Also the jump you get, barely works. Yes you jump, but you carry very little velocity when doing it. So it's kinda just moves you upwards, instead of up and forwards, like most jumps in video games.

The only real problem I have with it, is that the mods barely work. Because the community basically abandoned it, a lot of the mod devs also stopped working on the mods for the game. So some of the mods that make the game better, no longer function.

Game is fun and boring at the same time, I personally can play it for multiple days, then get bored, stop playing for a few weeks to months, then come back and everything necessary to know is still remembered. Except the alien puzzle, because that was poorly explained to begin with, and it gets harder and harder the further you get into the game. You can skip them with ciphers, that can be bought from merchants.

4/10 can't recommend mostly bc of code issues and design flaws.

The good:
1:decent story
2:lots of roleplay side quests
3:combat is decent
4:The new Mako is the highlight of the game

The problems:
5:no quit to desktop button on death option
6:toggles out of fullscreen when minimized
7:required Soduku... just...why?
8:load times, especially when doing a RP story quest running around the station (load, run, talk, run, load, run, talk, run, repeat)
9: unskippable repeating video sequences. Even the tab to skip moving around a star system (the only time it is even offered) is only offered late in the video and doesn't skip the end of the video. just terrible. Takeoff and landing videos as well. Probably just covering load time problems
10: top down mission control is flawed. separating quests into categories when what you really want is them all grouped by planet. At least once the pin is actually wrong and requires you to find that out on the internet. never patched. meh.

Bonus problem: small rocks that kill your runspeed, jumps that kill your runspeed, NPC nobodies that get in your way and kill your runspeed.

Extra credit problem: research trees are big and totally unnecessary as weapons and mods are lying all over the place as well as being available for purchase with your endless funds. Ended up just being a lot of bloat.",1648194121,1685653926,False,0,0,0.507204592227935791,0,True,False,False

And it was disapointing.

For the good point, Some of the crew character are awesome, and the interaction between them can be great.
Story has really interesting plot that could be properly used.

But the bad point that overshadow the good ones.

 Gameplay is a faster than the previous one, but I'm not sure it's in a good way, and the jetpack is way too much important in the game.
Personnally, I didn't like the fact you can have all the classes however you want whenever you want.
They tried to give a justification, but Even on a lore point of view, it doesn't make sense, especially for the Biotics power.

And Graphically, well in my opinion it's worse, and I will always remember when I saw the first Turian, it was looking like a plastic toy you get from happy meal, all flat and smooth surfaces.

But the problem lies in the immersion.
You went from the original trilogy, where you needed to do important operation, in places where you can feel people could live here.
In Andromeda, it's just plain annoying running around and the map, and some of them require jetpack to get around, and you ask yourself ""Wait, the people living here... They all have and use jetpack to get around ?""

But what made me stop the game, is that you get random boring, secondary mission from NPC.
In the previous Mass Effect, Shepard is a military guy, a Spectre from the Citadel, and do what it need to save the world againt the reaper. And some of the mission you do for NPCs there is always an ulterior motive, a motive that will make the characters grows.
But in Adromeda you run random stupid errand, like getting movies, or gathering plant for making a new beverage, or getting some drugs for random high dude and that's it.
You are overflooded with random mission that feel like you're playing a random delivery boy.

And there are some idea, even with amazing moral dilemna !
[spoiler] My favorite was the one where people wanted to wake up their family and relative from hypersleep, and they are protesting to get that. Problem, there is not enough ressources for them. And it's up to you to decide what to do. But spoiler alert, it's changes nothing. and that's disapointing to say the least. [/spoiler]

Overall, I really didn't liked, everything that made Mass Effect is not here anymore, you just get a story that has potential, to get flooded with annoying un-impactful quests, where it changes nothing to do them or not.
If it's your first game to play, maybe you might enjoy it.

The story is more than disappointing. You go to generic citadel hub, generic pirate cove, generic snow planet, generic jungle one and generic alien resistance base. Everything is the most basic Sci-fi trope and there's nothing more. I swear the Angara homeworld looks so generic that it looks like that Humanities Gateway building in University of California, Irvine. Search it up lads and see for yourself.

I don't know how we ended up with this mess of a story. You know that new game Greedfall? You are the new colonial settlers there and you meet some underdog local clans offering you an olive branch. You take it and beat the baddies, but it turns out that the locals were just using you to beat their rivals. The locals have their own needs and wants and your naive innocent character was played like a fool for trusting someone for no reason.

In Andromeda, you are the new colonial settlers there and you meet some underdog locals offering you an olive branch. You take it and it turns out they are the generic resistance fighters and the baddies are just the baddies. The baddies just want to do bad things, for unclear reasons.

Remember in Mass Effect original trilogy, we were dealing with issues like the cultural impacts of past military conflicts, how the two peoples once went to war make peace with each other. We were witnessing the influence of birth control policies and debating the boundary between preserving basic human (alien I guess) rights and combating the disastrous results of overpopulation. Yeah the third game was kind of bad but even there we were seeing things like the results of deindustrialization. We were seeing how a society so advanced that its economy now relies on finance, technology, and tourism deals with a total war that suddenly requires boots on the ground.

It was good. It was great. It was one of a kind. It was art, art that made me feel something in a way not any different from a painting of Goya. Andromeda doesn't do that. Andromeda has generic alien planet that looks like the University of California.

To give credit where it's due, the game play is enjoyable. It is less team-based but more of a proper action shooter and it is better than most Sci-fi action RPGs.

But that's it. 

If you like the combat so much, go play Anthem. Don't encourage them to do more of this. This is how art dies, not by someone coming in and destroying all good sculptures and novels and paintings and films to leave us with only fingerpaintings by toddlers, but by having the people praise mediocrity as the new masterpiece.

Where do we even begin... Lets start with positive traits, the one, that almost made this review positive. ALMOST

1. Its another product in Mass Effect universe, sure would love to see more of that
2. Tons of content, billion sidequests
3. Gameplay-wise overall feels satisfying in almost every aspect - from jumping with jumpsuit to shooting and even driving vehicle is somehow decent.
4. Bioware repetative formula is still here. Some people like it, some dont. By that I mean that Kadara is actually same old Omega, Voeld is basically Noveria and Havarl is night version of Virmire. I guess its kinda hard to get with entirely new concepts, but in bioware case its not only planet design, pretty sure u get what I mean, my dear chosed ones fellow Spirit Monks/Spectres/Pathfinders/Grey Wardens. Still though, never sad its bad thing. 
5. Fast travel mechanic is convinient.

Negative traits:
1. This is actually main reason why this review is thumbs down - oh, Keelah, WHERE THE FUCK ARE QUARIANS? U bring two entirely new races (even though first one is ripoff of Twiileks, and second is ripoff of your own collectors), u brought billion of romancable asaris, u brought those boring as hell salarians, and who the fck needs quarians? You ingame explanation that they could build ship sucks balls because, well yeah, quarians are nomads, it makes perfect sence FOR THEM to go through dark space to find potential new home. Flotilla would put some emissaries on other species arks, if there really were technical difficulties. Just fuck you bioware, for real.
2. Technical issues - even now, after 6 years this game isnt optimized. FPS drops, npc dropping through textures, you falling through textures, npc fly into space during dialogue, eyes rolling like they have their own life - if you can think about any glitch - there`s high possibility you`ll encounter it here.
3. Companions AI - its worse than in 16-years old first chapter of Mass Effect. They are just beyond useless. Maybe it isnt issue on normal difficulties, but on insanity you are basically on your own.
4. Planets scanning is still boring, but still there, now with thankfully skippable cutscenes of travelling between them.
5. Your protagonist is stupid clown, deal with it.

Knowing bioware formula, I can guess I have completed nearly 70% of campaing as for know, so I can`t judge ending yet, but I hope it will not add to negative traits, but concidering this is still last game so far - I have bad feeling.",1684930853,1684930853,False,0,0,0.39682537317276001,0,True,False,False

Honestly this game actually has a beautiful story, massive amount of content, rich and well written characters and intense and fun combat/game play. I really wish they didn't release the game in a poor state and they gave it another year because now I doubt that we'll ever see more from the Andromeda universe. Originally when this game first came out I was extremely excited being a Mass Effect fan and then proceeded to quickly drop this game before I really ever gave it a chance because there were so many problems with it and the first 5-8 hours of story/characters was just kind of bland. But with those gripes aside, TODAY, I absolutely recommend it. Like I mentioned, the game is filled to the brim with content, interesting story lines and missions, great dialogue between companions and has a high replay ability.

I played on the hardest difficulty like I do with most games, especially the mass effect series since I've been playing the games since the first one came out back in 2007. This game was probably the hardest of the 4 Mass Effects games, with every fight and encounter, I had to approach things carefully because one normal guy with a gun was able to kill me in just a few shots and within seconds. Several encounters I was forced to leave and come back later. I had to use my companions to their fullest, take advantage of any combo detonations we could get off, use cover tactfully and always watch my flank. It wasn't until I was around Level 40+ with the best gear that I was able to ease up on the combat and I loved the challenge. You can get to the end of the game way before 40 if you skip most of the content but for reference I beat the game (with every side quest finished) at Level 58. The amount of variations into character building was awesome, I wasn't forced to pick a specific class from the start and continue on, I was able to mold my character to exactly the way I wanted with each progressing level and the profiles that your AI provides was the cherry on top of that sweet cake. Another thing that made the game even more challenging was that you cant save anywhere near combat, and the auto saves were brutal which made dying that more frustrating. I both liked and disliked that feature, some really challenging areas I just wanted to save scum my way through and was annoyed that I couldn't but it made the game more satisfying to conquer. 

The amount of dialogue in this game is mind-boggling, with most lines being delivered and voice acted very well. I say that but admittedly the voice acting of Scott and Sara are kind of bad. Maybe that's just because I compare them to Commander Shepard but why wouldn't I. The fact that new conversations would happen depending on which two companions I brought along was one of my favorite little insights into the game. I played as Sara Ryder because her character had more depth than her brother Scott when it came to the voice acting and because Scott could never match up to the almighty Commander Shepard. Sara felt fresh and new and fell right into her role as this very green soldier taking after her fathers footsteps. My two favorite companions were Drack (the 1,400+ year old Krogan who lived during the Krogan Rebellions) and Jaal (the new Angaran companion who represented the new species found in the Andromeda Galaxy.) With that said, most combinations of any two characters worked well in combat regardless of what profile I was running and all characters were written really well, although it did take awhile to actually care about anyone and some companions were still downright annoying at times, everyone's entrance into the crew felt half-baked or rushed, kind of like in Mass Effect 1. Honestly, outside the combat and the challenge, it took awhile for me to care about anyone at all, the start of the game is pretty bland and I can see why many people drop the game under 8-10 hours of game play. Takes too long for things to pick up but it does really pick up. The music and the universe look and sound as fantastic as the Remastered Trilogy. 

The story line was really good with me invested into the Andromeda Initiative right away but it did take awhile for me to be invested into the Ryder Family and to be invested into any of the characters. But creating new outposts, exploring these open world new planets and making sense of the Remnant Technology to make these planets habitable was great and well done in its polished state. The main antagonist wasn't anything special but became special after unraveling the mystery behind the Kett empire and their intentions. The final mission was an absolute banger being a more satisfying ending than Mass Effect 3. The only issue I probably had with it was that there was no final stand off between me and the Kett Leader, rather just another very challenging mission with hordes of enemies. The cut scenes were done very well and were all beautiful, I just wish I could skip them at times, especially the ones coming and going from planet to planet or system to system, cool to see at first, annoying after I've returned to the planet for the 20th time.

Now for some other bad things. When this game first came out it was an absolute mess, with its biggest complaint being that everybody had zero textures on their face. For the most part that's been resolved but it still fades in and out every now and then, for example, with Drack looking like a bad ass one second and then like a plastic toy dino the next. This happens with other characters too but not as frequently or as jarring as it was in 2017. Also some of the faces Sara/Scott makes while in simple conversation are just baaaad. You can absolutely tell these problems are the remnants of a rushed project. Most Asari also lack texture and just look baaaad, especially in comparison to its predecessors which I don't even know how you mess that up. Rarely in certain areas the screen will blip in and out which can be especially annoying in combat, other rare issues with combat is like your dodge not moving you anywhere, or you getting killed while using the scroll wheel to place a buff or change weapon which is supposed to stop time. The only other bad things I can think of is unskipable cut scenes, like, all dialogue can be skipped, moving your ship from planet to planet in the galaxy map can be skipped, I don't understand why they left the system to system animation unskipable and the cut scenes from entering/ leaving an outpost or the nexus. Another issue that has been resolved was earlier this year the game was forced to open with the EA app instead of the origin app and when the change first came out, the game wouldn't even work and even the Mass Effect Remastered Trilogy suffered from that change, just another thing rushed out and then fixed later. Classic EA. From my understanding those issues have been fixed and I didn't run into any problems the past month. For these to be my only problems with the game (and the fact we'll probably never see a sequel) and for most of them to be rare problems is actually huge in comparison to the buggy and ugly mess they gave us on launch.

Beautiful masterpiece of a game that can finally sit proudly next to the original 3 in my heart. 8/10",1684289563,1684727106,True,6,0,0.53930211067199707,0,True,False,False

Then stop. Just stop. Set your expectations accordingly - this is not a great game, it's not a good Mass Effect and it will not give you the same joy and pleasure as the original trilogy did.

However, although not great, this game is fun. Lot's of fun. The gameplay/combat is the best in the entire franchise, period. The setting is nice. Customization is okay. But the story is bland, most of the companions are really meh (they are okay in the end but the protagonist is really, really bad) and the amount of wasted potential in general will leave a bad taste in your mouth.

Think of this game as the equivalent of Hitman Absolution to the Hitman franchise; was it a bad Hitman? Most definitely. Was it a bad game? Not at all. Yes facial expressions are shit and it can be a little clunky, but damn you can have a lot of fun here - if you, once again, just set your expectations according to what you are getting here: A nice and fun game, but a really bad franchise entry.

It's truly not that bad. What destroyed this game at launch, more than the weird animation and ugly models, is that it didn't hold a candle to the original trilogy - but if you're able to get past that, maybe install an asari face mod or two, you can really get an enjoyable experience, but understand that it's polarizing for a reason!

The combat is tons of fun; you have three distinct skillsets of tech, biotics, and combat. You can pick a pre-made class and change on the fly, or create your own loadout with a varying mix of these skills. This is wonderful for engaging and ever-changing combat, but easily allows you to cheese most fights. It is completely optional of course and you can be like me and maintain just one class. The companions are alright; I think Jaal and Vetra are delights and Drack is reminiscent of Wrex. I find the human squadmates to be initially dislikable, though.

I found the story to be nonsensical. There was so much padding between story missions that I gradually lost the plot doing side missions because it was underwhelming and hardly engaging. The mysteries intrigued me, but there was no real payoff.I understand it was meant to also be a trilogy so the story feels unfinished... because it is. There is no real closure, not unless they make a sequel. 

It suffers from the Inquisition dilemma where the hub worlds can feel bloated at times, with a vast and beautiful landscape with so much to do yet nothing all at the same time. I enjoyed exploring the beautiful planets, but they were much too massive to be that empty. It's a shame the team was shuffled around the way they were during development, but accounting for all of that, it truly isn't that bad. It isn't the successor we wanted, but it's the successor we got, and I'm going to make the best out of it :)

Initially I was excited at the concept: to have a much more open world experience with these new graphics and fun community systems where you upgrade your colony. On paper it looks great, but in execution it falls short. I'm surprised myself at how much I miss the linear mission-based style of the earlier trilogy, and I think for me what pinpointed the big difference is the lack of character development. 

----------------------------Spoilers---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the earlier trilogy, you had gorgeous unique models of characters that clearly defined them all as their own identities, and the frequent use of cutscenes created a feeling of watching a movie, but also showing character relationships and personalities with fun action packed in. The plot was engaging and the control mechanics became more intuitive as the games were released.

In Andromeda, the initial missions lead you to having your dad die (an event with absolutely no emotion as you hardly interact with him from the beginning), and this big pointless quest chain of talking to an ai who wants to ""tell you important things about your dad""  leaves me thinking ""why do I care?"" There is some sort of potential story going on with your sibling being stuck in cryostasis, but this is carried out in an uninteresting and dull way. Aside from the typical criticisms about the poor emotional expression in the npcs, the other thing that is glaringly noticeable is the lack of effort put into making the characters unique. From a physical standpoint, all Asari have the same face model, with the only differences being shallow markings. The alien races, while somewhat unique, are also seemingly just carbon copies of each other (yes I said it, all these aliens look alike!). In the original trilogy, you could easily tell the difference between Liara and Samara, and you could tell the developers really put thought into having defining characteristics of each character physically and personality-wise. Overall the character designs are just...odd. From the get-go, I didn't like the main character proportions (I played as a male). The character models all looked short and stumpy from their proportions: long torsos, short legs, that kind of thing. If you compare, you can clearly see there is a difference in proportions of characters between Andromeda and the trilogy.

This is a good example of most aspects of the game. I really like the updates in mechanics and abilities, and the movement feels much more fluid (even with the weird running glitches), but the whole game just feels really...hollow. There is very little meaningful emotion to it, and the characters don't have interesting dynamics or growth. 16 hours into the game and I've been really trying just to ""care"" about any of the characters or what's happening to them. There is a glaring lack of emotional buildup or having the players develop interest in the main character and his story. It just throws you right into it all and expects you to just have a fun run-and-gun adventure when what made me appreciate the trilogy so much was the team you worked with and how their stories all coincided with each other.

This game has a lot of interesting story points that could have been really great, but it just feels like playing a shell of a game. The events are lackluster in how they are portrayed, and your squad just isn't much of a cohesive team of interesting people with intricate relationships the way it feels in the ME trilogy. I've had this game installed for months, but have only had interest in playing it a few times at best, to the point of just not feeling much interest in returning to it. I hope the writers/designers of the next game learn from these drawbacks.",1684259300,1684260136,False,3,0,0.526460528373718262,0,True,False,False

Gambling is bad, making repeat purchases to try to get one item is called stringing your customers out into consumers. In my grand opinion, EA/Bioware should make a cosmetics store and sell those for side cash as the boxes tend to kill interest in playing.

Instead of cash for random items that -may- have what you want, maybe offer players rewards for time played. I've played ME 1 through 3 dozens of times, met the creators at the Edmonton Comicon years back and am a solid fan of this game series. Andromeda feels more like a ME:3 reskin than an independant game, not that the jump jets and new functions/abilities aren't fun to use!

I'd even go as far as to say it's pretty good - definitely better than I expected it to be, after hearing all the negative reviews - but it's plagued by 3 very big and hard-to-ignore issues that drag it down:

[h3]1. It's buggy as hell.[/h3]
Bugs, glitches, freezes, crashes, more bugs. This game has it all - and since EA has abandoned its development due to the poor reception, these bugs are never going to be fixed. The result is... frustrating. I had to restart the game or load a save plenty of times - at least once per session. I had to tab out and google how to get through bugged quests every now and then, I had great story moments ruined by visual or audio glitches - not to mention the facial animations that will occassionally be straight up horrifying.
This does not make the game unplayable. None of the bugs are straight-up game breaking, and at some point I just kinda got used to them - but in the first few hours, I definitely considered giving up on the game because of this.

[h3]2. A formulaic open world.[/h3]
You could argue ME:A is a product of its time, as 2017 was pretty much the peak of ""open world fever"" where pretty much every game had to be a massive open world - many filled with repetitive side activies, large empty areas, boring fetch quests and very little actual substance.
ME:A is no different. The one plus-side is that driving the Nomad [i]is[/i] actually pretty fun, definitely way more fun than the Mako was in ME1, but other than that... the open world doesn't add much. It mostly detracts, as the pacing of this story-focused game really suffers when the side-quests force you to go back-and-forth across the cluster many, many times.
You don't have to fully engage with the open world and do all of the side activies (I did most, but some were too boring to pursue), but you do have to do quite a lot of it in order for your outposts to thrive - which is... pretty much the goal. 
I hope, at least, that they will learn from this and not force an open world on the next Mass Effect game.

[h3]3. It's Mass Effect.[/h3]
Honestly, this might be the game's biggest problem. I believe reception would have been much, much better had it been developed by some euro-jank company, like Spiders for example, and was set in a different-but-similar universe. It would have been called ""a love letter to Bioware's best era"" or something like that.
But it's a Mass Effect game, developed by Bioware, published by EA, and it's expected to live up to the extremely high standards of its predecessor... and it's not even remotely close to doing it.
Even if you come in knowing this and actively choosing to judge it by its own merits, comparisons to the original trilogy are hard to avoid. The structure of the story is similar, the new enemy race employ a tactic that is ridiculously close to what the Reapers did, and the game will throw various cameos your way to tie it in to the universe - you'll hear recordings of Liara, you'll meet relatives of beloved Normandy crew members, and you'll spend way too much time scanning random planets and thinking ""This was the worst part of ME2.  Why did they bring this mechanic back? Who asked for this?""
And once these comparisons inevitably pop in your head, and you'll realize the original trilogy comes out on top every time, it makes it much harder to appreciate Andromeda on its own.

There are many more complaints I have about this game outside these major three, but this is a positive review, so I'll keep them to myself and move on to why I chose to recommend it after all.

[h2]So why is it actually good?[/h2]
[h3]1. Combat is a lot of fun.[/h3]
While it's a lot less tactical than the originals - with no tactical pause nor a way to directly control your squad's use of powers - combat is still really fun. It's very fluid, highly customizeable, fast paced, and the ability to jump and hover make it more vertical than any Mass Effect combat system before, which adds a whole new dimension to it. 
The powers are pretty much the ones you're used to from Mass Effect 3, and damage types work the same - Fire is good against armor, electricty against shields, everything else against health.  I guess they went with the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" approach here, and it was the right choice.

[h3]2. The story is... actually pretty good.[/h3]
Not all of it. There is a lot I didn't like. A lot of it feels awkward, like it's some weird Mass Effect fan-fiction, written by someone who didn't really pay that much attention to the existing lore. A lot of it ends up making the classic ""telling, not showing"" mistake - For example, the new alien race you meet, The Angara, will tell you their people are naturally very open about their emotions (what a weird thing to tell the first alien race you just met, seeing as you have no other sapient race to compare to), and this ""fact"" is mentioned many times throughout, but you never really see it. They basically act like humans do - some are open about their feelings, others are very stoic and keep them to themselves. If the game didn't repeatedly say this, I wouldn't even consider that ""being open about their emotion"" is something this race could be known for. They're just humans with weird tentacles on their faces.
Which is another problem with the story - This new galaxy, millions of light years away, is... basically the same as ours. Life has developed the exact same way, the Angaran society is almost identical to human society. They live in houses, they drink in bars, the communicate verbally, and they walk on two legs and have two arms which they use to fight with guns. It just feels so lazy - you had the opportunity to create something really unique, and you just... went with the same.

And yet... I enjoyed the story, because the core of it is in the right place. While Ryder can't hold a candle to Shepard, she (or he - but mine was a she) is likeable and relatable, and the dialogue lets you personalize her more than you could with Shepard's stoic military persona. The crew of the Tempest, while - again - absolutely can't match the crew of the Normandy, are genuinely pretty great. They really grew on me. They're rich characters, interesting, and different to what we've seen before. Loyalty missions are multi-step missions that gradually build the characters up and by the end the crew really feels like one big family. 
Your choices do seem to have an impact, though I don't know how much things actually change. The final mission was a really fun, climactic event that brought all of your choices together in one big moment and was the closest any game has come to feeling like the final mission of Mass Effect 1, which is one of my favorites ever.


By the end of the game, I was genuinely upset that this is all we're getting. All planned sequels or DLCs have been canceled - which is a real shame because some of what was teased at the end of this game seemed really cool. I would have genuinely liked to spend more time with these characters, and see where all of the unresolved story threads were going to take us.

Compared to the trilogy there are actually multiple interesting romance options to explore if you want to.

        [td]This is not a Mass Effect game. This is a terrible scifi action shooter masquerading as a Mass Effect game. The game is a failure from a technical standpoint as the game is very buggy and broken. The game is a failure from a gameplay standpoint as the gameplay is both boring and mindless. The game is a failure from a story perspective as the story reads like it is a Mass Effect fanfic that was written by a teenage girl from deviantart. Avoid this failure of a game.[/td]

It starts very slow and while I try my hardest to not compare it to the original trilogy of games the lack of polish across the board and numerous glitches really hurts this one especially for me. I loved the setting and story for the first half but by the end I had crossed into being more relieved that it was over. Your party members are done very well. There is a ton of (mostly) interesting back and forth between all of them and plenty about them for you to personally discover about them. Ultimately I do not recommend this game as the bad makes even the good parts seem less so. It had potential but is just disappointing. One playthrough was more than enough.

There is a lot of side stuff to do in every zone but they're also just vast empty wastelands at the same time. Navigating them in the vehicle provided had me wishing for the Mako from ME1. The writing and last half of the main questline are very poor though. The voice acting ranges from good to jarringly bad at times sounding like they recorded their lines in a tunnel with an old 90s cell phone several feet away or the occasional ear piercingly loud ones. The glitches were plentiful but none of them ever made me lose much time, typically under a minute if anything. Falling through the world, party members floating up through the ship becoming inaccessible, enemies not falling over or respecting walls, and some others.

[b]I. Was. Wrong.[/b]

The game takes place much into the future from where ME:3 ended. With no communication between the two galaxies, the people in ME:A have no idea what happened in the Milky Way. For all ME:A people know, the life on Milky Way could have been wiped out by the Reapers. 
This makes it possible for the devs to have a clean start at a potential new series. But not the game-making experience though.

The game mechanics are far superior compared to the original trilogy. The game physics, the graphics, and even the voice-acting are much better than before.

The storyline is solid. Good world-building, with tons of side quests to keep you occupied for hours together as you learn and explore what the game offers. But, I do have to admit that the stakes did not feel as high as it did in the original series. Even ME:1 had higher stakes than ME:A. So, this combined with the lack of consequences to your actions, the game does fall short with the story experience. I found myself casually playing the final mission rather than in a thrilling sort of tense play.

All said and done, the devs have said that there will be another game. I'm hopeful about it. I hope that they improve the story experience without breaking what already worked great.

Now for the bad news, Frosty Mod Manager stopped working for the game because of the platform switch from Origen to Electronic Arts! Frosty seems to work fine, but It does not inject your Mod list into to the game.
If you use Steam as your platform the game still goes thru the Electronic Arts loop and you end up with two sets of files; even if you utilize the Origin's remnant file as your download path for either Steam or Electronic Arts.
The game without Mods does play differently and is less fun. Until The Modding Community and/or Electronic Arts find a workaround solution to the Frosty Manager problem players will have to play it in its Original Default Format.
Still, play it and have fun doing it!

Absolutely loved the trilogy and then went into this game not being sure what to expect.

You play as a different character, with a different cast which at the start I had such a difficult time appreciating as I missed Shepard and Garrus and basically everything seeing as it basically was so recently experienced. The one thing I enjoyed from the get go was the gameplay and how it all worked out.

Over time I grew accustomed to the new cast and got to enjoy the game for what it is. Now I have a second cast I love from the Mass Effect series (excluding Cora and Suvi but whatever) which makes me a bit sad that they're likely to not make a proper sequel to this game (at least not based on what the ME5 trailer reveals but we won't know until more info is given). I'm so going to miss Jaal.

Anyway, I definitely recommend this game, it has a good story that is being told, relatively great romance (even gay ones to some degree (does feel like an afterthought though)), great characters (Jaal is by far the best) and great gameplay, all of which are inspired from the original Trilogy , which went into a somewhat different direction.",1683283872,1683283872,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is an amazing game, that is very unique and wonderfully designed. I love the story, the art, the battle system, the overall layout and gameplay. All very top notch. The story is really great and it's a lot of fun to play. However, I would have to recommend that God's people stay away from this game, because like so many other great titles, there is a heavy influence to partake in practices that are unclean in God's eyes. In particular there is a heavy presence of influence toward homosexuality, as well as pre-marital sex. Also, there is the presence of false religion, and in at least one case a side quest which requires the player to permit an NPC to conduct a prayer to a false god on behalf of the player. The foundation of this false religion is reincarnation, which is spiritism, which is demonism. It's very unfortunate, because otherwise it seemed to be a very Christian friendly game, and was really fun to play.

Fun, modern design, enjoyable combat, heaps of quests, runs great at 1440p 120 fps.

Couple of things I'll point out in particular.

Taking enemy bases is good fun. Enemy spawns are logical (i.e reinforcements get drop shipped in which is way better than magically popping enemies out of nowhere).
The sense of actually exploring new planets and discovering believable alien civ's is good.

A lot of effort and planning has clearly gone into making Andromeda and it's an easy game for me to recommend.

If Bioware keep improving each ME and DA title like this they will go from strength to strength.

I've played the game for a good bit and i do recommend it, it has a good story and characters and it runs well if you have a gaming system that can handle running it. however i would have to mention that it's not perfect as during the 40 house of game play (at the time of writing this) i have run into a few bugs in the later stages of the game. along with a case where when i ran my steam account of another device that caused the game to glitch out when i went to play it even when i didn't play it on the other device. but the only data that was lost was a bit of online data for multi player so if you only plan on playing the game for the story without using the multi player option too much, then you should be fine. But even then there are still some bugs, which in truth there are only one that i have found that makes the game to where that you can't play it (in short it just crashes your game but leaves any save data you have that was saved before the crash fine at least from what I've seen) from what i found was a glitch where i would to to access the email option thing you have in the game which would end in the game crashing but that's only a handful of times and as you wait until you've stopped by one of the plant/game locations off your ship then you'll be able to use the email terminal again no problem.

Even by itself, not being compared to its predecessors, the game is monotonous af and uber boring. The missions play out almost the same way, you go to a place, explore a bit, there's some very faked voice lines denoting how serious a situation is like some low budget TV show, then you explore the faked danger and resolve it with your buddies.

I tried to play this game again in 2023 after first playing through it during original release. 14 hours in...I'm already rather sick of fighting boring remnant, definitely disgusted from way too many forced ""humorous"" one-liners, and quite exhausted from such a dry ass story. The combat and gorgeous visuals just aren't enough. 

Whereas immediately playing terrible games like Fallout 76 feels like your leg snapping into pieces without warning complete with sharp, shooting pain...Andromeda rather lulls you into a false sense of security and starts out like a slow, barely noticeable headache. ""It's not really that bad,"" you lie to yourself. I hardly feel it."" But after 14 hours, that little harmless headache as progressed into a fucking migraine. 

Just don't play this shit. Go back and experience ME1-3. Forget this was ever made. 


The good: Combat and movement systems are the best they've ever been. The team responsible did a hell of a job. It's pure excitement to grab and throw enemies about with biotic powers. Planetary exploration feels fun and refreshing with some quite stunning visuals. Character creation has been vastly improved. We've been given a crafting system. Albeit the crafting UI is kind of a pain at first glance, it gives us more to do in regards to our loadouts. Leveling and skill builds are really fun, and feel rewarding/progressive. The story has a beginning, middle, and end (but mostly thank God that it does end). An absolute overwhelming amount of side content to do and experience (though a heavy amount of it is just run and fetch questing). Your first encounter with a remnant architect is intense and exciting.

The bad: Everything else? I mean. It's not an absolute tragedy by any means. But after experiencing the emotional stories and bonds from ME1-3 (except that series ending, oof), I'm not sure you'll really feel quite as connected here. All your new companions seem like the dollar store replacements of the original cast, and behave just the same. They also won't shut the fuck up with mundane stories and bickering while driving around the planets. Ryder's one-liners might actually be worse, though. Combat is fun, but the enemies are boring. The main antagonist is one of the most generic enemies in the game. Actually, the entire storyline is so basic and bare...you don't even really need to listen to over 75% of it, and you'll still understand. Some of the set pieces are impressive, but they're repeated too many times. At least several years later, most of the glitches and horrendous facial expressions have been fixed (shudder)...but still nowhere near masterpieces of say, the Witcher 3. You'll still laugh and be pissed at ""my face is tired."" And lastly, for being a brand new galaxy...the shit does feel absolutely the same as we found in the Milky Way.  

As an ME fan, you'll most likely play this game for the combat alone. Just don't pay $30. It goes on sale quite frequently for $10. It's worth that at least",1681797590,1682565943,False,2,0,0.516723036766052246,0,True,False,False

People here are unfair, Andromeda is by far better than ME1. ME 1 was a pioneer project A LOT OF gameplay problems, just the exploration part was tiring and mountain climbing.....forget it, hellish experience. ME2 was an improvment and possibly one of the best story wise. ME3 was an utter dissapoitment It became lifeless, crew conversation......well dead ship probably all in mind of indocrinated Shepard sorrounded by grunts.

Now let's start:
-Graphics 9/10
Graphicly Andromeda is beutiful and a big improvment from ME3 and at the time and even now should be considered as good.

-Physics 8/10
While limited compared to some games but if we compare it to ME series a major improvment especially from ME1 (The slow running and 5 second sprint kills me).

-Gameplay 8/10
Was it fun? Yes. There a repeatable things to do, yet you can interact with many things, i would compare it to ME2 interaction wise. I was engaged almost all the time, though i miss it when in ME3 i could get drunk and wake on coach with that Asari.  For the most part I could compare it to ME2.

-Story 7/10
 Story is probably the worst part of it, is it better than the main ME? No and sorta yes. The problem is, it is copy work for the most part. Besides the start we get the main enemy as collectors(almost like them), galaxy is in danger(once again whole galaxy is in danger),  Remnants aka Protheans v2. The outer layer changed but innards are the same.
 I would like to point out that it is more positive overall, ME series were more grimm and despite you achieving monumental things in ME 123, people pissed on you all the time.
 In Andromeda it is different, you start as a greenhorn, even your dialogue is quirky but as the story progresses people opinions changes, you change, your dialogue becomes more confident. In short protagonist is growing throughout the story which is interesting to see. In ME 123, you were the same Shepard and well You started as a confident Renegade/Paragon and you ended as one. The only thing for what changed in ME1 and ME2 a was a paragon through and through in ME3 I was pissed off at everyone already, constantly doubting me, constantly reseting my previous achievments so in some cases I started to act brutal but overall Shepard still the same Shepard, in Andromeda you are a quirky unconfident lad who was given great reposneability sudennly but you grow to become someone of respect and your dialogue also becomes more confident. 
 This installement had more humor even though.....on more juvenile side but still more humor compared to main ME series, basically speaking if in ME series, you could possibly interact with Wrex on more positive note with humor here you can use humor with everyone and it doesn't break your character or others.
 All in all Andromeda is an optimistic story while ME123 is a shit storm of depresseion the deeper you go. 

AS FOR THE ENDING, damn Andromeda has the ending we needed in ME3, You can actually see people you helped along the way MAKING a difference and helping you at the end, coming to your rescue and changing bad situations in to good ones. In ME3, you rallied whole galaxy...........But you saw nothing. Massiive fleets? No sight of them (almost), Allies on ground? Yeah....I had a good laugh. 
 In short Andromeda has ending we wanted in ME3

Overall

Give it a try stop romantising ME123, ME1 was cool but full of failed gameplay mechanics which were annoying and time consuming, ME2 best of the series was good I agree, better than andromeda? Maybe but only if we compare story AND THAT IS A BIG MAYBE as for ME3 rubbish bin like that cannot be compared to Andromeda it was better than ME1 but story wise well ME3 sucked. ME3 had the potential but showed you that no matter what you do nothing changes, Full war assets? Well good luck finding the difference between full war assets and just barely minimum. 
 
 Andromeda is an optimistic ME, ME 123 more serious. What ruined ME3 was it's ending and lack of normal closure, conversations were good but in the end eating 80% of fresh apple and then 20% rotten with worms will leave a bad taste in your mouth regardless if it was okay at the start. 

When Andromeda came out it was a bug infested garbage dump, but after 6 years I think it became a good continuation. I didn't play when it came out due to it's bad reviews. A lot of bugs, racist developers (against white) and etc...... But even if that all was true, now it is not. Though i would advice you to modd the game a little in order to cut down on anoying tasks like mining or transporting between planets and systems.

Major plot hurdles are resolved with the press of a single key, the narrative is simultaneously padded out and spread thin.

The EA Launcher is terrible, it sometimes wont start the game, sometimes it doesn't show the games library. 

Graphically it's a mixed bag, The building and ship interiors look great along with a couple of planet locations. But it's clear into which assets received development time. Most of the larger open world sections feel like a return to Mass Effect 1. They're empty, boring and difficult to traverse. Whilst being nothing particularly nice to look at. It also takes WAY too long to load even on an nvme 2.0..

Dialog options are meaningless, Ryder rarely says the choice you selected. Characters and Companions are mostly not noteworthy. I could go on endlessly but frankly it's not even worth the time doing so.

If you have an itch for Mass Effect, pick up the Legendary Edition instead. Steer clear of this game.

ps. I still don't know what the scourge was.

As the newest game in the series, it has received its fair share of criticism, but as someone who experienced it as their first Mass Effect game, it holds a unique place in my heart.

One of the game's strengths is its vast open-world environments, which are stunningly beautiful and provide players with plenty of opportunities for exploration. The game's combat mechanics are also top-notch, allowing players to engage in fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled battles.

However, the game's story has received mixed reviews, and some fans of the series have criticized it for not living up to the high standards set by the previous games. Additionally, the game's facial animations have been criticized for being awkward and distracting.

Despite these criticisms, Mass Effect Andromeda remains a solid game that is worth playing. As someone who experienced it as their first Mass Effect game, I appreciated the game's fresh take on the series and its emphasis on exploration and discovery.

Overall, I would give Mass Effect Andromeda an 8.5/10 rating.

Released in 2017, Mass Effect: Andromeda released to polarizing reviews, due to numerous technical issues, poor writing, and falling into the standard trope of open world video game design. So, did it ruin the franchise? Is it as bad as everyone says? No, not really. 

Set in the Andromeda galaxy (hence the title), the game takes place 634 years after the events of Mass Effect 3. You take on the role as Scott or Sarah Ryder as you try to colonize various worlds in Andromeda to make life habitable for the Milky Way races. 

Fundamentally, this is the best playing game of the franchise. You can jump, quick dodge, and switch Biotic profiles on the fly, making combat feel much more open and experimental than the previous games in the series. Firefights are fast paced, biotics are a blast to use, and gun-play is extremely satisfying and feels natural. Unfortunately, squad commands are dumbed down to telling your companions where to go, there's no more power wheel, so you're completely reliant on yourself in combat. The Nomad is the vehicle used to explore the open world planets, and it controls and traverses much better than Mako did. 

On the flip side of gameplay, there is a ton of backtracking. Quests will span multiple planets, and to get to these planets, you'll have to sit through multiple loading screens, which becomes very time consuming and tedious. Unfortunately, there are still plenty of bugs left unresolved even after the game was patched. These bugs did become a hindrance and grew more frustrating as the game wore on. The games exploring and questing suffers from a lot of empty space with simple fetch quests that weren't fun to do. 

The game spans across 5 main planets, your own ship called the Tempest, and the citadel-like Nexus. These planets range from frozen wastelands, to deserts, to beautiful jungles, and the sights of them are breathtaking at times. The Nexus is done very well, and it was fun to explore. The Tempest, while small, was still designed well, but it didn't have the same sense of identity that the Normandy had. Unfortunately, there are plenty of pop-in issues, shadow problems, and other glaring visual effects that weren't patched after the game's release. Face models, even after patches, still look abysmal by 2017 standards. Most character models of the same races look identical and most character models look extremely lethargic, which can be jarring. It's unfortunate and very noticeable within the game. 

As far as role-playing mechanics, the game stuggles in some regards. The renegade/paragon system is removed for more logical/lighthearted responses, that never really felt like much of the choices made mattered. Conversations felt like they were being funneled into the same path no matter what line of dialogue was selected. Companions can't die, which lowers the stakes compared to the original trilogy. While there are several important choices, it would've been nice to see more of them with the same weight as the previous games. 

In terms of class systems, players are no longer restricted to one class per playthrough. Instead, there are multiple profiles (Vanguard, Soldier, etc.) that can be switched during gameplay to suit whatever style of gameplay you'd like to play in the moment. There a multitude of skills to upgrade and specialize in, and there's a deeper crafting and development system than in previous games. 

Now in terms of writing, this is by far the weakest in the series. The game is poorly paced, and the main story is essentially a worse rehash of the first game. Dialogue can range from awful to very good, and it was unfortunate to be intrigued by a side story or the main quest, just to be pulled out of it by an extremely poor/executed line of dialogue or a plot thread that didn't make much sense. Most of the companions are well written, but none of them (except for maybe Jaal) hold a candle to any of the companions of the original games. While a lot of the side quests are the traditional go-here, do-that of generic open world games, there were a few that were well written that I considered very good. It's just unfortunate that when I did come across a quest that I genuinely enjoyed, there was always a feeling that there would be a 4-5 quest follow up of filler and backtracking. If the game had more quests handled with the care and emotion that the companion quests did, the writing would've been much better. 

Is Mass Effect: Andromeda as bad as everyone says? No, not at all. I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, the complaints that people have about it are 100% valid. When BioWare has a 20 year history of pushing out some of the best RPGs ever made, the question 'is it that bad?' should never be asked to begin with. Andromeda is a good sci-fi RPG that is fun to play, however, it doesn't live up to the standards set before it, and ultimately misses the high bar set by the Mass Effect franchise. It's a game built on good ideas, that were poorly executed at times. A game that BioWare hopefully learns from moving forward. If you like Mass Effect, Andromeda is a decent addition to the universe, but go in with low expectations to get the most of it.

So how on Earth could they take such a recipe and fail? ... Pacing.

While so much thought was put into how we wipe the enemy from existence, barely any was put into how those enemies are delivered. The story, while not original, is different enough to captivate an audience into wondering what comes next but slips and this is where the pacing issue enters effect. The developers got it into their head that we would like an MMO style Mass Effect and is reflected by both endless fetch/rinse & repeat missions and while not all MMO's have you backtracking through lots of mission spaces, Andromeda certainly does. This is simply the core of the problem, as extra's, you cannot skip the entry/exit scenes for your ship, nor is there a typical transit (fast travel) network for the main hub. You'd think that'd be the end of the negatives but they just keep coming: Bugs are still ever present, I have seen NPC's revert to their spread eagle development stance, floating around. I have also had a member of my team appear to be dead on the deck, sliding across the ground as they 'follow' me (The Grudge style), the game got stuck on two occasions attempting to interact with NPC's, enemy NPC's have repeatedly spawned in walls, on PC the cursor has got stuck in-game after leaving the pause menu.

Mass Effect [b]cannot[/b] work like this. It depends on steady pacing to move the story and character development along and its a damn shame that Andromeda went so far to stop the player in their tracks. The addition of bugs continued to hinder this already slow experience, leading to the ultimate frustration of me Alt+F4'ing the game and ending this experience. It's a nice reminder of why I could never finish it back on its release in 2017... On the flip side, it was cheap in the sale!

I came in with low expectations, but I was still hoping it was going to be worth my time. Boy was I wrong. I found the characters to be dull, the new setting to be uninteresting, and the main protagonist to be annoying. It completely abandoned what came before in order to set up this new universe only for the narrative to be so boring. After the masterpiece that is the original trilogy, this was a huge disappointment. No one cares about the new race, especially when fan favorite species are being sidelined. And the villains are just a snoozefest. After the Reapers, the Collectors, Cerberus, and Saren, all of which are FANTASTIC villains, the new ones, the Kett, seem EXTREMELY bad. Crap design, crap story, and little to no stakes. The gameplay was good. But i felt that completely abandoning the original gameplay wasn't the right move. I understand that the cover shooter genre is basically dead, but being one of the best of the genre, i was hoping at least Mass Effect (and maybe Gears?) would hold on to it instead of making a more generic third person shooter.

I played the first 3 ME games (without DLCs) as they were released (and as male Shep); then recently I played the Legendary Edition (this time as female Shep, incredibly better), which took me a little less than 200 hours. Finishing that, I got this right away, and I'm glad I did. This complements the original trilogy very well and doesn't conflict with whatever ending you chose. I'm not aware of the problems that happened by launch, but I had no issues playing this now. 

Also, in terms of gameplay, every title came with improvements. ""ME 2"" introduced ammunition limits; ""ME 3"" considered the weapons's weight, with a longer cooldown period for powers if you carried too much guns/mods; and ""ME A"" brings automatic cover (no need to push a button for it) and way more customization through the Profiles system (even the minigame is better, now it's a kind of sudoku puzzle; also, there's crafting, but I didn't spend time with it at all). Still, I think the combat is the least fun part of these games; what really matters is the story, the characters and the lore.  

It's understandable that people might miss the characters from the original trilogy, but the new ones not only aren't bad but they aren't knock-offs of the originals either. Actually, some of them are even more interesting; like Drack, an older, wiser krogan than Wrex, who unexpectedly has one of the most moving dialogues of the game; and Peebee, an asari who couldn't be more different from the cerebral Liara. It's interesting how family plays a way bigger part in the lives of these characters. 

Also, Ryder is a way more interesting character than Sheppard (who has a simpler background, former street kid turned military hero). Besides Ryder's richer family background, she's more of a scientist and an explorer than a soldier, and a way more inspiring figure because of that (despite the odds being really high here, there's more to the fight than just trying to avoid extinction). Also, the dialogue wheel now has 4 personality options, instead of Sheppard's simpler renegade/paragon/neutral stances. 

I miss the races not featured (there's a good reason quarians, geth, volus, hanar, elcor, rachni and drell are absent _ didn't miss batarians, vorcha and yagh, though), but the angara and the kett (who revealed themselves as an enemy as dangerous as the Reapers) are very interesting. 

""Andromeda"" is the largest of the 4 ME games released so far; it takes more than double the time to finish (without doing all the side quests and tasks, without hunt for achievements and without multiplayer). It definitely can overstay its welcome, because of some inevitable repetitiveness concerning quests and too much back and forth between planets. Another downside is that the open world maps are not that inviting to exploration; normally I don't make use of fast travel, but here it's a must (even if driving the Nomad isn't as nightmarish as the Mako). The upside is that the companion's banter is top notch. You can say all you want about this game, but it's definitely well written. And voice acting is pretty good, although with a less star-studded cast than the previous games _ the only actors I knew were Clancy Brown (Alec) and Natalie Dormer (Lexi). 

If you enjoyed the original trilogy, I recommend playing this one as well. I don't know if the next game will be linked to ""Andromeda"", but I do hope that the events of this game are considered. A full sequel wouldn't be bad, althought there's a lot to improve.",1681826696,1681844423,True,31,3,0.644208073616027832,0,True,False,False

The themes do not fit, the writing does not fit, and the conflicts that center around the human race do not fit.  Those are just the big things.  Sure, it has all the races but none of them have the character development along the lines of what was established in the previous 3 Mass Effect titles, so this game is a complete departure from most of that. 

The game itself is poorly written, the animations are incomplete and the stone faced characters delivering bland blathering dialogue focused on a kinder gentler universe is a complete departure from the irreverent snarkiness that was such entertainment in the previous 3 Mass Effect games.  Overall, the game feels like an incomplete game that was rushed out the door by a group of devs that seem to have decided they had enough. 

If you forget the fact that it is a Mass Effect game, then it is ""okay"" only. It is not a game that is near polished and complete enough considering the time and effort poured into it.  

There seems to have been a complete mismatch of goals with this game and the disconnect shows.

The game? Graphics are good, but that's about it, it's not a Mass Effect title - side missions don't matter, loyalty missions only matter for dialogue really, and some minor non-story-impacting reasons.
Research and Development of tools (e.g. weapons and armour) makes no sense. There's dialogue that makes no sense.
For example, [spoiler]someone dies, and the news broadcast mentions that their relatives in Milky Way will be contacted, even though we have just travelled for 600+ years at FTL speeds[/spoiler].

Andromeda has 1 major fault and about 10 other faults, the one major being - It is titled under Mass Effect franchise - absolutely undeserved if it was just Andromeda a game about space i would be much less critical about it but its trying to fill shoes it just doesnt handle
the 10 other faults are 
- SLOW AF movement between planets and systems
- unskipable and not interesting cutscenes
- characters are having a depth of a tea spoon
- ugly graphics on faces
- glitches
- the ryder looks dead in the screen and winks at me each time i finish a conversation for some reason
- Addison
- the romances are absolutely horribly made and the story is uninteresting as a whole
- the quests are tedious and not interesting like they were in previous games
- the map design looks pretty but generaly its either too large and empty or too high and annoying to climb through
also for some reason someone at the dev team thought it would be a good idea to connect about 30 quests in Kadera... because... i don know
I gave this game 1 play through i have 44 hours on it and 20 of those were just me moving from point to point
i tried so hard to at least go for the 100% completion but the game is so tedious i just cant bring myself to doing that,
Overal the game isnt bad, combat is satisfactory and challenging some humorous quotes are fine but completely miss becuase they are used in a crappy way, Krogans are fun as always and the use of your own powers is also fun
but i cant recomend it with clean mind so the ""Yes"" is only selected so i can warn players who liek RPGs to think not thrice before they get this even if it was for free",1681674024,1681674024,True,3,0,0.536854445934295654,0,True,False,False

Overall it's a really good game, but it's not a good Mass Effect game if you see where I'm coming from. It could've and probably should've been its own IP.

Gameplay is fantastic, even better than the gameplay of ME3 thanks to the possibilities that the jumpjet gives you on mobility. Vanguard profile with Charge, Nova, and either Pull/Throw/Concussive Shot is cracked. Just started NG+ on Insanity to do that all over again.

Characters are solid as well, sure there's no high points like Garrus, Tali, Liara, Mordin, EDI, or Miranda, but there's no boring characters like Jacob, Ashley/Kaidan, (or in my opinion) Zaeed or Samara. Every one of them has a good story, even the weakpoint in Liam is still pretty good overall. 

Story is alright, it honestly felt like I was playing a derivative of the Horizon series at times, but there were some interesting parts near the end which salvaged it. 

There are frame rate drops, some annoying glitches but nothing game breaking. Had to use Task Manager to quit a couple of times, but nothing to drastically alter my view.

You can easily read up on its troubled development cycle online about how Bioware wanted to make a No Man's Sky but gave up on the idea once they hired back one of the original Mass Effect writers how got the company moving on a game with only 18 months left in their 5 year cycle.

With that said, IMO what we got in 18  months was a buggy small unsatisfying game. Don't believe any reviews out there that say Bioware fixed all the bugs before dropping the game like a hot potato. I encountered spontaneous character teleportation where I was suddenly to the left and up a cliff when I was running straight. Dialogues don't always occur in vaults leading to soft locks where you have to restore a game outside the vault. The mouse cursor can appear in the center of cutscenes and become immovable. The facial animation for Scott were fixed, I think there were only 5 times his eyes rolled up into his head breaking immersion, but Sarah is still a hot mess smiling at everything no matter the emotional situation. I encountered many more bugs like making some quests on Voeld unfinishable.

The frostbite engine makes things look good don't get me wrong and named npcs look great. The rest of the npcs look like they were made of play-do. The prologue world got a lot of attention and looks great. Unfortunately after that you get nice looking on dimension rock world, ice world, desert world, asteroid which are barren and sparse leading to lots of boring driving around. The mineral scans return but now you have to drive around a zone scanning instead of probes from space. One exception is a jungle world that looks beautiful but the world is small and you can only explore on foot. 

Combat is can be fast or slow depending on your play style. There are more enemy types that will rush  you compared to the original trilogy but you have your jump jet that can move you quickly around the map. You get more freedom in picking any skills you want but you only get 3 skills at any one time and you can no longer order your companions to use powers or change weapons. The UI is more familiar to ME1 with all the sub menus except selling stuff is a pain since you have to go through all the sub-menus to sell items.

The story is largely forgettable and poorly paced. Most of the content is optional after a certain point so the main story gets put on hold for a long time while you finish up your checklist of quests. The story itself seems a remix of some of the previous ME trilogy and ultimately I felt the last mission was underwhelming and boring. Your choices primarily don't matter since there is no ME Andromeda 2... in fact there is only a set of three missions where your choices in these related missions determines if an npc you spend less then an hour with lives or dies.

I do like the Tempest is well designed and doesn't have real loading screens like the normandy. Most of the crew ranges from wanting the option to kick them off the team to passable. 

In summary I would recommend buying the game at 8.99 during the current sale, but with the need of the EA app which doesn't always start the game it is a hard sell even for 29.99.",1681054511,1681054511,False,17,0,0.595007717609405518,0,True,False,False

I desperately wanted to post a review along the lines of ""the haters were wrong, this game is pretty good"", but you can tell by the ""Not Recommended"" that I'm not doing that.

The only thing I can say this game gets right is the visuals, because the environments look fantastic. In every other aspect, it is subpar, both in ways that get talked about and in ways that don't. Yes, the facial animations can be kind of wonky, the dialogue can be incredibly weird at times, and everyone is trying too hard to be funny.

But the dialogue and story is just so [i]dull[/i]. The characters themselves are fine (at least in the time I dealt with them), but nobody says anything of interest, and the story constantly undercuts any moment of tension. Early game spoilers: [spoiler]your dad dying gets one conversation before everyone (including Ryder) stops caring about it, and the Remnant vault's death cloud eventually just gives up and fucks off when it looks like you're done for[/spoiler]. If it was all bad, at least you could get some laughs out of it, but it isn't. It's the writing equivalent of plain white bread, it's just bland.

That, I mostly expected. The gameplay I did not. One thing I see both fans and non-fans alike praising about this game is how good the gameplay is, and how it's supposed to be the best in the franchise, and I could not disagree more with that perspective. The game feels as if it doesn't know if it's supposed to be a cover shooter or a movement shooter: on the one hand, you have a jetpack and combat arenas are wide and open, on the other hand being out of cover is basically a death sentence and the game's a little too clunky for dodging from cover to cover to be viable. Playing it as a cover shooter feels like you're missing half the game, whilst playing it as a movement shooter feels like you're playing it wrong.

I don't know how people like this game, and I don't say that because I think they're wrong, or they're idiots, or whatever. I say that because I envy them. I want to know how they managed to walk into this experience and find joy, because I wanted to be one of those people. I adore the Mass Effect franchise and the fact that this review is a thumbs down saddens me.

I would best describe Andromeda as a mixture of Mass Effect 1, Mass Effect 3, and a cookie-cutter open world game, but I think it fails to properly mix these elements in ways that will pay off for most players.

---Exploration---
One of the most noticeable elements of Andromeda is its focus on exploration. I think the intent is to feel like an updated, realized vision of Mass Effect 1's world exploration mechanic: you get dropped off in your Nomad rover and fearlessly traverse the terrain of a planet.

Or at least, that appears to be the intent, until you realize that you're basically driving a Mako without a main cannon, still trying to painfully climb up cliffsides, visiting the same three kett bases or Remnant ruins over and over again, oh, and there are even more fetch quests this time around. Andromeda is not much of a step up from ME1's exploration, and without more interesting forms of traversal, the open world ends up feeling more like a slog most of the time.

As a quick side note, but lengthy landing/takeoff cutscenes and the long animations for traveling between planets grew increasingly annoying over time.

---Combat---
Andromeda's combat has also been a mixed bag for me as well. To start with the positives, the greatly increased mobility from being able to jump and dash adds a lot of dimension (literally) to combat; Vanguard is as fun as ever. Subtle details like blind firing out of cover with low accuracy vs. scoped fire out of cover with accuracy help bring combat to life. As a perpetual melee enthusiast, I'll also have to admit that variety of melee weapon options brings me great joy.

However, Andromeda trades depth for breadth in its combat. While Ryder's flexibility has improved, every other aspect of customization appears to have suffered for it. Namely, the fact that you can only equip three powers, and that you cannot manually control your squadmates' powers via the tactical screen like you could in the trilogy, means that in combat, your tactical options are far less diverse. This means only three active powers for core class mechanics, combo primers, combo detonators, heavy/power cell weapons, and utility. Although my squadmates have their own powers that can also serve in these roles, I have no control over them beyond ""hey attack this target for me."" At the end of the day, my squadmates feel like helper NPCs, not my teammates.

Compare this to a Soldier Shepard from ME2. Being a Soldier, most of Shepard's powers are just ammo powers (which are consumables in Andromeda), leaving you with Adrenaline Rush and Concussive Shot as your active powers. Except, that's not the case: you also get a bonus loyalty power, such as shield drain, bringing up your total to three. But wait, there's more: heavy weaponry basically functions the same way as a power-cell based power in Andromeda, bringing your total four. But wait, there's *even* more: you also have two teammates over whom you can have granular control. Even with just Jacob and Miranda at the start of the game, you now also have reliable access to Pull, Overload, and Warp. The most power-restricted class in ME2 still has more powers on hand in an average battle than Ryder ever does during Andromeda's gameplay.

---Writing---
The third major aspect is that the writing of Andromeda feels noticeably weaker than the original trilogy.

First, the main storyline involving the kett and Remnant feels fairly weak overall. As primary antagonists, the kett fail across the board as far as originality goes: they're essentially a repeat of the antagonists of ME2/ME3, but with poorer execution of the exact same story beats. They simultaneously fail to feel like a serious threat while also lacking in mystery, charm, or charisma. The Remnant and their creators are copies of the Protheans. I don't need fiction to be original (after all, virtually all stories are inspired by other stories), but this level of repetition is really phoning it in on the writers' end.

The character writing was okay, but often lacked bite and charisma compared to the original trilogy. I did appreciate the large number of ""Flirt"" dialogue options, which did help the development of relationships feel more natural.

Some of the best written characters were probably Ja'al, Drack, Tann, and Evfra, and I think it's because these characters have some bite and charisma. Ryder can have genuine conflicts with Ja'al and Drack depending on Ryder's decisions. Tann and Evfra are interesting foils to one another: Tann is an incompetent designated leader and focused on appearances and politicking, while Evfra is highly competent, no-nonsense, and genuinely charismatic natural leader, with both trying their hardest to keep their people moving forward.

There are a number of characters who have serviceable writing. Peebee clearly had a lot of effort poured into her romance, and her quirkiness, while not super appealing for me, was still well executed (although did we really need another asari adventurer-archaeologist?). Reyes and his Han Solo act, though grating for me as a lesbian due to how relentlessly he flirts with Ryder, is still generally well written. Though they very quickly ran out of dialogue, Kallo and Suvi had a lot of enjoyable banter.

Then... there's everyone else. I frankly preferred Kaidan and Jacob over Liam and Cora. Liam lacked the genuine chillness that Jacob/Kaidan/Garrus had going for them, and that's like half of Liam's character right there. Cora is like if someone mushed Kaidan and Ashley together and then surgically removed any personality that wasn't Alliance Officer. Sloane Kelly is Aria T'loak without the charisma. Let's not even get started on Nakmor Morda and the horrifyingly embarrassing, laughable fight scene she's in.

I think the best character to illustrate Andromeda's character writing issues is Vetra (and I romanced her!). Vetra is a sweet person who cares for her sister, Syd. She is very upfront about her love for her sister, to the point that one of her few dialogue options is asking about raising Syd. And unfortunately... that's just about it for her characterization. The edgiest thing about her is that Vetra is a smuggler, but this feels more like an informed trait rather than a lived one. Her character lacks *bite*, and bite is very important because it provides the kind of internal contrast that makes characters feel more complex and highlights all aspects of their traits.

For contrast, two characters from the trilogy, Garrus and Miranda, both love and care for their sisters, just like Vetra, but both Garrus and Miranda have other aspects that provide a deeper contrast. Miranda's normally cold, highly professional demeanor makes her gentle, melting concern for her sister all the more noticeable. Garrus' normally sarcastic, confident personality only highlights those moments when he lets his guard down and admits when he cares for people or that he's lost and confused.

---Conclusion---
Despite all of this negativity, I did enjoy Andromeda overall. However, I think a large part of that enjoyment was due to nostalgia.

Although Andromeda is a decent showing on its own, I opt not to recommend Mass Effect: Andromeda, because I don't think it offers anything that you wouldn't get elsewhere. If you want a Mass Effect experience and haven't played the original trilogy, I would much rather recommend you pick up Mass Effect: Legendary Edition over Andromeda for a deeper narrative experience that has yet to be matched in gaming.

Started off pretty well but after the first five hours everything falls apart. The environments look amazing but everything else is painful to look at, even with all the fixes. The combat gets boring real quick, especially on insanity difficulty, usually resorting to using the same three powers to do combos and then blasting at the bullet sponge enemies. Also, the AI is pretty braindead.

The story is boring and the side quests are probably the worst things ever created, usually involving you spending 5 minutes going to a planet, 10 minutes talking to a person, and then spending another 5 minutes going to another planet to talk to another person. Also, the ""loyalty"" missions for the companions don't even come close to those from the original trilogy but that could also be because I didn't care about any of the companions.

Overall, feels like a Chinese rip-off of the first game.

This is legitimately the best Mass Effect Game that has been released so far and here's why:

1. Animations are -great-. You say they're janky and bad? Compare it to animations of ME1 or ME2. Heck, ME3 has some horrible animation glitches such as weapons flying away from your hands. Here, the body movements look natural, combat and animation of gunfights in cutscenes look actually plausible. Sure, there happen glitches here and there but point me to a game that doesn't experience those when made on SUCH a demanding and hated by almost all developers graphical engine that's Frostbyte. That BioWare animators managed to pull off what we receive is nothing short of miracle. Facial animations are the only biggest letdown, I'll admit that freely, but most of them have been fixed since the horribleness of release launch. Still, Ryder's lazy eyes are legendary in how often it happens.

2. Storyline is absolutely fantastic. The first encounter with the main problem that the characters are facing is a classic and great way to open any writing- action, big trouble, potential cataclysm, no promise of survival. The game opens with basically that. It is engaging from the get go. The story leading is about as what you'd expect from all ME games, You divide the plot into several chapters that have some subplots which are optional to do, but expand on the story and what happens later in Ryder's struggles in Andromeda Galaxy. It's not bad and it's nothing new: Literally how all ME games operate. To verify it all you have to do is open any ME wiki and look through main missions chronology.

One of the biggest concerns over the game's plot, as far as I've read, was that it introduces another ancient civilisation of super highly advanced beings, as before we had the Protheans, now we have The Remnant. And that it's redoing everything again and it is boring. I disagree. We are learning about them as we go and we conduct what may be passed as first archeological examinations and discoveries of that species, as opposed to Protheans being mostly an already known deal. But we can't be certain about anything. It's an entire new galaxy with entirely new knowledge to obtain. It also makes sense that other galaxies, assuming they ever had space-faring life forms, would -also- potentially having had ancient civilisations that disappeared in mysterious circumstances.

3. Gameplay - nuff said. Literally the best of all ME games. The fluidity of it, combined with well known and some new skills for you to use on top of being able to switch and toy with your build across all three Engineer, Solider and Biotic skill trees just makes it the most interesting experience I've had. Weapons are made in reminiscence of ME1 and ME3 in that you get a weapon and you get two different ways to upgrade them: One upon crafting it with a weapon mod and one after crafting with an attachment. The same deal works with armours. You have a long list of weapons and armours that you first have to research, then get materials for and only then you can craft them. Simple and understandable way of obtaining better gear.

In terms of content for a pseudo-open world game, the exploration part can be fairly repetitive. You can compare it with exploration as you had it in Dragon Age: Inqusition, where you get on your mount, run around, get all the collectibles and fight monsters as you find them. You get basically the same thing in this game. Each map has a number of hidden chests and vaults that you can go to obtain and explore (you also get a helpful technology research that shows their locations on map so that you don't spend your entire lifetime on finding them) and everywhere you go, you find some outlaws, hostile aliens or animals that want to kill you or eat you for dinner. While exploring you may find side quests and even more unimportant ""tasks"" for completion, which serve mostly to showcase the reality of living on and the atmosphere of the particular planet you are exploring at the time. In a sense, it remains one of the most boring aspects of all BioWare games.

4. Characters - I've read a lot of comments about how they're bad, unlikeable and horribly designed. I admit, I went into the game sort-of blindly as I didn't want to get my opinion already colourised by others playing the game. I've only heard that it has a ""bad rep"" at the time I bought it. I can't stress hard enough how I disagree with every single comment that talks trash about the characters, their personality and their opinions about the Main Character. But let me try to shortly explain to you why I think they are amazing.

First of all, we have the general NPCs that fill the world of the game. You begin as pretty much nobody. Child of the Pathfinder of the Human Ark, but he already has his entire team made up. You're mostly an addition to that team. After all hell breaks loose at the beginning of the game, you get promoted to your father's rank- Pathfinder. A rank that is not hereditary. Something your father shouldn't have done whatsoever as it's against rules and regulations. But there we have it. Shortly speaking: People are -pissed-. From nobody you are promoted to the person that is meant to explore the galaxy and find habitable worlds for mankind to settle on and survive in the new galaxy. You become one of the few critically important people for the survival of your entire race- an absolute greenhorn and yellowbelly that wasn't trained for any of it. As a result, you are treated someone who hasn't proved they deserve the rank in any way.

Nobody treats you very seriously and at best they offer you the benefit of doubt. If not outright planning to forcibly replace you the moment you do something stupid. And it all makes sense- you are practically a nobody with cursory combat experience. You're not a soldier, you're not a military admiral, you haven't ever been to a real battle either. It is your father that was the war hero and scientific genius- shoes you can't hope to possibly fill in. That is the narrative of how all NPCs perceive you.

Now, coming with that narrative to your crew and companions. None of them treat you seriously. They don't know you, you don't know them, all they know is that you're the Pathfinder so they are forced by law and regulation to help you out. You have very few friends in the beginning and everyone borderline demands that you prove yourself not just as a fighter and a leader but as a -person worth believing in-. Cora shows it the best when she's openly supporting you, but the moment you and her are in private- she flips out with all of her thoughts and emotions at how you were promoted from zero to hero. Your own crew members come and go from crew meetings as they please, your authority is not respected, people work with you just to get the job done.

UNTILL. Until you live with them. Until you fight with them for several long missions. Until you do their personal quests. The longer you progress in the game the more each character on Tempest, your ship, opens up to you and begins to trust you. You have arguments, you have moments chilling with friends. You have moments of anger and fighting with each other. But in the end, as you try to do your best, you prove yourself as someone worth following. Believing in not just as a leader but a -family member-. That is the biggest difference from the past ME games, where Shephard is a renowned war veteran, special agent and glorious leader that's listened to without any questions asked. You're not Shephard and this isn't military. The game isn't about finding and hiring a team of expert combatants to join you on a special operation aiming to fight against an impossible threat. It's about learning to come together, like a family, and helping each other with the ultimate goal of finding a new, safe home. 

That's what your crew is. A family.

You don't play as the battle hardened, mission driven Shepard, but as Ryder you get to follow an equally important role, with different expectations. ME: Andromeda still has the campy feel of the ship, and the charming companions. Many will be tempted to compare them to the original trilogy's companions, but of course they will be less dynamic than then the ones we had 3 games to watch evolve and grow with us.
The actual gameplay of this is what really stands out to me. The combat and movement is definitely much better than the og trilogy. It seems like that is something that always improves in each iteration of Mass Effect. The inclusion of the jump jet and hovering introduces a verticality to the game that was missing from the original ones.
It's definitely worth picking up and experiencing, as long as you're not expecting it to be the replacement in that hole in your heart that the original trilogy left after completion.",1680080885,1680080885,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The short of it, if you enjoy wandering around and shooting, whilst chatting to various characters in the vein of the original Mass Effect, then you should definitely be playing this as it's very much a continuation of that, albeit in a new universe and character/storyline.The rover and mining places whilst traversing the planet is a good upgrade and refinement to the original trilogy, although so far at least, lacking any weaponry to point and shoot from the vehicle is a bit of a let-down, although there are upgrades to protect the tank and get it do things like send a shock charge when stopping to nearby enemies.The interplanetary travel is nicely animated, and scanning is not as tedious and time-consuming, which is good if you want to get into the action, not as convoluted as the previous attempts in the trilogy.The running around from place-to-place, dialogue and characters to unlock the storyline and quests are very much in-line with what you'd expect from Mass Effect, no big surprises there, although the karma system is gone. I can't tell how much the decisions affect the storyline but an accidental click can result in a branching of the story like your character becoming a closet homosexual for example, so be careful when clicking through if you're not that way inclined.I don't care much for the story or originality, just the gunplay and exploration, but the story is unfolding quite nicely as the game progresses. The combat is first-rate, and the exploring is also fun and one of the strongest aspects. The map and direction hud could have been done better as often it's very difficult to tell if you're heading in the right direction to your goal without switching to the map to check which direction you are facing. The range of weapon upgrades and powers is overwhelming and can be quite daunting, so read up on what each does to avoid a scattergun approach where you don't build up strength in particular abilities and weapons skills.I have encountered a few bugs whilst playing (about 25% through in terms of achievements) and they've not been game-breaking:1. If you do during an attack on a base, sometimes you will respawn and the enemies you are fighting will have been vanquished, so you don't have to battle again.2. Sometimes the final enemies disappear during a battle, though they are marked as red dots in the view, this prevents fast travel and activating the next sequence of a quest. The remedy is to simply walk away and abandon the battle area, then go back to the next quest marker.3. A few times I have been 'trapped' when falling or jumping and unable to escape, I had to reload.4.

So andromeda is a try to bring big openworld to the mass effect franchise... and its not a very good one. 
Travel between planets is just horendous, especially if you get some quest which has you jump several systems with little to do inbwtween. 
Economy is kinda broken int he game, money is straight up useless as there was not a single thing in a whole game (except for some quest items or one quest) i needed to buy. Research and crafting is kinda nice, but i crafted new set of gear three times during entire playtrough and once was just to get a shiny new gear before last quest and wanst needed at all. So looting is also pointless, rpg game where looting is boring... thats not good.
In combat you can use just 3 powers which removes a lot from combos you could pull off in previous games.
Story is... well actually quite short, if you would not bother with side quests this would be extremely short game. But its kinda decent even despite the fact that it is quite predictable.

ANYWAYS aside from EA being the absolute worst, Andromeda is a pretty fun game in itself.

In terms of storyline, it's relatively engaging (a shame Clancy Brown's V/A doesn't get much time here, IMO) and the game mechanics are a refreshing change from the original trilogy's.

On the downside, ME:A is riddled with bugs, a lot more than I would have liked from a nearly six-year-old game. This hindered me from fully enjoying the game as I would have liked. Similarly (though not the game's fault in of itself) nearly six years is enough time for graphics to look dated. A testament to the rapid pace of technology these days. Damn it all if I don't feel old.

No thumbs-down from me for ME:A, since it kept me entertained. But the lack of initiative in addressing these bugs from EA/BioWare leaves a lot to be desired.

First problem with the game is it was built very oddly cause it could have been called ME: Loading Screens. They constant and everywhere. And oddly they made many static with movies so you wait forever even when you could load them fast like I can. Some fans made a mod to shorten some of them but its just annoying that you have to go through like 8 to get from one planet to the next.

Sadly they removed many of the original Milky Way Galaxy species from this game. No Geth, Quarians, Elcor, Hanar, Drell, Volus, Batarians, or Vorcha. But no Worries you get 2 new enemy species, and 1 new friendly one to make up for the removal of so many races. Also the Angara look really weird, like their bodies. They look like out of proportioned stretch armstrong dolls. 

Enemy variety to me is very limited. You fight Kett, Angaran, and Milkly-way people that are indistinguishable from each other mechanically. Only the remnant are slightly different but still boring after a bit. They really could have worked on variety with how often you will be fighting things. 

The combat system is pretty much just like ME3, but with less control of you squad mates. I would have liked to play with more abilities but they limit this. They only let you bind 3 so you pick 3 and then just dump points into passives, and you will get a lot of points so it just feels like wasted opportunity. I played on insanity and mechanically had some frustrating bits. Not sure whey they would make a cover shooter but then have so many things that can shoot you through the environment. I don't think there is really any cool new innovations with combat, and I wish my character would snap better into cover.

The story has a problem with threat. You have alien enemy that are a serious threat, but everyone seems unconcerned and wants you to go find places to setup outposts. Dialogue is pretty boring, I skipped often in it because it was longer than needed and predictable. I didn't find my squad mates likable, except Drack. Most aren't awful just didn't care about the others. Also don't put Cora and Peebee together, when you're driving around in the vehicle they bicker like children and I mean like children. It was so aggravating I swapped one out cause I couldn't stand it.

Also multiple unexplained things in this game, clearly saved for a sequel, but it looks like that isn't going to happen because this one wasn't too well received. So be prepared to be left hanging on things.",1678966611,1678966611,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You play as the Pathfinder, a leader of explorers who must find a new home for humanity and its allies in the Andromeda galaxy. Along the way, you will encounter diverse alien races, ancient mysteries, and hostile enemies.

One of the best aspects of Mass Effect Andromeda is its story arc, which spans over 65 hours of gameplay. The story is engaging and immersive, with plenty of choices that affect the outcome of your missions and relationships. You will feel invested in your character’s journey and the fate of your crew. The story also explores themes such as colonization, identity, and cooperation.

However, some players may find the story too long and tedious at times. The game has many side quests and tasks that can distract you from the main plot and slow down your progress. Some of these quests are repetitive and boring, such as scanning planets or collecting resources. The game also has some technical issues and bugs that can affect your enjoyment.

Another highlight of Mass Effect Andromeda is its great vistas. The game features stunning graphics and environments that showcase the beauty and diversity of the Andromeda galaxy. You will explore lush jungles, icy planets, desert worlds, and more. Each planet has its own unique features and challenges that require you to adapt your strategy. The game also has dynamic weather effects that add realism and immersion.

However, some players may find the gameplay a bit repetitive and shallow after a while. The game has a lot of combat and exploration, but not much variety or depth in terms of mechanics or systems. The combat is fast-paced and fluid, but it can get chaotic and frustrating at times. The exploration is rewarding and fun, but it can get tedious and monotonous at times.

Finally, Mass Effect Andromeda has good characters that you will grow to love or hate. You can customize your character’s appearance, skills, and personality. You can also recruit up to six companions who have their own backgrounds, motivations, and opinions. You can interact with them through dialogue options, loyalty missions, romance scenes, and banter. The characters are well-written and voiced by talented actors who bring them to life.

However, some players may find the characters too bland or cliché at times. The game has a lot of dialogue and interactions, but not much impact or emotion in terms of consequences or outcomes. The dialogue is witty and humorous, but it can get cheesy or cringy at times. The interactions are friendly and romantic, but they can get awkward or buggy at times.

In conclusion,

Mass Effect Andromeda is a game worth playing if you enjoy action role-playing games with rich stories, beautiful graphics and memorable characters.
But it also has some flaws that may disappoint or frustrate some fans or newcomers of the series.",1678612642,1678612642,True,9,3,0.5151023268699646,5,True,False,False

Everything about it is just kinda janky and amateurish. Quests not triggering correctly, NPCs spouting dialogue that makes zero sense in the context of the choices I made, enemies getting stuck in terrain and walls, human type characters looking just super weird and animating similarly, auto saves breaking and not loading properly, mostly forgettable companion cast (aside from Jaal and Drack), the romance dialogue options making Ryder sound like a proper sex pest that should be reported to HR. I could go on... This game constantly has me eye-rolling. 

There are just so many things wrong with this game. Despite that, I enjoy the lower stakes story compared to the original trilogy. This is a story about finding a new home for the residents of the Milky Way. I find helping the different planets and creating conditions for eventual settlement with outposts quite compelling. The combat is also enjoyable with the combination of your party and your own skills.

Despite my complaints and eye rolling, I do still somewhat recommend this. If you're a fan of Mass Effect, its worth checking out as a companion piece. If you've never played a Mass Effect game, just get the remastered trilogy.

In 2023 there's still some bugs. Game breaking bugs too when you have to restart your game and immersion breaking bugs did occur.
The facial animations and animations of the characters in general are now ok... but there were some weird laugh out loud moments too which were not intended.
Story is just okay and didn't really make a lick of sense which is a shame. You're in a different galaxy so why not make tons more races and life forms other than organic or humanoids? 
Writing is pretty much garbage lol. I laughed a couple of times to some actually good moments but the main character is so bland while the side characters are actually more interesting.

Graphics look nice and the game ran pretty well apart from few stutters in the open world.
Worlds and planets looked sometimes really beautiful to be honest. Some character faces and textures looked amazing but some looked like they're made out of clay. I had graphics at ultra settings.
Music is pretty good too, really helped the atmosphere.

I played on normal difficulty and thought it was a perfect balance for difficulty and keeping me at least a little interested in the combat, which is otherwise just meh... Enemies take tons of bullets so I played mostly with a sniper rifle for 1 - 3 (some bigger enemies took around 6 - 7 sniper shots).
You can actually make a built character to focus on traditional guns or more sci-fi style abilities.

World maps are actually decent sized and they have a lot to explore in them if you care to sweep all of the areas. I did about 70% of the bigger side quests + the main story clocked in at 44 hours. I bet if you bothered to do pretty much everything and reading all the logs and exploring the open world maps 100% it would clock at around 60 - 65 hours for sure.

Choices didn't really feel like they had any impact to the game world. Dialogue choices didn't matter to the ending either so I was just an jackass to everyone and still got a happy ending.

Giving this a thumb up because some of you might really enjoy the older Mass Effect games and this is that but in a different way. It's a spin-off I guess. Anyone who likes to check mark tons of quest marks and explore big worlds will also enjoy this game just forget the main story.

The game is also absolutely LITTERED with side-quests that really make things feel like a chore just in the name of increasing play time.

But, if you can look past those things--and I think you should--this is actually a really charming title, too. It definitely gives you the feeling of exploring a new universe and trying to make inroads there. ...even if all of the aliens, even in a galaxy far, far away, all still look like humans wearing a latex mask. (SIGH.) The visuals are great, the combat is *mostly* fun, the voice-acting is definitely triple-A, and the overall plot is engaging.

On the whole, I actually really like ME:A. It's an experience. I crank the difficulty WAY down and just focus on exploring and ... enhancing that *experience* quality to the game.

Recommended.

...But not recommended if you are a completionist. It's just busy-work. You should go into this game feeling like it is PERFECTLY okay to skip all of SAM's ""I can find the location if you collect six more datapads!"" kind of tasks, of which there are maybe one hundred (seriously).

- Combat: the aspect i enjoyed the most, it remained fun throughout the entire playthrough.
- Story: nothing special but absorbing and fun nonetheless, lots of cool cinematics fairly often, also a fre nostalgia bombs from the original trilogy.
- AI for both enemies and crew members felt a bit off, sometimes the enenmies would be smart and try to flank you out of cover and sometimes they would remain stationary, waiting for you to kill them effortlessly, same applies to your team, they were either too agressive or literaly stay AFK if you were not diving into the enemies yourself.
- Music: it has very few tracks overall, they werent bad but i already forgot about them, it lacks music while on the open world.
- Character progression: leveling up was easy and rewarding, you can feel your charactger growing stronger little by little but never becoming overpowered, a small mistake and the enemies will punish you.There are enough skills and passives to help you define your playstyle.
- Replayability: Even though the ame is exceptionaly long, I would say you can complete two full playthroughs, using different skills and making different choices (played my first one as a sniper (combat+tech, and im about to start my second as a full biotics).
- Gear: Theres a specific armor for every playstyle which is cool. There is a shit ton of weapons of all kinds but in the end there are always a couple that are just way too good compared to the other, so even if there are lots of options, you end up using a few.
- Crew: Not enough and not very interesting, they lack variety (for combat).

The romance with Jaal was wholesome; Getting to form a relationship with his mother and actually learning about his past made the romance feel real!
The visuals were absolutely stunning but proved to be somewhat difficult to run on my 2060 which was disappointing.
The companions could've been better, romances aside. You learn about them but unless you romance them, it feels as though they really don't open up much even if your relationship is maxed out.

It is a downright shame the storyline will not be continued and we don't get to find out what happens next.

You people have some serious rose tinted goggles when you keep trying to compare it to the original mass effect, not the trilogy as a whole. People often complain about the story not being as good as the original but they are often talking about the entire trilogy in hindsight. ME1 wasn't any better than Andromeda when it comes to raw gameplay. I dare say Andromeda does it better. 

People seem to forget the utterly lame mako planet driving parts of ME1 that got super annoying after only a couple of planets. Andromeda has something similar but does it better in every way. The story line isn't going to be the same no matter how much you want Sheppard to come back. Honestly resurrecting Sheppard in ME2 was some lazy ass script writing. The story is basically the same in both where an ancient alien race built some fancy stuff, we find it and use it to explore, only to find out some OTHER alien race has a plan to wipe us all out. Sound familiar? 

I read about people hating the Angara race and the Kett, or maybe it was the lack of new species other than just the 2 general types of mobs you encounter in Andromeda. You either fought Kett or Milky Way based enemies (scavs, exiles, etc) and I get that could be boring to most, but you gotta remember this was only the first game in a likely planned triliogy. They had plenty of time to introduce new alien races and plot twists and all. 

Look, I liked the story. Were there plot holes? Sure. Are some parts of the game dumb and boring? Yes, but not as much as the original series. The Kett are still out there trying to wipe out all life in the galaxy, exactly the same as the reapers in the original. The Quarian ark was hinted at in the end which means all the original milky way species will eventually show up in Andromeda. I want to learn more about the remnant and I want to learn more about the Kett. The story is actually good and anyone that thinks it sucks doesn't know what a good story is. 

If you played the original series and haven't played Andromeda, I would recommend it. The ONLY problem I have with Andromeda is that the story will never be finished. There is a new ME game semi announced and while I know it won't be the continuation of Andromeda, I really hope it is. F the haters, this game is as good as the original and if enough of you ask for it, we could actually get a conclusion to the story.",1676995849,1676995849,True,29,4,0.593704462051391602,0,True,False,False

To put my gripe in perspective, imagine designing a game that revolves around storytelling, character development, and dialogue (and its based off a trilogy that is all those things) and all of it is terrible.
It's like a modern marvel movie where all the characters are just ""funny and quirky"" with no unique personality.

I haven't played in months and I haven't finished the story because I just couldn't find any motivation to play.  After playing the Mass Effect Legendary Edition and loving it so much I opted to wait until this game was on sale because I was expecting to be disappointed and I was right.  The combat just doesn't feel as good and fun as Mass Effect LE and the companions aren't very memorable and thus I don't really care about them.  One actually legit complaint I have is that the Tempest cutscenes are too damn long and should be skip able, its neat the first few times but with how much traveling you do, having to wait like 5-10 seconds for this animation you've seen dozens of times gets pretty annoying.  Also minor complaint, I don't like how the character models look especially the Asari, Idk they just look too different from the ones in Mass Effect LE and I hope that they go back to the old look for Mass Effect 4 or whatever they call it.  Like I said I haven't finished the story yet because I got so bored and stopped caring.  Unlike Mass Effect LE's story which was fantastic, Andromeda's story just doesn't seem very interesting by comparison.  Basically everything fun about Mass Effect LE is not present in Andromeda and it makes me worried about Mass Effect 4.  Honestly it feels like without all the established Mass Effect alien races like the Asari, Turian, Krogan, etc you would have no idea this was a Mass Effect game.  This game feels more like Star Trek role-playing Destiny(never played and have seen minimal gameplay) cosplaying Mass Effect.

I'm not a Sci-Fi genre fan in any media but I tried ME:LE when it was ""free"" on PS+. I got instantly hooked with the characters and the story(it ain't deep but it's something). I finished it in about 2 weeks. I've had my criticisms but overall, a solid series. Now, I understood the hype; so I said, sure I'll try ME:A. I've seen some reviews but majority are just the graphical bugs.. which doesn't really bother me that much.

Disclaimer: Despite having 55hrs. I still haven't finished the game. It's boring. Most of the time I'm AFK on my phone to take a break from the boringness. My guesstimate is I'm around 70% story completion until I just stopped and moved-on to another game.

The Good: 
-An ME on the modern graphics/engine(well, modern on 2017 at least)
-Combat

The Boring: 
-Story. It's not good, but it's not bad.
-The Protagonist. Man, I did not expect someone on the level of Commander Shepard, but at least give me something. Dude/ette is so soft and flat even the aggressive/mean options feels out of character when you choose it.
-Companions. If you think Jacob/Kaiden were boring.. hooo boy. Except Peebee and Drack, they're ok I guess.
-Planet/Exploration. Every explorable planet has a lot of repeated points of interests. That new '?' on your map? That's 1/X collectible. Between those POI's are huge expanses of nothingness like good old ME1. You can call it Nomad(Vehicle) Simulator 2017. 

The Bad:
-New Aliens. In a new galaxy you telling me we only meet 2(are Remnant included? then 3) new sentient alien species??? ME1 gave us at least 10 besides human.
-Side Missions.. or more like fetch quests. Gather me this, kill me that.. the usual open world stuff.

The God-Awful:
-EA Launcher.

I honestly remember having to wait 10 minutes trying to load a cassette game onto the ZX Spectrum, so exciting 'cos you never knew if it would load successfully or whether you would have to restart everything and wait another 10 minutes.

The actual game is a watered down ME clone which somehow manages to get everything that made the original trilogy great subtly wrong.

Some elements of the game could have used more polish such as weapon building UI, character interactions where some will face the other way or be talking from a distance, not enough checkpoints during lengthy missions, and having to make significant decisions (what to do with ancient AI) without sufficient information that left me feeling rushed. Also, sometimes consequences of missions were not felt like destroying Kett's shuttle control on Voeld which was supposed to stop their reinforcements but there was no noticeable difference before and after.

The game however overcomes minor issues and reveals imaginative universe and interesting races. You begin in very challenging circumstances where serious setbacks almost wiped out the entire operation and left the Initiative on the edge of disaster. Every mission feels as a stepping stone in establishing humanity in the unknown and unhospitable environment. There is a sense of mystery and exploration as well as peril as the story takes you into the future and the past. The game kept me thinking about it between sessions and I was compelled to continue as soon as time allowed. Environments are beautiful with unique planets each with its own challenges. Being able to reconfigure the character at any point in the game made it possible to change things up mid game and go from soldier to infiltrator to biotic and try different playstyles. Graphics are great even five years after the release. Driving around in upgraded Nomad was fun in itself.

Immersion is good with the map being the main and frequent interruption that could have been improved by having on screen navigation in the corner. It's very easy to get disoriented and be heading in the wrong direction so waypoints are a must. 

I would recommend playing on hard difficulty.

My main critiques of the game are that I didn't find the team members to be very interesting, the dialogue felt a bit cheesy, and the ending fell a bit flat for me.  Not that the ending was bad; it just wasn't very impactful and dragged on quite a bit.

If you're looking for the same level of horrifying and heartwrenching moments as the ME trilogy, then you're not going to have a great time. 

It's not perfect by any means, but I've never looked for a perfect game anymore than I've looked for a perfect movie, book, or song. All in all, the game feels current, it doesn't lack for story and characters, and it's a whole lot of fun to play. I fell in love with so many characters that I did not expect to fall in love with.  Heck, I started playing it as soon as I found out that your squadmates (FINALLY) make comments while you drive. 

There are still glitches that are annoying. For example, if you don't complete a quest that you can only complete within a certain window, it will stick around in your Journal (quest log). As another example, I had the game autosave on a jump over a bottomless pit. When I died, I reloaded on that save, fell into the pit, and revived in an entirely different area of the planet where the colors were half-inverted. The fix? Going back to a further save.

For lore and to kinda see how things go in no mass effect relay times yes. While the game brings in a way to make your Pathfinder (main character) how you see fit there are some things that need to still be worked out. 

Combat was fine and the rate of re spawn in locations is that of NES days. Moving away from an area you cleared out will be full of more people again. Great for leveling however for retreading an area just to scan something you missed can be taxing. I played on Normal and was just wanting the story and some combat. 

Difficulty spike with some enemies can be a joke the only times I died in combat either I did something stupid (like not checking my area or blinding running around to move things along for an ambush) or when the game throws elite tier monsters  at you with large waves and the NPC Party kinna goes off to do what they think is better for combat. I found that if you target a large Destroyer with turrets on it vs the left or right side of the turret and let them go at it while you trim everything else and or you clear the turret it works better.  

One Vault was awful with the introduction of it and my team would even after giving commands to go do something bounce back to me and not do what I was setting up.  Versus when in ME 1-3 I could play sniper and not worry as much about them not supporting me. 

The only other issues I have is even when you are well leveled for an area ( all members were maxed out for skill points to give them. Max friendship to unlock all final tiers.) and they were not taking nearly anything for damage they would complain the whole way. We cant take much more of this, is one i hate. Combat will have just started and I with four rounds in the Black Widow VII have either killed all the bigger ones or taken out a fair amount of grunts hear it go on and on. 

If you love Mas Effect as a whole and want to to play the game for a little lore and dont mind these things sure, otherwise get a play through to watch.",1675874582,1675874582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

💭 𝐌 𝐘 . 𝐓 𝐇 𝐎 𝐔 𝐆 𝐇 𝐓 𝐒 💭
Mass Effect: Andromeda is a highly anticipated action role-playing game, developed by BioWare and released in 2017. The game is set in a different galaxy from the original Mass Effect trilogy and follows the journey of the Andromeda Initiative, a group of humans and aliens seeking a new home. The game offers a mix of third-person shooting, exploration, and dialogue choices that impact the story, making it a well-rounded gaming experience. In this essay, I will delve into the game play style, character choices, and overall experience of Mass Effect: Andromeda.

The game play of Mass Effect: Andromeda is a blend of action and exploration, making it a fast-paced and thrilling experience. The combat system has been revamped, offering a more fluid and responsive feel, and the open-world structure gives players the freedom to explore and complete side missions at their leisure. The game's dialogue choices provide players with the ability to shape the story and the relationships they have with characters, making the player's experience unique to their choices.

[👍] One of the most important elements of Mass Effect: Andromeda is the character choice. Players control a character named Ryder, who serves as the human protagonist and Pathfinder for the Andromeda Initiative. Ryder is customizable, allowing players to choose their gender, appearance, and background, making the character truly their own. The game also features a twin sibling, either a brother or sister, who serves as the second-in-command and offers a different perspective on the events in the game.

In addition to Ryder, the game features a diverse cast of characters, both human and alien, who players can interact with and build relationships with. Some of these characters can become romance options, offering a deeper level of connection with them. However, the writing for many of these characters is criticized for being shallow and lacking depth, and some of the relationships can feel forced and unsatisfying. Despite these issues, the character cast still manages to offer some enjoyable moments and the player's choices have a significant impact on the outcome of the story and the relationships with the characters.

 💭conclusion💭
,Mass Effect: Andromeda is a solid entry in the series that offers a good mix of action and exploration, with the ability to shape the story and relationships through character choices. The graphics are impressive, with detailed character designs and breathtaking environments, but the animation issues, including awkward character movements and lip-syncing, detract from the overall experience. While the game may not live up to the high standards set by its predecessors, fans of the series may enjoy it, and the character choices make for a unique and memorable experience.

I played this years ago on console and was disappointed that it didn't have the same appeal as the original trilogy. 

I then picked it up again last year and I actually enjoyed my pkaythrough. While I didn't feel connected to the main character, the graphics are gorgeous and the side missions are fun enough. 

I didn't feel the storyline was fleshed out enough.

There are few things I disliked, like exploring planets feels like a chore sometimes, but overall experience is worth it.

Pros:
- ME vibe in the main quest, especially in the beginning and the end. I suddenly went back to 12-14 years back. It is not as intense as ME2 but the feeling is there. 
- combat
- scenery

Cons:
- a lot of repetetive filler quests which feel like a chore
- small stuff like faces of azari, no paragon/renegade options etc., but it did not bother me. The story itself is interesting.

Side note: I hope EA burns in hell for having us to log into EA account. I bought it on steam and after awhile it stopped launching because of this EA app. EA you suck.

Suggestions to get most of game:
- don't waste your time with filler quests, they are all the same. Just do the main quest and loyalty missions.
- don't waste your time exploring every inch of the map, it becomes boring quickly, no need to mine resources either.
- if you feel combat is becoming boring, increase difficulty. I started on normal and switched to hardcore.
- switch profiles. You don't have to stay with just ADEPT or INFILTRATOR, you can switch in any moment you want. I found out about that on my second playgtrough:(

Gameplay is fun though.

Edit after grinding through the campaign: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. I may be able to recoup the $5 I spent on this shit, but I will never recover the 40+ hours of my life spent suffering, hoping each and every time, that there would be some payoff at the end of the struggle. But the payoff never comes. It's ABSOLUTELY horrible. The characters NEVER develop. They're as one-dimensional as one could get. There is nothing in the side missions, nor the main storyline that grabs interest. The storyline does not even reach a climax - it's more like a bland plateau. There is so much filler that the main campaign is a filler itself. 
But that's not the worst thing. The worst thing is, this game quite frankly fucks the main trilogy.
Different races having different personalities based on their biology and lore (like Asari living 600 years being cautious and looking long term, or Salarians being much more intelligent)? No, not here. Everyone is cut from the same cloth of being straight out of Earth's High school. Lore and biology of aliens do not matter in Mass Effect Andromeda. And it also basically shits on the hard choices you had to make in the OT, and it goes ""well, see that difficult scenario from OT? It's no problem, easy solution"". The ethical hardship of AI in OT? How could you even ponder on the choices, this game explicitly shows one to be the the Definitively Best outcome, how foolish of you to even attempt at contemplating choosing something else in the OT.  It even fucks the ending of the original trillogy.  
And I won't even go on saying how terrible the facial animations are. I mean - they are pretty (as the whole game is pretty). But they're terrible. I bet if you had no audio and no subtitles you could not even tell apart a character that had just had their family slaughtered, from a character that is joyful because they had just achieved their lifelong dream. They both express the same emotion.

I love Mass Effect, the first game was addictive, the story exciting and characters interesting. Though each sequel had better gameplay and arguably more beautiful, the story had less of a punch each time. Right up to the disastrous Star Child ending. Andromeda was a promising reboot of the franchise and it failed utterly. Difficult to pinpoint one specific issue but more a perfect storm of bad design choices and management.

To start the writing is so cringe-worthy its almost embarrassing for any writer that penned it, the characters do not speak like actually people and plot holes are very large and quite apparent. Though the graphics are pretty enough standing next to similar modern games, the animations, body proportions and faces of human characters are poorly executed, on my system the faces look extremely sweaty for some reason. Lastly the gameplay, it feels much less smooth than ME3, the RPG elements especially crafting is a UI nightmare and collecting resources is simply tedious.

The whole game feels like a massive step backwards, as if it was written as a ME fan fiction and lacking enough development time to make interesting and fun gameplay, games above all else should be fun and Andromeda is extremely boring in almost every aspect.

This is a sci-fi RPG with space exploration that happens to have mass effect characters in it. A lot of the technical issues you've likely associated this game with like the wacky facial animation have largely been fixed. I say largely since I found that in the final mission of the game characters all of a sudden become much more expressive than they were in the rest of the game. It wasn't bad per se but it was just odd, especially after I'd seen the way characters talk throughout my ~70 hour play-through change all of a sudden. 

This game's combat is fantastic. The pick-one-and-go system from the trilogy is gone and now you can put points into any power category. Meaning, you can hot-swap between an Engineer with a turret, incinerate, and overload and transform into a biotic with all sorts of abilities. This system was a change from what I was used to but I liked it in the end. The story was not much to speak of, but I did like the aspect of settling planets in a new galaxy and running into all sorts of things. There is no need to 100% the game as you'll probably get sick of scanning things or driving around in the Nomad collecting minerals. 

The multiplayer of this game is meh. I have trouble finding games even being on eastern US. There are rewards you can get in the multiplayer that can carry over to singleplayer, but they're not anything crazy just some salvage or credits. It's just another way to play around in the combat sandbox, but the systems for gaining characters and loot are obviously meant to be grindy and annoying. If I had to guess, you're not looking at this game to play its multiplayer anyway.

Your AI companion that lives in your head won't shut up on certain planets, as in, he'll chime in whenever the temperature changes or there is a mining zone nearby. There are mods to fix these things but I was pulling hair trying to get the Frosty mod tool to work and it just wouldn't. Try modding at your own peril. Maybe you'll have more success than I did.

One important note: do not back-track to any planets to do side quests until you have finished the main story quest on Kadara. If you don't heed this warning you'll constantly be sent back to planets that you previously cleared from your quest log.

There are still some problems with the character models' eyeballs not working quite right, but I think it's much better than the disastrous 2017 launch. 

As for the rest of the game, the graphics in the environment are great, and all of the worlds you visit are really impressive. The gameplay/gunplay is better than the original trilogy, and the open world exploration is blended in really well with a linear storyline. You can definitely still get a little too distracted with meaningless side quests... But if you were ever going to take the time to do a fetch quest, make sure you stick it out for all the steps on Liam's movie night. 

The characters aren't quite as good overall as many of the ones from ME2 and ME3, but the voice actors all did an amazing job, the loyalty quests add a lot of good moments, and there's a lot of great banter throughout the game, even doing things that aren't the main quest line. 

The exploration and background of the main storyline is great. The bad guys are kinda... Flat. I guess. But I really enjoyed the political in-house bickering with your allies.

Although not a direct successor to Mass Effect 01-03, it can be classed as a spiritual successor. A number of critics and players have slammed this game, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Set in Andromeda rather than the Milky Way (there are various tie in's to the previous games, such as the Reapers and the Illusive Man), the game starts with you coming out of cryo and having to solve some issues on board your ark ship. You are then quickly released into the wider galaxy to meet familiar races, but unfamiliar planets. The main story involves interacting with three new races (either directly or through their technology and locations).

If you have played any of the previous Mass Effect games then this game will play in a similar fashion. Like Mass Effect 01-03, you recruit a team of people you meet along the way, including their (optional) 'loyalty' missions. There are also 'side' missions which can aid or hinder during the final main mission, and side missions for xp. The game includes planet hopping, character levelling, research, weapon/armour production, main/side mission item production, lots of conversations (with forced choice dilemmas on occasion), planet scanning with probes (for a variety of loot or quest progression), and getting various types of loot (for research and production).

First, if you're expecting a typical Mass Effect experience, this isn't it. It was made by an inexperienced development house outside of Bioware's typical team. The engine was improperly utilized and development itself was a mess. It will not feel like your typical Mass Effect game, especially if you just came off of playing through the Legendary Edition of the first three like I did.

That said, this game is actually pretty good if you come at it with an open mind. I'll go through a few major pros and cons to kindof give you an idea of what you're going to be stepping into. This might not make a lot of sense if you haven't played the first three games but avoiding comparison is impossible. The Mass Effect series is amazing and this step child is a flawed but decent attempt at earning its place in the series' legacy.

Pros (vs the main series)

Combat: Much more open ended and creative. You can link combos with different abilities and fire at enemies in a world that is much more open than the other titles. This feels funky at first, but as you move along the game's play style easily becomes second nature.

Exploration: There is a lot of it. Too much in some people's opinion. If you enjoy being in a Sci Fi universe and don't mind many of the side quests having limited if any impact on the main story...there is a ton here to do. I enjoyed the unique atmosphere for each planet and the ability to travel in a very open ended way. This is the least linear of the Mass Effect games, although you can certainly skip most content and just play through the main story if thats your thing.

General Gameplay: This is linked to combat and exploration. You now have a booster to aid with jumps, kindof like a limited jetpack. It makes exploring and planning attacks interesting and adds a little extra flavor to the typical Mass Effect (run, take cover, shoot) fighting style. It also makes the detailed environments more interesting to explore when the game takes advantage of it properly. I'm not sure I'd want this in the main series, but for a spin off it definitely has some fun appeal. 

Graphics: This is listed in both the good and bad. For the pros, the environments are anywhere from good to amazing. A lot of time was spent on indoor and outdoor environments and the extra work shows. For being a few years old now, the environments hold up.

Music: Engaging and cinematic. Nothing to really complain about here. Holds up with the rest of the series.

Multiplayer: Unexpectedly solid. Its essentially an added bonus to a game that doesn't really need it. They integrated rewards into the one player mode so you can take advantage of them there.

Cons:

Graphics: Here comes the other end of the graphics argument. Characters sometimes look like they were put together with playdo. Strange color pallets don't match the environment you're in and you can really tell the difference between a highly textured character and one that isn't. Bugs with body, eye, and head movement will sometimes have you wondering wtf is going on.

Writing: Most of your team is annoying to boring. Only one or two of the main cast are memorable compared to the epic cast of the main series. The banter while driving/exploring worlds is well done but anything relating to the main plot comes off as stale.

Story: Massive flaws in storytelling told through lifeless antagonists and villains. The main plot is pretty good but someone needs to rewrite this script and give these characters more depth. Huge missed opportunity here vs the main series but not as bad initial reviews of the game either.

Sidequests/payoff: Would be nice if some these effected the main plot some more. Most of your decisions matter little to the grand scheme of things.

No paragon/renegade system: Nope. Its gone. Replaced with the most boring chat circle I've ever seen from Bioware. Easily one of the most disappointing aspects of the game for me as I loved the different interactions and roles I could play in the main Mass Effect series.

Overall: 7 out 10 in a series that constantly ranks 9 or higher. I think this is the main cause of disappointment upon the games initial release. Despite being a decent game on its own, it doesn't hold up to the classics. If you can look past this, the game is a good time. Not great but definitely still good. There are some great mods out there that you can download that will polish up the games bugs and graphics plus add some quality of life functions that were desperately needed. At times this game felt bad and other times it felt great, it'll take you through a roller coaster ride of terrible moments and extremely intriguing high points. 

Go in expecting a fun ride that is entirely different from the rest of the series. Just don't expect this ride to be the same or great compared to the originals.",1674645028,1674961832,True,75,0,0.83289337158203125,0,True,False,False

That said, the game engine is terribly broken in a way that every graphic effect is glitching one way or another, and facial animations are laughably bad.

And or course EA closed the studio before any relevant post-release patching was possible, so there are a few obvious game-breaking situations you can easily escape via autosaves (which are multiple and frequent).

Other than that, performance is decent, gameplay is engaging (and most of the time quite satisfying),  and the story (including most NPCs) are quite interesting (even deep at many points).

Editing after finishing to say one extra thing: the story ends being actually good, and almost every NPC has enough dialog to add to that sense of wonder, exploration and discovery, which keeps growing until the end.

1. The biggest issue is super bad sound mixing, perhaps it was mixed for headphones or consoles where sound is delivered by bad TV speakers, who knows. But for PC game where you play it on mid range surround 5.1 it's just unbelievable. Bass way too high, surround unbalanced, front speaker way too high. Can't play it if my wife is at home. 

2. Storyline. Well, you are Christopher Columbus that went to the new galaxy all guns blazing, no pardon, no excuse, just war! First 15 minutes of the game you are on the brink, remaining 95% no quarter and no hostages.

3. Logic. You are driving a tank through a desert and bunch of scorpions attack your vehicle. First of all, would you as a a scorpion attack anything that is 300x as large and 3000x as heavy as you? Does it add anything to the game at all? Then suddenly in the middle of bloody desert there is dinosaur, because of course there is. And btw. does it change anything? Nope.

4. Random encounters. You can skip them by save and reload. It's one of those cases when developer implemented something and then didn't know how to use it and then didn't have time to fix it.

5. Pace. First you try run away from epic megastorm that will kill you instantly, next instance you are fighting with scorpions. Because why wouldn't you?

6. Mood shifts. Is this game about survival? Resistance? Learning new worlds? Learning new cultures? Forging new alliances? It cannot decide, one day you learning new language (damn I wish) second day you are fighting scorpions.

The only redeeming factor for this game would be: game director went forward and took responsibility for this crap.

It still has a knack for character development, species, environments and storytelling but at the same time they tried to squeeze it a little too hard.

The side quests are less interesting and repetitive, e.g. the big mechanical boss was cool the first time, but I don’t think repeating it on almost every planet was a great choice. Most of the side quests are also just fetch-quests, smell 30 roses, look at 40 rocks, etc., and a lot of them don’t even tell you where to find them. The open worlds maybe feel a little too open and empty too, the Nomad helps of course but still. Then there are the questionable UX changes, e.g. no quick-save, no saving during story missions, unskippable planet entry animations, quest markers that don’t become visible until you’re on the same height and an AI that keeps yelling at you that the temperature is dropping/rising.

But you get used to most of that, underneath all that is a pretty good Mass Effect game with all the quirks and unique characters you’d expect. And of course, a ship to make your rounds in after every mission just to milk everyone for dialog.

It has open world planets but they're not exactly full of life or things to do beyond enemy patrols, remnant puzzles, and fast travel points. 

The combat is actually good and in some cases better than the Original Trilogy (Legendary Edition), you have a jet pack in this one and can have different ""builds"" to switch between on-the-fly. 

The characters are hit-and-miss. I LOVED Vetra and Drack, liked Jaal, but didn't care for Cora or Liam. The alien crewmates carry the cast IMO. 

The story is not nearly as exciting or really even that great when compared to the Original 3 Mass Effect Games. The main antagonist is never really explained or touched on fully beyond the fact that they want to make everyone the same species as them, the remnant are unexplained, and dark matter ""Scourge"" is also not fully explained.  In comparison to Mass Effect 1,2, and 3 which had the Reapers as the overarching enemy across all 3 games. 

Granted, Andromeda is just one game and I'm comparing both it and it's cast against the story, gameplay, and characters of Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3, where they all fall flat or lie in the shadow of the original trilogy, with respect to gameplay.

If you can get it on sale it's a nice sci-fi game, there was a clear DLC hook and it's possible they wanted to do more with the story but the initial lukewarm response to the game basically killed it's future and left many of the games' questions to go unanswered.

Short answer: Yes.

Is this a good BioWare Game?

Short Answer: No.

Long Answer:
The game has highlights like exploration, being able to equip any skill you want from combat, biotics, and tech, and the combat, which is the best across the Mass Effect series to this date.  However, what makes this a bad BioWare game not counting the EA crunch and how this game got sidelined for Anthem, a now dead game, are the characters and story, BioWare's bread and butter when it comes to making games.

I can say that ME:A isn't as bad as it used to be. The gameplay itself is very much what I've come to expect from other Mass Effect games. Graphics are good, animation is tolerable, combat is fun, dialog is alright, and the story is okey.

I say the story is okey because I really feel like it captures the loneliness, fear, anxiety, uncertainty, and wonder of being thrown into another galaxy where we know very little about it. The story feels similar to the stargate universe, plus the events that unfold when you arrive add a sense of mystery to the overarching story.

I also like that the characters that become a part of your crew are mostly regular people with pretty normal backstories, and that doesn't mean they don't have character depth or development. On the contrary they have a large depth to them if you continue talking to them and you find out more about their personalities. It's also refreshing that these characters don't have some kind of ""special"" backstory that the old crew had that makes them exceptional people which is pretty nice.",1648320141,1674753403,True,1,0,0.508196711540222168,0,True,False,False

The game development was sabotaged by greedy, shortsighted EA management and thus it is half the game it should be. My review is not based on what my hopes for this game were, but what the game is now that it is 2023.

Game-play Combat:
This is a big step forward for ME, the combat is faster, more exciting and more nuanced then any ME game before. I had fun discovering what fighting styles worked best for which enemies and it is very satisfying watching enemies go flying after a well timed combo.

Game-play Outside Combat:
Slow... Remember running around the Citadel doing random fetch quests in the other ME games, times that by two.

Story: 
Underwhelming, which is forgivable to a degree for the first game in a series. If successfully built upon in a sequel it could be overlooked, but well, there is no sequel and I don't know if their ever will be.

Characters:
The main character is much like the story, see my comment above.

Companions: 
Half of them are kinda forgettable, the other half could rival you favorite companions in the earlier ME games (not Garrus of course). If the good companions got carried over to the sequel I would love to see where their stories go, but that may never happen.

Everything else:
Mediocre, the crafting, exploration, graphics, you name it. Most doesn't get in the way of what is good in this game but there it is.

Verdict:
There is a lot of fun to be had in this game despite so much of it being mediocre or just plan unfinished. Everywhere you see the unrealized potential of this game.

I started playing it back in 2017 shortly after release, but it didn't catch me that much, so I just moved on to something else. Dunno what brought me back to it, maybe the fact that I wanted to see the romance options. :P

Honestly, I'm not sure whether to give this game a thumbs up or thumbs down, and since there's no neutral option available, I'm going to split this up into pros and cons, but still give the game an overall thumbs up as I don't think it's utterly bad.

Stuff I perceived as negative: 
• Far too many side missions that send you from one system / planet to another. I wasn't able to finish few of these missions since it got too confusing for me. Not mentioning the loading screens you'll get from traveling around...
• You are not able to skip certain cutscenes, which is really annoying.
• The main enemies are quite bland, same applies to the final boss.
• The Tempest crew lacks personality especially the humans didn't convince me at all.
• Many aliens from the other ME titles are missing. It does have a reason tho if you follow the story, but still I missed them a lot.
• Enemy bases are pretty much the same and there isn't much variety in design.
• MASSIVE FPS drops / performance issues inside the Tempest which have never been fixed.

Stuff I perceived as positive:
• The combat system is really fun.
• A lot of people seem to kinda dislike the Mako in ME1 - not me, I loved these parts quite a lot. That is why I think that the Nomad is a nice addition to ME:A.
• The story is okay-ish I'd say. Nothing outstanding probably, but still enjoyable. 
• Co-op multiplayer component is fun - that said by a person who actually doesn't play that much multiplayer.
• Explorable planets. I think these main planets are well made. The maps / explorable areas are a bit small for my taste, but it's cool driving around with the Nomad.
• I LOVE the new alien species (Angara).

This game is nowhere even close to being as bad of a game as was made out when it was released. Its not perfect, by any means and has its flaws. These have been well documented and much has been made of them, so lets go through them:

The story is weak. This is true to an extent, feeling more like the set up to a larger story than a great story in its own right. This makes sense as that's exactly what it is, ME:A was intended as the first game in a new ME series, and looked at objectively, ME1 had this exact same problem. Without its sequels, the original games story is not actually that great. It is serviceable however, and certainly doesn't make the game unplayable. In fact i doubt much would have even been made of the quality of the story if it didn't bear the weight of expectation that came with carrying the Mass Effect name. Indeed, I've played, completed and enjoyed games with worse stories - Skyrim, FO4, all of the Fable games, and even, perhaps controversially, the first Mass Effect - All popular, beloved games that I thoroughly enjoyed which in my opinion had worse stories than ME:A. It's also worth mentioning that the story did manage to grip me enough that, when, at the end of the game, future content was hinted at, I was excited for it, and when that content was later cancelled, I was disappointed. If the story was as bad as it has been made out to be, it wouldn't have been able to elicit that kind of anticipation, opr subsequent disappointment that it wouldn't happen after all. Make of that what you will.

Poor/Unlikable characters. This isn't entirely accurate, but its easy to see where the complaint comes from for fans of the original trilogy. Its characters aren't as well developed as the orginal trilogies - but then of course they aren't, they got one games worth of development, not three. Again, none of the original games characters were that remarkable before they had time to develop. But they are likable, several of them are really quite interesting and if we'd had more time with them, could have grown into far more.

Janky visuals. This is absolutely true, though it only applies only to characters models, and specifically their faces, as the landscape visuals are absolutely stunning. Its also not as bad as it was on release, having been improved somewhat in patches, and really isn't that important in the grand scheme of things. If you can put up with the far worse visuals of older games, it wont kill your ability to enjoy this game.

And finally, something ME:A does well that many of those jumping on the hate bandwagon completely neglected to mention back when Andromeda came out - the actual gameplay. 
 In combat, ME:A is in a different league to any other entry in the series, being far more fun, engaging and dynamic. It is fast paced, verticality and mobility actually exist in a way that just isnt the case in any other Mass Effect game. In terms of progression, there are lots of different ways to build out your character giving far more options than existed in older games, and you can either focus on making your primary skillset as strong as it can be, or you can diversify into different sets of skills if you want and switch them on the fly, giving even more possibilities. You pick any of the passive skills you want to develop, can have any three active powers you want from a huge selection at any given time, and you can change these out easily. There is also a system called ""profiles"" which are fairly analogous to ME classes, can be swapped at will and the strength of each one will grow depending on which skills you develop. Its a very engaging system, and it makes it so that your Ryder is yours, likely using completely different combinations of abilities than someone else, and having different profiles that you have developed  and use, and this is fantastic in my view. And then theres the exploration, which was always going to be important given the setting and story. Fortunately, it is done very well, and exploring the planets in the Helios cluster is a great experience.

ME:A isnt a great game, and certainly has its flaws. But it is, despite the negativity it recieved, a good game, and could have been the beginning of another great series if it had the time to develop into one. It's a genuine shame that will never happen after the hate it got at launch. But even without the planned DLC and sequels, ME:A is enjoyable and worth playing - but probably not at full price, no 5 year old game is worth the full launch asking price.

- Remember I said the dialogue is not really bad? That's true, but forget about the ""role playing"" in this RPG. The player has no impact on the character he's playing. For example, the team has no respect of the main character, and there is no way to change that. I wish there was a gameplay option where the hero has larger balls. 
- The answers in the scenes make no difference, since there is no Renegade system that would matter. Just pick any of 2-4 choices with the exactly same outcome.
- Grinding. Kinda true. Weapon crafting requires a large amount of resources which you can't extract flexibly and are limited on the Galaxy map. The only extra way to get resources is from the crews which provide random resources from time to time.

The positives:
- Krogans are shown to have scientists and be more than pure barbarians.
- Vehicle exploration is nice. 

Neutral:
- Planet scanning is simplified so much it could as much be dropped. 
- I don't like the way object scanning is implemented. It only works while walking slowly and on a short range. It's a bad move to make players constantly stop and turn ""orange"" mode just to get +10 Science points. 

I think it's worth buying at discount. There is nothing that made me hate the game in 15 hours and the story+gameplay is mostly satisfactory.",1674468997,1674468997,True,4,0,0.544182300567626953,0,True,False,False

That all said, on to the game itself:
The facial animations are still really bad, as are the faces. 
The walking animations are also really bad, a genuine first timer could do better. 
Textures are subpar. 
Optimisation has been improved since launch but still isn't great. You can get into 4k30 territory with a 1070.
The gunplay is unchanged for the most part from mass effect 3.
Cover is finnicky; getting your character to crouch at the right moment can be a chore. 
The RPG elements are for the most part great; picking your squad and gear is as engaging as it always was. 
The worlds do feel kind of foreign at times but are still quite generic.
Dialogue is hilariously bad. ""my face is tired"" made me spit out some of my drink. This could be considered a good point, some levity is appreciated. 
The story is crap compared to the older games. 
The Kett are interesting in some ways but hilariously cliche considering they're in A DIFFERENT GALAXY. The protheans or rachni were more alien. 
Multiplayer is really good! 
There are some genuine mass effect 2 vibes at times. 
Footprints on the sand look AWESOME but are weirdly disabled near large objects, breaking the immersion they could genuinely add.
No SMAA, only TAA. This makes the game look blurry like all Frostbite titles. Very sad considering the beautiful vistas on display, generic though they may be. 
Weird texture pop in errors caused by conflicting texture layers and LOD. Debatably a bug with the game but I will blame frostbite, which is known for bugs like this. 
You can move at only 3 speeds: SLOW walk, jog & sprint. No analogue move controls. Odd for a console port. Seems like a small deal & can be ignored, but greatly breaks atmosphere seeing awkward constant shifting between too fast & too slow. 
Dialogue often fails to play audio, or multiple audio lines ay at once with a single subtitle line. This makes you miss dialogue. 
Female Ryder's voice actor is absolutely pathetic & hopeless. No emotion, boring delivery every line. 
The sheer prevalence of female characters in every damn role is off-putting. I play as a female Ryder and it REALLY makes the game feel sexist. Original trilogy did not have this problem. 
The game is prone to breaking its own saves through bugs that are unfixed due to publisher interference. (EA stopped devs from fixing these to save money)

It feels like everything wrong with this game is due to Frostbite, and being that Frostbite is such a dumpster fire that's not hard to understand. I pity the devs for this title, I really do - nobody should have to deal with DICE and their lazy garbage. If you've played the Battlefield series, you know what a pile of dog dirt that engine is.

To be continued...

Continued:

Playing this game for completion is a good time, I've thoroughly enjoyed it so far and am near the end of completionist playthrough #1. Will be doing NG+ because there is significantly more variety to the character builds you can make than in ME2&3. Story-wise, though, very limited choice is glaringly apparent.
Ironically, the gameplay is really good and contains a lot more choice than in the original trilogy. It really is your choice how to handle engagements, and the only way I would have improved upon the combat is offering ways to stealth around it rather than having to talk your way out of it.
The environments are, for the most part, great. Planets like Havarl are dull and boring, but Elaaden & Eos are fantastic and sprawling. Voeld looks very visually striking and is one of the few assets the Frostbite engine offers the game.
The ship landing & takeoff animations are about 4x as long as they should be and make travel more of a chore than it had to be.
There are a lot more empty systems than was reasonable to offer for exploration.

Update:
I just got nostalgic for this game. Unbelievable.",1614150607,1674447514,True,0,0,0.481927722692489624,0,True,False,False

Facial animation is not perfect, but still much improved from its release. Characters would be aware when other npcs were talking and move their head and eyes accordingly, pretty cool. Combat has much greater variety than previous titles. Combos are fun to pull off, but not as easy as I thought it would be. Maybe I just went a little heavy on the gunplay. Romance is still there which spices up the game and provides some replayability.

One thing that I really despised was having dialogue cut off too early. It would happen so often I just accepted not hearing full conversations. Anytime you; enter combat, discover something, scan something, deploy something, step into a different mission, whatever conversation your squad or SAM was having it would end abruptly. Which sucks because much of what makes this game special is the dialogue and banter between squadmates.

Another fatal flaw is the uniqueness of alien faces. Take any pair of Krogan, Solarian, Asari, Kett, Angara, etc and you'll find all of them look identical to each other. Sure they might have different colors or face paint, but their faces look the exact same. Which makes dialogue feel flat and forgettable. RPG games like this have a powerful opportunity to create memorable characters to compliment their amazing storytelling. Unfortunately if you put an oreo next to another oreo I'm not going to feel anything different toward one or the other. The antagonist was no different from the 3000 kett I killed. The same applies to the other alien races I interacted with. Which is a real shame.

The companions were boring, not really interesting. The quests were repetitive especially the side quests, those were just atrocious. Having to go back and forth, enter the ship, have cut scene play for leaving planet to find out the quest you were doing wants you to go back on the planet you just left. Had to do that SOO many times it was just annoying. I did complete most things and can tell you the pointless side quests aren't worth it. Also the ""major"" decisions didn't feel like they had any weight at all when you did choose one, there was no change in the main story line because of it or no replayablity for doing so in case you wanted to see what the other option was going to do. This game felt like it could have done better without being in the Mass Effect universe. 

There were some minor bugs, nothing game breaking. Near the end of one of the main story quests an enemy got stuck behind a force field and I had to reload the fight to move forward and that worked. Another was for a side quest on the Nexus about scanning boxes, couldn't find the last one no matter what but I didn't care so I left that one unfinished. Some of the cut scenes/conversations with my main character, her head would turn around like the Exorcist or she would have a funny look on her face that lasted for a second. Also whenever exiting the nomad, sometimes my companions would spawn far away and not with me for some reason. Also most of the enemies literally liked to spawn all on top of each other which was fine since that made it easier to kill them faster.

The game takes players on a thrilling journey as they explore the Andromeda galaxy and work to establish a new home for humanity. The story is engaging and immersive, with a strong focus on characters and the politics and challenges of the frontier. The combat system has been vastly improved, providing a more action-packed and dynamic gameplay experience. The romance options are well-developed and offer players a chance to form meaningful connections with their companions. The puzzles are challenging, adding an extra layer of depth to the gameplay. The planet travel visuals are breathtaking - though can get repetitive. The game also introduces new races which adds to the diversity of the story and characters. Overall, Mass Effect: Andromeda is a must-play for fans of the series and anyone looking for a thrilling and engaging sci-fi adventure.

Here are my gripes: 
 - The mystery is small.  The stakes are certainly not as grand as the first Mass Effect trilogy.
 - The planet travel is *beautiful*!  ...but it gets old when I'm traveling all around.
 - My biggest complaint about the entire game though is one that no one talks about - there are exactly two face models for ALL the Asari in the game.  There is no narrative in-game explanation.  This means that nearly every Asari that you speak with will have the same face model.  I'm no game dev but it feels pretty ridiculous for a game with a built-in face generator.

For me having no longer the tactical pause feels like a let down, and the cover system is ""wonky"". The costumization and research (collecting the research points) somehow makes it that you are locked down with experimenting with other weapons. So the cover,pause, costimization was perfect in ME3. for me and i hope they make it in future seem more like there.
The good thing is alot of the story is left in the cliff hangers (spoiler part; Benefactor, Jardin, Kett, Quarian ark) and i really hope we get a sequal for this one if ME4 turns good. The ground work for this series is there, so fingers crossed.

I love the main trilogy and this game, if you go into the game with no care about it holding up to the main series then its actually a fun game. During my play through I came to no glitches at all in cut scenes or in battles (it may be different for others.)

There are also some mods that can help your experience by increasing your movements, editing cut scenes or anything you have an issue with. If you do though be careful as some missions have a set path you have to take so your missions might glitch (It's what happened to me during the 1st Mission on Eos and I was unable to get Liam's Loyalty Mission)

For the people who like to romance in this game, I will admit there is only a few fleshed out love story from my view? (I havn't romanced many others except Jaal, Peebee and Vetra but I have watched the other Romances.) Some just feel like they were shoved in and you don't really get to do much with them or the romance just doesn't feel genuine like, ""BOOM! I JUST SPOKE TO YOU ONCE AND DID A MISSION FOR YOU NOW I LOVE YOU!"" I know many don't really find care about the romance but I felt like including this info.

Gameplay and story wise, the game is good! I will admit the story isn't much enticing as the main game but that might be just because It is one single game and isn't a story spread across three games or even dlc's. If you forget that though then its a solid story with a few little issues and sometimes it does get boring?

I'm baffled as to how anyone can claim this is better than the original trilogy. It has higher resolution textures but everything is is qualitatively and quantitatively worse. tl;dr The plot is stupid, requiring characters to be mega geniuses and absolute morons for the plot to happen. The game is super glitchy (google if you get stuck, it might be a glitch), and the graphics are really as bad as they say. And turn off HDR unless you want it to randomly look washed out.

First off, story was always the hallmark of the ME series. This is like a series of fanfic stories strung together by nonsensical plot points. Instead of diving into the more interesting aspects of the story, the game skips over those. And problems are conveniently solved through magical means whenever the plot needs to move forward. The writing is an utter incomprehensible mess. To illustrate, the first 20 minutes basically consist of ""You know all those limitations that existed in ME, yeah well they don't exist anymore because reasons"". At which point a massive super advanced ship happens to hit the equivalent of land. Wut????? Could you, I don't know steer around an unknown object??? Then you land on a a super dangerous planet (again for reasons) and everyone crashes. Better yet you get to a super advanced alien device nobody has seen before and within 30 seconds one of the characters is able to interface and control it. After this the ship has to go back and dock with its station. But there's no communications, its dark, and it hasn't been completed. So let's go in with caution right? Nope, we have a magical scanner and AI that can do anything but we'll just go in like nothings wrong. That worked out so well for Captain Kirk. 

The game is also super glitch. Being an ME game you obviously have to go around and complete tasks in order to advance the, um, let's say plot for lack of a better word. In several cases the game wouldn't recognize that conditions had been meet or objects would randomly disappear. It took me a while to catch on that unlike the original ME trilogy you didn't have to search for stuff, its right in front of you. If its missing the game is probably glitched and you have to restart or do other stuff. 

One of the most annoying aspects of the game is that the characters will not STFU and keep repeating themselves. I'm not sure if this is a story problem or a bug problem. The game doesn't seem to process the triggers for events correctly and you'll get repeated instructions. If you pass the same location more than once you'll repeated dialog, ""we should check that body for clues"". Um yeah, we already finished that mission. I don't need to be told yet again, that I can scan for minerals. I've already dropped 15 mining drones. This happens over and over in the game and gets annoying fast.

Lastly the graphics, you've already heard about this. They really are that bad. Facial animations are so mismatched. The earlier games were better at this. Things like hair and other details don't move naturally and have weird clipping. There's the weird background blurring the game does, but it ends up half covering screens and characters getting really annoying. And the freaking camera. I have no idea who thought it would be a good idea to move the camera directly behind Shepard so you can't see who you're talking to half the time.",1673934338,1673934338,False,0,0,0.450819671154022217,0,True,False,False

Like a early quest that seems pretty simple and fun....but weeks of game-play later the quest is still on hold and it has lost its luster.  Now it is an annoyance.  Like, what in the heck do I have to do to finish this stupid quest?

Quests that purposefully make you travel from one planet to another for seemingly no real reason other than to 'pad the time-clock.'  Like the game makers wanted the game to 'last longer' and so they have un-skippable loading screens and have TONS of quests that require you to travel from location to location to finish.  One part of one quest can have as many as 5 un-skippable loading screens.  ie - I just completed a part of a quest on planet A and it says I have to go to the Nexus.  1) Travel to the Nomad or the Tempest (loading screen if you Fast-travel). 2) Leave Planet A. 3) Go to the Galaxy Map and activate it (smallish loading). 4) back out of the planet and system you are in, find the other system and travel to it.  Very long loading screen.  5) find Planet B (this isn't always clear because of poor map icons, but that is another problem) click on the planet (quickly press Tab to partially skip a load screen. There is still the start of the sequence and the end that are not able to be skipped. 6) rotate the friging planet (seriously...wtf? I will be going to the same spot on that planet hundreds of times....why not make it so that the landing port is the default location under the mouse after the 1st time you go there?)  click the planet and watch another long loading screen. 7) Sprint as fast as you can to the tram, select your quest destination and you guessed it, another long loading screen.  Finally locate the quest marker for this part of the quest.... rinse and repeat for multiple parts of multiple quests.  Now you CAN try to keep quest locations together by doing ALL ava parts to quests at a single location before moving on to the next, but that will only get you so far.

Bugged Menu.  ALL OF IT.

Bugged Skill screen: Once you reach a high enough level to max out your companions skills, the ! icon will NEVER go away.  You see, you companions continue to gain skill points THAT CAN""T BE ALLOCATED, and the game like to remind you that YOU HAVE UN-ALLOCATED SKILLS!!!!!!!!!!!! So annoying!!!!!

Codex: Pretty easy to glitch it so that an entry will be marked as un-viewed.  Selecting the button ""mark all as viewed' will not un-mark it and neither will manually viewing it.

Quest Journal: Same as the codex bug, but way easier to get the glitch/bug.

By the time I finish a game with all codex entries viewed and all quests completed and viewed and all skills that can be allocated allocated, I will end up with 3 ! marks telling me I still have things to do in those menus.  But they will not go away.  The only way to fix the quest journal or the codex bugs is to start a new game or reload a save prior to the bug/glitch and try to figure out what caused the bug and try something different.  The skill screen one cannot be avoided at all.  Once you get to a high enough level, your companions will start having un-assigned skill points and you will get the annoying messages and ! saying you should allocate those points.

 ie Their is a Nomad Shield Bug where you can get schematics at least 2 times in the game.  If you get them and research it before getting ALL copies of the schematic, you will get a Journal Entry bug that says you need to research the Shield improvement, but since you already did, you will not be able to again.

New Game Plus? Nope.  DO NOT COUNT ON THIS WORKING!!!

Long explanation, so bear with me:

I started the game and played through most of it.  I finished most quests, but not every tiny little thing.  I got to level 70 something (can't remember the exact level).  I finished the main quest and most side quests.  Saved and then started a new game plus.

I did an even more in-depth game completion my second time around.  I got to level 103.  I maxed out 2 skill trees (Biotic and Tech) and had 91 out of 252 points in combat.  I had all research done.  I had maxed out gear for my playstyle.  I had 0 quests to finish.  My game completion (found when loading a saved game) was 98% with Heleus Cluster at 97%.  I don't know exactly what I missed to get 100%, but didn't really care.

I did not bother doing all the mining on the planets and so I had 3 different mining icons on some maps (Basic, Enhanced & Rich)  So maybe those were what counted, or perhaps I missed a few un-marked quests.  I did go back to each planet after game over to check to see if a quest marker appeared, none did.  So basically I had done just about everything that could be done.

I saved my game manually and the deleted all Auto-saved games in readiness for a 2nd New Game Plus with this character.  I wanted to get rid of all other saved games so that I only had one to choose from during the New Game Plus selection screen to ensure I was choosing the correct one.  I made sure no dialogs were on-going and no other message were happening.  I saved one more time.  I quit to main menu and went to New Game Plus and selected the only saved game file.

It 'looked' like it was going to work.  It went to the Character Gen screen and then froze for a few seconds and then CTD.  I restarted my pc, then tried again.  Same thing.  I loaded the game and traveled and messed around a bit, saved and then tried again.  CTD every time.  So I managed to get 2 playthrough's with a single New Game Plus, but could not do a 2nd New game plus.

Why would I want to?  Well, I only have 91 out of 252 Combat skill points.  In MA1 to MA3, you had to be at max level/points when you imported a game to get a 'boost' at the begining of the next game and to eve max out your level/skills in the next game.  ie I had to have max level in MA1 to get the best 'boost' for MA2 and so on.  So why wouldn't I assume that I would need the same thing for MAA2?  ie If MAA2 does come out, I assume that to get a good begining 'boost' I will need all skill points unlocked for all 3 skill trees.  That would be 252 x 3 = 756.  I 'think' that if you can play 3 times (finish the game 3 times gaining as much XP as possible each time) then you will be at or near 756.  You gain some skill points for finishing side quests and I do not know how many can be aquired that way.

An internet search showed that some people were unable to a New Game Plus at all, so I might be considered 'lucky' that I was able to do one at all.  There are 2 reasons I can think of as to why the New Game Plus doesn't work: 1) the point it breaks at (CTD) is where the game is checking its online servers to see if you have a saved game/character.  So, perhaps if you DO NOT backup anything to the game servers it will work (I have not tested that myself and would need for it to work at least 2 times for me to report it as a real possible fix, but I am not willing to put that much time into this game now).  2)  My first playthrough had bugs, and my 2nd playthrough had even more bugs, so perhaps the games own bugs are causing the New Game Plus to glitch/bug.  That seems like the most appropriate thing to blame it on since the EA, Bioware, Frostbite (game makers) don't seem to care enough to patch the game to fix it.

So in conclusion: Do not count on being able to do a New Game plus at all.  Manually save often and check your Journal and codex just as often.  If you get a bug/glitch, reload an earlier save and hope you can figure out the bug to prevent it.  Get used to very long loading screens very often in the game (even if you have a very nice PC).  Do not worry about a sequel, because at this point it has been 6 years and none have been announced.  So understand that the game is what it is and there is NO REAL CONCLUSION to the main storyline as you saw in MA1 to MA3.",1673839037,1673839037,False,3,0,0.521068751811981201,0,True,False,False

I started playing this soon after finishing ME collection, becouse i thought that this cant be that bad and oh boy.. The companions are really terrible and 3/4 acts like quirky teens and i cant even be mean to them or tell them to shut the fuck up like in previous games becouse being asshole is not even an option here (no Paragon/renegade). Companions AI is horrible, which makes them pretty much useless. Npcs might start running circles during dialog aswell. Game is bugged as hell. I tried to finish it but after about 20 hours i suddenly couldnt interact with anything and couldnt draw weapons. I tried to fix this but bug stayed and i only lost my entire exp and eq (thanks ea forums). I could load manual save from couple hours before but at this point i was done with the game. Combat is pretty much the same to original trilogy with addition of jetpack. I guess it might be cool but when the game have cover based combat floating around will get you melted pretty quickly on higher difficulty. They made the game more open worldy which naturally made it filled with filler content and weak side quest but its longer, so i guess its up to ones preference if its good or bad. I quite enjoy typical ubisoft games so i was fine with it, but beware that there will be many not engaging stories and flat side characters. Oh and the facial animations are still hilariously bad, no joke they looked better in original trilogy. I am gonna go play some bugsnax, its a game about colonization aswell but better.

Update after finishing this dog shit: Exploration is pain in the ass, both on foot and in the car. Terrain is usually rocky as hell or very steep, which make it quite frustrating to move anywhere (especially this fucking hills on desert planet). There are no uniqe enemies aswell. Final boss is just bunch of mobs and a recycled miniboss type enemy. Later in the game there are a lot more fetch quest in comparison to early game. After around half of the game i felt a drop in an already questionable quality. Quests were even more unmeaningfull and followed the scheme where you go there, kill some guys, click on console and you are done. Loyality quest were pretty mid aswell. They often felt like some very random isuess side chracters had and not some life changing events with a lot of build ups. The ending was unsatisfieng but i will admit that i stopped caring about this at that moment so maybe there is something intertesting if you start to read some additional stuff. Oh and the fact that main villain looks like a monkey covered in gravel that was hit in the face with iron doesnt help it at all.

I think with different name: Remnant story, universe of Mass Effect  will be much better and this game will have much better reviews from begining.
Game itself is quite good with good story, rpg elements and in game decision that affect story and future game.
Like many rpg games its some times get repetitive with side missons.
Graphicly game is good looking. I have only problem with human models. There are bland and not goodlooking as other species.
Overal its really good game

However, most of the ideas feel as though they were never really capitalised on, as well as the many glaring bugs, while graphics and animations have been updated and fixed, there are many that have not.

eg. 
-The auto save bug which corrupts some of your recent save files forcing you to re-load an earlier save, losing progress.

- Enemies clipping under the map forcing yet more re-loads in order to progress the game.

- The ""Hang Time"" Achievement is impossible on keyboard and mouse

The only real redeeming quality to the game is the combat system which feels amazing and the multiplayer strike team integration is done perfectly so as not to be necessary like ME3 used to be before legendary edition, but still rewarding enough to be enjoyable if you want to hop in every now and then.

This is all overshadowed by its many MANY problems even nearly 6 years later. 
i picked this up during a 75% off sale in a bundle with Dragon age: inquisition and I would honestly sooner pay full price for DA:I than buy them both in a bundle again.

this game is a low point for the mass effect franchise, hopefully Mass effect 4 can redeem it.

Combat is great. Only thing that I can say I thoroughly enjoyed about this. Jump jets and dashing/skill choices are wonderful. I'm probably in the minority but I would still prefer a class, though.

Obviously it is an unfinished game that will never be finished -the first in a planned trilogy that will never be completed, with unplanned DLC. But it does have an ending that is meaningful even if it is short.

It goes crazy on side quests and although the game guilts you into doing them for fear of dire consequences, most of the side quests have no meaningful impact on the story. 

The actual mechanics of the fighting, the abilities, the worlds are pretty cool. Some changes from the original trilogy were improvements, some were worse, but that's true of every ME game. Some of the characters were likeable, some were really bad.

Animations were fixed somewhat from launch but there's still a few horrible moments where your character is supposed to be looking kindly at someone and it looks like you're going to go at them with your teeth.

Now I have to say again, I played this before playing the Trilogy with Commander Shepard. Coming back to this review after playing them I do have to agree that Andromeda isn't as spectacular as the original trilogy, but that's not to say Andromeda isn't great, because it is.

I still definitely enjoyed exploring the Andromeda galaxy and fighting the baddies.
There's plenty to see and enjoy, as there is a vast amount of Galaxy & Planet exploration, fighting and questing you must do as a Pathfinder. 

The maps are large and varied, from space-travel in different clusters with Gas Giants, Asteroids, Space Anomalies and more, to planet-travel in Desert wastelands, Jungles, and Frozen landscapes.
Quests are fun, but usually send you on a wild goose chase sending you back and forth like a yo-yo.

Characters and dialogue can be funny, with several memorable moments.
Remnant puzzles are a royal pain in the rear end, kinda like playing Sudoku or another mind boggling brain exercise.
Choices feel like they actually have an impact down the line which is very important for any RPG.
Achievements, are a challenge, like a lot of games it requires patience and determination for a full 100%.

I've only had one bug with an infinite loading screen after completion of a mission, but other than that? No issues.
The game is definitely a blast and I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a bit of Sci-fi / RPG, as the game is a rewarding experience.",1626589130,1672930234,True,13,0,0.563582301139831543,0,True,False,False

this game. 
It’s a fresh new take on the Mass Effect universe. Yes it isn’t nearly as good as the original Mass Effect Trilogy when it comes to the story but it improves upon pretty much everything else. 
The combat is fantastic especially having the ability to freely move around using the environment and getting right on top of your enemies with the use of jet boosters. 
Exploration feels rewarding. The Nomad is very quick though I prefer the Mako as it had a cannon on top where the Nomad doesn’t.
The story is Ok but primitive compared to the Original Trilogy. Choices don’t really matter in the grand scale of things. Can’t go renegade or paragon in this Either.
Ryder is an ok protagonist but not written nearly as good as Shepard.

Okay at best characters, weak story, some cutscenes are laughably terrible, decent combat, gunplay feels good, good tools for creating your own build that fits your playstyle (doesn't follow the restrictive class system previous ME games had). It's a solid 6/10 game.

of fans hate it. But you cant compare them to each other.
Its basicly a totaly new type of game and just based on the Mass Effect Universe of the first three games.

The first 3 were very story based games where you basicly follow the epic and intense main story(and the follower storys) and beside from a few things thats it. But this game is an huge open world. Free to explore. A bit like Skyrim or Cyberpunk, only that you  have to switch between Planets and Solar Systems sometimes.

The main story is still good(but not that epic and sometimes a bit boring cause you have to repeat some things on every planet), but you can do a lot of other things in that game and that is what makes the game great.
-Explore the different Solar Systems with your ship
-coordinate response Teams for missions(or play them by yourself with other Players)
-Harvest Ressources in differnt ways, like Mining or through Command Center Perks
-Explore planets(in your super cool Nomad vehicle) 
-scan and collect data like in No Mans Sky
-Craft a lot of things, upgrade them
-go from enemy spawn to spawn and grind them
-build outposts
-try different builds
-do tons of sidequests/short storys
-farm reputation
and a lot more. Some of these thing you could do in 1-3 too but by far not so sophisticated.

Also the combat system is the best of all mass effect games.(Now you can respec everytime and try out all type of builds)

I bought it for around 5 bucs....and its absolutly worth it.

I feel the developers combined some of my favorite elements from Mass Effect 1 and 2 here, resulting in an even stronger game, but the somewhat loose connection to the story of the first two games might leave some feeling that this doesn't have the same emotional impact. The game also suffers from a bit of ""Fallout syndrome"" where endless and somewhat repetitive side questing is necessary to level up your character and unlock story elements that get you to your desired ending, even as those side quests do not appear to be related to the story at all (why Ryder, main hope of survival for the human race, is asked to run trivial fetch quests is beyond my comprehension).

That said, I found more than enough to like here to give MEA my recommendation, and I find it unfortunate that the poor reception this game has gotten most likely dashes any chances of a proper sequel.

And the forced EA app devalues the product because it made the saves more unreliable and gives no added value and forces a registration, in the end once you got it running it worked fine and despite a few scares no saved data was lost.  Also the bugs inside the interface where it shows stuff as unread or new when it's not, didn't really bother me much, nor did the inventory that could've used a bit better design. The main plot wasn't as catchy as in the original trilogy and some of the side quests felt a bit too seperate from the rest of the flow. But on the bright side in good sci-fi tradition after the slow beginning it does bring up unexpected points of views better than the original did and the few open world busy work world quests were just tasks you could ignore without any penalty or worry.

The actual gameplay of fighting, driving and exploring is flat out better and more fun than in the original trilogy. The start of the game (2-5 hours) is the low point of the game from pacing, plot delivery and gameplay point of view. Then it starts to get going and the later half of the 85+ hours was rather good. It felt like especially they put in a little bit more effort in to the side character interactions this time. Even if checking if they have new lines and then leaving immidiately when they didn't made the main characters interactions seem a bit psyhocit at times. And in this one I didn't run in to those jarring moments from the  original trilogy where you picked some response and got something completely opposite of what it should've been. So from a storytelling point of view while the big lines weren't as good as in the trilogy, much of everything else was better.

Mass Effect: Andromeda (MEA)... feels both cheap and janky...

MEA, just cannot really be compared to the previous entries of Mass Effect, taking into the considerations of both plot and gameplay... the overall... rework? Of the gameplay just sort of feels cheap, a limited selection of 3 active skills to use with some moderately long cooldowns, a floaty cover system, and jerky animations when running... makes it feel cheap.

The character models for humans, turians, and asari look... like clay models or plastic models, and features the classic bad hairstyles that BioWare usually has in their games, which doesn't improve the human design overall...

The only positive with the ~9 hour playtime I got in, was the story felt... sort of interesting, can't compliment much else, as the UI just generally feels like it's sticking things to the corners which is bad, except for the navigation compass which is great. Overall balance of combat at hard difficulty makes enemies feel like modern difficulty... slap higher health and damage making them feel like bullet sponges, and ignore any sort of mechanical difficulty, like improving enemy AI to surround you, or try to adapt to the player's playstyle to counter them... MEA is just a typical AAA game with no real depth to it.",1671709136,1671709136,False,4,0,0.415365844964981079,0,True,False,False

This game is what happens when you let pizza gate feminists run wild on a game and make decisions they have neither the knowledge or expertise to be making.  The default female characters are all as ugly as the nu-fem developer's feel inside of their soul.  I'm using over a dozen mods just to combat the synthetic uglification of the character models.

There are stupid cringe decisions such as Peebee hopping on one foot comically like Charlie Chaplin while trying to escape a toxic fog.  Can you imagine the meeting room with a bunch of blue and pink hairs taking a break from their twitter activism and saying 'Ohmygosh, wouldn't it be funny if while she were running for her life, she hopped on one foot and cracked a joke?'  Like... no.  It wouldn't.  It's not.

But wait, the comedic gold doesn't stop there.  ""I made that one really mad! .... Maybe it's because I shot him in the face!""  That's a real line.  This is the result of failed game journalists infiltrating dev teams and pushing out the likes of Cameron Harris (who was great) Chris Schlerf (also great) and David Gaider (great again) through office politics and backroom drama (looking at you, Manveer).

If you focus on the body movements and facial animations of the characters you can become disconnected or distracted from the game. Often times these don't necessarily line up with the voice actors tone and lines. There are a couple bugs. Make sure you save often. A couple of times I have had to save and quit due to a door not opening when it should or a item not appearing. The new dialogue system leaves much to be desired. I feel that my dialogue choices do not have a meaningful impact on the story and we are more or less forced to stay on a predetermined path. Some of the verbiage comes off as corny when the tone of the voice actors seem pretty serious. 

The gameplay mechanics are great and really make the game enjoyable. The characters power ups and abilities are really cool (best in the franchise) and the PvE multiplayer is fun because of this. Jumping/Vertically really add new dynamics to the game that were lacking in ME 1, 2, and 3. Driving around in the Nomad (mako/hammerhead replacement) feels amazing. It is much more enjoyable than driving around worlds on ME1. It may be a case of nostalgia for me... but the guns in ME3 are really missed in this game. There are several returning weapons but the overall variety that was added with later DLC packs from ME3 are missed.

ME:A has *awesome* movement and combat. That's why I recommend it.

The writing and character development is mediocre at best and vastly worse than its predecessors. That's why I do *not* recommend playing ME:A directly after finishing the ME trilogy.

Voice acting is good, but the lines are so lame. Dialogue has no weight like it did in the ME trilogy. Lines are wasted. Rather than developing personalities or lore, characters make inane comments and state the obvious. It's like the difference between listening to your coworker's friend's rambling 2hr podcast and experiencing a polished half-hour NPR podcast. I remember every little ME trilogy character, but can't recall any ME:A characters until I'm reminded. Oh, yeah, Peebee... Drakk... yeah, they were in the game. Right? Yeah.

But... the overall story's alright and the missions are consistently entertaining. If the trilogy didn't exist, ME:A would be a surprisingly impressive space opera RPG with great gameplay. Get it for the combat. The skill progression system is very free in this one- you can mix and match abilities as you please, rather than being stuck to one archetype. And the combo system is fun to make builds around. It's a sandbox power fantasy delivered in a vast alien world. I give it credit for that.

Maybe it's just my preferred playstyle, but after a final challenge, just play a movie and let me call it quits.   

Those complaints aside? I don't think cancelling the expansion needed to happen, they should've just patched, improved, and then dropped it years later.  Hell, Borderlands 2 proved it could work (they made it free, but the 2.5 hype for 3.0 was a great example of years-later content coming out). 

In the end though? This FELT enough like the original ME Trilogy that if you loved it or fall in love with it now that it's been remastered, definitely play through Andromeda after. 

I guess though it wasn't meant to be, this is now considered ME4.  Given that, and the trailer that dropped in 2020, I'm psyched for ME5 whenever it happens (just bring back the synth-heavy 80s-squarepusher soundtrack).

There's no real facial animations besides lip syncing, so any emotional dialogue falls completely flat. 

Combat is great, turns out if you put a shooter on the Battlefield engine the shooting is pretty fun. You can't pause or manually use or companions abilities (which I find absolutely confusing because powers can combo with eachother).

          For a fan of the original trilogy, [i]Mass Effect: Andromeda[/i] is beyond frustrating. Having written themselves into a corner with a controversial ending, the writing team of the third game left behind a significant challenge to their successors. Setting the events of the latest entry in the series in a galaxy millions of light years away was certainly a logical decision that allowed the new writers to entirely circumvent that challenge. Too bad, then, that much of [i]Andromeda’s[/i] narrative is devoid of that same logic.

          In their search for humanity’s new home, players will get to visit five planets (give or take), each with its own set of climate hazards and problems that require solving. These are essentially the five main, open-world levels spread out across the cluster and connected by the series’ new flagship - the Tempest. Each of these worlds, bar one, is so grand in scope, they require a vehicle for traversal. Enter the Nomad, [i]Andromeda’s[/i] version of a series’ old-timer. Lacking any weapons, like pretty much every vehicle or space vessel of the Initiative, the Nomad is an improvement over a physics-defying Mako even if it cannot overcome barely inclined terrain without switching to a different drive mode.  

          Most of the side content is pretty basic and fatigue-inducing. Pretty much all side quests, bar a few, are nothing more than glorified fetch quests spread out across the star cluster, often requiring multiple planet-hoping treks that, upon completion, reward players with completely unnecessary loot (junk) and experience points. Add to this the fact that they do not contribute to the main storyline at all and it’s safe to say that they were designed (a generous word) to function as simple game padding. This is perfectly in line with the gameplay design aspect of explorable planets which incorporates a formula popularised by Ubisoft. Each planet is littered with enemy encampments that necessitate exiting the Nomad to clear out just to earn some basic, ungratifying loot. The fact that after clearing a hundredth of these camps SAM, the protagonist’s resident AI, still feels the need to point out their existence to the player, interrupting interesting squad banter in the process, is a perplexing design choice. 

          Combat mechanics, on the other hand, are very good. Utilizing the new jump-jets to navigate the battlefield as well as the new cover system which has Ryder seamlessly transition to and from cover without getting glued to it is a genuinely fun experience. Sadly, the fun is diminished somewhat when, after spending several hours with the game, players realize they have witnessed everything the game has to offer in terms of enemy and level variety. Level progression offers another welcome addition by not restricting players’ choice of skills by their character’s class. Unlike in previous games, players can now invest experience points in whichever skill tree they desire, regardless of the class. 
 
          Squad members' combat behaviour and level progression have been downgraded. Whereas Shepard could use a tactical pause mechanic to issue commands and utilize their squad mates’ powers, the only input Ryder has on his squad’s combat behaviour is when it comes to their skill progression. For better or worse, outside the skills screen, squad members are fully controlled by the game's AI, which hasn't improved much since the last outing. Thankfully, the developers seemed to be fully aware of this, and thus all squad members have a significantly higher health and shield point count than Ryder, which means they rarely go down in a fight. 

          The narrative is where [i]Mass Effect: Andromeda[/i] falls apart. The writing is incoherent and convoluted, often contradicting established plot points. One example, in the sea of many, is meeting the new species called the Angara. Having stumbled on a world they thought uninhabited, Ryder and his team are surprised to discover an entire alien civilization has taken refuge on it. That is supposed to be the player’s first contact with another spacefaring alien species, underscoring the narrative’s focus on exploration and discovery. Any sense of wonder, curiosity or tension that stems from the inability to communicate with newly discovered aliens is momentarily dispersed upon exiting the ship and being greeted in a fluent English language. Later, players will learn in a casual, side-remark-kind-of-way, that this was not the first-contact scenario despite everyone treating it as such.   

          The conversations Ryder can have with his crew aboard the Tempest stand out among mediocre to downright abysmal writing that plagues the outside world. Be it through witty remarks shared with Tempest’s engineer Gil or a pensive conversation about religion with the ship’s science officer Suvi, this is where true role-playing takes place, allowing players to define their Ryder’s personality while simultaneously characterizing their crew. All this is helped by an improved dialogue wheel that’s unencumbered by an arbitrary, binary morality system and instead offers four types of responses corresponding to the emotional, logical, casual and professional demeanour. 

          While most technical issues have been patched in the period following the game’s release some problems persist. Character animations are stiff during cutscenes and, in Ryder's case, overdone outside of them. Just trying to run down any sloped terrain like the stairs, for example, turns into a circus performance as Ryder starts flailing his limbs maniacally above his head. Abysmal camera angles used for casual, non-cutscene, conversations with various NPCs have to be mentioned. Too often I found myself staring at the ceiling, or had the NPC Ryder was conversing with obscured in some other manner due to, presumably, automatic implementation of camera angles. Having to figure out the correct position to put Ryder in, relative to an NPC, to experience a normal conversation is a developer’s job, not the player’s. 

          It seems obvious that the developers tried to capture the success of the original game, which was released way back in 2007. Any similarity between the two titles, however, is purely superficial. The Nexus is a scaled-down version of the Citadel, its leadership an incompetent bunch that puts the Council to shame, and there is even a mysterious, ancient, alien civilization whose advanced technology is the centrepiece of the story. All of this completely misses the essence of the original [i]Mass Effect’s greatness[/i]. 

          With an open-world formula favouring repetition and quantity-over-quality design, a script which is, too often, nigh unintelligible, and surprisingly flexible, but somewhat limited, combat mechanics, [i]Mass Effect: Andromeda[/i] plays out like a third-person, action-adventure game sprinkled with RPG elements, which is, sadly, a far cry away from the intricate world-building and storytelling of the original it tries so desperately to imitate. 

 
          Positive: 

          - fluid and flexible combat system 
          - mostly engaging crew interactions 
          - beautiful visual art complemented by a fitting soundtrack 

 
          Negative: 

          - an incoherent narrative that clashes with the world-building of the original 
          - abysmal, often incomprehensible script 
          - repetitious and tedious open-world design with a strong accent on quantity without quality 
          - uninspired design of alien species 
          - plenty of choices that lack tangible consequences 
          - stiff animations and atrocious camera angles during NPC interactions

My biggest takeaway from this game is 'Why is this a Mass Effect game?' This game should be completely independent of the Mass Effect Universe. Having aliens like Asari, Krogan, Turians all come together in unity seems bizarre considering their departure would have preceded the events of Mass Effect 3 where aliens were far from united. Then the Krogan suddenly became immune to the Genophage overnight. Why set this game in the Mass Effect universe with such a rich backstory and history that is fully fleshed out and then just ignore huge aspects of it? This game would have been far better if it were a standalone game, where humanity had traveled to another galaxy alone and had nothing to do with Mass Effect. It makes discovering 'new' Aliens so boring because we've already met hundreds of other Aliens. The first encounter with the Angara felt like such a massive letdown.


Pros:
 - Combat is a big improvement over the original Mass Effect Trilogy.
 - Skill system is a big improvement. You're no longer hampered based on your class and can easily mix and match depending on what you fancy. Massive improvement to Biotic and Tech abilities, they feel really smooth and rewarding to use.
 - Visually it's great. 
 - Planets feel distinct.
 - Voice Acting is pretty good.

Cons:
 - Story is bland. It's trying to build on Mass Effects success, but let's face it, once you've saved the entire galaxy, piddling about on planets trying to raise their habitability is dull.
 - Too much sidetracking and time spent just going from X to Y (either by foot or by car). The Mass Effect trilogy was great because of how streamlined the game was. The story woven into the gameplay perfectly. Half of Andromeda is just running around from one point to the next and opening the map to set a new point. Even with fast travel being added in this game I still feel like the majority of my time is spent slogging around pointlessly.
 - Vault exploring is boring, if not outright annoying. 
 - Loot system. It feels like it's trying to go for a loot system similar to Borderlands but it ends up just being irritating. 100 capacity is not nearly enough and it's bothersome to try and sort through all the shit you've picked up trying to find what to sell and what not to sell. It's also annoying to have to retrack your steps every battle to pick up loot enemies dropped.
 - Scanning for minerals/plants/wildlife. I thought we learned in Mass Effect 1 that those kind of sidequests are boring.
 - This game is actively hampered by being a Mass Effect game. They've just constrained themselves to the laws of the old game and are having to write around their own self imposed obstacles. Let's face it, the only reason this game is a Mass Effect game is for the marketing.",1671041301,1671041449,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I just finished my first playthrough: the game was a lot of fun, I think most people who hated it were disappointed that it was so different from the original trilogy. Understandable, I guess: the first three games are pretty much legendary and disappointing the playerbase was terribly easy.

But to be honest, I think it's the game's strength. Andromeda is its own game, which takes place in another galaxy. It was a risk that sadly didn't pay off, but personally I am glad they went in that direction. After 3 long games of the same storyline, it was a breath of fresh air.

Of course, there's the matter of the infamous goofy/stiff faces, and well uh, yeah, they're there. Sometimes, they are pretty bad too. But most of the time, it's honestly fine. It didn't bother me nor did it take anything from my enjoyment while I was playing the game. Animations have never been Mass Effect's forte anyway, so whatever. 

If you liked the original trilogy and are curious about Andromeda, I say give it a try! The combat is really fun, the game ran really smoothly on my part, and while I had the occasional glitch here and there it was still quite rare and most importantly, nothing game breaking. The worlds you explore are gorgeous and very alien, it's refreshing and I enjoyed exploring it a lot.

After having a look at my last achievements, very few people seem to have completed the game (19% for the last achievement of the main quest at the time I'm typing this).

However, this is mainly because the game follows in very big footsteps.

Therefore, let me start with the advantages:
- Is game in space. And therefore the game creates a great atmosphere and great images. The space map is awesome!
- The spaceship ""Tempest"" has been beautifully redesigned and just invites you to explore.

Officially it is a Mass Effect game. But in my opinion it has nothing to do with Mass Effect (except that there are the known races):
- Uninteresting characters and especially dialogues. While Shepard says really interesting and appropriate things, most of the dialog here is irrelevant.
- Facial animations: This was already heavily criticized after the first trailers. It's gotten better, but still a disaster.
- Not very varied worlds. 

I got the ""worst"" ending, but it didn't feel that way to me. I only found out afterwards that there could have been better endings. While in Mass Effect 2 [spoiler] all crew members could die [/spoiler], it's nowhere near as profound here.

On Reddit, someone once wrote ""Mass Effect Andromeda is truly one of the games out there"". He's right. The game is nothing special at all. It can certainly please someone, but can't be compared to one of the best triologies and its predecessor at all, which makes it not really recommendable for me.

It has a few quality of life problems with the UI, but does a decent job with the writing and the sense of exploration (some QoL mod recommendations at the end of this review). With a minor mod tweak or two, the Nomad 6-wheeler is great fun to cruise around the planets, and the planets are diverse enough to each be interesting. The writing is quite good at the script level, though there are some sloppy-feeling or unoriginal conceptual elements that detract. There's nothing alien about the aliens or settings, any more than you'd find in the Milky Way. In a way I suppose there is an argument to be made that it makes sense, but even the armor, architecture and culture styles might as well be human. Combat is streamlined from other ME titles, and allows for choosing a playstyle that you enjoy. It's nice to be able to experiment with all the profiles/classes and powers with the same character, but ultimately you're going to want to just pick three combat powers to max out and run with. I wish this game didn't get so poo-pooed early on by people who wanted another Shepard entry, or who were upset about how ME3 ended. If support had continued and the developers fixed the UI/QoL issues, it could have been a great game.

I may be in minority, but I think that [b]Andromeda IS a good game and solid Mass Effect[/b]. Not as good as original trilogy, but it never had a chance to improve. Because of disastrous release, everyone (including BioWare and EA) abandoned the game and we never heard about continuation ever since. Shame, because there's some potential in the main story and in the new galaxy. 
Reviews won't help much. Andromeda is one of those games that you need to play and decide yourself if you actually like it. It's a weird mix of great exploration, middling story, solid companions and super enjoyable gameplay. Depending on what do you want the most, you'll like it (me) or hate it (metacritic and their 5.0 from fans).

[b]MAIN STORY[/b]
Three words - Call of Duty. There's so much stupidity, weird (and fast) pacing, explosions, doooopamine, saving the galaxy (again), more explosions. It's not a bad thing and ultimately the whole story is fine, but it can leave a bad taste afterwards.
It feels like a set-up for something larger. The problem is - we will never see the rest.

[b]SIDE QUESTS[/b]
Probably the worst part of the game. Half of the quests is embarrassingly bad. Boring ideas, shitty writing, idiotic choices with little to no consequences. Second half is just ""okay"". Few gemes here and there, but they were not able to save the rest.

[b]CHARACTERS[/b]
Personally, I liked most of the characters. At first, I thought that BioWare made yet another ""cool"" squad, that supposed to cater to younger audience, but it wasn't that bad. There are some cringe inducting dialogues + scenes, but they are rare and not super out of place.
Every member has hundreds and hundreds dialogue lines about quests and locations, banter with each other, small lore and backstory bits. Not even talking about banter on your ship, loyality quests or romances. Sheer numbers and quality is insane. Only other BioWare games are comparable.

[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]
Big improvements in many aspects, compared to older Mass Effects. Combat is insanely satisfying (you need to be blind if you don't see improvements over previous ME's), there's tons of weapons and armors + modifications so you can try different setups when you're bored, mining is no longer irritating, driving a vehicle is also less irritating. Probably more stuff that I forgot about. Of course not everything was ideal. 
Scanning for research points is tedious, enemies are dumb af, AVP system was half-assed, fucking ladders.

[b]VISUALS AND AUDIO[/b]
Graphically, it's not bad. A lot of models looks dated, but level designers tried their damnedest to smash everything together into something nice. They managed to do it. Locations are pretty and some designs (especially vaults) are amazing. 
Sadly, I can't say the same about characters. Most of them is atrocious, especially when you combine them with comically bad animations.
At least they didn't screw up audio and music. That's good, I guess? 

[b]BUGS[/b]
There's A LOT of bugs and glitches in Andromeda. Usually, they are just small things like shaking characters, broken running animations, some quests didn't trigger, chests buried under ground, etc. These things are not game breaking, but they may be annoying after several hours. Especially when your mouse will stop responding in the menus and you can't save your game before restart...
Yet another annoyance - some dialogue triggers are stupidly placed. Characters will start and stop talking at random times just because you reached new trigger. 

[b]PERFORMANCE[/b]
It wasn't as bad as I initially thought. First planet that you'll visit is horrible, with constant FPS drops. Luckily, everything else is really well optimized. Sure, could be better at times (FPS can dip in certain situations and places), but it was enough to comfortably play the game.

Andromeda also failed to make any improvements to combat. So it fails as a FPS.

I don't understand the hate towards it. Mostly because there are new characters involved is my primary guess. But tbh, this game is not bad at all. Sure there are a few glitches that require load game resets. I'm also not justifying why people won't like it, I can see it won't be the same thrill ride, and it's a bit grindy too, but apart from that, the environments and the world building is spectacular. Meeting new civilisations and figuring out new challenges that none of the milky way species have faced, it's very fun to be completely honest.
I recommend this game for people who enjoy mystery of the unknown. It does offer new things compared to the originals and yes it has a few flaws, but I really don't see it bogging down the story. They tried to make it more of an rpg by focusing heavily on gathering materials and crafting things. And tbh it gets a bit tedious, but in the long run, crafting a better weapon does help taking out enemies faster is what I noticed. So it's not just a gimmick. 
I played this game twice, first time I got halfway through and due to personal reasons, I had to stop. Later when I picked it up again, I actually completed the whole story including all crew and planetary side missions. So there is atleast 70+ hours worth of quests that actually help flesh out the new crew of the tempest. 

[h1]rating part:[/h1]

[b]Story: 7.5/10[/b]
It was quite good. Not as spectacular, but definitely noteworthy from a writing point of view. Plus the links to the original trilogy makes it a lot more special... 

[b]Graphics: 9/10[/b]
in all honesty, pretty good. With a good HDR monitor the colors and textures pop and the other wordly feeling of some planets is spectacular... 

[b]Gameplay: 8/10[/b]
Now here is where the changes are massive from previous installments. The jumpjets and dodge mechanics are a good addition. Plus it adds a ton of depth to fighting which were not in the originals. I would have preferred more enemy types. It's rather convenient to use the same wildlife on every planet because of the lore, but it's just tedious. Atleast from a scientific point of view, they should have modded the character models and made them more unique with new evolutionary traits with different buffs and weaknesses. Free roaming with larger maps is one thing I loved, the scale of some maps was impressive and how fast they loaded was nothing short of amazing given how some maps are pretty damn huge. Also adding the 6 wheeler nomad back is a huge plus. One last thing, the amount of powers and the ability to choose your class type was broader, but switching mid fights was something of a cop out, it just made the gameplay a bit too easy if you switch from all biotic to a mix of tech and combat styles. They should have limited the switchability is all. But apart from that, the powers were great to use and combos were satisfying once upgraded to max.

It was decent, not the worst, not the best. Good synth and electronic music and sfx. Mass effect classic

[b]Audience: Adults/teens[/b]
Catered for the mass effect fans, who are probably older now, plus it targets moral dilemmas and choices like the original did, so nothing short of making choices makes the person type of deal.

[b]PC requirements: decent[/b]
Would prefer a decent rig, post 2016 processors and graphic cards to get medium to high performance. I have 30 series card and gen 3 amd processor so it was a walk in the park for my rig

[b]Difficulty: A bit of a challenge[/b]
I played my second playthrough on the hardest possible difficulty, it was a bit of a challenge tbh. Especially when you are a low level. You lose shields and health with 2 or 3 hits. So not souls like, but witcher like death wish setting.

[b]Grind: yeah, that's the trouble[/b]
It's a bit too grindy at times, especially certain missions when you have to constantly hop from planet to planet, it gets a bit annoying. At that grind mostly exists for tasks and side missions.

[b]Game time: quite long but depends[/b]
If you choose to just play the story only, it should be less than like 15 hours, but building character relationships will take the most time. Getting to know your crew is the fun part tbh, adds roughly 50 hours more. 

[b]Bugs: oof indeed[/b]
I'm surprised there are a few game breaking bugs that haven't been fixed, at it kinda sucks. Especially enemies just fall of the map and you can't finish the quest because you are supposed to kill them. Then you have to reset to a save file and redo everything, it's tedious to say the least.

[b]Price: it's okay[/b]
I won't say it justifies the 20+ dollar purchase price, but on sale, worth buying. I got it for 7 bucks on a sale a few years ago, for that price, it's a hell of a lot of game.

[h1]Overall rating: 8/10[/h1]
Nothing exceptional, but as a fan of the franchise, it offers a lot more than meets the eye. Great story, good lore and connections to the previous games. Actually decent character arcs and build types. Worth a buy for new and old fans alike.",1669664878,1669664878,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game isn't as good as Mass Effect one or two. It's just not. This game's biggest trial is being compared to the amazing Mass Effect original trilogy which even today stands as a titan of storytelling in video games. The characters, the world, all of it was wonderful and that can't be spoken about enough. But this game?

It's still good. I'd argue it's better than most non-bioware sci fi games out there. There are foibles, there are some rather stiff dialogue at moments but the character moments, the universe, the lore? It's all good. This is a wonderful schlocky popcorn movie-esque story set in the mass effect universe. Not nearly as deep, but still interesting in its own right.

Now for the controversial bit of this review. The combat in Andromeda is better than any of the Mass Effect Trilogy. This is partly due to it having five years to cook because it was the first thing built and never scrapped, and partly due to frostbite being a damn good engine for shooting things. The jump jets, the guns, the biotic or techy powers, it's all so good. Biotic charging in, landing that meaty shot gun hit, jump jetting up out of the line of fire and doing it again to something all over again makes you feel like a badass. There are so many ways to play and this game does combat so well.",1669515656,1669515656,True,48,0,0.788956642150878906,0,True,False,False

While it is not a perfect game it is still a good game. Getting down to  the good and the bad;

THE BAD
- Though facial animations are fix from the initial launch, the Frostbite engine makes for some less expressive wooden Character expressions. Sadness and Joy from characters is kinda odd at times. 

-Asari are kinda homely now, gone are the sexy often femme fatale of the original trilogy. With the exception of Pebee and maybe Lexi they all look very similar. Maybe an engine issue or time related issue.

- Some environmental bugs still exists. Sometimes attacks will cause enemies to clip and get stuck in terrain, while this isn't an issue most of the time I did have it happen during a quest requiring all enemies to be killed.

The Good
- Combat is the star of the show. It feels like they combined a little from Dragon Age Inquisition, the best ideas from ME Trilogy and added some new flare. Combat primers and detonators are fun to setup. I especially loved the Biotic Echos perk chaining on enemies for some massive explosions. 

-Customization is nice, when it comes to character design Bioware could take a bit more lessons from Larian Studios. I feel we need more hair, tattoo, facial hair and other options. Character abilities and profiles are really fun to mix and match and there are a lot of powerful combos out there. 

-Lore is interesting. I like how they integrated a ""welcome center"" in the Nexus for any new Andromeda life they encounter to find out about Milky Way life forms. Also good for new players who jump directly into this one. 

The Mixed
-Planet design is hit and miss. I found some planets to be super enjoyable and fun, Especially the Snow, Desert and well other Desert planet. I hated the Jungle planet and the ""Asteroid"" Planet could have been more developed.
-Some of your favorite aliens didn't make the cut. Not Quarian, Drell or Jellyfish for you here. There are hints that they may have been planned for DLC or future content but sadly they met their fate on the cutting room floor. 
-You cannot control your teammates the extent you could in ME 2 and ME 3. This makes it hard for them to be of any help in combat at times. I noticed it especially when dealing with boss type monsters, on Insanity they are bullet sponges and when allies can't chain combos with you it take a loooonnng time to down some enemy types( Behemoths, Destoyers and Fiends especially!).

In fact it was close to the time and the reason I moved to Steam from Origin for my main source of games. The account handling on EA is terrible. Not that Steam's is much better, but it is better nonetheless.

For the game, I have played it since launch, and so I did for Mass Effect all titles. It is unfair to judge this one any different. When Mass Effect 1 first launched, it was in a sorry state worse than Andromeda's, and so was Mass Effect 2 and 3.  Mass Effect 3 had so many issues with game breaking bugs that you had to know where to pass by or where to stand in a lot of situations, or else the game would not trigger the needed progress. It also had a lot of strange angles and poses of camera. To this day some stuff just dont work.

This game, Andromeda, actually has a good story and despite being obviously rushed from early in the story, and completed with very little finishing touches, it is still to me an important part of the Mass Effect overarching story, and I am very pleased that Devs said Mass Effect 5 (those who say Mass Effect 4 are deluded) will have Andromeda as part of its canon.

From gameplay perspective, as I dont care about multiplayer, this game is really good. I guess I havent played it as much as ME original trilogy, but that is because I have moved a little bit to the sandbox survival games after I moved on from Origin, as EA is very weak on that genre.

The game reminds me very strongly of ME1. The RPG-style gear system, the mako-analog, scanning planets... it's back to basics in the most nostalgic way possible. Are there many well-documented bugs? Yep, but they're not game-breaking anymore. I enjoy my companions (minus Cora and Liam), though unfortunately not quite as much as the OG companions.
What really makes this game shine are the small details. This game is, in fact, all small details, from your companions chatting to the constant chatter in the marketplaces to enough immersive emails to outweigh the Tempest. The big choices don't matter very much, but honestly, how much do I care about that when there's an infinite deluge of tiny little cute, heartwarming, or deeply touching individual choices?
I don't think this game is particularly replayable, but given that I wasn't even expecting to play it once, I'm fine with that.
The game is also beautiful. The transition between each planets is slow (your ship literally pulls away and flies to the next planet, taking 5-8 seconds), but so soothing that even though you can skip it, I never do. This game is for people who like to balance their combat with slow-paced talking. If you loved the 10-hour citadel intro in ME1, this game is for you.
The combat is excellent. The multiplayer is fun. 100% reccommend based on that alone.
Oh, and you can change every aspect of your character's appearance (EVERY aspect, minus which Ryder you're playing) via a terminal in your bedroom, so that rocks.
Mods greatly improve the QOL when playing (shoutout to shut up SAM, faster kadara doors, and quickloot all in one) but are technically not necessary.
So, yeah, if you're craving more of that ME1 style but with the most beautiful graphics and exponentially improved combat, this is the game for you.

I saw a lot of bad reviews and news because the story was short and you could finish the game in a few hours. Which in a way is true the story is indeed short but here are my take aways from the game:

I just finished my first playthrough on Normal difficulty which took me about 74,6 Hours, now you probably
think how is that even possible if the story is only a few hours? Well there is alot you can do in this game beside the story, because it is open world!

I completed my second playthrough on Insanity difficulty which took me 6 Hours. I only focussed on the main storyline just to see how quick i could complete it. (i played on Insanity difficulty for the achievement & to see if it was really much harder)

My build that i used for my Insanity run: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOj_MzEJ3Ts&t=0s[/url]

There are tons of side quests, tasks, companion missions and much more to do. (But i will let you figure that out on your own :D)

So there are 2 choices in my opinion: If you like to play games just for the story then this game might not be
for you because of the short story, BUT if you like open world games and you like to focus on other stuff apart from only the story then i think you might like this game.

Combat was really fun, much better than Mass Effect Legendary Edition. Music was nice, and visuals were really great. Facial animations could definitely be better, but otherwise beautiful game.

A galaxy wide epic conflict against cosmic terror is hard to top, and Andromeda's team was short staffed and plagued with unrealistic expectations from all sides.

Yes, it has some janky bits, and the rushed development towards the end means the writing isn't top notch all the time and the game lacks some polish.  There are plenty of times where I could imagine it being a better game, and I'm sure the developers felt the same way.

Not buying and enjoying what is there because of reviews is a terrible choice for what is still an awe inspiring piece of art and fiction.  People still put a lot of heart into this game and it's still a fun time, but demands of an industry driven by profit did stifle what it could have been.

I think you owe it to yourself, if you enjoy the IP, to buy it if you haven't, play it for what it is without the hyped expectations, and maybe the corporate overlords will look more favorably on the IP in the future.

I worked on this for about two days when I originally started and tried to play, coming back to it after about a year to try again with new resources (software mostly) after family/life obligations gave me some space. I WILL update this review if I sort the issue; please note that a 'thumbs-down' from me here is not a matter of subjective faults or hacking away at the collective result of the product development, but a core focus of user experience. Yes, I have an excellent technical background, confidently 99th percentile in fields relevant, to try and sort this out, but most players do not and must rely on third party support, and that's a real problem when you have a fussy engine/platform/whatever. Moving on...~

I loved MA 1-3, so I finally picked up MA-A.... I have not been able to get more than 15 minutes out of it without a handful of major engine crashes though. I am working in 4k@60hz with a very good system (5ghz+ 9900k, 2100+ cclock 2080UXC clocked high, graphene thermal interfacing, silicon lotto winner chips, blah blah blah, great random access, all the good hardware stuffs with non-island-ed stability, backed off 5% for additional headroom). Best case so far, I've tried backing it off, but for some reason anything that kicks the tex cache up to my card's VRAM cap (soft cap, leaving about 512mB reserved for a few reasons not important here), which happens really really quickly, instead of culling the whole thing just blows up. Haven't seen an engine do that since.... I don't even remember.

ANYWAYS... I'm not blaming anything specifically or anyone... I'm not a skill-less consumer, I don't care WHY it's ""broken"", ""who"" holds the blame, just HOW. I'm going to take a look at everything ground up and try to get this working, as I gave up on it after a less than average attack on the parameters. (I'm someone who will manage resources and threads directly through ProcessHacker when needed, I have multiple CS degrees, etc etc, just for a better frame of my opinion).

I really did enjoy the series, I know this one isn't super aligned with 1-3, but it does seem to be enjoyable at least, and somewhat pretty. I will update this review if I find an error which has nothing to do with the technical plague this game has earned the development groups much bad press. If I really, really have to, I'll ring back the internal resolution enough to keep a full tex cache (my 2080 only has 8gB VAM, which is really unfortunate for that generation as it limits the card extensively relative to the class of other subcomponents). Having a long list of excellent performance and stability history on my core machine with much more bloated high performance/quality software makes it all the more frustrating, and all of the aforementioned technical stuffs can be assumed to be at least briefly evaluated with attempted solutions.

Best case, I'll find reprieve in newer low level driver configurations; possibly involving the card I/O and management of the cache functions/distribution/characteristics. After giving everything about 50% effort for diagnosis (low-ish effort in the past from frustration/burnout), I am highly confident that keeping the texture cache (or really I should be saying ALL active VRAM pages below my soft cap aggregate) will solve the issue. I could probably get it to run alright if I cut the internal resolve to 50% or anything less than 2K@60, but it's reallllllly noticeable(like worse than switching from SS/MS AA to totally disabled AA type of difference) as I use a 60"" 4k monitor from about 4ft/~1.2m away, bad enough where I chose to just totally abandon continuing a personal 'Top Five' favorite series entirely.

Hope it works. I guess if I get pissed off enough about it, I'll just play 1-3 again with an all renegade approach or something fun. I apologize for the wordiness of this review and for ""talking about myself"". Reviews being exposed to subjective bias, even with the ~most~ actively fair reviewer, usually paint a much better picture when the reviewer themselves becomes known, in a qualitative sense; example provided, a 14 year old kid with zero real experience in anything beyond clearing search engine history so their parents don't find the porno stash vs a middle aged computer scientist and engineering autodidact polymath likely will be worlds apart in both accuracy and practicality when they both say ""It's broken"". This is especially problematic with non-techy kids can't get a game to run leaving a negative review vacuum waiting to be filled.

Alright. I'm done for now. I'll try to get this all sorted tonight while I have time, and hopefully... Then update my review to something more positive.

Half of the players have stopped playing before it even gets going. Strange. You know, the original trilogy wasn’t the best thing in the world either. Just because you saw a sex scene in it as a kid doesn't make the games great.

The best part of Mass Effect is the feeling of being inside a new vast universe with interesting cultures and aliens. At the same time it has always been a frankly strange mixture of Halo and The Sims. Somehow it works.

Actually, the fact that this is so similar to the earlier ME games, can be seen as a weakness. With the open world this could’ve been something so much more. Maybe this is why players were disappointed?

And the open world can be problematic. While the amount of missions increases, so should the quality of writing. Here it doesn’t. To have a good time, stay focused on the main story, because the side missions give you very little.

I went into this game with an open mind even though I've heard many people say the game isn't good. While some people may not like it, I found it quite enjoyable. 

The main story is pretty good with your typical Bioware hero style game. The main story is easy to follow and throws some interesting ideas at you which is nice. The main story isn't anything revolutionary, but still is enjoyable to play through. It has a good foundation and is executed in a decent manner. 

The companions overall are enjoyable. The mingling on the ship with passing by conversation is worth listening to as some are serious, while some are just down right hilarious. The inter-party banter while exploring is well done and there is plenty of it. They each have their own personality, and while some are better than others for sure, they still feel like different people. 
The quests for your companions are interesting and offer some decent diversity between them. These quests have some memorable, funny and heart-felt moments. 
Being a Bioware game, most of the characters have romance options. Compared to the other Bioware games the romance options hold up and feel genuine. That being said, some of the characters romance options feel very lacking and not fleshed out properly, but some of them felt well executed. 

The side quests are a mixed bag. While some are interesting with a clear importance, others feel lacking and overall like filler quests. Now I understand most games have filler quests to some extent and this game does not over use them. The negative I will say is I wish the more important feeling side quests had more ramifications for your actions during them. 

I ran into a couple of graphical bugs but nothing game breaking. The game 'crashed' twice in the 50 hours of gameplay. I say 'crashed' because the game didn't actually crash, but a weird graphical bug tried to reset my Video Settings and wouldn't let me do anything on the screen. I closed the game and restarted it and it was fine. 

For those of you who have the EA Play launcher and not origin, be aware, FROSTY MODS WILL NOT WORK. They can work if you use Frosty Fix with Frosty Mod manager. I spent a couple of hours trying to get mods to work only to find out why they weren't working so be aware.

Overall, I enjoyed the game. It has a lot of content to offer which is what I was looking for and I enjoy Bioware games (We don't talk about the Anthem tragedy). If you have played the original Mass Effect Trilogy or Dragon Age games, I would recommend keeping an open mind to it and trying it out.",1667869377,1667869377,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I started this game a couple months after I blew through legendary edition, so I wouldn't feel so disconnected from Shepherd and the gang, and honestly it was a good decision. 31 hours in and I haven't had a single solid reference to the original trilogy, not that its a bad thing, just odd. Despite all this, I still think it holds its own quite well as a Mass Effect game, the story is thrilling (to me), being thurst into an entirely new galaxy, light years away from the Milky Way means that the sky is the limit. What threats, what enemies, what friends will there be in this new expanse? 

Gameplay wise, its not very new, and imo a bit restrictive on the powers. Where ME trilogy let you hotkey upto 8 (I think) powers, you are restricted to 3 only. However, you are able to freely swap between different ""Profiles"" as long as you meet the criteria to do so. I am playing a pure Biotic this first play through, hence why I find it a bit restricting. Gun play feels about the same as other 3rd person shooters, and the cover system is great, no buttons needed to snap onto walls, just walk up to it and your character does the rest. Evading feels good too, the Adept and Explorer Profiles have bonuses to evasion.

The Characters are where I'm struggling, I'm playing as male Ryder, and the voice actor does a fine job, however the facial models are a bit static and sort of break immersion. For a 2017 game you'd hope itd be a bit better, no matter though, I find myself reading the dialogue and listening to voice lines to carry me through. The VA's do a good job for the most part, though I don't find anyone to be particularly memorable such as the likes of Garrus, Wrex, Miranda and so one, only the character from the new alien race. My best companion build would be Peebee and Cora though I find Peebee to be so cringe/annoying that I never include her. I usually opt for Cora/Jaal.

Honestly this seems like its mostly negative but it really is a great game once you start it. I do have a gripe with the galaxy transit system, I think ME3 did a better job, I really don't like sitting through cutscene after cutscene when I go from planet to planet.

By the standards of similar open world games, the quality of the missions/quests and plot line are pretty good. There's some thin filler, but it's ignoreable, and there's plenty of better situated story-advancing and world-defining stuff to find. The main plot line and crew missions have good moments, touching or inspiring, and the world outside of the Tempest crew is full of characters with personality and dialog worth listening to. The crew chatter on and off the Tempest is well executed, and the combat is dynamic and fluid by RPG standards.

Coming from the line of Mass Effect games set a high bar, though. The decisions in this game are relatively few and just fail to have much weight. I really wanted the decision between establishing a scientific or military first colony to have impact, and it just doesn't. A few characters approved or disapproved, but I felt like a military base should have maybe provided real support later but set back relationships with the local aliens. And so on. It's nearly impossible to wreck relationships with anyone, on or off your crew. Almost no one can die by way of your mistakes, or take a different path through life. It's sad, after the original series made a point of including some real consequences. The characters in MEA are good, but also are just a bit less compelling than ME's best efforts.

On the other hand, I hated being forced into the strict Paragon or Renegade binary choice, and prefer the subtler optiions (if only they still had some consequences...). And the gameplay is more fun than the strict cover mechanics of the first 3. And I rather liked the somewhat lighter tone and didn't miss the ""end of the galaxy"" level threat that frankly left ME3 backed into a corner out of which there was no really good way to end the story reasonably.

So, this game may not satisfy the die hard ME fans, but I'd recommend it. I wish I hadn't put off playing it for years based on the mediocre reception it received. It's a good game. Just not a genre defining great.",1667185965,1667185965,True,19,3,0.667205691337585449,0,True,False,False

It's a good game, and has a decent story. Combat is pretty polished, and it has some nice tie-ins with the original ME games. If you are a fan of ME and want just a little bit more, or perhaps a palette cleanser after the ending of ME3, this is a good place to turn.

But it is far from perfect. There are lots of redundancies in the game - missions, dialogue, mechanics like strike teams, etc. By the time you get a third of the way through the game it starts feeling like you're just performing the same actions over and over again.

The UI is terrible. Orbital exploration is a chore, and there are weird and nonsensical decisions made like mousing over the 'confirm' button in the loadout screen shifts it to the right and you end up unequipping an item. You learn to navigate around these things, but overall the UI feels like an ok first attempt that should have been further refined before the game's release. Not a deal breaker, but it was a persistent annoyance.

It felt incomplete, like it was a rush job that needed more fleshing out.

There was a lot of good though, and I would still recommend the game to ME lovers, even though there will probably never be a follow up title to wrap up loose ends.

Planetary exploration is fun, and there are lots of side missions and places to go to keep you busy. I liked the research and development functionality, although after maybe a quarter of the way through the game the resources needed to craft things were never an issue. It's easy to identify the most effective weapon / armor / mod combinations that suit your playstyle, so as long as you kept the focus on those, you don't really run out of the resources you need to craft / update them.

The combat is much more fluid than ME and the jump/hover mechanics was fun and tactically useful. The characters felt flat at first but the game provides enough time with them to make them feel like they came into their own.

Overall I'd give it a 6.5/10 because it WAS a fun and engaging game that's worth playing, but the shortfalls are frequent and it's impossible to not see how fantastic this game had the potential to be if they had spent more time to do it right, which is a shame.",1667174489,1667174489,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

None of the characters (Pathfinder included) are all that compelling except Drak: essentially ""old man"" Wrex and, therefore, EXCELLENT.

Some of that bad news is warranted some of it is not. This game is the Dragon Age 2 of Mass Effect imo. What I mean by this is that it's an offshoot compared to the original trilogy, it's different, the storyline in my opinion isn't as good by far and a few of the characters are somewhat lackluster. Having said that it's not a bad game at all if you simply consider it a spinoff off of Mass Effect, the combat is fun although it's got a little bit too much jumping for my tastes and they introduced a detective mode like in the Batman games where you scan stuff for clues and whatnot. if you're a diehard Mass Effect fan who will accept nothing but the best, you will be severely disappointed in this game in fact it might be a complete disaster for you, on the other hand if you're a diehard Mass Effect fan and have a completely open mind then this is worth a playthrough for sure, just to see something different. There's no way I can give this a thumbs down because it's not a bad game it's just different along with some issues as I mentioned above. If it's super cheap and you don't mind playing  a 'spin off' give it a try.

Edit: Just wanted to add that they went semi open world with this game (ala Dragon Age Inquisition) which is good and bad. The good is that you'll have a LOT of things to do most of which is side quests called tasks which you can skip the majority of but there's tons of material to mine\gather and lots of crafting if that’s your thing. The bad thing is this detracts from the story line(s) which Bioware games are known for.

If you're prepared to accept that this isn't the original trilogy, and that the pace, atmosphere and narrative is going to be much different, then you'd probably enjoy it too. IMO, its a game worth getting, especially on a discount.

Combat - Combat is an improvement over ME3/ME2. The fighting feels clean and punchy, and it's more mobile than the cover-oriented combat in the original trilogy.

Missions - There are too many tedious missions. Apart from the main story and loyalty (allies & relationship) missions which are good, the bulk of the side missions are not very impressive or exciting. Thankfully, all of them can be easily ignored without major consequences to the story.

Premise & Story - As mentioned, this isn't the ME trilogy. You're not on a race against time to save the galaxy, this is a story about exploration and the game is built around this narrative. While the planets and scenery are gorgeous, there are still quite a few mistakes and let-downs though. Firstly, the writing is at times wonky - the main story is okay but isn't amazing. Secondly, the various factions and their motivations aren't anything special. The main antagonist is pretty bland too and doesn't have complex motivations (but there are hints of a larger and more interesting story probably for sequels). There is however decent character development for the player. I really enjoyed the process of seeing Ryder grow from a rookie explorer to a leader who has gained the trust of his/her team and the Initiative.

The facial animation is a bit wanky, but you can ignore it after a few hours of playing. It is more of a cover shooter, so a methodical approach is your way to go, which is fine, but the game should tell you and have a better cover system.
There are a lot of interesting side quests and tasks to keep you having diverse gameplay, which is a great plus for me.
I did not like the equipment management at all - I crafted a very powerful assault riffle pretty soon and crafting almost lost any meaning for me. Also, having to choose gear before entering a planet was quite disappointing.
Additionally, you have to play with mods to get rid of several nuisances (e.g. automatic item pickup from storages and enemies), so it is a shame that steam workshop does not have mods and you need to go to an external site to get them.

Despite all that, the story and gameplay are good enough to offset that I enjoyed it a lot.

When news of Mass Effect 4 or 5 is now coming I bought the Legendary for the OT and now this Deluxe Edition for Andromeda. Way better on PC than Xbox.  It's a great game. Bioware had it's headaches during making of this product within the company. But you can tell there was a a lot of people that still cared for ME in Andromeda. Don't let all the bad rep for this game prevent you from getting this. 

It's a new story and it's good. The only thing I hate about it is they never made a second game for Andromeda. Bioware told us the OT will continue. But if your like me that's a die hard fan, play this and enjoy it for what it is.

Not many other games I see make me want to buy them. So I play what the good ones are and replay them. Until ME will continue...So sit back and go explore with Ryder and the Tempest crew! My heart goes out to you Avela!!",1666628144,1666628144,True,23,0,0.683543503284454346,0,True,False,False

This is the jankiest, buggiest, and most unpolished Mass Effect so far. Graphical glitches like menu flashing and weird color reflections aren't uncommon even this far after release. Some quests felt like they had so much more planned behind them and they were left in as an oversight (see Drack's Fire Breathing Thresher Maw Quest) and many quest markers like certain NPCs and their voiced lines, repeat long after their quests are done. The potential of this game is saddening in a way that is reminiscent of Halo Infinite, one of many games to suffer the push into a sort of mediocrity by eager and greedy publishers. 

At the same time however, this game has the best combat and exploration of the Mass Effect series so far. It also is chock full of lore, some fun and dynamic moments (though I wish there was way more!), and is ultimately a good space travelling adventure. What it does good isn't the best by any other games standards, but it is really good as a Mass Effect game despite all the hate. There are things that i genuinely love about this game (ahem Vetra main) and they scratch the itch that only the Mass Effect series can, so that is why I recommend this game to any Mass Effect fan completely. To non-fans, i'd say you should build a love for ME through the first 3 before coming to this game if you want the best experience. While it has quality of life upgrades from the last, it will pummel you down with the jank, so the first 3 give you the bias to enjoy this one much more. 

Multiplayer is tacked on, but its a fun sort of wave survival mode.
Also! You should definitely try Wavebend's 1st person toggle mod. I used it for half my playtime and it was a real fun experience to change up the Mass Effect combat loop. You'll have to do some sleuthing to find it but its worth it to see the ME world up close and personal.

    [*] Multiple Choices
    [*] Character Customization
    [*] Very well thought out story and unique characters that you build bonds with or against.
[/list]

[b] The Negatives [/b]
[list]
    [*] Had a bug where I drank from a glass at the bar and there was no glass so he was just holding nothing (very small bug).
    [*] When you run to fast or jet pack when they are talking to each other they will stop mid sentence which can kill the RPG element.
    [*][spoiler] I created a sister and rarely saw her. Why was she not in the game more when I guarantee others spent more time creating a sibling to them. [/spoiler]

Late to Andromeda - played and loved ME1, 2, and 3.  It's a pleasant sequel.  You can still immerse yourself in the vastness of galactic exploration with compelling story lines, but overall isn't by any stretch an ""improvement"", but a capitalization on what made 2 and 3 work.  Combat is pretty much the same; fun.  The relationships, however, seem too easily formed.  Mere flirtation nearly immediately upon interacting with crew, strangers, or organizational contacts feels fake.  And the sheer abundance of sexual fluidity was confusing.  You effectively get to choose whether *other* characters are gay, which was just confusing.  I don't mind inclusion of that sort, but it's distracting and, again, feels fake.

For example, in ME1, Ashley Williams was someone I actually felt a closeness to, but wanted to ""feel it out"".  And so the subsequent events, accidentally causing her death, had a much more powerful impact on me - carrying over to ME2, because those relationships were far more complex and gradual.  They felt natural.  In fact, I had visceral resentment that I had caused Ashley to die and Kaiden lived.  His mere existence in ME2 was an emotive experience that I truly appreciated in how carefully the boundaries of reality and fantasy were woven together in the former titles.

I still look forward to the ending of Andromeda, as someone who thought ME3's ending was fine.  Very creative situation including twins as character models.  I eat up all the call-backs to the series with voices and mentions of familiar lore, and never disappointed by the ways they include those aspects.

Seems like they missed the mark on resource management or friendly immersion into what qualifies as valuable items or currency.

At this point, that's the best estimation I have, and would recommend this to anyone jumping into the series either for the first time or looking to relive what made the franchise so successful and memorable.",1665952392,1665952392,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mass Effect: Andromeda had a bumpy launch and still has a negative shadow to it that it never managed to lose, despite various updates fixing a large amount of the bugs it had on its disastrous launch. However, it is honestly a fun game focused on exploration, discovery and combat, and it does all of these surprisingly well. The story is okay, it's nothing special and can be quite predictable at times. It doesn't really need to be set in the Mass Effect Universe either, it could easily have been its own game, but it is nice seeing previous species and even brief cameos from the original trilogy return.
The Story is set almost 600 years after the events of the original trilogy, as the various species of the milky way look to escape a looming threat. You play as Ryder, and your adventure will take you all across the Heleus Cluster of the Andromeda Galaxy, fighting new foes and making new allies. The Story does seem to end on a bit of a cliffhanger, and even a rumoured DLC was canned after the awful release.
The Gameplay is so good. It is nice and fluid, unlike the original trilogy which feels extremely clunky compared to this. Powers combo much better and abilities can easily be swapped between. Gunplay has however taken a small fall as it feels the game prioritised abilities over the actual weapons so they feel a bit like water pistols. The modding system allows for great customisation of these weapons and armors, which is also a nice touch.
The Graphics are also surprisingly good, however often seem to struggle when transitioning from a bright outdoor area to a dimly lit or dark area, as it takes a while for the new lighting to kick in. Not a bad looking game though!
The Bugs in this game are now mostly gone, but some still remain. Missions softlocking themselves, crashes and various graphical issues still remain, and yes, the facial expressions are still not great.
Overall, Mass Effect: Andromeda is a lot of fun, making many improvements on the original trilogy in terms of gameplay and visuals, but honestly falls short in everything else. Is it worth a play through? Yes. Should you expect a sequel from BioWare? No. Play at your own risk.
Mass Effect: Andromeda gets a 6/10.

[b]Comment:[/b]
There is a bad reputation this game has but really it is just an uninspired story. Trying to copy the original trilogy way too much. Instead it should have explored entirely new things. A lot of focus is on appeasing the fans of the series. This causes ME:A to lose it's identity and be forgettable. However, there are still some things to explore and enjoy. Like the new species and gorgeous planets. Also the companions are nice to interact with. A pretty neutral thing for me is the skill system. Unlike the previous games you can switch around skills independent on class and even reset. It is cool to try out but frankly takes away replayability. The combat can feel repetitive sometimes but I found it to be plenty of fun. Mainly the boss fights can be really cool. Plus the gun modifications are my favourite addition. Slapping on a Vintage Heat Sink augmentation and thus getting rid of the need to pick up ammo is awesome. Or change fire type from single shot to auto ... or from slugs to laser beam! What I found annoying is the quest distribution. It is purposefully done in a way that you have to travel back and forth between destinations. With the loading taking as long as it does (even on an SSD) it gets old really fast. The Nomad vehicle (or Mako 2.0) is okay and even fun in the low gravity areas. This game is worth exploring if you enjoy the ME universe and are willing to forgive the shortcomings. On a good sale it can be a decent buy.

[b]P.S.:[/b] The Deluxe Edition has 2x armour (Deep Space Explorer, Scavenger), 3x vehicle skin, 4x weapons (Pathfinder Elite set), 2x outfit, a pet Pyjak on the ship, digital soundtrack & a bunch of multiplayer boosts. Apart from that there were four multiplayer recruit packs (DLCs) - Asari Adept, Turian Soldier, Krogan Vanguard, Salarian Infiltrator. The first two are also part of the [u]Steam[/u] deluxe edition though.

[b]*Note: The review is mainly for the game which can be enjoyable, not what it is like to play it via Steam. To that part - just like many other Origin games released 2011-2020 - it is unfortunately better to buy the Origin-only version. It is not as bad as the Dragon Age games but still the Origin version has better fps, less crashes and can be played offline...[/b]

I did with MEA what I do with other sequels - I put away my expectations based on the originals. I played original Mass Effect trilogy (MEOT) a lot. I love the lore and universe.

IMO, MEA gave me more lore, more universe, more questions to chew on and more things to think about. It gave me choices and outcomes of those choices.

I didn't expect, or want, MEA to be like MEOT. And that's exactly what I got. 

With the patches and updates, I think this version of MEA is a fine game, and one that I am going to be doing replays through, to catch things I missed, or take paths I didn't take the first time.",1665433912,1665433912,True,18,0,0.655270159244537354,0,True,False,False

Despite all that I felt like the game was fine.

Then I got to the end. Not only is the end an absolute chore, it's not hard or challenging it's just kill x amount of enemies now wait for what feels like 5 solid minutes for something to happen while constantly being attacked. You do that 3 times, it's just waves of the same 4 enemies you've been fighting since the beginning. But it's not just that, I can excuse a lame combat section. No what pisses me off is the utter garbage of the story. The mental gymnastics and stupid plot contrivances that have to come together to make the ending play out the way it does are fascinating in their stupidity. 

Without trying to spoiler anything, it relies on established facts to no longer be facts, things that work a certain way have to stop working that way for the ending to happen. Worse is they couldn't just have it be a straightforward ending, most of it would have worked without the plot contrivance, all the main points of the ending could stay the same, the issue is the lead up. That coupled with the incredibly boring final battle that drags on forever and the big bad evil guy who has been a pain in your neck throughout the whole game literally dying in a cutscene. Not even a QTE, nor do you attack or anything, he just dies. In a cutscene. I swear I had a blank look on my face throughout, there was no feeling of ""Yay I did it"" I felt numb. 

Then in the post credits you talk to all of your crew members which made me remember that Mass Effect had such great characters in 1-3 because they weren't immortal. You could lose crew members. There were stakes involved. In Andromeda they're just background dressing, pick your 2 favourites and do their quests, there's no reward or reason to do any of the others. The only smile I had at the end of the game was seeing the banter between the Turian sisters Sid and Vetra, I romanced Vetra and it was a nice little moment.

If you love the original Mass Effect trilogy, you will enjoy this. Definitely not on the same scale with the original ME trilogy, but ME: Andromeda certainly has its own entertaining value. The gameplay is fun and easy to maneuver, albeit rather slow on the plot. It takes almost pass 50% in the game for the story to reach its climax, and there are some plot holes left (but I think that's fine knowing the game doesn't have its sequel and the one who written it probably thought it would be explained on the sequels). The characters are decent, especially the Ryders, but obviously not on the same level as Shepard.

The villains are underdeveloped, but maybe because it's just one game. [spoiler] Honestly, they are really similar with the Reapers from original ME (in terms of villains goals), the difference is it takes 3 games for the Reapers to get their full extent of villainess. [/spoiler]

1. Fights are interesting and challenging sometimes (if you don't min-max).
2. World building is great. Plenty of readable data logs, side-character interactions and random npc conversations.
3. The graphics are fine (facial movements are weird sometimes) but considering this is a 2017 game, my RTX3060 can max out graphics settings at 1080p easily.

CONS:
1. Real-time timers to APEX Missions & AVP rewards (obviously designed to sell microtransactions)
2. I'm still seeing quite a bit of bugs 5 years after release
3. Crafting relies on research points to develop (some are quite hard to obtain, probably a microtransaction decision design AGAIN)

Maybe I made the mistake of trying to play this after a complete 1-2-3 legendary playthrough but I honestly don't see myself ever playing this past literally the first mission and if I ever do it will be out of spite and done entirely in anger.

[h1]Revision 1: (60 hrs in)[/h1] 

It's not Rubbish. Also; There is no mass effect story here. This is game called ""The Andromeda Initiative"" about how humans left for a 600 year sleep to another galaxy and some of the ships got lost and we gotta find em. Oh and there are Aliens that moved in while we were asleep. Oops.jpg

It's an entirely different weapons, armor and powers system with an entirely different focus on 'skill trees' and augmentations (that are terrible unless you mod them). Everything feels so foreign to mass effect that if it didn't say ""Mass Effect"" on the tin and they weren't shoving the beloved mass effect aesthetic down your throat with zero tact it really would be a fine stand alone. 

And then there is the combat. I stand behind my original statement. it's battlefield. BUT WORSE. You're running and jumping all over the place, hovering and spraying. There is no ""stealth"" or ""Tactics"" every planet is just go here. Do your ""fetch-em"" quests with awful spawn rates while seeing copy-paste camp after camp on otherwise beautiful planets. Remember in the original game how you could stealth into a combat area? use cover-to-cover keys to guarantee concealed moments? Remember how if you approached cover and pressed the button to enter it you would STAY in it and be able to peek left right and over the top? Apparently these devs don't remember.

I would be so much less critical of this game if they didn't try to shoe-horn in the mass effect IP. Then we could focus on THIS unique and different game some exec said ""But it wouldn't it sell better if we slapped mass effect on the box and put at least 1 sexy blue alien in there for the player to fvck?""

[h1]100+hrs. Game completed:[/h1] 

Fine. You can have your recommendation. It was still very battlefield in the combat. But there WAS a mass effect story in there. A real one. Yes it was clear there was another game shoe-horned in here but when you add 30 mods and get things ""just right"" there is a mass effect game in there. The writing panned out. There were goofs, gaffs, laughs and all the rest. It even suffered from the classic disjointed nature of ME questing with fan-favorites such as: [i]""Oh you forgot to get this obscure thing 40 hours ago? Well that's that quest in the garbage, lol get good scrub""[/i]. And don't forget: [i]""Hang on, should I be doing this quest first? Or this one? or that one?""[/i] But now a new one! [i]""brb gotta go get my AVP and send a bunch of teams off on strike missions because i have no idea""[/i].

And while there are hundred other little things that no one cares about. One big one is [b]RNG TASKS/MISSIONS[/b]. Are you kidding me? Nearly a dozen ""go-fetch-em"" quests where the encampment really probably doesn't have what you're looking for and it's obvious they want you to leave planet (and the game) and come back and do this again. 3,4 or 5 times before you get everything. To hell with that. I always 100% everything. I left those quests un-done and you can too. Pure nonsense mechanics to get you to sink massive hours into your gameplay only to vastly over-level (and un balance) your character by farming these camps. Don't do it. Just play naturally. I think I got one by accident towards the end. 

Other than that. I have to give it the thumbs up [b]for 7 the dollars I paid[/b]. The ending was satisfying and left me (shamefully) wanting Mass Effect Andromeda 2: Scourge Boogaloo. Even with all the jump-jet-action-packed-battlefield nonsense wedged in there.

I came to this game fresh from playing the original ME trilogy (remastered versions) for the first time and knowing this was a spin-off, vastly disconnected from the original games (though there are some references to the old galaxy).

I can say this: It's not as bad as the memes and hate suggested, but it also doesn't necessarily ~feel~ like a Mass Effect game (because it's a spin off, remember?). This is much more open-world(s) than the trilogy, so there's lots and lots of exploration to be done if you're into that or a completionist like me. Think Assassins Creed Odyssey but like 1000 years in the future in a galaxy far far away. The old enemies aren't here, there are some new ones with different motivations that you slowly uncover through the course of the game. Otherwise, the gameplay itself feels good, in terms of the gunplay familiar to those who played the original trilogy.

Its a good game. But don't come into this spinoff thinking you're going to get Mass Effect 4 because it's certainly not meant to be that. The story is good, not amazing, but still worthwhile. The gameplay is good and will feel familiar. Be prepared for more exploration if you're into it, or just ignore the side quests if you want to play a linear campaign (not that the original trilogy didn't have its fair share of side quests).

If you like the Mass Effect WORLD and background lore, and not just whatever you saw in the original campaigns, you'll like Andromeda if you accept it as part of the expanded universe (literally) rather than a direct sequel.

Mass Effect ™: Andromeda Deluxe Edition is the next installment in the world of Mass Effect. This time we move to the neighboring galaxy - Andromeda. And before I start, I need to clarify something. I don't normally write RPG reviews after 20 hours, but this is an exception. I hate this game with a burning passion. Every time (at least once a month) I play this game to give it a second chance, and after at least 30 minutes I am just fed up with everything, tired and pissed. I'm not going to torture myself with this thing anymore. Maybe someday, but that time will not come soon.
[h1]The Plot[/h1]
Well, we start the game in Andromeda on the Ark 600 years after the events of the trilogy. The Arks were supposed to be sent to Andromeda somewhere around Mass Effect 2, which is weird because, apart from the fact that no one has mentioned this in other games, generally at that time there would be no good reason to evacuate to another galaxy. But about our main character, he has the role of Pathfinder, that is, someone who explores planets looking for suitable habitats (an interesting concept in itself). The Ark has some problems, we discover a race of evil aliens, etc. What do I think about it? Well, it's awful because it's the laziest plot ever written. It is practically a copy of what we had in the trilogy (we turn on a certain machine that gives us a goal, we fight evil aliens, and we are helped by the artifacts of extinct civilization). Only worse is that nobody here has any motivation. The chief bad guy and his gang of clowns have no bigger plan, they're bad guys because why not. Even the way they operate is nothing new, they just want to mutate everyone into their puppets. Same as in the trilogy, only here, nobody knows why they do it. The main character and his crew are another joke. The main character himself has no motivation, he is confused and unsure of himself all the time, which makes every character he interacts with simply ridicule and question him. The rest of our crew is even worse. They don't bring anything interesting to the story, they do not take anything seriously and they do not respect us. I have no idea if the voice actors didn't give a shit in the same way as the animators, but if they did, it's no wonder because you can see and hear it. As for the plot itself, apart from the fact that it is a copy of better games, we have here plot twists similar to Scooby Doo's. There is even a situation where we come to a certain location where we spend a lot of time in, only to find out at the end that this is a wrong location and we have to go somewhere else and do exactly the same thing. There is no world or character development. I felt no satisfaction whatsoever, only anger, becouse I knew that I wasting my time here. The worst and most boring plot.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Let's start with the character creator. The standard character looks okay. And I know BioWare is not very good at creating character customization, however here we go to a new level where every character I tried to create myself ended up looking like an early stone age caveman. The game also tells us that there is no such thing as specific character classes. The Soldier can use any skills that were locked / available for other classes in the trilogy. It sounds good, but in practice it makes our character a strange hybrid and we just don't known what we are exactly and where our specialization lies. Thank goodness this game has nothing to do with the previous installments so the choice of whether Shepard was male or female is completely irrelevant. But wait, this game was promoted as Better No Man's Sky, where we'll be able to discover planets and their secrets in the world and style of Mass Effect, across the Andromeda galaxy. And how it turned out? Well, it didn't work out, because from the whole galaxy we only have a few planets to see on foot, and these planets are ordinary fields of snow or sand, with a few ruins sticking out of the ground and that's it. Only two planets are interesting. One of these planets is impossible to explore, and the other is just too small to mean anything (and looks exactly like Ilos from Mass Effect 1 except with a purple filter). Side quests are another tragedy. 90% of them are typical ""go there, find something for me, then come back for a reward"". And I know that sometimes it was like that in the trilogy, but there it happened naturally by scanning and exploring the locations, and here the game tells us that these shitty tasks are amazing, when in fact I was dying of boredom. And what else does Andromeda give us? Well, it gives us ONLY two new races (the main baddies and some over-colored Twi'leks from Star Wars). We have nothing else. As for the races, what happened here, we only see them, Humans, Turians, Salarians, Asari and Krogan. There is no trace of other races from the Milky Way. Damn it knows what happened to the Volus, Drell, Quorians, Elcor and the rest. But no, when I think about it, in one sentence they mention that they were lost in other part of Andromeda or something. Genius writing. Going back to the mechanics taken from No Man's Sky, here we have the scanning mechanic. Of course, there is nothing amazing to be seen here, because 80% of things cannot be scanned. Following this way of thinking, we get to know SAM, the artificial intelligence associated with the main character. This is a huge problem because SAM does pretty much everything on its own throughout the storyline. If we gave him a body like EDI, SAM would kill the main bad guy and save the galaxy in the first few minutes without the help of the crew and even the main character. Which again makes everyone but SAM look like idiots, and we're also talking about the developers here who apparently grew up in the jungle half their lives before joining the dev-team of this abomination. I don't know what they were smoking during the development process. But maybe we'll try to be more positive. Everyone praised the new combat system, how well guns work etc. And yes, I admit that this is the best aspect of the game. Which doesn't mean even that aspect isn't shitty if you think about it. Shooting is very bouncy now, like in Fortnite, we can't control what skills our companies are using, and in general I feel like in some cartoon when shooting, jumping like an orangutan with ADHD, every now and then using abilities.
[h1]Technical Matters[/h1]
The river of shit is starting to flow harder and harder. Graphically it looks nice, but only from a distance. Up close, everything is somehow blurry, without details. The character models look like monkeys, their eyes are dead, without the soul or any emotions, and the animations are so stiff that even Knights of the Old Republic from the early 2000s look so much better. Add to that the awful job of the voice actors and we already have a complete disaster. But the tornado of stupidity does not end here, unfortunately. The game works terrible, some textures do not load, the game works for me at max 40 FPS, it often crashes to the desktop and you just need to open one browser in the background while playing and suddenly the game breaks, so you have to restart. The interface is non-intuitive, made in the form of some strange circles, which makes it difficult to navigate. The save system is also terribly made, since normal game saves are not available during missions, and autosaves either don't work or work so infrequently that they might not be there at all. Hours of gameplay can be lost for no reason.
[h1]Summary[/h1]
Andromeda is a game that had some potential but has failed on every front. If they want to continue this, then please go ahead, maybe the next part will be better. But don't let them mix this game by force with Mass Effect 4, I don't want this shit to drag the rest of the ME universe to the bottom.

If you enjoyed the series the lore of ME you will enjoy this game.

 Now for the critical views. There are some missions which are RNG random which were extreamly annoying. I spent over an hour or more going from camp to camp to find something that randomly spawns. It was obnoxious. More quest varitey would of been welcomed I think this is the crux of open world type games, What activites to fill the world with. Most just copy paste the same quests in different location. I think that its a real shame for this type of story because of the massively different locations.

This is slightly different than the other games in the series and greatly expand on Mass Effect 1's exploration game-loop.   In terms of pacing the game has a fairly long exposition but its worth sticking with it.

The story is interesting: Explores the idea of intergalactic travel and the reasoning behind it.(from a fictional sci-fi point of view)  and seems to take inspiration from various science fiction novels.  That said , So far story-wise its a bit of garden of roses compared to how it would have really been in that situation and I think the writers try to spare the Player's feelings instead of giving us the brutal Game of Thrones version. So from what I've seen the harsh realities of pioneer life are downplayed in this game even though romance means its not suitable for children anyways.  Most of the harsh reality stuff happens to aliens but not to humans as to not upset the more conservative trekkie players I guess.

Phase I is the intro, which is the first few hours.  It isn't the best way to introduce everything, as the explanations for systems aren't well described, the combat isn't as fun as it could be, and a lot of the technical issues weren't completely ironed out.

If you survive that, you get Phase II, which is my favorite part.  You go from world to world, knocking out quests and such that make the worlds more viable for habitation.  You obtain resources that let you craft different weapons and armor for yourself to match your playstyle.  If you've played Death Stranding, there's a similar feel to it, as you're building up the world to make it more livable while improving your own bag of tricks.  There's a feeling of (ahem) pride and accomplishment as you see things become better because of your actions.

For example, you land on a world, and there's a bunch of missions to do.  The combat is fun, so even the straightforward ones are enjoyable.  You clear your list, and a few end up saying ""Go to this planet next,"" and the best way to handle this is to just queue up everything offworld until you've done what you can on this one, because:

Phase III is the endgame, and where things lose a ton of momentum.  If you're just blasting the main story, it feels like you can get through pretty quick, but I took my time and knocked out sidequests. The problem comes at the end of these quest chains, as some quests literally have you visiting three or more locations. But leaving and returning involves a few unskippable loading screens.  That makes the end of the quest log a seriously annoying chore, unless you're using a guide of some kind that lets you know where to go next.  I didn't use that, and was punished for it.  There's a video conference thing on your ship and if it had been utilized better, 90% of the travel could have been cut out and the game would have been so much better for it.

There are a few other notes.  The galactic exploration is ultimately pointless, because the things you see are boring.  ME2 had things like missions that opened up when you find an enemy outpost on a world, or ME3 revealing War Assets that make it at least feel unique.  This is entirely, ""Oh, there's a river!""  ""A crater!"" Like, no shit, there's lots of craters, thank you for the XP.  Unless you're fishing for resources or obsessively clear things, I wouldn't bother.

Likewise, it gives you a number of ""tasks"" that boil down to ""perform X action a bunch until you randomly clear the requirements.""  One example is ""Little Mouse,""  a mission on the desert planet which felt like a Dune reference.  ""Cool, let me check this out,"" methinks.  But there are no markers.  The quest is literally, ""Drive around until you get into a fight, and there's a slim chance the next of five datapads is here.  Repeat as necessary.""

I was nearly done with the planet when I stumbled onto the first of these, and every planet has one like it, and they are just not worth it!

Another issue are the number of bugs that persist, especially with quests.  One broke the game and I had to reload from a prior save.  Another didn't show where the quest giver was to turn it in.

It sounds like I'm leaning negative on this, and there are a lot of criticisms, but that middle part was incredibly entertaining.  Underrated, flawed, but still worth a playthrough, especially if you're like me and get it for less than $10.  I'm not sure if they're available, but if there's a ""skip straight to objective"" mod of some kind, I highly recommend seeking it out.",1664563770,1664563770,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I loved exploring open-world maps and the new Mako - Nomad - is definitely easier to navigate. Combat system is very dynamic and I like that now you can jump in combat (no way I'm a Widowmaker in Mass Effect universe). 
There are so many things to do in ME: Andromeda: side quests, research and development, crafting armor and weapons, scanning planets for resources, etc. I really like the variety of extra stuff you can do in this game but it could be a bit too much. It took me a while to figure out how to add mods to the weapons and armor. Some side tasks/quests aren't marked on the map so it's hard to keep track of the progress. Perhaps my main disappointment with this game is the lack of well-written interesting characters, especially your squad mates. The story itself is ok. The original trilogy is way better in this regard. 

Oh, and one last thing. The Remnant Vaults might seem fun at first but they become very frustrating later because of the vague puzzles and lack of direction.

Lemme preface this by saying that this game is... good. Not amazing, not really good, not even necessarily very good. Just good. But I have grown attached to this game in a way I didn't expect.

Everything negative about this game has been said before, so this will mainly mention what I like about this game:

I've always loved mass effect and the OT will always be legendary for its story and characters, but this game especially nails down this [i] FEELING [/i] of exploration. The beauty that the environmental designers created here is beyond anything the series has ever seen and you really feel the love and effort put into it by the devs. The seamless fluidity of combat, the satisfying driving (thanks need for speed team that helped bioware on this) and the exploratory quest design that actually rewards finding and completing small quests, occasionally even giving you entire new areas in the end. Exploration in this game is very obviously what Bioware had imagined the Mako sections in ME1 could become.

Furthermore, the modding community for this game is quite near and dear to me. I rarely play this game with less than 50 mods at a time, and it makes the game so much better. Pushes it from the ""good"" category into the ""very good"" in my opinion. The replayability is so much greater when you suddenly have new powers, new romances, new weapons and armor and so on.

So all in all:
- Good game
- get it on a sale (which happens pretty often)
- you'll have a ton of fun with combat and exploration
- maybe you'll even have enough fun for a second playthrough
- in that case i strongly encourage looking into modding

I found that the game was actually alright, though even this long after its release it still has a lot of bugs, however most of them are not game breaking. I think that this could have been well received had it not been a Mass Effect game, because it is an okay RPG, but significantly subpar to the original trilogy.
The graphics have been improved compared to the original games, however this improvement only effected the environments, the character graphics are quite bad, (it is quite visible that the Frostbite engine was not developed for this type of game, since all characters looked like they were made out of plastic, and the design of the Milky way species was much better and more lifelike in the original series). The combat system has been improved as well, since the jetpack added a verticality to it, furthermore it became more fast paced and quite spectacular, zooming in to the enemies with the charge biotic skill and then doing a Nova strike never seized to be fun, however the improvements stop there.
I believe that beside the story , the characters are the foundation of a good Mass Effect game, both of which were quite disappointing in Andromeda. Some people say that the characters in the first Mass Effect game were not that well defined either, and if Andromeda had a sequel, then maybe they could be improved, which is somewhat true, however it should be kept in mind, that in the first game one of the significant advantages that the characters had over the ones in Andromeda was that they were new. Learning about the Asari, Turian, Quarian and Krogan cultures (which were incredibly well thought out) from Liara, Garrus, Tali, and Wrex made them unique, since it added to their character, given them certain motivations, defined where they came from, and made a foundation upon which the later games could improve. In Andromeda the decision to move away from the Milky way was actually quite good, since following the ending of Mass Effect 3, it would have been quite hard to make a sequel without making the Destroy ending cannon, and keeping at least the core of the crew of the Normandy. The Andromeda galaxy gave way to make a new team, and made it possible for the writers to introduce new species, which could have been a way to keep the franchise fresh, and start a potential new trilogy. The problem is that they introduced only 2 new species, the Kett and the Angara (based on interviews with the writers it happened due to budgetary cuts, time constraints and EA apparently only wanted to make species which people could cosplay as), which would have been  fine in the Milky way, but in a whole new galaxy it did not make much sense. Furthermore they have not even included all species from the Milky way either, since Quarians (not to mention volus drell, hanar, batarian, vorcha) were not present (the Quarians would have been a part of a DLC which was canceled by Bioware in favor of Anthem). The problem with this decision is that, the only character who had the advantage of being new was Jaal , the other characters would have had to be well written enough, not to feel lesser than the crew of the Normandy.  The fact however was that Jaal's culture was not even remotely as new and interesting as the Alien cultures in the OG trilogy were (it lacked originality). In this regard they did not succeed. From the crew of the Tempest only Vetra, Drack, Kallo, and the pilot girl had somewhat okay characters, however even they were more often than not cliche, and by far not unique, or believable. From among the others Peebe was too much like a young rebellious teenager, and therefore quite annoying (keep in mind that Liara was considered quite young with about a hundred years, granted I do not remember how old Peebe is), and she was not even remotely like the calm, wise and collected Asari, which we have gotten to know in the original Mass Effect games. Cora had one defining character trait, which was being a part of the Asari commando, and she just could not let that go, you were unable to have a single conversation with her without it being mentioned, and it got annoying quite quickly. Liam did not have much of a character, and he was therefore uninteresting, I never even had him on my squad beside his loyalty mission. Then there is Ryder, who does not even get close to Shepard as a character. Much like Peebe he feels a bit too young, and undisciplined, and quite a lot of his lines were cheesy (e.g. I know it is cold here, but stay frosty). In general the crew of the Tempest does not even come close to the crew of the Normandy in terms of likability, or complexity.
One of the other major mistakes regarding characters was the fact that SAM did not have any personality whatsoever. After having both EDI and Legion who were both AIs in the original games, one would think that SAM would have some personality, since it would make Ryder more interesting as well by interactions between the two of them. I think that if they made SAM somewhat like Bagley from Watch Dogs: Legion, or Cortana from Halo, it would have made the story and the character of Ryder much more interesting. It was a poor decision not to give him any personality.
The story itself had a good premise, the Arks going missing, main character being forced by the circumstances to become a leader, and so on. The problem however is that it was not well written. The Kett unlike the Reapers were not that original, and the only part which could have been a somewhat interesting thing to explore about them - namely the fact that the Kett themselves were made of the species that they fought against - was not a major part of the story, even though it would have been interesting to explore the psychological effects of having to fight against your own allies who were captured and turned into the enemy (granted this story element was not that far removed from the Reaper indoctrination, and therefore was not new). It was mentioned, but quickly forgotten about. One other quite weird fact was that the missions to recover the lost Arks did not really matter to the respective species on the Tempest. One would think that recovering the Asari Ark would be the loyalty mission for Peebe, but no, it was the loyalty mission of Cora, and the reasoning was once again, that she was Asari commando. You would think that if the survival of your species in a new galaxy depended on saving a ship you would care about it, but neither Peebe, nor Vetra cared much about the Asari and Turian Arks, which made both of their characters unrealistic.
The fact that the Renegade/Paragon system was removed, made it possible to make somewhat more natural decisions, however it also came at the cost, that most of your decisions did not really matter, they did not change the outcome, or in fact any major part of the story, and it also accounted for the fact that Ryder could not really have any distinct character traits, since it would have excluded some of the dialogue options.
In conclusion I think that the concept of this game was quite good, but the execution was lacking substance in a lot of different ways. 
I recommend this game since the worlds which you can explore are beautiful, and the combat is fun, and visually entertaining, but only buy it on discount, and do not expect a game that is even remotely as good as the Mass Effect trilogy. If you want to experience what Mass Effect really is, than buy the Mass Effect Legendary edition instead, which is better in almost every possible way than Andromeda.",1629461140,1664054881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are small but gripping moments when the game shines and I see the vision what the developers were trying to achieve. One of those moments is when you're on mission in Asari Ark. You start to see the horror what happened inside the ship through many logs and the cold, vacuum atmosphere sinks in when you enter a room with a huge hole on the side of the spaceship and this makes the whole room sound muffled. During the fight, you start seeing parts of the office chair etc floating around and for a split second, you come back to your senses and remember that you need to shoot the bad guys. 

What I am trying to ramble here, I would even go so far and honestly say that this game is easily my second favorite in the series. I know, crazy talk. Okay, Mass Effect 2 is still my favorite and is prime example on how the team building side missions are as important as the main story and first game could easily be my second favorite - just for the plot, the wonderful ambient score and I still remember the first time when the end credits started to roll and first notes of Faunts' ""M4 Part II"" hit in my headphones. This is pure gaming nostalgia for me. But when you start thinking about the combat, empty planets in side missions - the paint starts to peel off and the design on old game doesn't feel that hot anymore after fifteen years later. The third game? F*ck that game with a rusty spoon. The ending with multiple choices whack-a-mole and therefore discarding the player choices in the trilogy really left a bad taste in my mouth. Didn't deliver what was promised.

Is Mass Effect: Andromeda perfect? No. And it doesn't need to be. Bugs, wonky running animation that looks like it was made by developers doing their first ever third person game or horrendous facial animations where some human characters almost have bell's palsy but to me the graphics doesn't dictate if the game is good or bad. It's the feeling of the game that is more important to me. And yeah, the main character doesn't have the charisma of Shepard and looks like average joe/jane at the best but that is the appeal of it. You're sibling of the pathfinder and right at the start you have big boots to fill when simultaneously you're pulled into these new worlds and you try to understand the big picture. Despite the flaws it carries, it's one those games where developers took risks to freshen up the franchise and the gameplay of Andromeda rise above of the trilogy because of that. Meaning the shooting and combat is more tight with included rocket jumping and you have a lot more toys to choose your play style and you can really mix it up if you really want to.

Get the game on sale, worth the time spent for the cost.  Just enjoy what is there, try to not think about what it could have been.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
 - The combat is great, the addition of the jump jets/biotic leaps are excellent.
 - The overall graphics are really nice, it gives the world some excellent details
 - No limit to the character you can build, 3 types of combat can be built at the same time.  Character build customization is excellent.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
 - No meaningful choices, you get the occasional decision to make, but they have no effect at all.
 - No squad customization whatsoever, gear or armor, even skins.  Mass Effect has been doing squad weapons and armor since the beginning,  ME2 started doing alternate skins, ME3 continued, but MEA said nope, not important.  We have all those research options to make armor and weapons for our own use ONLY.  What a wasted opportunity.
 - Due to limited choices, there is hardly any replayability in this game.  Since you can build all combat types at once, why roll a different type?  Just completely respec and build anew.
 - this has been beaten to death, animations are horrible on human faces, other races hide it better.

[h1]The Other[/h1]
 - Some things happening in the background that go on, right from the start of the game.  They don't matter, but never change from the moment you unlock the nexus until the end of the game.  The same groups of people standing around on the nexus complaining about stuff, on planets shaking hands.
 - you can have 100% completed a planet, and you still get triggers from the first quests in the game, ""Ryder, that body.  What happened.""  That is just poor, if the quest is resolved, stop the cues for them.  Ideally, remove the model of the body, or flag the voice over.

If you have never played it, it has great combat, a decent story, and good side characters. I know there was a lot of backlash with its initial release due to bug animations, etc. I don't recall having that many issues on ps4, and now playing it on pc, it plays pretty smoothly. The only pet peeve is that it does feel like the controls take some time getting used to them. I felt it was a lot faster to get used to playing with a ps4 controller. Maybe I'll play with a gamepad later, but I do want to get accustomed to the keyboard controls as it is more comfortable from a pc/long hours gaming standpoint. Also, some of the character designs do look a bit different than Mass Effect (1,2,3), but it didn't deter me from loving this game. I'd say you're better off just giving it a fair try without so much bias on what issues it had on release date, etc. Also, I wouldn't compare it 100% to the other mass effect series as it was made by a separate team.

-first the graphic were awesome (still looks good for me even though this game released in 2017).

-i dont know which part of the story that make this game looks bad, but so far i still enjoyed the storyline.
(i'm not finished this game yet , but tbh for the first 40% progress of the game , i found nothing wrong with it)

-i played the original trilogy before and when i found some conversation and some character (even tho just being referred to) that related with the original trilogy arc , its make me relieve because this game even tho not a direct sequel to the trilogy , but still part of the trilogy itself.

if you ever feel doubt to play this game , you were wrong , but if you stil dounting it , you should buy this game while on sale and try it yourself.

it just my opinion guys , but overall Andromeda its not bad as people says , but not perfect as we expected compared to the trilogy , but its a good game to play and its more like bonus EPISODE / Spin-off before the new mass effect trilogy (i hope so) continuation for me.",1663572435,1663572435,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However after playing the Mass Effect Legendary Edition I thought I'd give it a try. It certainly doesn't live up the original trilogy but I went in with lowered expectations and on that basis I thought it was an ok game. Flawed but it does have some enjoyable aspects.

I did actually quite like the concept of the game where you're playing as the first colonists from the Milky Way to arrive in Andromeda. It gives the story of this game a bit of independence from the trilogys story and some scope to build a new overarching story and setting. Plus the whole exploring a new frontier establishing  outposts thing is quite a good idea, as while it was cool exploring the Milky Way it lacked that true feeling of the unknown. The only letdown is that as the game is only set in a small corner of Andromeda and you only really encounter two new races, with one of those being the games bad guys. 

The crew you have in this game as also a bit of a mixed bag. I liked Drack the old Krogan and Jaal who is from one of the new races you meet. But then the Asari fangirl Cora or Liam who is just annoyingly positive are irritating. So the crew you get arent quite as memorable or iconic as say Garrus, Tali or Wrex from the original trilogy.

Combat has seen a big improvement and allows for more freedom in movement with an added jump pack and dodge move which makes combat feel more fluid, unlike the stiff restrictive combat from the previous games. I also liked the way you have more freedom to build your combat abilities and change classes on the fly instead of being restricted to one class. 

Where the game really struggles is the many uninteresting fetch quests and large mostly uninteresting maps. It seems like Bioware learned nothing from Dragon Age Inquisition, where they did something similar that ended in the game being bloated with loads of uninteresting side missions. In the old Mass Effect games I really enjoyed doing every side quest and optional content as they didn't go over the top with repetitive quests. In Andromeda I just reached a point where I couldnt be bothered and even then there was still loads to do. I'd recommend just trying to complete the main story and Ally quests without going overboard on the rest.

In many ways it feels like those things that people didnt like in Mass Effect 1 have sort of crept back in with Andromeda. At least with ME1 you could sort of forgive those flaws as it was a case of the series finding its feet. Andromeda doesnt have that excuse.

That said I hope they dont completely abandon the Andromeda side of the series as I think there is potential for the setting. Unfortunately given the slating the game got on release its probably unlikely.

Overall I think if you're a Mass Effect fan who can still tolerate playing Mass Effect 1 then maybe this might be worth a try if you can get it on sale. As long as you temper your expectations you might get some enjoyment from Andromeda.  If you've never played a Mass Effect game I'd just go with the Legendary Edition of the original trilogy instead of this..",1663460264,1663460264,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It turns out that there's a lot wrong with this game that seldom gets mentioned, and you encounter a lot of these problems in the tutorial when you're forming your first impressions. So let me just list some things off:

1) No manual saving during main quests. For large portions of the game, including the first couple hours, you're dependent on autosaves. Those autosaves happen immediately after combat, so if you die you have to redo any exploring or looting you did since the previous combat bit. You're most likely to be prevented from saving in intense areas where you're most likely to want to save a lot. I've heard this excused as an engine limitation, but Dragon Age: Inquisition uses the same engine and doesn't seem to have this problem.

2) The game never tells you how to heal, and it's not immediately intuitive. Health regen is limited. There are no healing abilities or consumables. To heal, you have to walk up to certain boxes marked with a particular symbol that doesn't intuitively communicate ""health."" They look similar to the ammo refill boxes, which are explained, so players can figure out the health boxes eventually, but likely not during the tutorial. So you can get stuck at 1/3 health in the tutorial with no knowledge of how to heal yourself and no ability to make a save closer to the battle that keeps killing you. Confusingly, there are some boxes lying around that look like the medigel boxes of the original trilogy, but these are just decorative.

3) The open worlds are empty. There's an unnecessarily huge amount of space between points of interest and it's not even pretty. Driving across all that space becomes a huge time drain. There are two different desert worlds, an arctic wasteland world, and an asteroid. The only pretty and interesting ones are the jungle world and the volcanic world, but you don't get to see the volcanic world until many hours in. 

4) Lastly, the writing and overall structure of the story have all kinds of problems. On the surface level, there's a lot that's phrased badly or just not thought through. On a deeper level, a lot of stuff doesn't fit together right. Characters talk about how important it is to build a home in Andromeda, and yet getting planets to 100% viability has no impact on anything because really this is a game about shooting Kett. You can repair the whole environment of the Angaran homeworld, but they still don't like that you're trying to live in the same GALAXY as them. I could ramble on forever about the writing issues, but I've spent enough time on this review.

Anyway, I finished the main story and most of the side quests just so I could say I finished it, but I regret how much time that ate up. So much filler. So much that feels like it was made by amateurs.",1663309342,1663309342,False,6,1,0.550059080123901367,0,True,False,False

ME:A is a worthwhile experience for both veterans and newcomers. It comes with its downsides sure:

-Bugs: Two instances where I reached a bug. First one was a failed save slot, had to go back about 30 minutes of game play. Second one was in the finale where killing one of the enemies didn't register the next event and had to redo the section (not really a hassle)
-Animations: Once in a while you'll encounter a t-pose.

But that's about the only downright negatives I can think of. I loved the characters in this game. Without having 3 full games to build their stories, each companion is lovable. The music isnt the OT OST, but it holds its own very well. I added the credits song to my personal playlist! Side missions are good time killers, with character quests being the best quests in the game IMO. The main story is captivating enough to keep you playing. Though sharing similar beats to the OT, it leaves you wanting more at the end, much like the first ME did. Combat is engaging, though at a certain point, like the previous games, you find the perfect combination of powers and the game becomes much easier.

The romantic options are all pretty good, though I pour one out to the m/m romancers. Allow me a quick rant. Gil as the only real gay option (Reyes and Jaal are bi, they get the same dialogue as female Ryder, nothing really different) is great, his character and motives are charming. Downright attractive at times. But there is a lot of issues present with Gil as a gay interest, *spoilers to Gil route* [spoiler] the fact that his best friend is forcing him to have a baby otherwise he is ""not a real man"" , putting you in a situation where you're kinda forced to both be fathers, or that some scenes were cut from the final product that involves Gil's romance scene, really rubs me the wrong way. You as Ryder don't really get a say about Jill. You can reject her proposal, but then you're left baby-less and the route with Gil feels weaker. [/spoiler] The women really don't compare to the OT women, with Vetra being a good contender. But again, the OT had 3 games to build up characters you could truly love. ME:A does a good job to get you invested in them all. If you play Female Ryder, you also get to romance Suvi. She's so lovable and honestly I wish they gave her more in the romance route.

Overall, I loved all 80+ hours I put into this game. Much like finishing the OT, this also left a hole in my heart after completion. It's not as big a gap as OT left, but ME will always be treasured to me, this game included.

Pros and Cons:
Pros:
- It's a good idea for a game.
- ....that's it for pros.

Cons:
Going to do this in prose rather than a list, as there's just too much to say.

I made it to 5 hours before I couldn't bear the characters any more. You play as a wet floppy celery-stick of a character who's daddy is apparently some big shot - though from what little we see of him he just seems like a reckless mid-life-crisis sort of guy.

You and your squad are apparently all greener than that celery stick I mentioned (and with about as much flavour) and approach their first arrival in a distant alien galaxy more like a school trip than a dangerous exploratory expedition. Reference is made to some military background or training, though there's absolutely zero evidence of that in the way anybody conducts themselves or interacts with each other.

You're told you're the first people from the Milky Way to arrive in this galaxy... apart from all the other people who arrived before you (so not actually the first in any sense of the word). Apparently nobody thought it was a good idea to send the ""pathfinders"" (the people responsible for all primary reconnaissance) out with the first arrivals, but instead to send them in later AFTER the main space station has been built out there. 'Cos, you know, if you're gonna go to a new galaxy its better to send your most essential asset (the Nexus) in blind, alone, and first.

They did have the bright idea to do some long range scans though, so they weren't totally blind. And naturally nobody thought to come up with a plan B if those scans turned out to be inaccurate, which of course they are... Or if the Ark ships couldn't rendezvous with the Nexus as intended, which of course they don't. I mean who could have predicted that attempting to reach a new galaxy for the first time ever wouldn't go exactly according to plan?!

I basically gave up after the moment when a Krogan told me that somebody had offended her clan and so they had left. The Krogan... walked away because somebody hurt their feelings? Fuck off.

The problem with having a game like Mass Effect 2, is how do you follow up? In fact Bioware did remarkably well with Mass Effect 3. Andromeda is neither 2 nor 3 - but those set an incredibly high bar. You're in a new galaxy - but you really can't tell.  There are dozens of planets, but all of them are cookie cutter versions of ice, desert, jungle, or moonscape.  Most of the missions are tedious, go to planet A, get a clue, go back the Nexus, speak to someone, go back to planet A for the next clue - rinse, repeat.

But then there is the crew, and this is where Andromeda hits a home run.  The monotony of the point A to point be nonsense is broken up by some of the best dialogue I've heard. PeeBee, the promiscuous Asari sexually tormenting Jaal, the repressed Angaran is hilarious. This isn't the Normandy and most of the crew really don't like each other. The car rides bring it all out with some stellar acting and clever, very adult writing,

Speaking of adult, much was made of the nudity. It's all hype. There is very little in the game. The combat is good and the AI is better than previous games. The powers mean much less than the prior games, but that's not a bad thing. But as with all things Andromeda, there isn't much variety. Three enemies  are all there are in the Andromeda galaxy. The story is good, but borrows heavily from previous themes.

I played as a male, but it makes no difference. As per usual, women are just men with boobs with no different abilities.  It's sad that there was no attempt to explore the feminine perspective. but our society is determined to erase women and womanhood.

It plays worse than the trilogy due to concessions to multiplayer
It looks worse than the trilogy because they replaced the beautiful skyboxes with models
The world is a lot less interesting since they essentially had to throw away 3 games worth of lore
And its a lot more buggy

Im still enjoying my time with it and I intend to finish it, but it doesnt measure up to the trilogy.
One thing i want to point out as a positive is the driving sections they obviously put a lot of work into. I liked those in ME1 and i like them here. It makes the planets feel more like real places. This sadly comes at the cost of a lot fewer linear segments. 
Overall it feels like a modern AAA game which means, there is a lot of stuff to like here but it feel somewhat soulless.

I played Andromeda before ME1-3 and I just finished NG+ insanity playthrough and I haven't played anything that good and involving. I have to specify here, because I just wanted something to be like ME3, but better, with more action, better gunplay and fun. Yeah. It has huge problems if you are comparing whole game with origin and there is a reasons why story feels weak even in general without coming back to...ya know. The way how story progress is also bad, because concept is just repeatable and filled up with a bunch of kinda different side quests that don't really give us options and hard decisions to make.
All best part and greatness of Mass Effect Andromeda is hidden behind its OG+""something fresh"" RPG system, crafting and utilization of old concept of how weapons and mods were working. Disposal of abilities, weapons, mods, armors and ways to handle every combat in game got to such high level that makes Mass Effect 3 remastered feels like it's actually old game and, unfortunately, never were good at gun-play.
Another good part especially for low price of the game is that how it looks and it looks so good even for 2022. I swear. Well, don't look on how characters look like, thx to modern ""communities"".

if you have played the other games in the series you might like this game or you might not for me the game is a bit buggy but i still played and play it like i said i think they were trying something new but a lot of my choices didnt really matter in this game i think thats what bugged me the most i dont want to spoil it for you but it doesnt really matter who you let out of cryo there isnt a lot of plot points that really matter so it kind of feels like im not achieving anything when i play the game im afraid to say by comparison of the other games like even the tiniest detail could mean that you get more or less war score depending on how you played and the choices you make in this one its like i dont really care if im nice to so and so because it has no long lasting impact on the story there isnt really any hard choices to make is my main beef with it like the other games it really did matter.

however its not fair to compare this game to the others i did still have fun and getting my head around the new systems was a struggle at first but i got there i think they should bring back team mate powers that you control and go back to having 6 powers instead of 3 i felt very limited in what i could do and i just had to hope that my AI companions did the right thing during combat (they didn't by the way) all in all i like a lot of the new stuff in the game as well as some of the expansion of the lore if you want to find out about that stuff on your own instead of watching youtubers then id say buy it or if you just want to support the creators then do so.

For the Developers
[spoiler] I think you guys did a good job with this game as a whole but please take the time to properly iron out the bugs i know deadlines and time constraints and shareholders may not like to help you out with testing the game much maybe even allow beta testing from loyal players and such.
Crafting
i think your crafting system was actually quite cool once i got my head around how to use it and where to go to get certain resources.
Combat
i think your combat has had a massive improvement very fluid much more free to zip around and attack the enemy i like the combat and the ease of taking cover was also a nice touch like i said up top just add more powers to my wheel to use not just the three or let me control my team mates maybe i could control my team mates but i didnt notice where i could control and use their powers.

Space travel and scanning system
these systems are always evolving and they have been getting made to look better and better and easier to do i thank you for the much less time consuming version of the scanning system instead of guessing when you got all the minerals or not this is the year whatever it is and we have advanced alien tech now like sesh.

Choices
i have to say this was probably the most disappointing aspect of it for me the lack of choices and the amount those choices mattered i know it was probably all planned to matter but you guys just ran out of time to make the game or maybe some of your creators got pulled off the job considering the voice acting was like you must choose carefully who you let out of cryo first and then it was just for like on going bonuses like i could let all the super useful merchants out first and then basically have zero like actual defences on those colonies it was like if i was the Kett id just annihilate a mostly trading and science mission which didn't wake up any of its military.

Story
the storyline was a lot better then what i thought it was going to be but again it just kind of changed into well i dont really care about the outcome of my choices because the game is a lot more linear regardless always a pretty good turn out whether you choose to be liked by the people or the people in charge of the project it has very little consequences and makes no difference other then dialogue.

all in all it kind of just feels rushed but your other games a massive master pieces thanks [/spoiler]",1662350314,1662350314,True,0,0,0.497028946876525879,0,True,False,False

You will play as human Pathfinder Ryder, his/hers goal is to find new home for humans (and other allied races) in Andromeda Galaxy. You can visit over 100 planets, solve mysteries of ancient Remnant race, befriend new Angaran allies and fight against Kett threat. Story is good but it lacks plot twists and choices could have bigger impact. Main quests are interesting, companion quests are nice but tasks are pretty boring. Gameplay is enjoyable. Shooting is fun, there are enough weapons & armors to keep you entertained. Exploring is satisfying, I like solving remnant puzzles & detective minigames (scanning for leads) especially. Character developement is too simple for my liking. You don't allocate atribute points, you only pick active & passive abilities. I don't like that there are over 100 planets but you can explore ONLY SEVEN worlds... why make so many when >95% is unavailable? The game is pretty repetitive, shooting & exploring is fun but how many enemies can you kill before you get tired of it? I wish you could support colonists (more meaningful side quests & activities), build some structures (you collect so many resources along the way but you only craft weapons, armors and augments), do some espionage activities (and weaken Kett activity in the sector) etc. Another issue is difficulty level... ME Andromeda is too easy! I didn't have any trouble in random encounters and boss fights were pretty easy too but took longer to beat. Even though I've installed few fixes I still encountered bugs and glitches.
Graphics looks very good! Some planets are lovely (Kadara, Havarl!), others are just ok but none of them is ugly ;) Most characters looks nice and sounds good. Unfortunately most weapons sounds lame.
Overall, Mass Effect Andromeda is pretty good and enjoyable aRPG. You should give it a try if you like casual aRPG and you're not afraid of shooting hundreds of enemies ;)

PS. I've played with lots of mods for better experience and I advice you to do the same!

It is its own journey, and I doubt the developers will pick it up in the future, considering the difficulties it had at the start, and the relative letdown towards the end of its story. Looking forward to coming back to the Milky Way in the sequel of the series, not of Andromeda itself.

The story elements that changed made the game its own version of Mass Effect. The Krogan aren't as uniformly violent, but the complete 180 to less rough, guttural voiced characters, and the incredibly disappointing melee cutscene (not fixed to date) completely break the tone of these icons of dino brutality. It makes sense to have inventive Krogan, but scientists, geologists and even gene-altering botanists, outside of pro-shaman reformed Tuchanka? This is madness. 
* There weren't any major changes to the Salarians or Turians however. The Angara are cool, just wish their planets could be accessed with your Nomad, and that there would have been more; more of the Angara, more of other alien lifeforms. Not a single leftover of even Primitive life left a gaping hole in the sense of exploration, Kett be damned and all that. The only other independent outpost of Andromeda colonists you meet are on Eos, and only vaguely appear during an optional story quest; they supposedly exist off-map, and you can either threaten or amicably sign a trade deal, with further diplomacy on the horizon. No Turian colony, no Salarian colony. You're supposed to accept them mingling amicably on the Citadel-clone, which is itself relatively small. At least the Citadel had its own intrigues.

Crafting is a bit of a ""meh"", your Farmville mechanics are too weak and require you to keep your game running in order to benefit from them in any way; and by the time you could use resources, you could invest into at least one piece of fun/useful equipment (and most of it comes from adventuring - like around 80%). Research points are scarce in this sense, considering how far you can level (and each level of equipment needs more). 
* The replayability factor from this leaves a sour burnout. Despite all of this, the equipment you find in the world can be enough to beat the game. I don't remember having a difficulty setting, haven't played recently before leaving this review, don't intend to do so in the future either.

Party controls are irrelevant. You're the team in this one, much like you could be in ME 3 (at least in ME 3 you could coordinate throwing nades, shockwaves or mass effect fields). Only relevant to get your party bants and reactions to your apparent speeding in the massive world sections of the game. Rather self-explanatory, as you can't change party character equipment, and only really get to influence their skill output somewhat. Most driving sections are quite enjoyable, in particular towards the end; my first time getting there felt thrilling.

No upgrades for your crew's stealth-escort craft. No weapons either. It should've followed a different design to the Normandy, but the same stolen stealth technology. Or a completely different approach entirely; downsizing is not different if the damn shape is the heckin same. Understandable from a story pov, considering the limitations of resources. What is not understandable is the lack of any firepower or its presentation. 

Multiplayer felt like another ""meh"" to me. I joined in a couple of times, and only met a high level player and some other lost soul like me. The High level player triggered more difficult NPCs, turning the event into a chore. Do not recommend unless you intend to grind with friends, while exploring possible shenanigans.

-This is a continuation of the Mass Effect universe which you probably shouldn't miss given what's likely to be in the next game.
-The combat system is a clear step-up, i.e. it's mechanically quite a bit more robust.
-For the most part, I *did* have fun playing this.

As for the negatives:

-The story feels like a MAJOR drag at many points. Some parts feel worthwhile but the pacing is completely lost at multiple points in the story.
-The dialogue is bad, like REALLY bad, for 90% of the game. For some reason they seem to be trying super-hard to make it funny, but it falls flat on its face and casts the story as a lame shadow of the trilogy that came before it.
-I don't know how to fully explain this, but there's something about the story that just feels unfinished. The point of no return in previous entries were super-consequential and felt like an awesome climax to the story, but in Andromeda it was kind of a snore fest except for a few good moments where the stakes felt high.
-Faces and facial animations are hilariously janky.
-The protagonist, Ryder, is a total dweeb who can barely be looked at as a main character. People would never have disrespected Shephard the way they disrespect Ryder in dialogue.

It has fun combat, looks gorgeous, and it thrives on the major missions (such as those in the main story and loyalty missions for your squadmates) where most of the writing keeps you hooked. But with some of the design choices and the plague of bugs, I just can't recommend this game. 

First off, this game absolutely did not have to be open world. The 100-ish hour playtime you see? The majority is from the mindless padding introduced in these open world environments, which are pretty monotone and boring to begin with. The side quests get very repetitive very quick and it feels like they're designed to waste your time. Having only a few explorable planets also means having to constantly backtrack between environments you've already visited. Like I said, the game thrives on the linear set-piece main story stuff, just like the Mass Effect trilogy did, but the open world stuff definitely put a sour taste in my mouth.

And second, the bugs and dialogue issues. These frustrated me to no end. Infinite load screens, quest markers that don't disappear, and a ton of other minor things. But the main culprit is how ambient dialogue is handled; there were too many times where some really interesting dialogue just cuts off because I drove or walked two feet, never to be heard again unless I reload a save. Another dialogue issue is one of chronology and pacing; imagine spending time dismantling an enemy base and then hours later hearing ""hey, there's a new enemy base"" when it's the same one you took down hours ago, or NPCs referencing an event that hasn't happened yet. The game doesn't seem to know how to pace itself, and it really suffers for it. 

This game did some cool things, like taking us to a new galaxy and coming up with a pretty interesting story, making combat pretty fun, and doing away with the paragon/renegade system to instead introduce casual/professional/logical/emotional dialogue responses to shape the personality of your character. But at the end of the day, I felt frustrated with how much of my time was wasted with the boring open world design and the frustrating bugs and dialogue issues.",1661871232,1661874519,False,10,0,0.543055951595306396,0,True,False,False

Pros-
*The combat can be fun, there is some healthy diversity in weapons and abilities but not leap and bounds more than the previous games.
*The dialogue can be good at times, but I found it to be 60/40 for the most part.
*Visually the game is alright, but it's nothing outstanding given the year and version of the game.
*The story is alright, if not overly drawn out. I'm not sure if it's because of my experience with games in general, or if the story is a bit weak; but I was able to predict almost every plot point, twist, and even the ending (along with the 'memory' side quest).

Cons-
*Although the combat can be fun, the severe lack of enemy diversity makes it repetitive. Different worlds having the same animals was probably one of the worst smacks in the face I got early on, it felt cheap and lazy. Outside the animals, you can expect to fight 3 factions total; Outlaws, Remnant, and Kett. The Remnant are the only interesting enemies, but the fun factor runs out quickly.
*The dialogue as mentioned before, is a 60/40 for me with the 40 being utterly cringe worthy dialogue that's either nonsense upon hearing it, or terribly voice acted. 
*Bugs are still insanely common, map markers don't appear for quests, objectives for some quests legitimately bugged out for me that made it impossible to complete them. (Despite the bug being well known).
*This game released during the open world phase of video games and it shows, lots of busy work with little impact on a larger scale. If at all.
*Choices are often unpleasant for the wrong reasons, I know that taking the 'grey' route is too easy for a lot of people and so the developers like to stay away from those kind of things to make people consider the choices more. However, the game will throw a choice at you sometimes that's just outright dumb to do EITHER of the presented choices. Minor spoiler warning for a side-quest that ultimately does nothing- A perfect example of this is on Kadara (btw, fuck this planet and the requirement to load into the port, then down to the Slums, then needing to run out of the Slums in order to fast travel) where you're forced to choose between two doctors on who gets a addictive medicine; who you have 0 idea is actually good because the other claims they're crooked and shit. So instead of just removing the medicine entirely from play, you HAVE to give it to one of them.
*Animations.. oh god the animations, the run cycle is absolutely one of the worst things I've seen in a 'big' game, and if it just visually looked bad, that's one thing... but you actually control like a street bike trying to take a sharp turn, leaning over at an almost 45 degree angle. The facial animations got barely improved from launch.


Ultimately this game felt as though it was made in a year using unfamiliar tools and a confused development team that was thrown into a fire then told to 'Do the Bioware magic'..... oh wait, that's exactly what happened. Only the magic was more akin to a clown balloon trick.",1661844299,1661844299,False,4,1,0.526213705539703369,0,True,False,False

I'll start by saying the graphics were actually very good for 2017. The facial expressions were indeed horrible and looked like nightmare fuel at times but if you can get past that the game itself truly looks beautiful. The skyboxes and combat effects were very well done, the combo detonations looked awesome and sounded just as good. Some abilities were a bit lackluster but you can't have everything be epic as that's just unreasonable. I did have about 10-15 hard freezes over my 100 hours of gameplay where I had to use the task manager to close the game which was frustrating. The autosave function was good until it wasn’t; There were a few fights where you reached a point where you should have checkpoints and if you died you would have to go back about 10 full minutes of combat which was just tedious.

The combat was very much improved from the original trilogy and you can essentially morph abilities to create a build you specifically like. You can only have 3 active abilities at once which I disliked, I personally preferred when you could have 8 abilities on your quick bar but I understand why it was done this way. It would be a little bit broken if you could cast 8 abilities at once nuking everything in sight. You can make up to 4 *favorite* profiles which you can swap in combat but again each profile only has 3 abilities at once. The enemy AI was good and the bosses felt like real bosses (on insanity difficulty). The friendly AI was among the worst I've ever seen. I saw my companions stand still and do nothing numerous times throughout the game and on occasion get me killed as I would dash into them while they were standing still.

The storyline was decent enough. I enjoyed it and thought it was executed well but there was a bit more to be desired in the primary antagonist. He was a cliché villain who explained his plan a few times which made me not care for him. The enemy faction isn't a complete disappointment although, as there was a mission in particular that showed their atrocities which made me despise them (which is a good sign for the story). 

My biggest gripe with this game is the simple fact that your choices do not matter in the slightest. There are so many moments (probably about 100 unironically) where you come across a choice you think might be significant only for NOTHING to happen after you make the choice. I understand this could have been Bioware setting up forward choices in a sequel but there were less than 10 choices that actually had any impact. This is totally unacceptable in my opinion as Mass Effect was always a series where your choices matter and you have positive or negative consequences.

Multiplayer was alright, I didn’t care much for it but it seemed pointlessly grindy and there were *some* microtransactions which don’t really affect you too much, they just unlock other spec/characters.

Overall I give the game an 8/10 and that is generous. It's closer to a 7 but anything that I can enjoy for 100 hours deserves that extra love.

To keep it brief and wipe my hands of this experience as soon as possible, this is essentially the most soulless, generic sci-fi game imaginable, lathered in a thin layer of Mass Effect iconography. The story is bland and forgettable, and the same can be said of essentially all of the characters, which once upon a time were the cornerstone of Mass Effect games. There's no incentive to care about anything that happens or form attachments to anybody when it all feels rolled off a production line, which certainly isn't helped by flat dialogue and a lack of atmosphere throughout. Gameplay is relatively solid, and the one redeeming quality the game has is the level of customisation it offers in terms of playstyle, but otherwise it's just padded out with a load of useless secondary mechanics and systems I never had need of using. Design is no better than the rest of it, levels are repetitive and uninspired, and even with two or three exceptions, the various locations aren't particularly exciting either. Side content is just as uninteresting, and past a certain point I gave up on it entirely; just so I could power through the main story and be done with it. Thankfully at the very least it was a largely bug-free experience, but there are of course lingering issues with the technical side of the game such as its half-baked animation and unresponsive controls. Can't say I'll be rushing to play this again... ever...

So what kind of game is this? It’s an open world game where you do missions to help make planets a habitable place by making the environment less harsh and taking out the bad guys. The game takes place across several different galaxies where you can visit (only) a handful of planets. The planets are very different and varying in sizes. If you have an itch after watching the movie Interstellar and want to travel in space and visit cool looking planets, then this game can offer just that :)

There are a lot of things to do in this game, side missions can keep you busy for +50 hours for sure. I found myself doing a lot of them because most of them were fun and felt meaningful. But mostly because they were so fleshed out that it never felt like a useless “fetch” quest.

You can scavenge minerals and materials to research & develop space suits and weapons, and you always have 2 crew members fighting along side with you on all missions. In some way, I will miss the characters in the game, after almost 100 h playing, they left an impression :)

Regarding the negative stuff, I did not experience anything that frustrated me. I had a few crashes in the beginning, but once I reduced the overclock on my ram & cpu, the game never crashed again. The random info about temperature and atmosphere was cool (check my uploaded screenshots), but it was disappointing that they did not at least provide a small picture which showed the surface of the planet. Would be cool to see lava flowing or just storms as it is mentioned in the info :,) 

Oh one important thing, I highly recommend not to touch the eyes during customization of your characters. The game seems to have difficulty dealing with facial expressions. In fact, probably best not to mess around too much with the face customization, or your character will ruin many cut scenes with unnatural face/eye expressions.",1661128906,1661128906,True,8,1,0.576467275619506836,3,True,False,False

I’ve tried to force myself to play, quit and return many times but after 25 hours, I finally gave up and rushed through the rest of the main story to complete. Here’s my thoughts:


Pros:
+ The weapons and abilities actually feel quite good to handle.
+ They also improved the journal, but why use sub-menu instead of tab?
+ Some of the side mission, such as the Ryder Family Secrets, Peebee, Cora, Liam’s personal quests or Finding the missing Arks, are really well-done, until someone decided to hide them behind tons of unskippable cutscenes and loads of busy work.


Cons:
- The combat is fine. But in an attempt to merge traditional cover-based TPS with fast-paced FPS, Bioware ultimately lost the soul of the series. You can no longer use tactical pause to freely command your squad or customize their loadout. Moreover, the combat pacing is so frantic that most enemy will charge you right away instead of taking cover, therefore renders cover worthless and encourages a more agile playstyle. 
This one isn’t what I’m looking for from a studio like Bioware, who has a long history with tactical real-time RPGs.

- I’m tired of seeing the same generic, procedurally-generated open world, which is then filled with plethora of repetitive activities that contribute nothing to the story. Mass Effect 3 and Deus Ex: Human Revolution were both made in 2011, and the two “coincidentally” have some of the best open hubs in gaming history. 
If you don’t know how to make a great open-world, please stick to what you do best.

- Bugs and glitches can be fixed, but terrible wrtiting is irremediable. Let’s make a small comparison to another RPG, which is also made in 18 months, Fallout New Vegas. The game came out a buggy mess, but with the combined effort of the passionate modding community, it eventually became a polished masterpiece. Where is Bioware’s equivalence, you ask? The answer is no one has enough strength or resource to fix a game where everthing that makes the series special in the first place, is broken to its core. 

The casts, with the exception of Drack and Vetra, are the exclusive members of the juvenile club, who constantly throw unfunny jokes in your face and always try to make the dumbest decisions known by humankind. And don’t make me talk about the main plot because I remember nothing outside of ""evil alien race who didn't forget to remind you how evil they are by kidnapping people and stealing their genetic material or something"" (basically a boring Reaper rip-off).

The script was written, the story was told, the scene was acted, this is truly the game of all time.

- More adventures in Mass Effect universe
- There is appearance/skills respec station available just after prologue, so you can fix your haircut or add a fancy scar after you had your helmet bashed in, for memory.
- No class system. You have to pick a starter class, but it doesn't do anything later on, you are free to pick and mix all of the weapon/biotic/tech powers.

Negatives
- Crashing. All. The. Time. - By the time you finish the campagin, you will swear at DirectX error. Save often.
- Performance drops in cutscene dialogues. You play easily with stable 60+ fps, then you get a cutscene where literally nothing is happening, and it tanks to under 1 fps. Its literally a talking head and the guy doesn't even have hair. What are you rendering, his atoms? Also crashes at this moments. Save often.
- Online is broken. Broken, as it works, if, you call the hindu tech support, get transferred four times, spend a week and maybe it will start working then. Remember to mention that ""no, you don't have origin access, ea play, xbox game pass, or playstation plus, youre playing on steam"". Otherwise the tech will run like a headless chicken.  There are some players in multi still, but often no one joins your matches. 
- Online cnt: Oh, and the stupid 'waiting on you' claxon starts blaring when you're in character customization screen, even if you are the only person in lobby, but you can't see it, because it doesn't show it, and you accidentally start a gold challenge solo. Splendid design.
- Online cnt.cnt: The Single Player APEX system will not work until you fix your online. So yeah, to get those achievements you have to get the online fixed, even if you never play with other people ever.
- No infinite ammo mechanics - remember how ME1 lore explained that with the fancy mass fields you no longer need ammo, because you shoot a sandgrains and rifle has a whole pound of them inside? That was a Good Thing. But of course they had to break that and add ammo system, so now you have to run around the map to find ammo box in middle of fight. There are weapons with overheat mechanics, but you have to research alien weapons or special augment to get them. There is absolutely no reason why everyone runs with said alien weapons in MP, we have plenty time to get out of cover and restock our ammo, yes?
- Powers with use limit. - Remember grenades from ME1? So now you get powers (as in multiple) with 1-4 charges. They have no discernible damage bonus (if any at all) compared to other powers, but will make you run around the battlefield to find ammo boxes, because you have nothing else to do. So my suggestion: avoid them.
- UNSKIPPABLE TRAVEL. What a deranged idiot designed a system where quests send you on a trip to seven planets in a row, but you have no way to skip the travel sequence? Going to another system? Half minute ftl animation. Landing on a planet? Another half minute landing animation. Want to get off the planet? Please sit waiting like an idiot while we play the takeoff animation, because its inconcievable anyone would not want to watch it for hundreth time, and people in 2018 or whenever this game is from have not heard of SSD drives yet. Oh, and there is fancy ""flying to another planet within same system"" animation, but this one you can thankfully skip after first 5-10 seconds.
- Alt+F4 closes the game. What use does this serve? Hide the game from your boss? Its not like you are going to play this at work. There is no 'save before close' prompt, just bam, game exits. Its not very nice in a game that uses both ALT and F4 as default keybinding for stuff.
- Surprise nudity. Spoiler: There is a surprise scene where you visit your coworkers to talk, only to find them fully nude, with the sensitive bits obscured by well placed desk, and strike a conversation. It was a true WTF moment. Come on, I know its marked pg16, but thats a bit over the top for some sensitive folks out there. There should be a 'nudity' filter in the game options. There are also scenes where mammary glands are shown, but those happen when you're romancing, so at least you do expect to see something then.

So yeah, if you want more mass effect adventures/lore, feel free to get this. If you get irritated by technical issues, crashes, and dumb waiting, go get some game where devs actually cares about player experience? KOTOR 1/2 or any new SW titles are fun, and you still get to throw things around.",1660932724,1661006526,False,3,1,0.518836736679077148,0,True,False,False

Different galaxy, different crew, old and new races, new allies, new enemies.
If you haven't played the Mass Effect Trilogy (Legendary Edition), do that first. Although storywise not an absolute prerequisite, you wil understand a lot of things better.
A lot of the following is a comparison with the Mass Effect Trilogy (Legendary Edition):
You will spend more time on planets in wide landscapes as well as in smaller living areas (when you progressed you will have fast travel points on the planet surface, to keep travels short). The landscapes are very pretty, very different and have unique properties, like heat, cold, radiation, aggressive wild life, all of which has an impact on you. You're given a new rover ""Nomad"" (much better than the rover you had im ME1 and 2) which you can upgrade over time. Combat is a bit different than in ME3. After a short time of getting used to it, it's even better. The Tempest (your ship) is a bit larger than the Normandy, more stretched out horizontally than vertically, with really nice design. One of the best things: You have big windows at the bridge, in your quarters and another important room, that actually show what you would see in the location you're currently at. The characters are great again (including the voice actors), though they are IMHO not as deep as in the trilogy. The interaction with them is very similar to the trilogy, with one improvement: What you say is marked with an icon, suggesting in what direction that answer goes, like logical, casual, friendship, ...
Main story line: Pretty good, less deep and philosophical compared with the trilogy (which is totally fine), with a less controversial ending. Your choices through the game matter. If you don't completely ef it up you should have a pretty nice ending.

What could be better:
- Although there are no unnerving mini games for opening doors, there's still some mining ore stuff, players could have lived without, i.e. mining ore by exploring with your rover a bit similar to the graph analysis stuff when ming ore on a planet in the trilogy. They should have better left out. It's no fun and just annoying.
- Two of the Nexus leaders can be pretty annoying, almost like a politician, and you can't punch them in the face, no matter how much they deserve it. ;)
- Character look generation: Concerning when the game came out it could have been better already. A little detail: It's very imortant that a characters ""neutral expression"" is actually neutralIy or all animations on top might look off, which is the case for some choices. I hope the upcoming ME4/5 eleveate that part a bit more.
- Facial animations: ... lip synching (at least in English, can't talk about other languages) is very good, but what""s lacking is a nice representation of the characters feeling when they talk according to a) what the say, b) the mood they are in, c) the relationship they have with the person they are talking to. That's my biggest negative point with this game.
- research (reasearch point based + player level dependent), development, crafting with very many options ... they made it way to complicated there
- changing your weapon and armor: possible only in very few places and the menu structure is quite uncomfortable (and it's not explained, so you have to experiment to get it). As this changed in every game, I hope they spend some research time on this before/during the development of ME 4/5 instead of ""getting it wrong"" once again.
- multiplayer: the usual multiplayer game issues, i.e. if you want to play a mission there are not necessarily the necessary amount of people there. Skills vary, people may leave mid game, difficulty is not easily assessed before a game, how you can change your equipment is quite difficult to access, especially when you are directly before starting a mission. Really bad menu structure. ... Good news: You can enjoy the game in single player mode without touching multiplayer a single time, without missing anything.

[hr][/hr]

If you are a ME fan, I would recommend you play this game with an ME1 mindset. The main campaign is basically a world-building exercise. The main villain comes off as a watered-down Saren Arterius and his motivations take a while to be revealed, making the story feel weak compared to the ME1+2+3 story. This is really part 1 of a series.

The best missions in the game are actually the companion missions, which reward skill unlocks, and the outpost missions. Without spoiling anything, I would recommend you play the main campaign missions until the companion and outpost missions become available, complete them, then progress through the campaign missions and loop. Do not skip the ""Ryder Family Secrets"" mission, as this is the main connective tissue back to the original ME and has some juicy story bits.

The combat is better than ME3. There are more skills and gear (at least 5 armor sets and a lot of weapons that can either be crafted or purchased) that can be mixed and matched to fit your build and playstyle. I played a ""paladin"" using a Biotic shield skill to reflect attacks, a Krogan hammer for my melee weapon, and a shotgun. It was a lot of fun.

I saw some complaints about backtracking. There are fast travel points in the open world and hub areas, which makes this a non-issue. I would highly recommend you purchase the upgrades for your Nomad, as they make your driving around a lot of fun.",1660614869,1660614869,True,33,0,0.660039901733398438,0,True,False,False

I already played it back around the time it was released, and after experiencing the original trilogy I was still jonesing for more.  That was a mistake.  ESPECIALLY coming directly from the original trilogy.  This game is absolutely heartbreaking and I literally feel saddened when I think of the incredibly talented people that poured their lives into this for years only to see this lump of clay explode in the kiln.

In its defense, it easily has the best feeling combat of the ME games.  However, everything else (and I truly do mean everything else) is either horrendous or just half-baked enough so that you can see the potential that was wasted.  Worst of all though is the characters, which stands in stark contrast to the stellar and iconic characters of the original trilogy and the largest reason for why that series made enough money to allow this travesty to have a ride on its coat tails.

I want to make this abundantly clear:  these characters are not just bad comparatively.  They are some of the worst I've ever seen.  No one is memorable, and if they are its because they're annoying.  The only character I remember by name is Peebee, which is likely the closest they got to an interesting character.  Everyone else is flat, vapid, and boring.

To cap things off, you barely even qualify as the main character, as most of the time you're just doing what you're told and looking like an awkward idiot while you fumble through it while other wooden characters do the things.  The entire Andromeda Initiative is so poorly planned and loosely maintained that it strains credulity as a premise for this game.  The people are so lacking in discipline and ability that it would have made better sense to depict them as exiles or accidentally in Andromeda because of the Reapers or something.  As it is, it seems they would have completely starved and died off without the great Protagonist to save them.  It's pathetic.

You want fun combat?  If you can muscle through hours of slow and tedious gameplay that amounts to interactive cutscenes, you can then find some pretty great combat in here.  I'd recommend looking elsewhere though.  It's a great looking game, but I think a good analogy would be slapping a Lamborghini's body around a Pinto.

This game had a lot of interesting things to explore, a good story, and I really enjoyed the combat dynamics. While there wasn't really much stealth to speak of, the combat had fun opportunities to use different powers and combine them into combos, level up your companions' different skills and deploy them where you need them. 

The visuals are pretty impressive, especially the vaults. The story is interesting  - you can help unravel a galactic mystery here, and the dynamic between the Andromeda races felt fresh and novel to me.

Despite this, I didn't personally find this game immersive and never lost myself in it. Also, it wasn't clear what impact my choices had on the story, but from early on it did appear to be limited. 

The next part of this review deals with spoilers in terms of how many endings there are and what impact choices have on the story (but I left out most details.)

[spoiler]
Ryder fulfills his/her role as Pathfinder, and doesn't have the opportunity to deviate from it or get involved in factions in a significant way. I read in a review that this may be because MA: Andromeda is intended to be the starting point for a number of other games/other media. There is only one ending, and the choices made by Ryder have only a minor impact on how that ending plays out. 

Ryder makes several choices during the game - which cryo pods to activate, whether to designate a settlement military or scientific, which leader to back - which will have a fairly minimal impact. I would have liked to  have had a bigger impact on shaping the ending, though I get that that might be impractical if this is to be the starting point for other games.
[/spoiler]

The major drawback to this game for me was the number of bugs. I encountered several different bugs during playthrough and some of them affected multiple saves and affected Priority (main story) quests. With affected saves, I was able to go back through my saves until I found one that worked. 

This game has a romance component with the companions; I think there are a few interesting choices to romance, but none of the male romanceable characters were appealing to me.

Despite this, I did have a fun time with this game and would recommend it for the interesting story and fun combat. Beyond just combat I really enjoyed the motion of the characters - jumping and grabbing in the exosuit armor is really satisfying! There are a couple of good combat consumables, but not so many that it got complicated to use them. Some people don't like the favorites wheel; it personally worked great for me, maybe because I pause to switch weapons, etc., a lot during combat anyway rather than using hotkeys.",1660372304,1660372531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

but....
I've never been so disappointed in a game ending, and yes, I'm considering the Mass Effect 3 original ending.
I kept pushing through the story waiting to play my twin, only to find out, you NEVER do. Except for a few seconds.
I've played RPGs since the 90s, and this is the first game I ever stopped doing side quests. I finished the game at lvl 57 but my character was basically unchanged since lvl 30. And the gear is boring. Just every 10 levels, craft a new set. By lvl 20 you're never short of money or resources.
They go to an entirely new galaxy, and there are only 2 alien races there....where's the wonder? Where's the magical sense of exploration and discovering new races and cultures that was in Mass Effect 1. I'd say there were 3 interesting components, but 2 where utterly undeveloped.
Not only do you have less crew than in other Mass Effects, only half of them are interesting. And honestly, 3 of the non playable crew I wanted to boot off my ship.
Yes, you can have fun playing. But don't expect to be wowed.
The music is REALLY good at the end though.
I tried really hard to enjoy this game. I gave up once before, then started again and pushed through the first part and it started to get interesting.

You get these little reminders of the original trilogy, like recordings of Liara talking about archaeology, how Salarians treat Krogan, and a few familiar weapons. You're in a whole new galaxy, with a whole new dynamic, including female Krogan and Turians, Asari with faces all the same (melted off in cryo?) and some weird new aliens (but nothing better than a Thresher-Maw). You can say 'but it's all different, and mechanics are missing!' and be right: there's a few (like the old cover mechanics) that are changed.

If you're craving more, this is it. I would suggest waiting for a sale if you're still concerned about the quality and stability. I paid $8 and i'm sure there are many sales for this game. 

I put 72 hours and enjoyed all of it, and loved some of it. The story and characters are pretty good, but not on the same level as the trilogy. That's with this whole game, but that's expected and is no reason to avoid this game. Drack is by far my favorite character and I believe he would've fit perfectly in Shepards squad. The enemy doesn't compare to the reapers, and was a little eh at first, but towards the end it fit well with the stakes of the game and the Initiatives goals. It kept me motivated to see the game to the end. To keep this short, the writing is decent, but believable. The plot is generic like majority of games, even good ones, it's just about what is between the beginning and the end that truly matters and its solid. Characters are interesting along with this new galaxy and its inhabitants. Lacking on the amount of intelligent organic life. Angarans and Kett, that's it with a synthetic alien life known as the remnents. Alien animal life lacks too but that's just a side effect of short development time. Overall, solid enough.

The gameplay is the highlight. It's extremely fun and smooth and a very nice upgrade over the trilogy. A lot more mobility, awesome new biotic and tech powers to use. The only issue is the enemy variety is bad. Most encounters are the same, but is still enjoyable. There are very few instances where you'll be caught off guard with a unique enemy. The game has its quirks, but so did the trilogy. Goofy or awkward animations, some characters head turn like a robot, the goofy facial animations. Nothing happened too much but was very noticeable. The game does look very good, even 5 years later. The players ship is awesome, probably even a cooler design than the normandy. There is a lot of content in this game surprisingly. Is it all insanely creative and unique? No, and some of it is just too much. Traveling between systems and even planets is slow and annoying. They hide loading screens with cool scenes that keep you immersed, but gives this weird slow feeling that's hard to express. So towards the end of the game I stopped doing everything and focused on a few loyalty missions and then the main plot. I left a lot unfinished. 

TL:DR
Worth getting when on sale, very solid gameplay but lacking in enemy variety. Decent story with decent writing, but doesn't compare to the trilogy. Very pretty and stable game from my experience.

People are way to stuck into nostalgia of what ""Mass Effect"" really is. I played all the originals at the time of release. I've read books and comics. Which is far more than most people ever have. I love the universe they created. So keep that in mind for what comes next.

I played probably 1 hour when Andromeda first released. I dropped it. I can't remember why.

So back 2022. I got the legendary edition of Mass Effect a while back just to remeniss on old memories. Enjoy what I thought was going to be fantastic. I started Mass Effect 1. My god did it show its age despite the recent polish. Got into Mass Effect 2 and started playing. But I was curious at that point. How was Mass Effect Andromeda now and how does it compare. I tried it for 1-2 hours or so. Christ. I had to force myself to finish Mass Effect 2 and 3 after that point. If we could have superimposed ME1-2-3 without the visual glitches on ME:A with the modern combat. Dear lord.

Once done with the legendary edition of Mass Effect it was time to pick up Andromeda again. The storytelling is good. It looks fantastic. The combat is on another level and massively enjoyable. It has lots of visual nays unfortunately. Bioware never fixed it (remember all the goofy faces on characters at launch). It is what happens when game studios abandon games. If they did a no mans sky on this game, christ, it would be a 10/10. I could nitpick on all the dumb things that  shouldn't be in the game but there's no point. You look past it and it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.

Highly recommended and its a good scifi story set in the mass effect universe far detached from the originals. It is really really good! I'll never play ME:L again. But I will do a new game plus of this eventually which speaks for itself.",1659559789,1659559789,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After playing several other games and completing everything the original trilogy, this game is the personification of the phrase "" A mile wide but an inch deep"". Bioware really dropped the ball here with a very bland enemy, forgettable storyline and a world of filler content. All of these complaints are before I even get to the bugs that have been there since release which stop you completing quests, stupid facial glitches and when you play on Insanity difficulty the enemies aren't difficult they just bum-rush you. The bosses such as the cardinal aren't difficult either just have bullet sponge mechanics to the point where I used all of the ammo in the boss arena and barely got hurt yet she was still alive.

Let me first tell you that I am a HUGE fan of the first Mass Effect series. In my eyes it was the best series of games I have ever played. I really enjoy the Mass Effect universe, its races and lore. 
But it took me forever to try out this game for 2 reasons:
1)  the reviews of ME Andromeda were so bad that I hesitated for a long time to buy it.
2) I was so horribly disappointed about the ending in ME3 that I tended to believe the reviewers thinking they had messed up again with this one.
But boy, am I glad that I took the risk and played ME Andromeda. I truly enjoyed it and cannot see at all why the reviews  have been so bad. True, 5 years after release lots of problems that existed at that time seem to have been resolved so I cannot judge how impossible to play the initial version was. 
But honestly, the game didn't lack anything. The story was great and epic, the characters (the crew) were a lot of fun, the missions were diverse enough. And there were quite a few details to discover and quite a few fun scenes.
Many people seem to complain about the lack of decisions, but I think there were quite a few. Should they ever continue the Andromeda series I can imagine quite a few decisions affecting the story. After all, if you had only played ME1 you coudln't have expected how your decisions in the first game affected the second (and even third) part.
A lot of criticism was about the player not being able to skip landing scenes on planets or traveling from one system to another. Yes, I admit that is a bit annoying and I would probably have finished the game in 135 instead of 135.5 hours. But let's be honest. This is in no way enough to make the game bad and give it a thumbs down. I think lots of people just hate EA and thus judge their games too harshly. I am not an EA fan either but I still try to remain objective and this game was awesome.
One thing I could criticize is that sometimes things happen that they made up and make no sense, and the ending seemed a bit deus-ex-machina like, but oh well... I can easily swallow that.
I really hope they will continue the Andromeda series although it seems the chances for that are slim :-(",1659383797,1659383900,True,21,0,0.668016195297241211,0,True,False,False

[b] Overall score: 3/10 [/b]
It's simply a boring game.


[b] Choices: 1/10 [/b]
Your choices DO NOT matter. I've played 40+ hours of Andromeda (because Im a masochist, and was hoping there might actually be interesting choices/sidequests [there's maybe one or two good sidequests in the entire game]). In all that time I've only faced one choice that felt like it mattered or had significance at the time, and the repurcussions of that choice went as far as one companion being a little mad at me. That's it. I can't even be an asshole or get rid of companions, nor will they leave me despite me killing their friends. It really felt like all the dialogue choices, all the quest choices, all the choices I made just don't matter. Which is ridiculous for a Mass Effect game.

[b] Gameplay: 4/10 [/b]
This game had a lot of potential, but sadly it squanders it.
It's still fun if you stick to the main missions, but my god 90% of the side quests are repetitive fetch/kill quests. Go to the 4 corners of this huge empty map, and get these 4 crates of medicine/beacon/datapad/generic fetch quest items. Fight these same enemies on every planet in their copy/pasted bases. There's A LOT to do in this game, but most of it is the same quests over and over again, making it very repetitive. Combat feels better than the original M-E games, but the lack of diversity in enemies/situations means it quickly gets boring.

[b] Exploration: 3/10 [/b]
The developers bragged about its dozens of worlds, and yes, there technically are dozens of worlds. But you can't actually interact with most of them. There are maybe 4/5 real planets/maps you can visit,  and even those maps are repetitive, filled with the same quests. They made the maps quite large, but then forgot to fill it with anything. And yes, maybe that's realistic for a new desolate alien world, but having an empty boring map doesn't work when you're trying to make a video game. It honestly just didn't feel worth it to explore. There's nothing interesting or cool to find. What really busts my balls is when they space quests out over multiple maps and planets just to waste time, because obviously we as players love travelling to multiple maps and sitting through unskippable cutscenes just for some generic sidequests.

[b] Story: 2/10 [/b]
Story is trash. Absolute trash. Generic evil aliens want to kill/convert everything, but luckily another race of ancient aliens left their super advanced tech everywhere to help you fight them off. A handful of good moments wasn't enough to save this terrible story. There were a few interesting plothooks that are deliberately left unsolved, presumably to use in future games, but all that does is leave the game's questlines feeling unfinished and unsatisfying.

[b] Characters: 3/10 [/b]
Characters are painfully two dimensional. God forbid characters every stray or grow beyond their specific archetype.

[b] Dialogue: 3/10 [/b]
Poorly written dialogue. Everyone talks like what a bunch of 40 year old men think edgy teenagers sound like.

[b] Graphics: 6/10 [/b]
They eventually patched the graphics, so now it looks ok, but it's still not great.

[b] Bugs: 3/10 [/b]
This game has been out years, and still suffers from bugs. Screen glitches. Questlines bug. NPCs aren't where they are meant to be. Characters/Vehicles getting stuck in terrain. Fast travel bugging out and not letting you travel (which is very frustrating when combined with the character trapped in terrain bug).

Pro
All in all the gameplay is way more fluent, especially the fighting. In the old version I often felt clonky and like a rock that is moving, especially when sitting in cover. This has been overworked and in my opinion to the better. It feels like a modern game should feel.
Graphics are amazing and at least on my PC the performance seems to be quite good optimized.
I am not through yet, but I already like the story. It is separated from ME3, here and thre are nice litle references though. 
Conversations with your team mates are like before, very entertaining and also the chatter between your group members is often funny.
The integrated a new mechanic to create your own armor, weapon and mods. For that you need research point that you get by scanning new devices, building etc. This motivates to explore the world and benefits players like me, that discover every corner. 
Maps/Worlds are way bigger and look fantastastic, you also get again a vehicle which is very fun to drive. 

Negative
Unfortunately you can't change the appearance of them, that is a step backwards. You own gear can be changed, color too.
There is no renegade system, you have choices that matter but no indications in form of a point system. To me that is ok as it is more realistic. In ME3 some choices did not fit into the black/white system. Also, you let your choices not be influenced by their category that way.

3. Your not a military god in this, but your role is still vital, just in a different sense. E.g your not a N7 spectre anymore, your a pathfinder.
Which is exploration, first contact, and threats, etc etc.
 Graphically stunning game.
SFX are great.
Combat gameplay is fantastic, it is better then the other mass effects, still don’t treat this as a mass effect game, forget the word when playing this.
Story is ok, it can get boring, you might skip dialogue.
Trick to this game is just do the main quests and don’t worry about every small detail if your finding it tedious.

Go in, fresh slate, Star Trek style.  Good for a chill out mindless bit of a adventure, with awsome combat and a lot of character builds.

The game isn’t bad, it’s got a lot of great things there, it’s just dwarfed by the trilogy before it, which had a more serious, more consequential impact on choic, and a far more rich and dense story.

My friends, it's actually pretty good.

Mass Effect is more than just Shepard, it's a deep foundation of lore that any number of games could build upon. I think this was an excellent Mass Effect game, despite it's flaws. Ryder especially is relatable, a far cry from the often polarizing Paragon or Renegade. 
I don't see how this crew could be considered ""forgettable."" I loved each and every one of them, which is generally often not the case in games like this. They all had valid skill sets to bring, and bright personalities to fill the hull of the Tempest.

The story is good, but kinda all over the place. It's not quite as simple as ""We need to stop Saren/The Collectors/The Reapers"". There are a lot of things going on and a lot of things that are weighing on your shoulders: Find the colonists a home. Understand ancient alien technology. Fight a war against the Kett (aka The Reapers Lite). Build relationships with new aliens and other factions. The best parts of the game are the loyalty missions where the game goes back to it's roots for a more linear level with scripted events and an emphasis on character development. The open world is mostly empty and needlessly vast. My least favorite thing has to be that your team just doesn't get along. Everybody hates somebody, and it's just lame. On the Normandy there were some rivalries and sure nobody really liked Jack but thats because she wanted it that way. On the Tempest it's just passive aggressiveness constantly. Everybody thinks they're better than everyone else and shouldn't have to put up with anyone else's shit. It's exhausted to play mom/dad to a bunch of adults, while also not really being respected by the rest of your team until you really prove yourself.

Can definitely recommend this game! Once this is done, I will hit the Remastered trilogy!

Edit (after playing ME Trilogy) ... oh boy! I now see why the old fans didn't like Andromeda. The characters in the ME Trilogy are much more professional (except for the Citadel DLC, which feels like it was taken out of a Marvel comic / movie) and Shepard is such an awesome character. But comparing Andromeda to the Shepard saga is setting it up for failure. Taken as a separate title in itself, Andromeda is still an enjoyable game with good combat, more movement and generally larger game worlds (this is also made possible by the technology which was available for MEA but not for the original trilogy).

Before this year, I had never so much as seen anything on the mass effect universe. Then a good friend got me to buy Legendary Edition which I thoroughly enjoyed. Then against his advice, I set out to play this game, with him playing ahead of me. He, (a true mass effect fan) absolutely hates this game but not because its a terrible game, because there was so much potential (as well as the minor gripes: unskipable ship travelling cutscenes, animation glitches, etc). He didn't like the story, saw it as boring; he did like the crewmates though, that's one part we can both agree on.

I on the other hand view this experience much like Mafia 3. Both games came out quite near eachother, both suffer from the open world game syndrome of collectable and traveling back and forth across the map for no good reason other than to finish a minor sidequest. I hated almost every hour of Mafia 3, but for some reason I really like Andromeda.

The gameplay is definitely the strongest out of all the Mass Effect games. Many people complain about only being able to use 3 powers at a time, and going into it I was unhappy with how speciality ammo was changed from the previous games. But as I played, I found both of these to be actually pretty good changes. I probably shouldn't have played the previous 3 games without using any powers (cryoammoforlife), but Andromeda pushed me to use the tech and biotic powers. I hated the combat roll from ME2 and ME3 mostly because it kept ruining my movement, but the power dash and jump/jetpack in Andromeda was an amazing system that I used constantly.

The guns were wide in their variety and all felt different, albeit they did feel weak, requiring just a *little* too long to kill something holding down the mouse. Even lv5+ guns felt like this which was unfortunate (except the Reegar shotgun, that was just based).

The research system wasn't terrible like my friend said, but I wouldn't say it was amazing either. Maybe it was intentional, but it was not possible to get a maxed out set of gear from one of the three tech sections playing through the game. Making, modifying gear was admittedly a fun experience; however it definitely felt limiting at points, especially when you just don't have enough tech points to upgrade the weapon you really like.

The story; oh boy this one my friend and others really didn't like. Controversial opinion, I thought it was solid enough. Clique sure. Bad? No. Was the main villain a bit weak, yes. Andromeda kept my interested through the whole playtime, I was invested in my decisions even though they didn't change much in the grand scheme of things (I suspect a trilogy was planned but got canned due to the horseshit launch). The squadmate side missions were all quite solid, other big sidequests were interesting, albiet perhaps dragged you around the maps a bit much. For the most part, sidequests gotten on a planet could be completed without any loading screens, the issue lies in the ones that couldn't.

Loading screens, god damn. The developers designed a beautiful looking starship, a magnificent vessel the Tempest. But then you don't get to look at it in transit at all. Going between systems and the cluster uses a first person cutscene like those racing games where the camera is right infront of the bumper. Like I want to watch this beautiful model fly through the stars, why are you doing this to me. Next, going onto or leaving planets as well as travelling between system cutscenes are unskippable; why? The game only takes a short while to load but you have to watch the full animation every time; and its the same animation without any changes. Normally I wouldn't complain about watching the ship I just complained about not seeing at all. But when you get the quests that drag you between loading screens repeatedly it get very annoying, and can turn a 20 minute quest where you have to travel through the screens into a 30 minute one. Between planets you have a manual skip button which should have really just been a toggle or solid loading screen.

I only encountered one major glitch where I died while a squadmate was talking and it corrupted the save file. This happened a few times, and with no fix you are required to load back further and further until you find a file that works.

I like Andromeda, its a shame that there's no chance in hell EA and Bioware are going to give it a sequel. I feel that if they just had more time they could have ironed out most of the technical and gameplay issues as well as giving the story the higher degree of attention it deserved to make it great.

Is Andromeda as good as the first 3? No. However, it is still worth playing!

The gameplay is a lot different from the original games, you have more manoeuvrability thanks to your jet booster and you can switch builds on the fly. This means you aren't limited to just soldier, tech or biotic abilities. Your Ryder can be a jack of all trades and (if you have enough skill points) master of them all too. The game has also adopted the ""open world"" style that Dragon Age Inquisition used, where you have lots of tasks to do on open world maps.

What i just described above is what i believe to be a lot of ME fans problem with this game, it strays a bit too far from the ME formula and closer to a Ubisoft style game. I personally enjoyed the combat changes as it helped this game stand out from the first 3 and is enjoyable in its own right. It's the second point that I agree, holds this game back; The open world and abundance of quests. The biggest problem this game has is how I’d describe the overall experience in one word.

[b] Bloated [/b]

There are far too many menial side quests and some require hopping from planet to planet, backtracking and having to sit through all the same loading screens disguised as cutscenes of the ship taking off, flying to a new system, landing etc. It gets tedious to say the least. Had the game been more like the first games where each quest takes you to a new location? This game would have been better received. Although the dreadful facial animations of its initial release doomed it to being memed into oblivion (The facial animations were improved btw). I doubt i'll ever replay this game because of this, unlike the OG games that I've replayed MANY times.

but I was pleasantly surprised to find I actually really liked the crew of the Tempest, and once you get past all the memeable faces and dialogue of the opening hours, the crew actually starts to shine and provide the most interesting quests in the game. Jaal being a standout and my recommendation as a party mainstay because of how personal the conflict in the game is to him and his race. Had some of these crewmates been in the OG games, I think some of them could have been fan favourites.

The main story however, isn't as interesting. It has some good set pieces (particularly towards the end) but I doubt the story is going to have you on the edge of your seat with twists and while the game does have a few moments where you have to make tough decisions, i never found myself pining over them like i did in the first 3 games. None of the choices you have to make in this game feel on the same level as, say, Virmire in the first game and because it's unlikely this game is going to get a direct sequel, some choices made in this game have nothing to carry over into.

That said, I enjoyed my time with this game. I feel like it could have had a large chunk of playtime cut off it if you got rid of the rubbish sidequests and just stuck with the more interesting ones involving companions and planetary leaders. The gameplay is good and fluid, the crew is interesting once you start to get to know them and had this game not had the issues I laid out? Could've been a good first attempt at continuing the Mass Effect series without affecting the original trilogy.

ME Andromeda has a lot to offer. The story is solid, the dialogues are well written, it has a ton of content (in the beginning it was even a bit too much and kind of overwhelming for me) and the combat mechanics are great. The new Jetpack brings literally a whole new dimension to the game. But there are two things that stand out to me. You really have the feeling to explore a new galaxy, they did a great job on that. You really are a pathfinder who discovers new worlds and tries to find a new home for thousands of people. And I absolutely love the quest design. You have to make tough descisions all the time and the game doesn't take you by the hand with that. There is now paragon or renegade playstyle because it's barely ever clear what is the good or bad thing to do, just like in real life. I absofreakinglutly love that.

1. Not as good as the original trilogy in terms of story but still enjoyable. Still prefer the Geth over the Kett anytime. The Angaran also didn't feel as unique as the other races (Krogan / Male Turian was just so cool).
2. Scanning planets is fun at first but gets tedious, same with mining.
3. Companions were useless (they deal silly damage) unless modded. 
4. Equipment UI is not so friendly at comparing weapons, Had to research weapons that actually perform worse than a weapon I found, thus wasting precious and limited Research Points. 
5. There's still bug where you can get stuck and had to reload earlier saves (DON'T GO TO THE RAMP NEAR THE NOMAD INSIDE THE TEMPEST).

THE GOOD:
1. CORA
2. Ghost Assault Rifle + Turbocharge = Space Rambo
3. Liam has the best companion quest LOL.
4. NPCs not as broken during release.
5. Moddable.
6. Friendly hardware spec but graphic and gameplay didn't feel outdated (played on high setting with gen 4 i5 and RX 470).

Score: 7.5/10
Great games to get during sale. a good RPG experience.

The game's combat system is absolutely a HUGE improvement from the trilogy, with you being able to move freely (like jump around and dash/dodge around), and experiment with different abilities that can most likely match with your play style and give you an edge in different situations especially in harder difficulties.

Some say the story is bad or boring but I believe otherwise. If you take your time talking with characters in the game, get to know your crew, and play the game without hurry, you get to appreciate the relationships you build, and your very character. 

I am thankful that the developers of the game have fixed a lot of bugs unlike from the release (from what I have seen on YouTube reviews), there are still some things that need polishing like conversations getting cut out, and again some bugs that still remain.

Let me address some of the most common complaints I saw before I decided the game is worth a shot.
1.Voice acting is horrible- This one I don't understand at all, all the voice acting was average at the very least with a lot of it being above average for me. This is cherry picked as the game has many voiced characters and the majority are pretty solid.

2. Facial animations are trash- Yeah they are not what you'd expect from a 2017 game, but it's what you'd expect from a 2015 game, my point? They are not unbearable, it's easy to just not pay attention to them, another nit pick.

3.Item interface is horrible- Yep, this one I completely agree on, in fact I only used 1 armor set and 3 weapons throughout the whole game, heck more like 2 weapons. I'm a simple man. All the items you can get feel like they have little impact on the game, I Switched from kett armor to remenant, I did not feel any tankier, my shield regenerated just as fast, and that 40% damage loss I Should've had was not there. I also never used the crafting system, you get next to no special bonuses, nothing worth your time of collecting resources at any rate.

4. Story is bad- This one I completely disagree on, from the moment I started the game to about 60 hours in I Was completely immersed into the world, I actually felt like I was the path finder and I can't wait to see what happens next. 9/10 only reason not perfect is because it has too many clif hangers and unfinished story bits.

5. Choices almost never matter-  yes they don't, but did they ever matter? look back on mass effect series and tell me how many of your choices actually matter? A lot of them you will say because they carry over to the next games, right? And andromeda's choices carry over to next games right? Well we don't know that

6. The world is big and full of nothing- Cmpletely disagree, I'd spend about 1 minute in my nomand before I'd stumble across an objective 9 out of 10 times, I think the balance between long distances to travel and objectives on the map is well met.

7. Space exploration is unsatisfying and dissappointing: I think so as well, but in the same time it does not have to be anything special, I have yet to see a game where you can interestingly explore a galaxy or solar system, There are some cool images you can get from the planet angles but that's about it.

I think that's about it, now let me point out some pros of the game that people tend to generally agree on:
-Good combat definitely solid 8, annoying cover mechanic though, melee feels very unsatisfying.
-Good visuals probably the strongest point of the game
-Good sound.
P.S I never played the previous mass effect games, and probably never will, waiting for the remastered versions. I also wish we got more of Alec, he is very cool.

This game is actually very good. And recieved a lot of bad attention when it came out.
SOME of this was very much deserved.
But to say that the game is shit, was a bit much.
First off, the game itself is fun. The exploration, scanning things, the graphics, combat, and terrain and moving along that terrain... its all done quite well and is very beautiful.
The onlyine play is a good side note, and fun, and the armor and weaposn look really good.
Combat is intuitive and fun.

HOWEVER,
The dropped th ball hard on the animations, and on the character customization to the point that it can honestly ruin MANY parts of the game.
The animations are not motion capture. So the cut scenes look jilty, very robotic, its just awful.
The eyes and face expressions and skin textures are abysmal in cutscenes.
its just NOT the quality of mass effect in customization or animation.
lastly, the women in Mass Effect Andromeda are absolutely NOT attractive. They have very bland personalities. And the romance options are extremely lacking. Its been this way ever since inquisition.
Bioware needs to step up the beautification of romancable NPC's, or allow for personal customization.

If I was to give this a review I would give it a 7
Its got a great story.
The exploration is fun.
The combat is good.
The in game graphics are great.

The cut scenes are robotic and scary looking.

After having read so many bu**-hurt reviews of people expecting to play ME4 with this, I went in hoping I wouldn't see a bad game that followed an amazing trilogy, hoped to have some fun exploring a whole new galaxy and looked forward to fun banter and gorgeous graphics. I got so much more.

Following after the trilogy is hard, and any game in this franchise would have hit a massive wall of negativity from people who simply want the trilogy to continue. But Andromeda gave us so much - it gave us a really well thought-out story that genuinely perplexed me at times, kept me thoroughly hooked throughout the whole game, and had me gasping in shock more than once. The little tidbits of Milky Way lore were absolutely delightful, the crew and companions banter was ON PAR, and the worlds were a wonder to visit, explore and see. 

There were, of course, things I would have liked to change - the constant ""fetch"" quests were a bit repetitive, but nothing one can't handle, and it would have been great if we'd had a little more of each world to explore and see.

I thought its hopeless and I wrote off that game and forgot about it. But after some time I gave Andromeda the chance and I really like it. It still have some small issues and a bit of wasted potential but it was fun experience and as fan of Mass Effect series I recommend that game. 

What I liked:
-RPG elements, clever profiles feature
-Exploration feels great
-Gameplay and platforming elements 
-Colonising planets and making them habitable is great 
What was mech to me:
-Crew was okay, most of the time nothing stands out about them
-Crafting was okay before half of the game I found armor that I liked and I wore it for the rest of the game
What I dont like:
-Graphics was good, aliens look good and even I saw effort and most of the bugs about animations fixed and still humans characters looked sometimes really off and some of them had really unplesant design

-Whole new galaxy could have more alien races",1657484539,1657484539,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

How do we solve it? Well, the community has a ton of mods that can make your experience easier and enyoyable, but if you like to play games in vanilla mode, you will need patience.

My relation with the game was kinda OK at some points, but damn i have to stop playing several times or my brain would have gone wrong. Almost 160 hrs into it just for the sake of complete it 100% in-game.

Why that much compared to the trilogy? 
Well because it has many side quests and repetitive exploring, dialogues, combats, enemies and underpowered capacity of releasing full power from the list of powers of every character, you and weapons (Jeez).

Sadly the devs decided to make this game boring and longer in a unnecessary way. I took my risks playing at it was released and patched for respect for the saga and my dear Commander Shepard. Hopefully will be having a better product in the next months o years.

Willing to play it? = Go ahead, give a try, you will have fifty-fifty. Get on sale the complete edition and for the DLCs, well ignore them.

Mass Effect: Andromeda is a enjoyable game that is let down by bugs, poor design choices, overly complicated interface designs and EAs incessant need to ""try"" and jam loot boxes into the game (which failed in the end..they're now dished out freely on a timer with certain missions). 

If you're a fan of the original trilogy, then yes. the game is worth giving a go, especially if you can pick it up on sale with 75% off. But go in with the mindset that there's a lot of nonsense bolted on to the game. Some quests have you skipping from planet just to talk to a single NPC then moving onto the next planet to repeat the same thing. All of this is fluffed out with the same cut scenes repeating over and over that you cant skip. 

The sad part is, the story inst bad and opens all sorts of possibilities  for more Mass Effect games. It was just ruined by EA doing what EA repeatedly does these days. Rushing broken games out whilst trying to cash grab.

Something that was similar in some aspects but different in many others. If you think of this game as a the 4th installment of the Mass Effect series then you have already set yourself up for disappointment. I look at this game as a game that's set in the Mass Effect Universe but is an entirely different game.

In Mass Effect Andromeda, you play as Ryder (Scott who's male or Sarah who's female but you can change the name on your Ryder if you decide to so), and you join the Pathfinder team to search for a new home in a new galaxy. Without spoiling too much, you will help Humanity (+other races) to thrive and survive in the Andromeda system.

I LOVE this Mass Effect Trilogy. With Andromeda, there is a different kind of love (and i'm not just talking about the many different options in romance, though I wish you could romance Cora as a female but whatever Bioware, just ----block me like you did in Dragon Age Inquisition with Cassandra and the Female Inquisitor, but I digress). I loved learning, and relearning the different things from Mass Effect Andromeda. Again without spoiling, there are puzzles to solve, places to learn and love, people to help, crew to grow close to, and so much more.

The interrupt system isn't the same as paragon or renegade like in the trilogy. Its a singular interrupt system. [spoiler] For example, when you travel to your (technically) second golden world, you meet an asari. You have an interrupt to push her off you after she tackles you. If you don't do it, it doesn't change much but some interrupts later in game are more game changing. That's all I'm gonna say about that [/spoiler]

Minor Spoiler [spoiler]Also in this game you don't drive a M35 Mako. The vehicle of choice is called the Nomad. It handles, in my opinion, worse than the Mako. I liked the Mako and how it was driven in Mass Effect 1.[/spoiler]

Mass Effect Andromeda is a whole different game though they sprinkle in things from the previous games and of course include some of the other races from previous games.",1656931488,1656931488,True,1,1,0.502868056297302246,0,True,False,False

If you put Mass Effect in front of me, I will play it. There are things I liked, and things I didn't, and understanding this up front will strongly  influence if you finish this game.

What I liked:
- Some of the crew, specifically Drack, PeeBee, SAM, Cora and Kallo
- The Tempest
- The setting; the concept of why they were there in Andromeda was really cool.
- Gameplay, the series has never been better in terms of combat. Flows well, fun, lots of strategy.
- The vehicle and your ability to customize it
- Game is absolutely gorgeous, beautiful graphics
- Game is genuinely funny at times
- Lots of worlds to explore
- Crafting and armor system
- Galaxy map 

What I didn't like:
- Liam, good god this character was awful.
- The Kett: Extremely uninspired, boring, uninteresting. I have ZERO interest in this enemy returning. NONE.
- Bioware, where did the narration of codecs go? Bring it back.
- While the setting was great, the overall story was almost nonexistent. I liked some of the sidequests, specifically family secrets.
- Those loyalty missions were largely poor and uninteresting
- The checkpoint system was poor, particularly if you are playing on Insanity. 
- I like long games, but this overstayed its welcome by 40 hours at least. 
- They fixed a lot of the bugs, but still ran into a ton of issues
- The dialogue camera is poor and pulls away from the discussions. Make it fixed like the original. The dynamic camera did not work well
- The turians and asari look really bad. 
- The voice acting at times was absolutely horrible. Not up to bioware quality. 
- They did not do enough with the Nexus, so many cool paths they couldve gone down. In the old games you had so many people and quests to do to build the lore, all you got at the nexus was cheap dialogue and poor sidequests. They really missed a big opportunity here. 
- The music score did not meet the quality of its predecessors 

Overall:
- If you are a Mass Effect fan, play it. Enjoy the combat, but dont get invested in the main story. Its not great. Play through the larger sidequests, skip all the tasks. This game has peaks and valleys in terms of quality, you will notice extremely good sections and cobbled sections. This game was rushed. If you skip this game, you wont miss anything. If you play this game, you just get more lore in the universe which is my justification for playing it. I would confidently give this a 6/10. Less bugs , more stuff to do on the nexus and better loyalty missions couldve made this an 8. Its really unfortunately this came out the way it did. really missed a huge opportunity. I actually originally gave this a 7 but lowered when I saw all my issues listed out. Get it together Bioware!

One slight issue i have with the game, and its an obvious one: It requires Origin to even play it. While that may be my first complaint, its not the only one, as the origin client itself is fine for its use, which is basically launcher for the game, it miffs me to no avail about how it will just refuse to launch the game at random times. [b]I have had situations where i'll wake up, play the game for 2 hours before i have to go to other stuff, close the game, come back an hour later, it will refuse to start up normally and will only work after a reboot of my PC. Then it will work, i'll play a bit, close it, come back, it will work normally that time. Then i'll play a bit more, close it down, come back later, and it wont launch anymore until i reboot the system. Kinda annoying, having to restart your PC just to get a game to start up.[/b]

Second gripe: [b]Online functionality doesnt work.[/b] Like, at all. Just tells me i dont have access to online functions and i should check a help link that does absolutely nothing to help with the problem. You contact EA support to explain the situation, you tell them you followed the instructions on the link the game gave you with the error, they will say ""I understand the situation, try this:"" and they send you the same link you told them you followed before. Not being able to access the online mode cuts out a small part of the game, which really shouldnt be happening if you ask me. 

I mean, all in all, its a good game, if you dont mind the launch problems, online functionality being broken yet required to play a certain part of the game, and the fact that you have to use the origin launcher at all despite the game being sold on steam. Aside from those problems, its a solid game, but the problems really shouldnt be there, let alone when the problems have been present from day the game was released.",1656870279,1656870279,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat loop is really fun and allowing the player to swap between play styles as they please by giving the option to switch what their ""Pathfinder Profile"" is, is a nice touch.

The sound design, visuals and special effects of this game are incredible too. best thing is, along with sounding badass, the abilities actually work very well on Hardcore difficulty and below and combo-ing together abilities makes them even stronger.

Now, my main gripe with this game is the awkward facial animations at times and how spaced out the dialogue is in quite a few conversations. Some of the enemies on Insanity are a bit too bullet spongey for my liking too, makes the combat feel slightly repetitive.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this game if you like the Mass Effect games/lore or want a good space RPG experience.

Beta quality, yet 1.10 version number.

Full of noticeable and irritating bugs. Honestly, this game shouldn't have been released even as it stands now, never mind years ago.

Save game limit without warning they've stopped actually saving (save icon still pops up), and no instructions on error or how to fix -- you can only save so many times, before you need to delete old saves (or open the folder and move them to a local backup folder on your computer).

Okay story, just passable (still filled with plot holes). Poor character writing. Poor character development.

SJW cringe. Lots of swearing. Lots of whining.

I don't mind swearing, but excessive and unnatural/inappropriate/unnecessary use makes it obvious that the writing is so bad, they have to plump it up with 'edgy' swearing amongst supposedly professional people leading a desperate group of colonists looking for guidance and leadership, with their lives in the balance.

SJW whining and writing, reminding you of broody teenagers and insufferable PC university students on a gender studies course. 'Rainbow' topics thrown in, in a garish and frankly disgusting way. I'm a gay man, and I found it almost nauseating.

Crappy animations. Ugly characters.

Nice scenery. Weird ship designs. Annoying transitions. Annoying space navigation.

Combat is okay. Driving is okay.

Imperial measurements aplenty -- seems weird, with some metric even being used, too. There's no way imperial measurements would be used so far in the future. I don't recall seeing imperial measurements in the ME Trilogy.

Side quests repetitive. Main quests repetitive. Lots of boring time. Open world attempt not a bonus... more linearity is needed.

I eventually changed the difficulty to easiest, just to get the game over with. I only powered through the game for as long as I did because I didn't have to work.

CONCLUSION: Mildly diverting game, only worth £5-10 due to serious bugs and lack of quality assurance. I can't recommend this game unless you have time to waste on a mediocre story with mindless shooting, annoying sudoku, and a vaguely Mass Effect feel... along with putting up with bugs and crappy animation, and SJW cringe writing along with characters that have no soul and plenty of foul language.

The game definitely deserved a lot of the criticism it got, but I suppose it's not completely *terrible* like some people claimed... but it's not good or great, it's poor bordering on passable.",1656826299,1656826299,False,2,0,0.525179862976074219,0,True,False,False

Let me start off by saying this is more of a Loving Rant by a Mass Effect fanboy than an Honest-to-God Review.
I was majorly skeptical of this game at it's initial launch. I wasn't a major Mass Effect fan, in fact, I hadn't ever played through ME until Legendary Edition released. I dipped my toes into 2 and 3 years ago when I first started using Steam as a platform, but I just didn't understand their appeal.

[b][u][i]Mild Spoilers lay Beyond, mostly Character related[/i][/u][/b]

But my God, this is easily one of the best Action RPG franchises out there and I am truly devastated that Bioware was bogged down with bug and game support to ever release the, ahem, [b]QUARIAN ARK DLC[/b].
Okay, I get many feel that Bioware probably didn't see any real reason to release a major Expansion with little to no margin for real profit with all the launch issues and instability, but I really wish we had gotten something about the major Epilogue stinger that the Quarians, Elcor, Hanar, Drell, Volus, and Batarians are stranded somewhere, somehow, for some--[i]why[/i]...?

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2735346959

The Beginning of the game was pretty slow, there's no getting around that fact. It stoppered my willingness to play the game [b]FOR YEARS[/b]. However, after I decided to give Shepard's story a full, [strike]very[/strike] [strike]mostly[/strike] fulfilling mega-playthrough, I gained a better and healthier perspective for the Mass Effect Universe and it's inhabitants. I really got it wrong about Andromeda.
Well, at the least the world- err, rather [i]Worlds[/i], Bioware was constructing, I still think the AC Unity launch debacle was tame compared to my experience at launch on the Xbox version.

Let's get to the good, GREAT, and downright unacceptably humorous about this game.
I love it. I feel like that should've been the first thing I said, but here we are. Everything about this game suffered because of it's Early game, but once you start building your crew past Liam and Cora, explore past Eos and Voeld, the game opens up to what you actually expect from a Mass Effect story.
The companions are fun, their interactions are memorable, they have depth that I couldn't find on their initial impressions. Hell, I almost felt as though I experienced some kind of Whiplash part way through Vault Hunting when I realized I was enjoying the banter and relationships I was forming with these initially flat, single sentence character sheet characters.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2827859911

The people you meet along the way, the friends you make, and the family you find are, in fact, not comparable to the Crew of the Normandy. Especially since none of the romantic arcs, at least in my opinion, come close to being as beautiful and fulfilling as Ms. vas Normandy herself Tali'Zorah nar Rayya. God I miss the Quarians.

But the Tempest crew feels more....[b][i]dynamic[/i][/b]. More Alive. Almost as if one can learn from their experiences and change on the journey instead of through written exposition on datapads and the time between game releases.

At this point, I'd probably say something about the main Enemies, the challenges you face, the Gameplay even.
I don't want to. I possibly garnered more enjoyment because the only thing about this game that I knew for a fact was Andromeda, not Shepard, new crew, new engine, and new gameplay mechanics.
If you enjoyed Mass Effect for it's world building and character interactions, then this title is no different and I highly recommend you play it.
Main Story missions will take you ~20-ish hours, but the rest of the game will take you significantly longer at ~60 or more hours. To me, I feel as though the ""Priority Ops"" were no more important or substantial than the Additional Tasks and Loyalty Missions you completed along the way until the Game's Ending and Epilogue. This is a new Galaxy, with new Aliens, Peoples, and Challenges to face and overcome.

The only knock I will give this game, over half a decade later, is it's Epilogue, not it's Ending. Refer to beginning of Review.

I decided to give it another chance in 2021/2022 and I can say that I could not have been more wrong about ME:A.

I think part of the reason why I did not initially like it was because this game had a very high expectation and I found myself wanting to have the original ensemble of characters in the game -- giving in to that crippling nostalgia. I also remember the bugs and the lack of polish on the facial/character animations was also a huge drawback.

I found myself really enjoying the story now that I was able to detach myself from the Original characters and I can say that this game on its own is beautiful and unique in its own way. It is a wonderful sci-fi story that really digs into the cornerstone of the genre and explores ""deeper truths"", philosophy of the Turing Tests on AI, and the exploration of ""god, faith, religion and what comes after death.""

Its a shame that support for the game has been suspended and I would have loved to have seen more single player DLC and some of the stories completely wrapped up.

I will play this game again in the future with stronger hardware as I consider this one of my ""rough-diamonds"" because there is an epic underneath all of its technical/developmental limitations.",1656267881,1656267881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll say this instead : It's a good game.
Yup, that's about it : if you forget all the previous instalments and measure it as its own game, it's good and enjoyable ( after the patches, that is clear : before was a critical mess).
All in all, a good story (for the most part) , a good gameplay and a good soundtrack is basically what this game has to offer to the player.
However, it gets repetitive after a while ( both in story and gameplay) and, in my opinion, they didn't manage to give a proper sense of exploration  this kind of game deserved.
And that's where it actually it felt short : the game did play safe, offering all the old setting and adding just two races ( which one of them is the classical alien bad guy) and not truly an experience of discovery that this game clearly was meant to be.
On top of that, unfortunately, when a  comparison with the previous establish franchise comes to mind, one have to, in all honesty, describe this latest entry of the mas effect universe as lacking in ... every single feature compared to the original trilogy ( which takes most of the setting assets, hence the comparison is almost obligatory).

Play it as it is and do not expect to see Shepard in it, every character is made on a different way and its unique without repeating as Mass Effect 1/2/3(which was not bad but if there was one more similar/same story and way of making it, it would get boring).

- combat was the most fun of all ME games, you're not vertically challenged, skills are not limited based on class.  The first architect fight was the best fight I remember in quite a while.
- driving is much more smooth compared to mako and hammerhead
- good graphics
- Crew members are fun and you can form strong bonds with them like previous games

Bad:
- Several missions involve going from planet to planet, completely unnecessarily.  Have us stay on the same planet for a mission instead of jumping around everywhere
- Hate the animation for switching between galaxies (cannot be skipped)
- all asari except for Peebee look the same
- Choices don't matter as much or have much impact outside of their specific mission
- Still has bugs like random voice lines being said at Nexus places, and the nasty autosave load freeze

MEA has an interesting premise of exploration and settling new worlds in a new galaxy, and combat is very fun.  The main issue is that MEA seems more like a bunch of interesting ideas that are put together, instead of connected and fleshed out.  Kett, Scourge, Remnant, and Jardaan are all cool pieces but ultimately raise more questions than answers.  Several side missions have interesting twists but ultimately devolve into jumping from planet to planet unnecessarily and are not impactful to the game.  It would have been cool to see recurring side characters or ones that could really impact the ending, rather than ""I need help"" -> go planet X -> ""thank you"" and that's that.

I've been a huge fan of Mass Effect 1-3 for years, and while I love this game, it's only fair to state that it's nature and tone are vastly different. In the original trilogy, you play as a commander; a military specialist and one man (or woman) army. In Andromeda, you're Scott or Sarah Ryder, and are essentially an extremely competent scout. I feel like a lot of the hate this game gets is over the fact that people might have been expecting to play a story about Captain America, and instead got a story about John Smith from Pocahontas.

Even with that said, combat gameplay in this game is glorious. All of the new abilities are fun to mess with, the leveling system is solid, and best of all, the game has a ton of vertical mobility. Unless you get motion sick easily or hate having fun, it's hard to imagine someone really disliking the way combat feels in this game unless they had a really big personal gripe.

The story is great too, and actually somewhat unique in the way that you're fighting to build something instead of fighting to protect what already is. The theme of keeping hope is pervasive, and it's always fun to see how all the races interact.

Character wise, I think they're great. It'll frankly be down to personal taste with this one. Either you'll like them because you do, or you won't because you don't. Characters here seem to be written differently from the original trilogy for good and for ill, and I'd say I've enjoyed them roughly the same in spite of that.

I finnished this game on console and bought it for the multiplayer, since it was pretty cheap and I liked it.

The first thing you will notice is that this is not the OG Bioware, it's the ""new and improved"" one with all the clichês and other bullshits from unexperienced writers.

That being said, the story is bad, it's pretty much a find the maguffin with your AI, and the AI will do everything in the game. There is no seriousness, always some remark or joke, almost like a Marvel movie.

Speaking of movies, the cutscenes are either funny for how bad it is or just plain awful.

The characters are boring at best and horrible at worst.

Speaking of characters, they all have some sort of tism, or facial deformity, almost like the Andromeda Initiative grabbed the entire population that was born after the nuclear fallout of Chernobyl and put them in a ship bound to andromeda.

Also it has a very empty open world, I don't know what goes on a triple A dev to just create a big map and think that it's enough for the players

Also Bioware is not updating the game anymore

I found Andromeda really hard to get into originally. I wanted to be playing other things at the start as it just didn't grab me like the other games did. It took about 8/9 hours before I even started enjoying time there. And then it felt good for a while before eventually just getting boring again that I just rushed for the ending because I just wanted to move on.

What I enjoyed from this game was the combat. I ran around with a pistol most of the time, focusing on my biotic powers. It was fun to clear a room with a biotic combo, jump jet around just popping headshots. That's where I was enjoying my time.

Unfortunately, that was about all I enjoyed. The writing was cringy at times. ""I think I really pissed that one off. Maybe it's because I shot him in his face."" was enough to sigh right at the very start of the game. And Kallo speaks for us all with the ""Kill. Me. Now."" dialogue.
You create a twin at the start of the game, who then spends all his time in a hospital bed and even when he wakes up you get brief dialogue choices about your past and then he comes into play extremely briefly at the end. Creating another character for him to be essentially useless is just bad. I know he's used for story purposes but he could have been so much more.
The sqaudmates in this game are essentially just reskins of your squad from the first game. Two humans you barely use outside of the first mission, a badass Turian who takes things into her own hands, an Asari researcher and a Krogan who's stuck in the past. The only different one is Jaal and even then I didn't find him all that interesting. And interactions with these characters felt so much worse too and every time I interacted with them it just reminded me I could be playing a better game. That being said, I did like Vetra. She was just a discount Garrus though.
Small pet peeve that really annoyed me for some reason. The doors at Kedara port took longer to open than ANY other doors in the game. For no reason. It was so slight but just enough to be annoying to the point where I just avoided going to Kedara for most of the game.

This game really was not that great, but there a bit of fun to be had in between. Only buy it on sale, because this game is definitely not worth full price.",1655581558,1655581558,True,1,0,0.523529410362243652,0,True,False,False

I'm going to go over MOSTLY positives in my review because there are a LOT of conversations about the negatives out there to read and there's no point beating that particular dead horse any further, but where it's applicable to what i'm talking about I may mention negative opinions as well.

The combat in this game is far and away the most satisfying in the series, Largely thanks to the freedom and creative control given to the players. In this game you build your own class to shape your own playstyle, rather than being trapped into a ""I am the vanguard, therefor I must charge"" type playstyle. It incorporates Mass effect 3's vastly superior weapon systems as well, you can use any gun you have the weight capacity for.

Exploration; The major planets in this game are a far cry from the timewasting massive empty fields or annoying mountain hells of Mass effect 1, While some of them are still a bit too big for the amount of content in them there was always at least something in sight, some enemies to fight, some treasure to collect...the worlds at least felt alive, and while they could still be improved I was happy with all of them. In a bizarre twist of fate however, this game has easily the worst SPACE exploration in the entire series, largely due to massive time-sink transition screen caused by this game being designed for inferior hardware(read; playstation 4 and xbox 1)...so you win some you lose some, but at least they finally made a vehicle that isn't made out of paper and is actually fun to use in the open world sections of the game.

Companions; This one is going to be a bit contentious. If you think too hard about them, it becomes clear that the characters are ripped from earlier games with slight changes. You have Ashley Alenko(Female soldier with biotic powers, but this version thinks she is an alien instead of hating them), Jacob/James Andromeda edition (More reckless and stupid than James, has the ""fellow soldier"" energy Jacob was going for), Netflix adaptation Liara (Young Asari female with an unhealthy interest in an ancient civilization tied heavily to the plot of the game, and big mommy issues), Lady Vakarian (Turian skirting the line between the law and the criminal underworld, using her shady connections to help the mission), Grandpa Wrex (enough said), and...Jaal (He's actually pretty unique as far as companions go, no hate here but you could draw similarities to Tali and/or Garrus' role in the first game if you really wanted to stretch the analogy). All that said, I think they managed to somewhat pull it back later into the game and give them their own unique spins through their later companion quests. I hated their guts playing about 30 hours into my first attempt at the game, but in this 70 hour completion they definitely grew on me and showed their uniqueness more. It's going to vary a lot from person to person if you like them or not but personally I felt they were a net positive, they just needed some stronger support in the early game (and better introductions, in cases like Drack)

Non-companion characters; This was a great step up from previous games. This was the first game where I felt a non-companion romance option was even potentially interesting, and the supporting cast are leagues better than in previous games (at least mechanically, nobody will ever top Anderson and Joker obviously). The Directors have their own motives and issues that while annoying at times also make them feel believable, rather than just being a means to progress the story like the council were in previous titles. The supporting crew on the ship were interesting and provided a lot more insight into the game's universe (Suvi for example had some interesting views on human faith in the mass effect universe that felt like real opinions rather than just preaching, and Gil had some heavy moral conversations about 'civic duty'). One of my favorite parts is that managing to save or promote Pathfinders from other arks actually has impacts on a number of quests and story elements in the game, the other Pathfinders actually fill a role similar to what Spectres SHOULD have been in the original trilogy, where they often help you or save other side characters rather than just being an antagonist or a boring quest giver.

Crafting; not much to compare to as this was a first in the series, but it was pulled off fairly well and it added a lot to the game, allowing you to properly customize your weapons based on your 'role' much more than even the attachment systems in ME3 did. If you aren't interested in making use of it however, it's by no means forced on you as you will always find 'on level' gear in the open world loot, and you can easily get through the game without crafting once if you prefer playing it that way, so it was really well designed and implemented in my opinion.

All in all, while I won't try to say this game didn't deserve the hate it got on release and I will stand by it being the weakest mass effect title by far, I also think it has a lot going for it and is worth playing at least once (if for no other reason than to have an end-game save file in case ME4 has Andromeda save compatibility, as the devs have suggested it might). Buy it on sale and you can get it very cheap at this point, though even at full price ($30) I would say it's worth it.",1655490139,1655490139,True,9,0,0.601184308528900146,0,True,False,False
1238000,117126385,76561198015725296,0,4,6580,0,5549,1682845628,"This game is absolutely brilliant! I honestly do not understand what the hatred was for this game when it was first released. I get that the original had its bugs etc. but the first Mass Effect was honestly just as bad.

I have some points I have picked up:
1. It has, hands down, the best combat of all of the Mass Effect games, going back to the others now is a chore so feel lucky for this game's mechanics.

2. There is literally so much to do. The world is expansive, literally teeming with things but in a genuinely realistic scale without being too much. Every time I feel like the game is winding down and I've done pretty much everything, I stumble across another two missions and get to kill more enemies or my companions have more comments to make to each other. It’s great. 

3. The free roaming options are great, you can just go anywhere and do anything you want, especially when you've started the colonisation process.

4. The galaxy map is absolutely gorgeous!! I never thought I would find flying through a galaxy map so damn fun, the visuals are breath-taking and you can tell just how much time, effort, and energy has gone into just this one part of the game. You are truly exploring.

5. The Tempest is the perfect size for a hero ship, it has multiple levels and areas, some not as easy to move around in but it’s yours and you can see the crew just doing their thing which is great. They also have some of their interpersonal issues and this makes it feel right that you're all just people trying to get through it all and the characters are all a good change from the tiny number of crew in past mass effect games that you learn about.

6. The world feels lived in, and it is vast in its depth. Some pieces feel slightly out of scale or proportion given the number of colonists and the time line, though you can forgive this as it’s such a small detail. The main thing is just how much of a variety there is, every world is so different and there are minimal copy and paste elements, unlike previous games.

7. I will be the first to admit this, the start of the game, the whole 'Pathfinder' thing, was obviously there from the get go, and therefore was the first to be written and then barely touched again. This felt like a pilot episode from an ok first season of star trek or something. Just getting through this was a slog, so I get it, a really stupid oversight from the developers. Then the Rider thing with becoming Pathfinder was very jarring, yet give it a couple of hours of story, and its honestly a distant memory and the rest of the game is a joy, trust me.

8. When it comes to the main story or side missions, nothing feels particularly repetitive. The entire game had only a few filler bits to it and only on those bits did I feel like I wanted to choose something else to play. The messy encounters were also vary rare, when you find yourself in an awful saved file and have trouble getting out of it. I think this only happened twice but the game is forgiving in these instances.

9. A lot of criticism came from the lack of variety of faces and their expressionless (-ness), although I have played the legendary edition and so this is less of an issue, the Asari and Krogan are still the ones with issues. The Asari especially are just the same model so this is slightly annoying. 

As for all the rest, especially the human faces, there is incredible variety and this is brilliant. For reference though, please look back on the first two Mass Effect games and try telling me that those faces had any expression other than resting bitch face!!

10. A huge criticism was the scrip writing, such as the 'my face is tired' or something where it felt unpolished and a bit untreated. Everyone laughed and joked about it but honestly I have another theory; I find this to be a breath of fresh air, because it feels human, it feels raw, like people have had to deal with an uprising from people they trust, good people turning on each other and the entire mission in tatters. It feels real, far more so than a perfectly balanced galaxy. You can see the flares of humanity within the writing. The first couple of missions notwithstanding, the rest of the scrips are really top notch even with these errors because we can all relate to it.

11. The combat. Hand down, awesome, far better than the Mass Effect trilogy and it’s all in environments where you can use the ground to your advantage. The combat can be harsh, unforgiving, that’s the challenge its raw and brutal at times, so you learn to fight dirty. Blood , heads blown clean off,  variety of deaths, it’s great. My criticism is that the enemies don't react to weight of fire.

12. I really enjoyed watching the worlds grow as you progress, there are times when you just notice something which wasn't there before and you can’t resist exploring it so it’s a really nice touch.

13. I found the Rider character, who I played as Sara for my first playthrough, was a joy to see grow into a powerful character. The whole 'Pathfinder' thing notwithstanding, I really liked the progress she made, from a frightened young colonist, world weary and nervous of being a leader, who just wanted to help her family in a new galaxy, to being a strong minded, talented and force against the established order on both sides of conflict. She felt to me like she was earning her place in a lawless and tainted land, yet she held firm to what she believes in. That is the sort of story arc we should all get behind.

We all love Shephard, he/she is the best, we have all had out fun over the years with them and you can never take that away, although slightly flawed, the dancing etc. there was nothing this person couldn't do, they feel god like. I never once felt that way with Sara, and that helps to improve the story and especially my interactions throughout the game. 

14. I've said before, the scale of the game is a bit off, the numbers of people involved on the nexus and the arks is just a bit strange to me. There’s no shortage of scavengers or random enemies you encounter, yet there are only 20,000 more people on the arks, so I don't really get that, surely just times that by 10 and it would all be golden. The time line is also a bit short, to have established a reputation with the Angara already as scavengers and trading port etc. etc. in 14 months just seems a bit short but what do I know, it’s only a game.

15. Speaking of the Angara, they might be the only race other than the Kett we meet, bit OMG what a race to learn about and be around. They're the richest and most flushed out race in all of Mass Effect, and their culture and Jaal's presence makes it perfect for the start of what could have been a trilogy.

16. And finally, sorry for such a long review, I just love this game. It is just so cool to see how the developers created such an expansive and impressive world to explore, with the Nomad being a wicked machine, (especially on ice) and where it has no weapons, you need to be more creative and not snipe enemies with a great big cannon like before! The game has a few bugs, so what, its so good to play, I was barely able to stop playing it because it was so good. So few games do that to me. 

I understand people didn’t get the Reapers, or a new Shephard, the first and last missions weren't very well thought out or grand, yet, they're such a small part of this game, the rest of it, even the music, is just perfect. So well done to the developers, and shame on the community who fought so hard to s*** on this game, well done for stopping the journey from continuing because this was the best you were going to get for at least 10 years. I hope there is something more to see in the future, but I will whole heartedly recommend this game.

Why did people hate this? 

I suspect that while this game is a 8/10 (it's fun, it's engaging, the story is interesting), there was an unfortunate combination of too much anticipation for too much time and that comparison to what many consider to be a masterpiece. Kinda like comparing Avengers Infinity War/Endgame story arc to Captain Marvel or Venom; it's related, but not necessary. However, it's still a fun trip. Maybe not the best metaphor but it's sorta how I see it. As a first time player of  ME franchise, I find that Andromeda, while maybe not a necessary game in the series, is fun as f*ck, just as satisfying,  and holds up well on it's own. An unfortunate causality of angry neckbeards with unrealistic expectation not allowing their favorite hero to retire and move on.

I totally understand that going from ME3 to MEA is a huge difference because the trilogy was built up to a very action-packed finale, and Mass Effect Andromeda is back to the beginning with trying to find a new home in a new galaxy; something I think it does rather well. They original trilogy and MEA arent really comparable story-wise because they're nothing alike, and that's by design.

That being said, I feel like the game could have had stronger writing, parts of the story lag somewhat sometimes. However, I feel like they created a really solid foundation for sequels. The story had a lot of cliffhangers that I'd love to see fleshed out. The companions are typical ME companions: some of them are unforgettable and amazing, like Drack (who I think is one of the best companions in the franchise), and others are pretty meh (with Liam being right up there with Jacob).

The combat in Andromeda is where the game really shines. Being able to level up all skills to create a lot of fun ME3 Multiplayer style builds is an amazing feature. Actual combat is fluid, engaging, and satisfying. Traversal, both in combat and not, is fun. The fact that biotic builds actually use their biotics for jumping and dodging is a really neat attention to detail.

Overall, the game is good if you give it a chance on its own, and stop trying to make comparisons to the original trilogy, as they are two entirely different games in the same universe.

I've played through this game twice. Once doing all the side quests and optional content to get the best ending. The second time I skipped almost all optional content, and just powered through the main story making all the alternate options.
This game failed to be worth its price tag for the first 20 hours or so. Mind you, not it's full price tag. The price tag of 8 dollars. It took 20 hours for me to think ""Yeah, okay, I feel like I got my money's worth.""

This game is very lackluster. The world building is bare bones, and at times contradictory with established Mass Effect lore. 

The characters all fall into a very ""Marvel humor"" kind of trap. Saying that as someone who likes Marvel movies most of the time. It's clear that every character is trying to crack jokes almost constantly to keep the tone light an fun, and it detracts from numerous scenes.
A positive is that I do think many of the characters are clearly established and likable. Over half a year since I last played, and I still know that PeeBee is a spunky tech head with commitment issues, Liam is a failed crisis councilor that seems to always make the wrong decision in important moments, Jaal is a family centric warrior that's very empathetic and cautious but also curious, and Vetra is a workaholic jack-of-all trades that puts the safety of people close to her above all else. Vetra was the hardest to figure out but that was a me thing, not on the game. They're all likable, and clearly established. They're passable for a Mass Effect crew.

The level design is painfully uncreative in most areas. Most of the time requiring the player to simply go towards a marker on the screen, lacking an of the engagement I considered integral to most of the original trilogy. Even in ME2, where practically every level is completely linear, there was still a degree of thought required on the players part to understand which direction is forwards.
There's a specific moment in this game about 20 hours in where the giant marker on screen, the one you almost always just need to walk directly towards, leads you directly into a solid wall. It was the first moment in the entire game where I thought ""Woah, wait, do I need to explore to get to my destination?"" and the answer was yes. The game required me to pay attention to my surroundings for a bit to get to my destination. The bare minimum for engaging levels. That was the point I thought the game was probably worth about 8 dollars. That was one of the arks, but I can't remember which, because nothing but that moment of walking straight into a wall was very memorable.

The open worlds feel starkly empty. The only saving grace here is that the car is pretty fun to use. Except when you're trying to go up a hill, and it just stalls out at an incline slightly too steep and long for the boosters, and I'm just stuck pining for the Mako. A sensation no one should have.

The story is just painfully bland. The idea of the Andromeda initiative is cool, but the Kett are just uninteresting. At least to me.

Best part of this game is the characters. Worse part of this game is its refusal to be consistent with the lore.

The 2 top rated thumbs down reviews are pretty much true. I want to add that this game is an alright game with the makings of a great game, but the lack of development time really shows throughout the game in the lack of quick and user friendly menus, the worlds which have the same fauna for some reason, the many interesting side quests that just don't follow through enough, the many fetch and wild goose chase missions around, and 2 more things i feel were the most frustrating part of this game.

The pacing:

I know the other mass effect games can be like this, but they were never this bad and always kept me interested. The pacing of completing a main story mission and then receiving a boat load of time consuming side quests you mostly won't care about just crushes your want to carry forward, you have to dredge through to get to the nuggets of actually interesting story or just to get to more combat.

The unskippable loading screen cut-scenes:

This has been discussed here already, but i want to quickly name specifically how bad it is. Here is a fetch quest in which you need only go to ONE planet, there are many that have you go 2+. each of the below are a cut-scene approximately 13 seconds long (yes i timed one):

This is not satire or exaggerated at all
1: leave the planet you're on
2: go through space to the planet you must fetch on
3: dock at the planet you have to fetch on
4: leave the planet you had to fetch on
5: go through space to the mission giver's planet
6: dock on the mission giver's planet to complete the quest
+: add 3 more loading screens if you don't start the quest already on the quest giver's planet to space travel to, dock, and leave that planet.

HOW, having being touched up after the bad PR did this model EVER get through? you might as well have kept the crappy animations, which there are still many awkward remnants of in pretty serious moments too. There's a reason i'm one of the only 18% of people who have the achievement for beating the game.

And the saddest part is that the combat is great and the story is actually decent, I actually want to see more. The parts that would be hardest to fix are DONE!

I'd heard mostly bad things about the game, and seeing as it was in the same BioWare ""era"" as Dragon Age: Inquisition -- which I think has some massive gameplay faults -- I was worried I wouldn't enjoy ME:A. Nonetheless, I bought this game on sale and gave it a try. The first few hours were lackluster, as it took me a bit to get used to the controls and the opening of the story is very predictable. ([spoiler]They gave us two family members, of COURSE one's gonna tragically die in the opening![/spoiler]) But I took a break after the intro and came back to the game a few weeks later, and I realized pretty soon after that... [i]this game is actually pretty great.[/i] The combat is fantastic -- perhaps this is sacrilegious, but I think ME:A easily has the best combat out of any entry into the Mass Effect franchise. The crafting mechanics are a perfect addition, but can easily be ignored if they aren't your thing. The companions are also great, and (in my opinion) almost all achieve the likability, depth, and quality character arcs that it took some trilogy companions three games to accomplish. The new human and alien models look absolutely beautiful, and the voice cast is perfect. I feel that both Ryders and all the crew and companions gave fantastic performances.

It would, of course, be false to say the game is completely flawless; while some scenes have clearly received extra attention and therefore feature pretty good animation, some of the less-polished conversations feature jarringly, uncannily static facial expressions and totally unmoving heads. There are also, of course, plentiful bugs, though many are solved via a popular bugfix mod that can be easily found on Nexus. It can also feel a bit unfinished, and I [i]really[/i] feel the game could have benefited from some major DLC releases.

All that being said, the pros absolutely outweigh the cons for me. I don't feel that ME:A is much more flawed than the original ME trilogy, and it beats said games in enough categories for me to say -- in my humble opinion, of course -- that Andromeda is at least as good as any one of the three preceding Mass Effects.

Let's start with the good stuff. You can pick skills from all skill trees. So you can mix 'n match your tech, biotic and combat skills in any way you like, wich is a big improvement over the previous ME games.
It looks great, if the main reason for you to play a game is to look at pretty graphics you should thouroughly enjoy it.
The story starts out great, you are send to a new galaxy to colonize it but it turns out after 600 years of travelling things have changed quite a bit. The promising worlds that you were supposed to settel turn out to be uninhabitable. You're tasked to explore one, crash on the surface, and come across hostile aliens and weird ancient alien buildings and technology.  You wonder what it all means and why they attak you. You manage to get back to your spaceship and navigate your way to the main space-station. It turns out to still be under construction due to all kinds of delays. You're send out to another world to see if it is habitable, come across all kinds of wildlive, get attacked by the same hostile aliesn, activate some strange alien tech and get back to the space station.
And then comes the bad stuff. Suddenly the station is up and running like nothing has happend. You're send out to more worlds with the same wildlife and the same hostile aliens and ancient alien robot guardians. There are other arks with thousands of colonists missing, but pretty much a sidequest to find them. No one seems to really care about it. 
You're supposed to be the one to find new worlds to colinize and are the only one who can control the ancient alien tech, but it seems it's equally important to travel from planet to planet to find find everyone's missing socks.
When you arrive on the Nexus (main spaceport, Andromeda's version of the Citadel) they desperately need colonies to survive and you are the only one who can make that happen. Except for the rebels who managed to find a thriving colony on their own without any help or supplies. The game is filled with these weird inconsistencies which for me totally break the immersion. 
One of the things that made the Mass Effect series so great was the depth of the galaxy, the different factions, their histories and struggles and how it all came together. In Andromeda that is all ditched for just 2 different types of aliens who are very generic good and bad guys. It feels shallow and uninspired. 
All planets have the same types of aliens, the same wildlife and the same kind of fedex quest who's sole purpose is not to flesh out the story or the galaxy but to stall time. 
The game starts out great, the idea of exploring a whole new galaxy should have been the start of an amazing new Mass Effect adventure, but after about 10 hours the game started to feel like a chore. There's no feeling of urgency to any of the quests. The main story doens't feel right. It shuld be more about finding the other colony ships and less about the fight between the good guy aliens and bad guy aliens. Maybe there was more to that story, but after about 30 hours I couldn't bring myself to wade through the repetitive fights and planets anymore. The only reason I kept playing for so long is that I wanted to find out what the deal was with the Remnant, but that was not enough to keep me hooked.

[*]Combat and movement are different to that of the original trilogy. It's now closer to the generic multiplayer looter shooter style. Fights with the added manoeuvrability are much more fluid than the previous games.
[*]Jetpacks are indeed the future.
[*]Driving controls are much smoother than any Mako iteration so far.

Bugs galore. Visual glitches, phantom quests, clipping issues. Doors that won't open? Bosses that won't spawn? Unsure of risking a save reload? No problem, friend, we'll CTD for your convenience.

Animations, textures and models are slightly better than at launch, bringing them up to the heady heights of ""merely bad"".
[list]
[*]Everything is an uncanny valley approximation of itself.
[*]The faces. Oh, my.
[*]Each member of an alien race is differentiated only by an obnoxiously bright primary-colour skin swap.
[*]The Remnant Architect is a marked exception - 10/10.
[/list]

The writing is terrible. It's high school dialogue. It's The Big Bang Theory in space. It's the livejournal you hope everybody has forgotten about by now. It's someone attempting a coming of age story before managing to come of age. It improved slightly in the final mission, where I assume writers were employed. For everything else, it's straight from the Mass Effect section of fanfiction.net.
[list]
[*]The answer to everything is Friendship.
[*]You just have to Believe.
[*]All NPCs are remarkably suggestible. Any opinion the Pathfinder challenges is swiftly changed. Quests are solved, vendettas forgotten, philosophies reconsidered, and lifelong worldviews reversed by the equivalent of ""no, you're wrong"".
[*]Meet the Wacky Krogan. He is a nerd. He whines a lot. His introduction is to immediately fall over. Cue laugh track. Repeat sitcom style for all non-main NPCs.
[*]Very little character evolution. Characters may as well replace lines with screams of I AM DEVELOPING for the most part. It'll be about as effective.
[*]None of the existing races feel familiar in the slightest. They're reskinned humans. I don't know why. I don't think the writers know why. The characters themselves certainly didn't know why. They know only that the Pathfinder is right, and that is enough.
[/list]
There are four conversational options:
[list]
[*]'Emotional': This is always the correct option to select.
[*]'Logical': Casual, written by the emotional attempting to channel their online therapist.
[*]'Casual': Poor sitcom style. Expect ""sure, I believe you... NOT!"" standard of sarcasm.
[*]'Professional': What a child thinks an overly harsh teacher sounds like.
[/list]
Not exactly Shepard-grade personality forging.

The voice acting is massively jarring after playing the other games. Nothing sounds anything like what we've heard before.
[list]
[*]Audio mixing in general is atrocious. No voices have effects.
[*]Asari sound like bad human voice actors. They speak with a normal human pace, modulation and tonality.
[*]Salarians sound like sassy hairdressers. They speak with a normal human pace, modulation and tonality.
[*]Turians sound like bad human voice actors with a strong intermixing of sassy hairdressers. They speak with a normal human pace, modulation and tonality.
[*]Krogan sound like sassy hairdressers with a slight cough. They speak with a normal human pace, modulation and tonality.
[*]Humans sound like bad human voice actors.
[*]There was a single audio log from a Quarian. It sounded pretty good.
[*]Most of the Andromeda aliens have affected different native English-speaking country accents. Explanation: they 'come from different planets'. Like Aberdeen.
[/list]

I haven't felt this unengaged since leaving the Council to die in battle. The alien races are dire.
[list]
[*]The Big Bad Space Nazis. They're evil. You will be told this a lot. They love killing. They adore eugenics. Boy, do they adore eugenics. But also killing. And torture. They are evil. [i]Evil[/i]. This is the sum total of what we learn. They are about as one-dimensional as you can get. And you know, considering how strong their penchant for evil killing is, they might as well be marshmallow teddy bears. At no point in the narrative did it seem as though they were a real threat. I spent dozens of hours messing about; they responded by hanging around in the background somewhere. True evil, unbeknownst to the hearts of men.
[*]Counterpoint to evil: Well Adjusted Civilised Beings. They share their emotions. All of them. They say what they are feeling. They say ""we say what we are feeling"". You will be told this a lot. They are persecuted by the above (ref: evil). And, well, that's it. Hand to God, I could not describe any of them in particular. I am feeling boredom.
[*]An attempt was made to fashion an ancient machine race. Reaper-lite. We've heard it all before.
[*]Following on from the earlier mentions, the races we've brought with us on this madcap romp to another galaxy are very different to what we've come to expect. Everyone is depressingly human. Asari behave exactly like humans. Turians, likewise, are fairly nondescript in personality - gone is the laid-back nonchalance of the military focus. Krogan all just wanted to be botanists all along. Don't mention their history. Salarians aren't scientifically gifted in any way that can be discerned. Female krogan and salarians are no longer rare or reclusive; they're common and unremarkable and human, and just as badly-written as everyone else.
[/list]

Bad game design:
[list]
[*]Microtransactions. Clearly designed for their use The shift to multiplayer, and the redesign of the core Mass Effect experience to fit around it, takes a toll on the singleplayer side of things. Levels, equipment, fetch quests... A lot of time was wasted.
[*]Fetch quests. Paragraphs could be written on these exercises in frustration. There are the several quests on each planet to obtain/destroy/scan 5 random items. There are the tedious ""go here, fetch this, return to me"" transgressions against human dignity. There are the mind-numbing 'fly to seven planets and talk to the next person on my list' miscarriages of what could have been a worthy narrative, had there been anything to narrate. At no point did they enrich the game. A lot of time was wasted.
[*]Quicksave ability has been removed. Manual/autosaving is disabled for extended periods. Turns into Groundhog Hour. Try to remember where everything is - containers you've looted, items you've scanned, terminals you've accessed, datapads you've read - because you might have to find them all again. A lot of time was wasted.
[*]Harder difficulty = bullet sponge enemies. Insanity playthroughs focusing on weapons are simply not fun, especially in the early game; the bullet:enemy ratio is often insurmountable with the ammo to hand. A lot of time was wasted.
[*]The UI. Menus, controls, maps, the whole thing. The game in general was designed for a console controller. In fact, one achievement isn't achievable with a mouse and keyboard. A little [url=https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Hang_Time_Achievement_Guide#Controllerless_Problems]studio engineering[/url] will be necessary, my hard-rocking amigo. A lot of time was wasted.
[*]They've made exploring space exceedingly boring. Between each of ~100 planets is a flying cinematic. Sometimes more than one. Additionally, taking off or leaving a planet have two extra. [i]Each[/i]. A lot of time was wasted.
[*]Area traversal is ridiculous. Stepping onto your ship to do captainy things when on the ground is impossible. A simple 'talk to your crewmember' quest required, in order: walk to ship; enter ship; endure flying cinematic 1; endure flying cinematic 2; talk to crewmember; endure flying cinematic 3; endure flying cinematic 4; leave ship; walk to questgiver; talk to questgiver. The crewmember was in my party the whole way through. Special mention to Kadara. A lot of time was wasted.

However, I've followed with interest the steady upgrades and fixes that were implemented and finally decided to buy and try.

It's so unfortunate that this game is so BADLY optimized for the PC. It ruined what could've been a fun and enjoyable experience. First, I will say that the best part of this game is undoubtedly the combat. It feels fluid, quick, deadly, and fun (especially with a mouse & keyboard). I love the launcher jump and dodge mechanics. they are such great additions that I hope they keep them in the next Mass Effect game they make. The story is okay. I didn't feel the same investment I did with Shepherd and his team, but it is serviceable. Nothing special, just okay. I will commend Bioware for fixing MOST of the game, even though I still found some game-breaking bugs, and it's been 5 years since release :(. And now for the BIGGEST reason I don't recommend this game.

While you are playing this, WATCH YOUR PC TEMPS. For some reason, this game is so insanely GPU-heavy that it kept putting my PC in overdrive whenever I accessed the menus. I found it's because my FPS, in the menus, would go up to over 300 and would make my GPU fans go crazy. I could literally hear them distinctly work harder because my GPU got so hot that it was actually heating up my room :D. And the worst part is that they have no FPS limiter in the menu. Why they didn't put one in is beyond me. There is a mod you can download that would lock the FPS to 60, but my sweet spot is 100-144 FPS and there is no option for that. Honestly, I never finished this game because I WAS AFRAID IT WAS GOING TO KILL MY PC.

At this point, this game is ultimately a huge disappointment. And the sad thing is that it could've been great. They have had 5 years to fix all of these issues and didn't. I think Bioware screwed this up so much that they eventually gave up on it and decided to leave it as the technical dumpster fire that it is on PC. If you decide to play this, BE WARNED. Keep an eye out on your rig. Make sure it's not working at the speed of light to run this.

The story and game play themselves aren't bad, but the negative points that make this a bad game overall far outweigh the positives.

1 - The worlds are big and feel lifeless. They are sparsely filled with very tiny little enemy outposts here and there or with recycled wildlife that you can find on numerous different planets. It doesn't feel rewarding to explore and it mostly feels like a chore having to go up and around mountains in the Vehicle, that you have to switch driving modes to go up very tiny hills. 

2 - The quests are so uninspired and boring. Besides the main stories and your allies loyalty stories, the mind numbing fetch and grab quests that populate this game are just terrible. It wouldn't be half as bad if they all didn't require multiple steps across multiple planets, because the cut scene flying to different planets and landing on them are unskippable, and when you have to travel back and forth MULTIPLE times just to go talk to people back and forth... well it gets extremely tedious and boring. Literally they could have solved this by just being able to call and talk to quest givers from the main ship, but no they make you fly back and forth every time. i cant stress enough how mundane this is. You will end up wasting literal hours of your time just watching the ship fly to a different planet and land by the end of this game. 

3 - This last point is subjective, but my honest opinion. Half the allies you can recruit suck. They arent interesting. And the main new alien race introduced are boring and just unpleasant to interact with as well. Liam has to be the worst character in all the mass effect games, Vetra is annoying, Jaal is an emotional wreck the whole game, every leader in the Nexus is narcissistic and makes mistakes with everything they do. The krogan somehow have females everywhere now like the genophage just didnt happen, and half the alien races are missing. There are no Quarians, no Elcor, no Volus, and no Hanar. 

All in all this is a very weak entry in the mass effect series. the graphics are good, combat feels fluid, and the main story is decently interesting. but theres just too much wrong with the game to call it ""good""",1653960290,1653960290,False,167,3,0.827788770198822021,0,True,False,False

The point is, I got this knowing what I was in for, and I obviously liked the game well enough to play through it twice.

In this instance, having just played and thoroughly enjoyedLegendary Edition (having played the originals shortly after they came out),, I wanted another dose. Also, having gotten used to more modern ""open world"" RPGs, the old Mass Effect games felt a bit claustrophobic, both in terms of not being able to wander around, but also the very 2d movement mechanics (oh now, a 5"" wall, we must find a way around...).

Mass Effect Andromeda feels much more modern than its predecessors. The (surface) movement mechanics are similar to a modern third-person shooter (indeed, the jump-jet mechanics seem very similar to Destiny to me). But weirdly, some of the graphics (notably the Angara models) look pretty terrible. (Also, what is it with the Mass Effect artists and their obsession with terribly implausible hips?)

The more I think about this game, the more it feels like a case of a solid game engine servicing a half-baked story. It's pretty clear that the designers hadn't fully thought out the ""it took 600 years to get here"" bit (there's a side plot where they mention the names of victims won't be released until their next-of-kin in the Milky Way are informed) and making everything in the previous games long dead, buried, unreachable, and irrelevant seems like a terrible way to set stakes. 

My guess is they made it a pre-side-quel to avoid having to deal with the ""three possible universes"" any sequel would have to take place in.  Maybe, just shooting the breeze here, they should have thought about that when they wrote Mass Effect 3. How about having a single end universe and actually deal with the story DETAIL the way they had in the previous game?

One funny thing is that having funneled an entire trilogy down the stupid BSG ""can humans and robots ever be friends"" trope, Andromeda just decides ""oh, sure they can..."" And part of the 600 year time leap seems to assume that they climbed into their arks and then did not communicate in any way with the Milky Way (and, also, that no faster ships overtook or caught up with them).

Yup, the big problem with this game is back story and rationale. It. makes. no. sense.

And we haven't gotten to the point that the ""golden worlds"" are all planets that were only habitable because of active terraforming, something their probes apparently failed to pick up. (Sure, this planet is too small to maintain an atmosphere and weirdly close to the star, but let's stake our future on it rather than a billion more habitable options.)

Which is a shame, because the gameplay is pretty great. One of my favorite things is watching two or more groups of mutually hostile things (aliens, robots, rebels, whatever) fighting it out and deciding when to swoop in and murder the survivors. In the mean time, you notice that the NPC AIs aren't bad. Which isn't surprising since you have two NPCs following you around all the time and they aren't embarrassing.

I think the powers in Mass Effect Andromeda are by far the best realization of the ideas in the game. Powers like Overcharge (which just did ""something"" out in the distance) are now hella fun to use. Pull actually works for you the way it does for your companions. And they seem to have settled on NEARLY the right level of complexity for both the gear and skill system.

Why doesn't your 6WD have a gun or a telescope? Why?

So, basically, if you can switch off the part of your brain that wants the setting to make sense -- and obviously I can't -- this is a pretty great game. Otherwise, it's a good game with an embarrassingly bad rationale, hackneyed character development, and dead-eyed aliens.",1625504549,1653953121,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just played it for the first time a few days ago after knowing nothing about it, including that people thought it was bad. This left me with 0 expectations except for what I remember of the OG Mass Effect trilogy.

The Good:
- The crafting system for weapons + modifications. In addition to finding or buying weapons, you can gather materials to craft weapons like the Black Widow sniper, which is the Widow sniper from the trilogy except it's a bit less powerful if I remember the Widow properly. However, the weapon upgrades are AMAZING. Prior to the point of no return, I burned through all my materials crafting new weapons and armor including the Widow. A big problem I had with it in the first trilogy was the lack of ammo. The Widow felt like it was meant for high priority targets and those alone. In Andromeda, there's a weapon mod that increases your ammo value. I used the heavy mag version, which reduced fire rate but increased my ammo count to a grand total of FIFTY FOUR SHOTS. Suddenly my favorite weapon was extremely viable and could carry me through the entire rest of the game. I did sometimes switch to my shotgun or rifle, but that was just because certain enemies were difficult to kill with only a Widow at close range. All in all, I loved the system.
- The idle banter between members of the crew was also pretty good. Between Kallo and Gil arguing about the Tempest, hearing about Drack's medical problems, and Vetra totally not illegally acquiring things for the Tempest, spending time on the Normandy was an enjoyable experience.
- There's a LOT less obnoxious ""You have new mail commander"" than there was in ME2+3, which I really enjoyed.

The Neutral:
-The ending. The final boss fight was pretty good but abruptly ends. No spoilers, but you do the same actions four 3-4 times and all of a sudden the boss fight ends. It felt like there should be a 2nd stage. However, the post boss fight and epilogue were really good. There's also a short 'secret' ending once you complete the main story and get 100% viability on all planets that I enjoyed, especially since I had 100% viability before the final boss fight [Person preference, I could've done it after the boss fight]. It was certainly a great way to end the game for me.

The Bad:
- Dialog choices are for the most part meaningless. It's basically the meme where your choices are ""Yes"", ""Yes but in blue"", ""Yes but in red"", and ""No but actually yes"". There were a few options when picking up quests that seemed to be against getting the quest, but I was seeing everything in the game so I didn't check those.
- What are floors? The game bugged out a few times if I didn't follow the path I was supposed to and I'd fall through the floor, forcing a reload.
- Travelling between planets and systems was annoying. Going from planet to planet was fine for the most part since you could skip most of the cinematic, but going from system to system or to and from the surface of a planet had an unskippable cutscene which REALLY got on my nerves after the 15th time visiting the same planet.
- The worst part: THE HAMSTER DOESN'T MAKE THE SQUEAK SOUND! In I believe it was ME3, the hampster SAYS squeak and it always made me laugh. This hampster doesn't do that and it makes me sad.

The Sad:
- There's not more to the game. Because reception for Andromeda was so bad, none of the DLC questlines came out. There was going to be one for finding the last ARK with the Quarians, Volan, Hanar, and various other species on it, another DLC for finding a certain person that got mentioned, and one for investigating the people who made this galaxy's version ancient tech.
- I feel empty after playing this. I want to keep playing. I want to continue the story of Ryder and Vetra, along with the rest of the Tempest's crew. But I've done (almost) everything. There's just a few roaming side quests (Drive around attacking random groups of bad guys until you find quest items) left to do that are more trouble than it's worth, and there's no main/side quests left. I just want to spend more time with my crew ;-; Here's hoping for Mass Effect 5 to continue this o7",1653950367,1653950367,True,47,2,0.723805904388427734,0,True,False,False

This will be the only Mass Effect game I don't complete because it just isn't worth reloading or restarting repeatedly for a buggy mess.",1653644728,1653644728,False,12,0,0.581354081630706787,0,True,False,False
1238000,116071641,76561198041603555,1615,453,5574,0,5230,1653785588,"Mass Effect: Andromeda (MEA from here on) is a deeply divisive game that IMHO, was too different from the ME trilogy and while the wording many decisions sounds dire and consequential, analysis shows that there are actually very few significant choices. As a result, the game felt over-promised and under-delivered, A lot of the quests are also pretty lame, felt much like product of ""copy-pasta"" school of game design as they are basically repeated fetch quests. However, when evaluated separately from the trilogy, the game does deliver many solid hours of play, nearly 90 hours, with a ton of quests left undone. 

Here is probably the most controversial opinion: MEA is basically Far Cry 3/4 in space, or Face Cry: Mass Effect. If you have played Far Cry 3  or Far Cry 4, you would recognize the structure quite easily. The vaults are the ""towers"". At each map you can free roam with (or without) your vehicle. Fight around nodes (which may or may not appear on the map). Take out nodes and reveal more missions, or encounter more NPCs for even more missions. Fulfill missions for rewards. Apply rewards toward better weapons, mods, upgrades, armors, and skills. Fulfill the primary missions to advance the plot, or just play with the secondary missions for level and skill advancement.

Here, everything got a chrome of Mass Effect. As in ME, you can choose classes among soldier, tech, or biotic, or combinations thereof for additional ""profiles"" a la ME3. 

However, to make things interesting, you now have 3 different types of tech... Milky Way Tech (the ones you came with, but can be improved), Heleus Tech (the stuff ""native"" to the local cluster), and Remnant Tech (left by yet some other ancient civ). You can scan items of each type of tech to obtain research points (except Milky Way, which can be obtained through Strike Teams, which will be discussed later). You can then spend your research points on unlocking weapons, armor, or modifications. However, you then have to locate / accumulate resources to actually develop (build) the items you've unlocked via research. And some of the more limiting elements, such as Element Zero, can be a bit hard to find unless you get some of the mods that makes mining easier, or pick the cryo pod bonuses that makes mining easier. 

To mine, you drive around in the Nomad vehicle. When you hit a mine-able area, open the mining computer, and start driving around until you hit a high concentration at which point you call down a mining drone. That's it.  You can sometimes spot mineral deposits on the ground and tag it directly. 

Cryo pods and Strike missions gives you bonuses without actually playing the time by making small time commitments instead of fully playing the game. The details are too intricate to explain in detail. 

The actual game play doesn't vary a lot. You approach a ""node"" which can be small or large, you take out all the hostiles. The hostiles may get reinforcements. Defeat all the hostiles via any means necessary, However, there is one significant difference: the availability of jumpjets. You can now jump about 1 level high, maybe a little more, which while is nowhere near hyperkinetic as Titanfall, does add verticality to your typical mass effect combat, which is already messy due to inclusion of ""tech"" and ""biotic"" combat to the typical firepower combat. 

The skill tree gets a bit of a revamp and resembles somewhat of ME3, where you get 6 levels of each power. Level 1 is 1 pt, level 2 is 2 pts, etc. Levels 4, 5, and 6 gives you a choice among two so there's a bit of customization, often choosing between a strong attack against a single target or an area attack against multiple targets. 

You end up fighting enemies from all three research branches... Hostile former allies from the Milky Way have split from the Nexus and taken up life of crime, and are known as the exiles. The local Angarans are waging a desperate war against the invading Kett, while Kett and you are trying to unravel the mystery of the Remnant machines, many of which are still protecting the sites all over the planet. 

They also changed the dialog system, where instead of just paragon/renegade, you are evaluated on your psychological responses, from emotional to professional to skeptical and so on. However, these doesn't seem to have any effect on the actual convo so they end up feeling like half-baked. The interrupts are back, but again, doesn't seem to have a lot of long-term effect on things. 

The priority mission (i.e. story missions / campaign missions) are designed well. And everything seems to make sense. The trick seems to be despite what the claims to be urgent, explore every nook and cranny of the map if you don't want to miss any big loot. 

The personal / loyalty missions for the various crew members and allies are designed well, except the various ""aftermaths"", as they are basically ""go there"" missions without actually accomplishing things. 

It's clear that someone failed to go over the mission descriptions, as there are mission description does not include the full location. Unless you've played for a while, you're unlikely to recognize that Vortex is the bar on Nexus, while Tartarus is the bar at Kadara Slums. Similar missions are all over the place. 

There are also plenty of missions that felt like busy-work, as if the Pathfinder is the only one who's actually doing something. 

""Pathfinder, please find me 6 drones that crashed all over the place. ""

""Pathfinder, the Kett seems to have dropped monitoring equipment all over the planet, Raid enough Kett camps, disable enough of them to triangulate a destination, and wipe them out for us.""

The guns are armor are a bit... problematic. Buy the rest from merchants or use looted weapons.  You can make a few thousand off random loot every few missions if you are careful in going through a LOT of ""remains"" and containers, but you may feel short on credits if you are the type who must have the latest and greatest gear. Research and development does NOT give you the latest and greatest weapons and armor. Most armors come in 4 pieces: chest, helmet, arms, and legs. However, some suits only has chest and helmet, but let you add pieces from other arms and legs. And you are free to mix and match Milky Way Tech, Heleus Tech, and Remnant Tech pieces. What's even more investing, when a piece (weapon or gear) is crafted, one can choose to bake in some mods, up to 4 (or more with one of those ""extra mod slot"" mods. depending on the piece. Finally, the chest piece can accept a special mod from the remnants, which gives you a great power for a great trade-off, like lose 70% of clip size for 25% bonus damage if you hit weakspots (like heatshots). Different special mods do different things. 

And that brings me to perhaps the greatest failing of the game: horrible mission organization. In Far Cry 3/4, when you get to a place, you can bring up a ""nearby objectives"" so you know what had to be done in the ar good descriptions. Many of the ""additional tasks"" doesn't even mention what planet it was supposed to be on. 

So why do I still say it's worth playing? 

Simple: play on the easier modes, and ignore the additional tasks that you don't feel like doing. Only do those you WANT to do. 

If you do that, then it's basically Far Cry: Mass Effect.

-The open world is often empty and boring. You need life support to walk around half the time limiting your time to explore until you meet certain requirements.

-Loading screens will take up a decent percentage of your playtime.
-The story relies on everyone being useless and your character being a genius with a magic AI that can solve ancient puzzles. The AI thing is kinda used as an excuse but it explains nothing about how no one else ever figured anything out.
-The bad guys are generic take over the universe types. And even if you kill the final boss there is a big reveal of an even bigger guy because they were really hoping for a sequel.

+The Combat is actually really good. Most likely because it uses the frostbyte engine
+The new Skill and profile system is a great alternative to picking a class and allows you to vary your playstyle without rebuilding a character
+When the movement system works it is incredible. Dodging and jumping allow a huge breakaway from the cover based shooting of its forefathers.

+/- The sound design and some pieces of the soundtracks are really impressive but its inconsistent.
+/- Driving is either great or awful depending on which planet you are on.

I know of ME:A had a rocky start with development not being complete upon release - like most games these days. I'm playing the latest version 1.10 and my hardware is a GTX 3090 and AMD Ryzen 9 with 64gb memory. One of the best ways I can describe the game in it's current state is that it's a Golden Turd. You wouldn't turn down a valuable gold nugget just because its shaped like a turd would you? What this means is that it's a beautiful game to look at from a distance the visuals are amazing and can be absoulutly stunning at times. However, once you look a little closer you begin to see it's faults.

The first thing I noticed was of course the bland and boring way that people talk and interact with each other it seems so alien it and of itself; for example, the stiffness it peoples faces and monotone voices put me to sleep. There is nothing to grip me into caring at all about what anyone has to say I don't even want to experience most conversations as with each one my opinion of the game becomes less and less. Also, the way people move is just odd... I think back to when I booted up and played Mass Effect 3 for my second run though and experienced the way that the character models moved and how vastly different it was from Mass Effect 2. The way Anderson and Shepard ran over the buildings made me question Biowares developers abilities for the first time. In ME3, it became a non-issue because they only did it in combat and I never really noticed it again because of how the camera worked in that game. Also, I played a sniper and rarely moved unless I was getting a better shot. A soldier/vanguard might have noticed it more. With this game, MEA, the camera makes it a point to show as much of the character models as possible as often as possible and they move in a similar fashion. Sort of awkward like a marionette with strings either too short or long. It just feels unnatural and it's not hidden by my play style  or the camera.

----------I'll update this more as I play more.... 5/25/2022 ----------

Update on Combat the best part of this game. The combat to my surprise got even better with time it was frustrating in a fun way for the most part jumping around and once I got a handle on using cover it became a simple matter to beat most mobs. I followed a guide and made a Biotic Command type hero that used used a charge, lance combo to deal massive damage. I ended up becoming once again a version of superman and only being able to be defeated if  i stood around and allowed the enemies to kill me. Getting to that point was fun and then beating the final boss by just staring at it and sometimes firing my shotgun was a good end to the game. I stand by my first impressions though and and still only recommend this game at a heavy discount to be played in between other major titles to pass time. -----------------------

Right now it sits at a 5.5/10 for me the in your face character models and weird animations totally throw the beautiful graphics under the bus making the entire game lack luster. The only thing I've mostly enjoyed is combat and even that has it's faults which i'll develop my opinions on more as I level up.

It's a great framework for Mass Effect 4 if only the developers are given the time and resources to RnD something that combines both the beautiful graphics of this game with greatly improved character models and writers with more like 1 year experience, it could be unbelievable...  only time will tell.

As far as Andromeda this is my second playthrough. I admit I didn't like Andromeda as much as I should've the first time I played it in 2018 because of all the bad press it got, it got to me. For reference I finished all the quests in Andromeda the first time (100% completion). And right now I am almost done with the game at almost 113 hours, maybe 10 more hours or 20 to reach level 80 with 100% completion, who knows (I take my time and talk to every npc I see). Regardless. I think this game is an underrated masterpiece. 

I believe one of the reasons people didn't like it as much as the original trilogy is because obviously it was missing the iconic characters like Liara, Tali, Garrus, Wrex, etc. Well in Andromeda I loved Peebee, Drack, Vetra, and the other characters are decent too, but nothing to write home about.

I'll start from the positive things:

- Combat. It's more smooth and fluid. You can fly and shoot. Plenty of weapons with same weight mechanic as in ME3. Sadly, you cannot change weapons of your companions at all. Not upgrade, not change to better. Fights are somewhat chaotic as enemies can also turn invisible and fly or flank you.

- Graphics. The environment is beautiful and full of colors. 



And... that would be all when it comes to good side of the game. What was bad then?

- 0 impact on main character personality. Absolute zero, null, nada. Doesn't matter what dialogue option you pick, you'll stay a friendly neighbourhood pathfinder till the very end, Not to mention MC is very indecisive and has to be told where to go and what to do, either by team or SAM. Very annoying,

- No matter how you treat your team, nobody gonna hold it against you. No betrayals, nobody dies. It's so rainbow and sunshine it's really beyond stupid.

- Only few decisions (usually QTA) change some plot of the game but doesn't provide more than change of a plot bit. THERE IS ONLY ONE ENDING so yeah, you can't screw up no matter how hard you try.

- Relationships are dull. Like all the relations on the crew between everyone. When you learn their backstory they were usually N7 who ran away because they had enough of being ordered around and yet they fell into same shit but don't realize it? Yeah, sure. I felt stronger connection to Avictus Rix than whole crew altogether, which is pretty funny as Avictus is some random character you help. And yet he would be better on the crew rather than, let's say, Gil - who only talks about breeding and making babies. Like, wtf, seriously. Every single convo is about making babies, it's retarded.

- What everyone valued in ME trilogy was emotional roller coaster and I think devs forgot about this aspect. You won't get anything like that, not even chinese ripoff level. There are some quests with potential but I don't think 1/5 of good quests can change anything when 4/5 are garbage.

- Animations are tragic. Fish eyes, 0 face expressions. When I was listening to any dialogue I was just looking at my other screen as it was so cringe I couldn't stand it. It's game from 2017, why it was made this bad? There is even a scene on the roof with Reyes where you drink whiskey and Ryder doesn't even open mouth to drink. Just pushes the bottle into face and back. This is some new way of getting wasted?

- Not skippable animation of landing/departure. Have to be modded. They are way too long.",1652776450,1652776696,False,4,0,0.512088298797607422,0,True,False,False

It had a very rough start (mostly due to rushed deadlines and a janky engine) but it's still a fantastic game. 
It is my opinion that the reason the game was so disliked in the beginning wasn't entirely due to it's bugs and glitches but primarily because it was a Mass Effect game. It was never judged on its own merit but on the merit of its predecessor. 
The ME trilogy was not just a tough but an impossible act to follow. Fans wanted more of the same and this wasn't that. 
ME:A was it's own game that, unfortunately, carried the Mass Effect moniker. Fans felt it diverged too far from the source material and that made it lesser. I tend to disagree.
ME:A is something new. Not better than ME but new and interesting and if it hadn't been so disliked right out of the gate, would have been improved and perfected in subsequent iterations. Sadly, we will never know now.
Still, it deserves its due. This was a deep, nuanced and worthy ME game that never really had a chance to shine like it could have.

The game truly deserves a second chance, it's like some people are still looking hard for excuses to hating it. The story is no where near as bad as they say, it's actually rather interesting. The companions? If you put Liam aside they're not worse than ME1's, they're actually a bit better and comparing to ME3 where they had 3 games to expand and grow on you is not a fait comparison (of course ME2 and 3 Garrus or Tali or Lirara beat them all, but their ME1 incarnations? Not really). Even Liam isn't so bad actually, just a bit too generic but do remember how useless was Kaidan in ME1?

In fact the game's main weakeness is not in its main plot or even its secondary characters, to me it's more due to Ryder not being good enough as a main character to make you feel hooked and as emotionally involved as Shepard could in the original trilogy.

Replayed the 4 games in prep for ME:5 when it drops. Half of the time spent was in this game. Sure its got its quirks (story and graphical) but overall i feel this game was given an unfairly bad rep. I'm glad i did decide to play this game again. 
Honestly i'm a little sad that it didnt go further, and the community (me included) have only ourselves to blame to an extent. We took our frustrations out on the game and the devs, when really the failed launch was more down to EA being money grubbing shills and Bioware Exc mismanagement.

TL:DR
The audacity of this atrocity is a travesty on modern society. This game is every bit as bad, boring, and repetitive, with brain-dead dialog and a woefully unsatisfying...EVERYTHING that was described upon release.

Do you see that 80 hrs on the record tag? Yeah, I mean EVERYTHING is wrong with this game. That is not an exaggeration, that is an irrefutable fact. It kills me that this combat system is now trapped in the steaming pile of unfinished garbage.

The textures, the shading, the character models and their faces, the dialog, the quest tracking, the quests themselves, the driving, the exploration, the plot, the pacing, the weapon balancing, the power balancing, the dime-a-dozen Big Bad Evil Guy, the [spoilers] fact that the final boss is a HORDE MODE versus the weakest architect in the game and YOU DON'T EVEN GET TO FINISH THE ARCHON OFF YOURSELF. EVERYTHING is BAD. And then the game has the nerve to tell you ""Oh there's a post-game mission for having 100% viability,"" HELL NO. I'm done.

You wanna know the best part of the game? It's how easily you can shatter the combat system's balance using mods and augmentations in crafting. A Tier X Isharay with approx 1200 damage, a single shot sniper rifle but with the augment that REFILLS the clip using 5% of your health. IT HAS INFINITE AMMO if you have Cora spamming shields that were spec-ed into health regen. Have you ever eaten a remnant architect alive? I have.

That's the end of everything I enjoyed about the game. Sure Drack, Gil, and Vetra have their moments, but the average person would want to strangle literally everyone else you meet in the game for how boring, annoying, and/or cliché they and their archetypes are.

It's as if no one wanted to take a risk on making a redeemable jerk, or someone that gets battle-hardened over time. Not even the protagonist grows up through the year-long war and responsibilities that are dumped onto their shoulders. Every sentence that comes out of their mouth is grating to the ears from how forced and cringe the writing was, much less the lackluster voice acting.

Bioware has become a disgrace and less than a shadow of it's former self.

YES.
Play this game.
It's great.
It's just not a Mass Effect game.

Morality (Para/Ren) is gone.
References made to older characters, likely because there weren't many interesting ones in this game.
Heck, one of them is Zaeed Masanni's son.
Why?
Doesn't make sense for him to be there.

The added jump-jet changed combat, but they struck out by removing features that were in the last 3 titles.
Features we came to know and love.

Missions Organization is a bitch, and makes it hard to check off the things you need to do without going into every ... single ... category ... to make sure you completed the one mission you were looking for.

The new Alien Race look like muppets.
The females look like they have anime eyes.
Their noses are too tiny, and their mouths look too human.
Attempts at making the females 'sexy' only made them look like they're from another game, entirely.

Characters are written well, and there is a lot of chemistry in the writing.
Kinda' saw the end 'punchline' coming, though.

The game is GOOD.
It's just too different to be a ME game.
A spin-off, maybe?

Would be a wonderful Star Trek game, though.

Do this to Star Trek, and I'll love you forever.

The combat is absolutely amazing. I would go so far as to say it's the best in the series. The completely open character advancement really allowed you to create a character that felt like your own and the route I went (biotics with a bit of combat) felt insanely fun and powerful to me. 

The storyline was good. I was always interested to see what would happen next. They kind of throw you into an unfamiliar world and you piece together what is going on as the game progresses but that's what your character is actually going through. It adds to the sense of exploration and discovery

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE

This game was very buggy compared to the Mass Effect Legendary Edition. It's been 5 years since release and I wasn't able to finish one of the side quests at all due to a longstanding bug. Some NPCs are very difficult to talk to due weird dialogue angles that are required. My character would randomly spout dialogue from previous encounters while going through certain areas sometimes. Just a lot of little bugs. 

I understand this is due to EA/Bioware basically abandoning this game entirely after it's initial launch. Which is a shame because other than the bugs, I loved everything about it. It's a very fun game overall.",1652070741,1652070741,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

7 years later is the game patched and alot better, area all the glitches gone. The game is definitely playable now but there still game breaking glitches 7 years later. Missions that get bugged and not able to complete Plus just overall game drops or crashes.


This may be the Most MASS EFFECTY game yet. Take that how you will but this games more about exploration than even the original. Sure more MASS EFFECTY probably is a bad thing as exploration in these games is usually a drag BUT...

The Graphics as for as scenery and Visuals are outstanding, However the overall implementation is still as bad as ever. Characters talking offscene when the game zooms in {which also messes up the audio, if you dont have subtitles good luck} characters still move thru their armor and have unfocused eyes just like launch. Even some of the cut scenes like in DRACKS mission are just plain bad

The characters are the biggest flaw over what made the OG series great. the New Cast even the MC are just hollow shells or just plain terrible [LIAM! i didn't think a worse character than jacob could be divined but yet here he is. The character his missions and even the annoying british accent are horrid and make u wish he could be left to arm a nuke...} The moments that could have been great are generally half baked. AS is the story tho the storys not as bad as the characters its still mediocre at best. Very drawn out and too much left without polish. I think this is largely due to Drew Karpyshyn {main story writer in ME1 and 2 , plus NY best selling author to alot of major star wars and other  novels....Read his work and how well most of his characters are fleshed out and the overall story and u can kinda see why} leaving bioware with alot of other staff. 

The combat is wonky i miss being able to use and select  ALL powers vs only able to use 3 at a time. IT is overall an improvement and more challenging. Adding the jetpack, augmentations completely changes flow of combat. The dynamic definitely keeps it interesting however i think bad squadmate coding theyre near worthless across the board kinda lessens the impact.

SPOILER WARNING


another thing is the unbelivability of some of the stuff. The overall story of coming to a galaxy with zero weapons on ships but armed to the teeth in weapons are an eye roll. Especially when you look at the weapons and military might of the main antagonist faction. The fact that they killed the MC 3xs in the story was also very farfetched. PLus millions of smaller things like how does the archon steal the Ark attached to the nexus without really damaging or seemingly attacking the Nexus??


Overall as a game from a MAJOR franchise even 7 years later this games a major letdown from the shadow of perhaps one of the greatest game series of all time. so in that aspect like 2.5/10 but if u look at it as its on standalone game 4.5/10 for great visuals and combat. Tho very poor characters, mediocre story and glitches and unplayable quest. ALSO not to mention achievement glitches and the one achievement thats virtually impossible on PC unless u have a controller.

Also its worth noting this game feels as long to play as the original trilogy combined. Yet more of a slugfest bc you tire of mediocre quest and there are 0 compelling characters to motivate u to push on thru. Also if youre going to completionist save before completing achievements as alot of the are bugged especially after long sessions and may not pop.

This game is much more slower-paced than the other Mass Effect games; there's a lot packed into it, a lot to do. 100% Completion will take a long time. Aside from a few bugs left in after launch, despite what I've heard about this game, it isn't that bad. There was clearly a lot of effort put into this game during development; an unfamiliar engine and a lot more aggressive corporate involvement from EA was where most of the game's problems come from, not BioWare itself for the most part. They did a pretty good job with this game despite the challenges and setbacks they faced.

People like to say the story is mediocre or the main-antagonist wasn't very intimidating or threatening compared to the Reapers.

First, there is a reason why this game wasn't titled Mass Effect 4; because it isn't. This was supposed to be a spin-off series, you can't have recurring threats or antagonist(s) because this game takes place in a completely different setting and time period. Second, the original Mass Effect trilogy was built upon one goal and one threat. The main antagonist was threatening and intimidating because it was the entire focus of the trilogy to a certain degree. ME:A consists of three major plots: creating a new home in Andromeda with Remnant tech, stopping the Kett and helping the Angara, and locating the missing colonists/arks. That is a lot, and depending on the order missions are done, all three tasks may feel like a long and drawn out process. Which relates to my third point: the game is long. The story will feel drawn out and the antagonist won't feel like a threat because the game is much longer. This can be a good or bad thing depending on who you ask, but this game should be treated like its own game/story, it shouldn't be compared to the main trilogy except for taking place in the same universe. That's why its a spin-off. I personally enjoyed the story. It was different, but still caught my interest.

If people could see past the game's bumpy release and also stop comparing it to the main trilogy, they'd learn this game is beautiful in its own way.

The main characters and companions are vibrant, fun, and fleshed-out, and they all have their own unique personality that they bring to the crew. Each one has unique conversations with each other when you bring them along on rides in the Nomad, which makes the crew feel connected. I found myself bringing all the companions along quite often, to hear how they interact with each other (I especially enjoyed seeing how everyone interacted with Peebee). The crew is on-par with Mass Effect 1's original selection, with interesting character development and backstories, and wholesome interactions with Ryder and the world around them. A lot of people still find the facial expressions kind of off-putting, even after the 1.05 patch, but I try to look past it. I think most of it was EA making them test out new face-tech. Anyway, I will tell you, Peebee was definitely my favorite. Of all the romance options, she stood out to me the most. She was unique for an asari squad member, and unique from any squad member, in any Mass Effect game, for that matter.

The environments are all beautiful, the enhanced graphics make everything look amazing next to the detailed world-building. I really enjoyed the semi-open-world take on Mass Effect, driving the Nomad through the dunes of Elaaden or the ice-lakes of Voeld felt so fluid and controllable, the addition of jumping felt different at first but grew on me quickly. Unlimited, faster sprinting made exploration very enjoyable when combined with everything else, and the environmental hazards made things interesting, as every colonize-able planet had one, which made them all very unique (although I wish SAM would stop notifying me every time I step in and out of radiation).

They really went all out with combat this time around, there are so many weapons and armors to choose from that all cater to a different play-style, and you have free reign to use a wide selection of abilities that make combat situations approachable from many different angles. I enjoyed using Peebee's lift ability to blow enemies out of the sky with fireballs. The research/crafting system was actually enjoyable, something I try to stay away from in other games, yet used heavily in ME:A, and rarely felt limited by the system due to a lack of resources, because resources were easy to build up large supplies of if you knew where to look. Weapon mods and augments for my own crafted arsenal gave me plenty of room to explore interesting possibilities (I ended up making a sweet alien rifle that fires devastating laser-beams). I liked the concept of combat profiles too. It really seemed like BioWare wanted players to feel like they had full control over how a combat situation panned out, and gave us plenty of freedom to find out what was most enjoyable. I haven't and probably won't touch multiplayer, but it probably has its own charm to it for players that are looking for that.

A few nitpicks, since I can't sing praise about this game all day:

- Have had some instances with long/infinite loading screens.
- Game goes into Windowed mode when I alt-tab, tedious to have to fix it every time.
- Melee is well made, but I don't use it much.
- I like all the squad members, but I never use Liam. Don't know why, just isn't interesting to me.
- Didn't use pistols much, might try them in my next play-through. Same for biotics; I think I'll try a biotic-gunslinger build next time.
- Cora was an interesting character but felt bland sometimes. Blame it partly on her voice actor who sounded kind of bored sometimes.
- Hang Time achievement is impossible on PC without external programs and/or obscure methods. They should've shortened the required time in a patch. The jet-pack related one was possible but clunky to pull off.
- Multiplayer is a pretty useless feature, I admit it.
- Landing on planets or jumping to new systems is too long to be unskippable. It was bearable in the original trilogy.
- SAM talks too much, especially about environmental hazards, and has a tendency to skip dialogue that is already playing for something unimportant.
- Enemies sometimes stand completely still despite me unloading roads into their face, or sometimes float.
- Squad members like to teleport around or float in my line of sight

Most of my problems with this game are technical issues or are personal gripes with characters/mechanics, but this game runs incredibly smooth on my computer and I rarely encounter graphical errors, which is a welcome surprise that makes up for the other technical problems I've had.

Overall, I think people would enjoy this game if they gave it a chance. Its a shame it was received so poorly on release; BioWare originally intended for Andromeda to be a trilogy of its own, and they would have introduced a Quarian ark in DLC, and the game would improve even further if they continued releasing patches and changes, but because of public reception they abandoned this game and went to work on Mass Effect 4 instead. That's probably for the best, but part of me wishes they at least left a small team to at least work on this game, even if it meant creating more games in the Andromeda galaxy was off the table. I think this game had potential, and I don't think it deserved the hate it received. BioWare put a lot of effort into this game, and if people played it as its own game without going in expecting the good old Mass Effect feel, I think they'd enjoy it. Maybe someday BioWare will revisit this game. Here's hoping.

There is shonkiness yeah, and very odd looking people but there have been so many genuine moments of awe and amazement already that this is very much my favourite Mass Effect after ME1.  Maybe even my favourite of the series.  ME2 and 3 were just crappy cover shooters, dull as dishwater.  But this is something else.

Just created my first base on Eos and standing there watching all the transporters zipping around is such an epic feeling of place.  Watching the Nexus open up you really feel the story unfold as you build up a new civilisation.  The scope of the game is very impressive, so much so that complaining that people have odd faces or that they walk a bit funny seems to be deliberately missing the gold in front of you.

Leveling up feels like it actually means something, unlike ME2/3.  Much better, more like an RPG again

Combat feels much more natural, less like ""Here is an obvious room with obvious covers and here is the obvious fight to get past"".  More like an FPS.  

The whole planetary / system exploration is the best of the series, it really feels like they made an effort to improve on the tedious scanning of the previous games.  The animations for travel and the graphics show a lot more attention to one of the enjoyable parts of ME games.  Best of the series.

The planetary environments are gorgeous, just levels above what the series had before.  The ice planet is stunning.

In-and-of itself, I give Mass Effect: Andromeda a Positive Review because it is a good game in its own merits. HOWEVER, if you're a Mass Effect fan and are coming over to this as a veteran of the trilogy like I am... You will very likely be very disappointed like I and literally every friend I know who's also made the jump from ME1/2/3 to Andromeda was. 

It's just... I'm sure there's more technical reviews that can explain all the issues, but the short version is; The backstory itself  for the game is actually incredibly good, congratulations and job well done to the writing department. The characters are believable and the other writing is also really good. Beyond that though.... Somehow, the graphics appear *worse* than ME3, the audio, both technically and the voice actors for various species, is *very* inconsistent from the trilogy (1/2/3). Basic QoL/variety options like choosing your companions weapons are non-existent. There's numerous painfully obvious glitches/invisible walls/misplaced objects, it almost seems like the game went through literally no quality control / bug testing. I could go on for a solid 10 minutes... There's just a *lot* wrong with it. If you looked at it of its own merits, much of that is passable and in line with other unfortunately standard current-gen games. But comparing it to its predecessor... It falls short in virtually every category.

So, in summary; If you have not played a Mass Effect game before, you'll probably really like this game. If you HAVE played the ME trilogy, you will likely be very disappointed with this game and I can not recommend enough that you not buy Andromeda.

If the header doesn’t give you a hint, this game was just a mess for my head to decide on would I recommend or not...

[u] Story - SPOILERS[/u]
So the story itself, as a whole, (as a whole is important), I thought was poorly put together, with so much that would alienate players… and yes that was a pun, feel free to stop reading, I will understand if you want to move on.

If we leave out the part that Andromeda is a spin off in the series, for just a moment, so that eliminates the huge amount of lore and species that invested players of the trilogy would have liked to see returning or represented, and just focus on the new... Two new species of aliens, (potentially 3 by the end of the story), are at war, one side a familiar society of aliens with hierarchy’s, feelings, families, a bunch of qualities we the player can relate and understand, but with seemingly little background or history, and with so many questions regarding there society and infrastructure choices that it leaves you thinking the entire species is stupid, with few aspects of the game even touching any actual depth to them. I felt like they only got there a few days before we did. The Angara; they are supposed to be a very emotional species, and your interactions with Jaal is great, but as a wider experience the infrastructure, innovation and leadership is just non existent with no historical significance to give the species a character... The story is set to explain some of the holes in their story but not all of them. I mean seriously what the heck? The more you learn about them the more questions you have than answers.

So yes alien species Angara are very alienating in how they exist, and then the main antagonists are supposedly this super evil race that want to bio-convert other species into them or kill them if they can’t with no other way to re-produce… Honestly there is nothing relatable or remotely empathetic about the Kett let alone sensible, the only thing they seem to have going for them is killing… like how is that any way for a society to function? How on earth did they get the ball rolling where they are from? Something or someone would have wanted to exterminate these things from the get go, especially as they are sterile, and they have no redeemable qualities, how did the Angara get hoodwinked by these blatantly evil looking things? The whole colour scheme of the Kett is like “here to kill you, don’t trust us”, our favourite colour is military death green, and 50 shades of evil for when we celebrate the Archon’s birthday. Anyway, the point is, if you want to write a good story make your villain… or antagonist race, RELATABLE… Every other game in the mass effect series does this significantly better than Andromeda… which would not be hard.

The whole thing besides the two alien races, is incredulous, oh so conveniently placed terraforming technology that literally magics planets into being habitable, which were uninhabitable due to giant space tentacle things… which is still unexplained by the end of the game, and… you know what I stopped caring. If you want to know more about the stupid narrative watch a youtube video.

The thing is, the only story worth anything is player interactions with their crew. That part of the game is relatively well done, relatable characters with understandable motivations and flaws… for the most part with some characters being noticeably stronger written than others... I really didn’t like Gill, he was bland, and so was Kallo, but I liked Drak, and PeeBee... . The pacing is pretty bad by the way, with the quest tracking, and story tracking system being really hard and annoying to navigate naturally, and there is no notably well written side quest with any kind of real investment with characters, so you are best off just sticking to your crew and leaving it there.

[u] Animations, bugs, and acting [/u]
So, the written main story sucks, but putting that aside how tolerable is the voice acting, animations and the bugs that supposedly pervaded the game on launch?

[b] Bugs [/b]
Yeah… its got issues still. Don’t get me wrong it is rare to come across game breaking stuff, I did a few times, where I had to restart from end of the first mission once,  auto saves stopped working for a time, and Drack’s loyalty mission broke when I jumped over a railing I wasn’t supposed to causing me to restart it. So as long as you manually save regularly and don’t mind backtracking an entire mission once, then you can play without issue really.

[b] Voice acting, and animations [/b]
Right, that’s bugs covered. Voice acting. I personally thought the voice acting itself, the actual sound files for the speech in game, is great, very well done, lots of personality, a lot of effort was clearly put in. The character models, and animations to complement and express that… I had to stop playing at times due to the pure disparity. If it was me doing the voice acting for a character I was portraying, where I put time, emotion, and effort into, that had as little care and effort put into expressing said time, effort and emotion through animations and model? I would have left. The animations and character models are so bad, soulless or completely absent! That I would say it is an insult to call them character models at times because they are so generic, bland and downright unimaginative, absent of any character you would expect to find in a game like this.

[u] Gameplay [/u]
Thank god this part of the game did not suck ass. I do not know how I sunk a 100 hours into this game despite suffering through the horrendous story (I mean I like the crew a lot, and the gameplay was set to hard difficulty so, the gameplay sections took me longer than normal by a large amount due to my stubbornness, and I experimented with gameplay elements a lot, before I decided I was going to experience every aspect of the game to review it.) Sooooo, I know precisely why I sunk 100 hrs into the game, but I wanted to sound like I had been robbed or wronged in some way to elicit a sympathetic response from my reader. You know how it is?

Moving on! The weapons, powers, and general balancing of the game is pretty well managed, movement is fun, the driving is well done… enough, and fun at times. The open world element is both a plus and a minus, I do not think it was well implemented, but it was done well enough that I did not really feel too bad about spending time navigating it, though this might not have been the case had I not played previous mass effect titles which gave me much needed experience in playing the actual game, as the tutorial kind of sucked, and so much of the game is left unexplained to new players I felt.

The gameplay is supposed to merge well with the story, but because the player will often move past sound cues or do something else than what the designers expected (they must expect people to freeze whenever something new occurs for like 5 plus minutes so that the gameplay goes off without a hitch). Anyway it doesn’t merge well with the story.

 I had fun with the guns and powers, but for a triple A game you expect more than that, and I didn't really come for the gameplay.

[u] Conclusion [/u]
The game is just underwhelming, I know a lot of people thought Ryder main character was underwhelming in comparison to Shepard of the main trilogy, I think this is not a fair assessment of the games wider failings that contribute to the character portrayal that ultimately leads the player to being unsatisfied by all aspects of the game.

This is not, in my opinion a bioware game, the studio has long since lost its key players, the quality stamp is absent, and the source of all evil in the games industry EA (Evil Associations), has engulfed the name in its bony death like grasp.

This game is highly likely to; Feel like a chore, aggravate you, leave you feeling underwhelmed, and wanting your time back... but you can have fun.",1650723617,1650724459,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

The player chooses the role of one of the Ryder siblings, who wakes up with many other astronauts after six hundred years in stasis. They are part of a terrestrial expedition traveling on so-called arcs to the constellation Andromeda to investigate the possible settlement of one of the planets.
The emphasis on exploring a new galaxy, where the purpose of the entire Andromeda mission is to discover the so-called ""golden worlds"" for human settlement, all in the name of the Star Trek desire for knowledge, struck me very sympathetically. The mission is led by Pathfinder, who heads the human expedition, and after about an hour of play, the role falls to you. From then on, everything else will fall on your shoulders: the discovery of new star systems, politicking between friendly races on the arks, and the fight against new enemies, represented mainly by the lizard race of the Ketts.

Unfortunately, the game will show you very quickly that no one has bothered with the most important thing, ie the story and the dialogues. ""I guess I have no choice but to be a Pathfinder,"" the protagonist shrugs after finding that the fate of humanity in the new galaxy hangs on him. Other participants and veterans of the mission are, in their own words, ""the best that came out of the Milky Way"", but they act like a bunch of offended high school students on a sports course.
The flatness of the dialogues and characters in places bordering on stupidity is astonishing, even in comparison with the fact that the last BioWare games did not show exactly captivating performances in this respect. The ubiquitous emphasis on romance is all the more annoying. Ryder can flirt with anything regardless of race or gender, and I wondered if his main job was to populate new worlds, or rather spread intergalactic syphilis.
Of course, decent plot moments return periodically, but the time between them is filled with stereotypical fetch side quests in a relatively open world. Nothing against him, but collecting resources across the planets slows the story even further.

Despite repeated criticism of the story, I mentioned many elements that work well and it would be unfair to the game if I did not say that some of them surpass previous parts of Mass Effect. I enjoyed the shootings the most. Ryder's mobility is pleasantly natural, the scenery is charming, the planting itself is interesting and the planets, although not very original, are at least diverse. In addition, the crafting system and the connection between singleplayer and multiplayer offer a lot of potential and flexibility to adapt the game to your style.

When no longer amazing, at least the dignified moments alternate with tens of minutes of silly side tasks, frustrating flying from loading to loading, bothering with the user interface, pointless scanning of the planets, and so on. But even if I think of content that the game doesn't require you to use, there are still a lot of padding moments. Then you just look forward to some epic moment that would get the legacy of the name Mass Effect. [b] 70% [/b]",1650718948,1650719006,True,23,4,0.740552127361297607,0,True,False,False

I played the Mass Effect trilogy via the Legendary Edition. Automatically, my heart went to Garrus Vakarian.

Andromeda is a much shorter game. Some of the loyalty missions are, sadly, buggy and I was unable to complete them (but they don't determine the final outcome like ME2). The animation and coloring is different than the original trilogy (brighter colors, seemed like lower quality animation, in my opinion). And of course, this is a different story so... No Garrus.

However! I do want to point out a character I ended up enjoying in this game was Jaal. He is honestly this game's version of Garrus, I think. Not a Turian, but a very sweet and gentle character of a different species that is available to romance for the female Ryder. Enjoyed his dialog highly.

Honestly, if you're looking for a quicker Mass Effect related game, this is it. I had things I liked and didn't like about it. I liked the ability to customize whichever Ryder you choose, plus your twin sibling. Reaching the goal of some side missions was hard, as instructions and maps were unclear at times.

It takes bad writing and generic game design to new levels. The gameplay and new races feel like something from Destiny, the races from the original games look abysmal with the exception of the Salarians, and no matter how hard the game tries I don't care about the characters, with my pet Pyjak being the most relatable crewmate because it has no idea what the hell is going on.

If you care about spoilers for Blandromeda or the OT skip the rest of this review because I'm going to use the ending and similar points as an example of why the writing is so appalling. Throughout the previous games you are fighting to stop the reapers from wiping out all spacefaring life. Your crewmates can remain as tools for you to achieve your goals, or great friends who you've gone through hell for and know they'll do the same for you. At the end of Mass Effect 1, you fight Saren, and then his cybernetic corpse controlled by a reaper. A highly mobile and deadly threat that can kill you in two hits on the hardest difficulty, and has mostly unique AI. In ME2 you fight the collectors through their lair, and lack of preparation or simply care WILL get the members of your team killed in brutal ways, one by one. You then fight a human-reaper prototype. Again, a truly threatening and unique enemy. In ME3... well there isn't really an actual boss fight, but the sheer enormity of your situation has been built up to for three games. Crewmates can also die throughout ME3, and now the fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders, and all your allies come to fight at your side similarly to Avengers Endgame. It feels like your decisions have led somewhere. Then there's ME:A's ending, which is, put lightly, an absolute mess. You fight some standard enemies while people you met once and can't remember help you and yell about how great you are. The last time I saw one of them they were saying how much they loathe me. Then you get to the end. The bad guy called the Archon has the cluster-destroying technology under his control... and then the most he can do is summon a Remant architect, something you've killed dozens of on foot, and apparently pose a massive threat to himself by controlling some standard enemies. You don't even get to fight the architect, might I add. It just watches you and occasionally coughs in your direction. So you fight some standard enemies, push three buttons, and... the bad guy just... falls over. And dies. I purposefully did as little preparation for this fight as possible to see if there'd be consequences like in Mass Effect 2, and no. No one on my crew died, regrettably. Not even a scratch. So in the end it just feels hollow and like my choices carry no weight. The final boss fight is actually quite ironic.

I didn't play it day 1, I don't know how bad everything was, but there are still face issues, there are still quite a few bugs (one that appeared in my last 10-15 hours that bugged me), but everything else was great, fine, or passable.

Cons
-Character Customization, as in how you make your character look, is completely awful. What you see when you make them, and what you see for the rest of the game is just different enough to be recognizable. First 40 to 60 minutes was me making a character and then restarting when I hated the look.
--Just to sound vain, the choice for Cora having visible wrinkles was a bit strange
--Also wish we could've played any race... but this is me just nitpicking
-I loved every character but Liam, but the final mission has all these random names that I saved from certain death like 50 hours ago helping me
--Liam is your male human crewmate to hate, because every Mass effect needs a terrible male human crewmate (I liked Kaidan and James, Jacob was okay). The only good thing about Liam is how fun his loyalty mission is, he somehow doesn't airlock himself out of the ship from his own stupidity.
-There are bugs for faces, bugs for your mouse cursor randomly appearing in the middle of your screen, bugs for not killing Architects correctly, and, my favorite, needing to use task manager to close out, because it'll bug and won't close if you close it out from the game's menu.
-Story is a valley, goes downhill real quick but has a great final mission. Most of the best lore chunks were at the start and right at the end, real filler middle. Which is unfortunate, since Kadara was my favorite set of missions, but were definitely all filler. Also a bit of a repeat from Mass Effect 1
--Character race trope for both crews is also similar. Turian rogue, Asari archaeologist, Krogan warmonger, Human military biotic, and Human Christian
-Missing a good chunk of the Milky Way races (Quarian, Geth*, Hanar, Volus, Elcor, Drell, Batarian*), Geth and Batarian might be problematic, since stigma... but so is putting Salarian and Krogan together. Quarian and Elcor were definitely missed and needed.
-Only 3 races (possibly only 2, if Remnant is just considered to be AI constructs) in all of Andromeda, but a bunch of new animal species are around
-Leveling up becomes redundant once you leveled the three skills, you'll use most to all of the time, all the way to max
-The worlds are way too expansive. There's too much dead space, especially in Voeld and the Krogan colony world
-I'll put this as my last con, since it's more of my opinion: Lack of a Paragon/Renegade system. You are forced to be the happy pathfinder, that is quick to forgive and be forgiven. Your actions will have consequences (kind of), but your conversations will not.

Pros
-This is the kind of combat system Mass Effect 1-3 really needed. Extremely fluid combat style, never being stuck on one style, but you'll probably be like me and stick to one style, you just have tons of options, which is good.
-While the crew isn't as great as the crews in the OT, I still like them... except Liam.
--Peebee also takes a bit to start liking
-The Angara are quite fun as well as their secrets
-For a game considered unplayable, it's still better than some other higher acclaimed games I've played, by combat alone
-Vehicle driving was fun enough
-Clancy Brown, from Shawshank, Starship Troopers, and Mr. Krabs, as your dad, Kumail Nanjiani, who's recently one of the Marvel Eternals in the MCU, as the head of the Nexus, Natalie Dormer, from Game of Thrones and Hunger Games, as your ship doctor, and Katy Townsend, who's most known as Cait from Fallout 4, as your on-board scientist and anomaly-teller voice; just to name the ones more recognizable to me, but the rest of the voice cast was amazing. Still a shame the game bombed.

I didn't get it on launch, so this is after the animation and bug fixes.

Gameplay 9/10
Story 4/10
Characters 6/10

The gameplay itself is fun and varied. The ability to swap between classes and build your own hybrid class means you aren't pigeonholed into a class like you were in previous games. It also allows you to try out new classes and weapons easily, which is great. 

The changes to the dialogue system are a good step forward too. No more good/evil binary choices, you're instead given the option of a ""tone"" to base your character off. You can be Emotional, Logical, Casual, and Professional. Unfortunately the game doesn't utilise this in an amazingly interesting way, just some comments about being ""too casual"" or ""very emotional"" if you lean too hard in one direction, but at least there's an attempt to break the previous games morality system.

Unfortunately that's where the good stuff ends. The narrative and characters leave much to be desired. The premise of the bad guys is fantastically boring. Big evil guys have the ability to take over your mind and turn your own soldiers against you. They want control for controls sake. Sound familiar?

The new friendly alien race are similarly boring. Bioware had an opportunity to make a new interesting species in Andromeda, but we end up with ""attractive humanoids who you want to bang"" how are ""super empathetic"". They're simply not interesting enough to read about their lore or their abilities.

This could be forgiven if the supporting characters were good (ME2 anyone?) however that's not the case. Very few of them have engaging stories or personalities. Pee Bee is the most obnoxious, but no one else on the ship has anything redeeming. Cora is boring, Liam deserves janitorial duty for being such a hothead, Vetra is also boring. The only interesting Character is Drack, and only because he's written like Wrex was a thousand years old.

I guess... Don't get me wrong, the game is a good game but it is not a good mass effect game. It wants to be so many things and the old saying ""jack of all trades, master of none"" could not be more truthful with this game since you have planet exploration... kind of, or interactions with new exciting species... kind of, or a high stakes galactic conflict... kind of.

But this is a Bioware game, you are here for the story right? Well... the story starts really good, full of action and discovery but little by little it starts to fall apart with so many clichés like the Remnant... the typical ancient civilization that nobody knows where it came from, or the Angaran, the most boring species in mass effect, you'd think that with all the crazy species we met in the Milky Way in the original trilogy, Bioware could create really crazy and original new species since we are in another galaxy... but no, we got the most basic species there could be, and don't make me start with the Kett, surprisingly they are worse than the Angaran.

And that's the problem I have with the game, I expected more from Bioware, but all the game is so average, the only thing that is above average is the combat system, is really dynamic and fun, and practically carries the entire game, well that and the Krogan, BEST. SPECIE. EVER.

It is a good game, but it drops the ball in important aspects and be the Pathfinder is not as impressive as to be THE commander Shepard, and the side quests don't help with that, since the majority felt like chores, I was all the time like: I am the freaking pathfinder, why do I have to help you to find your shoes??? Oh wait... I get it... 10/10 - IGN.

But (yes i know you saw the but coming)
The rest of the game does feel rushed at times. It feels as if they wanted to do more, like with the planet management.  If you go in with the mindset of having a mass effect 3 experience, you will be disappointed.

No where near deserving of the drama crowd.
Just finished it. Some parts cringe, some characters completely ignorable. And a real lack of ""renegade"" type options. 100% true. 
Probably too much open world, but that didn't bother me as much. 
Some bits feel too quick and not totally fleshed, like some consequences and some relationship stuff... etc.
There was also a shortage but not absence of choice/consequence in the overall story, but being the ""first"" that kinda makes sense. Would expect to see more results of that in follow ups.

But good god, this game does so much right that people seem to purposely ignore. Annoying characters get better through their own arcs, the over arching story is actually good. It does feel like an actual fight for life as you're progressing. 
The antagonists lean more to generic, but can definitely feel threatening. The other races involved are interesting and enjoyable, even the ones that don't like you. The sheer STAGGERING amounts of lore and potential within the galaxy.
The game feels like it should. Like you are actually strangers doing your best to figure stuff out.

The game play mechanics are great, feels good, reacts well. Being able to change your play style on the fly was nice. I did kinda miss being able to outfit my own party, but eh not a deal breaker.

This is one of the best games I have played in my 30 years. It has flaws both in animation / presentation and tedium to 100%, but it's still a good game.

It has the best combat in the Mass Effect series of games.

It has a multiplayer that you can find people playing still as of this review, and invite friends to.

THE PRESENTATION is the issue. Similarly people may bash on Andromeda for having ""Bad writing"" but they seem to neglect that it also has Good writing and moderate writing. So did the original Trilogy have bad writing too.

*** In Depth ***
100% The Game on Insanity. This is a single game, not a trilogy. It's unfair to compare it to the trilogy, and even comparing it 1 for 1 is unfair for the following reason.
It's a better game than ME 1, so it's more accurate to compare it to ME 2 or 3, but that is also unfair because you get more emotional attachment to the individual characters in ME 2 and 3 because of 1. Meaning you get more time with the characters to grow attachment, especially in the linear design of ME Trilogy. Which the exploration open world of Andromeda becoming tedious to 100%, but also necessary to get the full depth of character interaction with your Crew NPC's and the attachment to them is a bad design choice; but Andromeda has a GREAT design in the depth of the characters and their personality / quirks. Andromeda suffers from poor Presentation, but the content is there.


NPC team members interact with each other on the ship, walk around, make jokes with each other, flirt, etc. They discuss with each other while driving the Nomad vehicle or walking about.
I know that Jaal has Thicc Thighs according to Peebee, and that Peebee thinks I'm a horrible driver; but Jaal thinks I'm a smooth driver and has fallen asleep at least twice while I've been driving. 

GREAT DETAIL in the inter-personal relationships of your crew, even generic NPC's still have conversations with each other like in ME 2 and 3. Like the Turian performing poetry in the Bar on the Nexus.

There are too many unnecessary, tedious planets or anomalies to explore in the galaxy map, and on the planets themselves too many jumping unmarked or even marked 3 step side quests; which fast travelling helps on planet, but not in the galaxy map because of the loading screens and unnecessary camera zoom / panning. Poor presentation.


Some of the writing is awkward or poor in communication, but some of it is moderate or great too.

Similar ME 3 there are moments when a character's head could turn 180 degrees, insignificant bug.

Awkward over-twitchy eyes at times, but the worst offender is the lack of proper camera angle, zoom, and direction for majority of NPC conversations.

Texture loading is sometimes slow, and some objects (Trees or hair) don't feel perfect, some NPC's have better design than others so there is not a uniform quality.

Slow down / Jump / Hop animation going down stairs. Awkward, but whatever.


*** Tips ***

Set up profiles and use your hot keys F# keys, you may not have immediate use of more than 3 cooldown abilities but you do have immediate use of profile passive abilities.
Set up a exploration / scout profile for tactical scope highlighting, a melee profile, or a run and gun profile. You can swap these quickly as you go and slap a melee, swap to tactical and highlight and snipe.

Use Autosave, and realize you may have to go back several autosaves on the first Kett Base on Eos. There is a game breaking bug there that the doors may not open, but Autosaves save the day. Or manual save you desire.

Otherwise, Charge is a good skill to have",1648145424,1649606576,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

If you asked me ""would you recommend this game to me?"" with another ""bad game"", I'd be equally on the fence as I am now, sure. But [i]Mass Effect[/i] holds a special place in my heart, and the overwhelming opinion by other fans about [i]Andromeda[/i] is that it's a ""bad game"". I disgree. 

To start with, [i]Andromeda[/i] is most certainly not well-written or directed. The story is one of the most uninteresting narratives I've ever played through in a video game. The presentation is lacking, with dialogue lacking the cinematic delivery that elevated the conversations of the original trilogy immensely. Instead, most conversations play out as static over-the-shoulder scenes rendered during gameplay. It's boring, to say the least. From a narrative perspective, there's even more problems. I won't go further into this, as a quick search on YouTube turns up far better analysis' of the game's lackluster story than I could ever deliver. 

Characters are only marginally better. Out of all four mainline [i]Mass Effect[/i] games, it is by far the weakest from a story and character writing perspective. Only three of the six squadmates in this game were bearable for me (those being Vetra, Drax, and Ja'al, if you're interested). The others ranged from bland (Cora) to outright insufferable (Liam). [i]Mass Effect 1-3[/i], on the other hand, was a trilogy with some of the best squadmates out of any party-based RPG I've ever played. Out of the myriad of characters you fought beside, the only character I actively disliked was Jacob, and only because he's an utter prick. [i]Andromeda[/i] doesn't even make up for this with great NPCs, with the bulk of your crew lacking the presence of characters like Joker, Dr. Chakawas, or even Councillor Udina. 

But despite this being the worst written Mass Effect game, it is by far the best in terms of gameplay and combat, with only a handful of major flaws. Controls feel responsive, powers feel snappy, and being able to customise what powers you have available to you is much more player-friendly than the fixed classes of previous entries. 

In terms of bugs, Andromeda still has a fair few, but most of the bad stuff has been patched out. The game is stable, but has really long loading times. Unnecessarily long. I've been able to catch up on my uni readings while waiting for the game to load on occasion, and I have a SSD. There's also a fair amount of animation weirdness, and the FoV feels far too zoomed out compared to the original games. Menus have the worst of it, with unergonomic design and a terrible quest log that doesn't give nearly enough information. 

Overall, I have to say Andromeda isn't terrible as a game, so long as you go in expecting to have fun playing it rather than experiencing it. If you want good characters and a gripping story, play ME: Legendary Edition. If you just want to run around shooting things, play Andromeda. 6/10, buy on sale if possible.",1649563654,1649563654,True,1,0,0.506578981876373291,0,True,False,False

The gameplay and combat is nice, I picked biotics and physical for my combat abilities and had a great time with it. Zipping around a battlefield, sticking a grenade to some poor enemy, then dashing away is really fun. The only problem is that combat hardly comes up because this is an open world game, so most of the time is spent gathering resources, doing pointless fetch quests, and fighting small groups of weak enemies. It really is a shame that the gameplay was swept under the rug in favor of the exploration and narrative, both of which should take a back seat to the game. Combat abilities has gone from having 10 at the same time to 3, this isn't exactly a problem because it has you actually think about what you want to use in combat instead of having everything equipped at the same time.

I want to talk about my least favorite thing about this game, and that is the characters. This new group is too quippy and not serious enough to be the group that saves everybody. Commander Shepard and his team was very focused, determined, and by the books the whole game. The ONLY time anybody got extremely quippy was towards the end and the reason for that was because everybody knew each other as a team and had already been through so much. One companion starts cracking jokes on the first mission he goes out with you. This does not make for an interesting character; it makes him appear dumb and too relaxed. I actually FORGOT one of my companions names halfway through the story. The reason for this being is that they just kind of let themselves onto your team instead of giving you a choice. There was also a ridiculous side mission where everybody wants to get together for a ""movie night."" This one mission (despite being optional) really killed my perspective on the team. Everybody felt as if a break was needed despite there still being so much to do. Planets in this galaxy are harsh and the role of a pathfinder is to make it work for everybody; unfortunately for every colonist, the pathfinder decided he wants to kick back a bit and watch a movie. I still cannot understand the why to this. Shepard went to stop the geth and a reaper in Mass Effect 1, he didn't feel like he needed a break. He went to stop the collectors in Mass Effect 2, and still didn't need a break. The only time he took a break was in the third game, and even still he'd have rather been out fighting reapers. They felt as if their break was deserved; but in Andromeda, the team hasn't exactly done much to earn a break. 

Now onto the story, which is alright. Every planet has its own problems and the people struggle to adapt to each planet. The job of the pathfinder is to make Andromeda livable for all, and this is the basic gist of the story. Nothing really wrong with this, it's just a bit bland. Every bandit group that does want to kill you feels very samey in that sense, they all lack character which does not make for interesting opponents. The kett are fine in being samey because that is the whole idea behind them. The kett aren't meant to have character because they are subservient to the Archon. Them being bland makes it appear as if the Archon took all character from the to prevent rebellion and guarantee service. The kett interfere clash with every Milky Way race, trying to conquer and control them. I am okay with them being an enemy, the Archon just does a bit too much talking with his plans towards the end. He doesn't expose any of his weaknesses through talking, but there really is not reason for him to tell you anything. He really doesn't fall for any tricks, and he sees others as manipulable.

Can't talk about a game without mentioning the side content. This is very bland, some side quests aren't marked which means you have to roam around fighting very little and just drive for 15 hours looking for some irrelevant item for no other reason besides it's in your journal. Removing the kett on Eos was fine, fighting through a huge fort was quite fun just because of the sheer number of enemies. Good open world games let the gameplay shine, and this was true for about half the game.

Little tidbits I didn't want to make a whole wallpaper of text for: dialogue is alright, structured like Dragon Age where you can choose to be emotional, logical, serious, or humorous. Kind of wish the car had a gun like the Mako. Animations are often unskippable and just waste time. Added in the Assassin's Creed 4 system of waiting for resources and sending teams to go do things. The good thing about this is that unlike Dragon Age: Inquisition, this is not a requirement for some missions and just a passive way of making money and gathering resources. The story is also disconnected from the events of the trilogy, no mention of the genophage or reapers. Pretty sure this about covers it.

TL;DR: The game is okay, gameplay is the high point but it falls short with story, side content, and characters. If you liked Mass Effect 1 and Dragon Age, you'll probably be into this game. I only recommend this game because the gameplay is a high point of playing.

Being a part of the Andromeda Initiative, you are a few million lightyears away from the Milky Way, and close to 600-700 years in the future. You are a member of the Pathfinder team, whose job is to find a new home for the 20,000 humans that crossed dark space, just to prove that humanity can thrive anywhere. But Andromeda is not without it's own dangers and the area of your adventure, The Heleus Cluster, is filled with them, but maybe you can also find potential allies. Explore and customize your character, converse with multiple options and finally explore the Heleus Cluster to find a suitable home.

I really enjoy this game! I played it at least 2-3 times and I always end up coming back to it. When it first came out, it got a lot of bad rep, because of several reasons, and of course a lot of them made sense to me. But to me, the whole storyline and plot of this game, along with all the characters that you meet, make friends with and the places you explore, is so very much in the true essence, of the Mass Effect spirit. 

Of course, the Mass Effect-triology are on a completely different level, and few things can top these games. But ME:Andromeda is all about exploring, and it does not feel like you're in a race against the clock, you can take your time, learn as much as you can about the planets you come across. Even if the number you can visit is very limited, it does make for some exciting discoveries. The new race of aliens you encounter in Andromeda, along with the familiar ones that comes along for the ride. 

To me it's a solid 8/10. Would have loved to play some of the planned DLC's that sadly got scrapped (or maybe just put on the shelf, hopefully). Hope this review was useful, and if you have questions, just ask, and I'll do my best to answer!",1649248686,1649248686,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I managed to find a work around for the game breaking bug by fast traveling somewhere else on the map. The multiplayer is really fun, but it has its issues. Really bad connection issues, EA loot boxes determining if you advance your character, etc. So nothing out of the ordinary for an EA title. I recommend waiting for it to go on sale if you're on the fence. If you don't mind those or the awful character animations and love a good Mass Effect game, I recommend it.

TL;DR: Save your money. If you really want it, buy it on sale but be warned - its broken and you may never be able to finish the single player campaign due to bugs.

It breaks my heart to write this review because I am a HUGE Mass Effect fan. The story isn't bad, neither is the core game loop. It plays similar to the old ME games. Big main mission with side quests, loyalty missions, etc. That aspect is alright. The main issue is the technical issues. I can look past the awful character models/animations, the occasional weird visual/animation glitches and the like. But there are game-breaking bugs that will never be fixed. I'm almost 20 hours into single player and I can't continue due to an infinite loading screen bug. No saves fix it and no one has a solution for it. The multiplayer isn't terrible but paired with the games already pretty bad performance, it can be hit or miss. Save your money on this, I paid $5 for it on sale. It should not be sold on Steam due to it being actually unplayable, or at the very least a $5 game.",1641332500,1649006228,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am a huge fan of the original trilogy. Played them all ad nauseam, and will still play through them again in the future. I can say, I will never play this again, and mildly regret playing it in the first place.

My main complaints are about the characters being very... annoying. They didn't feel relatable, very one dimensional, and many an occasion more focused on their own feelings about themselves than anything going on in the story.

The story itself was very... lackluster. It had it's moments, but they were few and far between, but mostly lacked any real depth or feel of any consequence in any of your choices. Most involved a difference in who was in a later cutscene.

Regular gameplay was tedious, especially travel between planets. SAM needs an offswitch and will regularly inundate you with redundant and repetitive information. Crafting was alright, but once you figured out what was good, it turned into 'wait 10 levels to tear down and remake your gear all over again'. Resource gathering was tedious as well, until you quickly hit the point where you have enough to last the rest of the game without doing anything but breaking down any gear you find. Even the romance options felt crap, felt more like Cpt Kirk Simulator than anything.

The one big plus, I thought, was combat, it was definitely a step up over the previous games, and was honestly a bit of fun with jumping/hovering in conjunction with combos.

I can't recommend this game, unless you enjoy skipping nearly every conversation, looking to shag as many things with legs as possible, and don't mind rolling your eyes while spamming tab to skip planet to planet travel. looking to shag as many things with legs as possible. Sadly you don't get to skip system to system travel. Also, playing the game on low volume with other music playing can help override the need to jettison SAM or other team mates out the airlock due to their ambient conversations.

Honestly, last time I felt this way about a game was FFXIII. Great combat, but damn if the rest of it didn't suck.",1648944260,1648944420,False,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

-----------------------
- You don't really get to interact with a bunch of different races like in the first few games. You get to interact with like 3 races. You get to talk to MAYBE 3 Turians (My favorite race). And like maybe 2 or 3 Asari's. And again, like 2 Krogan. The rest are humans and a handful of Salarians and the Angara you see a good bit of. 

- The voice lines are awful. Like the worst npc reactions I've ever seen honestly. You could be like ""Your family just died"" and they'd be like ""Oh no.... Any way this here is a carbide repeater"" just awful

- The story line started off good, but it seems like they gave up on it about a fourth of the way in. It just got so weak 

- Also near the end of the story, there's a part that is so boring even though it's supposed to feel intense. But instead of feeling like you're on some awesome drive to defeat them, you literally just take a leisurely drive and have a tiny ship crash like 20 yards away from you every once in a while.

- Also I chose the undercut style haircut, and it gives you a rat tail. It looks gross as hell

- I did have a little bit of fun playing it

- I hated being forced to watch my ship land and depart every.single.time.

I bought Andromeda at a discount, and have now completed the main story. Approx 65 -70 hours in single player to complete all but 3 side quests. The rest in multiplayer. I would play more multiplayer but match-matching isn't that great. Though given the age of the game I did not have high expectations for many players still on. It still works at the time of writing, and is similar to ME: 3's multiplayer.

Characters simply aren't as expressive, quite frequently look incredibly derpy, and even basic things like how your character looks when running around in a hub area looks comically awkward.

The writing honestly isn't that impressive either. The bad guys seem painfully generic - its evil alien overlord #91823. You have seen this stuff before, so many times. Compared to how original and different the reapers were in ME1-3, this is a huge step backwards. No clue how Bioware could have dropped the ball on the writing so hard - all the problems with the game were supposed to be due to the new engine they were using, that shouldn't have compromised the writing! Even the final boss fight seemed incredibly lackluster, as if the real actual final boss fight was left out - that's certainly how I felt: You fight your way to the evil boss, clear three battle arenas to get him, expecting some final showdown with him? Right? No, its just... stops.

Compared to the other ME games, then this is by far the worst - even with ME3's shit ending.

I bought this game at a massive discount here on steam - I think it was 85% off or something. Do not pay any more than that for this game.

Unfortunately, Andromeda was the game that broke Bioware's backbone. As bad as the endings of ME 3 were, this game is on a whole different scale.

I can almost see a better Mass Effect game under all the bad writings, crazy poor character animations, unconvincing voice acting and gameplay bugs. Graphics are pretty good, more open world than previous titles, jumping and dashing are fun which added layers to game play mechanics and you almost want to scan every new stuff you encounter while exploring.

I can also see the push for SJW messages in the game, yeah it all started back around 2015-2016 as if all movie studios, TV shows, music industry, etc. received an ""Order 66"". You can see them right away in character creation - most of the presets are people of colour (POC) with SJW haircuts. I haven't ventured deep into story yet but, you can already find most commanding positions are held by POC females. Perhaps the writers forgot this will also make POC characters look bad when they are the bad guys.

I really liked the improvements made to the skill tree, in that it is very flexible. I loved the story and I hope that it gets continued in ME5 or in other media. 
I actually think that the Mass Effect TM might have hurt the game due to expectations. This is a good game. It IS very different that the OT. Whereas the OT is more a grand space opera similar to Star Wars or Halo, Andromeda is more like Star Trek.

I read some of the feedback for this game before I started playing, so I started with low expectations. I had played ME2 a long time ago, then ME3 and recently played ME1. I would give them all a 20 out of 10. Simply amazing and an experience that I have not had with any other game. I can't even say which of the 3 were better.

However, I can say that MEA is lower, but it may redeem itself by the time I finish the game. For the first 12 hrs of MEA I wasn't gravitating to playing. It felt like a chore. Why? It didn't feel like Mass Effect, it felt more like a new game called Andromeda using the Mass Effect engine. If that was the name, then I would have given it a 10/10 as it would be the best scifi space game I have ever played.

I then had to ask myself, what make Mass Effect so memorable in my mind? I don't normally play any FPS 3rd person shooter games. I think it comes down to: Fun Gameplay, Great storytelling, SciFi Space action, beautiful perfect - possibly genetically altered women that you can't help but fall in love with (&their personality), nightclub (never seen that in a game) , the amazing NPCs and companions, but most of all the amazing speeches that really make you feel like a Hero (speeches that draw awe like MLK & JFK).

In MEA you start off with everything falling apart, things don't seem to make sense (why does Ryder's father appear to have powers beyond normal), and the missions make you feel like you are just an errand boy.

But, it slowly progresses. At the 40hr mark, everything that didn't make sense or add up, actually had a reason/storyline. You start to become a hero and people treat you like it. The nightclub appears. The combat is enhanced - almost like being a Star Wars bounty hunter. The graphics is amazing. The Nomad / driving is more realistic and challenging. Overall I'm happy with it, I see all the hard work the developers put into the game and improving upon it. My one drawback / complaint would be that in the process of making it accessible to everyone, LGBTQ etc.., they seem to have forgotten or dropped the straight male that was the focus of the 1st 3 games in the series. Most of the women in the game are ugly in my opinion, we could do without the racoon look or the 12o'clock shadow.

Adding a DLC that allows you to change the look of  some of the characters/companions could make a big difference in my opinion, but that's me.

Mass Effect : Andromeda is one of those games for which I really wish there were a neutral option to review. At the same time it is a good game which fells just like previous Mass Effect games felt, while suffering from story inconsistencies and minor bugs. It’s one of those games where you should be annoyed at but you are having fun anyway. 

[h1]Long Version [/h1]

[b]Gameplay [/b] 
The gameplay is very similar to previous Mass Effect games. Bioware have taken an already good formula and polished it. This is probably the only aspect of the game where I haven’t encountered any problems. You will also encounter know aspects from previous Mass effect games – like Maco exploration, traveling around the universe and probing planets, mining zones and so on. 
Unlike previous games crafting is the way to obtain the best weapons in the game. Nothing found is really worth it because during crafting you can add special modifications which cannot but put in any other way. Credits are mostly used for consumables. I guess it does make sense that from a story point view that crafting is better than trading but it kinda robs you from the fun of exploration knowing that whatever you find it will be crap. There is also the feature I hate most in RPGs – enemy scaling. Because you can craft new tier of weapons every 10 levels that causes a serious balance swings around those levels – You are much stronger at level 51 than at level 59. Than strong at 61 and getting weaker towards 60 and so on. 
[b]Story [/b]
The story and the world building are subpar to the original Mass Effect ones. There are many inconsistencies both in the world and in the story. It is also plain obvious that the game is written with a second instalment in mind which perhaps will fill those gaps but it seems very unlikely that we will get one. Many choices have obvious short term benefits vs long term consequences. There are also minor annoying things like NPC’s talking about planets you haven’t yet discovered for example. 
MA:E companions not very interesting compared to original trilogy. Although perhaps I’m judging too hard because I only remember good ones like Tali, Liara, Garrus compared to bland ones like Kaidan or whatever the female soldier from ME1 was called. 
There are also only 2 new races and many of the others are missing – Only Salarians, Asari, Human, Turian or Krogan are available. 

[b]Technical [/b] 
After 10 patches most of the game breaking bugs are fixed but there are still some minor annoying likes like missing waypoints or enemies stuck in the environment. Perhaps the most obvious and annoying technical issue is the lack of graphical models for Asari and Angara (one of the new races). All of them look the same with some make up and it shows. It’s like someone said – we are releasing in 2 weeks do something and they just rolled with it.

[b]Price and DLC’s[/b] The game goes regularly on super sales for like 90% discount. It was even free at some point.

Graphics: nice visuals with too much lens flare. Some locations are genuinely stunning and deeply impressive. I particularly enjoyed the desert planet Elaanden

Gameplay: you can swap which shoulder you aim over!! Still can't hot-swap weapons, but get drop-pods that let you switch things up on site. And you have a boost-pack, which greatly aids mobility and opens up fun new combat strategies. You unlock planet-fixing machines via alien sudoku. For real.
No morality system, and few major choices to make. This makes the whole game feel much more relaxed than the original trilogy, which I greatly appreciated

Full character respec (face, colours and skills) is available in the Tempest med bay, and is super-cheap. This game actively wants you to experiment

I believe it combines a lot of aspects of what was good in the other games and makes this one great! Think about the idea of taking an entire fleet of people and sending them to a completely different galaxy, you then need to make every planet you try and inhabit livable for countless people. To make each planet viable for survival you have to fight off nasty creatures that have some pretty good combat code which makes the early stages of the game pretty challenging on max difficulty. Also every planet has a set of puzzles you must solve or resolve to cultivate the viability of the planet, these puzzles are super fun to figure out and at some points left me quite stumped, but then when I conquered them I felt very satisfied! (hope you like sudoku!) the relationship development in the game was similar to the other mass effects. Love the ability leveling system and class development and overall customization you can obtain. Overall a pretty fun experience that feels quite rewarding when you cultivate a new planet and make it safe for your people!

A couple of glitches that I could never overcome. 

From the start I was never able to access the online content, beat the whole game without it.

Bout half way through the game my char. became transparent and his tongue dropped all the way to the floor and looked like exploding puddy, it was always like that even with my gear on so my tongue always had a good sense of what the floor tasted like wherever i went.

the grappling could have been a lot better, i fell of the map quite a few times because of its quirkiness.

> insufficient stealth elements
> overly scripted
> disappointing gunplay

I was never able to enjoy or get into Mass Effect games, as I prefer the RPG shooter game type: Bioshock, Deus Ex, System Shock, Dishonored, Prey, etc. I usually don't much like 3rd person games either, but was able to make exceptions for Witcher 3 and the Star Wars Battlefront games. I saw from the reviews that hardcore ME fans don't like this game, which gave me some hope that I would since Andromeda lets you aim/shoot without turn-based rules. I also wanted to experience more of the ME universe/lore, and the fact the game runs on Frostbite further upped my anticipation for a single-player campaign.

My biggest issue is the movement and cover system, which totally kills the game for me because it limits how the player can move and approach a situation. It's not as simple as blaming this on the forced third-person perspective, because I can enjoy other games that require it. IMO this game is more about standing fully upright behind a nearby cover object, sweeping left to right to find gaps in cover where you can hit an enemy. You can't do much of anything to really leverage your cover, which is exacerbated further by the forced 3rd-person perspective. From this angle you really don't know just how much you are exposed to the enemy, and then the heavy scripting of the conflict events takes over. Playing this game feels like I'm being shoved into a tiny little box without enough freedom to act. 

Bottom line, I found that Mass Effect Andromeda just isn't fun because the game design places too many restrictions on movement/combat. The gameplay is more about forcing you into scripted events while eliminating your options for stealth or marksman play styles.",1647717194,1647718204,False,1,0,0.498150438070297241,0,True,False,False

Exploring new planets and settling outposts is a blast.

Let me start with the good; it's a pretty big game. Lots of places to go, things to do, building, customization etc. Lots of replay value. If you are familiar with Mass Effect then it will all make sense. You have your basic classes, as somewhat long intro to familiarize you with everything and then off you go.

Now for everything else:

The first Mass Effect was sort of like being in your own little action movie. This one is more like all the other games they've produced of late, the whole ""our leader died and everyone is looking up to you!"" now rebuild the fleet which has been lost/smashed/crashed all over the place.

Remember all the noise about poor facial animations when it first came out? I thought that was just noise until an Asari chick jumped on top of my character with a stoned look on her face. 

Optimization isn't that great. Weird framerate dives on some planets or in areas where you cannot figure out why it went down. It also seems to be a hog for system resources even though it doesn't look ""that great"". I understood Witcher 3 being a hog on release because it looked amazing but this game? Nope.

And one final peeve...romance. It seems they decided to have all sorts of options for every race, class, sex, whatever. Shoehorn them all in. Wanna make a female character and bang a monster? Have at it! I honestly do not know what they were thinking.

In the beginning I thought the characters were cringe and annoying but a few like peebee drack and jaal really grew on me and I'd even consider them on the level of some of the normandy crew. Although I still think Liam is the worst character bioware ever wrote. The story is ok with some really good moments. The mission to save the asari ark and the last mission have the ME DNA in them which unfortunately isn't felt a whole lot throughout this game. Also its sad we didn't get any DLC for this game because there are a few loose ends that could've made for really compelling stories. The gameplay is fun, the verticality in movement and flexibility of different builds keep it interesting enough throughout, although towards the end when i was burned out by this game i just opted for a charge/nova/throw build with vanguard profile and it made the game a cake walk on hardcore difficulty. Sadly for some reason this game is structured like an MMO where you can't go two seconds without pulling endless mobs, which sometimes stops you from enjoying the beautiful environments.

Why can't i skip them?!? I digress. Another annoyance is that you can't access your ship and its facilities after landing on a planet, so make sure you've finished EVERYTHING on board, because to get back on board the ship has to take off back into space for you be able to move around in there. You complete a mission on a planet and if it says go and meet someone on your ship by video call, if you want to do that it means you're gonna get on the ship, go through a takeoff cutscene, do the video call and find out the next assignment then if you decide you wanna stay and play other missions on that planet you have to go back and go through a landing cutscene to do that. so what ends up happening is that if it says go to your ship for further instructions you just end up switching to another mission on planet.

There is a scene where character Reyes Vidal is searching through Sloane Kelly's belongings looking for a bottle of some old liquor and he gets caught by Pathfinder Ryder, who was looking for him after he left him at a party they were attending together (naturally under the guise of two lovers, the only choice you get). Vidal cautions the pathfinder that someone is coming and a icon pops up for you to create a distraction by right clicking, and the only choice is to kiss. I almost puked. Really, the game programmers are obviously twinks but do you really have to persist with forcing the world to accept that this is normal? Countless conversations contain choices for gay interaction.

Everything in this game is a maze and you can't just go in one direction to get to a point indicated by a quest icon, because there might be walls or several levels of construction to navigate, or a mountain in your way, and you have to travel a long way to find a way to get over it. Some quest items can not be reached or are half buried in some object that you can't interact with.

I've finished the game, which is a weird thing to say because the game itself feels unfinished. I take back what I said about it not being worth more than $45; it's not worth more than $20, and I still feel like I overpaid by $5. Andromeda ends with several MAJOR plot points left unresolved, and every single one of those plot points are the only truly interesting bits of the game. I guess they were gouged out with the intention that they'd be released as DLC, but it leaves the game feeling like a total hackjob.

If nothing else, you should play ME:A to get insight into how EA/Bioware operates. To say that whoever was the project manager on this product was incompetent would not even begin to scratch the surface. Annoying bugs aside, this game fails at the basics of storytelling. Player characters are bland and constantly need to be reminded that they're the saviour by the supporting cast. When the storytelling starts to get interesting, it usually leads to a dead-end.

This game has a lot of really neat ideas. Unfortunately, when those really neat ideas were cobbled together, they made for an objectively forgettable package. I think DLC to clean up the four or five MASSIVE plot points could redeem it. But there's no motivation for EA to make it. No one is going to spend $15-$20 on four or five piecemeal DLCs for this game, half of which should have been part of the main content in the first place.

I can't believe some people actually paid $50+ for Mass Effect: Andromeda on release.

ORIGINAL REVIEW
Only about 1/3 of the way through at the time of writing this. I would recommend it if you get it on sale, but be aware that it still has quite a few bugs. So far they've been more annoying than game breaking.

I'm playing as male Ryder who has the personality of a door, so for the first good while he's boring af. From what I've heard the Sara experience isn't much better.

The gameplay style doesn't feel like a Mass Effect game, and I'm not sure why. The ""feel"" kind of reminds me of the Anthem trailers tbh. Choices don't really feel like they matter. I only remember getting like one or two quick-time events; they also don't seem to actually affect the story. The Tempest is okay, but it's no Normandy. Aside from Liam and Cora, the companion stories so far have been pretty dull. There is, however, enough to do and none of it feels overly-grindy. I enjoy building up the colonies, and researching things, etc.

In all, it's not as bad as all of the moistmouth YouTubers painted it out to be. But it sure as heck isn't worth paying more than $45. I'd say $20 is a decent sale price to pick it up at. It could use some (good) DLC.",1614738730,1647022851,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The Tempest crew really feels like a family (it feels a lot more casual than the Normandy crew), through all the interactions on the ship like the ambient conversations and the message board, as well as all the banter in the Nomad which is always entertaining.

Does it have a lot of flaws, like a needless open world, a weird face problem, and a somewhat bungled premise? Yes.

But do I still recommend it? Yeah probably. The new gameplay/gunplay loop is pretty good. Getting to switch your ability loadout on the fly is a ton of fun. And while the story is inconsistent, I was interested in it. And the last mission was pretty solid. The companions were also well done, easily on par with ME1s companions (if you ignore ME2 and 3, which only seems fair). 

The flaws are serious enough that I probably won't play it again for years, if ever. And if I do, it'll be with serious mods. BUT I don't regret playing it either.

It's a spin off, set in the Mass Effect universe, with gun play, a lovely cast of new companions, a large galaxy to explore and a real sense of adventure. Awkward animations and bugs from the release have been long fixed and I had no technical issues whatsoever.

There was no reason to start with so much hate campaign, every game now this days that comes out and possibly due to dead lines has bugs on release.

It's a very enjoyable game and has lived up to my expectations.

Single player campaign for story 8/10, with mods for fixing some story quest bugs to be able to actually play them 10/10
Single player replayability aspect 10/10
Multi Player 10/10

It gets a lot of criticism for its story being not very good, but (1) I don't care about that because it's a video game, if I want a good story I'll read sci-fi; and (2) honestly the story in the original ME trilogy is not a whole lot better. These are entirely subjective viewpoints so you can take them or leave them. The only common Andromeda criticism I agree with is that it can be buggy at times.

Where this ME shines is its gameplay. Fighting in this one is more fun than in the other games; there's a lot more variety of play styles and customization options for your weapons and your build, and fighting is more dynamic. I played through the original Mass Effect trilogy once as a sniper-oriented Infiltrator and once as a charge- and shotgun-oriented Vanguard, and both get repetitive; with the infiltrator you get to cover, tactical cloak, headshot someone, and go back to cover; and with the Vanguard you charge, nova, shotgun, rinse and repeat. In Andromeda, on the other hand, a lot of fights encourage you to run around and to try different things (at least until you figure out that a Shadow sniper rifle and Dhan shotgun will get you through every situation -- hey, you didn't hear it from me). 

The other big aspect of the gameplay that improves upon the original trilogy is exploration. In Andromeda you really feel like you're exploring and finding stuff; it brings back the driving-around-planets aspect from ME1, but in Andromeda the places you drive around actually have stuff to do and find, as opposed to ME1 where you spend 90% of your time driving around empty barren wastelands. 

One minor but very satisfying improvement over the original trilogy: the button for skipping dialogue is no longer the same button that you use for selecting a response. I can't even count how many times in the original trilogy I try to press space/E to skip some dialogue (because I play with subtitles on and usually can read the subtitles faster than the voice acting says the line) and end up accidentally picking some response (this especially happens all the time in ME2 with Garrus's famous calibrations). At worst, I sometimes would pick an option with drastic consequences and need to go back to an earlier save; at best, it's an annoyance having to redo the same part of a conversation tree over again. Anyway in Andromeda skipping dialogue is a separate button and so this problem never happens. Like I said, it's just a small adjustment but it's a major quality-of-life improvement.

One problem that Andromeda shares with the original trilogy (and perhaps is even worse at) is that load times in between systems or areas can get annoying. I usually want to do everything I can on one planet in one swoop, without going back and forth, because I dread having to wait 15 seconds or whatever on a glorified load screen every time I need to go back to the Nexus. All Mass Effect games have this problem to some extent (at least in ME1 the obnoxiously long elevator sequences were sometimes charming), but I feel like I notice it the most in Andromeda. Ultimately the most terrifying enemy in the game is not Architects or Ascendants or even the Progenitor; it's the load screen you get traveling in between systems or in and out of the Nexus.

Other legitimate criticisms are that the game gets buggy at times (e.g. NPCs that you need to talk to getting stuck in corners where you can't talk to them, your character getting stuck inside a wall in the middle of combat, stuff like that), and some of the later worlds feel more empty and barren a la ME1 (e.g. the first outpost you get is full of missions and loot and stuff to do, but the last two are just a bunch of buildings with basically nothing in them).

Combat was pretty good, skills tree were fleshed out. You can build your Ryder to your hearts content. The amount of weapons and armor felt overwhelming, yet I only used 2 weapons and the same armor the entire game. Never felt the urge to swap anything out.

Even if i purchased the game at late 2021 and thus has been updated from 2017 to its recent state , i would say that the game it is overall good.

The graphics are modern and realistic. The overall sound effects are nice. The story is interesting at one point , but it takes a lot back-and-forth to Nexus and other worlds in order to proceed. The gameplay mechanics are satisfying , the gun play is OK and the character customization is competent (not that deep, not that shalow).

My POV was from the start to actually review the game as a unique experience and not to compare it with the previous trilogy. It is fair to do as such, because EA also released it as a separate experience and not as a sequel.

Though , as i said, i am reviewing the game at its CURRENT state and not at day 1 release. Probably the review would be worst. But as it is right now , i am confident to say that i loved the game, i am enjoying it and i would recommend it to everybody that are looking for a separate ME experience. Also by purchasing it i would like to support Bioware , because i know from older reviews that they got really stressed in order to release it in EA's time schedule and moreover they had their budget cut from EA in order to provide a deep and better experience.

* New species to meet and a non Reaper focused story line
* Gunplay and combat in general is among the best of Mass Effect
* Some interesting new characters, perhaps best compared to the ME1 lineup
* Real sense of accomplishment in exploring worlds, restoring their biospheres and building the initiative
* Mako is back and it is fabulous this time

The main story is a bit uninspired, but it's serviceable.The quality of the character writing for squad mates is on par for most if it doesn't exceed for some. I found some of the crew mates a bit insufferable, but who likes all their co-workers all the time, right?

[MINOR SPOILER] Of all the mechanics, I found increasing the viability of colonies surprisingly enjoyable. When the rest of the game slogged for a bit, that kept me going.

Regarding the lack of polish, the worst problems are some odd animations at times which can break the immersion a bit. I remember being very impressed with the facial expressions in ME1, but there's something off about the facial expression of the humans in this game. It may be some sort of uncanny valley issue. The non-humans didn't bother me much at all, even the ones that are more human-like. Second, bits of dialogue are weirdly cut-off. Usually, it's just color commentary, but there's not really any warning it's going to happen. You're driving around a planet, a crew mate begins commenting on something, but you drive too fast past a certain point, and they just get cut off leaving you wondering what they were going to say. I'm sure I didn't miss anything vital to the story, but it happened often enough to be jarring and irritating.

Finally, a word about the multiplayer. The multiplayer in ME3 was probably my favorite multiplayer mode in any game ever. I dumped hours and hours into it. The multiplayer in MA:A is just slightly worse and unpolished just like the rest of the game. I enjoyed it well enough, but the platforming mechanic just made me think about how much more polished ME3 was.

Pros:
-Solid game play even if a bit unpolished.
-Excellent character and world building.
-Fun ""big-picture"" game play mechanics.
-I liked the paragon/renegade dichotomy of the previous games, but the dialog wheel split between emotional, logical, professional, and casual was a refreshing change. I get the impression that choices were largely inconsequential, but it did make it easier to role-play.
-Relatively fun mutliplayer.

Cons:
-So-so main story line.
-They set it in entirely new galaxy only to re-use all the same alien species with two exceptions.
-Way too unpolished for a AAA game.
-Weird, uncanny valley human facial expressions.
-Perhaps a bit longer than it needed to be, but that only just makes the cons list. I'm old now and prefer shorter, tighter game play and story these days.

Mass Effect Andromeda is a game of polar opposites.  It has some brilliant moments as good or better than any  other Mass Effect game.  Unfortunately the fun is killed by dull and pointless open world gameplay.  

The good: 
- The dedicated, unique missions are a blast.  Overall, the combat is super smooth and enjoyable. 
- The developers put in a lot of effort into the character models and facial expressions.  They got a lot of flak for some of these that are not perfect.  But, I think it is an amazing part of the game.  The off-beat character expressions give real feeling to the game.  And the character models that don't look like super models are a big win in my book. 
- Hey, the developers added mission markers.  Wow!  Mass Effect 3 made me want to puke for running in circles looking for your mission objective (specifically citadel station). 
- The worlds and scenery look amazing.  Really beautiful.  Pity the worlds are so large and repetitive. 

The bad: 
- Lots of pointless interactions with once-off npcs.  I really don't understand what was the point of adding so many dead-end interactions?   I skipped through most of the conversations in this game - it is so lame. 
- The game has many unskipable transition videos.  Painful and pointless.  At least they are short.  But you have to sit through so many of these. 
- What is the point of the research and crafting systems other than to waste time? 

The ugly: 
- Lots of game bugs. 
- Poor optimisation problems hit me around the middle of the game - causing overheating.  Then it disappeared towards the later part of the game? 
- Pointless and repetitive open-world gameplay.  If this game was 50 hours shorter it could have been an amazing 9 out of 10 game. 
- Related to the open world comment.  It feels like 80% of the game is fighting copy-paste enemies at copy-paste locations.  Really not cool. 

Gameplay tips:
- If you play this game, you will want to minimise time wasting. 
- Do not pick up minerals and do not mine minerals - it is a total pointless time waste.  Get minerals by breaking down unwanted weapons and armour.  You can do this in the field. 
- Make money by selling scrap and unwanted weapon mods.  You are going to swim in credits. 
- You can recycle the weapons and armour you crafted, which will return the mods you used to craft the equipment.  
- Standard difficulty is too easy, even for a casual gamer like me. 
- You can ride around that copy paste enemy camp.  You are just going to fight copy-paste enemies there anyway.",1645475230,1645475230,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For instance: you can only talk to characters if you're facing them, and if you meet a character like the doctor in the Kadara slums who lives in a box, you're stuck waiting for him to turn around. Or menus where you have to click the Back button 4 times before you exit instead of just having one convenient Exit button in each screen. Etc.

I want to say something about Ryder. I liked the main character, and I can see what they tried to do - make him/her as different from Shepard as possible. However, I do think Ryder can come across as a goofball too much. Like, I wouldn't trust Ryder to park my car, let alone lead an expedition that the fate of the humankind depends on. Still liked Ryder, still had fun playing Ryder, but they weren't able to sell Ryder to me as THE Pathfinder, especially when there are much more complex characters in the game that could have easily done the job.

There's a lot of dialogue in this game. Kudos to the writers. Some of it has zero impact, however. Here's what I mean:

Ryder finds some looters pick pocketing a dead body (reference to Shepard?). Options are, tell the looters off  or let them be. You tell them off. Looters are like, ""Nah, I don't think so!"" SAM (your implant) is like, ""Shouldn't antagonize the bad guys, Ryder!"" To which Ryder is like, ""Nothing I can do here, better go."" 

OK, WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT CONVERSATION? Just to prove that Ryder is not Shepard? Trust me, it was painfully obvious already.

I HIGHLY recommend NOT doing too many side quests of the type Gather 10 Mushrooms. They will suck the living joy out of this game. Focus on the main story. 

I still think it's a game worth playing. Just don't take it too seriously and definitely don't think of it as the spiritual successor of the original trilogy, because it's not.",1643381409,1645393455,True,3,0,0.537551760673522949,0,True,False,False

The story grabbed me from the minute it began and it just kept getting better. I loved how there were Easter eggs throughout the game - both for the OT and for Dragon Age, but they never felt out of place or awkward.

The combat is amazing. The worlds are beautiful. The characters are fleshed out and interesting from the get-go. The story (even with a few key moments hearkening back a bit too much to the trilogy) is really good. In fact, the game has one of the few lines from a bad guy that actually made me want to throw things. Smug bad guys are absolutely infuriating.

As much as I enjoyed the Paragon vs Renegade options in the OT, the dialogue wheel in Andromeda felt a lot more organic - and the Renegade style options that do exist feel absolutely in character to pick - even if you have a super chill Ryder.

I did all the romances at least once (Jaal, Gil, Reyes, and Vetra are the ones I end up repeating) and the worst thing I can say about any of them is that Bioware really needs to put the same amount of effort into each romance that they did with Cora and Jaal - because you really notice the difference. I still love the others but Jaal and Cora have significantly more content and infinitely more detailed romance scenes than any one else.

I can not stress enough how much fun the combat is. Between jump jets and the ability to switch profiles on the fly, I never stopped having fun with it. Not being locked into one fighting style just made fighting so much more interesting and challenging. If I felt something was too easy or hard, I could switch accordingly to a different profile that kept things fresh.

I do have a few gripes, but they're not game breaking. There are key moments where the game feels TOO much like the OT. The writers manage to make it their own, but odds are you'll know exactly what I'm talking about when you get there.

There are a couple lines that make me facepalm - I mean....come on ""My face is tired""??? I mean, yeah - I can relate to the sentiment but who actually says that? The makeup on the feminine characters can be down right bizarre. It's almost like someone handed a 4 year old a makeup palette and said ""go ham."" The 70's called and they want their looks back. :P

Animations can get a bit weird here and there - like when you first meet Jaal and are walking with him - that posture...just oof. The trilogy had those moments, too, though, so I just shrug it off as a ""typical Bioware"" thing - although Dragon Age Inquisition proved that Bioware can do animation brilliantly without fail, in all aspects - so here's hoping the next game steals from them. <3 

My biggest issue is the hinted at DLC that just never came. We still need it - so hopefully the next game addresses those moments. :)",1645284449,1645284806,True,1,0,0.508928596973419189,0,True,False,False
1238000,110538048,76561198061865035,0,9,4478,0,4478,1636773455,"TL;DR: Characters are well written. Everything else feels like pulling teeth.

I have tried so very hard to enjoy this game, but it's just not good. And not because, ""The faces are so bad,"" or whatever, because honestly any problems with the faces aren't as bad or noticeable as people act. However, there are so many other things that are far worse than people say.

Before I start with the negatives, I do want to say the character writing in this game is p fucking good! All of the characters feel like their own people! For example, Cora is a biotic fighter, trained by asari commandos, who was supposed to be in charge, but instead you are. The entire game there's this tension where she doesn't want you to feel like you have to prove yourself to her, but she can't help but feel hurt because she got stiffed out of the leadership role by your dad's nepotism. It's an cool dynamic you can have with her, and nearly all characters have just as interesting dynamics!

That being said, in no particular order, here are the things that suck:

1) The controls are stiff as a board, and the way your character moves is atrocious. This game is bad on its own merits, so this will be the only time I bring up the original trilogy, but boot up any of the previous ME games, and run around for a bit, then try moving in this game and feel how sluggish it is, comparatively. And that's not to mention how terrible the camera is in Andromeda. It's all just off kilter and looks and feels bad.

2) The combat system sucks ostrich eggs. The powers somehow feel bland and the different groups all consist of the same 5 kinds of enemies (the cannon fodder, the one with shields, the one with barriers, the tank, and the boss). Also, you have a jump jet that allows you to reach high places, but it seems the designers didn't know what to do with that, so the maps feel like they're slapped together. Speaking of maps...

3) The maps and different worlds are garbage! Nothing is balanced right, so where you're positioned in combat doesn't matter. The multiplayer maps are a jumbled mess and feels like they realized at the last second, ""Oh yeah, the players can jump,"" so they just aren't fun. For the single player worlds, despite all looking vastly different, all have the same 3 kinds of locations, with nothing truly unique with any of them, so they feel the exact same.

4) There are really only 2 difficulties. Despite the fact that it says there are 5, really there's only ""The Enemies Die in Two Hits"" or ""You Die in Two Hits"". There's really nothing else.

5) Inventory management is the worst I've ever seen. You can't equip new items you get right away, and you can't compare items to eachother; only to what you have equipped. Not that comparing items helps much, because every gun has its own quirks that the stats don't tell you about, and you can't see base stats when you have mods or augmentations on something. So good luck figuring out what's good!

6) The UI is terrible. They focused so much on trying to make it look sleek, that they didn't bother making it look or feel good. Also, there's this bug so no matter what you do the Codex menu will always flash, even when there are no new entries. It is annoying as all hell and there's no way to get rid of it.

There's probably more I could bring up, but I've run out of energy to care. Don't play this game.",1645247755,1645247755,False,37,5,0.647211015224456787,0,True,False,False

If you're still thinking about this game after the fiasco or if you just want more Mass Effect -- please give Andromeda a try.

After finishing the other BioWare debacle, Dragon Age: Inquisition, I needed to see what was Andromeda's thing all about. I knew it wasn't very well received just like DA:I but my curiosity was once again stronger than me and I am very glad I took the chance on this game.

I used these mods:

[*] Quick Loot (All in One)
[*] Fast Mining
[*] Profiles Reworked
[*] Road Rage
[*] Fast Kadara Doors
[*] ME:A Fix Pack
[*] Powers Boosted and Balanced 1 & 2
[*] Skill Points Version G
[*] Beeg Inventory
[*] Romance for All
[*] Better Squadmates
[*] Shorter Landing and Departure Cinematic
[*] Hyper Mobility (Super jump and faster sprinting animations)
[*] Balanced Guns
[*] Weapon Bullet Hit and Range
[*] Melee Weapon Boost
[*] Increased Player Stats and 2x EXP points
[*] Camera Mod
[*] Better Grey Market Connections
[*] Nomad Top Speed
[*] Better Lab Technicians
[*] And finally, some cosmetic mods.
[/list]

Yup, that's a long ass list but it made my experience super engaging as you can see by how long it took me to do everything I wanted to do in the game.

I played as fem Ryder and finished every single affinity sidequest, even the ones not involving my teammates. I rescued all the arks, opened all the vaults (and unfortunately didn't get the Cryptographer achievement because I missed out on some containers) and got every single memory thingy for my Ryder.

I gotta say, the main quest is boring and predictable. The main villain, Archon, is a bit of a knob and stays hidden for the most part. This game feels like a saturday morning ME spin-off and if you treat is as such, it's going to be enjoyable. The future of the races is in your hands... kind of, Pathfinder. Murder the Kett! Geth? No, no. These are Kett! This Archon dude wants to wreck your shiz because why not. That's it, lets talk about the characters:

For me, the most important part of the game was my crew. I LOVE these characters and Vetra is by far my favourite. Such a well written turian character, with traumas that are relatable. She just wants to keep her sister Sid and everyone else she loves safe. Vetra Nyx was my choice for romance, even though I also romanced two other women (and I missed out on Suvi because to be with her you can't shoot for everyone; dang you monogamy) Vetra was the one who made my heart melt.

Peebee was my other romance and she is a LOT. Very reminiscent of Sera from DA:I but with much better footing and oozing charisma. She definitely has ADHD because she doesn't stop ONE SECOND. Hits a lil bit close to home but maybe that's why I enjoyed her company. She is flirty, a proper wild soul and her storyline can be a bit of a mess but it has a couple strong, emotional moments.

Drack... the old man has some baggage, over a thousand years of experience and a lot of sass. I enjoyed Drack for what he was but god, it did feel somewhat similar to Wrex, even some of the rougher choices later on the game. I however can't really compare both because Wrex had three games containing backstory and Drack only has this one but still, I wish they knew how to write krogans somewhat different than our boi Wrexy.

Liam sucks. He is the worst character in this game and a serious candidate for the worst in the series, maybe not as charismatic than Vega but definitely not as boring as Jacob. Liam is childish, he tries too hard to fit in and I couldn't care less about him in the slightest. He butts heads with everybody and judges the crew with zero basis whatsoever. I wish I could just throw him away but he has the funniest affinity mission with very well done comedic timing. My Ryder is very sarcastic and casual but, with this dude, I drew the line. Definitely proceed with caution with Liam.

Cora is the perfect military partner, in my honest opinion. She's the much better Ashley AND with zero racism! She tries very hard to deal with how life treats her, especially after unfolding the events of the beginning of the game. She treats Ryder with utmost respect and she's a sweetheart. Her sidemission with the asari commandos is super emotional and I highly recommend it. Also all she wants is to have and take care of her own garden! How can you not find that wonderful?

Jaal... oh Jaal. The angara species are such a wonderful concept but Jaal's writing is extremely inconsistent. He fails to understand idioms but he is also very sarcastic when needed to be. He is stern but not really, easy going and cheerful and suddenly emotional. Jaal is all over the place, which makes me think -- is his writing just a bunch of people winging it and not revising anything or is Jaal just f**king with me the entire time? I think the former because I'd be giving the writers too much credit. Definitely do Jaal's quests because even though he is tough to read, he is very relatable too and will touch your heartstrings with everything he has. Also, what a voice.

Suvi, Lexi, Kallo and Gil are four great characters for what they are. I wish Suvi had more character development but whoever decided to make a salarian the pilot deserves a lot of praise. What a wonderful character Kallo is and his feud with Gil is seriously amazing, please do yourself a favour and chat with them a lot about it. Lexi is a very by the rules doctor but talking to her reveals such a touching side to the doc. Gil's sidequest took a crazy turn and I cannot spoil for you guys. Just don't miss out on these characters, they're worth it.

Now, Ryder... well, they're definitely not Shepard and they're not trying to be. They were thrown into the role of Pathfinder and now they gotta do what they can. I didn't hate how much of a slow burn the first few hours are but there are some selection of choices you can make with your Ryder in regards to their family that really piqued my interest -- how emotionally unavailable their father was and how much they resent their dad. I loved how it was written because it hits home to lose someone so soon and not feel much of grief, or not knowing how to deal with it. Their sibling having a lil bit of screentime made me happy. You can see how much they care about each other (not in the Alabama way.)

Now for the rest of Mass Effect Andromeda's features: The combat is spectacular, it feels fluid and the weapons + powers with mods feel extremely rewarding. Also I was super overpowered but you get the idea. Charge is HILARIOUS.

Sidequests can be painfully BORING because they make you jump from planet to planet for no dang reason. I just finished a quest in Kadara but hey go to Elaaden just because. Come on, this feels very MMORPG-esque and it made me groan every time. Do all of them, however, if you're interested in the lore as I was and the background of the characters. I feel these quests kind of get forgotten because of how annoying having to constantly watch the Tempest take flight and land... god. But yes, the world of Andromeda is definitely worth exploring and the only thing I wish I could've done was put a bullet in Reyes' head, other than that I enjoyed this game more than I thought I would and I hope you do to.

In general, the achievements can be stupid to get (Strike Team Missions) so I didn't go full force but, I did a lot of them and had fun even with the weird ass Hang Time (use a controller for that one). Do the Fastball one, it's funny as hell.

To finish it, I will miss Vetra and I hope they let us play as different races in the next Mass Effect. My GOD I love the turians so much. Put your two favourites and spend time just exploring the planets driving the Nomad and they will interact a lot. I was always riding with my two girlfriends, the spiky one and the carefree one and they are hilarious. 

Play this game with mods; maybe not as many as me but give this game a chance. It deserves it for the characters alone.",1644711041,1645032830,True,46,1,0.782298028469085693,0,True,False,False

Given my fascination with science fiction and space, a story centred on exploring the unknown with its challenges sounded appealing. While reviews were not wholly kind in critiquing game glitches and commenting on other issues, a hefty discount on Steam was enough motivation for me to invest in the story and see what it was really like. Ultimately, I was not surprised by my experience.

The general summary of this game is that you represent the son or daughter of an explorer tasked with leading thousands of individuals to another galaxy. Naturally, not everything goes according to plan, and ultimately the role of Pathfinder is thrust upon your character. It becomes your responsibility to explore this new galaxy and find a home for your people. The situation becomes more complicated when you learn of fanatical aliens, the Kett, who promptly attack your group and establish themselves as the story’s villains.

My number one criticism of this game, and why I ultimately chose to stop playing it after around 12 hours of gameplay, is that it does not do anything new. The game follows other AAA titles in presenting an expansive sandbox for the player. There are copious amounts of missions, items to unlock, relationships with crew members to develop, and planets to terraform to occupy a motivated player for likely hundreds of hours. The story asserts a sense of purpose towards the protagonist’s actions that could motivate one to see the story through and do their part for one’s virtual companions.
However, so much of this has been done ad nauseam in other games, and there was nothing special about this iteration of the sandbox formula. Aside from attempting to discover what happened to the other arks, the large ships that carried other alien species from the Milky way, many of the side missions were forgettable and not engaging. They involved the copy-paste go here and do this and receive a 10-second update on how doing the said action arguably made a difference in another person’s life. While the impact of these missions had evident and apparent weight, the emotional weight was lacking, making them lacklustre.

The main story’s missions had more emotional weight, hence why I played the game for so long and reached around 25% game completion. I found exploring the unknown and providing hope for a people quite inspiring and something that I found satisfying. However, over time, the emotional weight of these missions dissipated. After establishing the first human outpost, missions shifted towards changing planets to create other outposts. While the storyline attempted to keep my attention by bringing in another alien species and showcasing the horror done by the Kett, the pacing was off and left me just wanting to get to the next main event, which tended to be offset by unskippable loading screens and the copious amount of other material that acted to dilute the promise in the game.

Just as with books, the emotional interactions between characters is part of what gets me engaged in a game’s story. For the companions of the protagonist, this was a well-developed system. Like with the missions, it was unfortunately diluted by the copious amounts of other characters one has to interact with within the game that are forgettable and draw attention away from the game’s positive aspects.

There were other issues. Scrolling around the Universe had an awkward angle. One needs to use a scanner on occasion to progress, a mechanic that is used just enough to forget that you have it and get frustrated trying to figure out how to progress. Many mechanics are not introduced, and you struggle to learn how to do things required for progression. While these points were frustrating, ultimately, the dilution of the story caused me to put my controller away and say goodbye to the game.

Mass Effect Andromeda is not a bad game. It is not a good game, either. It represents likely a rushed AAA game seeking to check off all the boxes on how a game should be, which resulted in the shadowing of its promising elements, causing me to ultimately not recommend it to anyone. The game’s lack of focus takes away from the enjoyment and makes one regret their investment, unfortunately, hours beyond when one could get a refund on the game. 2/5, not recommended.",1644901211,1644901211,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Bad character model design and facial design (everyone looks like a toddler with heads too big, and asari have round bloated faces and all look identical)
- Poor facial animation and cutscene animation (have you seen that krogan ""fistfight"", video is going around youtube)
- Bad writing (both characters and story, just poorly written to the point where bad cringy dialogue ruins great quest design)
- Story is incomplete (a lot of thing are unexplained due to a mix of poor writing and future plans that fell through)
- Less character choices (most of it is just flavours of response, with some yes or no choices for accepting quests or quest resolutions; no reputation system of charisma checks so most of it doesn't matter)

[u]Pros[/u]
- Great gameplay:
- Exploration is fun (several varied environments with lots of things to do and fight)
- Open ended character skill system (doesn't lock you in to one class which allows for very varied characters)
- Great combat (its just fun, I finished legendary edition of the trilogy just now and i can say with honesty that andromeda combat is better; just make sure to mod out the different x and y sensitivity bs)
- Took me over 60 hours to complete almost fully (ignoring some minor tasks) and I had fun the entire time

[u]Final Recommendation:[/u]
- Buy on sale
- Mod
- Enjoy the gameplay
- Don't think too much about the story (not that hard tbf)

I was gonna mention the characters and dialogue as well, but just the entire writing is pretty abysmal when you just come back from having played through the trilogy.

There's a neat little scene in the beginning where you crash onto the first planet that leads you to believe it's gonna be great, but it's not. It's a sludge, through and through and there's very little to hold your attention unless you really enjoy exploring.

+ The graphics are pretty impressive, even though it's a 5 year old game... but it's overloading the system, poorly optimized. RDR 2 doesn't spin up the fans like this.
+ The 5.1 sounds and musics are really fine, it was terrible in the predecessors, even in Legendary.
+ It always has the potential to pop up briefly, and then it's quickly spoiled by some clichéd gimmick or totally weightless story.
+ After very very many hours, 1-2 characters are likeable.
+ Finally, a development team, that has taken nudity where it fits. Thank you. Seriously!
+ Some missions later in the game, are quite interesting.
+ You can see that they put a lot of work into the game, but guys... it was waaay too much for you!

0 - The gunplay is sometimes pretty good.

- The biggest problem with the game is the constant feeling of weightlessness. The characters are awfully hard to identify with and accept. And Kett - as an opponent - feels more cheesy than awesome, plus the game often gives you a poor Gears of War clone feeling.
- Former ME games can be linked to the choices made and their consequences. There's not much weight to any of these either, with respect to the small number of exceptions.
- The start is very bad. The game throws a million things at you and you don't even know what it is, only to find yourself wandering around some desert planet. It takes a long time to get into the rhythm of it.
- A big flaw is that after completing missions, some NPCs stop responding to you, or if they do, they pretend nothing happened. The game is full of a series of half-finished strokes like this.
- I don't understand why I have to endlessly watch the 30 second down and up animation! All well and good, but for the 100. time? Inhuman.
- The overall effect is made so much worse by the still lame animation and facial animation, which was simply better in the 15 years old first part! You see the same face over and over again on different NPCs. And here and there, you can see NPCs stretching out even after so many patches! Also: Why are the characters so dwarfed? 
- There are no shortage of planets and solar systems with no purpose, just there.
- Crafting and trading is almost dead. Everything drops from everywhere... repeatedly. The inventory limit should be the first thing you develop, because after that, it's a pain for minutes to know what to sell. Money doesn't make much sense. I bought practically nothing except the items needed for the quest.
- The companions reach the maximum level (relatively quickly), then their points are lost.
- Companion A.I. works poorly in combat. They pose in front of my weapon a lot, and are almost never able to kill anyone. They would disarm xy opponent, but that would still shoot me a thousand times and so many times I'had to take the final blow. It was terribly tiring.
- There's nothing to do with the worm on Eladeen. Why is it there then, when you can fight with Architects too???
- There are many instances of NPCs cutting each other off, very distracting. It happened more than once that halfway through a sentence the conversation stopped because another event overrode it. No order? Why no FIFO????
- Many fetch quests. But most of the normal quests also criss-cross the galaxy with you, while you watch the overwhelming half-minute docking or planet-leaving animations.
- Roughly 4% of humanity is LGBTQI+. I fought a bloody battle to keep my male Pathfinder from dating Reyes Vidal. Couldn't this be presented in a reasonable and engaging way, taking into account the needs of the MAJORITY and not constantly shoved in my face????
- Respawn. I took out a Kett base, mission accomplished, power down, miniboss killed. I'm coming out of there because I figured I wouldn't use fast travel, I'll pick it up if I missed something. Next thing I know, the same mobs are at the door as the ones I broke through on the way in! In fact, I have seen more than 1x where the engine has put the opponent behind cover from NOWHERE! I hate that! If I fight for something it's mine, it's over!
- I've had times where I've been really tired and gotten my eyes stuck during a play, but never one that is repeated every day in broad daylight! No joke. I read the mile-long clusterduck of NOTHING texts and just fall asleep. A couple of times 10-15 minutes have gone by. I swear! Why does this game have such an industrial amount of BAD, CONTENTLESS chatter???
- The conversations of the characters and the descriptions are amazingly meaningless. I like to spout off when I talk about something, but this is no way to make a game! Especially when everything in the game is completely unknown and the 19. I don't know who did what and when and where and the game totally behaves from minute 0 as if you were pushing New Game+ and blowing the War and Peace length corny lore by heart.
- Unfocused on a thousand fronts. You are in a completely different galaxy and there are only a few species of beings and most of them are humanoid???? But on the Milky Way, the original team invented creatures that you could only stare at! Yahg, Hanar, Volus, Leviathan, Ardat Yakshi, the Reapers and their transformed minions, etc.... there were like 50 kinds of mobs, NPCs, races, whatever... and here? Pathetic.
- Sodoku fired off as a ""break xy ALIEN console"" challenge and nothing else? This better be serious, because it would be rude as a joke! -.-
- If I want to talk on the Tempest with someone, I'll have to leave the WHOLE planet! You can't talk to the crow while your ship docked! Who did this??? Are you insane???
- There's a gun in the shop or on the research console... can you see how much it hurts, what it can do? NO!!!! You'll see it, when you make it! In text, it describes in half a page that this weapon will suck a Krogan alive, but what is the rate of fire, or what is the clip size? Manufacture it peasant, you'll find out.
- Menu system: The most complicated, opaque horror I've ever seen!
- Around 10% of the game, all your team members are with you. After that, for about 100 hours, they're all there. No change.
- Everything is littered with all the rubbish! Often I don't even know where to look, because there's info popping up everywhere, my teammates are talking, while A.I. is talking in my head, while the GUI is loaded with extras with 12 pop up messages, right, left, up down. And so are the interiors! It's totally easy to miss the important stuff, because everything looks the same, no miserable container or pick-ups are separated from the world. That's no way to make a game! Or you can, but it will be just that: bad!
- The simplest thing in the world is this: There's a quest, you want to follow it and it puts a sign on the map and you go there, right? Well, not here. Somehow I always find myself having to check the map over and over again, to see if I'm going the right way. Because even if I put down just one sign, it's still showing the OTHER quest related destinations associated with it... and in what colour? Same colour as orange.
- I've Dolby Vision capable TV. Turn on Dolby Vision. Black Screen. Pathetic.

I could write until morning about how ME: Andromeda is a spoiled option and how I can't recommend it to fans of ME games. I can hardly recommend it to anyone else. I finished it and put about 90 hours into the game because they called it ""Mass Effect"" and because I could see the will and the amount of work that went into it at times. This game is a textbook example of how LESS IS MORE! As well as how to spoil a lot of otherwise good ideas.

A game that had a pretty rough launch.......

It did not go well.....

But despite Bioware's flaws the game turned out pretty good.....

Journalists are spitting on this game calling it out right ""divisive"" and ""underwhelming"" needs to jump of a bridge into the ocean filled with hungry sharks.....

The problem with people is they keep comparing it to the Original Trilogy despite the fact that this game just started to tell a story we would have gotten if they continued it. The original trilogy is done and despite the fact that ME1 was also not so popular after ME2 launched, the same could have been said about MEA if we got the sequel. It might have launched badly but the people actually over did it by a FUCKING HUGE MILE. Its not to say I would give it perfect scores but FFS stop comparing it to the original trilogy (I know this was like fucking years ago but I still see people shitting on this game because they compare it to the O.T.).

MEA has had enough backlash that scared off the devs from making a sequel. We would have had one by now but I guess remastering a  game franchise that didn't fucking need it at all need I remind you. And yes I was also part of those idiots who bought the Legendary Edition. Don't know why but yeah its out there with the same bugs and glitches need I remind you again.

Love this game....
Decent Story
Great Combat
Better mechanics 
Better version of the Maco
Good open world aspects 
Meh Loyalty missions
Good Characters

While I think the two galaxies and their respective stories should not be compared, I feel this game is GREAT for what you buy.

If you like Mass Effect (And any BioWare game for that matter), you're bound to be thrown in a compelling story full of intrige and character development. Choices feel like they matter and made me feel like I truly called the shots. And the villain just makes you be in awe and terrified. They really added some terrifying aspects to the story that left me yearning for more. 

The worlds you visit might vary greatly, but are always hyper-realistic. The graphics and amount for detail really helps with making the worlds feel alive and each have their own story that you're just immersed in. The soundtrack is of course amazing and really helps with said immersion.

Though in every Mass Effect game there's always characters being subjectively less fun, the squad mates that you come across in the story really have depth and great interactions when on missions together. OH and the POWERS. My build was biotic so I can't say much about the other builds but DAMN! Charging around at enemies and throwing lances through their heads or sucker-punching the ground for huge AOE Damage really is FUN.

If you want a game that gives you hours of immersion, a funny and mysterious storyline, this sci-fi adventure is GREAT. Don't let the bad reviews in the early stages of production affect your choice. Play it and judge for yourself. I fell in love and was left crying with joy numerous times!

Combat is fun, more complex and you can customize better your loadout. You get a more advanced crafting system and better skill tree to develop your character. A shame that you cannot change your companio weapons.

*The game's biggest sin is it doesn't respect your time. Many main missions can't be accessed without reading emails because that's a thing a thousand years in the future and can't be accessed except at 2 consoles. So you're on a planet and want to progress you have to backtrack, watch a short clip of the ship taking off, read your email then go back to the space map to go back to the planet your were just on. 
*Characters are uninteresting and their loyalty missions are the closest you get to character development but with all the BS it takes it doesn't feel worth it in the end. Enemies are uninteresting and cliched in their motives. 
*Gameplay is underwhelming. enemies are have little variety and is mostly just reskins, depending on the mission or location. You don't even fight the final baddie its just a capture the hill esque horde mode with a 10 second cut-scene for your efforts. 
ME3 may have ended a great story with a lackluster ending but at least it kept you entertained and wanting to see the impact your choices made. This game does none of that and uses an interesting concept to waste your time.

let me explain, 

I bought for the first time when it first came out for the ps4 and i played it to the end, thoroughly enjoyed it. I completed every side quest, did every task, and I scanned every planet. probably logged more than 300 hours on it and tbh i didnt understand why everyone hated this game.

then mass effect legendary came out for the pc. I had never played the original trilogy and now that it came out remastered, i thought ill give it go. boy was the original series good, i was outright missing work just to play the game fully and find out what happened next. the game-play wasnt bad but the story behind it and the way your choices completely affect they way your game is played and the ending made it incredibly entertaining and immersive. the dialogue options felt like they carried weight and the choices commander sheperd made affected everyone and him. plus the fact that you could choose to win as a rogue or a paragon or both made it even more dynamic.  hell even if you ignore the way you can change the main story line, the universe that commander sheperd was in felt unique, mysterious, and drew on my curiosity. if nothing else it felt like someone had put thought into every detail even the small ones. every plot point had a purpose to the story and every plot device had a history behind it.  it was clear the milky way galaxy had millions if not billions of years of history and we, the player, were only seeing one important part.

and then after completing the trilogy i decided i want to play andromeda again and see how i felt about, plus it was on sell for the pc. off the bat i felt like i was forced to play as commander sheperd's cringy younger sibling. sheperd-lite basically, worse off i had to watch as the person in this story with probably the most similarities as commander sheperd die on the first mission. also the kett felt very much a knock off  of the collectors/ geth, and the remnant as the protheans.  then when the andromeda's story went into more details it felt like it was just ripping off the reaper/prothean conflict. even the side mission stories felt like rip offs of the original trilogy, for example they took omega and made it into kadara with pretty much the same characters, actually now that think about they both had a mission involving plague but atleast the trilogy had a more interesting one with even more interesting doctor.

anyway i have more critics but ive ranted enough. there are somethings i like, the angara felt unique and fleshed out, the graphics were amazing and the gameplay was well put together. if your fan the original trilogy youre probably not ganna like it, it just replicates the original story but kinda just throws it at you and hopes the nostalgia will make you like it",1644297396,1644297396,True,38,0,0.756716310977935791,0,True,False,False

(spoiler) it interesting alot of people come at this game expecting something to the original 3, but you have to remember that although it is in the shared universe of ME this is an entirely different story, instead of fighting the reapers the hidden plot of this game was to escape galatic extinction of the reapers trying to make a new home in another galaxy. but no one is aware of that which honestly seems odd imo. so as long as you look at this game in a scope of it being a fresh start in a different part of hte universe you should enjoy it.

All the elements are there, but it's all sub-par.  Sure, there's the sleek new graphics.  The combat and character progression is good.  But, the writing...  Oh, the writing.  

The writing is sophomoric, at best.  Who the hell says, ""My face is tired"" or ""I really pissed that one off! It must be because I shot him in the FACE!""???  At worst, it's downright trite and cliche'd in every way.  It's like the writers stole every trope they could find from Star Trek, Babylon 5, Firefly, and [insert humanities course here], and wrapped it up in a Mass Effect veneer.  There's actually a ""Captain, we're being hailed"" scene complete with the giant view screen and whitless banter between the humans and aliens.  

If you can think of a movie where a character has done a thing, then it happens in this game.  Remember the scene in Starship Troopers where the guy keeps shooting the alien bug after it's dead and people are like ""hey chill out, it's dead"".  Yeah, it happens in this game.  Never mind the disjointed writing, either.  It's like the need to shoehorn these tropes into the story outweighed the need for logic or coherence in the storyline.  Oh, and apparently transgender people just flatout tell everyone and their mother that they're transgender on the first time meeting them, because the need to promote ""tolerance"" also outweighs the need for characters to behave realistically.  So, that's a thing in this game, too.

The villians, the Ket, are a crappy watered down version of the Reapers and Borg.  As far as villains go, they are bland and completely unrelatable.  The new alien allies are all idiots.  ""Can you go ahead and transform us into Ket because we're sad? Thanks!"".  The robotic artifacts are basically just forerunner constructs, which is original(?).

There's romance options, though!  You can even see boobs if you play your cards right, but why would you want to?  The character models are universally unattractive.  But, hey, ""boobs"", am I right?

Get it on a deep sale if you're going to buy it.  Otherwise, stick with the Mass Effect Legendary Edition if you want the authentic Mass Effect experience.  The one with the good writing and characters.

Legendary Version is worth being bought on discount. 
If you try to do all side-quests and play on hard, you can fill up to 100 hours with halfway game-fun. 

The part about the 9 required out of possible 11 data cores should be checked out by you before playing, there are some explainations from the community, that would have proven worthy to me, if only i had. ;) 
I used these helps after i finished all quests but this one and found the 8th of 9 required cores, but the last missing one - along the 3 potential ones left - got lost, since they are categorized as ""missable"". 
So i nearly got 100% of this game done, but due to these ""missables"" i lack one of the most interesting parts - solving Phoebe's puzzle. 

If you're not in for struggling fights and feeling inferior to grunts, you rather play the game on easy/normal mode, focus on the story, enjoy the breathtaking landscape, and don't build too many of the weapons and stuff, you can research and build...i basically researched and built only 1 type of armor and 3 types of weapons and it was enough, to do the game on hard-mode. 

The jetpack allows a way better steering, than the one i've known from ELEX before and with the right profile-class, you even feel like a space-ninja. 
Saying so, the game somewhat felt like ELEX, Warframe and Gothic gave birth to this game. 
Since i played some FPS before, this game was a nice kind of diversity but with common elements. 

Worst things about the game were the low multiplayer-activities on rookie-level, sometimes occuring bugs of the UI (especially when using the squad-console for parallel achievements and ressource-farming) and that you might have to return to your space-ship and the Nexus after each mission solved, for else you might miss an oportunity for the ""romance""-achievement coincidently...and i guess, even if you do so, you still got a chance, to fail it, so rather just let it be and enjoy the game itself, i guess. :D 

Oh yeah and of course the curse of EA: 
You require an EA-account, to register and play the game, as well as EA's Origin-launcher to be installed (will be started automatically, when you start the game), but if you can live with that legit sort of ""spyware"" (you know, the default TOS-stuff...""analyzing statistics for marketing purpose...blablabla...) on your computer, i guess, it's alright. 
I did not rye the purchase, neither the time spent on it, though it took me some hours to ""get into the groove"" for the game...the beginning was pretty exhausting (alright, i played it hard, maybe that's been the reason), but later on, it was like ""did i ever not enjoy playing it?"". 

Also...the game contains grind (therefore the cross-reference to Warframe, not only for the class, making you feel like a space-ninja), which seems struggling, but with the Legendary Edition you get the only armor you really need to wear, unless you reached level 50 and can build the only better one at a usefull level and with helpfull modifications.

Its not great with multiple horrid animations, emotions falling short in a big way, textures that look amazing alongside textures that look like garbage and an ""Open world"" full of fetch quests. Its a 5/10 game in a 9/10 series. Certain things like the Jump Jet, R&D, and whatnot i would have loved to seen in ME:1-3. But for everything the game has going for it, it has 2-3 issues that can often overshadow the gains.  It honestly feels like an MMO but you're the last holdout still playing on completely dead servers. Considering i got it during the winter sell and it was stupid cheap, i cant complain, it was certainly worth every penny of the roughly 5$ i paid for it. I had heard of SJW stuff and people complaining about political narratives but i really didnt notice any of that. To me all the short comings came from the game itself, not outside narratives or agendas. But again, had this been a stand alone title without having to live up to a standard, it would be a better game because you couldnt compare it to its predecessors. That being said, if you wanna play a ME game, buy the re-release of the trilogy. You'd think this long after its release a few simple patches would be all it would take to fix most of the issues the game has. But as it is, its like the game didnt live up to the hype they intended so they abandoned it. Seriously though as minor as it sounds animations can make or break a game. Walking through an area seeing the animation of someone working on a ship thinking ""Oh cool"" then taking a few steps and seeing the exact same animation but the person is just standing next to some pottery or a statue. God forbid you can talk to them. You better stand face to face, dont activate them too quick or youll be talking to someones shoulder because they dont interact with you at all. They just deliver the lines as if you're having a normal conversation. Seeing people clipping into their gear or having the same conversation regardless of choice in dialog is common. In a triple A title thats embarrassing. If this was ME and it was some indie crew id sing its praises but EA is fat rich and you still get a subpar game. 

So, TLDR: If you can get it under 10$ its not bad. Anymore than that you're better off supporting a studio that actually cares about what they put out there.

The lore is lackluster, your squadmates aren't flushed out or interesting. Even the bad guys are just copies of the Reapers, and done to the point that they're not even scary or threatening. It just lacks any real gravity that a Bioware game should have. It is a chore to put hours into this game. The worlds are cool, but they're barren for the most part and you essentially do the same run-a-round quests for each place. Just go back and play the Trilogy for the 5th time instead!

Still, it ruined immersion for me. For example, tearjerker moment is happening, sad soundtrack is playing, but you look someone in the face and see  footage from the  Mask (movie with Jim Carrey). 
Plot (at least part, which I saw before decided to drop the game) didn't catch me. It's just driving around a planet, [strike]capturing towers[/strike] establishing outposts and gathering resources [spoiler](prior to that, you listen to the complaints about your competence level for several hours. Doubts are raised by the same people, who sat at the space station for several years without achieving anything[/spoiler].

Overall, due to my fast dissapointment in the game I couldn't say that it's bad, but it's definitely not good either. If you a space-lover or want to try it yourself - wait for the sale.

That being said, that is the way every Mass Effect game has been! And honestly, the graphics, sound, game mechanics, fighting system were all as good or better than any other game in the series.

Yeah. The original trilogy really sets the bar high, and it is unrealistic for Andromeda to be expected to reach that high in just one game what the OT builds in three games. But if you lower your expectation and treat Andromeda as its own game, this is a game worth playing, if only for one playthrough.

Good and bad:

+++ Mobility. You have much more movement freedom than ME 1-3 and it's fantastic. Still missing that crouch button though.
+++ Return of the Mako -ahem Nomad- and open world exploration gameplay
+++ Attention to detail, changing dialogue depending on small actions you took, characters you meet actually travel in their own vehicles, etc. Scanning is also nice, it gives additional information about objects in the world which is very nice for worldbuilding and learning about future tech in this universe. It's also quick, which makes me actually want to use it.

+ / - Combat is okay but nothing special. Cover is awkward and wonky, weapons so far sound unimpressive and the assault rifle zoom is weirdly zoomed in a bit too much. Crosshair options would've been nice.
+ / - UI is okay, though sifting through different quests is more tedious than it should be with all the sub menu's, and the endless 'updated' markers must be hell for any OCD gamers. Thank god for that 'mark all as viewed' option.

--- The characters are bland and uninteresting. Now the og ME had the most incredible characters so it's okay to not live up to those standards, but the party cast I've seen so far is just... boring. I don't care about these people at all and that pains me to say. Everyone so far is forgettable. They look, sound and act boring.
--- The script and dialogue writing at times is atrocious. Emotional scenes are destroyed by the completely unrealistic responses Ryder has.
--- Facial animations are incredibly ugly and awkward, body animations same thing. Running is laughable and everyone's facial expression is just.. empty and dead. Characters are also very dated looking in general.
--- BUGS. I waited for yeaaaars before purchasing this, expecting the game to be polished after the backlash at release. But I already encountered NPC's clipping halfway through the floor, dialogue cutting off mid sentence and sometimes cutscene dialogue being entirely muted / missing.
--- Sidequests have been mediocre so far and that's being generous

I don't believe it's worth a full price game, but if you find it on sale like I did for around 10 dollars, then pick it up. The story and themes are very compelling and interesting. You're essentially space pioneers sent to colonize a new galaxy, and the game does an excellent job making you feel like a true leader on this expedition into the great unknown. The graphics and gameplay are top tier. Combat is smooth and very fun; and space exploration has never looked better. However....

The reason I say to pick the game up on a good sale is it is riddled with faults. The concept of simply entering your ship while it's docked on a planet is completely foreign, and instead, you're forced into cutscenes of watching your ship leave every time you need to board even if it's to simply check your space email. Starting the game is also a pain. I have a pretty powerful PC, but every time I started the game, I had to wait a minute or so before I could move around without choppy sequences. And if you think that's bad, forget trying to play the game without Origin connected. I had a night where my internet was down, I booted up the game, and was only able to play for three minutes before finally giving up on the idea that it was going to function without internet connectivity (which is a feature I hate of solo games nowadays). Some of the dialogue doesn't make sense - characters will say bizarre things that aren't relevant to the situation. And finally, no matter what was going on, the facial animations of the characters were always....awful. My protagonist always seemed indifferent to what was happening around her, even when shit was really hitting the fan. 

By all means, I still had a good time playing the game. I saw it through to the end, and I think it overall told an interesting story, but you can definitely tell the game was rushed out and needs some polish.

It's about 90 hours of talking to different aliens and traveling around different planets on fetch quests and killing hundreds or thousands of enemies. If you liked Mass Effect 1 through 3, this is more of the same.

The biggest disappointment for me is the story. The whole setup of the game involves your father doing things to his family against their consent, and somehow we're just supposed to accept that and not be pissed off about it. Ryder completely ignores the abuse that was done to her and we don't even get a single comment of ""i never asked for this"" a la Adam Jensen. At one point you even find some people who agree that what was done to you was horrific, but your mission results in them changing their minds!? It's totally wack. And then couple that with the kind of creepy colonial attitude running through everything...

Turns out it's much more difficult to care about a crew of colonizers than it was to care about species who are literally fighting for their civilizations, their history, their continued existence - as we did in Mass Effect 1 through 3. Emotionally, then, this game falls flat. I didn't care about any of the characters or their stories. You kill thousands of people while pretending to be some kind of peaceful explorer. It doesn't feel honest. The main quest is short and doesn't really reveal any epic secrets or interesting ideas. The entire game feels like a side mission.

But. You do get to scan worlds. You get to drive around in a nifty little car. You get to solve some puzzles. You get to hang out with your team and gain their trust.

Yeah the game is a buggy mess with broken and janky animations but for the most part i find those funny, and i haven't run into any game breaking bugs. No crashes, only 1 soft lock which was fixed with a reload, no saves getting corrupted, nothing serious.

Probably because while mature gamers who enjoy rpgs could get something out of it, without knowing Mass Effect's lore that well, or getting frustrated with various systems or game elements, I think most people would give up half way through.

[u]The long review:[/u]
Unfortunately, even years on since its infamously buggy release, the sum of Mass Effect Andromeda is disappointing when what is promised and explored screams unmet potential. 

This is hugely disappointing because its clear from where the story finishes that another installment is expected, but this will almost certainly never materialise because of how it was received (not well by hardcore Mass Effect fans). In a weirdly tragic way, it would almost have been better if Bioware never released Andromeda, or at the very least gave it another year to mature, because there are parts of the game that are enjoyable and it's disappointing knowing that a return to Andromeda will likely never happen.

While most people will point out that many of the characters are not written that well or are forgettable, you will almost certainly find some likeable and interesting. The same goes with certain questlines too. Visually the game is impressive, especially considering the shift to a different game engine (that wasn't used in the other MA games), and runs well on recent hardware. New systems for combat and crafting, while I didn't engage with them initially, actually give players more choices to formulate how they want to play in combat and explore in the wider game - so will be good for revising the game at some stage.

The music, when you actually hear any, is nice as well. But because I guess Bioware was going with the whole exploration theme in this game too, a lot of the time music seems non-existent or is substituted for environmental sounds. Which is fine, but a little bit disappointing having come from the other games whose soundtracks were solid.

More annoyingly however, because the game is more open world than even the original Mass Effect (one) was, the pacing of the main story and side missions is all over the place. While some things are left purposefully vague for plot related reasons or to learn about later (or speculate to yourself), I think because of the game's overall weakness in certain areas that this made me a lot less charitable to thinking that they couldn't have done the story much better than what was presented.

As others have pointed out, character animations outside of cutscenes is lacking a lot more than you'd expect for a game 10 years on the series - but this can almost entirely be blamed for switching game engines (which was almost certainly an EA thing at the time). I did find it annoying you often have to face a character directly to talk to them (unless going into a cutscene), but in my mind this is excusable for having to create the game on a brand new engine.

That's probably why there's a multiplayer mode too (EA loves multiplayer elements), which I would've entirely sacrificed to get a better singleplayer game, but it is what it is and it seems to play fine. Realistically though, you're not going to buy this for multiplayer, so I'm just going to view it in this review as an unnecessary system incorporated into a singleplayer game in order to encourage friends to get it.

My biggest gripe with Andromeda by far though is how the travel system is handled because while it's important to fill the areas with different things to do, the amount of time wasted travelling between systems, planets, landing and taking off, is considerable if you're trying to complete as many objectives/tasks as possible. Which, ironically for a game about trying to get a stable start in a new place, means you should not go above and beyond trying to finish every little thing you get if you respect your time. Once you hit a certain level of side quests that 'complete' a planet, then you should just ignore quests that aren't specially marked for specific categories because they are quite boring and time consuming for little payout.

Quite literally, fetch quests in a game about sci-fi exploration is about the most non-sci-fi thing and antithetical aspect of this game's draw. After a while, not uncommon for these kinds of games, it seems like if we weren't making progress for the team, then none of the thousands of colonists would despite the fact that a team of about 10 can only realistically do so much. Sure there are plot reasons for everything, but combined with the travel thing which really bothered me, it felt like everyone else in the galaxy was useless and made me dislike the game for the rest of a play session.

So while I get that exploration and visuals are very important to a game all about exploring a new galaxy, 2 minutes to just arrive on another planet that may need to fade to black after the same landing cinematic is just beyond frustrating after a while. Especially because many quests have you go back and forth between different locations and its near impossible to stack them all up or know when they should ideally be done with the main storyline as well. That's without all the side frustrations of learning how to play and interact with game elements, taking the story and characters in, while giving the same the benefit of the doubt that it will be a rewarding experience.

Honestly, had it felt like I hadn't wasted probably two (or more) hours in my playthrough travelling between planets in unskippable cutscenes, I would've given Andromeda a generous thumbs up despite not loving every minute of it and having some harsh things to say about it. But it is unbelievably thoughtless how travel cutscenes and times was overlooked in play testing, and that no one picked up how egregiously frustrating this would be for momentum and for the likeability of your pilot and navigator, not to mention the whole experience of the game. Sure loading screens in the older Mass Effect games weren't always as detailed, but at least they seemed to get you where you wanted to go with less time wasted. So why couldn't Andromeda work that in somehow?

[u]Bottom Line:[/u] To reiterate, I had fun and frustrations with this game. But truthfully I couldn't recommend anyone pay full price or buy this on anything less than a huge discount (which I did at a generous sale), because while there's a lot to like and explore, you may just come away thinking you wasted your time and money on something that should have lived up to the potential of the original trilogy of games. 

[b]My recommendation[/b], play the original trilogy, an excellent bundle of games. And if you liked them, particularly the open-world elements of Mass Effect One, along with the combat of Three, then give this game a try if for no other reason than to see more of the series because it still has great potential.

I played as a female Ryder and I think that's the best option which I recommend to everyone. It makes up for the slightly odd humor and makes it more bearable while playing. I spent 65 hours on the game and reached 60lvl before Meridian without completing only about 10 side quests.

It should be noted that Andromeda is not a bad game. But it is incomparable to the original trilogy. To show this I will list the pros and cons.

Pros:
- The opening sequence of the game is very good. The cinematic interludes, first contact, a completely different view of Habitat 7 and the plot twist is solid. I also liked the occasional interlude showing the antagonist's reaction. 
- The existence of SAM's artificial super intelligence and generally using him as a narrator, assistant and generally what pushes the plot forward is probably what I liked most about the game. 
- The arrival on the Nexus is also pretty good
- The combat system is just good the tech powers, biotics, weapon modifications and profiles allow you to choose the way you want to fight
- Nomad riding is fun especially with upgrades
- The truth behind the Initiative and the creation of SAM and its true mission
- SAM's jokes 
- The story of the Salarian ark is something I was hoping for in terms of atmosphere
- Nice planets and even varied if you turn a blind eye 
- Some characters are enjoyable like Jaal, Drack, Kallo
- Resource gathering was even decent
- The final sequence of the game is quite spectacular in its own way
- Textures are visually pleasing 

Cons:
- The UI design, its proportions, unituitiveness and the million markers
- No minimap or holo when exploring. The regular map is broken on PC and I've seen it work better on consoles, but clicking on something sometimes requires zooming in or setting a marker instead of selecting it, which is annoying in a game where you have hundreds of objectives to do. 
- XP balance and the fact that to unlock the highest research rank you must be 80 lvl which is unattainable by the game without unnecessary grind or other methods. 
- Most human character models look like potatoes. This really is the future and I haven't seen a woman with normal long hair in the entire game. Even the Asari look somehow worse. 
- The animations are very often good only to look handicapped moments later.
- There are many understatements and sometimes even plot holes. Like the fact that the exiles should be about a thousand and I think I killed more of them on just one planet
- Quests are often the same only with a different thing to find
- Scanning is a joke at the beginning I thought you can scan plants because that's what we came here for, while throughout the game you can scan maybe 15 plants all you do is scan some alien tech 
- Very strange humor in places even in quite serious situations.
- Reskins of the same 5 animals on every planet 
- You seem to be at war with the Kett but you don't destroy their equipment just kill them and leave everything as it was?
- At the end it didn't even occur to me what happened to the main antagonist until the next scene played.

I think the game had ambitious plans to make everything more and better but by setting such a task many things were left unfinished. Maybe cancelled dlc would fix that and the game would be better. I think the goal was set a little too high for the first part. After all, saving the galaxy in a few weeks is a bit much. Still, I don't think I wasted my time. I would treat this game as a big-budget sci-fi summer movie with the Mass Effect universe as a background. 

There are still some bugs but they are not serious, only 2 times I had to load the game since UI glitched, the rest is like npc passing through a wall, some of their strange movements or physics.",1642521144,1642521144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You are given several open worlds that unlock as the story progresses. Lots of side quests and lore. At the time of this review I'm 93 hours into my first play through and I still have a fey side quests left. But you can choose to ignore them if you like and focus on the main quest line. You can scan objects to gain intel on them or to get help while doing quests.

The combat mechanism lets you try out different tactics and skill sets. The down side is that you get only three quick slots, but you can switch different profiles even during combat. Don't worry about making wrong choices while spending skill points, because the game lets you reset skills (for a price that increases with each time). You get a little jet pack that lets you jump higher and further that’s fun.

The NPC's could look better. And some animations could use a tune-up, but this can be ignored since it's not game breaking. Dialog mechanism is excellent. Instead of Renegate vs Paragon, you get Emotion, Logic, Casual and Professional dialog options. Relationships are interesting but still feel like there could’ve been more to them. You get to romance outside of your squad as well.

The story feels like the developers were hoping to expand it in further games. The same feeling is given of by the many decisions the game gives that are supposed to have consequences but mostly aren’t yet seen.

All in all it is a good game and I really enjoyed playing it, but it does have its down sides. The side quests tend to get repetitive and boring. The main villains have a weird unsatisfying feel to them. Some squad mates could use better character growth, but those are just a few parts of the whole game.

Side note to Mass Effect fans: We tend to compare MEA to ME trilogy, but we forget that ME1 also has its flaws and what made the trilogy so epic was the whole story through all three games.

 My issues are as follows:

1.) they brought back the whole open world travel like ME 1 had. Cool except just as in ME1 the objectives were far away, and you just waste countless hours driving around. Sure there are fast travel points but overall the open world in this game feels like a complete chore to do. Same as in ME1. They sprinkle a few random encounters but its nothing all that unique, just random enemies to fight for no reason.

2.) In ME2/ME3 the dialogue actually felt like you were having a conversation. In this game it really feels and sounds like most lines are just the actor and actress just being bored as fuck and reading from a script. IDC about the whole eyes and heads moving random directions or anything like that, if anything they were hilarious. But overall the conversations went from feeling like people were actually talking to each other(2/3) to just having someone read a script to you.

3.) Most of your squadmates are pretty flat 99% of the time. Occasionally you get some good dialogue and interactions with them, but overall they fall way short of even your squad in ME1. The loyalty missions are pretty good and you can get some decent backstory but overall the character development was worse off than ME1

4.) The combat system is definitely more polished than in the trilogy(no more getting cover fucked randomly and you can actually sprint!(WOOOOHOOOO!!!!!). But you will find 9/10 times there hit boxes on most mobs are SUPER fucked. Skill system is also pretty poor honestly. Where before each class had its perks and you can really specialize, in MEA I find each profile to be pretty lacking(only allows you 3 skills, and you cannot control your squad power usage which FUCKING SUCKS)

5.) story was alright, but honestly until you get to the last third of it, you feel like your just bored grinding through shit quests in another game. 
6.) Quests: I hope you like fetch missions where you drive around and do shit every once in a while because literally every fucking mission is a fetch quest.

I have over 100 hours and have completed two of the 5 planets 100% and took the time to understand the characters, their backgrounds and world references.. it is so deep and full it's dumb, I really honestly on my own grave do not understand the negativity. 

You can create any weapon you want with Automatic, Burst, Single Fire, Energy Beam, Electric Beam, Sticky Bombs, Homing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds etc, literally any weapon can be modded to your play style and liking....you can even bring back the thermal clip from Mass Effect 1. Dozens of suit combinations as well as per part colouring..... at any time you can redo your skills.... or character.... the effects in this game are the best, I can't stress that enough.

I play with HDR10 and a sound amp DAC for my headphones and I can not get enough of it, same mind blowing feelings I got when I first played Mass Effect 1, still own the OG game guide from EB games as well. 

There are aspects of the Mass Effect Trilogy that get to out of hand and super hero comic book like, the first Mass Effect retained an immersive new sci-fi experience and Andromeda does the same, Mass Effect 2 and 3 are all about dramatics and story - like current Netflix series. 

Though your character may not have dramatic flash backs and drastic over the top choices, you still have a deep rewarding experience being the Pathfinder and exploring and making choices - especially compared to currently released RPG titles. You are not the end all see all or meant to be anything else but a Pathfinder and you come across many like yourself - failing and succeeding and moving forward. The choices you have to make are for humanity, not a conjoined military effort, there is the sense if humans fail, the fight will go on

2019-2020 First 70hrs -this game has the best combat hands down in any third person shooter on the market to date. the visual effects in this game are also front of the line. what this game suffers from is a sloppy launch. that's it. it truly is a 9/10 game. facial animations are not even that bad, you can tell it is just the way the graphics engine is meant to work. considering across the board it maintains one steady graphical presentation it is a very impressive game.",1594212952,1642063304,True,4,0,0.519952297210693359,0,True,False,False

Also there are areas where you can't manually save, meaning you've got a ticking time bomb of lost progress and possibly a bricked save on your hands. To top this off manually saving in your rover can corrupt the save. These bugs have fucked me over in two separate attempts to play through this game and have no fix 5 years after release. I repeat THERE IS NO FIX FOR THESE GAME BREAKING BUGS YOU ARE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER.

Origin integration is ass as expected, getting an achievement sometimes minimises the window and takes you out of full screen. Which is easy to fix, but annoying none the less, since it happens regularly. Every time you boot the game it gives you the same pop up about the chat function on Origin and I can't figure out how to turn it off. Sometimes Origin doesn't automatically log in or logs you out if your connection is disrupted. While the game can be played offline, THE GAME WILL NOT LET YOU PLAY WITHOUT ORIGIN SIGN IN. 

The combat's pretty good and I got some fun out of it, but everything else sucks dick harder than Gil, this game's token homosexual side character. Ultimately it's more trouble than it's worth and I have no idea why I played it so long. Curiosity maybe? It makes Cyberpunk look like a polished Sony or Nintendo title with how fucking broken and unfinished it is. Atleast that game wouldn't randomly brick your save or force you to install GOG and run it in the background.

Keep an extra back up of your own save file and do not trust that the cloud back up will function on this at all. 

Will play the full extent of the game. But after all these years and the developers left the game in a pretty bad state just to start with is very disappointing. 

Pro's: 
-Game is over all mostly fun, some okay plots here and there and some funny jokes(including dad jokes) along the way. 
-Graphics have been improved, and the options in the graphics are pretty well done especially compared to the last game. 
-Combat, though there are a few issues, over all was very refreshing and pretty intuitive and fun to play. 
-You have the ability to mix and match classes and abilities in a very wide range which is very refreshing
-Crafting armor and weapons is a nice touch, though adding some different options for mods or armor changes would be nice.
-Open world really is a great freeing part of this, and something that was needed badly. The ability to jump on a ton of things the change the playing field, along with a lot of enemies being able to do the same, use random things as cover, exploring a huge map was a great improvement.

Con's
-Story is at best mediocre. Even though a few characters are decent and have okay to almost good side quests, mostly its the same thing over and over again.
-Side quests can be aggravating as hell, especially when they could be almost good, except that you basically have no morality(paragon renegade) options. Most decisions you make have almost no impact on the game. Consistently the options in these quests are also made with virtually(pun not intended?) no information or without any reason to be what they are. Not to mention with the same quest line/different planet, shows a serious lack of story writing by the developers.
-Several side quests are were broken and never fixed by the developers which is a shame. 
-Characters have a very serious issue of being badly written with a few exceptions. Not only does it not make sense for your character to be filling the shoes you are filling, with the bad plot decision(above), a lot of times you are stuck with a stupid or dumb choice when dealing with their characters and lot of it deals with hypocritical and super bad leadership. You would have thought that with this particular mission the whole game is based around, it would have been put together a little better. 
-The menu system is very convoluted and confusing and takes a while to get used to and still can be very obnoxious. 
-While the graphics were a good improvement, the game is full of bugs. Game goes windowed when going to desktop, game crashes a fair amount, enemies get glitched in walls all the time, cursor issues, quest lines get broken(something goes wrong with the game, not just left broken by the devs). Cant save game while looking at a door that opens, certain weapons dont function correctly when modded, and the list goes on. 
-Character models are atrocious. To start with the character creator, very clunky, and very bad. difficult to use, and options are bad. 
-NPC models are copy pasted through out the entire game with a very few number of exceptions. I get have a few varieties of copy pasted generic NPCs doing whatever in the back ground, but even a lot of the main NPCs fall into this. The Asari sticks out the most is that all, minus 1 character I can think of, have the same model with a different color/outfit. Thats just laziness from the developer. 
-NPC modeling also has another issue. When communicating have the time the NPC's are making awkward facial expressions and really feel off, especially when the eyes kind just wander kind aimlessly and face muscles dont match the expression they are giving. 

TLDR: Overall, while the game looks pretty great, character controls are more natural and feel good, there are a lot of issues with it. Game crashing, bad GUI, game forcing windowed mode, bad quest lines, broken quests, horrible decision options, and more sour the experience it really should be. There was a Golden opportunity here, and honestly the developer blew it.

Where to start, the combat system felt really dynamic, but the enemies are plain stupid on normal an total bullet sponges on insanity, which is unfortunate because they actually use tactics like flanking on insanity. It also devalues the great feeling of crafing a nice weapon like the black widow if you still have to hit multiple headshots on basic mobs.

The voice acting and animations leave much to be desired. Facial animations in cutscenes are sometimes in uncanny valley territory and othertimes cringe inducingly bad. The same goes for the voice acting. What I find really odd is that characters sometimes look like clay added to a stick person and other times show detailed complexion in their skin.

It also is quite buggy. The game froze completely on a couple of occasions and had to be shutdown via task manager. There are a few reports of this happening to other people in 2017 and since my pc should run this game more than comfortably I guess this is an unfixed bug.

The short of it?: No engaging characters, combat is more jumpy shooty, story is meh, graphics are nice, and no real wonder when exploring.

I played the originals like everyone else and avoided ME:A when the hype got suss. I heard all the issues on release and decided to skip it. After getting back into ME and seeing this on sale I figured why not. While there are other reviews that are more in depth and much better written here is my take.

The concept is intriguing: Flee the Milky Way before the reapers arrive and start anew. Plenty of space for new stories and hey, use the conflicts, story, and lore from the original triology and you have a good base to reboot the franchise. Well. My friends. Your ol pal Brois has bad news. The game, patches and all isn't what it should be.

We are shown characters that have no real depth or just not quite 'real' enough to engage with. Heck, many of the characters (races) don't have their traits and quirks. Either this can be hand waved with 'they were chosen because they are above that' or 'ignore to engage with the story'.

Speaking of story... uh... it's there. It is lacklustre. There will never be awards for the story. Why? Because there is no engaging characters and the choices we make have no weight. We encounter the big bad but the conclusion again, has no weight. Even after we see all we see and all we experience I only shoot at him to get an achievement rather than see how the story unfolds. So few characters die because of our decisions. When they do you forget they existed. Even in one mission we are revealed to some horrible truths of ultimate horror aaaaaaaaaand I didn't feel impacted. I had no connection or rage at their blight. 

The original games have weight on the decisions made as it impacts the story. BOTH negative and positive choices are explored. Wipe out a species? Sure. Here that would never be allowed to happen. The absence of a paragon/renegade style conversation system gives us too much freedom. What we get is pick the option you want and there won't be any real repercussions or requirements needed.

Which leads me to ask you, person who has spent too much time reading this already. Didn't Mass Effect pose questions like what is the point of life? Is AI life? How does the burden of war, extinction and a ruthless force from the nightmarish dark affect a hero? Is genocide an option you can accept? In Andromeda we don't get that. There are questions asked but they are whispered where questions regarding future entries in this new triology and DLC are shouted.

Audio is okay but the music doesn't grab you and enhance the scene. It doesn't make you feel like an explorer when flying around space, doesn't add much to combat, and what plays during cutscenes is nice but there is a distinct horn or trumpet that is appearing through modern games nowadays.

Combat is that modern run around with jetpacks and leap on top of things (YES. IMAGINE ME1-3 WHERE YOU CAN STAND ON TABLES AND SHOOT). Buuuuuuuuut why can I only have a hotbar of three powers before having to use favourites? Why can't I control what powers my squad uses or not uses instead of just levelling them up? Where is the damn power bar that pauses time and lets me plan?
Crafting your own guns is somewhat pointless. That full auto-grenade launcher? Not worth it. Rely on powers and running around.
Enemy types (other than humanoids) are about half a dozen each. No real different strategies are needed to take them down. I didn't even use ammo mods. Just find cover and shoot. Then wait for the next thing to scan or reinforcements to drop from a glitchy ship,

Speaking of. Enemies in dropships are unkillable until they start to jump from that ship (that can be of another race than their own -Derp-). And the speed of the vehicle shows them outside the hull, just standing in mid-air.

That is one of the leftover errors that survived patches and updates. Thankfully most of the facial animations have been cleaned up (except Cora smiling constantly in one scene when she should not have), clipping ain't that bad, and there being no reload bugs to worry about.

But the patches haven't fixed load times. Users on high end machines have had issues with 10 minute plus loading times when it comes to 'building shaders'. A 2017 fix is to turn off V-Sync. How and why it works I don't know but it does.

PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF THE GODDESS INSTALL QoL MODS THAT REMOVE CUTSCENE TRANSITIONS. We are meant to go back and forth across space for one mission or another and that adds up. I loathed having to go to another planet because of load times and those sequences. To the people that make those mods you deserve a cookie.

Multiplayer plays like a mash of ME-3 Multiplayer and the singleplayer for ME:A. 7 waves and 3 objectives. Mostly dead servers but there are people around. I recommend checking out N7Squad. A group that is helping to keep the ME3 MP servers alive with players. Honestly stick to 3.

Before I go any further with my thoughts on this game, I should mention that I have not played any other game in the Mass Effect franchise. I purchased this game heavily discounted, using it as an entry point into the franchise.

With that disclaimer out of the way, here are my general thoughts:

The first thing you notice is the quality of the scenery graphics; they are absolutely stunning in some places. The combat is always enjoyable and fairly easy, and the auto cover system is surprisingly nice. I would say that if you're not used to this type of gameplay, the learning curve to properly master the various combos and skill tree might be a little bit steep, but once you figure it out it is a joy to use. The story, while oddly paced, is also refreshing and original - it does a good job getting your hooked (provided you don't do too many side missions before completing each of the main story missions) - though I would say the game does rely more on side missions to fill a play through. Many of the side characters and companions are also well though-out and nuanced, with a complexity that is also interesting to follow along with. None of the companion characters are static, you get to watch each of them grow and adapt as you complete the main story. If you've played any other games from BioWare (not in the Mass Effect franchise), there's a lot of familiarity in the general layout - things are generally where they should be in terms of the UI (the UI is actually usable). In short, there is a lot to like about this game. If it's on sale for a good price, stop reading and get it. It's a lot of fun.


Still here? Now the parts I don't like...

This game feels about 95% done. In all honesty it feels like an early access release, despite it being five years old already. There are bugs - a lot of them. Cut scenes will infuriate you some times - be it lip synchronization issues, freezing, directX crashes, or even missing characters, you will at some point be forced to troubleshoot your game. Developer support simply isn't there to fix them - though thankfully there are many great community resources to solve most of the issues you will come across. 

I can't speak for those that have played any of the other Mass Effect games, but as someone who hasn't, I found it enjoyable.

TL;DR: A fun game with relatable, dynamic characters, an exciting story, but somewhat incomplete in terms of a final release.",1641713044,1641713044,True,23,0,0.638495981693267822,0,True,False,False

The good: 
If you are a Mass effect fan, you will probably like this game, it might not be as strong in story as the others (especially 1 & 2), or have the nostalgia effect, but it sure does bring you back to good times. 
The game knows its strengths and plays them well. 
The planets are beautiful to visit, and you can customize your own character and it has a lot of freedom in skills.
The game does look quite nice and smooth, even on my pc where I cant max it or anything, but I can get an overall medium graphic quality. 
I havent encountered any game breaking situations or a like yet ( as some reviews have said)
If you can get it for under 10 euros as I got it, its absolutely a steal, especially for sci fi fans.

What I dont like so much: 
The planets and side quests, can sometimes feel a bit bland and rushed, this game went through hell in development though, so im surprised it got as good as it got.
The AI could have been a bit better for how new the game is, it didnt improve much from the older mass effects. 
The straight up bad: 

For some weird reason, its super hard to change your 3 skill powers, its not user friendly at all, and even after using google, ive still not managed to be able to change them to others skills that havent already been used.

First I thought I was being stupid, and thought to myself..im probably missing some easy step, but after a lot of research I see that its not easy at all on pc, it requires you to make favourite profiles, and it just seems like a stupid design choice to be honest.

I'm new to the Mass Effect games, but I've recently just completed the original trilogy and this game falls short in almost every area except graphics.

I found this game boring and a chore to complete just because I bought it. The companions are not interesting in the slightest, the Krogran's come across as whiny in this game, for some reason all the female characters all have short hair and sound the same, and the worlds are empty but large.

The facial animations in this game are abysmal, looks like someone is trying, albeit poorly, to sculpt clay into a face. Really ruins the immersion.

In Mass Effect 2 and 3, the companions are very well developed and fleshed out with good stories and backgrounds, but in this game they are all generic and boring.

The story is mediocre, if you've played the original trilogy, just read a summary online of this game as it doesn't stem from the trilogy or influence it, this story happens between ME2 and ME3 600 light years in a different galaxy.

The main enemy in this game is the Kett, no depth to them or their goals in this game.

[b][u] The good:[/u][/b]
[list]
	[*] The graphics are good, some of the worlds especially look beautiful
	[*] Gunplay is somewhat enjoyable
	[*] New worlds, thus new environments to explore
[/list]

[b][u] The bad:[/u][/b]
[list]
	[*] Terrible story, predictable, choices don't really have an impact like in previous Mass Effect games
	[*] Poor character development. If you've played the original trilogy, the characters in this game are just trash. I didn't feel anything for any of them, after a while I got so bored with them that I would ignore them and their requests for side missions that were bland.
	[*] Horrific facial animations. I have no idea how this game is newer than the original trilogy, yet somehow the facial animations were downgraded in comparison. Maybe it's because they went from the Unreal engine to Frostbite, probably forced by EA.
	[*] The villain. Just doesn't feel impactful to me, he was a bit generic. He didn't invoke any emotions from me, I didn't hate him, I didn't like him, didn't sympathise with his cause, he was just a means to an end.

I knew I was going to hate the characters, I knew the dialogue was going to be cringe, and I knew this was going to up-end everything established in the original trilogy, but yet somehow the game still managed to disappoint me.

What this game succeeds at is purely in the gameplay with tons of side activities and exploration to keep you busy for hours, but everything else is a colossal fail.

---------------------

1. The worst aspect of this game is the story, the companions, the very narrative is atrocious, it has no personality, the world building is astonishingly vacuous. From the outset I cannot escape the feeling that I'm playing a low budget Topware RPG. Every line of dialogue falls flat, every character is soulless and moronic, I cannot even fathom how a fraction of the dialogue made it into the game.

2. I am a huge proponent for class systems, I enjoy building a character who plays and feels like he has a vocation, a battlefield role, and picking the companions that have the best synergy with my chosen playstyle, but the class system which was a mainstay in BioWare games has been done away with. This would be a point of contention, but I must admit I have had a lot of fun mixing and matching various abilities, and seeing what has the best synergy (OmGrenade, Turret, and barricade are my go to.) I would still much prefer a class system, but I can appreciate the route they went.

3. I don't normally like busy work in games, but I can really dig into Mass Effect Andromeda's side content and exploration purely on the basis that it gives me new things to shoot, and new things to test my character build on, and some of the locales you can visit are absolutely gorgeous.

The game is beautiful, the combat is decent and the worlds really give you that feeling of immersiveness. Almost all side quests have a meaning or a story that makes sense with the current situation of the people and that makes you feel like your reading a story and not just going after some items for an NPC.

The thing I can complain though, is (as a male to male lover) the lack of immersive options for romance.
Jaal seems to be the only one with a truly vast and satisfying dialog.
Gil is simply there to fill a hole, cause he barely talks. I would go after him after every big mission and that was usually nothing, and when there was something, was just it, something.
******Kind of a spoiler now*******





Reyes is and amazing character. I simply love him and actually chose him as my lover, but after his quests he simply doesn't say anything anymore and that's a really let down.

It succeeds on that space exploration feeling that I was looking for. Something to note is that the very start of the game feels empty and unfinished... because that is kind of the point, and your task is to fill the areas with life. Don't let that make you think the rest of it will be just as empty. The game's scope is pretty ambitious in this regard, as there is a lot to explore and unlock.

Do not expect this game to be exactly like the previous games and you might have a good time as well. The planets you explore look good, the combat feels great, and the new aliens that are introduced are quite interesting, albeit few. It might not have reached its grand ambitions, but what remained from the effort is interesting enough.

Some issues I did have:
- Absolutely do NOT play this game if you have photosensitive epilepsy. There were a couple fights where the whole screen started flashing black a lot when standing in certain areas, and this was most certainly not intended to be that way, and was hard for me to look at even without having sensitivity. There are also some scenes with bright flashing where it is intended. In similar manner to the screen flashing black, the main hub loading screen ""train"" has some lighting issue, the model flashed black for me, every single time I took it.
- As everyone already knows, the animations are super janky. These made me laugh out loud a couple of times, like when a character's head suddenly twists around like an owl. But generally, I tried not looking at the animations during conversations and just listened to the (pretty good) voice acting instead.
- The lowest priority quests are very boring gathering tasks with barely any reward. For some of those I had to gather/place items across several worlds, and the reward was the questgiver saying ""thanks"" and some experience. These sorts of quests could have just been removed, the game is otherwise big enough.
- Some of the squadmates you get act very strange, like Peebee and Liam. The writing seems to go for a certain vibe, but then completely misses the mark and makes these characters act super confusing. The rest I thought were pretty cool though.
- All the asaris seem to share the same face, and that face looks like it was stung by a bee. A large part of the characters overall have this weird unnatural facial roundness to them. And it stands out even more because some of the human-faced characters, like Liam, look good.

I am a big fan of the Mass Effect series, so rating this game is difficult for me. Very difficult.

So first things first: The game is not as bad as the first impression by critics and media may have made you believe.
The game is... decent. But it doesn't have the qualities that made the original series so great. The clash of the fan's expectation with the quality of this game created the negative reception by the community.

However, for the most part, I can't recommend this game - despite having played through it.
The graphics and combat are decent, but that's about it.
The biggest critical point is that the game seems... lifeless.

There is very obviously no love or thought put into the story or the characters. The original game series is... sexist, to be honest. A chauvinistic fantasy if you want to call it that. The female characters wear unnecessary high heels in combat, are genetically modified ""to be the perfect woman"" (Miranda), pretty busty (Liara) or ""rough"" (Jack).
Andromeda seems to have been developed under different expectations from management. It seems like management was too focused on correcting the mistakes of the past rather than create their own better version of the future. The heterosexual romance characters are visually closer to homosexual characters than what most people consider to be attractive in a heterosexual woman. That is not wrong in itself, but it made many male players less eager to engage with those characters, contrary to the games before. The characters also seem to be selected to appeal to younger people. All of them look and behave childish or young and are incredibly shallow. They make really bad jokes and overall suck. They make obvious choices and seemingly try to fulfill every cliché. It seems like Electronic Arts wanted to appeal to a young audience, but failed to do so, thereby also disturbing the fan base. I would always choose an Admiral Anderson over a f'ing Jacob/Liam.

The worst thing about this is the villain and the story. The villain just SUCKS. He has no deeper motivation, unlike the Reapers. He is just a puppet and the basic enemy type stays the same through the whole game. I really, really missed conflicting, difficult or ingenious characters like Saren, Sovereign or the Illusive Man (Cerberus). There is no serious moral conflict.

The NPCs are just boring and lifeless drones and the lack of (facial) animations just does the rest. 

The game is also suffering from the ""desert-disease"" which many open-world-games these days suffer from. The world is huge... but feels empty and dead, because it lacks secrets, easter eggs, love, detail and richness of content. You have to travel vast distances and wait through long loading times and when you finally arrive at your destination... it feels like it wasn't worth going there in the first place. There are a lot of quests, but none of them are meaningful. Most of them are just fetch quests (go to A, get B and then deliver it to C/destroy A and then go to B). Management probably wanted a ""hip open world game"", but failed to understand what makes some of them good. There are too many quests in this game to complete and it also doesn't feel like it is worth it. I would rather have few and enjoyable quests and invest money to enable them to make the next game ""bigger"".

I played through the whole game, hoping to find an exciting finale, but it never came. Don't waste your time on this game, expecting the game to get better at the end.

Moving on. I had a fantastic time playing this. I originally played it when it first came out, but I stopped playing like 3 or 4 main missions from the end. I had only played bits of the original trilogy and had no real connection to the games.

I finished MELE this year and for me personally, that has made this so much more enjoyable. 

I love the open world aspect of the planets you visit and the graphics are imo, excellent. I know for some people the facial animations are a bit of a let down, but I was completely unbothered.

The Remnant are super interesting as is the scourge. The Kett make excellent bad guys, but they are not even close to being scary like the reapers. 

The quests have excellent variety and the vast majority are entertaining and interesting.

Where do I begin.... the ""oh look how dynamic and fun and quick this combat system this is"" on NORMALi get melted out of cover. Weapons outside of the most powerful snipers (Black Widow and the angaran one) do zero damage, have no range at all; powers are useless all the same and the quick recovery speed with less weapon load doesnt help either. So one of the most dominating element is already not fun.

The exploration is a hit or miss: there are a few planets that look nice, I especially enjoyed the low-gravity one and desert one, but they all come down to the same big map with copy-pasted activites with nothing to do in between - not counting the random ""bandits"".

The story is passable I guess, but my main problem is (probably because I priorizited side-quests and companion-quests) I had a lot of backtracking. And I mean a lot. And all the unskippable animations/loading screens doesnt help.

Mass Effect without Commander Shepherd how could this be? well meet Ryder the Human Pathfinder on the lookout for a new Home for humanity inside the Andromeda Galaxy. The game is beautiful, the graphics are phenomenal and the combat system is the most fluent then any of the Original trilogy the fact you could mix Ability's was absolutely Amazing. 

The story was Meaningful however I did not connect with them as much as i did with shepherd, not that is the issue i just felt that Ryder lacked  personality and the same with the squad mates i mean come on Garrus, wrex, even Jacob had more personality, however the story was Ok it had a beginning a middle and what was that ENDING? 

now i understand the game had its support Pulled however, It left the ending Open, with the quarian Ark still missing and what seems to be a new bad guy rising, which i guess we will now never know about due to the end of support for the game due to the very shaky sales and reviews that plagued this game.

The game has gone through ten major patches since release, improving its weak points (like animations) and fixing many of its well-known bugs. Additional content has been added to both multiplayer and singleplayer, and bonus items are included in this deluxe edition.

At the original full price, ME:A very much falls short of the hype in early 2017. But at a reduced price today, and maybe even at 1/10 of the pre-order price, thanks to sales, the game is more than worth the money. This is a bargain for 100 hours of AAA game content.

It is obvious now that many areas of ME:A, such as facial animations and story, lack polish. Some bugs are still present. Mutiplayer games are difficult to find without a group of friends. Though with three friends and a little bit of patience, MP can be a fantastic coop experience.

However, the core gameplay has received widespread acclaim. Combat makes Andromeda one of the best third-person shooters to this day, and the deep customization gives players incredible freedom to play their own ways. The enjoyability of characters and exploration can be debated, but at the end of the day, even if all dialogues and side missions are skipped, the game is still worth its heavily discounted price.

Altogether too many bombastic cut-scenes; this game would need a cut-scene if one of the characters scratches his nose. 

Not crazy about the menus and navigational interface, which are cumbersome.

As far as narrative and romantic RPG elements, it's a miss. Bioware seems to have lost the art of RPG writing and romance around the time they forced their woke agenda into the mix. Even looking at it objectively, the writing and romances are clumsy and insipid. Perhaps talented writers cannot fake what is not to their tastes.

But once this game opens up and lets you take the reins, it really opens up. It's a very satisfying third-person shooter. The positives far outweigh the negatives, because the bottom line is that it's simply fun.

To be honest, MEA is more along the lines of what I thought The Outer Worlds should have been. The Outer Worlds, however, was a wretched and unbalanced disappointment, while this game is very compelling for the exploration, gear, and challenging firefights.

The kind that plays twelve hours a day on weekends and still get four to eight in on weekdays. Since starting Andromeda, I finished the entire Mass Effect and Dragon Age series again.

There is so much wrong with story and gameplay, especially the basic logic of who was chosen to get sent on the andromeda mission, it is atrocious. The vast majority of charackters I meet, manage to take me out of the game sooner or later, because they would nether have been chosen to be sent. Most good charackters are the natives, because they can be whatever they want, without breaking the logic of the storyline.

I just cant anymore, my face is too tired :P 
I just hope that I will at some point manage to finish this mess, si I can be done with it and never play it again.

Edit december 29th 2021:
I finished it at last and it is worse than thought. There are countless graphical and mechanical bugs. I'am not listing graphical ones due to number, but I will name a few example for the other one: At least three instances of broken quests, which had been known to be broken for years and did not get fixed in the the ""deluxe"" edition, for example the quest where you have to defeat 15 remnant bots. Kill the big destroyer bot before you killed 14 and it bugs out. You have to wait, in some cases over a minute, for numbers 13 and 14 and the mission is on a timer. Another bug was the angara leader  suddenly existing twice in her office, both fully functional. Another was the nomad spawning in an indoor vault.

On a positive note, I did grow fond of some charackters. I also never felt this relieved after finishing a game. I mean, I'am finally done and that means I can get rid of it like its a sickly child in old Sparta.",1638625959,1640818952,False,2,1,0.522349953651428223,0,True,False,False

You are placed in the shoes of a character that is tasked with finding a new home for humanity and alien allies. In my opinion I think that this game was very fun and is a break of fresh air to play instead of my usual FPS addiction. Personally I have never played the original Mass Effect trilogy, but I think that this game is really enjoyable. It has its fair share of bugs and glitches, but what game doesn't these days, if you look past that it is really fun. I liked the gunplay and the powers you could have and perform combos. The campaign was well written and it had me at the edge of my seat at the end. I absolutely love the scenery of the planets and liked that they all were different, and made me feel like I was actually exploring planets and not a dessert like most games relay planets. From my 2 play-throughs of the game I enjoyed the game and never finished all of the side quests, because I was so invested in the main story plot and missions. This game was a fun game that was relaxed but semi challenging. I think that this game was quite good but not worth the original selling point they ask for. The reason I say this is not because of the actual game itself but because games that are rooted in campaigns normally do not deserve the price of a triple A game.

It's much more enjoyable than I remember it being. Maybe the market was simply saturated with the genre and it didn't innovate enough to stand out.

Combat wise, it's a solid title.
Missions are diverse enough and has the option of doing Tasks for people who like to do tedious things as well.
Immersion is great.
Dialogue is more of a miss than a hit as the game suffers from general weak writing and generic virtue signaling. 
Plot is a little weak and inconsistent. 
Characters are inconsistent because the writers can't decide which way to go with their writing. It's comedic at times and serious at others without much reason. Instead of bringing variety to a character, it makes the writing feel clumsy.

Also most the mods for this game require a mod manager that doesn't even work on certain hard drive formatting. The profile system seemed super cool at first and your abilities have seperate cooldowns but you only can get 3 abilities and it gets old pretty quick honestly, made even worse by the terrible AI of squadmates that will die over and over again. Also I guess they decided that the pause/give orders system was just way TOO HARD and dumb for people so all that is left up to the AI as well who you guessed it are terrible with the powers. they got rid of a lot of the homing properties on some powers as well it honestly is just so bad I can't even. The game doesn't even tell you that enemies scale to your player level, which has always been the dumbest sin any RPG can do because takes half of the satisfaction away from progression because scaling enemies kind of makes that non existent. I beat every mass effect game on insanity multiple times but this game the enemies are stupid bullet spongey as well. 
Also if you like the free roam and open world you begin to hate it as soon as you deal with the life support system. Its so damn annoying and makes no sense. your dad can make an AI that literally changes your DNA structure but we cant make life support systems in armor for cold or radioactive environments? I could understand small areas being lethal like this but honestly the 2 planets I went to this is pretty much everywhere and the stupid AI will absolutely never shut up about how cold it is or the radioactivity. if you're in a drawn out firefight with enemies where you will likely have no cover in the wide world and your life support goes down its just really absurd especially because the other alien enemies don't get effected by this.

- the game looks beautiful, and with a couple of mods you can get a decent-looking Ryder as well. 
- the combat is smooth, probably the best out of all the games in the franchise
- for a mindless fun, this game is good enough. Nowadays the bar is pretty low, so with this game having a beginning, a middle and an end (in other words, being a complete experience) you could say it's decent enough. 
- some planets have interesting quests. Kadara was my favorite. On Kadara I've also met the only character in this whole game who I thought was interesting. He even had a short romance available for a male Ryder (that's a plus for me personally).
- character Peebe, or what was her name... the assari companion was actually useful, providing a cute combat robot. 

The Butts:
- it is not a ME game. The story was written on post-it notes by schoolchildren. Some of them had probably played previous games, while others merely googled them. Yet, in their arrogance these children thought they could make the ME universe better by removing or changing things they didn't like. And so the unique krogan and salarian cultures were butchered, turned into a grey mass of individuals with no distinct features aside from minor cosmetics and voices  (I suppose, it is what the 'cultural revolution' is ultimately aiming at but no matter).
- I mention the post-it notes because the tone of this game is all over the place. Way too often it jumps between a silly comedy and a gruesome tragedy. Ultimately, nothing feels like it has any impact because the post-it notes for the story were glued together in the last moment. 
- the dialogue and characters suffer the same post-it effect. Phrases quite often don't match tonally, often ruining any remaining traces of immersion.  Major characters seem to be devoid of set personalities. What is Jaal? Sometimes he is an awkward geek, while simultaneously flirting with everyone, while simultaneously sounding like a tired old man. Which brings me neatly to the next point... 
- whatever your Ryder does won't matter.  Unfortunately, you cannot kill anyone, not even slap them, not even scream at them or kick them out of the team. This is very frustrating, given how many irritating characters this game has. 

I could go on for a long time... Having played ME 1-3 way too many times, this game is utterly disappointing to me. I cannot recommend it for anything but a mindless shooter experience.

Explore the new galaxy, fight the unknown threat and discover new things. And I think that I couldn't wanted anything more than the mass effect (story-driven/ RPG elements) combine with no man sky (exploration mainly).
You can get all of that feeling in this game, a perfect sensation of that feeling.
This is a good game despite its problem. 
Yes it couldn't be compared to the trilogy. But it has beauty in its own way if you look closely enough (with open mind). 
All of the system, setting, design, etc. All fit in together, and its immersive enough for me to take in the roll of a pathfinder. To pioneer and find a new home in a new galaxy. Even though a lot of side quest seems empty, pointless  and make no real impact in the game world.
That seems to be the same with your party member. All stereotype different character that you expect to find in a team : the troublemaker, the brute, the genius, the mechanic or the soldier. It's so generic with little to offer compared to the trilogy crew.
But even with all of that said, I still found myself engage in the game. The weapon customization offer a lot to experiment on, the combat is repetitive but offer a lot of play-style that suits you the most. The main story is interesting and I like this plot of a new pioneer in the new frontier a lot.
Overall : Just don't think that this is mass effect sequel, but think about it as an arpg/ story-driven/ choice matter game about exploring into the unknown galaxy. Trying to find a new home for your people in dire situation. Explore the new galaxy, fight the new threat, discover the secret of the ancient remnant technology. It's a great game to immerse yourself in. And I couldn't find a game with story and setting that execute this good anywhere else (Please recommended me if you got any).

They launched an unfinished product and the sales were not what they had expected. Despite that, they still did make a good profit on it and, financially, the game was not a flop. It didn't stop the greedy publisher's knee-jerk reaction, though. They patched out the worst issues to shut up the loudest of the critics and then they shut down the developer studio. The result? Paying customers were left with a barely fixed game and the story forever incomplete.

All that said, I still love Andromeda. I've played through it four times so far (on Origin, so my Steam play time won't reflect it) and I'll honestly say: by no means is it a game as good as any of the original Mass Effects. And yet... there is something about it that makes me want to come back to those characters and those worlds, flaws and all. There is warmth around them and I love how hopeful and uplifting the overall storyline is. 

The areas are beautiful even though they are frustrating to navigate sometimes. Fortunately, discovering all fast travel points makes that into a non-issue. The underground vaults sure are repetitive, but each has enough of a unique twist to keep me engaged. And the thrill of outrunning certain death at the end of each one never gets old for me.

Even the final tease about the bad guy's comeback and the announcement of the Quarian DLC - neither of which will ever come - is acceptable if you take them as an open ending. Sort of a ""we won today, we will win again, life is good"".

I could probably write more here, but I'll just sum it all up with this: Andromeda is a flawed game, but if you give it a chance and don't demand perfection, it will give you a lot of heart and interesting characters to meet.

-Unpolished

The pacing is a bit weird, and some of the 'logic' driving the plot is... thin at best.

I always said ME1 was my favourite of the original trilogy, just for the feeling of exploration, discovery and adventure.  I tend to like hopeful narratives of discovery.  This feels like that, with tangible feelings of exploration and progress.

You travel to a waypoint, see yet another group of robotic enemies gathered around some black pillars, travel to another waypoint, kill some space alien humanoid things in one of their camps, repeat.

Overall, it is my second favorite Mass Effect Game. They had to change it up and try new directions, and for the most part it meshes a great combo from all previous games.",1639552540,1639552540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is much more fluid, as is the upgrade tree. No longer are you forced to make a 40 hour commitment to a class that might get tiresome after 10 hours. No longer are you required to stand behind cover and spam squadmate abilities inbetween your cooldown times. You can jet around combatt, engage enemies from different vantage points with a multitude of abilities. You can create the ultimate tactical gameplay using your abilities. The main downside is you can only pick from 3 active abilities at a time on hotkey, so even though you can get 15 powers, you can only commit to 3.

The story is basically a Reapers Lite concept with a backdrop of exploring the unknown or it's a Lewis and Clarke style adventure set against a Reapers Lite backdrop. Either way you look at it, there's not too many grand stories you can tell to triumph over saving the Galaxy from genocide. You can only 'save the world' so many times before it becomes a cliche plot point in a story-driven RPG. There's always going to be some bad guy who wants to destroy the world your character lives in. That's a Bioware staple, and its fine and fun because we only get these games every 3-8 years.

The characters are obviously not comparable to a trilogy of characters, nor as detailed as a trilogy of characters either. For the most part characters are either really well done, have too famous of a voice actor, or just exist. There's very few, if any characters that make you groan. I personally didn't like Reyes or Vetra, and did my best to cope with being someone who can easily recognize voices. I swear, half the voice cast comes from HBO's 2015 top shows.

Yeah the graphics can be awkward; the facial customization has somehow gotten worse and Turians look like they're made out of clay. But they're still decent for 2017 and provide for beautiful and harrowing landscapes.

The research and crafting system kind of annoys me. It tries to be DA:I but with just too much going on. Having to build the same weapon 3 times just to keep up with combat was annoying. The whole leveling and combat scaling also annoys me. As I reached level 35 and up, my abilities just kept getting worse, and became unreliable. My combos were becoming ineffective against enemies that they dominated from levels 3-30. I maxxed out those abilities early, and they didn't really get buffed past that despite weakening without being fixable. But that's really my only combat complaint.


Overall, this game is a decent way to kill 40 hours, especially if you buy it on sale. The combat is fun, the story is solid enough not to detract from the game, and overall this isn't the huge turd in a sandbox that everyone, myself included, whined about when it first released.",1639516282,1639516282,True,1,1,0.440639257431030273,0,True,False,False

Saturday morning cartoons have better characterisation, ironically written by actual adults as well. 
EA also partake in necromancy, wielding the shambling corpse of Bioware, freshly risen from the dead, as some sort of insignificant minion butler designed only to serve the whims of their necromancer overlord. 

If ubisoft is the benchmark for the average, bland cookie-cutter open world format, then EA is responsible for watering it down to a liquid cookie paste that will never be fully baked, much like the developers behind MEA, or the investors at EA behind the developers behind MEA.

Big problems: 
1) The game would just randomly minimize: This happened maybe 3-4 times, once when a friend logged into origin and the others were just random.
2) The game would randomly quit back to the main menu: This happened twice and the second time is what sent me over the edge.
3) Any scripted events like drop ships were just wonky, looked like alpha build more than an actual build: For example, a drop ship came in with AI frozen like statues on it, the drop ship flew in, stopped in its tracks, then did like a 90 degree turn and moved towards its scripted position. Just really under developed.

Smaller Problems:
1) Customization: I feel like there was no additions/innovations done to customization and I feel like its even less than what we had with ME3.
2) Story bits: I won't say I know the story but from the few things I do know, its just not really fleshed out. For example, Ryder Sr. says he was working on thinning the enemy numbers and proceeds to blow up a few lightning rods. It doesn't kill anyone though and then the gang moves forward. Nothing in that scene makes any sense.
3) Controls are a bit wonky but I'm not going to fault them since you can remap things but the controller is just not a good layout for this one.

So weekly, I have to peel off the addition of this just to reestablish it the next week.  All in all though, fun.

Pros:
1. Fast-paced, mildly challenging combat (I've died maybe a couple of times on normal)
2. Three different combat/skill trees to pick from
3. A variety of if-then selection options to the story; I'm not sure how much impact these truly have on the game, but more effects the style of play
4. Fast travel; and when you're NOT travelling fast, you get a vehicle...  that allows you to scale mountains (mostly)

Cons:
1. You have some back-and-forth quests; go here, then there, over there, and back to here

The upgrade system is bare bone and overall the number of assets is limited.

Characters are of interest, although there are several far-fetched plot arcs. The main story also feels convoluted in places.

This is the first game I played and it really captured my attention, just staring, wondering, experiencing what the game had to offer to me. Some said its not required to play the last three to start with this but I'll be buying the ME: Legendary Edition soon to experience the full picture soon.

[h1] The Pros [/h1]
1. Game has a lot of planets to offer albeit some of them you can't land on due to being inhabitable, there's enough to explore for hours on end.
2. Combat system feels fantastic, seamless transition of style while exploring will make you able to adapt quickly when needed.
3. Squadmates. They sure did a hell of a job making them say a lot of interesting dialogues, and the romance is just a purely amazing experience, and I won't forget their help in battles. [spoiler] I romanced Cora, who wouldn't love a badass partner with a soft-side [/spoiler]
4. The facial animation and major bugs seems to be fixed, afterall, this was released back in 2017 and I played it on 2021. Game had a rough start based on my knowledge.
5. Lot of aliens to meet, they also have interesting dialogues as the game's story progress deeper.
6. Environment looks nice overall, although I have some complaints which I will include in the cons section of my review.
7. Lots of guns, armors, consumables, etc. to suit one's style.
8. The game offers moral choices which may have a lasting impact on the next installment in the franchise.
9. Tons of side-quests, loyalty missions, and the likes to keep you busy for hours and provide some decent lore about what happened.
10. The feels. The game will definitely make you feel emotions, be it anger, satisfaction. Just play it to know it!

[h1] The Cons [/h1]
1. If you wear bulky clothes like the remnant ones, [i] which is the style I prefer [/i], there'll be some cut-scenes where their hands will glitch through your armor, breaks the immersion but take it or leave it I suppose.
2. The potential for outposts to have visual upgrades were not met. This is honestly a wasted potential, I hoped that when I finish outpost related quests it will receive visual changes as the game progress, but no, just the plain. Doesn't even put the relocated people in there when you choose to put them there. Such a disappointment.
3. Romance. When you reach the end point its just-meh. Doesn't feel like there's a relationship, they don't even hang-out in the pathfinder's quarters. You talk to them like before, no special passive dialogues. [i] Other games do better and no its not a romance game, take fallout 4 for example. [/i]
4. Population, you would think that after releasing people from cryo-pods and saving their arks that you will see a population boom, well, no. The game only add just a miniscule amount to the people and on the outposts.
5. Even after you finish side-quests you can still hear the settlers complaining the its still not fixed, which is annoying since there should be development and not retaining the complain dialogue.
6. The planets doesn't change visually like the one in the ending cut-scene where Eos should've had more plants, well, no again. Which is disappointing AGAIN.
7. Some dialogues cut-out even though they haven't been done talking, and some dialogue repeats over and over. [spoiler] like from Ryder when in the nexus talking about the Angara. [/spoiler]
8. Forces you to use Origin game launcher from EA, like come on, I bought this on steam, I'll play this here without third party interference.
9. Animation. I feel like it lacks some animation, in idle, talking, and just the overall feel I suppose. Feels wonky at some areas. 

But I still do recommend this game. I only wish they took their time and not rushed the game, it could've delivered much more I think. But the publisher is EA. And you know EA and how they're hungry for money they are. I do suggest buying on sale though.

The new engine could have been an opportunity for exciting, visually stunning and unique alien worlds, but unfortunately we get generic desert, ice, jungle and temperate worlds.

It could have also been an opportunity for a really solid, respected engine to make Mass Effect gunplay feel less clunky... but it doesn't, and what's more it generated game breaking bugs that literally would reboot my computer without warning at any time. Madness from a AAA title!

Can't really recommend, as while there are some nice character moments it just can't compare to the original trilogy, the storyline, gameplay and game stability are all fairly poor and the facial animations are often bizarre and off-putting.

I gave it a good chance with a full playthrough, but large chunks of it felt like busywork rather than anything meaningful. Andromeda has some interesting moments and there were flashes of the much better game it could have been, but all in all it failed to deliver on the epic legacy of the main trilogy that did everything it does, but miles better.

I can reccomend this game, it has by far the best gameplay in all mass effect games.
Its refreshing to play a more inexperienced character over shepards military rambo background.
You have some more abilitys when responding now seeing they added the ""disney evry1 crack jokes"" option.
The contrast between crewmates is way more diverse now aswell though they do remind you off older crewmates.

The story is great as far as you can expect it.
Its a step up from what mass effect became due to having way to many writers, looking at how bipolar some characters wer and how simple others.
So i geuss they got somewhat used to to many cooks in the kitchen.

Warning spoilers ahead: 

The sad part is there is a underlying storyline all about the reapers and why this project came to be blablabla.
I dont wana spoil to much but all i can say is it ties into the original series happenings up to the point the ships left.
I understand it but i wish it woulda let go of the original series completely, and it was clear they wer setting things up for a big reveal later on in the franchise.

The main story however is solid enough its a basic mass effect game.
Cant really expect to much from the story with Drew not being there, again look at the shortcommings of earlyer games when he wasnt there or barely.
Like compare ME1 writing to ME3 for example.
But if ME2 and ME3 was good enough for you this will be to, hell its still better then most games out there.

All in all its a mass effect game.
If you can look past how poorly it released and the fact that its not Shepard or the old team then depending on if you like the characters this game will be for you.
But liking the new characters is up to you and you cant go off other peoples opinions but your own.

No community recommended fixes work and I'm just stuck repeating the same segments.

Do not buy this, it's not worth the frustration.



EDIT: In hindsight, despite my frustrations with some bugs, the game was good. Alot better than it was at launch. It's a shame that there was never any follow up because the premise of the game is stellar. It perfectly slots itself into the story of the original trilogy while being it's own thing.

The dialogue is alright. It doesn't really have the paragon system from the other ME games.
Combat is a ton of fun. It's more fast-paced.
As another reviewer said, PC controls are really unpleasant. I played with an Xbox controller instead (much better). 
Another reviewer also stated that this is more of an exploration-style game. I completely agree. There is combat and some action, of course. But the theme is to explore and terraform the worlds you discover. 
Multiplayer is pretty fun. A bit bland, though. 
The Asari look so bizarre in this game vs the other ME games. They just look... different.

I recently completed this game and I have to say, it was simply fantastic. I can see why some people may be disappointed in it. However, I think that we should keep in mind that this is an entirely different story than any of the other Mass Effect games. Did I miss Shepard? Of course. But Andromeda does so much to create it's own story that I became immersed in it quickly. 
I haven't played the release version of MEA, but this version seems quite stable. I had a few strange bugs occur but not unlike any other video game I have played before. 
Overall, don't get so hung up on the differences. Instead, keep in mind that it is a different story with different mechanics. The characters are fun to interact with and they have funny little dialogues that come up from time to time. They're nicely fleshed out with interesting backstories and missions.

cons
- your choice little to matter,there are some choice that can effect the outcome of something but most of the times it just meh, it cant hold a candle with original trilogy.
- most of the planet only there to be observed.
- exploration in the explorable map not rewarding.( except vault due to collecting remnant data core mission, and havarl for one of the best armor mod )
- you cant slap foster addison face.
- same boss fight over and over again.
- cant go inside your ship without leaving the planet.
- for badass fighting craze race,most of the krogan sounds like sunday church atendee

pros
- cora's ass
- combat ( probably depends on your build ) is fun.
- i love the banter between squadmates somehow.
- the cutscene fight of nakmor morda its so funny i have to put it on pros, never laugh that hard during cutscene.
- cora's ass.

with many cons than pros i can think of this game somehow i enjoy my time playing it,probably because i realize this game supposed to be the baseline of a new mass effect series far away from the original trilogy,where somehow you can see the impact of your choice in the next instalment but its a shame it wont happens. im supposed to give this game thumbs down but that ass really turn thing around,its worth fighting thousands of kets and armies of remnant all over again.

I've put this off for awhile now since I was a die hard fan of the original trilogy. Hearing about all the changes in Andromeda from having only three powers to uncustomizable squadmates and tired faces had me leaving the Mass Effect franchise entirely.

But a sale came on and I was curious. Perhaps it was time I took Shepard down from the pedestal and tried something new. And that's the sort of eyes you need when you play Andromeda. You can't compare this to the trilogy or you'll be disappointed. On its own though, it's alright.

The gameplay is fantastic. Jump jets are a lifesaver and the snap to cover mechanic isn't as magnetic as ME1. The snipers are lacking though as on insanity I might as well be shooting nerf darts. However, gun types are now completely unlocked. Want to run around with two snipers on your back? Do it! Want to run around carrying shotguns? Nice!

Dialogue options are emotion oriented now. There is no more Paragon and Renegade. I've watched the videos seeing just how cringeworthy they can get but you don't need to pick them. The infamous ""break the ice"" facepalm moment can also just be another professional ""I'm Ryder and I'm here to help"" moment if you so choose. The game does have a certain narrative though. As professional as you want to be, the story does take Ryder from the big shoes to fill kid to the respected Pathfinder in the finale.

Which leads me to Ryder. Reviews were accurate when they said the Pathfinder role may as well be Jesus. Everyone looks at you and takes a step back, basking in your glory as they make you their next religious figure. Even the other Pathfinders you find don't help you out at all and instead prefer to chill out in a single room walking back and forth. Without you, everyone would be standing around trying to figure how to tie their shoe laces.

In this game, you're terraforming planets to make them inhabitable for colonists. I ended up playing 100% just to see what the game had to offer and I wasn't disappointed. Mind you I also play Elite Dangerous which some people have called the pinnacle of boring. Where some people would find the side quests tedious, I found it alright. Almost every planet has for lack of a better term a robotic thresher maw fight which serves as a boss fight. Terraforming each planet to 100% wasn't as tedious as I thought and driving the Nomad was much better than the Mako, even if it doesn't have a gun.

Heading over to the Galaxy Map, I can understand why some people wanted a skip option. It goes through a cutscene where you travel from planet to planet that you can now skip. Travel between solar systems is still unskippable.

Bug wise, I honestly haven't run across too much. I will say that I have had the occasional CTD but anyone getting this game needs to know that they are essentially buying a game that is bugged and will never be fixed. The modding community is still active and the MEA Fixpack alleviates this somewhat.

Speaking of the modding community, it is great. You can set the camera angle lower, uncap the weapon range limits, etc. not to mention the whole ton of aesthetic options that come with any modding community.

Overall, I had a blast. I would definitely recommend this game when it's on sale for the price of a fast food meal. I didn't think I would have as much fun as I did but it was most definitely worth it.

If you're into that kind of gameplay, or you're willing to endure some of it, or you can manage to overlook it; i think it's probably worth thirty bucks or so and a good cry in the floor of a hot shower.  if it puts anything i've said about the game in better perspective, it could be worth saying i've never played any other mass effect games except for thirty minutes or so of mass effect 3 on a friend's console because i really liked the way combat played out.  from what i remember of it, i rather preferred that one over this one.  i plan to buy and play some of the earlier games in the future because of how interesting i find the fictional technology they've created/used for this universe and with a bit of luck, i will be able to cope with accidentally building an in-game reputation as a lecherous hopelessly depraved space pervert, hell bent on unprotected sex with every suspiciously available organism in the galaxy.  did i say galaxy? obviously, i meant the universe.",1637946213,1637946213,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game suffers from the biggest problem a big breakaway sequel can have: it's not the original. Old players of Mass Effect come into it with the nostalgia built from 3 incredible episodes of an entirely different narrative and style of gameplay. New players come in missing the context and history of the Milky Way races, and the mystery behind the Initiative's unknown benefactor... but that's where the big problems end.
It's unfortunate this game came out with bugs and graphical problems (most of which were fixed) - it's unfortunate the Mass Effect community's let down cultivated a culture of diminishing this brave - and successful - attempt at creating something *new*. 
The gameplay, powers, and gunplay of this game is incredible. The design, artistically, mechanically, and UI is exceptional. The story is like the first Mass Effect game: not enough - I personally want more. I'm saddened that Mass Effect Legendary Edition came out before a sequel to this game. If you don't like this game, it's because the genre of the game isn't for you, or you haven't given it a chance.
Admittedly, there are flaws. Some of the voice acting could've been better, and the non-combat graphics are imperfect. But these are incurable reasonable results of a rushed production - another thing Bioware fans might be able to blame themselves for. Being an open-world game also has all the baggage you might expect - but every mission *makes sense* (as opposed to Bethesda games which have its protagonist doing quests they have no business doing).

The exploration, landscapes, and relevant characters are to be commended, and I liked the new species, and Galaxy that Andromeda brings to the ME universe.

This took me roughly 65 hours to beat from start to finish with 98% of the missions completed, so for the ""$1 - 1 hour"" rule you will definitely get bang for your buck. I also had moments when I wasn't playing the game, that I was thinking about it. To me this game really drags you in with the story of Pathfinder Ryder and their companions, which have very in depth backstories and their own missions to complete.

[MAIN CHARACTER]
Ryder is boring, period. Not the characters, nor even the writers seem to give a damn about Ryder. You go through the option of choosing your history that ties into your class ala old ME systems. But never, at any point, is it mentioned/relevant to the game. At least old ME would have characters address you depending on your history (""Oh the hero of ____, I can't imagine the hardship of _____"", etc.) and one ME even had it be relevant to a plot event via tech classes.

Here you could be an ex-member of an elite spec ops team that did covert missions in hostile territory, or you could be a botanist with 0 combat experience. Everyone still addresses you the same and treats you like you have no idea what you're doing. Not even Ryder themselves will bring it up.

Even up to the end of the game, despite what you've done, any praise you get from the various leaders feels more akin to a parent praising their toddler on a crayon drawing than for a man/woman that just saved millions from starving out in the cold grip of space. Why do I say this? Because outside of telling you to do the next quest world, everyone speaks to you like you're an absolute buffoon (and sometimes during too). 

Story-wise, it makes sense at the beginning what with how things start, but towards the middle and end after proving yourself over and over again, I was wishing for a renegade option to just take over things hostile dictator style just to solve a lot of irrelevant issues. Which brings me to the next problem.

[MORALITY]
The paragon and renegade system is gone, replace with what COULD have been an interesting system where Ryder can make more individualistic conversation choices (professional, logical, emotional, etc). 

On paper this looks awesome. Tailoring Ryder to make actions like an OC that I could truly have act like myself? That's the best thing ever!...except it changes nothing, unlocks nothing, and influences nothing. Ryder won't act more emotional, logical, or professional no matter how many of those choices you make and there are no options locked behind being one of the types.

Previous ME allowed you to choose to be a negotiator that tried to avoid violence unless absolutely necessary, or a space cowboy that shot on sight for anything that even slightly irritated them. This influenced the story directly and even how some fights turn out. Whereas in Andromeda, you could just mash through conversations not even looking at what you say and everything still turns out the same.

This is because the game's dialogue falls into the Fallout4 ditch, where no matter what you say the dialogue tree goes down the exact same path. (Story beats need to be hit, and goddamn it we are on the straightaway to them!)

[PLOT]
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's nothing new. Literally, the main antagonist/hidden ancient race are both basically the Promethean. The antagonist species assimilates races and takes the best aspects to add to their gene pool, those who refuse get wiped out. We literally hear from Javik in ME3 that that's what the Prometheans did. The antagonists consider assimilation an honor, Javik called it in an honor. The ancient race whose technology you chase after all game also developed one of the new races we encounter. The Prometheans did the same thing with the Asari. It was lazy writing with lazy attempts to introduce new aliens.

The story beats aren't any better. ""OH NO, WE NEED TO FIND A PLACE TO GO OR WE'LL ALL DIE! BUT WHERE DO WE GO?! WE DON'T KNOW ANYWHERE THAT CAN SUSTAIN LIFE!""...Except for several worlds you encounter that have already had outposts/outright colonies established by other ark's inhabitants, (even your own!)

The fact that you're called the ""Pathfinder"" despite getting to many worlds AFTER other people have already established settlements on them is hilarious. I think of all the planets you travel to in this game, Ryder is responsible for discovering maybe 1?

This review is long and I'm starting to lose my train of thought. So final words...

-No Quarians
-Every other race except for humans is oddly useless
-Pathfinders are NOT elite, nor do they have to be
-For a space game, there is a definitive lack of space people.
-90% of everything about this game is rehashed material

The launch in 2017 was an absolute mess, I was there. Over the years, patch after patch the gameplay has improved a lot but my one main gripe with this game is the repetitive narrative. I have completed only one run on PC after coming from PS4 and whacking the difficulty up to insanity. Difficulty aside, the game can be fun at times during combat, difficulty definitely adds to the intensity of firefights and they can be genuinely fun (disregarding (SPOILERS) that one mission when you go after the Salarian ark and you're stuck onboard a Kett cruiser in a big room with the ship's broadside batteries, because no matter how hard and how well you play you are going to die repeatedly trying to clear it out on insanity unless you are god himself). However, at the same time the game manages to be incredibly tedious and long winded, very repetitive in the quest styles and that is why I sat on a save file where I reached the final main quest for the better part of a year until I completed it yesterday after putting the difficulty down. I don't hate the game, but it burns you out very quickly. Games like Fallout 4 suffer from the same awful questing and narrative but the reason I personally can go and put hundreds of hours into a Fallout 4 run is because there's so much variety, so many ways to play that game even on survival difficulty. You could go for a stealth melee character, a long range marksman character, or you can just throw caution to the wind and go for a power armour playthrough. The quests may be awful, and there are glaring issues with the narrative (e.g. Having four main factions in which whilst supposedly having great influence you cannot actually do anything with that influence in the factions you wouldn't be able to do if you literally just joined that faction regardless of progress in the story) but you can make it fun. You can't do this with Andromeda on the higher difficulties. You're either a biotic powerhouse or you're roadkill. So why do I play, even now that I'm writing this review I have the game open with the intention of starting a new game plus run to re-learn the game? Because it is beautiful. The scenery in this game is honestly second to none in my opinion, the graphic design work behind all of the different factions fit in well in my opinion and really bring them to life, and the planets and ships are stunning to look at. I am a mass effect fan, I have played all of the games, perhaps I'm biased in my opinion on Andromeda's graphics design and styles, or maybe it really is just that good. It's the feeling of this game that brings me back aswell I guess, I want to go to a planet and get ambushed by a Remnant Architect again for the first time, and while at times it may seem mediocre at best, I am a fan of the witty banter your squadmates will have between each other on loyalty missions especially. 

Should you play this game in 2021? Well, there's not much time left in 2021 to really play the game fully, but if you don't mind going into the new year, the poor writing and repetitive questing (and that damn Salarian ark quest), then I would recommend this game if it goes on sale again (judging by EA's current business model I'm not sure there even will be an again but watch for one over the holidays). Why have I slated this game and then recommended it to you? Because for a first time playthrough of the game it will be a good experience, clunkiness and lazy writing aside.

It went down to £6 in a sale, so I thought screw it, why not:

Turns out its actually one of my favourite things I've played all year. 

For a start, it actually captures a Star Trek like feeling of exploring a new galaxy, with all the wonder, fear and curiosity that entails. This isn't so much an epic space opera, more an open-ended sci-fi adventure in a brand new slice of the Mass Effect universe, and tbh, I love it for that. The environments are huge, varied, and ripe for exploration, the graphics are actually excellent (particularly in regard to art design), although as many have said before the facial animations are a little stiff.....who cares. The atmosphere is superb, with the Nexus (your new Citadel equivalent) feeling warm and familiar, while the alien planets feel suitably weird, wild and dangerous. Oh, and the shooting mechanics? Nice and chunky, with plenty of fun upgrade options.

If you enjoy the idea of screaming around the universe, encountering weird alien tech, exploring strange ruins, sniping bad guys on ice planets and hunting alien beasts in jungles...this game is probably going to work for you. The writing is honestly not that bad either, and there is a familiar camaraderie within your ship and the crew you pick up along the way that is recognisably Mass Effect. It feels right, for the most part it looks great, there's tons of content and I've had a blast exploring around, with tons of the game still left to go at 36 hours in. 

Don't listen to the naysayers. For what its worth, I think this is not just an excellent sci-fi adventure, but also a worthy Mass Effect game. Hardcore fanboys will disagree. But then, don't they always?

Go into it looking for fun, and to explore the unknown. It is most definitely there.

Three main reason why:
1. The characters are very, VERY boring and annoying. Each party member brings something to the table.  Headaches, migraines, and bouts of sudden nausea when they speak. The only one who didn't grind on my ears was Drack.

2. The Galaxy map is stupid and a step back compared to the previous entries.  Every single travel cycle between planet, asteroid, scanning poi is accompanied with a ridiculous cutscene (which you can skip after a second) traversing to it. This is further exasperated when landing/exiting a planet. The cutscene is UNSKIPPABLE. Oh it's fine to see a few times, but this game is filled with backtracking which makes the annoying factor go up because you have to wait to see your dumb ship land/take off.

3. Your crafting of weapons and armor is bogged down in a convoluted menu system which is a pain to slog through. There are games twenty years ago that have better crafting menus than this!

There are other issues involving sound glitches, video lighting issues, character animation issues (lack there of anyways) pacing issues, there are times where my frame rates dip into single digits!

Do not buy this. This is a bastard entry in the series and should be left alone. I am glad I didn't pay full price!",1637166486,1637166486,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My Comments:
1. There are plenty of voice over interactions between the crewmates.
2. Many planets to explore, and couple of maps in a planet. The joy is in seeing different planets.
3. The scale, the atmosphere and the settings are well done. Seeing the changes in the environment is nice.
4. Plenty of side missions to do. So much I simply skipped. Some are quite a chore.
5. The equipment list have been expanded alot. It was a bit disorienting at first. But in the end, I only pick the most efficient for High Damage. 
6. I just read up some spoilers. The decision in main mission will affect the late game, but personally I didnt felt the impact. And there is only one ending :(
7. In comparison to prev ME, they have expanded the map sizes, side missions, equipments and backstory. Introduced a new species Angara (which could use a model tweak, the concept looks okay). 

Some notes:
1. I have no much issue with the facial expression, given the amount of the cutscenes, it seems applying generic expression is more cost efficient. 
2. I would prefer a more streamlined story focused cinematic gameplay where decision affect the later scenario. Hence, if the efforts and time are spent on making the story missions longer / bigger. Say, a ratio of 7:3. I think it will be a more memorable experience. I will likely do side quest if only they provide an advantage in gunfight or improvement on the ship/nomad. But usually they don't, and I felt its like something that can do without.

This game is much better than everyone said it would be. I think people were expecting Andromeda to be the original trilogy, and it isn't; the tone is very different. Ryder is much less experienced than Shepard, and the theme of the story is all about being in over your head. The scale is smaller too; it takes place in a single star cluster, not an entire galaxy.

The gameplay is a lot of fun and the graphics are really nice. I know a lot of people complain about the animations, but honestly, I think they're fine. My biggest problem with the game was that it's a bit longer than it needs to be. There's some unnecessary padding, and the traveling cutscenes are way too long (even with mods to shorten them). Some of the characters are a bit flat, but overall, they're interesting enough. Your crew is certainly more interesting than in ME1.

+++ Positive +++

+ Combat, mobility, diversity of weapons and tools, possible combination of powers etc.

+ Lore and universe, despite the main story being a bit weak, but you can not really compare with a full trilogy

+ Exploration: If you like mako expeditions from ME1, you will like the nomad trips, otherwise, there is the Iron Man mod...

+ Some great environments

--- Negative ---

- Backtracking kills the pace: way too much backtracking. If you suffer from ""i need to complete all secondary quests"" syndrome like me, you are going to suffer so much because of the heavy backtracking in that game. You think you have finished all quests of a planet or place: wrong, you are going to come back there several times, sometimes just to talk to a single NPC, and each time you will have to suffer from all the animations (taking off, landing etc.)

- Tedious animations when switching between planets, sending probes, taking off and landing. Makes the backtracking even worse

- Facial animations are bad and voice acting is not always good, it does kill the immersion at times

- Some mods are IMO mandatory, I installed them even before playing for first time, and i can not imagine playing without (MEA Fixpack, Shorters cinematic, Hyper mobility, better squad, fast mining, quick loot, Nomad max speed...)

Is it as good as the original Mass Effect trilogy? Kinda.
Is it better then Mass Effect 1 and 2? No, it's not a good sequel.
Key phrase: ""Not a good sequel"". That being said, if you come with low expectations you will have a great time.
Companions are relatable and interesting (except Cora) and side quests are overall very good. Main story isn't amazing but the ending beats Mass Effect 3 by a long shot.
Gameplay is improved from Mass Effect 3, it's a lot more fun, the sounds are meaty, the guns feel impactful and the abilities are somewhat balanced.
Character Creation is about equal to the ME trilogy, but that isn't saying much.
Exploration is very fun, the terraforming mechanic could be improved but it's overall really fun (better than those tank missions on Mass Effect 1)
The plot twist is okay and the side quest of discovering what happened with the reapers is amazing.

But I have to say, this game is a ton of fun for someone just starting out in the series. Sure, the character animations are a bit stiff, the Humans have zero facial expressions, and Liam can get a bit annoying (just roll with Vetra and Peebee, can't go wrong), but gameplay-wise, the game is tons of fun.

Is the story bad? Perhaps. It's all about what you're looking for in a Mass Effect game. Adventure? Check. New things to see and do? Check. This is a good game to start off with as a new player to Mass Effect as a whole. You aren't Shepard. You're Ryder, and you're brand new to your job, and this new Andromeda Galaxy. You aren't a pre-established war hero. Ryder is yours to develop into whatever type Pathfinder you want him to be. Please don't let another review's statement saying ""It'S nOt ShEpArD"" talk you out of playing this game as a new player to Mass Effect. You don't NEED Shepard or Garrus or whoever else Shepard fucks in the original trilogy to make a good Mass Effect game, people...

Lastly, the multiplayer. Yes, this is an EA game, so there's microtransactions galore in the multiplayer, but you make MP Credits so fast here, it doesn't take a whole lot unless you REALLY want a specific character.

I'll leave you off with a few questions to ask yourself, and my personal answers for them.

Q: Is this game fun?
A: Yes! A blast!

Q: Is the story good?
A: That depends on what YOU want from a Mass Effect game. I'll say yes as a new player to Mass Effect as a whole.

Q: Is the multiplayer toxic?
A: Not really, it's all co-op. No one has a real reason to get pissed at someone unless you or they are really salty someone isn't pulling their weight.

Stand-out positives: 
-Dialogue is great, and the characters have significant depth in terms of personality. 
-Romances are well written, on that note. 
-Combat is quite fun and can get your heart racing at times. 
-Overall settings are very nice looking and the nexus is pretty cool.
-Story itself is decent from the outside but feels meaningful based on the characters and crew its told through

Stand-out negatives: 
-The open-world just doesn't work for a whole galaxy. It just feels silly warp-jumping across the galaxy 6x an hour to run errands. And on the planets themselves, outside of main quest missions the whole place feels very empty with the same 3 or 4 types of enemy encampments just kind ctrl-C+crtl-V by whoever was setting up the place- a shame given how nice the setting is. 
-As fun as combat is, 95% of fights can even get repetitive when you get the hang of it- just pop up from cover, take out one enemy, duck until shields recover, and don't get flanked- works even on hardest difficulty.
-Character animations often feel fairly robotic. PeeBee is really the only one with body languages, and facial expressions as well as lighting just make characters feel very much like, well, video game characters

Otherwise lives up to its predecessors (so far), with added mystery and thickening plot keeping you on the edge of your seat all the way. Can't wait to check out the plethora of upgrades I just picked up on the first mission. You can carry loads of stuff but I haven't figured out how to find it yet because I've just been blasting my way through the first mission lol, which was amazing on a 4K monitor with my Q Acoustics speakers, as is a lot of other things. Once you get stuck in it's a good shooter with a good storyline - and it's Mass Effect. Nice

UPDATE: This has all the makings of a great game and you can see the developers have put a lot of work into it. Problem? It's so boring. Too much pointless and uninteresting dialogue and running around not really doing anything. The action is good, but too infrequent. You can literally go days running around the place just talking to people and passing messages without getting into a gunfight. Yawn.

TLDR in advance, the writing/story telling is just fucking awful and boring and cringe. I wanted to like it, but it's ass.

Far too much exposition type shit for my liking. I've read ME1s entire codex and enjoyed it, information was staggered and always felt relevant. In this I feel like you're just blasted right away with codex shit, audio logs, journal entry/data pad stuff, random npcs you're supposed to talk to. Like bro, interest me in the world before you expect me give a shit about all of this exposition bullshit. 

Also Character creation is terrible, ME1 has way better character creation. And really all the humans are just ugly and unpleasant to look at. So doughy. Ew. Turians look pretty bad too I think. Speaking of looking bad, a lot of the cutscenes look pretty shit. Like the perspective is screwy and everything in space is obviously really small model scale stuff when you're flying to the weird lightning planet in the beginning.

Dialogue is shit, your dialogue options suck ass, it feels like you just get 2-4 ways to say the same thing slightly differently most of the time, and you're always nice. Let me be an asshole, game.

Somewhere saw somebody making the argument that characters are boring in mass effect 1 since you haven't had your bonding time with them yet or whatever so this game shouldn't be judged as harshly as it is for having boring characters since they've only had 1 game to develop. That sounded pretty logical to me before I bought this game. After playing it for a while though, Jesus Christ, that is pure bullshit. I was far more interested in Garrus, Tali, Liara, and even Ashley (sorry Kaiden don't really care about you) when I was first playing ME1 even though they don't have that much dialogue relative to the other games. In Andromeda these ugly dough faces just go on and on and on about shit and I don't give a single fuck about anything they're saying. Can barely even tell blonde lady and turian lady's voices apart in the nomad. I wanted to like this game because I wanted the virtual turian gf experience quite badly but god, the writing. With the amount these assholes are blabbing the fact that I still don't find any of them interesting is obviously an issue with the writing, not the time I've spent with them. With Garrus and Tali I was interested in them as soon as Shepard met them.

CONS:
Fewer than you'd expect. There are some lingering bugs that should have been squashed but don't really get in the way. Gameplay is a bit repetitive, but it has that in common with most other games in the genre. The devs cheaped out on models for non-human races, and that, along with the weird body positioning and some of the animations, are my biggest complaints.

PROS:
The story is fun, the writing is at least on par with the original trilogy, the voices are excellent, environment and vehicle designs are quite cool, and the worldbuilding and relationships are compelling and engaging, all of which made the original Mass Effect games great (up until the end). The game mechanics, though a little too simplified, are stellar when compared with the original ME. 

I played on normal, and found the fights a little too hard for the setting at first, and a little too easy later on, so it might benefit from additional balance and scale. Overall, more than worth the money. It's a shame that EA is so heavilly cash focused. The push to wrap ME3 left a lot of players sour, and the disappointing reception of Andromeda (due more to bad PR than any fault in the game) put them off a direct sequel. That shouldn't have happened. 

Players wanted more. The setup was there. The storylines of the Quarian ship, the strange Benefactor, the Kett homeworld, and other loose ends should have had a followup. Andromeda made bank, and EA simply mismanaged it into a disappointment. A familiar feeling for ME fans. The solution wasn't to bottle up the franchise, it was to deliver on their promises, a lesson the game giant has never learned.

I've played for 70 hours, finishing the main story and most of the side content, and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It's still a little buggier than i'd like, but nothing major.

The Game has a crafting system that lets you collect raw material from various sources and craft them into weapons and armor. The recipes have to be researched using research points that you mainly get from scanning environmental objects. You can add mods to change the behaviour of your weapons or the traits of your armor, allowing you to tailor your gear to your playstyle. You can also find or buy gear, but it will not have mods in it, so the crafted gear is really worth making.

The combat is much more fast and mobile due to the mini jet pack you and your team are using. I have been using guns mostly, but there are biotic and engineering powers and talents that support these playstyles as well.

Concerning the content itself, the story is good enough, but it is obvious that this game was meant to set up a new series of ME games, away from the original trilogy. Many questions remain to be answered in future games. The story is focused on exploring a new galaxy and setting up outposts there, with no major surprises.

Comparing the game to its predecessors is a good way of ruining your enjoyment of it. There is a reason this is not called Mass Effect 4. I find what's there to be enjoyable.

I found myself stopping to clear camps I didn't need to fight just because I wanted to charge in and nova them all.

The graphics are beautiful especially with the Dolby Vision HDR.

The story was clearly written to setup the Andromeda galaxy's story for another series of games. It's engaging for the most part, but doesn't feel quite as dramatic as the original trilogy. It leaves some of the most interesting plotlines unsolved. Clearly they intended to explore those more in DLC or future games focused in Andromeda. That's probably the worst part for me. Not knowing if we'll get answers to so many of things you learn by the end. I feel a lot of people unfair ding Andromeda for this. It only had 1 game to develop plotlines and characters compared with 3 in the trilogy. 

My biggest complaint for Andromeda is the number and repetitive nature of so many of the ""task"" missions. Even with how hard I bought into the story of the pathfinder solving problems in a new galaxy I felt like some of these were draining. Most are fine, but a few make you go all over the place and seem to take forever. Fortunately they are all skippable and most don't really add to the story in a major way.

Overall this is definitely worth the money. Especially since it can be bought on sale for under $10 now. I just finished one playthrough at around 80 hrs. I'll definitely be doing another.",1635197419,1635197419,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many aspects of this game should be compared to ME1, which was also the first of a trilogy (I doubt Andromeda is getting a trilogy, but sequels were definitely hinted and most likely canceled now due to internet outrage). 

A prime example is people complaining about the 'bland' squadmates. But let's be honest, a lot of squadmates in ME1 were also bland. 

-Liam is no more bland than Kaiden, and with Liam you also add in the fact that you, and even all your squadmates hate him. That aspect alone makes him more interesting than Kaiden.
-Cora is a mix of Ashley and Kaiden; a human biotic with family issues, who was frankly much more likable than Ashley.
-Garrus was literally just a standard C-Sec officer with a vendetta against Saren, and Tali is a walking codex entry for the Quarians. Obvious comparisons would be Vetra and Jaal respectively; both with much more personality and fleshed-out loyalty missions.
- Dr. Lexi and Chawkwas. Chawkwas has like 2 lines in ME1, Dr. Lexi meanwhile has a ton more dialogue and interacts with the crew.

I can think of a ton more examples but you get the point. Too many people are comparing Andromeda's characters to characters from ME3; characters you've spent hundreds of hours with, tons of conversations with, loyalty missions, arcs, and romance. It's simply not a fair comparison, and I'll admit I didn't care for Andromeda's squad at first, but they grew on me; just like the characters from the trilogy. 

Gameplay is the best it's been in the series. Combat is smooth, powers are fun to use, and Ryder is more mobile than Shepard could ever be. Don't get me wrong, I still had fun with the combat when I replayed the Legendary edition, but it still feels dated compared to Andromeda. I really missed my jet pack and dash.

The Nomad is easily the most fun vehicle we've gotten in Mass Effect. It's literally just a better Mako, and the guys from Need for Speed helped create the vehicle and it shows. It's a ton of fun to use, and the maps aren't crap to drive around in unlike ME1. 

Graphics are amazing, easily the best-looking ME thanks to the Frostbite engine. Performance was fine for me, I can easily achieve 60+ fps on a GTX 970 with a mix of high/ultra settings. Didn't notice any major bugs or glitches either.

However, this game isn't without it's faults. The writing took a nosedive, and it's laughably bad. So bad that it's kind of funny in a way. Same with the animations, though they've definitely been improved since launch. These are big issues but I find an easy way around them; don't take the game's writing too seriously, just have fun with it. For animations, you can just keep the helmet on your characters. 

Story isn't anything great either, a weaker re-hash of ME2. The big-bad is a meme compared to The Repears. It's just a pretty average story that could have gotten better with the canceled DLC.

And that's the biggest disappointment of this game; the canceled DLC. I don't want to spoil much, but it would have given us many missing species from the Andromeda galaxy that I would have loved to see. Would also be curious how they continue the main storyline. Alas, the internet crybabies won and EA abandoned Andromeda.

Overall, Andromeda is a solid, fun game that gets unfairly compared to an entire trilogy. If the game looks enjoyable to you I highly recommend giving it a try!",1635117458,1635117744,True,2,0,0.469696968793869019,0,True,False,False
1238000,101552449,76561197999053154,0,5,3919,0,3565,1635203386,"I'm honestly torn about this game, but also have 60 hours into it at this point, so it can't be all bad.

The pros are many: the world in ME:A is fully realised, interesting, and well thought out. The main story arc feels really epic at the beginning, and settles down to just pretty good later in the game.

The cast of characters feel much more varied than in the main ME trilogy; there were characters I actively disliked because of their personalities and motivations, which was a new experience for me, but one that comes with really solid story telling and commitment to those characters. I think this makes it a solid plus.

Male Ryder, on the other hand, feels a bit generic, lacking any of the decisiveness of Shepard. He comes off as an aww-shucks-well-I-guess kind of person, which feels strange given his position and role.

ME:A also drops the Paragon/Renegard morality choices that the main ME does, and I think that improves things a lot. I liked the idea, but too often I'd make choices to maximize my desired score rather than the one that felt right, since higher morality scores unlocked more dialogue options and abilities.

Combat is done well, and can certainly be more challenging. It's a bit grittier than ME, with really explosive animations for headshots on organic targets. The jump boost and hovering makes for a fun extra dimension as well. Jumping in general is a really nice addition to the game (years in the future, but only now do we get to explore ... the third dimension!!). It can get a bit frustrating with the sometimes janky movement of Ryder, but overall it's fun and feels very futuristic.

So far, so good, but what's bad?

The UI is really, really inconsistent. ""Go back to prior screen"" is either Esc or Space, but switches without any real rhyme or reason. Similarly ""Skip this [X]"" is either Space for most cutscenes and dialog, or Tab if you're travelling between planets.

Speaking of travelling between things, prepare yourself for endless cutscenes when landing on planets, or moving between planets / solar systems. The first time you see one, they're amazing, but they can't be skipped, and they are very frequent since there's a lot of back and forth between sections. If the elevator transitions of ME were frustrating, these are far, far worse. They are fixed-length, and won't cut short even if you have top of the line hardware to load new levels quickly.

Lengthy delays seem to be backed into the game on multiple levels. Interacting with objects isn't a simple ""press key"", it's ""press-and-hold-key"". If you're in a hurry and let up on the key too early, you'll get a timeout penalty before you can try interacting again. It's a stupid mechanic. The worst example is in Kadara port, where seemingly normal doors take forever to open, for no reason. You'll be passing through those doors a lot, which makes it worse.

The model and voice designs for the characters were frustrating as well, feeling less crisp than ME. The Krogan's head plate now looks like whipped marshmallow fluff rather than spiky bones. Salarians don't talk in that fast-paced, clipped style of ME, and Turians don't have that cool voice effect. It makes all the aliens feel less alien and unique, just a bunch of soft-looking people who are only distinguished by their accents.

Finally, the level design is wanting. Land on Kadara port, take the elevator to the slums, and marvel at the 3 inch high rock that blocks you from walking forward as soon as the screen loads. You'll get a chance to marvel at it 30-50 more times as you have to revisit this area over and over. Or you could marvel at Podromos, which is built around a small lake you can't swim across, forcing you to run laps over and over again to get to where you're going.

Stupid annoyances like the ones above abound in the game, and really feel a bit like sandpaper on your brain. For that reason, ME:A feels much more grind-y than the other games, even taking into consideration ME:1's endless Mako tours of obscure planets.

Overall, I'd recommend the game. Like I said, I have 60 hours into it so far. But prepare yourself. Everything from the character models to the story feels less crisp, and small stupid choices in UI and transition screens makes it less enjoyable.",1635081413,1635081413,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mass Effect: Andromeda is properly gorgeous.

Having played the prologue, I've been introduced to the premise and the new setting, given the characters, teased on the threat, and introduced to the revised but familiar gameplay of Mass Effect. The highlight so far being as stunning world entry set-piece breaking atmosphere on what I assume will be the game's first of many worlds.

At a glance, the gameplay is improved over the original trilogy as well, with loads of skills to dump points into and develop, and a much improved speed and maneuverability to the player character.

NPCs do look a bit pasty compared to the rest of the beautifully textured environments which is a little distracting. I'm sure before too long I'll see some bugs. But 3 hours total and I'm sold. Andromeda is very big, very inviting, and most of all very Mass Effect.

It was a new experience for me, as I didn't spoil it for myself throughout the 4 years, out of sheer disappointment when I heard what a letdown it was. But now, since its been years, I figured ""why the hell not"" since Mass Effect 4 is not gonna happen anytime soon.

So I thought the EA or Bioware would have fixed all the bugs/glitches by four years, but nah... Thankfully however, the glitches are only on optional, non-important stuff... to be exact, the mining atctivities. Aside from that, I had no issues with the game quest and all.

The story itself was quite good, and while it may not be on par with what the main Mass Effect trilogy had going, it was epic and interesting in its own right. I'll just say that it gets cooler past the 70% mark. Before that is alot of introduction and fixing stuff, which for me is fine, but some may be turned off by the grind. 

The characters were mostly likeable, and had backstories for you to explore. I just felt they could stretch out the developments for your character and the side characters as well, because I felt like most of them either developed too fast, or were abrupt. Maybe its just me, but the main Mass Effect trilogy didn't have that jarring development speed. Ah well. I think some side characters' developments were done better than the rest...

I finished the game, and from what I've seen, I do hope that this game ties in with the main trilogy. Although, the 600 years difference makes me wonder if even if they do tie in, would that mean new characters for both Andromeda/Mily Way galaxy crossovers?

[quote]It took me years to play Andromeda. Even stated that Mass Effect is, behind Metal Gear Solid, my favorite game series. (Followed by Dead Space.) When I finally decided to buy Andromeda, I bought an Origin key from Amazon for $7. I played it for roughly 30-40 hours. I then unceremoniously decided to stop playing. (I was somewhere on Voeld.) Something hit me like a wall of bricks. I realized I felt disconnected from what I was doing. I had essentially dismissed the game from that point on.

And regarding the technical issues conflated with the massive negative critical reviews at launch, I felt justified. When EA came back to Steam, I said... fine. So I bought Andromeda... again.

What became apparent upon starting this game over was simple: [u]I wasn't ready to forget Shepard.[/u] — I wasn't ready to have the Reaper invasion, Cerberus, the N7 Alliance and C-Sec become bullet points on a historical event timeline.

I've long held the belief that Shepard was an [i]anybody[/i]. That they represented a singular human that did what they needed to  save what they could from impending doom. Ryder simply didn't have the same feeling. Not at first...

In any regard... I love Andromeda now. And I can say that without any caveats.[/quote]

[h1]Passing the Torch.[/h1]
I'm going to give a listed synopsis of the premise and introductory events to avoid specific spoilers.[list]
[*] Jien Garson creates the idea for the Andromeda Initiative before the events of Mass Effect 1.

[*] The Hyperion [Human] Ark leaves the Milky Way after the events of Mass Effect 2.

[*] — 634 years pass.

[*] You, Scott [or Sara] Ryder wake up from cryo on the way to Habitat 7 due to the ship getting stuck in something referred to as “The Scourge” — what is described as a “Dark Energy Cloud”.

[*] [REDACTED] occurs which ends in you becoming the new Pathfinder for the Human Ark. Subsequently this position involves having an AI in your head. Called S.A.M. or Simulated Adaptive Matrix. [spoiler]One link back to the Milky Way is that SAM is theorized to have been conceptualized after the events of Project Overlord. A DLC for Mass Effect 2.[/spoiler]

[*] The Hyperion links up to the Nexus [ostensibly the new Citadel] and you discover none of the other arks have arrived yet.

[*] As Pathfinder, it is now on you to establish a foothold within a foreign galaxy whilst searching for the other arks.[/list]

And because of this, the pacing of the game is completely different to that of the original games. It's essentially up to you how you want to get things going. Structurally, you go on your ship [The Tempest], talk to your crew mates, go on missions and... explore. Same loop. But there is [i]effectively[/i] no impending doom. The Reapers are not coming to obliterate any and all organic things. There is a main threat, but it's been going on for a long time and isn't really time sensitive. [Not yet anyways.] However, your arrival has acted as a catalyst. Imagine.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2294875182
If you're more inclined to the seedy underbelly of Omega, Kadara has you covered. With resources tight on the Nexus and the other Arks missing. Unrest was inevitable. It's not just the “local fauna” you'll need to deal with out in Andromeda. 

In fact, leadership on the Nexus itself has been in strife from the get go. Kesh, Tann, Addison and Kandros all try to subtlety manipulate the Pathfinder. Lack of resources and stress affects people differently. You might notice many of the other species were left back in the Milky Way. Saved for the second wave. Curiously, when pressed — and perhaps paradoxically — Tann cites technical problems with the Quarian Ark as to why they're not in the first wave.

The main difference in Andromeda is that the combat is vastly improved even from ME3. I make the contention that the combat is better than 2 or 3 and not ME1. As ME1 did not have poor combat. It simply was a different genre. It was a much more of a pure RPG. Whereas now it's much more based on action.

— [b]But there is still tinkering to be had:[/b]
As you explore your galaxy map, you select which planets to go to and land on. You have a vehicle now called the Nomad. Which is both upgradable and customizable. At times this makes the game feel a bit like ME1 did when exploring with the Mako. — which is really nice. Although some planets are too small and condensed for that kind of travel. Such as Havarl — an Angara jungle planet. 
When you perform tasks that make the planets you travel more sustainable for life, you get AVP [Andromeda Viability Points] which allow you to wake blocks of citizens from cryo and subsequently aid you in your quest to colonize the Andromeda galaxy.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2294875167

There are three new species you'll find within this game. The Kett, who serve as the main antagonist. However, I got a distinct “First Contact War” vibe from some of the interactions. Referring to the first contact humans had with the Turians. — The Angara, a wide spread species within the Heleus Cluster. And lastly, a slightly more enigmatic synthetic species referred to as “The Remnant”. SAM is able to interface with Remnant technology found throughout the galaxy where no Angara has before. Or Kett for that matter.

[b]Mechanically speaking, it's a relatively standard, well made third person shooter.[/b] You can level into Tech, Biotics or Soldier trees which will further level any associated profiles that SAM can use to add buffs — Sentinel, Vanguard, Adept. I went heavy into the tech tree and leveled the Engineer profile which increased damage of Tech powers and Constructs. You can prime targets with tech and biotic combos for heavy hitting damage. Though, if you do many of the side missions, you'll be able to craft a pretty well-rounded Ryder.

Andromeda embodies 'passing of the torch' in every way it could be interpreted.

You're no longer required to build up paragon or renegade points, a system I never liked. You're not limited by dialogue options for not having a certain reputation. But there is plenty of romance, so don't be afraid to flirt or you might miss your chance.

[h1]Rationalization of menial tasks.[/h1]
This is something I find myself stuck in ambivalence regarding. This sentiment is also shared for Dragon Age: Inquisition. Both Inquisition and Andromeda share a similar idea in that the very premise of the game is such to impress and/or assuage misgivings about the protagonist's presence. And there are quite literally hundreds of quests to go on. Doing one often leads to more. “Find my missing family” — “Help me figure out who is committing sabotage” — “Find my missing supply shipment”. So on and so forth. Typically, these tasks are not that interesting and become tedious rather quickly. However, they actually do serve the premise narratively. So I have a hard time dismissing them. They actually [i]are[/i], narratively significant. And they culminate to a nice moment. 

[i][b]THE GIST:
As an avid Mass Effect fan, I was heartbroken when this game first came out. Now that I've played it. I can say it's a great  Mass Effect game with an even more grand premise — Exploring a brand new galaxy. The soundtrack is there, the characters are decent. They grow on you. Drack is probably the first Krogan I ever actually liked. 

I'm excited for the remaster and looking forward to see what's next.[/b][/i]

I will admit it - the game's combat system is so good it can [i]almost[/i] earn a begrudging thumbs up from me. Everything feels fast and fluid, you have more maneuverability than ever before (and it fits in thematically just fine), the variety and flexibility of class and power choices lets you play however you want, unlocking powers and leveling up abilities usually is quite a good feeling, and landing your shots and abilities feels viscerally satisfying. Enemy variety is depressing, however, so all your combat prowess is spent beating up (mostly) combat dummies. If they would have had more depth here, I would have considered the combat of this game good enough overall to carry it as a successful title - because the rest of the game is pretty disappointing.

Combat aside, Andromeda is all about quantity over quality. There's probably a hundred hours of ""content"" here, and it's pretty much all hollow and forgettable. Sure, you'll fly around the galaxy, scan planets, read codex pages, talk to important movers and shakers of alien races (and maybe yell at them a whole bunch), discover some cool ancient alien shit from time to time, and have a [i]bangin[/i] team of larger-than-life alien characters to do it with, but it all feels hollow, like we're just going through the motions. A repetition of things done before out of habit, rather than desire. Andromeda mimics previous Mass Effect titles at a surface level, never exploring or fleshing out anything or really feeling like a personalized touch was taken with the development and writing of the game. I felt like everything the story had to offer was formulaic and repetitive, and very little of it [i]added[/i] to my experience rather than just take time to keep me doing something. 

The [spoiler] Ancient AI[/spoiler] discovery is a great example. [spoiler]AI[/spoiler] is a huge deal in the Mass Effect universe. Why was this major theme flirted with and not explored further? The previous ME titles were like a good sci-fi novel: they had a story to tell, but they also expanded your mind and made you think about new things, or old things in a newer way. Why don't the devs entice me to [i]think[/i] about sci-fi stuff like previous ME titles did? Why is the main antagonist of the game basically a Mr. Potato Head of bad guy tropes? Why not focus on developing the excellent action game(s) you are obviously moving towards and launch it as a new IP instead of stuffing it into a Mass Effect trenchcoat?

In my defense, I can say that I simply cannot continue on with this game as I have lost all interest and will, so I have to give an honest look where I am today.

Most people focuses on Mass Effect Andromeda’s bad launch as the main source of criticism, that have been mostly rectified by a number of patches. I played this game now 4 years after it’s official release plus I installed around 20 mods to enhance the experience, ranging from various non-lore breaking improvements to looks, customization and combat tweaks. 

But even with these, Andromeda unfortunately is a very shallow one-dimensional experience that comes nowhere close to it’s predecessor Mass Effect games. This is even more apparent due to the Mass Effect Legendary Edition release. So what exactly is wrong with Andromeda?

[b]Into the Unknown[/b]

Bioware chose the easy way out with Andromeda, instead of continuing with the complex original story of Commander Shepard, we jump to a different galaxy lead by the Rider protagonist brothers, who are Pathfinders to new worlds. Right off the bat, this both sounds an opportunity to create an own sub-franchise of Mass Effect (like with Final Fantasy) and also for the new Bioware team to introduce fresh ideas. However, what came out of the barrel was an opportunity utterly wasted. 

One of the biggest issues concerning Andromeda is its terrible writing – which keep it in mind is a critical aspect when designing a space epic action-RPG. Nearly every character was written without aligning with its race, culture or position in society. Krogan would talk like it was written for a human character and say phrases like “two birds with one stone” or use sophisticated explanations. Asari don’t act like they were Asari and every other character alien character is just seems off by large margin, which you have never felt in previous Mass Effect games where every race was distinct with their own cultural representation. It seems that the dialogues were written by some young intern who never seen the source material. 

Early in the game you meet some indigenous friendly race who starts speaking in their own language, but then 10 seconds later they change to English without a hitch and explanation. When talking to random traders or bystanders of these aliens (who never speak on their own language ever more), you feel the same thing, as if the dialogue was written to random human archetypes and not a distant alien race that have never met humans. 

This really destroys any immersion that the game would offer, combined with the poor story that is just borderline uninteresting and nonengaging. Speaking about uninteresting, let’s talk about the Riders.

Now, the Rider brothers (your main character) are not Commander Shepard, and that’s all right. But instead of some interesting personality, they wrote the most boring, generic teenager dialogues as possible. Role playing in this game is impossible as there are no more Renegade/Paragon options, instead you have these “mood” answers, but literally ALL OF THEM are he same with some slight variations, without any freedom of choice or meaningful decisions. This supposed be an “RPG” game keep it in mind.

Your party members also suffer from poor writing and misalignment with their race. You got a shy Turian huntress, your typical starter black dude guy, the strong soldier/biotic woman, the Krogan warlord, and an Asari scientist who by the way also is kinky/crazy/weird. If this seems familiar, that’s because you have seen similar lineup in Mass effect and even in Dragon Age. Probably Cora (your atypical strong female) is the only mildly interesting party member, but the rest are just fillers or borderline weird, suffering the same poor writing as said before. 

[b]So with all this said, at least how the open world feels?[/b]

On large planets you have a nice Open World setting where you can explore with your Nomad (your Mako), establish outposts, gather resources and solve side quests. On paper this sounds fun and the locations are sometimes breathtakingly beautiful, however it quickly becomes a chore. Half of the map cannot be accessed due to environmental hazard, outposts provide no actual meaning or things to do, resources are just too few to actually craft anything meaningful and side quests are just boring elimination or fetch quests. A vast open space without much substance.

Even checking Remnant ruins (mysterious alien civilization’s ruins with hostile automated robots) which undoubtedly look cool, but ultimately end up quite uninteresting and honestly pointless – other than restoring the hazards and fulfilling the main objective.

[b]So how’s combat? [/b]

I used some mods to enhance combat, better jump and tweaking damage, but still it felt rather un-engaging. There is a lot of verticality and movement, for sure, but it does not provide depth rather than just “looking cool”. There is really not much tactics that go into each engagement and it is always the same. You can switch on different Profiles (basically class) and use certain skills but I never felt the real need to do so as every combat engagement (regardless of the enemy types) are the same. There are no hard counters or enemies that are immune to certain damage, or need to use some tactical pattern to defeat its armor. Brute force always works. Thus, Its too easy, you just gun down everyone, while your retarded party members (even with Party mod installed) stand and occasionally do some minor stuff.

The big baddie enemies are also just there, chilling in their bases, to be a punching bag and never really offer any meaningful resistance or plot explanation. (Maybe later in the game, who knows)

Andromeda’s only redeeming quality is its location design and generally graphics look great, the engine serves its purpose well. Galaxy map and space travel is nicely done. But honestly, that’s about it. Numerous other issues from the console design, like bad inventory management, a tagged-on Multiplayer that no one plays, weird load-out and party management and many others plaque the experience. 

With all this in mind, [b]Andromeda seems like it was made by somebody who have seen Mass Effect from a poster or some screenshots and was like “I can do something like that”. It’s a shallow imitation of the Mass Effect universe with atrocious writing and a chore gameplay.[/b]

I can understand some respect for the game, from someone who have never played Mass Effect before, but if you did, then Andromeda has nothing to offer you. It is not a terrible game but it’s one where for many-many aspects you just want something better, and in a fact we had something better, it’s called Mass Effect Trilogy. If this is what the future of Mass Effect looks like, than thanks, I’ll just go back and replay again ME: Legendary Edition where you have everything that Andromeda does not.

After learning about the galaxy and meeting all its denizens, plus the combined stories of 3 games, it is hard to grasp at Andromeda as another ME game when all we’ve known is “forgotten” or “erased”

However, a new galaxy, a new game, I believe that this was a wonderful idea which wasn’t executed as it should have been. Some of the party members, about half of them, weren’t likeable or very interesting to me. The new species found follow humanoid tendencies which was a bummer, they could have done something much more interesting or different to show it was a new galaxy; same with several of the enemies found. 

The music was great however, visually it could be improved, but looked really good and the story itself is really interesting and left space to grow. Which probably won’t happen since they decided not to move forward with any DLC or support for the game. This is probably the biggest weakness of the game; working on it and adding dlc would have made it a much more complete and wholesome experience.

I recommend playing it because it is still an entertaining experience, combat is great, seeing how you can make the initiative overcome its hurdles and exploring new worlds is fantastic. Also because chances are that the new ME 4 will have some relationship with Andromeda, even if only in passing.

Andromeda in its current state is relatively patched up and it is a fun and functional game in the Mass Effect universe. Playing it for a second time after playing through Legendary Edition is a bit of a let down, as the animations are a bit more stiff and the setting feels a bit less organic. 

The characters aren't as memorable, but I didn't dislike them either. I really enjoyed Liam's companion mission, and I love Peebee's energy. The combat is fun and engaging, and I love the verticality added by the jump boosters. 

All in all it is a game whose potential wasn't fully realized when it was rushed out the door (and it was shipped full of both game breaking and silly bugs too, which didn't help). I'm kind of sad that this first game in an obvious trilogy will never have its story completed, but I enjoyed playing it for what it was.

It does not rival Commander Shepard's story but that does not mean it isn't a good story. I am hoping to get another game like this to continue on Ryder's story because I quite liked it and maybe it could attempt to finally do the story justice and use elements that made Shepard's story so great. I'm hoping I can actually watch the decisions I made in this game actually impact something since a lot of things are unanswered and a lot of decisions didn't really make a difference in the game which I think is a let-down.

While the voice acting and facial animations can be quite awkward at multiple times in the game, this game is a gem on its own. It has improved the combat from the previous games and I did enjoy the new scenery. 

I did enjoy talking with the crew and at times, I really felt like I cared for characters and I felt like I was working towards a goal. It is one of the big things I prefer in games: a story I can fight for since I hate grinding. There is a small grinding element with side missions. You can easily tell which side missions provide good additions to the story and which are for grinding (leveling up, extra gear, etc.) and I appreciated that. Albeit, some of the side missions that were grinding did have their own interesting story or information within the mission itself.

I really enjoyed the story overall. 

Overall: If you are looking for a nice Mass Effect game where you crew up with aliens and fight other humans and aliens, this is a good game.

I really like the gameplay and the setting of exploring a new galaxy, making first contact with new species. There's so much to do and being much more open it feels more like exploring a huge galaxy than ME2 and ME3 did. 

But there are flaws. The main character lacks a bit of charisma compared to Shepard and your companions are mostly boring too (except for Peebee and Jaal). And the story is good, but it's just not quite as gripping as the original ME trilogy story. And for some reason the initiative left all the good looking Asari back on the Milky Way and only took potato nosed ones with them to Andromeda. Not a major flaw, but still a bit weird.

Also, even though I mentioned the fact that there's a lot to do as a positive at first, it can also turn on itself a bit towards the end. It starts to feel more like a job than a hobby if you know what I mean by that. Especially some quests that have you hopping from planet to planet and then the next quest has you hopping from planet to planet again but in a different order. You end up spending too much of your playing time watching lift off and landing animations at this point.

Despite these negatives, I still really liked the game and hope for a sequel at some point.

But. And this is a large BUT. The first time I got a ""triple A game,"" long after the release date, and still vastly bugged. I mean ant hill bugged. Random sudden crashes, lip sync issues, heads spinning during dialogue, texture issues, fast travel confused with quitting to main menu (big ""wtf is this,"" for me), mass fps drops in some areas, a lot of simple shit that you'd expect to be cleaned up even after launch. I knew that there was bugs during it's launch since that was the constant issue with consumers but to see that clean up wasn't even attempted is astonishing. 

Oh, loot boxes... fucking seriously? Even worse you have to board the Tempest to update it, far more tedious and forgetful ffs MGSV had this figured out if your going to have microtranasstions.

Have not tried multiplayer, and like me3 and dragon age, will never touch it. Makes no sense to me with Bioware games with a larger single player emphisis. 

It takes about 5-15 minutes to load the game if you have to load shaders, and I swear that's what's causing my sudden crashes. I was suprised that there is no option to dedicate a folder for preloaded shaders, like I did with Shadow at War. I'll wait 20 minutes for a longer load time to ensure shaders don't crash/glitch the game any day. 

And worse of all. You have to use the publisher's launcher... I always, ALWAYS! have problems with any company that never made an MMO, garbage launcher. Always have to go into the launcher settings to make it work seamlessly, or reset my password because, well, I don't fucking use it. Stupid how that's forced upon consumers on PC. Imagine buying a pencil, but in order to use that pencil, you must call the marketing team of the company that produces the pencil, before you can use the pencil. Fucking stupid

Now. with shit aside. I can tell the devs were making another ME universe. Everything in game has that ME/DA feel, and adding that exploration that Dragon Age lead to is an brilliant addition. Especially with coming to a new galaxy aspect. Kett and Rem-tech were way to in-your-face at the start, yet were I'm at now they became illrevelant to story proggression. Less involved and the threat they are ""imposed,"" to be is... missing so far.  (I'm currently on the mission to find the, uh, the dude... with the ship or something Relationship Quests took the wheel on a hard left and right turn that left me forgetting about the main quest.) 

(((Minor Spoilers)))
((( still in first playthrough, just my  thoughts so far)))

There's a lot I like about the kett. Really reminds me of Riddick Chronicles with the imperial puritan empire thing. Transforming a being even down to the dna to obtain the ""ultimate race,"" deal. Weapons that really show their lack of care towards the destruction of ""lesser,"" races(in their terms). I swear they have a huge effort on T posing over others with their structures, makes me giggle every time, humorus characteristic that I appreciate.. Dahn is best weapon, FIGHT ME! Death ball go brrat brrat brrat and Nahladen go boom boom boom Hahahah hahahhahah aaaaahahaha *breath in* phew, sorry, inner demon got excited.

The angara, is a difficulty matter for me. Their race is full of lore bulletholes, how the fuck does a race ""forget,"" their entire history? If there is irl examples of this please let me know, but an intergalactic race just, forgets? Forgets first kett contact, forgets all of their history, forgets connection with remnant, just how? How does a whole ( AND ONLY) intergalactic race, simply forget? I'm worried when I find the answer it only leads to plot hole questions.

Remnant. I swear this is connected to reapers. Please for the love of the universe be about the damn reapers. If the their connected, I'll be happy, Very happy if the angara was their experiment. But, the fact the human patherfinder just ""knows,"" how to operate it is bullshit. I like puzzles, but the encryption puzzles can go fuck itself. Unlock keys go brr. (personal rant). It's something stupid isn't it? Please not be the case, I beg.

Is this really all of they new races? Mysterious Kett, mysterious remnant, dementia angara? and why do I regret saving that crazy angaran AI? 

I do like how the classes, abilities are easy to change and you don't have to feel commited to a class or skill tree. At first I screwed it up, naturally, but once I started to see what class style I want to play, its nice to feel forced to replay or restart for something I liked later or didn't know what it was like. Dashing is so damn fun no matter the class.

I find it strange that ordering your squadmates around not so important a big drawback. I like replaying ME games on insanity and strategy was very important, but here it's more on giving them high skills so you don't have to micromanage them, a plus but makes the position as SquadLeader forgetful. I feel that's connected with being way more mobile than older ME games.

I'll say again, never buy a game on launch, and wait for a good sale on any and all big game titles. Even if you love the series. I trust devs, not producers, and here is another example. Shame. Amazingly under-developed/rushed game perverted by marketing.

I wasn't sure about the squadmates personalities they did grew on me. Except Liam. Go watch a door or something just get off my ship. PEEBEE ONE LAST TIME, GET OUT OF MY ESCAPE POD!!!

In 1 week I've put in 47 hours, with the vast majority of that (25-30) in 2 days. As a fan of the orignal series, Mass Effect is a welcome brand. I haven't beaten it yet, but here my thoughts.

Game play loop:
Can be fun when you just want to push through the story. But, right now, 47 hours in, I'm growing wearing. It feels like it's not really going anywhere, plus the movement mechanics are kinda driving me up a wall. Same boring planets. Game just opened up a bit more again, however, I have to go through 3-5 loading screens to move on. Not long one's mind you, but 5-30 seconds, 3-5 times just to enter a loop of driving for 7 minutes, then maybe shooting for 2-5 minutes, then maybe some dialog for 2 minutes, then more driving for another 7+ minutes. All with those loading screens is just becoming unbearable. 

Characters:
Some are spoiled brats, children in the form of an adult, flat personalities, and generally not very interesting. The few loyalty missions I have played are great, like original mass effect quests, but there is not enough of that in the game.

Music:
Good. Nothing to write home about. It's not 3, it's not 1, it's not the hybrid of 2. It's not bad music, or even unfitting music, it's just music.

Graphics:
Good. Once again, in 2021, nothing to write home about.

Sounds:
Decent. Could be a little bit better, but not bad by all means.

Animations:
Funny. I don't think anyone working at bioware has ever seen someone walk. Or stand. Or anyone at all TBH.

Bugs:
A few. The biggest one is not hearing dialog because you entered dialog and you character couldn't keep up with you or is too busy running and grunting.

Do choices matter?:
Not really, but I haven't beaten it, and we probably won't get a MEA2, so probably not.

TL;DR

A good game, but it ain't mass effect as we know it. Don't go in expect that, and you might enjoy it.",1633328499,1633328499,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After I have installed few mods (+2 more skillpoints per level, weapon balancer, shorter landing animations, favourite skills swapper) game became much more fun!

Some sidequests are boring when you ahve to travel across the planet, some are superb ending with miniboss fights.

Compared to original ME trilogy, teammates are pretty much Jacob level (0 interest in them, apart of Jaal and Drack, who are like Thane/Garrus and Wrex) and they have nice chemistry in small talks :)

Seems extraordinarily rushed and suffers very badly for it. Some terrible script writing in a lot of places, voice acting is sub-par in a lot of places, the story is barely acceptable and doesn't have any of the gravitas of ME3.

Really not great at all.


Review revised after 45% completion:

The game suddenly gets a lot better and the dialogue stops making me want to punch my monitor repeatedly. Not sure why but something significant must have happened to the dev team.

Looks like my crashing issues were something to do with the anti-ailiasing mode i was using, i have literally no idea.

The Elaaden missions seem to be a lot better than the rest for reasons i can't explain. Maybe they are just more fluffy.

I'm now enjoying the game but what a slog to get here.

That said the story is not as good as the original trilogy, the characters are not as amazing as the original cast of the trilogy, and the main character is never going to even touch the legend of Sheapard.
There is the problem with this game. It is not up to the standards of the original trilogy, if this game was called anything BUT mass effect then it would had a better future.

Let me start off by saying, this game looks visually beautiful and the PvE multiplayer is great fun (probably the main reason to buy the game if any). 

Now that the positives are out of the way, I have a lot of problems with this game but nothing hurts it moreso than the lack of a personality. There are no renegade dialogue options, only 4 luke-warm good guy options, or maybe a slightly passive aggressive one. Ryder(new Shepard) is indecisive, insecure and pretty insufferable, it's not fun to play.

The facial animations are jarring even though the skin textures look beautiful. I'm assuming they used AI to map voice to facial animation as opposed to having real actors with motion trackers on their face, that's the only explanation I can think of because how unexpressive they are apart from an elastic mouth and occasional blink. That's what this game really lacked, proper actors, writers and directors, the first 3 ME games were cinematic masterpieces with each scene feeling pulled from a movie, but here even the voice actors are flat and lacking direction with unthematic tones. Andromeda quickly cured any hunger I had left for more Mass Effect story/lore. 

All the plot points are a bit too convenient, aka the writing is terrible. Both plot points and NPC dialogue break immersion and believability to the point where you just need to cringe and grit your teeth to get through them. The NPCs don't act like real people, their motivations aren't real, and the Nexus (new Citadel) feels so lifeless. In place of a real personality they just made every NPC angry, slightly annoyed or edgy and it gets old really fast, again uninspired writing. This game takes itself way too seriously, and tries to make conversations ultra 'deep' and emotional every chance it gets.

All of this would be fine to play as a parody Mass Effect game, but even then, it's not fun. The UI symbols are small, confusing and hard to see, you get used to them but they're not comfortable. Skill trees, levelling and crafting are confusing and unusable. The levels feel bland with little to no story pay-off and while the 'open sections' look non-linear, they aren't, try going off road and driving straight to your marker, you can't. The freedom is just an illusion that disappoints you when you find out, it's very unfulfilling, I'd rather not be tricked into thinking I can actually drive around open spaces. Because of this, the Nomad (new Mako) which has wheels as tall as a man can't climb hills with a 20 degree incline in order to discourage exploration of these faux-open spaces, it comes across as very disingenuine. 

People say if this game wasn't a ME game it wouldn't get such a bad rapport, but it IS a Mass Effect game and should be held to a high standard. If this game wasn't a Mass Effect game, it's so mundane people wouldn't even notice it. People also excuse Ryder's character because ""you cant have another Shepard"", which I agree with, but you could at least have someone with a personality. The original trilogy had an edge and personality to it, moral choices meant something, you actually had control of the character and game. But here it feels like you're more of a passenger, on a prison bus, in the middle of the desert.",1631602034,1633121107,False,2,0,0.46875,0,True,False,False

Slight minus due to glitches(only three requiring reloads!) as well as the task missions that don't really give waypoints and have random and/or chance spawns per visit to a world(Elaaden and Voeld being the main culprits of these missions). 
Also, you cannot 100% achievement this game without a controller, not a big deal, but annoying still.(35s airtime achievement)

The story works well enough, but the character development feels very rough or very forced at times. The romance segments don't particularly feel ""good"" - no real spark between the characters. I will admit the Suvi conversation had me laughing(mostly cringe, but it'll do). Just be careful, once a relationship between characters blossoms the rest(with an exception) get locked out and the payoff of said relationships are... nil. 
The ending of the game was anticlimactic. While there's a big segment devoted to it and it makes sense, it just felt like there should have been more(particularly due to a prior mission where [spoiler] Ryder will supposedly get the help from the archon's subordinate at an ""opportune"" time and doesn't.

Didn't touch multiplayer.

Overall: It's worth playing if you like the series, just don't expect to love the character interactions or the way the story ends(loose ends).

Just ignore all the negatives that were so hammered when it launched, play it for yourself. There are still bugs and quirks, but nothing really upsetting or that can't be solved with a reload to a few minutes earlier, or simply ignored.

Non skip on landing/departing planets with a crappy video and no interaction. for no reason, it's not used to cover up loading. it's just literally trash put on screen you can only skip with a mod.

Awful story-line:
Granted, the other story lines from previous games were also at an A+ shit level, sporting rather obvious plot you could see coming 3 miles out, bad voice acting etc.
Most of it in fact, is left unresolved / unknown.

Shit Animation work:
This game has the ""beauty"" of also sporting BAD animations.
That's right. Not only do they basically force you to watch some of this stuff, but it's also NOT properly animated.
From character's asses being 2 miles from their chest bone, to  puppet hands through-out.
This does extend to the facial animation too, which was supposed to be ""great"" - it's not.

Horrible mechanics overall:
Basically, every time you exit the ship you have to swap gear. can't swap on the fly. can't upgrade on the fly, can't install weapon mods on the fly. The crafting and research system is also horrible, though not as bad as some other AAA titles.
The rest is about what you'd expect from a 3rd person FPS.
The guns shoot. Head-shots aren't deadly.
Shit space exploration. Literally just a waste of your fucking time. Whoever made this knew it, and just didn't give a shit.

Also, for a ME game, Most of your game decisions didn't actually seem to have any impact on anything at all. And the ones that do sort of make no sense either.

The ""pros"", and why maybe 30 hours of a game-play could be worth it.

Environments are nice. even well made for the most part.
Somewhat interesting side activities that lead to exploring the map(s).
There's no big side story lines. just the same BS as the other ME games for companion side stuff.

If you happen to read reviews.
Don't buy it unless it's around $8. that's maybe what it's actually worth as a game.

The first Mass Effect hails from 2007, and the main issue I have with ME:A is that it seems to have been MADE in 2007. It feels overall clunky and ""heavy"", the UI is VERY 2007-ish (think polluted, too much info at the same time, etc.) and it was not aesthetically pleasing. I wish the UI transitions and overall usage were faster, but I'm picky with UIs so eh.

Main character animations are a big oof, depending on how you are running, if you make sharp turns with Ryder he/she will tilt their body at like 40 degrees and will seem like they're running on honey or some shit. Sometimes there's a big disaster happening and the Ryder twins just stand there with a dumbass smile on their face, with less expressions than Nic Cage. Other aliens animations are okay, I guess, I haven't seen those particular aliens IRL to judge.

Sound? The game has it and I'm okay with it. 

Controls? Overall they seem solid, aiming is good and shooting has decent feedback. Walking around is meh due to the issue I mentioned with the Ryder Twins not being to run correctly, probably due to being frozen for too long.

One HUGE issue I had with the game was the animations you had to see when going from planet A to planet B. Sure, you can skip them, but keep in mind you have a shit ton of planets to go there and blip into your thirst of discovery of everything (I mean, it has a freaking exclamation point, I HAVE to do this). IMHO this could be easily fixed by making the transitions between systems have a little bit more depth into them (per example looking more than just a tunnel of wind) and doing the planet-probing thing all via actual probes, without needing to go to the planet to then zoom on them and blablabla.

Overall? Very decent, for 2007. 

Would I play it again? Oh hell no. I actually finished it only because I had committed to it, because I really wanted to uninstall it.

Would I recommend? Yes if you're not at ALL picky with new games. No if you're SLIGHTLY picky. As the majority of people are, I have marked this as a no-no.",1632417007,1632417007,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. The gameplay is much faster than the original games with many weapon mods to tinker, you can even change your rifle fire type from burst mode to automatic with the right mod (the original trilogy don't allow you to do this). Cover system is automatic (don't need to press space) and your jet pack allows you to maneuver like never before in any Mass Effect game. Harvesting minerals actually helps you make your own custom weapons, armors (with your chosen augmentations) that are much more powerful than buying from a trader and upgrade your Nomad (your sweet ride) instead of doing almost nothing in previous games. Speaking of ride, driving Nomad is the best thing about this game. This actually makes you feel like you're exploring a new galaxy.
2. The story line leaves much to be desired and the characters are kinda bland. But then again, you're not Commander Shepard, but an inexperienced lad who doesn't know anything. You can't expect a young lad to be as charismatic and have leadership skills with awe-inspiring speeches like the Commander. The villain is somewhat lacking as well but then this Archon is not the Reapers, he's also a living being with a heart, though misplaced it might be. So, of course, he's not as threatening as the Reapers.

There are downsides (of course) and because I'm playing this in 2021, I'm spared by any bugs or glitches:
1. If there is anything I'd like to fix, it'd be making the landing sequences skippable, and I'm not alone in this at all. It takes a good chunk out of my playing time. I'd suggest you do all you can in one world before you take off, that'd prevent you from being pissed off from watching the same scenes over and over again during your time playing this game.
2. Please remove fetch quests. I think no triple A games should have fetch quests in them anymore. Even side quests in triple A games nowaday have to be fun and meaningful to play (you can blame the Witcher 3 for setting the bar for sidequests much higher now). These fetch quests (like scanning minerals or kett devices with no nav points, no less) are tedious and boring. Unless you're a good-for-nothing person with time to spare, no one would want to play them.
3. If there is one more thing to complain, I'd say it is the lack of more playable worlds. Five explorable worlds in an entire cluster? Not enough at all. All other worlds are just there for show and only some give you minerals and loots, and not by a lot either.

Overall, if you're looking for a game to kill your time during the pandemic after playing all the legendary games out there (the Witcher series, Gears of War, Mass Effect Legendary Edition, Halo,...), this is the next best option.

I'm so tired of going back to the same planets only so I can be sent to two additional planets before the cookie cutter fetch quest can be done. 

At first glance this game is great. The combat is decent, and the story for the most part is good. The companions story arcs are probably my favorite part. But I'm weighed down by the number of immersion breaking quests that completely make me loose sight of what it is in Andromeda I'm supposed to be doing. Skyrim suffered from this. The Witcher as well. I want to be able to finish a game and still hold onto the purpose of it all. But completion for a game means finishing all of these cookie cutter content scenes. Most of which fans of the previous mass effect will have experience with. Not at all worth my extended time, but necessary if I want to complete the game on Insanity mode as I am often wanting to do. 

Fix the companions. It feels like they are sitting ducks to be picked off one by one. 
Fix the powers. Soldier feels like they are penalized just for having certain skills that require power cells. Useless when you consider that biotic abilities scale similarly and cause as much damage. Just pitiful. 
Fix your squad power. Please for the love of God give us back control over which powers our companions use at which time. The power bar was a loved feature. Where did it go?
Fix your story. Mass Effect one-three were tied together by the threat of a reaper invasion. The stakes were just too high to ignore and everything we did tied into that story. Andromeda plays out like a murder on the orient express. You're kinda thrilled to figure it out, but replay value is next to zero unless I have no other games (I have lots of other games).

This is why it is not Mass Effect 4. It’s basically a spin off focused much more on exploration than story. Also, considering how the development of MEA was a total nightmare, the game is actually pretty good.

Story wise ME Andromeda feels like ME1. It starts off very slowly, like a hard sci-fi Star Trek episode instead of blockbuster space opera Star Wars movie. There is no central antagonist for much of the game. There’s the Kett, but the danger they impose is very secondary to the main plot of just establishing a safe haven for the Milky Way races in Andromeda, and the Scourge seems like an unnatural phenomenon, not an enemy. I do understand that being Star Trek instead of Star Wars can be very bland and boring to many players, especially after the epicness of ME2 and 3. However, quite honestly this is very refreshing, as having another unknowable ancient evil be the bad guy would be rather tiring. It just feels more grounded than the OT.

Ryder is not Shepard. They might be a bit too easy going for some gamers, as they are, in a way, similar to sarcastic Hawke from DA2, but they are their own people. Bioware did not try to create a Shepard clone, someone who already starts off with a reputation and is either decorated or feared. Ryder is a young, inexperienced rookie who needs to prove themselves they are worthy of the Pathfinder title. Male Ryder’s VO is rather bland, though. Have not tried the female one.

Exploration is similar to Dragon Age Inquisition. Except it’s not a total chore and is actually pretty fun; it also has that frontier vibe, with a sense of mystery and a bit of horror. Why?

- Maps are better planned
- Sprinting is fast and infinite
- High jump/double jump and dash mechanics for ease of traversal
- Nomad is better than the Mako and Hammerhead combined, unlike the horses which are slow and stop on every little rock in their way
- Fast travel points are aplenty
- There are much fewer collectibles and resources to manually pick up (though there are still plenty of containers to loot)
- There is no pickup animation (one of the few things that can be modded in DAI on PC BTW)
- Every collectible and resource is visible and recognizable from a distance, so no need to use a “scan” ability to mark them
- Mass Effect’s combat is much faster paced and more fluid than DAI’s which works much better in an open world setting

Overall it’s a huge step up from DAI.

Since the story is about finding a new home, the gameplay focuses on exploration. There are few linear shooting galleries like in ME2 and 3.
The combat is a great improvement over ME3, unlike in DAI, where the combat was very streamlined to make it more dynamic, even though in DAO it was designed to be more tactical like in e.g. Baldur's Gate. The combat can be borderline exhilarating at times. The jump jets/biotic jumps, being able to hover in air while shooting, very fast dodging. What's more, it relies more on the character's attributes than the player's skill, making it more of an RPG than ME2 and ME3 in that regard. The gameplay is much less a cover shooter and much more run n’ gun even at higher difficulties, at least post level 10. The character skills and equipment have much more impact on combat than player skill, unlike ME2 and 3. Hell, even the camera is much further back when exploring and feels like taken straight out of ME1.
MEA has adopted the dynamic class system from Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning e.g. Combat + Biotics = Vanguard, pure Combat = Soldier, pure Biotics = Adept. This is, again, a step forward by reintroducing the class system from ME1, and improving upon it.

Graphically still looks fantastic. Travelling from planet to planet is pure eye candy.

Squadmates:
The Loyalty Missions are endings of large quest lines involving specific teammates. They are all some of the best content in MEA and reach the quality of ME2 loyalty missions. In my opinion Cora’s and Drack’s are the best ones.

- Cora starts off annoying, but grows on you, as her character develops over time. Arguably the only squadmate with development.
- Drack is an old, experienced krogan. Arguably the best one with his dialogue and scenes. Enjoyable, has good banter with everyone. 
- Vetra is not, as some people erroneously claim, a female Garrus. She is nothing like him, but still, arguably, the most relatable.
- Liam starts off as Jacob 2.0 i.e. really poorly, but gets into this buddy comedy shtick with Jaal, which works surprisingly well.
- Jaal is a fish out of water type of character and, as mentioned above, works off Liam well.
- Peebee is not Sera. Just acts a bit goofy, but she's actually more like Lara Croft or Indiana Jones: an archeologist-adventurer. 

In general it’s a team of young people (including Ryder, excluding Drack) exploring a new galaxy. If you approach it like that your perception of the team might change for the better.

What I did not like:
- Character creation is surprisingly limited. Hate the fact that eyes, eyebrows, lips are connected to specific skin complexions and you cannot just choose from a set of either to mix and match.
- SAM is very boring and incredibly f*cking annoying. It reminds you about temperature change every. Single. Godd*mn. Time. At some point I expected SAM to tell me to breathe in order not to die. Thank god for mods that remove these pointless reminders.
- Remnant Vaults become chores very fast. Puzzles are annoying.
- Bug-wise, sometimes enemies spawn inside the ground or walls. Mildly annoying, but my progress was never blocked because of this issue.

Music needs a completely separate section. There’s barely any of it that’s audible. You have music in the main menu (A Better Beginning), on the Galaxy Map (Heleus), during combat... and that's basically it. What the hell. While exploring the planets you have this faint, barely noticeable, ambient music in the background, which is completely drown out by literally any other sound in the game. Running around hubs and your ship is completely devoid of any music. 
The biggest issue I have with it, is that if you listen to the soundtrack outside of the game, it has some fantastic tunes. It’s Bioware’s new direction of subduing music and making the environmental sounds speak for themselves… except this simply does not work. It did not work in DAI, it does not work here. It makes the game seem empty and lifeless and wastes a perfectly fine soundtrack. It is literally musical wallpaper: it’s there in the background, but you almost never notice it.
There is one track, A Trail of Hope, that’s pretty good and could be the main theme, but it’s only in the game ONCE. There are no callbacks throughout the game at all. Callbacks are extremely important to establish a piece of music as the main theme of the game.
Another one I mentioned before, A Better Beginning, is arguably the best track in the game, but it’s erroneously shoved into the main menu. It is a slow buildup type of track: it takes around 2 and a half minutes to get to the epic part. How much time does a player spend in the main menu? 10-20 second tops? A shorter version should have been put into the main menu, with the full version in the credits and/or the OST. You do not have to look far for a perfect example: ME1 and Vigil. Vigil instantly grabs your attention and is around 1 and a half minute long.

My overall point is, despite its jankiness, there is a lot to love here. The writing can be iffy at times, and can remind you the best bits from the OT at times. The last mission is sufficiently epic, the epilogue is sweet, and the potential for a sequel, which will most likely never happen, tremendous. In short, you need to try it for yourself.",1631909329,1631909428,True,3,1,0.548151552677154541,0,True,False,False

The story is uninteresting and the dialogue is often cringe inducing, with characters acting more like the fantasies of a teenager than believable people. This is a noticeable decline compared to the quality of the original mass effect trilogy. 

The combat itself is a sidegrade, there are some improvements such as greater open world elements and more customisation options, but these are balanced out by the new, vastly worse, cover system and some very questionable encounter balancing. To have any chance in the combat at the game you have to be in cover, which was never a problem in the previous games but here, in an open world setting it becomes painful. Enemies will spawn in or wander into aggro range from any direction, and kill you almost before you have time to react. 

The facial animations are no longer the joke that they were on the game's launch, but there is still something off about the main character's face, which makes it very hard to take any of the emotional moments in the game seriously. This makes it even harder to get involved with the story. 

Perhaps the biggest flaw with the game, however, is the time it takes to do anything. Every single menu feels like it requires double the number of clicks than it should. Moving between systems and planets is also painfully slow. While you can skip part of the animation, there is still an excruciatingly long time spent watching planets zoom in and out.

So.... Off the bat, I'll throw in the two things that holds this game back from being amazing:

First are the bugs.  This game has so many pop ins, glitches, clipping issues, weird ass animations, etc. etc., you name it, its got it.  I had to restart my game or reload previous saves like 10 times because of various buggy reasons.
The second thing....is that the OG Mass Effect trilogy has raised the bar SO INSANELY HIGH, that it honestly makes this game look a little bad.

And that's all I got on negatives.  Andromeda knocks it out of the park with its gameplay and visuals.  The narrative plays out in a sort of coming-of-age fashion too, which we haven't really seen before.  You take on Ryder, a young pioneer who is suddenly thrown into a position of leadership and quickly has to learn the ropes of what it means to be a Pathfinder in a new galaxy.  He/she isn't Shepard, and doesn't pretend to be Shepard.  And that's not a bad thing.  ME is all about character development, and Andromeda doesn't disappoint in the slightest.

I mean, there were other issues when it got released, obviously (I had bugs and extremely bad animations, that forced me to refund), but at this point in time - inconsistencies.
They are mostly small ones like doors, map navpoints (and sometimes map markers), action prompts, scanner points, ""homing"" abilities and bullets... But there are more major ones as well. Even in lore and story: some things are explained relatively well, but others are ""just there"", or made as if they were designed by people having no technical knowledge or ability to view things ""practically"" (I am looking at you, galaxy map). Even the characters are inconsistent. The most consistent one is Pebee, but that's because she is meant to be somewhat chaotic. And for some reason the game decided, that I am romancing Cora and not her, because Cora's loyalty mission became available (and completed) sooner.
Ryder is also extremely inconsistent. I am used to choices saying not what the character will be saying when you choose them (this was the case in previous ME games as well), but here some replies felt so out of place and out of character. Or rather, it felt as if Ryder does not have a character at all. Maybe I am misremembering, but original trilogy still provided a more fleshed-out Shepard no matter the combination of choices you took. Perhaps it was because of a more simplified ""Paragon"" system, since he was either more brutal or more peace-loving, but still.
Does this make this game bad? No. But it does take a lot from it being good. While playing it, I was thinking of original ME: let's be honest, it also was a bit unpolished and rough on the edges. But it had a pretty good narrative for the time, thus it was a success. And then ME2 and ME3 raised the bar for quality even higher despite some questionable things there as well. And with Andromeda we expected same quality.
Sadly, it is roughly like ME1, but with narrative, that is slightly worse because of those inconsistences. Having planets, that you help to inhabit is an amazing thing, it can create an open world worth exploring, but the way it's presented does not fit the circumstances. It's simply not practical. Hvarl felt the most consistent in that regard: it was small and to the point. The way it would be, when you come to an unknown world. Long-distance travel (by ship or by car) when you have limited resources - just a dream and a waste, unless there is something to actually gain from the travel. But on the other hand - doing something for the communities in order to increase ""viability"" - that's logical.
And the scale overall becomes the problem in the end. When we are doing the final mission, we are shown a large construct, that should cause awe, but since we already seen similar structures, but just a bit smaller - the awe is not there. Because we are used to this scale. Since we've seen it from the very start.
But still, I would recommend it. It's not a bad a game. I did enjoy doing the quests, even though I've skipped quite a few dialogues during side-quests. They were ok, but simply did not have enough ""character"". Again, because of the scale, which was ill-fitted most of the time. If only they had more time to polish it.

- The characters or companions is actually great. But kinda lack the goofiness of comedic value in the interaction.
- TONS of sidequests and tasks. I MEAN IT. You will spend a lot of your time in here.
- I don't like how we interact with the resource (need visual cue to show that the resource is depleted)

I finished the original trilogy for the first time in 2021 and immediately started playing this afterwards. I finally finished every side quest and main mission. In the first 20 minutes, I wasn't sure. Ryder was just an inexperienced lost kid compared to Commander Shepard. But I think it had to be this way - you couldn't have another Commander Shepard. Ryder had to find their own path. 

Everyone who worked on this game should be incredibly proud of their work. It is a HUGE game! In mass effect 2, you compile your team, complete their loyalty missions and finish the game. In this game, not only does everyone have loyalty missions, but you're also building planets and have a main story quest. There is a ton of extra dialogue with extra NPCs that just add to the story lore. It seems like the size of ME2+3 combined.

I loved the original trilogy and I loved this game as well. Highly recommend re-visiting this if you completed the trilogy. I still came across a couple of bugs, but I think they fixed most things from when it was originally released in 2017.
I would love a sequel to this game. There is a lot more to uncover about the kett, the angara, the other arcs, and the origin of the initiative.

Now for the review:
5,5/10. 
Has its moments, but falls short most of the time. I still recommend it, but only if you buy it during a sale and avoid doing the ""Additional tasks"" quests. 

The good:
- Some decent characters, especially Jaal. 
- The protagonist has his/her own distinct personality. They didn't try to lazily copy Shepard. 
- Voice acting is better than previous installments, especially in tense situations. 

The bad:
- For a game centered around exploration there aren't that many wonders to behold. I mean, the wildlife on all the planets you explore are just the same four creatures with slightly different skins... Also, that giant robot-Thresher Maw thing and that ""Architect""? Should've had more of that and less random dropships of enemies landing every 100 meters. 

- Most missions apart from the ones assigned by your allies are repetitive or have poor writing. And the ones related to the remnant are probably the worst.

- If you didn't figure it out from the beginning of the review: This game has some bugs. Apart from the one mentioned above, it's nothing gamebreaking, but it's definitely annoying. Loading saves often fixes these issues. 

- Making the game open world was a bad decision. If you don't intend to add as much depth and details to an open world game like Skyrim or Fallout, it's better to use the old Mass effect recipe. 

- Also, the antagonists of the game are boring.

I played immediately after legendary edition 1/2/3, and I can say absolutely this game does NOT compare as a Mass Effect game. If you go in wanting Mass Effect, you WILL be let down. 

However, this stands up well as a game of its own. Learning the controls and differences in game handling immediately after the others was confusing and frustrating at the beginning, however once you learn and got used to it, it was fine. Jump-jets ended up making navigating terrain pretty enjoyable! I did not encounter any game-altering/breaking bugs or glitches nor anything that affected gameplay negatively.

Almost no choice you make in game matters. Whether or not it will in a some-day sequel, who knows, but at this point almost every single decision is based solely on what you as a human would do, and has no bearing on anything at all. People won't die from your choices, events won't dramatically change. It's just A or B for the sake of A or B.

No probing planets like in the original trilogy, but there is a LOT of backtracking from planets as there are only about five or six main ones you visit. You cannot skip the cutscenes between galaxies, so if you gotta do a lot of galaxy-hopping, have a phone or a show nearby to save yourself from boredom.

The crew is nowhere near as beloved but they eventually get some character and grow on you a bit. There is a cute ongoing questline throughout the game where Liam is hosting a movie night, and it gets more and more excessive the longer it gets pushed off (due to crappy things happening in-world that made partying seem inappropriate). Romance is sorely lacking. My Ryder was a flirt and I did every romance option I could. I ended up sleeping with Liam, one-night-stand with Peebee, a full romance with Reyes on Kadara and a romantic head-touch with Jaal. I got no final romantic cutscene or any real dialogue throughout the game that made it seem like a romance option was chatting me up. A big disappointment comparatively to Garrus.

The Nomad (Mako equivilent) is very fun to drive! I love how it handles. You can buy upgrades and change color and design. Loved it!

LOVE the level up system! Even better than 1/2/3. You can choose between Combat, Biotics and Tech, put points into anything you would like, and you can have three abilities active at a time. They can be any combination of the combat types. You get plenty of points so you can switch mid-game if desired. I started Combat and then went almost full Tech. You can change your specialization (soldier, adept, etc) on the fly as well at any time, and there are specialist bonuses for each one. Love it!

Almost every character is bland or unattractive, as is widely known. Thought I was making a pretty attractive Ryder and was sorely let down when gameplay started. Alien races are all... strange looking. Turians are exclusively white for the most part, and many voices of all races are very human and off-sounding. There is not a lot of animation to character models and a lot of non-major characters are rather static when speaking to you. Kesh the krogan has always been off to me, both model and voice. Salarian Director Tann just sounds human.

Remnant puzzles which you encounter throughout the game have a sudoku-like puzzle you must solve before progressing. I myself enjoyed these, however I see how MANY would not. Luckily you can buy a glyph in-game for very cheap from stores which allows you to bypass these.

Again, this does not stand up as a Mass Effect game. There is little to do with other races, and the ones we do encounter and work with just seem wrong for some reason. The animation of the game is different, and it is a jarring difference to at least me. It is little more than exploring planets (six or so main planets) and doing quests throughout them. Little is about the 'people'. There are MANY things throughout the game which would have been great to be improved upon/changed/bettered, don't get me wrong, there are MANY. But as its own game, I enjoyed it a lot and found myself wanting to play everyday.

don't get this game expecting a deep story with meaningfull dialogue options. 
the story is dull, really forgettable and full of plot holes. your choices don't matter and there aren't a lot of likeable characters you interact with. half of your crew are a**holes and if you haven't seen the memes yet you should definitely look at those first (even though as far as I can tell most of the bugs seem fixed, I only encountered 2 crashes so far).
the combat is a huge improvement over the older games. running around and using your abilities seems way more fluent since it doesn't stop time and the skill system that allows you to freely spend points in whatever ability and passive you like gives you tons of options for playthroughs. 
My favourite, and something that you weren't able to do in the older games, is playing a sniper build that uses singularity and lance for biotic combos and backlash as a defensive option to bounce back bullets at the attacker. 
another big plus is the weapon crafting system that allows you to make your own weapons and add mods to them. I found that using a sniper rifle like the black widow in combination with the equalizer smg works really well since this smg doesn't run out of ammo, kinda like in mass effect 1, and you can use a mod with it that changes its shots to heat-seeking plasma bolts so you can spray from cover without aiming much, or just while hovering in the air.

[hr][/hr] 

So, regarding the game (don't worry, no spoilers):

With the patches and the mods, the game is actually pretty solid and definitely what you expect from Mass Effect. Some animations are still a little janky, but that doesn't take away from the whole experience. 

The combat is a lot of fun. You can modify every weapon in interesting ways. For example, there are mods to make every weapon a grenade launcher - even shotguns or snipers. Trouble aiming? Make every projectile homing. Want more ratatata? You can turn every weapon full-auto if you feel like it. No exceptions. You like beam weapons? Every weapon can become one. With the addition of the jump jet and hover mechanic which don't even need any upgrade points to use, it is quite fluent and even somewhat ""Doom-like"". The skills are also well done, with the possibility to add multiple loadouts and switch between them during the fight. At the end, depending on your loadout choices, you can become a death machine, which actually reminded me of Risk of Rain with its crazy power curve.

The story is interesting too and has exciting moments. Of course, it has its plotholes if you think too much about it, but so does every Mass Effect game - I guess that comes with the scifi genre. The characters and crew you meet are all pretty great. The interactions/talks/banter between them are probably the best of the series so far - still wish they would push this aspect even further, though. This is what makes Mass Effect games great to me.

However, the main problem of the game is that it's too long. It took me around 85 hours to 100% it - meanwhile, the Legendary Edition with Mass Effect 1 to 3 took me around 110 hours. That's a huge difference, and shows the lack of focus. Especially at the 50% mark you might feel overwhelmed with the quests the game gives you. Most of those quests are going to be collect/fetch quests, where you go to one place, find something, then go to the next one, sometimes even over multiple planets. That takes a lot of time and is just unnecessary. The game would have been better simply by just removing them. Doesn't help that there are animations for a lot of things, like flying to another star system or planet. It looks nice the first few times, but just becomes a chore at later moments of the game. The quests that aren't merely fetch quests are great though and creative, and have all the cutscenes you would want.

The planets look nice and the skys are lovely. Driving around is also surprisingly fun, at least if you get all the upgrades for your vehicle, which isn't too far into the game. It's not a chore like in Mass Effect 1, and you have fast travel points all over the map.

The UI could also be improved. Inventories are  mostly long lists, but it's less of a problem on the PC, since you can use the mouse and scroll bars.

[b]Should you get it?[/b]

If you want to see what happens in the Mass Effect universe in another galaxy with all the different species, yes. If you don't like open-world or semi-open-world games or don't have the time to spare, no. If you didn't play any Mass Effect games before, probably not. Play the Legendary Edition first. If you enjoyed Mass Effect 1 and the side quests and planets didn't bother you too much, you might also enjoy Andromeda.

I blame EA for giving this game the green light and releasing it too early, thus resulting in a lot of negative backslash and subsequently a drop in sales.

Often the characters feel flat and unlikable, and while I loved the original Mass Effect lore, the space magic-technology makes it feel like there's not really that much at stake, despite the concept of the main plot.

At first I was frustrated by the shift in the gameplay mechanics from the original trilogy, but it grew to be fairly fun. Though, once you find a particular character build, the variety of fights stays basically the same and so there's never really much incentive to change things up. Didn't care much for the main bad-guys, but I do want to know more about the history of the galaxy.

As a spin-off and a fun space rpg, yeah, I'd recommend it. There's definitely a lot of effort put into a lot of the production, and that effort definitely made it fun - but it just doesn't feel like Mass Effect where you'd be talking about it with your friends for years to come.

So much angst. Before ME Andromeda came on the scene, I was barely aware of an online cohort of gamers so invested in a franchise. Really, it's been a tremendously educational cultural experience. Perhaps that will be ME Andromeda's legacy: the power of an online community to give life to a triple A game, or kill it (not that ME Andromeda actually was extinguished, but the hopes of its developers and publishers surely must have been curtailed).

Of course, I'd played the original Mass Effect trilogy - twice, in fact. No doubt at all that it was one of the most compelling gaming experiences I've ever had. Garrus, Liara, Mordin, Tali, Samara and more - wonderful, wonderful characters to spend time with. And the Mass Effect universe, with all its alien races, the wonder of the Citadel (with humans in a distinctly junior role), and the horror of the Reapers - high concept SF bliss. 

How does ME Andromeda compare? That's the fundamental question, because the original trilogy set the bar so high, and ME Andromeda, for good or ill, was placed in the unenviable position of successor - probably something of a losing proposition from the start.

I've now completed two play-throughs of ME Andromeda, which says something in itself about the basic quality of the game. I initially purchased it on Origin a year or more after it was released, so I was spared many of the initial problems that generated so much internet heat. My second play-through (on the current version available on Steam) was completed on an upper mid-range set up: i7 9700k, GTX1080, 16 GB RAM, running at 1440p, everything maxed out except the lighting, shadow quality, and ambient occlusion (all about one notch down from maximum).

For anyone who's played the original trilogy, it's almost impossible to take ME Andromeda on its own terms and, surely, the devs and publishers hoped to capitalise on the nostalgia and affection of the original fans. I think ME Andromeda is a very solid game. If the original trilogy is a 10/10, then ME Andromeda is probably around a 7.5-8. Had the original trilogy never existed, I suspect ME Andromeda's reception would have been kinder (original release bugs notwithstanding).

But the original trilogy does exist, and ME Andromeda was pitched as a sequel - so, in my view, it's entirely reasonable to judge the game in this light. How does it stack up in 2021?

ME Andromeda is a pretty slick, polished game. Visually it's beautiful, with some fantastic art design, and definitely an advance over the earlier games. Are the facial animations a bit dodgy? Maybe - I've seen better and I've seen worse. ME Andromeda is probably not Witcher 3 level, but honestly, I don't feel qualified to judge.

Whilst I missed the degree of control I had over squad members in the original trilogy, I'd tend to agree with most reviewers that ME Andromeda's combat is an advance - especially the jet pack, which eliminates the clumsy mechanic of clambering over obstacles in the earlier games.

ME Andromeda presents some compelling characters and presents a suitably epic space opera. Again, if the original trilogy had never existed, certain limitations of ME Andromeda's characters and story might well have gone unexamined. However, as it stands, we have no Garrus (although I did like Vetra). We have no Liara (although I really liked Lexi and wished she could have had a greater role in the game). Jaal is a bit stuffy and boring. Peebee is a juvenile annoyance. The Asari are all clones, which is a bit disappointing. Is this all a bit subjective? Of course (but still, Garrus and Liara are hard acts to follow).

ME Andromeda is a generous game. My last play-through clocked in at 116 hours. There are positives and negatives to this. The game does have quite a lot of padding - but, to be fair, this also is a feature of the original trilogy. Nevertheless, I can't help thinking that trimming the game back to the 60 or so hours that each of the original three games took to complete would make for a better game-play experience - especially as this would likely involve dumping many of the dull fetch quests. At the completion of my last play-through, most of the 'Additional Tasks' remained uncompleted, because, you know, life's too short.

Bugs? They still exist and are unlikely ever to be fixed. The bugs aren't game-breaking, but they certainly up the frustration level of ME Andromeda - all the more given the good behaviour of the original trilogy. I admit I was using mods on my second play-through, so complaints in this area may not be entirely fair. Nevertheless, online testimony seems to suggest that, even unmodded, I'd still have some problems. I encountered two main issues:

(i) loading a game saved whilst driving the Nomad  would take several minutes. Solution: don't save (or die) inside the Nomad.

(ii) the game had a tendency to freeze during planetary landing cut scenes in the Tempest. Landing on Havarl, Aya, and Kadara seemed to create the most problems. Maybe just my set-up; I don't know.

It's still a tribute to the overall quality of ME Andromeda that I persevered with these issues. Certainly, the crashing was much less of a pain than, say, Fallout NV - modded or not!

The final verdict? ME Andromeda is something of a Cinderella, but certainly a compelling, enjoyable, and worthwhile way to pour 100 hours or so of your life essence down the plug-hole of gaming - especially at the very reasonable prices it is now presented.",1630668565,1630668565,True,18,0,0.60773468017578125,0,True,False,False

	Some glitches prevented me from finishing missions and the facial animations are still extremely off-putting, even after modding the game to all hell it still felt unappealing. The story felt bland, and the MacGuffin failed to drive me through the story.

It follows the same format as previous ME games. A scripted interactive movie that injects annoying cut scenes and guarantees the story flows in a manor of Hollywood stupidity. The story is good, but choices are simply an illusion. Oh look, the bad guy stole our.., or gee a cut scene and the antagonist escapes. That sort of thing. Does not make for good game play.

AI is slightly better than other ME games. Squad mates do help sometimes, and at others stand around while you are sprayed with heavy weapons and fired on by all opponents. The enemy AI still tends to focus on the player, no mater what the squad mates are doing.

[b][u]STORY: (4/5)[/u][/b]
Mass Effect: Andromeda is about the Ryder Twins and a group of people spanning multiple species that leave the Milky Way Galaxy for the Andromeda Galaxy between the events of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 and what happens to them 634 years later. Overall, the story is really not that bad. Truly, it is the highlight of the game. The characters are mostly well developed and have their own motivations, wants, and desires. The problem is the way it is presented and negative impact the gameplay has on it.

[b][u]GAMEPLAY: (1/5)[/u][/b]
You're probably thinking i'm crazy giving the gameplay a 1 out of 5, but hear me out. It's true that the combat is pretty decent. But, that is the only good thing I can say about the gameplay. The rest of the game suffers from horrible game design. The open world busywork was mind numbing, boring, and was so prevalent it dragged down the entire game. Once you get to a planet literally everything comes to a complete halt while a billion meaningless and tedious side quests open up across the whole map. I almost quit several times, but forced myself through once so I could say I've played the whole thing and seen everything that this game has to offer. The entire game has the feeling it was designed to waste your time so sites like ""How Long to Beat"" can report a higher count. I do not like it at all and I'm usually a fan of open world design as long as it's done right. This is the same problem Dragon Age Inquisition suffered from magnified by a factor of 100.

[b][u]SOUNDS: (3/5)[/u][/b]
Had some audio glitching happen during certain stages of the game. Mostly on the Asari Ark where sound would cut in and out at times and during some Vaults. Otherwise, the sound was fine the rest of the game. I liked the music and thought it fit the sequences it was paired with well.

[b][u]GRAPHICS: (4/5)[/u][/b]
For the most part this game looks great. I did like the atmosphere of the locations. However, I had some graphical glitches involving animations in some places, but nothing super major that broke the game. I experienced no major FPS drops using a 30 series GPU like I seen some people mention online. Felt smooth as butter.

[b][u]REPLAY VALUE: (2/5)[/u][/b]
It does have some replay value, but I can't bring myself to play this game again due to the design decisions in this game. It physically pains me thinking about it. If I ever did try it again I would probably skip every side quest that wasn't tied directly to one of the major NPCs on the Tempest.

[b][u]DO I RECOMMEND?:[/u][/b]
This was a tough decision because while the story is actually decent, the way the game was designed it became a chore to play and was simply no fun. I bought this game on sale for $7.50 and while I may have technically got my monies worth, the game simply isn't fun due to the way the game is designed. I really hope going forward with the Mass Effect franchise they reconsider the Open World design and go back to how the Original Trilogy was structured. Focus on delivering the story without burdening the player with obnoxious busywork designed to pad the game play time.",1630357158,1630359926,False,92,2,0.701680541038513184,1,True,False,False

The shift from war to exploration is nice. There is a new enemy and a new ""precursor race"", both of which open interesting mysteries. The game delivers that same feeling from ME 3 where everyone you allied with and help throughout the story comes to help you and give you that feeling of togetherness. 

All in all, ME Andromeda is an excellent introduction to a new story in the ME universe.

... and that is exactly the problem ... this is a game that introduces us to a new galaxy with a new story, and then abandoned it. So if anything, anyone buying this game should know that they are buying into a story that sets up a DLC and a sequel, knowing that there won't be a DLC and a sequel. 

The game sets up the path to a DLC containing the Quarian ark (responsible for bringing not only the quarians but the other milky way races such as elcor, drell, batarians, etc.) ... but that DLC was never released and we were already told that it will never be ... 

The game ends in a way similar to ME 1 with a ""this is only the first battle, the war starts now"" kind of cliff hanger ... and then you'll be left hanging on that cliff forever as the ME Andromeda universe gets abandoned and sequel plans for it are discarded. 

So, playing through ME Andromeda is like committing to watch the first season of a great series, knowing it got cancelled before the second season ever had a chance to pick up where it left off. 

That being said, in a world where we could still hope for the DLCs and sequels to happen, this would be a great game and great intro to a new take on the ME franchise.",1630326526,1630326526,True,0,0,0.481283396482467651,0,True,False,False

[u] To the Review: [/u]

This game kinda sucks. But it's also a Mass Effect game, so it has to be evaluated in that context as well: as a Mass Effect game, it also sucks. It's also a big disappointment in remembrance of the original games.

I had to force-feed myself the rest of this game when I was already full and nauseous from the first 20 hours. The story, the lines, the characters, the graphics glitches, the gameplay glitches -- terrible. A waste of my time. You honestly couldn't pay me to play through this again. The only reason I completed it was because I had spent money on it and started the game, so I wasn't going to leave it unfinished and let the money go to waste. I felt like I had to justify my purchase by at least seeing the game through to completion for myself.

Two positive things, amidst this poop storm of death and despair:
[olist]
[*]The graphics, when they aren't glitched, can actually look pretty good. Lighting, textures, and geometry are high quality. Praise the ill-begotten Frostbite engine and the poor game makers who probably had guns against their heads by EA...

[*]The controls/gameplay is good (definitely easier than the old days of configuring keyboard mappings onto a controller with Mass Effect 2, but that game is so much better that I'd friggin do it all over again -- twice -- before I'd even think about playing this game). If this game wasn't plagued by purposeless quests, if the game instead had a good story, interesting characters, etc. the gameplay is good enough where it would have contributed in a positive way. It's not good enough to carry the game though. I dislike the loot system, the enemies are a little dumb, but it can be fun to jump and dash around and shoot at things. The added mobility is a new thing for Mass Effect, and I like it. I guess it's not kosher for the Mass Effect series, but I also don't know if I'm the type of person to care enough about orthodoxy like that. The drivable vehicle is also superior in control and physical behavior to the one from Mass Effect 1, but again, I would tolerate the worse vehicle for some nice armor in a game like ME1 (especially when I take advantage of a little trick where I go into game files and make it so that I can speed up the game 10x at the press of the button: makes the Mako much more tolerable).
[/olist]

just look up the romances on YouTube...

But I absolutely hate being limited to only 3 active abilities -- especially with so many new options and skills now. It's as if they developers encourage multiple playthroughs with different classes, but trust me - you don't want to.

What got perhaps the most notoriety at the game's original launch was the very poor dialogue and uninteresting characters. I do appreciate that there's just so much detail and a lot going on throughout the game. But... it bombards you with it. And it's all just... boring after boring. Why do I care about this person? It's just uninteresting. Back at original release, and again after craving more Mass Effect after playing the new ME:Legendary edition, I tried repeatedly to get really into ME:A. But I can't. The characters are so boring. The dialogue is bad and dare I say cringy at times. I don't feel like I had real personality that I wanted from my dialogue choices.

Best looking ME game in terms of graphics, yes. However, the ME: Legendary somehow feels better when it comes to seeing the character's facial animations. ME:A's tends to draw you out of the game/immersion. That and why does every Asari look the same?

I quickly began to ignore all the side quests. Again bombarded with more boring characters filled to the brim with boring dialogue. Where's the excitement of adventure in a new galaxy? It's just not there. This game is plagued with the ""open world"" mantra of massive (albeit beautiful) maps to explore that is filled to the brim with tedious things to do that aren't of real consequence or at least interesting to play. In the OG trilogy I loved every opportunity to do every side quest I could find as it gave me interesting lore, a funny story, or expanded upon characters or items within the ME world. ME:A doesn't have that. Instead, these side quests are simple fetch quests, have you drive back and forth on these large maps, or give you details on a character you have no vested interest in; a faceless character.

The only interesting thing found in ME:A for me was the Remnant and the Scourge. The Kett were boring, but you can easily find yourself hating what they are and do (even if it's one-dimensional evil). The Remnant however seem unbelievably powerful, but are all but missing. It begs you to want to know more. But, we'll likely never know. EA abandoned the planned trilogy after the very poor reception of ME:A's original launch. A pity. Perhaps the 2nd Andromeda game would've been better. Maybe.

TLDR - If I could leave a mixed review, I would. I can only compel myself to recommend ME:A with the strong caveat that you limit your expectations coming into this game and separate the original ME trilogy. Take it for what it is and hope for some interesting connections when Mass Effect 4 comes out.",1630237182,1630237612,True,1,0,0.502074718475341797,0,True,False,False

Other than that and some minor stuff that's just annoying more than anything else it's a solid game. Don't know why it gets so much shit. There is more content in this one than any of the other ME games and the story is actually quite good. The amount of weapons and how you can mod them is pretty crazy and you got A LOT of skills to choose from for you character. Might be worth replaying just to try different builds. Characters can't really compare to the original trilogy but they are still better than 90% of the other RPG's characters out there and the main character is pretty cool as well. I was super biased when I went into the game since everyone was shitting on it and I am a huge fan of the original trilogy but my first playthrough took me 100+ hours to complete everything on 100% and I gotta say the game is good. It's really good It's definitely up to Mass Effect Standards. At the end of the Main Storyline you actually feel like you accomplished something and it feels like you're an actual hero. I did see some glitches here and there like some enemies stuck in walls and one minor side quest was bugged so it took twice as long to complete.

The Kett were just an organic, half-hearted rehash of Reapers. Seriously, I couldn't roll my eyes hard enough at how uninspired they were. You don't really get to know anything about the Remnant like you did the Protheans. I realize that Heleus is just a small portion of the Andromeda galaxy (no mass relays), but it felt dull and lifeless compared to the Milky Way, which was teeming with life. The Angara were kinda cool, but not that interesting.

It was unpolished, the devs were rushed and crunched by EA to oblivion, and some glitches were just too much to enjoy. There's a whole thing where an less experienced/ smaller team was tasked with big parts of the project but I'm not gonna be the best to retell that. But now that its years later and all the edges are smoothed out a bit, I'd argue it's in its best form now, I bought it a couple months ago on sale to see what it was about so I have no previous experience playing the game and I've played all the other mass effects: so what did I think?

[h1] Combat: [/h1] Andromeda when you play it does not feel like a Mass effect game, strange to say but anyone who has played it knows what I mean. In the original games your options were limited to find cover and shoot and use the appropriate weapons and abilities when necessary, and sure mass effect 3 went a step beyond with rolling but most of the games can be categorized in the same style of play. Andromeda goes far beyond that premise, including verticality in levels, fast movement, jump packs that can move you in any direction, and other means of traversing the area. while a big part of firefights is still about peaking from cover you feel much less rooted in one spot and are encouraged to stay on your toes. The biggest change however is the pathfinder system of character class, I was extremely against the idea of switching from soldier to engineer to vanguard etc. because to me that felt a bit like it didn't follow how people worked in this universe, a character was an infiltrator because they trained in covert ops or someone was a biotic because they were naturally gifted in such abilities, having people that could do any and all of that just seemed a bit unrealistic (but then again this is a sci-fi game about alien civilizations and space magic so what do I know). When I was able to look past that and start experimenting, the system was extremely fun, there's nothing quite like sneaking in as an infiltrator and sneaking a couple sniper headshots in before hunkering down with a soldier build to play king of the hill with the objective or charging in as a vanguard and tossing enemies around like they were part of the gmod physics engine, the options not only give a satisfying variety that keep combat from getting repetitive but also help you adapt to any situation. The new formatting also changes up how you play, for instance in the original trilogy I felt naked without a vindicator battle rifle, but in this game I think I touched an assault rifle maybe once, but I pretty much used every gun besides them. It changes up how you think about encounters and has enough options to suit a playstyle. On the downside the guns in this game don't have the same punch and grit as they did in old games and the enemy AI isn't the smartest but lets face it: this is mass effect, the bar for that wasn't that high to begin with. Overall the combat is refreshing and while I miss some parts I enjoy the new additions as well. [h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]

[h1] Non-Combat Gameplay [/h1] For this game Bioware brought back the vehicle planet traversing from mass effect 1, for me personally it was a mixed bag. I enjoyed exploring big maps and discovering things but sometimes getting from point A to point B felt like such a chore due to markers not being an exact science and the fact that the hill youre trying to go up is just a biiiit too steep for your climbing treads. The quests ranged from very interesting with some even nodding to the original trilogy to the most tedious and not-worth-it quests I've ever seen in a game. This game has probably over 2 dozen fetch quests where you have to find multiple things around a map, cause everyone loves fetch quests right? The vaults were a curious addition with most including puzzles that the player had to solve, some I felt proud of myself for figuting them out while others I was just happy they were over, though I will admit once you finally bring a planet to full vitality its very satisfying to see the world change as a result of your work. The personality responses replacing the paragon/renegade system is...different, I know there was talk of replacing it for years but I don't feel like this is what players had in mind; for better or for worse your demeanor no longer affects big decisions in the game and instead of gaining influence as ""yuor angel or youre debil >:)"" your nurse sends you an email that basically says ""hey your character has a stick up his ass, here's a lollipop"" (I played logical yet casual with my Ryder). Aside from those big things the UI could use some touching up but I like all the options for weapons. I'm don't dislike the gameplay outside of combat but I'm not exactly thrilled with it either, some things work, some don't, c'est la vie. [h1] 5.0/10 [/h1]

[h1] Story and Characters [/h1] That plot sure did happen, wish I coulda been a part of it. The main story admittedly feels very loosely put together with not a whole lot of forward direction, and it doesn't help that Ryder doesn't quite feel like a driving force and instead is just kinda along for the ride. If you compared how you started the game to how it ended you'd wonder how the h*ll did we end up doing this? And if you know the answer, please tell me cause I'm still not sure I just wanted to scan plants ;-;. The antagonists in the form of Archon and the Kett aren't really impactful to the player like say the geth or the collectors (at least in my personal experience), they serve their purpose but for the next game I would recommend either a new threat or pumping some life into the current one. Meanwhile the Angara are interesting additions to the mass effect universe, they have a fascinating history and culture but they don't quite mingle with the rest of the species of the game, but maybe that's just because they're so new. The big decisions in the game are alright but its hard to judge them without a sequel to reference how much they changed the world so we'll see how that goes. Now the real meat and potatoes comes in the form of your motley crew, the people of the tempest are the most emotionally engaging parts of the whole game. Every character on board from your squadmates to the people that keep the ship running go miles ahead of the previous games in terms of interacting with the player and each other. Its nice to go up to someone and they genuinely have something to say instead of blowing me off for calibrations. The dynamics between the characters are fascinating, especially when two are talking in the back of your rover and you witness their relationships forming over shared trauma, personal experiences, and how much everyone wants to throw Liam out the nearest window. [i] Speaking of relationships, [/i] the options for your romance are plentiful and in this game, you have several options for who Ryder can pair up with who range from obscure to downright luvy dovey. I ended up with Vetra but Reyes sure tempted me, all the relationships feel very down to earth (for lack of a better term) and realistic which I really enjoyed. And finally Ryder: off the bat, some of their lines are a flat swing and a miss, not all of the jokes(?) really land and the character creator no matter how hard you try will somehow make your character come out ugly as sin. What I do like is what Ryder means to the player, Shepard (while a fantastic protagonist) always felt larger than life and not exactly relatable, Ryder on the other hand is new to this and we get to be with them as they go through their own Virmire story. Overall, the plot lacks but the characters (if they are ever given similar attention as the OG trilogy characters) could go down as some if the best in the series. [h1] Plot: 6.0/10 Cast: 9/10 [/h1]

The combat is really smooth and has a lot of customisation. The worlds are graphically very nice, some of the landscapes are incredible.
I like the character of Sara a lot, again just don't compare her to Shepard - she's an explorer when the game begins, not a hero, so she has a really nice character arc over the main story as she tries to step up to a role she shouldn't really be in.

The game does have quite a lot of fluff, and I think that brings it down a bit unfortunately. It's much more open world and a lot of it is filled with very trivial and uninteresting missions and tasks.
However, I think if you stick to the key worlds story missions, the companion loyalty missions and the main story missions it  is a good experience. I wouldn't recommend spending much time at all on the ""Tasks"" folder of the journal.

1. [b]Story[/b] - It feels like the story was written by 50 unpaid interns in parallel who never talked to each other. The dialogues are cringe and cliche, there is no intrigue, everything is predictable. Yet nothing makes sense, there are too many plot holes and architected stupidity.
2. [b]Level Design[/b] - The most boring level design I have seen in any game so far. Everything is so low effort, even I can crank out a level or two of this quality in an afternoon. The open world is just empty with pointless commute. It seems that the level designers just slapped a few boxes and spawned a few enemies and went for lunch.
3. [b]Loading screens[/b] - The loading screens are infuriatingly long. What doesnt help where many missions are just sitting through the loading screens and just pressing left click when the level loads and doing it again. There was no effort put into making this game fun. Its a chore.
4. [b]Bugs[/b] - Looks like most of the bugs from 2017 were patched. I did run into a few, but it wasnt game breaking.
5. [b]Movement[/b] - There is a tradeoff between realistic animation and responsive controls. There is a good reason why game designers sacrifice animation for controls especially in a game which expects you to platform so much.
6. [b]SuDoKu[/b] - Why? Just why? At least you can skip them for 500 credits.
7. [b]Mining and Research[/b] - Its not good game design to add shitty mechanics and then make them optional. If it is not fun, dont add it to the game.
8. [b]Choices[/b] - Choices dont matter, not even in the short term. There is a mission where the dialog options tell and NPC to stay or leave. I chose you need to leave option, the NPC replied no and just stayed!
9. [b]Enemy variety[/b] - It does not have 20 different types of enemy. It has four. Namely, cannon fodder, shield guy, bullet sponge and invisible guy. The palette swaps but you use the same tactics in every encounter no matter whom you are fighting with.
10. [b]Input Lag[/b] - There is a 300-500ms delay between you click and bullet firing. It doesnt make a huge deal for short range weapons like shotguns but is a huge dealbreaker for sniper. Also, the bullet velocity of sniper rifles are absurdly slow. The enemies routinely dodge my bullets by just crouching AFTER I pressed left click on their head.
11. [b]Nerfed biotics[/b] - EA probably nerfed most weapons in the game to increase the time to kill in multiplayer mode. The single player suffers for that.
12. [b]Terraforming[/b] - After terraforming, you dont really get to see too much difference. It was sand dunes before, it is sand dunes now. Show me, dont tell me.

As everyone probably knows, the writing is bland, the characters are bland, the animations are wooden at best and goofy at worst. But the worst thing here is that, gameplay-wise, it just isn't polished at all. The interface is clunky and overfilled with useless information. It takes ten mouseclicks to get anything done in a menu. Character lines and quests are muddled and happen out of order--at one point, my character was wondering aloud about a mystery she'd already solved, and then when she got to a new location, called someone she hadn't met yet to update them. There's all sorts of systems that seem like they could be good ideas, but aren't implemented well at all--mining, research & development, profiles... and then there's systems that have somehow been made worse than they were in the first Mass Effect, like the inventory and the vehicle.

One of the more ridiculous components, which I absolutely must mention because I cannot believe it is in the game, is that the first time you talk to anyone on your ship, one of your ~3 options is just ""blatantly flirt with this person."" It's sillier than the Shepard ""we'll bang ok?"" meme. Some people shut you down immediately (if their/your gender is wrong) and others welcome it.

You must quickly murder these people who are defending their planets from you so that you can steal all their resources and forcefully terraform them using your Geometry Dash pyramids left behind by the Forerunners from Halo. Along the way you will acquire a crew of misfits, such as Purple Female, Purple Male, Purple Female but irrelevant and Monkey. You and your gang of imbeciles will conquer the galaxy and bring cholera to all its native inhabitants.

It's fun but it's not worth putting yourself through it's journey at all unless you're just literally looking for brainrot because after the beginning of the game..everything just starts to suck.

I played this game when it initially came out on PS4 and decided to pick it up on PC because I don't know, I thought it might've been more optimized but I came across more glitches on this port than my actual PS4. There are literal moments where I'm falling through the floor, enemies are teleporting. I have three quests in my journal that are glitched and one main quest that I had to start an entire chapter over because I fell through the floor and all of my saves kept loading me underneath the map. (FYI becareful on the asteroid, this is where my game broke a lot.)

*SPOILERS BELOW, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK*




The combat is fun! I love running around shooting stuff it's definitely a lot more interactive than the last few mass effect games which is pretty dope. I however don't like the fact that they scrapped down your companions to just people you bring along missions just to shoot things, they've completely scrapped letting you use the ability tree of your squadmates so alot of your builds/missions depend on what pathfinder profile you choose rather on what squadmates you wanna bring along. This honestly wouldn't be much of a problem if it wasn't for the fact your teammates kind of throw skills whenever they feel like it, their AI is pretty much braindead unless it comes to taking cover or shooting which sucks considering how dope the combat system is.


The quests don't feel like they contribute anything to the story at all aside from literally being there to keep you from making a beeline to the end by completing the main story missions, for example there's a couple of quests you get where you're helping the scientist of the Nexus understand the wildlife/plant system/minerals of the system including some that actually contribute to how much food the nexus can grow which you would assume is something monumental but nope, it's a side quest that the minute you complete is never mentioned again, nothing about the animals or the minerals or the plants that you're pretty much going to cultivate to feed thousands of people.  I can understand having completely unrelated quests to the game but even in the Mass Effect trilogy, hell any other RPG game I've played there's never really been an instance where not one of my side quests didn't come back to bite me in the ass or show the fruits of your work. It's disheartening that a lot of the quests that do this in this game are explicably tied to the main quest(like the helping making the area safe for the outposts, those are honestly the only quests from the top of my head that kind of reward you for doing them)

There are also these random RNG quests you get per planet that you can pick up accidentally because your SAM will tell you there's something nearby that either needs to be scanned/destroyed. What I mean by RNG is that once you destroy/scan this initial ""quest item"" it is up to you to hunt for it based off of the hints provided in your journal, which are very very vague and sometimes, like pretty much 70% of the game, are unfortunately glitched so this could take an incredibly long time if you're a completionist who doesn't want to leave an area until they've completed everything in said planet. I've had this happen to me a couple of times early on in the game and my only solution to this was either to manually save multiple times before picking up said quests or just ignoring them because they eventually get incredibly tedious and they're pretty much copy pasted across all explorable planets with the exception of one.

The story is the main driving point of this game and now that I've played it twice I realize it doesn't make much sense at all. The enemy seems to have a pointless reason to hate you aside ""ALIEN LEARN TECHNOLOGY BETTER THAN ME BOOHOO"", your choices don't matter at all because it seems like they set this game up so your consequences follow into whatever sequel they where planning for this game, everyone your Ryder can romance automatically assumes you're flirting with them and are actively trying to pursue a relationship with them which makes no sense to me because all Mass Effect games I've played you had to work to gaining that relationship/loyalty, but in this you can literally choose anything and do their loyalty mission and despite what you choose at the end no matter how messed up it is your romance interest goes ""Ya im loyal to you"" or you can cuss out your romance interest and still pick up the romance. (Reyes for example).

The companions.. are interesting. To sum it up, all non-human companions are pretty much the best thing that you can get when it comes to comical relief with actual character development, your human companions try to hard to be something they aren't and it ends up backfiring a lot without any real character development so I regularly avoid bringing them to missions unless absolutely necessary.

Lastly, Cora is hands down the worst companion I've ever had in ANY game. She on her own needs an entire review section to herself because her entire personality revolves around being an asari huntress and she literally does not shut the fuck up about it, she's constantly belittling your achievements because she still believes deep in her heart that your MC's father should've chosen her instead of you until her loyalty mission where she finds out how difficult it is to make monumental decisions and then that's when she decides that she needs to lay off of you a bit but even then, she has the personality of a fucking celery stick. I actively avoid speaking to her because each conversation you have with her feels like pins and needles in your fucking skull.",1629409616,1629426684,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Combat is great, fast paced, smooth transition between skills and weapons, quite diverse when it comes to combos, a lot of weapon and gear varieties and the ability to augment and modify them to suit your style and I'm really impressed that you only need to get close to a wall to automatically get into cover and it's really easy to get out of it when you need to, it's really handy. So there is a great deal of RPG elements playing the game and it's easy to switch since it doesn't really affect you permanently when you pick a class in the character creation. The character creation is disappointing, I mean while there is a lot of features to choose from you are still forced to only play as a human, it would have been more fun to be able to choose between at least a few races  then go from there. However when it comes to the story it's basic, same as Dragon's Age Inquisition but different landscape, The Breach or The Scourge, The Chantry or The Initiative, nobody belives in you in the begging but they slowly start to acknowledge you. The dialogue and romance between characters is written by a bunch of teenagers and feel like your choice of words don't really matter. Graphics are fantastic, every world you visit feels immersive, every special effect you see is a pleasure to look at. Meanwhile the facial animation are almost nonexistent, can't really understand what characters go through if they smile, laugh, frown or talk with using only 5% facial muscles. The sound design is great, the actors that dub the script of the game makes the experience a lot better and the score, sound effects and ambient sound keep you immersed in the world. But the sound mixing is terrible, characters talk over each other, when someone interrupts Ryder they use voice comms to do so even though they are sitting right next to them. If one of your companions or you AI talks and you go through a checkpoint they almost every time switch the topic according to mission or just talk one over another. Sometimes audio goes off during cinematic scene and comeback on when actual gameplay starts again which is a bummer. Performace wise, the game runs smooth on maximum settings, but for whatever reasons it picks stupid spots where the framerate drops, for example in the ship, when looking a specific way it goes from 60fps to 30-40, you'd thing in the ship there are many things  your PC has to calculate. Missions are kind of all the same, go there, investigate that, grab three of those. The in-game puzzle are basically sudoku with alien hieroglyphs but the most annoying thing is with the additional tasks where some of them have items that have to be picked up or scanned but they spawn at random enemy camp location on the map, and sometimes you have to back to the ship, reload the map in order to spawn them again in case you can no longer find them. Speaking of the ship, somethings, like crafting, talking to some NPCs, advancing mission and doing idle mission can be done there, but in order to do that, you have to enter the ship, wait for a cut scene showing you leave the planet to end, do your thing on the ship, go to galaxy map, select that you want to land back and see another cut scene even though you never intended to leave the planet in the first place. While most of the issues in this game can be fixed using mods made by people that actually care, to enjoy the full experience, I don't see the reason to pay for a game that is supposedly finished. 

In conclusion, if you want to have a great combat experience with great graphics and sound design this game is for you and it's worth it at a discounted price.

There's a few positive thing i can say about the game, for example, the dialogues between characters are fun, the story is alright i guess, wasn't anything special really, the scale of it is nothing compared to the original one, it never made me feel like we're in any danger. 

They gave us a huge pool of skills to chose from, which confuses me, why let us choose a specialization at the beginning like in the other games,  when it literally doesn't matter what you chose, which wouldn't be so bad, i really like to min max my characters, so being able to chose skills from other trees is really good, at least it would be if they allowed you to have more than 3 skill on your hotbar at once.

Starting this game after I played Dragon Age Inquisition I noticed off the back a lot of things that were similar from the choice matter set up, the character customization, traveling an open world doing random side quest and picking up materials, to even a crafting system that was only there but not needed cause you can find everything.

If you came to play a game with a great story, then turn away. The story, well there is none just you finding a home that is threatened by someone (Just like Dragon Age). The only connections you make are with your companion side quests. The combat is fast past with you being able to play how you want to, either running in with melee, casting fire balls from range or just picking heads off with a sniper. 

After awhile of playing the game you will come to notice that you are just repeating the same thing over and over no mater what planet you lane on. You land, you drive around, you complete a few side quest, pick up some materials, complete the main objective, create a base then leave. Go to next planet and so on. 

If you want to try it, buy on sell but do not play this before or after Dragon Age: Iq cause its going to be a major turn off.

maybe its just because i have higher standards for writing since im more interested in books or movies for story, but this game felt like it had comparable writing quality to the rest of the series - that is to say, fun, but nothing to send letters home to ma about. that being said, the peebee romance fucking rocks - probably best in the series if you play through as a girl (wouldnt be true if jack were, as she should be, gay). though im sad theres not a more sapphic and perhaps more depthy romance option for the angara cuz boy are they cute.

really i think even the people who played legendary edition recently are seeing the writing through rose-tint. i deeply enjoy this series but come on its no charlie kaufman, you feel me? murakami could shit on this series, but it wouldnt make a fun game, right?

by far the best combat in all of the mass effect series, just way better mechanics, exploring planets feels tight which was just never the case in any other game, though good lord i wish theyd stop it with needing to spend so much time grabbing all the planets to find stuff. the car? it rocks, its fun, have you driven the mako? it was horrible, i've spent maybe 3 playthroughs in that god forsaken vehicle and ill take anything over that but shit not since half life 2ep2 was a car been this fun for me. wish you could run shit over better tho i understand the mechanic choice.

i dont like the research system, but the crafting system was fun if oft nonsensical? slightly upset that the hurricane didnt go BRRRRR like in ME3, truly a gun worth having around just for the sound in that game. complaints about the hesh i think are sort of unfounded as i played on hardcore and had no problem dishing out damage with the piranha. black widow as good as ever tho. fun/10 guns for the most part, plenty of room for experimentation before you settle on your end-game build.

let me briefly touch on the models here - the asari look like shit, that is true, but it seems to be because they all are based on poor natalie dormer's fat face. a real tragedy, as she is one of the few girls who cant pull no hair.

First time I've tried it when it came out, I've quit it during the Eos playthrough, because of technical issues it was suffering from, side characters and writing that seemed so bad at first.

I gave this game another shot after several years and I must say that it's not bad as I thought it was and as huge majority of gamers thought. Of course that it's not good as the original triology (there are few games that  good in general) but I believe that it really had the potential that was destroyed by the BioWare and (deserved) backlash by the gamers worldwide. I really liked the story and the gameplay, but I'm still not a fan of dialogues and some of the side characters. Some of the dialogues sounded like they are from some cheesy SF/Action show, like Power Rangers.

Still, I'm really sad that BioWare has completely abandoned this game and that it will never be completely patched and that we'll never see the DLC (cliffhanger from the epilogue).

Should you play it? Probably.
Do I recommend it? No.
(This review does not include multiplayer, but you're looking at a Mass Effect game, so no need anyway)

Let me explain:
It's not the same as Mass Effect 1-3, but it is not a bad thing. It does things differently and enjoyable in its own way, while still keeping some good references and easter eggs [spoiler]Why did you press this button? Don't press the button![/spoiler]
It's a lot more open world, like ME1 driving around but with actual things happening on the planet.

The good parts:
The open world exploration of the planets feels great. The characters are engaging (Who is the better Krogan, Drack or Wrex? Discuss.) The voice acting delivers. A lot of attention went into the story. It looks great. The weapon upgrade/creation system makes it easy to find your playstyle (Bio-converting Black Widow best gun fite me). Controls felt smooth.

The mediocre part:
A good portion of the sidequests are kinda a pain, leading you across multiple planets, running after things (the worst is when you leave a planet and get a mail with ""Hey, meet me on the planet we [i]literally[/i] left just now"").
Some details feel slightly off, for example how it seems the artists made a couple planets, the writers came up with some planet descriptions and some intern had to find the best fitting pairs.

Now, the reasons for the red thumbs-down:
The bugfest, while only rarely game-crashing, was way too annoying and should not be allowed in a game of this caliber. Voicelines get cut off regularly, sometimes you'll have 2 overlayed, some play again and again even though you have long done the quest they belong to. One of the game crashers I had was in the final cutscene, which I rather not enjoyed.
Sometimes you get stuck on something invisble in the floor. Or your squadmates just hang out under the floor, maybe their head sticks out a bit if you're lucky.
If you decide to infiltrate a base from the backdoor, be ready, cause your enemies are gonna spawn right in your face. No one thought about players not taking the front door into an ambush.
Or the UX in the menu: ""Hey, you have new info concerning a quest! Not gonna tell you which one tho! (Maybe it's one hiding in your long list of completed quests? Not gonna tell"", similarly, the map will sometimes get questmarkers stuck, without you being able to access the quest. Somehow, I managed to get a codex entry that is constantly 'unread', even if I take a long and hard look at it.

If you can see past these problems, go ahead, buy it and have fun discovering a whole new part of the universe.
But, as you can see, in my opinion, the bad overshadowed the good too much for a recommendation. A game in this state is not okay, and it's sad, because without these faults, it would be near the top of my favourites.

TL;DR: You will enjoy this, if you can ignore a host of (mostly) harmless, but painfully annoying bugs.",1629070419,1629070419,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's not Shepard's story, it's Ryder's story. 

I absolutely love the characters (Vetra, Jaal, and Peebee being my favorites). They're all well-written and have genuinely interesting stories. 

After months of playing games from the late 2000s-early 2010s, Andromeda opened my eyes to how far we have come in video game graphics. The first thing I noticed was hair physics. I was speechless when I saw that my Ryder's hair bounced when she was running/jogging. Motion capture has done such wonders for the gaming industry. Before, kisses were just clipping through each other's faces. I went apesh*t when I saw a kiss scene in this game for the first time. The developers actually managed to sculpt the lips touching each other. I was astounded, ASTOUNDED.

Anyway, yes, please give this game a try. The beginning is a little slow, but once you're in, it's so much fun.

Hugely and unfairly lambasted, Andromeda is, in my eyes, a solid entry in the Mass Effect franchise and a worthy successor to the original trilogy. Masterful character writing accompany you along a serviceable story and interesting and sprawling locales to explore.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
If you've played the original trilogy, you'll be right at home in Andromeda. The core combat mechanics are familiar, though you'll find a lot more freedom to develop your character as you're not locked into a single class; you can pick and choose as you go, and change your specialty whenever you like, [i]even mid-combat[/i], to suit your immediate needs. Jumping and hovering has been added, allowing encounters to be more mobile than the trilogy.
Jumping/hovering also impacts the world design, as greater mobility allows environments to be more flexible in their layout. Maps are a lot more open than those of the trilogy, enabling more exploration and interesting sights and scenery.
As one of the two Ryder twins, your primary objective is to prepare worlds for settlement by the pioneers who traveled with you from the Milky Way, and you do so by completing objectives that improve the habitability of those worlds. There are some tedious objectives, but you can freely skip most of them, as it's possible to reach 100% viability on every world without them, and there are no in-game advantages to a completionist run.
Dialogue and choices—arguably the thing Mass Effect is most famous for—is markedly improved in Andromeda, eschewing a morality system for more personality-driven choices. No longer do you have to choose between being a violent, racist juicebag or Captain America: Andromeda lets you decide between being passionate, clinical, snarky, or reserved, all of which generate more interesting and organic dialogue, especially with your companions. Your choices also impact the game to a degree, with some consequences appearing almost immediately.

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
Andromeda is [i]gorgeous,[/i] but expect it to put your system through its paces on higher settings. With a 1070ti I could play with most settings on high (textures on maximum, you'll want this for the close-ups in dialogue) and get a steady 60fps. Effects are clean and iconic (Mass Effect's trademark lens flares make a good showing here), and design is on point, with characters, equipment, and environments feeling thoughtful, on-brand, and well-made.
The environments you explore are distinct and well-modeled, ranging from bright and clean stations, to dark jungles, frozen wastes, arid deserts, and more. Nothing feels copy-pasted—something I can't say about the trilogy (looking at you, ME1's crate warehouses). Exploring the cluster is fun as well; zooming from planet to planet provides more immersive exploration than piloting your little RC Normandy around a map.
The character designer, while not as customizeable as the trilogy, is robust enough to offer a reasonably distinct character for your playthrough, and I think this is for the best: the more wildly different a character model can be, the harder it becomes to animate well. A 300lb person doesn't move the same way a 150lb person does.
The other characters' designs are excellent, especially your crew. Many critics cite the game's animated facial expressions as a poor choice, but, while not perfect, I find them a step above the trilogy's. I like how Ryder can actually smile—Shepherd's ""smiles"" always look like they're in pain. Notably, I can even tell when turians are smiling. Again, it's not perfect—folks' eyes have a tendency to dart about a little too much—but in general, I'll take too bouncy and animated over the original trilogy's lack of emotion.
The only visual quirk I found quite distracting was Krogans' eyes, which point outwards instead of towards whatever they're looking at. They look kind of doofy. The Salarian's eyes were inexplicably changed as well, but not distractingly, and there is a mod to restore them to their trilogy look if you prefer.

[h3]Audio[/h3]
Music is probably Andromeda's weakest creative point; while not bad by any stretch—appropriate to the series and events on-screen—it also lacks the iconic feel of the trilogy. I can certainly pick out of my mind one or two key tracks from the trilogy; not so much with Andromeda.
...Actually, scratch that: there is one [i]stunning[/i] track, ""Under the Stars"", that plays in the credits. I don't know if it's intentional, but the effects on the vocals in that song give it a very turian feel to me, and it is a superlative cap to the game.
The voice-acting, on the other hand, is excellent, as is its application. The characters' actors capture powerful emotion and carry the writing excellently—especially the light tone of the dialogue, which has a much more humorous and snarky feel than the trilogy. I recall one moment in particular where I was driving on a low-gravity world and ramped into the air for many seconds of hangtime and Vetra just exploded with laughter. Or another where I almost drove off a cliff and Jaal screamed ""RYDER, NOOO!"" The actors are a joy.

[h3]Story[/h3]
The main story of the game is sufficient to drive the gameplay, but nothing extraordinary, and I'll agree with other critics that it does retread a bit of what we've seen in Mass Effect before: technology left behind by long-dead ancient civilizations, an enemy who wishes to assimilate all living beings, etc. It's not particularly inspired, but it does the job.
Where Andromeda [i]really[/i] shines is in its characters and dialogue, and the story arcs that explore them. Andromeda improves on the excellent character depiction and development in the trilogy by giving your companions much more interaction with each other. They'll casually chat on the ship, and as you drive around the worlds, your companions will have conversations with each other that further their development and foster a sense of friendship amongst the team that the trilogy was lacking.
As mentioned above, the story has a markedly lighter feel than the trilogy—an improvement in my eyes. The trilogy's epic story sometimes feels like a major bummer, and light moments are few and far between. Andromeda, by contrast, peppers in snark and comedy to keep things from getting too morose, and gives the characters more personality and charm.
Romance is a Mass Effect staple, and you'll find no lack of it here—in fact, I was surprised at how many romance options there are. Beyond the expection options among the crew, I found folks to romance on the worlds I explored as well. For my first playthrough I focused on Vetra, and the payoff of that arc is a hilarious and touching moment that you'll have to play to see for yourself.
Overall, Andromeda made me sad to say goodbye to these characters I've gotten to know, and that is probably the highest praise I can give to any piece of writing.

[h3]Additional Thoughts[/h3]
The bugginess of the game's launch is unfortunate stain on the game's reputation. With the latest patches, I did experience some bugs, but... Skyrim won Game of the Year. It's ten years later and Skyrim is [i]still[/i] buggier than Andromeda. A game can be buggy and still be great. Yes, there were a couple times in Andromeda where things got janky—I caught Cora T-posing behind a conversation once, and Jaal's cape started inflating at one point—but these experiences were rare, and I experienced nothing game-breaking. The reputation of this game as a buggy mess isn't warranted—or at least it isn't anymore.
Mods are available and I think many do improve the quality of the game, like speeding up the Nomad vehicle. I highly recommend a mod to increase your carrying capacity. Inventory management is a tedious mechanic that should be reserved for survival sims and horror games, not open-world explorers. That said, mods can be buggy too; if you experience things like crashes or frame-rate drops, check your mods.",1628842143,1628842143,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You can now travel directly on the worlds again which really adds to the immersion, even if it can get a bit tedious from time to time. The game is quite a bit longer than the original games, but that is something I personally prefer.

Pros:
1 - I like the combat. being able to hover for better shots is great.

3 - The discussions between squad mates can be funny to listen to.

Cons.
1- Visual bugs still exist. Not game breaking, but still there. I tried drinking at a bar and drank air.
2 - Audio bugs still exist. Lips moved and no sound came out.

Don't expect ME 4, expect a game that rests on its own merits and isn't just another EA rehash/reboot. Expect ThinOrigin to be the bane of your existence. That's an EA problem, not a BioWare problem.

Graphics: 10/10

I know that at launch this'd be more of a 5/10, but thankfully, the devs actually got to fixing the issues brought up over the years. As such, it might be a surprise to you, but this game actually supports raytracing. Not officially mind you, but, it can be enabled via console. I personally think it makes the game outright gorgeous when enabled, though, I'd probably not recommend it if you're running on a potato or even lower-mid-range rig. You don't need an RTX card to make it work though. I've a GTX 1050ti and have full raytracing. For the most part the mocap on characters in conversations and the character models themselves are gorgeous. As you can expect from a BioWare game, yes, you can make your very own dissimilar main character tweaked however you want. I stuck with the default female Ryder because, I think she's hot the way she is, though probably not to everyone's preferences. The landscapes are gorgeous and are a joy to explore. 

I won't say it's on a No Man's Sky level OFC, but then again, there aren't many games out there that can claim to be like NMS so I suppose that point is moot. Regardless, I often found myself standing on the edge of a cliff and staring down, or, standing in an ancient alien room staring all around. They truly did an amazing job, especially in contrast to ME 1 and 2 where, sure, you have a ton more locations to land, but they're either just mazes to drive through or a cookie cutter land that falls into one of only a few different planet types. 

That is something I should probably clarify come to think of it. The game is not vast in terms of amounts of planets/planetoids you can land on, in ME 1-3 you fly around the greater portion of the galaxy, whereas in Andromeda you are limited to the local cluster. Keep in mind that's very relevant since there are no Mass Relays in Andromeda. 

All that being said, that's not to say there's less geography to exlore. IMO, there's more in fewer worlds. Each world has its own personality and is very different to the others. Each is a separate whole versus the many worlds of the trilogy that seem more like a hodge podge mix and match of different land feature crammed together with a fresh coat of paint. 

I can't reiterate enough at how breathtaking the worlds are. There were full hours I'd stand at the edge of something just to stare out into the distance, or drive around just to see everything I can.

My only complaint is there are still some oddities with the character models that they didn't sort out since the trilogy. Some of the races have very distinct differences between models, but, especially in the case of the Asari non-essential NPC's, it looks like the only variations are strictly the patterns or paint applied to them. Now, for those waxing nostalgia, don't get me twisted, there's a definite improvements over the trilogy. I played the Legendary Edition side by side and I can say, it's night and day. IDK about 3 because I've not gotten too far into it since my last play was when I bought it used for my XBOX 360 and promptly quit playing when I realized at how much content that should've been core game were locked away behind around $100 or more. Still, it's important to note that improvement is there, it's just not as developed as it could've been... thanks to EA yanking dev leads in charge of character design for their horrible dumpster fire ""Discount Iron Man"" simulator while Andromeda was being produced. 

I could go on for a long time about the graphics, however, I'll have to revisit this when I've summarized the rest because right now I'm already writing a novella. 

Sound: 10/10 

I haven't noticed any audio issues and the directional audio on headphones works pretty good for the most part. Everything sounds balanced and everything sounds crisp and as if the cast were talking directly into your ears. Can't really think of any negatives. The voice actors do there parts pretty good and everything comes together for a decent immersive experience.

Controls: 8/10

I should be rating this higher, but can't due to the ThinOrigin client borking Steam Overlay and making it difficult to use a gamepad. If you're on mouse/keyboard you'll probably rate this higher. It controls just fine with that combo. I prefer gamepad for this game due to how deep the combat is and to me it feels more natural. Now, you might see reviews lamabasting the game for not having gamepad support. It does, it just takes some doing to get the gamepad to work. Namely, doing what you can to limit ThinOrigin from interfering as much as possible and adding Andromeda as a non-steam game and launching the actual game via Big Picture mode after force enabling steam input.... it's a process but I can't rightfully deduct too much since that's an issue that most ThinOrigin games I've played face and less to do with this game.

The only other thing that's a bit weird is that in order to use combat abilities, it's LB/L1 for ability 1, RB/R1 for ability 2 or LB+RB for ability 3. That's a bit weird and I'd wanted to rebind it elsewhere on the controller but the game makes efficient use of the rest.

Gameplay: 10/10 - It's very enjoyable, especially combat which is fast and frenetic, but doesn't make you want to just bunker up and shoot things/take cover/shoot things/take cover. Don't get me wrong, you [i]can[/i] do that, but the sorts of skills you unlock can make it just as rewarding or more rewarding than just sitting behind a box and playing whack-a-baddie. There are some story related bosses, though, that you [b]really[/b] don't want to do. In other words, kiting is your friend, melee isn't useless and although biotics are still OP (you bet your arse that you can learn singularity), don't expect to cheese the enemies with Singularity Skeet-shooting, not everyone will fly in the air with biotics. This is a good thing. 

Non-combat is great imo as well. It's not just one gameplay loop repeating itself with minor permutations. You're tasked with settling worlds for the ARK's to inhabit and find a lost ARK or two that never showed up at rendevous. To make matters more complicated, turns out that you'll also have to make first contact and try not to start a war you have neither the time, resources or personnel to fight. 

When you do a thing, it matters. There are a lot of times you do a thing and don't get any tangible reward, however, there's a sense of progression the game instills in you, you feel like you accomplished something. The point is more in the action and less on the thing itself, yet, other times you'll find yourself doing something that seems inconsequential to find out that if you hadn't done that thing the colonies would be set back. 

Each colony you work on building up from the ground gives a sense of achievement I hardly feel in games. You spend hours doing various things to make it so that hundreds of peoplesicles can get thawed out and brought planet-side to start a brand new life in a brand new sky in an unknown galaxy. The gameplay reinforces this experience, it highlights the kind of pride you feel when you go to a world, do things by the seat of your pants just winging it and hoping to make the world habitable, then leave to do other things when you've established the planets colony only to come back and find that there's actually development and things have started to build up. I have to give credit where it's due. The skeleton crew who somehow managed to make this game despite EA's interference really did an amazing job, and I feel for them that this beautiful game has such a bad reputation when it's very clear that they, the team, poured a lot of TLC into crafting this gem. I really hope that this project isn't a one-off.",1628683135,1628683135,True,0,0,0.470035254955291748,0,True,False,False

The problem is the quality of that content. It starts with the characters. The main character, Scott/Sara Ryder, was always facing an uphill battle being compared to Shepard, but he becomes the protagonist by sheer accident. Where Shepard was an N7, Ryder is just a grunt with no noteworthy skills. To make things worse, the entire reason he can do ANYTHING is because he's hooked up to an AI. That's what makes him ""special"".

However, most other characters aren't interesting either. It doesn't help that most of the game consists of copy/pasted ugly models so you're in a universe of potato-faced people. I tried to not let it bother me but it is really immersion-breaking.

An ME game is incomplete without the player companions, and they're boring. And useless. In previous ME games, your squad mattered and brought useful abilities to the table, that you could actually manage. In Andromeda, your companions get KOed easily, their abilities are automatic, and they constantly get in your way. The worst bit is their personalities are BORING, with the exception of the new alien.

Andromeda is unnecessarily large, and to compensate, filled with pointless sidequests. From mechanical problems to finding people, there's no problem too small but it requires Ryder and his miraculous AI. Not only are these quests insanely tedious, they make the NPCs feel incompetent.

The main story is pretty good, as are some of the companion quests. There's some solid writing there, and the missions were fun. If the filler was stripped out, this game would be completed in half the time easily, and be a lot more enjoyable. A lot of time is also wasted on the incessant landing/take-off cutscences, which are mostly unskippable.

Even with the decent story, I never felt like I was actually doing something to further the Andromeda Initiative's goals, Ryder just mops up random problems until a planet becomes viable.

On just about every planet you will have to solve 3 sudoku-type puzzles at 3 very similar-looking alien buildings, then you will have to explore a very similar ""Vault"" to push a button. I got tired of this padding very quickly.

Furthermore, the dialogue and narrative often seemed weak and lazy. For example, the only reason you are important is that your daddy was the previous Pathfinder and made you his successor when he died. I just couldn't stop wondering why all the other characters basically just shrugged their shoulders and casually accepted that obvious (and inexplicable) act of nepotism.

And the game has other consistent irritants, such as the pointless (and only partially skippable) animation that plays every time you fly between planets. And your only reward at the destination is the occasional patch of minerals or research points and some lame descriptive text, usually along the lines of ""This planet is dead - probably because of space magic"".

Bottom line - if you need a technically competent game with decent combat, a lot of repetitive quests and indifferent writing, then ME:A is for you. I recommend waiting until it goes on sale.",1628305253,1628305253,False,1,0,0.477941185235977173,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong. It had - and has - its issues. It's still buggier than I would expect a game from a major studio, never mind such an iconic series - to be. There's some interface things that are frustrating, such as the lengthy animation when landing/leaving planets, or that dialog will get interrupted by a message you've heard 1000 times (Which is itself, an issue). But, all that said, the game is well worth the time you put in to it. The big thing to remember is that this is not Mass Effect 1-3, and you shouldn't expect it to be. Treat it like it is - a game in a whole new galaxy with a whole new cast, and I think you'll find it enjoyable.

The game improved on a lot of the mechanics of ME1-3 in a big way. The fact that you and your twin's face are actually changeable post character creation, and the ability to change between different ""classes"" at will are very welcome additions, especially since you can re-spec them as you play. The banter between the characters in the Nomad, and some of the off-the-cuff remarks gave me genuine chuckles. I also really appreciate that the paragon/renegade system was done away with. It gives you the freedom to answer as you/your character would, not how you need to in order to get the good outcome. There's also a number of dialogs where there isn't a clear right/wrong answer - something I did not see often in the original trilogy and was glad to see here.

I only played this game post-patches, but I never found the facial animations to be too bad, save for a few specific scenes, but I never found myself laughing when I wasn't meant to. The voice acting from some secondary characters can be a bit uninspired in places too, but again - nothing experience-ruining. And all told, I saw way more animation glitches in the original trilogy than I did in this game.

Definitely recommend giving this game a play through. Give it a chance, and don't expect it to be ME1-3, because it isn't. Go in to it with an open mind and let the story play out without comparing every facet to the previous games and you'll find yourself genuinely having fun.",1628280340,1628280340,True,26,0,0.645101606845855713,0,True,False,False

I downloaded the Frosty Mod Manager and about a dozen mods with a mix of graphics and game balance. I remember back on release being very frustrated with the glitches and bugs. Both in Graphics and in quest breaking among other bugs. 

Now the real question is ""Well how does it compare to the OG Trilogy?"". Truthfully it's a hard question to answer, in some ways it does things better than the original, and others it's much worse. Andromeda is a separate galaxy with a different protag and cast of characters. I'll start with talking about what Andromeda does better as it's a shorter list than what it does worse.

Mass Effect Andromeda does exploration much better than the original. Granted the only Mass Effect game prior that had it more than a side DLC was the first and it was pretty bare bones. The Nomad is much better than the Mako and the Hammerhead from the OG. Despite not having any weapons it handles better and feels like it's actually suited for ground exploration. Going around the worlds in the cluster and discovering sites and investigating leads felt somewhat rewarding. Combat is also much more fluid and enjoyable than the OG Trilogy. You can actually jump now and have some neat power combos, but the combat difficulties are still pretty broken. Insanity is just too crazy with some bosses that can one shot you in cover sometimes despite full shields to where you have to change the difficulty just to get past certain bosses. However that's my only real complaint with the combat.

The Mods certainly aided in my experience. I had over a dozen mods for graphic and balance updates which gave me a better overall experience. Didn't fix any story issues, but at least the facelift and QOL updates helped.

Now for what it does worse than the OG Trilogy. In my opinion the thing that made the original games so well loved and respected was the fantastic cast of characters with interesting and compelling backstories and motivations. From Wrex, Garrus, Thane, Mordin, and Jack to side characters like Admiral Anderson and Major Kirahe. However Andromeda has a majority of poorly written characters. There are some good characters like Drack, Vetra, and Peebee to an extent, but they feel like the exception and not the rule (Drack is still my fav in Andromeda tho). In the original trilogy, Shepherd felt like a real commander with the respect and admiration of his crew no matter if Paragon or Renegade to an extent. However in Andromeda you have characters like Liam who constantly plan major stuff behind your character's back. (No Spoilers) Even when he majorly messes up he acts like nothing big happened and doesn't really change or evolve for it. 

Another issue is character development. One of the best parts of Mass Effect 2 (My favorite in the series), you get to see your squadmates develop through their own personal mission as you can help influence them in some ways big or small. To see them grow and resolve their issues or Trauma was extremely satisfying and really helped you feel like you were a part of a family on the Normandy. Andromeda doesn't have that, despite having all of the pressure on your character you never feel like your character's outlook or your squads outlook have changed at all outside of the romances. 

The last main issue I have with the game is the overall story and villain. Without giving too much away, it feels like a rip off of the OG Trilogy, and a bad one at that. Despite different circumstances there isn't nearly as much mystery and lore about the prior species that you encounter their artifacts early on. You learn bits and pieces, but there's no real mystery or awe there. The villain is super cookie cutter and honestly super boring. With the first Mass Effect game the main bad guy Saren had legit motivations to a degree and was trying to save organic life even if it was in a twisted way. However the bad guy in Andromeda is evil for the sake of evil and power. No underlying reason for it and makes him super boring. And before you say the reapers are similar there was a lot of mystery and wonder behind why these machines (not organics) wanted to wipe out all life in the galaxy and then suddenly disappear. 

Overall if you're a Mass Effect Fan who can't wait for the new game to come out, with mods this game can kinda scratch the itch in a small way, but still has a  bad taste in my mouth 4 years later and even with over a dozen mods. Doesn't help that the ending DLC baited super hard for the other Milky way races that never came so there isn't even a fully satisfying conclusion to the main story, because EA dropped all expansion of the title due to poor reception and sales.

TLDR: If your a fan of the OG trilogy, it might be worth getting on sale and downloading some mods to improve it slightly, mostly disappointing characters, story, and villain with some bugs still present years later. 6.5/10",1627942190,1627942190,False,14,0,0.678515613079071045,0,True,False,False

Is this a good game if you separate it from the original trilogy and let it stand on its own two feet? Absolutely. Do I still have a ton of complaints because I personally didn’t really like the game? Absolutely.

I loved the premise of Andromeda. Exploring the galaxy and making planets more viable for the colonies to live on, dope, satisfying, up my alley. But actually, not so satisfying. The planets are beautiful and unique, with different biomes and environmental hazards to overcome, but my god did they feel EMPTY. Despite the insane amount of incredibly inane sidequests that aren’t even a LITTLE bit worth your time, still I somehow felt there was nothing to do on any of these planets. You get around fast thanks to the NOMAD, but for what? I felt a greater sense of exploration in the original trilogy, which did not have large open-world areas and was super linear. Dragon Age: Inquisition tried these big open maps and it failed. Despite everyone saying the beloved DA: Origins was immensely superior because of its linearity and tight focus on story and pacing, the next Mass Effect tried to do the same thing DA:I did. But why?? Why does everything have to be open world? The Witcher 3 can pull it off because the writing is so damn good and every single sidequest is compelling and interesting and yet we have games like ME:A thinking ping-ponging the player across a map for a single pointless fetch quest is a valid way to pad out a game. 

The repetition of available quests is another issue. The first time you explore a vault, dope, the first time you fight an architect, sick. The second time? Third? So on? UGH. Just when you think you get a quest that’s interesting, no, it’s not, because you’ve seen it before. In other games repetitive quests can be more acceptable due to nice rewards, or because completing them just FEELS good, but ME:A really gives us nothing in return. Despite my almost obsessive need to check off every quest in my journal, I began focusing only on the story quest in order to just finish the game. Is the story quest even good? Well, it’s okay. It’s not bad. It’s serviceable. Unfortunately I ended up not caring how the game ended and so, after 40 hours, and nearing the end of the journey, I simply put the game down and never picked it up again. I was thrown into another vault I didn’t want to be in and I was just done. The fate of every character in this game… couldn’t care less.

The boring/stale characters were the most disappointing part of this game. One of my favorite parts of every Bioware game I have played – meeting your teammates. Conversing with them. Discovering their backstories. Hearing their banter on quests. Choosin who to smooch. Did I care about any of ME:A’s characters? Not really, nah. Peebee and Jaal were fairly interesting, although maybe I only liked Jaal because the Angaara were new. Peebee was the only character who felt solid and alive. I love Krogans and Turians and yet I didn’t give a single f*ck about Drack or Vetra. And don’t think that I took Cora and Liam on a single mission that I didn’t have to take them on because I sure as hell didn’t. Don’t even get me started on NPCs. I guess maybe they tried with Reyes Vidal. I guess. 

I am still giving this game a thumbs-up because at times, I did actually have a lot of fun. And because there are a lot of things to appreciate about this game, especially if it’s your first Mass Effect game. And because I do think a lot of love and care was put into this game, because it’s obvious, even if the end result was lackluster. And because a negative review shouldn’t put someone off buying a game just because the reviewer didn’t personally like it. I’d say grab it on sale and decide for yourself, just manage your expectations.",1627938498,1627938498,True,65,1,0.816918492317199707,0,True,False,False

Hyper Mobility

Road Rage

Makes the Nomad more mobile as well.

Faster Mining

You'll always be pressing 'take all' in this game. Why not automate it?

Faster Kadara Doors
https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffectandromeda/mods/471
I've no idea what slow Kadara doors look like, and I'm glad.

All that pain underclocking your graphics and installing those mods is going to be worth it. It's a whole new galaxy out there.

What sucks:
- 'mailman' quests that'll make you look at the 'hyperspace travel', 'select planet', 'land', 'take off' loading screens ad nauseam

- MMO-esque respawning trash mobs on huge maps

- you can't go into your ship to read e-mail without departing the planet

Guys, I finally finished this game. Honestly this one was made at the wrong time with wrong intentions, at least for me. When one plays the linear story missions or loyalty missions it feels better, not great but good. Having an open world with simply boring tasks was a misstake. I ran around, collecting stuff, killing people, skipping dialogues - watching series while playing to have fun - but when it came to the few story missions I paused any distraction because it was interesting.

Still having this in the ME universe was a misstake. Having only humans for example would be better, so new ""alien"" races could be introduced which is okay. I still can't let the fact go, that there are 4 races present on the hyperion which does not include quarians - quarian mechanics are said to be the best so better not include any? Not even include them in our museum?
I'd make more sense to use the initiative as a secret cerberus or whatever project to protect mankind.

That said, when not thinking about most of this stuff, not expecting a great story but okayish gameplay, this one might be for you. As someone who expected a good story telling game, I stil don't like it. But yes, in the end I'm a bit sad that I can't save the quarians, elcor, drell etc. which where on the other ark.

First of all, gameplay wise this is no game like the other Mass Effect games - if you hoped so, don't play it.

Second - It really feels like playing a bunch of 16 years old, their acting and attitude is just, I don't know it doesn't feel right.

You can loot quite a lot - useless stuff. In fact there are so many chests you can loot but you'll still have nothing of worth. The story feels boring most of the time, there are a lot of side quests which all feel the same. In the end you are just running around a lot.

As this game has a open world approach, it doesn't tell a story anymore. It's merely like any other RPG shooter, often MMORPGs, where you keep grinding and farming stuff instead of playing a good story. I don't know if I'll ever finish this one, but as far as I can see I doubt it.

If you want to feel like youre colonizing new planets in the Mass Effect universe and are willing to put up with the major design flaws of this game: Mass Effect Andromeda is for you. If you appreciate Mass Effect because of its brilliant storytelling and major setpieces or are just looking for a good quality game that doesn't waste your time, skip this one. 

This game might be the pinnacle of Ubisoft game design even though its not from Ubisoft. In my 57 hours of play, I was mostly driving from one place to another, doing fetchquests for NPC's. This might not be an issue if the NPC's were interesting, but they weren't. It feels like the budget was through when it came to bringing characters to life. My major issue with the game is that conversation feels so bland I rather skip through it. Most characters just stare at you while they babble plot exposition at you. For instance: I had to get some cure for the plants of a krogan at a marked location because it was stolen. The plot was thin and this Krogan just spouts out a conversation that I had 50 times before with 50 other NPC's. During the conversation he just stands at his counter, making the same 3 gestures over again. 

If the NPC's in this game were the actors in a movie, they wouldn't even make it on the cast of The Room.

Mass Effect Andromeda tries to do too much and because of that, does nothing well. There are too much cities which feel too lifeless. There are too much NPC's who were given too little attention. There are too much missions which all feel too samey.",1627826256,1627826256,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Characters moment looks and fills slow also is stiff. The running looks weird as the they lean on an angle without moving there spine almost as if they were running straight however on a hill.

The menu is clunky and yo-yo like, what is with having to go to a console to change your layouts. And must press 'space to start mission' however every now and again having to press `esc` to start which is used to go back in menu commands. sometime press numbers to talk other time use the mouse to select option on a wheel.

when you do play mission after all the loading and pressing to skip the same game entry screen gets very boarding.

Yes, i have played Mass Effect 2 & 3, However i did have good hope for this game. This game is more of an explores version of the pass games as i found myself spending my time find things and talk others and when i did final get to shoot something it was short lived with about 1 to 2 mins of battle or 15-30 enemy’s.

This game is a mixed bag.
The visual deatil of visitable planets are sometimes breathtakingly beautiful. The combat system of this episode is easily the best from all Mass Effect games, with much more freedom to thinker with. You can approach targets from multiple angles. Your opponents will also raid and attack you from more surprising positions. This game is also not that riggid in terms of character profiles, you can easily mix tech, biotic and combat skills and fight however you like. This part is very enjoyable.

I've read how bad the game initially was character animations and bug-wise. As a latecomer, I wasn't really noticing this, there were some minor bugs here and there but nothing gamebreaking.

The part where this game falls short is characters and the plot. 

The story is much more linear than the pevious games and it's a remix of the ME1 plot. Even though you have some decisions to make throught the game, it doesn't really affect the main flow in any meaningful way. There's also no more Paragon/Renegade system in this game, and the new ""emote wheel"" is basically variants of the same spoken sentence.

Creating colonies doesn't really reward you with anything. The main villain is as stereotypic as it can get (he's bad and he wants to kill everyone. that's it). The Remnant labyrinths are only interesting for the first couple of times, but then becomes boring.

Most of the sidekick characters are uninteresting and you don't care much about them. Luckily some characters like Drack and Peebee were ok, so I've choosen them as company instead. But playing the other's ""loyalty"" missions is not something you do because you really like to know those characters better.

Ryder is not a veteran soldier like Shepard in the original game, which is probably also a big reason to dislike this game. Not necessarily for me, I think it fits the theme of exploring and colonizing worlds. The character have to fight his inner insecurities at the same time while getting familiar with all he new stuff happening in this new galaxy. The problem is, he's not a strong person and easily gets affected by others, which is bad if you consider that you can't really change how the story plays out.

There's just too much side tasks to complete, most of them are fetch quests which don't give any plus to the story. It's safe to say, you should only play Helius assignments and your allies' tasks. Then the game gets much more enjoyable and you feel like going somewhere storywise.
What really annoyed me were the everlong, unskippable take off and landing animations which makes you think twice before you leave a planet for another.

I've also didn't like how dialogs can play over each other if you rush through the ship, or just go faster in the mission as intended. You can easily skip content which you can't play back without going back to a previous save state.

This is a totally skippable Mass Effect game, which is probably not going to affect the main plot of ME4 in anyway. But it's not as unplayable either as others state. It's not advancing the universe in any important way, but it's still inside the ME universe and for someone like me who got absolultely blown away by the original trilogy, it was a nice extra.",1627244922,1627812750,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want to play more Mass Effect like the trilogy then don't play this game. If you want to play a half-way decent sci-fi game that will surprise you every once in a while then this is probably your game.

Andromeda gets some things right and some things wrong.

SOME of the writing is actually pretty interesting. There are some really cool story points that keep you in the game and make you want to learn more. By the end of it I found myself asking ""but what about...?"" However, for every plot point that got me interested in the game there was one that was just downright boring or uninteresting.

SOME of the characters are interesting. Drack, the Krogan, is one of the more interesting squad mates seeing as how he's essentially a Krogan grandpa. Cora trained for most of her adult life as an Asari and is embedded in the culture and therefore thinks a bit more like an Asari. Other characters, however, are so asinine and boring that I found myself with no desire to speak with them or learn more about them. Character variety is important, but when 2 of the characters are down right unbearable you've got to wonder what the writers were thinking.

The combat was expanded from the trilogy and it works well in some places and others it doesn't. Combos are fun, skills can be exciting, you can switch between classes, and the variety of weapons keeps things interesting. That being said, having to navigate the menus to switch classes and change weapons really puts a damper on the pace of combat. More often than not I found myself on a bullet sponge of an enemy. Nothing really fun about it - just load it up until it dies.

The menus are absolute garbage. Navigating menus embedded in menus gave me such a headache that I ended up using the research and development mechanics as little as possible.

Overall, Mass Effect Andromeda barely squeaks by with a 6/10. It's worth a try if you're a die-hard ME fan, but if you want this to be anywhere near as emotional or interesting as the trilogy it's probably best you stay away.",1627768659,1627768659,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Every Asari NPC has the EXACT SAME FACE
- The premise of the game is to explore a new galaxy, but you encounter the exact same enemies on every single planet. Sure, they might be colored blue on one planet and green on another, but they are the exact same enemies. Also there are people already set up on every planet, so you're not really exploring frontier space. 
- Story relies heavily on hand wavy space magic that never gets explained. The player is just supposed to accept that waving your hand in front of an alien console does exactly what you want it to. 
- Where are the squad controls? If I wanted to bounce around with a jet pack in a wide open area I'd go play Destiny. This is supposed to be Mass Effect. What's the point of leveling up my squad if I can't control what they do in combat?
- Cover system is terrible. I'm actually pretty sure you're not supposed to use cover at all, that's how bad it is. 
- Most people will recommend skipping all side quests and sticking to the main story and loyalty quests in this game. So the advice from a majority of players is, ""Don't engage with 50% of the game, and you'll really enjoy yourself"". And then those same players call this game ""good""... Need I say more?

-The vehicle NOMAD is HORRIBLE.  I got that thing maxed out and could drive like crazy off road bouncing around like crazy, but if you want to drive up a hill ON THE ROAD DESIGNED for traveling you apparently can’t do it.  Absolute trash
-AI 'SAM' is obnoxious.  It will inform you very time you enter or exist different environments - zero ability to make it shut up, unless you mute all conversation which is horrible because your supporting characters have great stories to chat about (there are several complaints @ the EA site since 2017 complaining about this with zero resolution)
-AI 'SAM' will tell you that you can mine material every time your actually start mining.  AGAIN: It will tell you how to mine, WHILE YOU ARE MINING. It actually will not start talking about it until you manually start checking the mining areas yourself
-Very, very bad map structures.  There are planets (Kadara) where you need to zone to one area just so you can zone to a different area and then you have to run OUT of said area so you can finally zone to the specific location you’re aiming to get to
-The landing/launching/galaxy travel displays are rather time consuming and repetitive – it would have been great to have a minutes to just having a short loading screen. 
-Grinding / waste of space – a lot of groups show up and attack.  No value to the story, not a lot of special buildings of value. Just a lot of spawning groups so you can just keep getting xp I guess, but it starts to get really irritating pretty quick
-Poor boss balance – Yay, you leveled up and are about to go against a big boss with a crazy volume of mobs.  The boss is a insanely powerful to a disgusting volume vs. your other reasonably challenging bosses. You're immediately dead, try again.  

I almost completely quit the game but was far in enough that I figured I'd finished it, but I think for most folk it’d probably far more tolerable to just watch some vids and skip the dumb parts.  The crew character interactions was nice but the rest was just horribly done. 

Pretty bummed because the original Mass Effects were amazing and so well done, so it’s disappointing that they went so downhill with this.

Was it worth it?... No. Surely not for cash EA want you to pay.
I got 76 hours of gameplay for which I can safely say that 80%-85% are side mission time. No. I'm not joking, side missions are litteraly overflowing game. If you wanna to just do quickly main story, you can do it easily in one sitting of 8 hours.
That's awful in every sense - game main selling point should be main story, that was trademark of Mass Effect in it's original trilogy. Especially since most of side quests are ""grab this, kill this, talk to this with no option to fail"" etc. - I'll be lying if I wouldn't say at last 20 hours I wasn't dozing off from that kind of copy-pasta quests to fill hole...
Story was fine but there a lot of plotholes about which I won't talk. Gotta play it for yourself but you get what I'm getting at.
Characters - at least on crew side - are rich but are limited by how little interactions we make with them. In some cases though characters are very stiff (especially if we talk about Nexus commanders). It hurts to watch that if they are not some side characters but secondary heroes in story...
Multiplayer - fun for few hours but it's there... to be there. Nothing more, easily avoidable, easily repetitive.
Price is outrageous for content provided - Entire trilogy, even ME3 felt way richer. I expected lessons of ME would sink into Andromeda but game feels like going back to first ME.

And one more thing - after completing main story - game becomes ABSOLUTELY. DEAD.
Seriously other than being ""rewarded"" for 100% habitability, there happens ABSOLUTELY. NOTHING. AFTER.
You left to just do quest pre-finale, sometimes for some unknown reason dialogues from ""past"" appear (like people talking about achievements from far past - which already is inactual). After that? It's over. You can turn off, uninstall honestly...

I love characters introduced in this game and story is okey'ish. I want this game to continue further into next part... but there is need to be work done.

When i first started MEA i treated it like a completely new game (dont take me wrong its definitelly a mass effect game, the unique feeling only the mass effect games have is definitely there), comparing it to the ME trilogy as a whole doesnt make sense. The trilogy being three whole games following one character's journey (Shepard's) had a start a middle and an end, MEA was only the start. 
Andromeda is about laying the groundwork for a new universe its an introduction to the new characters, the new bad guys and the new struggles this galaxy has in store for its new inhabitants. The bad guy Archon as an individual is a bit one dimentional and kinda lame BUT the Kett have a whole a** scary EMPIRE that we didnt see much in this game but by the little information that we see here and there troughout the game they sound as scary as the reapers since they basically send forces across the galaxy to exalt new species to expand the empire.. if written well i'm sure can be good villain matterial in the future.

Our protagonist Ryder is a fresh welcome change since she is very different from Shepard. When we first met Shepard they were already a well trained soldier doing what they are good at, but Ryder wasn't trained to be a Pathfinder, so seeing Ryder go from a self-doubting person to a complete badass in the end, with even more room to evolve as a character in the future makes me look forward for more...actually what makes me look forward for more is also all these intreresting cliffhangers MEA left us with! what happened to the Quarian ark? who is the Benefactor? why was Jien killed? the whole Remnand/Jardaan/Meridian thing?? i smell some very good lore here for future games 😌

Things i really liked in this game:
1. The interaction between the characters while exploring and while on missions. Banter with our companions is pretty much in every bioware game, but in MEA this mechanic seems...perfected. Its very consistent, its fun and makes exploration not boring 
2. The game is gorgeous! The character design is ok the textures only look a little too plastic for me BUT THE WORLDS?? absolutely beautiful! is could easily be a 2020-21 game, its definitelly better looking than some other +++A games out there 
3. Gameplay! very fast paced and fun, hovering with your jetpack was a very good addition  
4. The portrayal of krogan. I liked krogan in the previous games but we mainly saw the krogan as these big battle-thirsty tanks, but in New Tuchanka you'll see more krogan variety  (Vorn and Rorik i love you you big softies)
5. All loyalty missions, finding what happened to the other arks missions and finding Meridian missions: Well made, unique, some were dark, some were funny. 
6. The last mission. Honestly it gave me ME1 final mission war flashbacks, this continuous neverending action from the moment you touch down with your nomad bursting straight while the world around you is a mess and then shooting nonstop waves and waves of kett and remnand bots, while you are without your SAM and your sibling is in danger and archon has taken over Meridian just *chef's kiss*
7. the little connections to the trilogy here and there. one big example is the memory triggers that lead to us learning about the Reaper invasion also liara's audio logs, Alec Ryder's conversation with Garrus's dad, meeting briefly Zaeed Massani's Son, a krogan scientist talking about Okeer and Grunt, and many more.

Things i didnt like / things that are missing:
1. lack of variaty in..well..everything. The asari all look the same except for Peebee, there is no animal variety just different versions of the same animals on each planet etc
2. Some optional side quest are repetitive and some are unnecessarily lengthy because in some cases you have to travel to a bunch of planets to complete them.. good thing they are optional :)
3. While the combat is really fast paced and fun i missed the ""pause and tell your squadmates what power to use mechanic""
4. The first contact with the kett..eh could be better.
 
All in all i'm certain if people gave this game a chance to evolve, a MEA trilogy could easily become as dear to the fans as the og Mass Effect trilogy was.


Below this text is just me ranting about the unfair tretment this game got:
The unnecessary hate this game got is just so unfair, i mean i get it the first few weeks/months were a little rough with the weird animations and everything, but Bioware fixed all that. a lot of judgy gamers didn't really care if Andromeda was a good game or not, they didnt care about all the hard work people did to make this game, all they cared about was meme-ing the h*ll out of this game because it was the trendy thing to do. The sad thing is that they were loud and unfortunatelly..heard.. leading to the conclusion that we pretty much won't get an Adromeda 2 or a DLC. 
Hopefully the next Mass Effect really finds a way to connect the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy and maybe we can continue our journey with Ryder and her crew while we meet again characters from the original trilogy.",1627597439,1627597439,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is the start of a new series, so I think it's pretty unfair to compare it to the original Mass Effect trilogy, especially since it set such a high bar. Then again, I'm playing this game four years after it came out, so it has probably been fixed quite a bit since then.

Is Mass Effect: Andromeda as good as the original Mass Effect Trilogy? No. But is it still a good game, fun to play, and worth buying? Absolutely.

The Good
++ You're no longer restricted to certain skills/powers in prebuilt classes but can instead spend skill points wherever you like to build your own class (and can easily respec by paying credits on your ship, the Tempest). You won't get enough skill points in one playthrough to unlock every rank in every skill (I got to level 75 after doing every side mission, which allowed me to unlock every rank of the 12 passive skills as well as almost every rank in 8 of the 24 active powers), so you do have to think through and decide which skills are best for you. ""Profiles"" are a new addition that give some class-specific bonuses (e.g. soldiers have increased weapon damage and clip size, infiltrators can spot enemies through walls while looking through a scope, engineers have stronger drones, etc.), but you can change these even during combat.
++ This is a great take on ME combat. You have access to three powers at any one time, and each have their own separate power recharge. While this can seem like not much considering the variety of powers in previous Mass Effect games, ""favorites"" are a new addition that let you quickly swap between four preset profile and power combinations (which you can customize whenever you want) mid-combat to deal with situations how you think best. While at first I steered away from using favorites as it seemed like too much to think about in-combat, I began to use them mid-game, and it really keeps combat fresh and allows you to not have to approach combat exactly the same every time. There's a very wide variety of weapons, of which you can hold 2-4 at a time (depending on what skills you take), and the heavier your loadout the slower your power recharge rate (although there are no positives for taking less than a certain weight capacity). Combat is even more fluid than ME3, which is great.
++ The planets that you can explore are quite large, diverse, and fun to explore, especially on the new land vehicle, the Nomad. The settlements on the planets are much smaller than I'd expect and could've definitely been fleshed out more, but the rest of the planets have plenty of landmarks to discover.
++ Countless choices are presented throughout the course of the game, many of which we won't see the consequences until a future installment (if there ever is one), so I can't give much of a negative on them yet. Background NPCs can be overheard remarking on your larger choices, which is a nice touch.
++ Overall the storyline was not bad: try to settle new worlds in a new galaxy, try to make friends with the native good aliens, and fight off the bad aliens. A couple things went a way I didn't expect, which was appreciated. Much is left unanswered by the end of the game, but I assume they will be addressed in future games, so I also can't really give a negative for that.
++ Conversation is often broken down into four personality types (designated by their corresponding symbols), which give more flavor than just nice/dickish and also give more context on how the dialogue will be delivered. Conversations also clearly indicate if a dialogue option will get more background info, advance the conversation, or further your romance with someone, which is all very helpful.
++ The graphics, while not as amazing as some games, are very good. I'm sure you could get countless screenshots of pretty breathtaking views. Facial animations are great in some scenes and pretty lacking in others.

The Neutral
== Your crew in general are pretty interesting. Each feels unique, and I could see myself getting attached to them in future games. And seeing how the crew interact with each other during missions, on the Tempest, and in the Nomad fleshes them out more. In this game, however, your relationships can often feel forced, artificial, and friendly quicker than I'd expect over the course of a series.  I don't think there's anything you can do to lose any of your crew (like Ashley/Kaiden/Wrex in ME1 or the suicide mission in ME2), though, which unfortunately lowers the stakes. In combat I found them to be overall pretty capable, although you can't order them to use specific powers.
== Multiplayer is not completely dead, but there are not that many players on at one time. Overall, it's a very alright experience. It can be a lot of fun with four players, and there's a nice variety of classes, but it can get pretty repetitive with the only three types of enemies and nine maps. 

The Bad
-- Many bugs. Nothing game-breaking, but superficial things like NPCs flying away/sinking into the ground, weird animations, textures not loading properly, etc. So it's not big, but it does give it a bit of an unpolished feel.
-- Some quests require you to find all the things around the map to destroy/scan, which can be tedious, especially if there is no marker.
-- Scanning from your omni-tool overall is very slow and can be annoying if you're anywhere other than inside tight interiors. Scanning planets from the Tempest is very tedious, especially because of the animation to fly to each planet and most of the planets have nothing interesting about them beside perhaps a node of minerals anyway, but thankfully you don't need to do it if you don't want.

OVERALL, it's an very enjoyable game. It took me roughly 120 hours to do pretty much everything. If you want to further explore the Mass Effect universe and go in with an open mind, definitely consider picking it up, especially if it's on sale. 9/10",1627584026,1627584378,True,32,0,0.714901387691497803,4,True,False,False

I don't know if it's different than the console games, if they improved it, or if people were just being picky because it does play a bit differently than the original trilogy.

While I do like this game and think it's a worthy addition to the  franchise, I do have some issues with it:

The facial expressions seem a bit weird and it's not much of an improvement over the other games, which you would think there would be a huge improvement since it's a generation above the original trilogy.
Overall the game feels like it was rushed and that it's unfinished.

I like how you can flirt and romance people outside of your party. I think that's cool. I like the research system, and I love modding. I always love it when you can craft or mod in RPGs it's like my favorite thing in RPGs and MMORPGs.

But overall, I think this is a good game and a good entry into the franchise. Hopefully there will be more. It's also a good jumping in point.

Definitely worth playing and I'm so glad I finally decided to try it. The storyline is good and while there are still some bugs to be found they're easily overlooked compared to everything this game has to offer. Combat is phenomenal and the options in game look and feel advanced. 

[h1]Narrative[/h1]
The story was good and I really took the time to listen and participate in dialogue when able. I truly enjoyed the theme of the game (colonization) and how the mechanics supported it. This provided the perfect breakaway from the original Mass Effect trilogy, though still connected, by giving it the opportunity to develop in its own universe.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The combat system is awesome. It's not as rigid as the original trilogy and profiles (equivalent of classes) and abilities can be swapped on the fly with a short cooldown. Movement is very fluid with sprint and jump jets or biotics to ascend or dash. The vehicle is a blast and goes anywhere. Scenery is gorgeous and immersive. I did experience a couple bugs that required relaunching the game to resolve.

[h1]Achievements[/h1]
They are all straightforward and obtainable. The APEX HQ app is still functional and will help keep your strike teams on missions for the related achievements. However, it is imperative to finish the final strike team mission promotion and recruitment in game in order for the achievement to unlock - doing it through the app will not count.

[h1]Community[/h1]
This game can be played, and achievements earned, entirely solo; but since I do normally like to join a Discord for the games I play I found the best to be Mass Effect Forever.

Picture this, if you will. 

You wake up in a bed that is not your own, in a foreign city whose curiosity towards you is rivaled only by it's refusal to welcome you. The windows are dotted by raindrops and you can practically feel the cool air of the rain from the outside. You sigh as you scroll numbly through your phone. Turns out there is a museum 15 minutes from your hotel. You consider this for a second and decide on a whim, oh what the heck. You dress yourself and make your way through the damp streets. There is the occasional vehicle that passes by, and you feel the gaze of the passengers judging you for walking outside in the rain. ""Another dumb tourist."", you can practically hear the sneer. You brush it off and enter the museum. It's empty, as expected of the early hours. You find yourself stumbling aimlessly into the nearest exhibition room, and your eyes land on a rather humble-looking frame. It's a picture of a landscape, with rolling hills and a dusty looking house in distance. You admire how the colours of the sky blend together in a wistful blue. You look at the artist's name and briefly wonder why they are not considered more famous. You brush that notion aside and enjoy the painting for a little more, finding something comforting in it. And then you move on.

A few weeks go by and you have returned home. You are sitting on the couch scrolling through your selection of movies that feels simultaneously too vast and too limited. A certain movie catches your eye and you sit back, anticipating and hoping for a good time. By the time the credits roll, you find yourself too excited to sleep, the adrenaline pumping in your veins. You think back on a rather humourous scene and chuckle to yourself. That was pretty enjoyable, wasn't it? Natural curiosity encourages you to scour the internet for what others think of it. Did they find it as enjoyable as you? Did they also laugh when the salient protagonist failed miserably at being funny? You eagerly seek out others to share your experience. But the first thing your enthusiasm is greeted with is the sea of scathing complaints. Some reasonable, others downright offensive. It seems as though everyone is fighting to be the one who criticises the movie the most and the most harshly, as if their righteousness is fueled only by being appalled. 

You close the page and wonder meekly to yourself, was I a fool for liking this? Was I stupid for finding that scene funny? Am I lesser of a person for not seeing these so-called flaws? You can't help but subject yourself again to the mocking words of the ""enlightened"", your mind barraged by the seemingly endless hate. Like a victim of hypnosis, you find yourself nodding along, laughing at the criticisms, feeling invigorated by the satisfying feeling of being ""right"". You join in the conversation, attacking the same movie that you a few moments ago found some joy in.

My point being, MEA is different from the original trilogy, and thus, it should be examined as such. As an exploratory game with a mystery at the heart of the story, it is intriguing and compelling. Looking at the combat, it is slick, dynamic, and just downright fun. And in true ME fashion, when it comes to making decisions of the political nature, it challenges you. My only criticism is that I had hope for MORE. More alien races to encounter, more worlds to explore, more side missions, and more mysteries to stumble across. I feel the love that the developers had put into the game, but I also feel the disappointment at things that weren't finished on time.

I actually think this game is not as bad as everyone tries to push. I loved the first 3 games, but they had some major issues too. This game is not perfect, but i enjoyed it greatly. It fixes some issues from the first 3 games but also creates new ones and breaks some parts that were perfect in the originals.

PROS:
- Combat is very fun to play
- Exploring is probably the best part, the outposts are perfect for this universe and story. The nomad is what Mass Effect 1 wanted it to be.
- Side missions. A lot of them are actually good which was not always the case in the original trilogy.
- Visuals, some of the shots and planets look amazing.

CONS:
- Quest markers. Probably the most annoying part of the game. The quest markers are dogshit. They waste your time.
- Story has been done 1000 times in every sci-fi series or film.  Plot holes all over the place. Most of the plot holes get filled when you do all side-missions but a lot still seems rushed. 
- Characters: a lot of interesting characters and great moments but most of them are 1 dimensional and feel very flat. Sadly the main character is probably the dullest of them all.

2) Same ol' Mass Effect combat
3) Lots of Romance options

5) LOTS of side quests

Its not nearly as good as the original trilogy, but is a sort of competent game on its own.  The main story and side quests keep you engaged in the world that Andromeda has created for the most part.  However the same can not be said for the characters.  Most of your squad mates and the surrounding characters in the game feel 1 sided and most of them act childishly.  Mass Effect is a trilogy know for having some of the best characters in gaming, and it is a shame that most of the ones in Andromeda are forgettable.  The facial animations are also somewhat annoying and some times take you out of the game.  With this issues aside, the combat is the best the series has ever seen.  Gun play feels better than ever and with the new skills that they have added, it feels very refined.  The story may not be as strong as that of those in the original trilogy, but is still very engaging, but nothing compared to the original trilogy.  The exploration Andromeda is by far my favorite thing about Andromeda.  Mass Effect 1 is my favorite in the series and one of the reasons is because you are pretty much able to go to any planet and explore.  Andromeda builds on this concept whit tons of planets you can visit.  However unlike its predecessor there is much to do on these knew worlds that look stunning.  While there are many of these world activities, they get boring and feel uninspired after doing so many of them which I felt could have been more flushed out then just simple repetitive tasks that the game assigns you. The graphics in this game for the most part are very good.  While Mass Effect Andromeda may not a great game, but it is definitely not a terrible one.

If MEA had no ties to the mass effect universe (somehow), it would have easily been in the top games for game of the year. But it's part of the mass effect universe so it'll have to deal with living in shepherd's shadow.

Pros: it had amazing combat. I loved how fluid and fast pace it was. I also loved how you can mix and match powers so that I could craft a playstyle that's unique to me instead of being forced into one class. Of course, this results in limiting replayability which I'm fine with frankly. The worlds were beautiful and you actually felt like it was untamed lands with all of the environmental hazards. Unlike the OT, your team were pretty well rounded and 'living'. They moved around the ship, talked with others and etc more than the OT. Of all the team, I only disliked liam (I hate his voice, his character and his hair). Cora was right before him mainly because she feels pretty dry. Other than that I LOVED the squad and are worthy of walking alongside the OT team. The ending was also one of the best in the series. Your actions actually mattered and you saw your actions well, in action at the end. The ending was everything ME3's ending should have been. 

Cons: the first act was a slog. Your character was unsure, looked down upon and etc. Character writing and the setting felt weak as fuck. I also wished Alec Ryder didn't die so soon. Granted, you learn more about him throughout the game so I get what the writers were doing but I feel it could have been handled differently. Lots of people also shit on the Angarans which I agreed with at first but as I continued playing, I overlooked the generic alien design and really enjoyed the other aspects of their culture and tech. 

The Kett are basically the Grineer from Warframe except their character models are monsters from power rangers. Their culture is based off of the roman empire but frankly, since I live in the west, the collector/reaper-like body horror and the roman empire parallels was boring. Only thing I like about the Kett are their fighter star ships. Everything else is ugly as crap.

Speaking of ugly, almost every new piece of equipment from the andromeda galaxy was just ugly. The milky way equipment was good as usual but they really cut back on the armor diversity and weapon diversity. As a biotic, I was stuck with the N7 armor the entire time and while it's sexy, it got boring. 

Also, I did not care for the nomad at all. If I remember correctly, they spent alot of time perfecting it. Yes, it worked fine but for me, it was boring. It didn't even have a gun so the only use it had was carrying you from one place to another. Meanwhile, vehicles in halo helped you and made sequences memorable. Halo 2 bridge when Major Johnson dropped you a scorpion or Halo 3 fighting scarabs with gauss hogs and etc. No weapons means it's a waste of time getting you from one spot to another when they could pull a mass effect 2 and just shuttle drop you into the action.

Honestly, I got my money's worth and I still feel empty from how satisfying the ending was. I wish I didn't join the hate bandwagon and kill the game because it's now forever unfinished. Unless they make an MEA2 which is doubtful because its name is stained and EA isn't going to take risks with millions of dollars.

1]world- great graphics, diverse environments to play in (cold planets,hot planets,high  vegetation planets,asteroids,
              planets with acidic water,space stations)
2]character interaction--lots and lots of people to talk with. would be boring if you are trying to complete all side missions. 
               otherwise ok
3]story---not bad if this is the first mass effect game you are playing. don't go  questioning all logic in the game; they want  
                make the game look ""scientific""; which does not work out well once the player starts thinking about it. i didn't 
                have any problems because i like to play games for  entertainment ,not to be immersed in it. Compared to 
                previous mass effect games,  the story is weak in the sense that it lacks the ""impossible to defeat"" kind of villains
                like the ""reapers"". After all they made the previous games interesting. Main missions have a lot of repetitive tasks
                 like "" activating devices that make a planet suitable for living"". 
                                        Common to all games in the series is the presence of a story of some extinct civilisations and 
                beings (""protheans"" in the first 3 games and ""remnants"" in this game) and we have to use some device made by 
                them to defeat the enemy. When is the hero or his side going to do things on his or their own?  
4)action- better than the previous games: now the hero can jump, in fact there is a jet pack jump. hovering is there: useful 
                against tough unarmed enemies(against enemies with guns it would feel like you are the bull's eye for their target 
                 practice), jet powered dodge is a good change.
5)weapons--throughout the entire series you feel like the ""weapons are puny"". No proper rocket launchers(there are some 
                     launchers in there which you cannot compare with launchers of even older games), may be  the developers 
                    wanted to minimise ""effects"" graphics. Grenade launchers are not that good in ""effects"". You might have heard
                    ""age is just a number"". When we play this game we feel like ""damage is just a number"". Weapons don't have 
                    much diversity in ""effects"". Our vehicle also is a ""non-shooter""; common.. ;out to save a galaxy, to destroy 
                    aliens  with massive space ships and here we are with a ship and a tank both of which cannot shoot

Which is both a good and bad thing, making this a [b]neutral recommendation[/b].


[b][u]I'll try to sum everything up:[/u][/b]
- You play as Scott Ryder -- a pubescent human who likes hanging around in his pajamas when outside of combat zones. I liked Shepard much better.

- Combat is now real-time, without pauses. You can order your wingmen to move or attack (generic) only. The AI is somewhat dumb, your crew deal little damage (so they serve mostly to draw enemy fire), there isn't a great variety of enemies and the vast majority of them has the same behavior.

- Initially, combat can be challenging, with a few particularly difficult and, thus, specially interesting fights. After you reach 25% completion or so, and craft an augmented weapon that suits you, combat is essentially removed from the game. You'll just trample everyone and everything throughout the remaining 75% of the game, which makes it boring (I played it on the second highest difficulty, ""Hardcore""). This nearly completely ruins the game.

- The game's items suck. After you gather enough materials and craft your first weapon (you don't even need to bother crafting a second, higher tier one) and the armor set you want, nothing else you can/will loot in the game is relevant. Don't even bother looting corpses and containers anymore, you won't need [i]any[/i] of it, ever. So ""loot excitment"" in ME:A is non-existent. This ruins the 10% of the game left un-ruined.

- You can research and craft items up to tier X. I finished the game with tier V stuff. It can easily be done with tier I, regardless.

- ME Andromeda's story is fine, but not as good or epic as ME 1-3's. Since combat is virtually removed from the game after a little while and [i]all[/i] the loot is uninteresting and useless, the story is all that's left to keep you playing. And it's not [i]that[/i] good.

- Since combat is way, [i]way[/i] too easy, you start rushing through everything. Or at least that's what happens to [i]me[/i], anyway. That means I skipped over most of the game's text, as I was anxious to find some challenge (which I never did).

- Movement is somewhat clunky. They should have sped up some animations. Also, having to press Ctrl to step over some detail on the floor is annoying. Your character should either be able to walk right over it, or be forced to jump. There's no need for something in between.

- The cover system is very flawed. Sometimes you don't know if you're in cover or not, and when trying to run in the middle of combat, near walls or whatever, you keep getting into cover, and slowing down, against your will.

- Hacking Remnant consoles involves a mini-game somewhat like sudoku (without the math). It's actually cool, but only when it's challenging -- and that only happens [i]once[/i] in the entire game. Not to mention you run into a ""hard"" puzzle at some point in the early game, then into a long, [i]long[/i] series of much easier ones. And, even more often, none at all when hacking consoles. It makes no sense.

- You can romance several characters, and now we have some Witcher-style scenes in there (so keep toddlers away for a few seconds, at some point, when playing).

- Paragon/Whatever system has been removed. Now you have 4 different choices when dealing with dialogues. But, as far as I can tell, it doesn't make any difference which one you choose [more often], except in [i]very few[/i] dialogues with short-term consequences.

- I only remember two major decisions that clearly would/should have important consequences ([spoiler]How to handle the ancient, inescrupulous Angaran AI; and whether to handle Morda the Remnant ship's core or not[/spoiler]). I made the best (read ""most reasonable"") decision on both of them, which led me to: no consequence whatsoever on the first case; and only the obvious, negative consequences on the second (without the expected good ones ever being mentioned anywhere).

- One character that plays a main role in one of the planets you visit ([spoiler]The Charlatan[/spoiler]) simply vanishes after an important confrontation and... you never hear from him again, even though everything suggests you should.

- You can skip most of the travelling animation when going from one planet to the next on the same solar system, but doing so still takes a bit too long. And given that you must do that [i]a lot[/i], it quickly becomes annoying.

- Scanning planets is pointless. After you get enough materials to craft whatever you want to craft, [i]once[/i], there's no reason to bother visiting all solar systems and scanning everything. You will never need the materials you'll find, and you don't even get an achievement for scanning everything. It's a waste of time.

- ME:A has more bugs than you'd expect from an AAA title. The most annoying being your mouse's pointer showing up in the middle of the screen, which happens [i]all the time[/i]. Sometimes the game crashes when closing, sometimes when opening. Once I couldn't interact with a quest character, another time I was travelling at about 120Km/h (that's what shows on the screen, although you're actually going at about 30Km/h), abruptly stopped for no reason, and couldn't leave the Nomad nor do anything else. Twice my mouse simply stopped working inside the game. There are more, but the most important thing is: none of them were game-breaking.

- You'll run into a lot of copy-pasted assets. Once again, more than you'd expect to see in an AAA title.

- You must install and register on Origin to play. When you run the game, Origin's icon shows up on the corner of your taskbar and... that's it. It doesn't bother you any further, and it closes itself when you exit the game. Still, having to install and register in a third-party platform sucks.

- All the secondary stuff in the game (voice acting, soundtrack, cutscenes, etc.) is well done. I think it's a shame, though, that big studios always prioritize this stuff instead of the [much cheaper] time and thought required to make the game actually [i]good[/i], or at least balanced. They should [i]really[/i] hire people who [i]like[/i] and [i]play[/i] games to design them. As it's often the case with AAA titles these days, ME:A feels like 75% movie, 25% game.

- The game is heavier than it should be. It feels somewhat poorly optimized, but I have a feeling the engine it uses is the one to blame.


[u][b]Four things got me excited in ME:A:[/b][/u]
1/2 - Two difficult fights in the early game, before I managed to craft my stuff ([spoiler] clearing the first Kett base and fighting the first Architect[/spoiler]);

3 - The [i]one[/i] challenging ""sudoku-like"" puzzle;

4 - Some of the dramatic action (mostly cutscenes) that preceeded the last boss-fight.


[u][b]In short, here's why this is a neutral recommendation:[/b][/u]
This could be copy-pasted into a review of many games out there, but the truth still is: major studios invest many millions of dollars into 3D modelling, textures, writting, body/voice acting and marketing, and barely anything on devising the actual gameplay and the aspects of it that make a game [i]fun[/i].It pains me to see so much effort from those who did their part well (again, 3D modelling, writting, etc.) end up becoming part of a game that is ""meh,"" again, again and again, because someone who should didn't put enough thought into what they are paid [a lot] to do, or because some greedy billionaire, who has no idea what a game actually is, wants to increase his fortune by sheer marketing/hype (over a game that doesn't fulfill its true purpose because it has been given a new one: to make money, and nothing else).

Is ME:A a bad game? No. Is it a good one? No.

I also liked that they got rid of the paragon vs renegade system and opened up Ryder for a lot more character role play.

On the whole, the gunplay rarely gets boring and, if it does, the crafting system allows players to create some rather innovative combinations. And, if you get bored playing one character type, you can refresh your skills on the cheap to play a different style. 

There are some cons. The loading time between systems and planets is a bit of a drag. Some of the side-quests are a grind to complete.

1238000,96099131,76561198821325591,0,42,10152,0,10128,1628761197,"This review will be for those who are still on the fence about whether to give this one a shot after the original trilogy. No spoilers, but it will be lengthy.

Just like many I wasn't sure I'd even care about anything that could happen here and it took me 4 years to give it a shot. Now, after 2 play-throughs and 100% completion I think I compiled my thoughts. I'd break them down into ""pros"", ""cons"" and ""tastesies"". I'll start with the latter:

TASTESIES:
1. Gameplay. Gotta say, it took the studio some quads to render a full-on fresh start. Andromeda is VERY different from the original ME trilogy when it comes to the core - it is not as much about a story as it is about exploration, politics, strategy and development. It is a very different experience and a very ambitious one... which I'll bring up by the end.
2. Characters. Everybody loves Shepard and Garrus and whatnot, but they had time to grow on everybody. This game offers a MASSIVE amount of characters who all have things to say, story to them (pretty inherent to the synopsis). Getting used to all-new faces might be hard, but they could grow on you fast - thankfully, all characters are pretty unique in their own way.
3. Freedom. ME: Andromeda might be one of the games where you can (or may need to) do too much. There is direction through the story, of course, but the amount of things that can be done outside the story is baffling. 

PROS: 
1. Wonder and intrigue. Sure, discovering more about Protheans was a lot of fun in ME, but Andromeda too has a lot of real exploration to offer and, dare I say it, it is a true focus of the game. Some things could become formulaic down the line, sure, but you can never shake off the feeling that you're just on the verge of learning more - hits you right. 
2. Character customization. Aside from the fact that your character's personality basically gets established throughout the game (I'm not talking role-play, I'm talking about the way the character interacts) Andromeda offers an interesting levelling and crafting system that allows you to develop in any direction you want... or in all of them. Not gonna add anything more.
3. Consequences of your actions... if Andromeda 2 ever happens. There's a lot of stuff you can impact, however, a lot of it clearly is to be played out later.
Optional: Multiplayer's pretty fun and non-commital.

I know you were waiting for this: CONS.
1. Bugs. There are quite a few things that are still are unpatched (and officially, probably, will never be) and while some do not affect the game much (glitching dialogues) some can be very annoying (a few lagging achievements one of which can't be done on PC because the functionality for it doesn't exist unless you have a controller). 
2. Some dumb story points. There are quite a few occasions when you can hear stuff referenced that hasn't happened yet or in the main story your characters seem surprised by something you occasionally discovered on your own earlier. Or characters just being dumb in a couple of situations.

And now it's time to mention something that is both this game's biggest advantage and downfall: AMBITION.
Everything about this game screams that it was supposed to be the begginning of a saga that could rival anything else in complexity and world-building, down to building cities and manually changing fences in the streets. All the cliff-hangers, broken story points, sloppy level-making at times and some tedious quests scream that this game should've been worked on for 5 years at least and the studio barely gave it two. Unless this game is continued, which it could be by the looks of that recent ME teaser, it could forever stand as a monument to how not to bite less than you can chew. Until it continues, the idea of this game will ALWAYS be better than the game.

Since it wasn't a perfect game at launch, the complaints just continued to grow. Eventually Bioware was neutered and decided to cancel any future DLC that they had planned and, to be frank, was clearly needed to conclude several plot threads still open at the end of the game. Had they worked at it, this could have been a come back hit, but no. The fucking cowards gave up. I blame Bioware, and every whiny bitch who doesn't understand how hard a game is to make.

The only way I can make sense of this game is if I consider the possibility that Electronic Arts are going through some form of psychological break down.  Characters are uninteresting empty vessels.  Hostile faction that possesses a level of respectability LOWER than CNN (you think i'm joking?).
 
The setup is absolutely fine, Depart on a freezer ship into another galaxy to explore and colonise.  Upon arrival the situation turns desperate. 7/10.  Perfectly acceptable platform to build upon.  Problem for me is that EA decided to go into a mode of total incompetence from that point on.

If there is a mod to fix the load time on a Kadara door, it should be apparent that Bioware never bothered to try and fix the problems with this game. The grind is probably the worst part of this game as they want you to build blueprints and gather a massive amount of materials to even research them. It is a fucked system that extends the game time of this game to around 80+ instead of most likely a 30-40 hour game if you like completing games. Honestly this game with mods is quite fun and can be a fun revisit when all the grinding has been removed from the game. It is what I did after 5 hours of tedious gameplay and it made my gaming experience much more enjoyable. 2/5

Mass Effect: Andromeda can be judged as a flawed Mass Effect game or as a decent sci-fi game with Mass effect skins based on exploration and discovery.

I think the worst part of the game for me was traveling in your ship, it just felt slow and boring. There's no more flying around in the ship like in the previous games. But I guess if you're alright with not exploring every system and scanning every planet, it's not going to be an issue for you. I did scan every planet, for the hell of doing it at least once. Going from planet to planet you can skip the cut scenes, but not from system to system which I felt was weird. I really would have loved to be able to skip the landing/takeoff since you see them so often. But those were really the only things I really disliked about the game.

The combat is a lot of fun, but less tactical than the previous games. Can't choose when to use your squad's abilities or choose what weapons they use, but I didn't mind it that much.

Knowing all of the issues that it had, I was prepared to play the game purely out of curiosity at how the Devs continued their highly praised series. 

Getting it on sale has helped me be okay with most of what happens in the game and I only recommend it as a sale purchase. Paying full price for this would not be ideal if you're someone looking for another Mass Effect experience, because this honestly isn't a very good Mass Effect game. It uses lore, tech, and species from the original and makes some callbacks that might spark your attention if you've played all the way through it, but at the heart of things it is more of your standard open world, cover-based shooter RPG than a uniquely Mass Effect experience.

First, I'll give credit where it's due:

- The graphics are good and I love seeing the detail on characters' faces when I'm talking to them up close.
- Planets are now open world and you can jump, meaning a lot more nooks and crannies to explore.
- Conversation wheels now have icons that tell you what sort of attitude your character will have while saying certain things, or if some things might push along the conversation or just ask probing questions. I really love this feature the most.
- The Galaxy map is very pretty and easy to use. In a way it's first person but as simple as it was to use in ME3 (without the Reapers chasing you around).
- You can scan things with your Omni Tool for more information. As someone who likes poking at stuff and exploring, this is definitely a nice addition for me.

Despite these good changes to the gameplay, there are far too many changes to the Mass Effect formula to make it a true ME game:

- The open world nature of the planets means you spend far too much time on a single planet instead of moving around multiple ones like in the trilogy.
- They removed the Paragon/Renegade system so your morality is no longer in question and nothing you say or do really matters in the long run, discarding any replay value.
- Because you'll spend so much time running around a single planet, you'll be engaged in far more combat than opportunities for dialogue and choices. It makes for a very repetitious and unsatisfying experience.
- You can't equip armor or weapons on your crewmates. Period. At least in ME2/3 you could still change their outfits as well as give them different weapons. There's none of that in Andromeda and it just irritates me that I keep getting duplicate gear when I loot enemies.

On top of that, there are many elements to the gameplay and story that make it hard to feel invested:

- The main character is no stranger to combat and difficult situations, yet her personality makes her come off as a child who's been put in command of an empire. (To be fair I've only played the female one but it's more than likely the same for the male.) She has no real growth story arc which makes her a far less confident and likeable protagonist than Shepard.
- The Kett, who are the main alien antagonists in this game, are very unoriginal. I'm just gonna go ahead and spoil this for you: They are brainwashing people and turning them into additional Kett, just like the Reapers were indoctrinating and transforming people back in the Milky Way. It's lazy and they could have done without them in my humble opinion.
- Weapon/Armor crafting has been added but it seems wholly unnecessary since you get equipment from drops and stores. I would ignore this part of the game but it likes to remind me that I have research points to spend on things I don't need.
- The entire Asari race has not been well crafted in Andromeda. Aside from Peebee, one of two Asari on your crew, they all have the exact same facial features. Asari in the original trilogy showed not just unique faces but also tattoos.
- An embarassing amount of mobility bugs still exist in this game to this day. I've seen security guards copping a squat instead of standing upright; NPCs with their feet sinking in the floor; others ""teleporting"" from Point A to Point B intead of walking... The list goes on. So far my game has only crashed on me once but I am still disappointed at the amount of issues I've run into in this one game in comparison to the trilogy.

I could go on but I think I've given more than enough reason why I hesitate to recommend this game. If there was a ""Meh"" button instead of just thumb's up or down, I'd use that one to cast my vote. If you really like cover-based shooters with combat at every turn, this isn't a bad game at all. They even have a multiplayer mode you can get into with others. But, if you have come here looking to continue your Mass Effect experience, I'm afraid you will be sorely disappointed.",1626635738,1626635738,False,1,0,0.521072804927825928,0,True,False,False

I'm not giving its narrative or characters a fair shake, I'm skipping/skimming a lot of dialogue because it just has no interest to me, so take all of those complaints with huge salt grains.
The character models look bad. Like worse than ME2/3 maybe even worse than 1, I don't know what they did, whether its lighting or an attempted redesign, but they just look inferior.
The gameplay is quite fun, I like driving the Nomad around, shooting stuff is good, powers are good, the open world works against it because there's no ability to level design in an open world, I can come from anywhere, so that's not great.
There's a lot of little flaws like animations that just HAVE to play and I don't care about the leaving system animation it doesn't look cool. Or the landing animation. I think that was an issue in previous ME's though.
The characters and the narrative aren't very interesting, as I prefaced, grain of salt. But so far, it feels depthless. Here's an evil group of aliens, here's a good group. You're colonists in a new galaxy (effectively invaders) but you're the good guys, and you're actions are only good, and theirs are only bad. Not defensive, evil.
We should probably ignore that, and the fact that in ME they didn't open any new Mass Relay's but going to another galaxy? Fuck it, fine.
It also starts with space magic which kinda sucks, I'd rather we get to the space magic later rather than immediately. Oh yeah and in 14 months the entire mission fell apart and multiple fractioned nations rose up. It's kinda stupid.
There are bugs, far more than there should be. I've clipped through the world, had objectives just fail to show or fail to update or fail to be interactable, had the nomad port back to base when I've driven like 200m's away kicking me out on the dirt. It's not good, especially given the amount of time this game has had out, for it to still have such persistent issues.

The game play is generally very good (except for the fact that you can't direct your squads power usage). The profiles are a neat idea as they don't force you into a specific class for the entire game. Also I like the general overhaul of the way conversations work, with choosing a tone, rather than choosing between a binary Good/Evil response. The premise of the story (exploring an unknown galaxy) is also interesting and is set up rather well in the early hours of the campaign.

HOWEVER, the story (so far) is just complete trash. There is zero setup for any of the story beats and no emotional connection with any of the characters. Remember how in past ME titles you would meet a new crew member and have a story quest with them that showed you what type of a character they are? Yeah, that's all gone. Now you get a forced scene where you meet the new crew member and in the next scene they essentially force themselves onto your ship. You have no say in this.

All the characters are bland, with barely an interesting quality between all of them. The asari character PeeBee pretty much made me want to quit the game the moment I met her. I have never seen a less likeable character in a video game (or at least one that wasn't intended to be unlikable). Character interactions in my 11 hours of playing have also been very bland. An interesting titbit about the characters is that everyone keeps mentioning how this is something new and exciting, which gives off the vibe that the original trilogy should be considered ""old hat"".

With the story so far, you just get pushed from one goal to another with barely and explanation to why you are doing any of it. Slight spoilers, but I gave up on the game when I met the Angara. I have never seen a lazier introduction to a completely alien race in all my years of playing video games. Not only do all of them magically speak English, they also claim not to trust you, but then instantly let you leave to explore a WORLD ALTERING, TERRAFORMING VAULT. They even tell you where it is and give you a guide (another crew member that forces themselves onto the ship).

Side missions so far have mostly been boring fetch quests. The R&D part sounds interesting as a concept, but in practice it just bogs everything down. Starting up colonies on planets and raising their viability is also interesting in concept, but is relegated to mostly boring fetch-quest-tier side missions. 

Not to mention all of the bugs. NPC-s teleport on a regular basis, guards on the Nexus take cover as if in a fire fight while standing guard at a door, animations bug out and leave NPC-s stuck in strange loops, NPC-s fade through objects and facial animations still break after all the patches. 

I bought the game on sale, having heard that it has gotten a lot better and that it's not such a bad game to begin with. To a degree I agree, the game isn't necessarily awful, but it commits the worst sin a video game can commit: it's boring and mediocre.

get it if..

-sale for less than $10 (which it frequently does) as I did.
- You know nothing about mass effect or take it as a ""mass effect inspired project"" as its nothing like the original trilogy but its own interpretation of the already built lore. Expecting something similar will dissapont you.
-you dont mind a complex combat system as it leads to fast battles and flexible playstyle with resource/crafting components that can be overwhelming at first but rewarding taken the time.
-do not mind numerous fetch quests and repetitive gameplay if it means traveling beautiful landscapes or just exploring sci fi worlds (there only roughly 6 destinct worlds however).
-are okay with mechanics to lengthen gameplay by making players wait for certain events before they can finish a quest or long load times planet to planet.
-you are okay with a very flawed protagonist that is very out of their element and nothing like your usual confident type, more of stumbling to get things right.
-the idea of seeing your team organically interact with one and another is an interest to you, even if your personal dialogues you have with the crew is not as well as it could be like in the original trilogy.
-you are okay with dialogue options not meaning anything other than the conversation tone and roleplay of your character.
-you are fine with still some bugs being present, long as most of the game breaking ones are removed and it is in a playable state.





the long answer...

first of all, I bought this game under $10 and my review will be the assumption you do the same as it is regularly on sale. You shouldn't buy at full price for this one regardless, plenty of falls and only for die hard mass effect fans that are open to something different or like open world sci fi games even if it being very repetitive. I did not play this game during its mess of a launch, but I am in fact a die hard fan of the original mass effect trilogy and is the reason I waited so long since heard it ""killed the mass effect series"", even with its cheap price you will have many mix emotions right off the bat as this is not the mass effect you know, in every way except its fundamental lore it has completely changed and sooner you accept that the better. I will be honest I was not enjoying the first 10 hours because it felt less than what it should of been, lacking in everything what made the original trilogy what it was...then I landed on the first planet where you are free to explore in any direction and I got what this game was and knew it could never be the focused story of the original trilogy. If the original trilogy was an epic space opera about stopping cosmic horrors, this one is about the slow and explorative nature of traversing the unknown to transition from being lost to be home. Slowly taking harsh and hostile environments to conqured lands and safe havens, you dont rush this one and take your time on it.

However, the open world quickly felt very...empty and boring to me after doing similar tasks world to world but that was until I had my second revelation with the combat system. If you play this like the original mass effect trilogy or any cover shooter (hiding under cover and shooting from afar)...the gameplay will get dull quick as combat is everywhere and just hiding under cover makes it feel long and slow, this is because its not meant to be played that way. The combat here is designed for quick vertical and lateral movement where you should be designing your own classes from scratch, choosing skills to best suit your prefered playstyle and literally being able to switch customized classes during gameplay on the fly. I ended up making a solder type with being able to lay down grenades and mines while sniping for maximum damage from a far and then instantly switch to a biotic type (pretty much a jedi wizard) for close range telaporting enemy to enemy with a shotgun and force pushing them to walls while also making black holes at close range...its honestly the most fun combat in the series. However, I didnt fully understand its mechanics until maybe the 20hr mark, the game does an awful job teaching you how to navigate its long and messy menus for skills/classes/crafting/etc...but when you learn it, extremely rewarding.

The story is very simple, very obvious bad guy and nothing like the original trilogy. its narrative is a means to give reason for its setting and gameplay, for a lot itll be the main dissapointment BUT it does two things better than the entire original trilogy...how your character's dialogues work and how your crew talks to each other. In the original series you played as either paragon (all good) or renegade (all bad), you were really locked into those roles to get the most out of your experience but also made the player feel restricted when interacting with the world. Here you dont really make an impact in your choices but your repliws fall into 4 tones which being emotional, logical, professional, and casual which although might not lead to new outcomes really makes you feel you are playing as how YOU want to play at all times, you can mix and match as much as you like to build relationships how you want to build. More impact on decisions would be appreciated but is a nice step to a better direction. You also get to choose when and not to specifically flirt with someone, which in the original trilogy was a problem as just being nice sometimes came out as flirty when you didnt mean to be. The other thing is your crew organically interacts with each other, you will see them all the time walking around the ship dynamically interacting with one and another and on missions will always talk to each other to pass the long drives you have to do on the planet's surface. the original trilogy had much better dialogue when you yourself talked to your crew directly but then spent most of the time hanging out in the same place maybe...rarely walked around and interacted with one and another, here they do it all the time which gives a better sense of community for the series.

This game still has bugs and lacking in a lot of areas which is why even if I recommend it, wait for a sale. its far from perfect and even though being in development hell it still has its moments like the free roaming in exotic worlds, fresh gameplay for the series, more organic dialogue options, and more random conversations among npc crew mates. its a game that takes time to see it for what it really is, but if you can it can be an enjoyable time.",1626511219,1626511219,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Powers and weapons feel punchy and quick, the fluid class/profile system allows for newfound diversity and experimentation, and you'll be continually stunned by the gorgeous vistas and landscapes each world has to offer. Additionally, the cinematics are some of the best in the series, putting an ""!"" on intense story moments. 

As for exploration, I personally enjoyed the more open-world approach, where you consistently had access to the Mako's cousin -- the Nomad. Having distinct worlds that you could regularly visit created a sense of connectedness among levels. However, this comes at the cost of the fine-tuned details present in previous entries.

[i]Andromeda[/i] gets-by with its quest writing, consistently offering enjoyable (yet not stellar) story experiences. That being said, there are a few moments in the main story that truly awe-inspiring or get the blood pumping. The crew, like the game as a whole, is also a mixed bag. Some characters ([spoiler]Peebee, Jaal, Kallo, and Vetra[/spoiler]) I loved, others ([spoiler]Drack, Lexi, and Suvi[/spoiler]) are okay but not great, and a few ([spoiler]Cora, Gil, and Liam[/spoiler]) felt boring overall.

The game's biggest pitfall is the same as what the ME trilogy is known for -- choice and consequence. While there were plenty of decisions that felt nuanced, ones where I'd go back and forth trying to figure out what was ""right"", the lack of follow-up made the decisions lose some weight in retrospect. In the moment, this isn't something that is apparent to the player. The decision is made, the quest is completed, and the player moves on. But when compared to player expectations, largely because of how the original trilogy handles this, it becomes increasingly noticeable when your decisions aren't mentioned later on or have a domino effect that changes future quests or decisions.

All in all, if you're a fan of the original trilogy, I'd still recommend this one. That being said, it's important that you don't treat it as ""Mass Effect 4"" -- because that's not what it is. Instead, simply enjoy your time in the fantastic Mass Effect universe once again and soak in everything it has to offer.",1626313893,1626313893,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

For starters, the load ins on missions fail about 5% of the time. It does not sound like much but, as you swap locations and load into landing zones so many times it becomes a pain in the butt. The other major issue I have seen is when achievements pop up it will sometimes change the game to a windowed mode when the setting in game is set to full screen. 

The other little issues I have seen are not as disruptive as the first couple I have mentioned. There are graphics glitches, the Companions warp around, enemies spawn strangely and so on. The game acts oddly sometimes.

At the end of it, this game has been out for a good amount of time. If EA or Bioware really cared about making games work and making for an enjoyable user play through, these issues would have been fixed long ago. 

If they are just lazy that is one thing. If they are just inept that is one thing. If they made their money and moved on that is one thing. the fact that it is all 3 lets you know what to expect from games they make. Like I said before this is at best a $10 game.

Get it cheap so the problems are still small.

Edit, this game gets worse when it comes to map markers and movement flow. Some of the map areas were made lazy. instead of being able to move over open ground they made the later zones road only accessible, high mountains or hazard blocked. this is a trick that a lazy developer will use to avoid having to make a complete map. while you can just stay on the roads it gets annoying not being able to just go to your map marker. I almost regret spending 10 on it as it really should just be a free game as bio and ea will never fix the problems. hell ea is still selling titianfall and that game cannot be played at all.",1626034144,1626311324,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And while I was among the crowd who didn't like the ending of ME3, I get it- Shepard's story is complete.  It has a definitive end.  But the Mass Effect universe?  The world, and all the characters there-in... the surface has barely been scratched.

While I understand the frustration with this game, for what it is I absolutely enjoy it.  At 100 hours... that was from only 1 play through.  I just beat the original trilogy during my play through of Legendary Edition.  And now, I'm firing up Andromeda for hopefully another 100 hours.  

It's July, and my hope was that by the time I got done playing through the original trilogy again, and this, maybe we'd have some more news on the next Mass Effect game.  I now doubt that, mostly cause I'm just burning through the games too quickly.  But also because we likely won't hear anything till the end of this year at the earliest, probably some time next year to be more realistic.

So till then, I'll enjoy Andromeda as much as I can.  And then afterwards continue to hope for the best with whatever the next installment in this great universe ends up bringing.  

Review of this game?  If you enjoy Mass Effect at all, this is a definite Mass Effect game.  Through and through.  Is it perfect?  Is it of the same caliber as the original trilogy?  Nope.  But it's also not the original trilogy.  It is a game in the Mass Effect world, but apart from the original trilogy.  It's more of the same- great new characters with interesting story arcs, awesome adventures, many great relationships (friends and foes) along the way.  All around it is a great time and worth the play through.

But thanks to some rushed decisions during development, it is also lacking.  There are odd bugs, some game breaking.  There are odd decisions that are evident as you play through.  And largely- there are promises that were not fulfilled. 

What's done is done though and this is what we have.  Would I tell you to go out, 4 years after its release, and drop $60 on this game?  Nope.  Not worth it.  $30?  That's a bit better.  If you have to opportunity to 
pick this up for a reasonable price- do so.  I don't think you'll regret it.

To clarify - I am a huge fan of Bioware-style RPGs in all their iterations, and I absolutely loved Dragone Age: Inquisition, so take this with a grain of salt that I am fine with random grind.

PROS:
- THE TIES TO THE MAIN SERIES (to me they were very satisfying, but you could probably just read them or watch them on youtube). I wish we could see more.
- Gunplay is better than previous games
- Open worlds aren't too bad
- Graphics are okay
- Some companions are interesting

CONS:
- Mediocre writing
- Below mediocre cutscenes direction
- Some companions are utter trash
- Animations are still funky
- Almost no music, hence most ""epic"" moments fall flat
- Who the f though it was a good idea to have so much unskippable transitions! Mod them out
- Game is still buggy to some degree, sometimes you can't interact with an NPC, sometimes it crashes. Not a dealbreaker, autosaves worked for me in 100% cases.
- No tangible rewards for exploration in a game about exploration. Not even an achievement. Yikes
- REQUIRED MODDING to deal with most issues - i.e. powerup your vehicle, mod out the transition cutscenes, speed up the doors, etc.

CONCLUSION:
This game is a massive timewaster (which can be trimmed down to some extent) and can be compared to some AA-titles. It's nowhere close a AAA-RPG game, but it will do if you like this sort of timesinks. Game had potential. It's not great, not terrible. And not 3.6 roentgen-style.

Buy with a discount. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.

First Impressions:
I always felt a lot of hate from the media towards this game so I never gave it a shot coming out of the box. However playing it now, makes me wish I had done so a long time ago. At first I got this mysterious feeling about the game, like a great sense of immersion. I hardly get this feeling from games. I felt like I was sort of alone, an alien in an alien world to me. Being somewhere new and undiscovered. A definite Star Trek and Metroid vibe, if one put two and two together. As time progresses, you become something much larger than yourself. I definitely feel part of a team and that my decisions are important to others around me.

Here are some Pros:
Very lengthy and slower based singleplayer story telling, story decision making, awesome fluid and diverse combat with loads of playstyles, elements of mystery and sci-fy. The game is downright gorgeous and with my powerful setup and cranking up the graphics, its beautiful. Mods can increase this further even. 

Here are some Cons:
Facial expressions, though significantly better than launch, are still not great. Mods can help with that. Later on in the game, I experience an occasional crashes during the game, seems to occur during autosaves. Some of the quests can get tedious if you are a completionist like me and shoot for 100% completion.

Conclusion: Id honestly score this game a 9 out of 10 :) and I feel everyone should give this game a shot. Though it might not be for everyone, there is a lot of fun to be had.

I'm not going to spoil anything so, here's a quick summary. You are a Pathfinder, you're job is to find a suitable planet to call ''home'', so you need to explore the galaxy, to search for your new home. In your journey you will find people, they could be your allies or your enemies depending on your choice. Some decisions could make a minor impact, some could have a major impact to your journey.

ME: Andromeda isn't really as bad as people say, it's actually pretty fun. Diverse Class system, Biotic Combos, Tech Combos, Combat Combos, etc., the combat system is amazing, because you can face the enemy in different ways, wether it be Gathering your enemies in the middle with your singularity then blowing them up with a grenade, or sneak behind them with stealth cloak and shoot them in the back of their head with massive damage. Though i must say the exploration gets a bit ''dull''.

Why dull? because the world just feels... empty. There are lots of Star Systems but no exploration, just anomalies (what the fuck is even that?). As in Planets are there but you can't explore them, all you can do is deploy probe gather intel and done.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

The game is painful to play and I am struggling to finish my first playthgrough. It starts of good and strong and for the first few hours you wonder ""Maybe the reviews on launch were wrong."" And they it starts going down hill. 
-The entire quest tracking system is a mess. You can find and complete questes before they're supposed to, creating massive timeline plotholes, characters forget information or act like however they want with complete disregard for your actions.
-Dialogue is a massive downgrade from the OT. 
-The animations are...nediocre but after the patches manageable and ignorable.
-Combat is actually fun...and I agree...in some points it is the best of the series, Hoewver it is extremely neitered by at the same time giving you the most custumization of the entire series(which makes the class system meaningless.) And then restricting you to 3 powers....which results in mostly unlocking the passives and just going soldier and shooting everything. 
-After a while you realize combat is meaningless and will skip every encounter unless it's required for a missions.
-Amazing beautiful maps, the best in the franchise...until you realize 85% of the quests just send you across an overall empty map on a wanabee mako and then back and then to another corner and then back. And...it's basically 90% fetch quests and backtracking and missions become a pian and you'll wish the linear maps of the OT were back.
-Plothole, plothole, plothole.

It is not a terrible game...it is just [b]PAINFULLLY AVERAGE[/b]...specially when compared to the OT. If you have never played ME before..this game is probably a 6-7/10 and a good entry into the franchise.

If you have played any ME gae before you will realize how painfully average the game is compared to the OT and...it's just...painfully a 4/10 at most. It keeps getting worse and worse. 

I've placed over 200 hours into Legendary Edition during it's release month. I have struggled to get 60 hours into this game in a month because dumb things just keep making me want to stop playing for a while because my brain gets numb.

The only thing ""Mass Effect"" about this game are the aestetics. The biotics can be passable as generic 'space magic,' but without being able to control your squad's abilities it lacks the tactical combo mechanics from the rest of the franchise.

...and then there's the unlikable characters and cardboard writing. Good God, how I miss being Renegade. I would leave my entire squad to die if I could. I felt dirty going for the Romance achievement, even with Cora (who is obsessed with asari like a weebo is about Japanese culture), who was the least awful of the options. And Ryder, both male and female, have the weakest and most safe dialogues in the game. Its like they're afraid to step on anybody's toes least they break a foot. The humor is dad-joke level with Scott Ryder, but with Sarah Ryder you want to break your headphones -- the girl can't deliver a punch line without causing everyone in the room to die from maximum cringe!

The ONLY saving grace of this game is the combat and MAYBE the open world aspect, but if you're looking for that go buy another game. Or better yet, replay the original trilogy and hope that ME4 isn't a disaster like Andromeda.",1625976170,1625976170,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1238000,95512822,76561198803089380,0,79,4698,0,1379,1626668167,"So I got this on the Xbox when it launched and it was fraught with ugliness that was evident in just the first 30 or so minutes so I abandoned it.  Following the release of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition I picked this up on sale for the PC.  I have to say a lot of the ugliness has been ironed out (there are still some odd things like how the menu's flash the screen every time you go in and out of them) and I am so far finding the game to be much bigger than I expected and kind of an interesting pull from the Mass Effect Universe without being a ""Shepard"" game.

So for starters I actually only consider this a Mass Effect game in name.  Since it has really nothing to do with the Galaxy the original trilogy took place in it's really just a far removed story borrowing elements from the original trilogy.  I mean so much of it is out of place without the Mass Relays to travel with and other inconsistencies.  If you can push past the somewhat ham-fisted effort to make it a ""Mass Effect Sequel without being an actual sequel"" there is a lot to like.  I mean a lot of your call backs are there but everything is just much more deep,  Everything from the ""Class"" you play as to the weapons you use (which can be crafted, re-crafted, upgraded, modified, and changed) has more depth to it.  Some of that depth may come off as unwelcome (having to craft and re-craft armor/weapons over and over again as you level up is annoying) but a lot of it makes the game that much more fun to experiment with.  Honestly I will say I am going to be cheating like crazy on a subsequent play through because there just is so much that I am blocked from doing due to a lack of desire to want to farm/grind like crazy to get skills and items I want to try out.

Pros:
-Solid graphics.  Its definitely got the polish.  And I have not had a goofy eye effect even once.
-Fast action packed combat.  It reminds me a bit of games like The Witcher or Dark Souls with the openness of the combat.  being able to jump and hover in a ""Mass Effect"" game is also cool along with the crazy dodge button.
-Lots of content.  I am 22 hours in and just finished the first ""Introductory"" planet.  Which is actually still gated like 70% of the way due to ""environmental hazards"".

Cons:
-Back and forth, back and forth.  There is a lot of going here, going there, going here, then going there again.  I mean it is a hallmark of games to have a ""Hub"", but it seems everywhere you go becomes a hub and then gets blocked off until you advance a bit somewhere else and then you have to come back and unlock more.
-Farming/Grinding.  Have to say the sheer amount of gathering you have to do to unlock crafting recipes is a bit jarring.  It is more like a crafting system you find in an MMO like Final Fantasy 14 or Warcraft sometimes.",1625975831,1625975897,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Its so bad I can only use 3 skills at a time. This makes fighting repetitive and also makes using skill points feel completely comical.
Not enough guns, literally using the same OP gun I found 20hrs ago.
Landing on planets are the same: Talk to main NPC(They hate you of course), activate 3 shrines, activate main shrine, create outpost.
The terrible loading screens when traveling between planets in the solar system. Stop with the camera switches ffs!

Head explosions

The good.
The characters are well enough made with their own personalities to make you love them. Some are better made than the others.
Going around the planets and discovering different things and environment really helped with the theme of the game being exploring the unknown.
The story was enjoyable, but it was the cliche bad guy wants to destroy the galaxy.

The bad.
Animations. Good god, the animations are a bad joke. I think the whole animation department was filled with interns that had 1-3 months on the job.
Dialogue was weak, could have been way better. At times the 'options' you had were all bad and not even one good choice from them.
The loooonnnng animations switching between planets. Can't even imagine playing this at launch when those were not skippable, but still annoying how it zooms in on a planet then zooms out.

In conclusion i'm happy this game failed + the anthem fail just so they could do the trilogy legendary edition and ME4 when it comes out. It was enjoyable to play just for the mass effect feel that you get from exploring unknown planets. Worth getting at a 75% off.",1625858971,1625858971,True,5,0,0.598540186882019043,0,True,False,False

allot of content creators have been bashing the story and I'm here to say the story is actually amazing. i love the introduction of the remnant they have a nice aesthetic and fit very well into the world. however the game feels as if it was rushed there seems to be half designed systems in place over and over again. another major complaint i have it the hybridization of the first game and the third. you see many reminiscent systems of both such as the land rover and ammo type along with the level system of weapons, which honestly hurts the game more then helps. its as if they took all the worst qualities of the first game and mashed it into this one. due to the many weapons being mostly the same stacking level ups of each other the gameplay becomes dull fast, in mass effect 3 you did not have this issue every weapon felt unique and brought something to the table in this game most of the weapons are identical due to the leveling system.

this brings me to the dumb decision of making you only able to use 3 yes three skills at once. you know what Dragon Age does right? it lets you use every god damn skill you unlock this game lets you use 3 only three. the combat is stale but the world is beautiful.

the MP in the mass effect series is one of its best staples and this game failed miserably  none of the classes feel unique they are all just remixes of the campaign class giving you no real incentive to play the mp. in mass effect three you literally had special classes only for the mp such as the sword teleporting slayer and the biotic whip Cerberus operative. in this game the N7 classes are just the best remixes of the ryder's classes. the MP is by far the worst to date.

i know the game is not going to get any updates the last one was in 2017 and i can with certainty tell you its ok to skip this one chief its trash.

- Horrible laggy consolized UI that any UI/UX designer should be ashamed of putting on their portfolio.
- ""Communicating with server"" on every action like equipping a weapon mod instead of doing it clientside and syncing with peers/server in the background like ME3 did.
- Still peer-to-peer meaning that if I play it with my friends on the other side of the world, at least one of us will have horrible latency issues, whereas in server-based games we can just play on US servers as a middle ground without issues.
- Worse netcode than ME3. At higher latency, enemies that are supposed to be dead constantly stick around at zero health and ""shoot"" at you (without actually dealing damage), but still distracting. You constantly get teleported back even when walking, not to mention sprinting, dodging or jumping.
- No hard cover, which in ME3 was a godsend because it allowed to reset your position [b]on host[/b] and remove latency-caused movement jitter at least for a while.
- New movement abilities (jetpack, slam) function poorly and feel extremely clunky compared to other games from that era featuring them.
- Awful character design. You have to actively [b]try[/b] to make asari ugly, but they succeeded.
- Awful sound design. Guns sound cheap, biotic and fire explosions are a faint echo of their ME3 iterations that inspired you to run biotic and tech tag teams just to enjoy the reverb booms tearing enemies apart.
- Uninspired and generic aesthetics that I wouldn't even recognize as Mass Effect if I saw them somewhere out of the game.

Mass Effect Andromeda is Bioware’s attempt to catch lightning a second time by introducing a new cast and story into the critically acclaimed Mass Effect universe. While the combat has been updated with a pleasant modern design, the original trilogy was about your connection to the characters, the choices you make, and how they affect your story. In Andromeda, I was never able to develop that connection due to bland characters who, even if you stabbed them in the back, would stare at you with the same dead eyed look that renders any of the good dialogue moot.

While Andromeda takes place in the Mass Effect story universe, as the name suggests, it does not take place in the same galaxy. You play as Ryder, a Pathfinder. A title held by only one member of each of the four Council races. You and one hundred thousand other explorers spread across four ark-like ships have volunteered to venture out into the great unknown, leaving the Milky Way behind to establish life in a new frontier. After being roused from your six-hundred-year nap in stasis by an unnatural cosmic storm-of-sorts enveloping the world that is supposed to be humanities new home. Time is of the essence as the lives of the twenty thousand humans, and your family, are in jeopardy if a viable habitat is not found. As you explore you find a hostile alien race and the all too familiar plot device, the highly advanced technology of an ancient civilization.

The combat, planet diversity, and exploration via the Nomad is where the game excels. While it is still a cover-based shooter, the jump jets attached to your armor introduce a new dimension to the exploration and combat with high-jumps, evades, and the ability to hover. The original Mass Effect had my favorite humanoid character design of any sci-fi game to date, but it is the planets of Andromeda that I was most impressed with. Similar to the glaring differences of each zone in World of Warcraft expansions, each (required) planet has its own theme of desert reds, cool blues, or toxic greens. Exploring these large planets is made more enjoyable with the Nomad, a vehicle very similar to, but vastly improved over the Mako. This six-wheeled beast will drive over almost anything, and what it has trouble with will undoubtedly be defeated by the jet-powered boost and jump abilities.

Andromeda has the bones for a fun sci-fi, exploration focused, action-adventure game but falls short as a story first role-playing game compared to its predecessor which ironically was the opposite. The main story feels like it was copied from Mass Effect’s homework, changing just enough to try to not get caught for plagiarism. The enemy forces you fight have a similar motif to the enemies of the previous two games, just on a smaller scale. The allure of mystery is enough to keep you interested for the first couple of hours but quickly becomes repetitive with the same design and elements in each dungeon you delve, all the way up to the finale. This quickly turns into, “follow the compass marker and check the necessary boxes of each location” to push the plot forward, instead of interesting interactions with characters driving you to each location. The added story element of unlocking your characters history through interacting with specific nodes on the map is a vehicle to force exploration but all I found were some admittedly pleasant scenic views and nothing else of note.

I was really excited to play after finishing the remaster of Mass Effect. Even with the lukewarm reception Andromeda received at release, it is essentially Star Trek in the Mass Effect universe. A new galaxy with new planets to explore, creatures to fight, and intelligent life to interact with. But of the four main locations I visited there were just eight or nine new creatures and only two new races are introduced. In a new galaxy. Two . Only one of which are you able to get a member of to join your crew. If you have played the original trilogy and enjoyed exploring each option on the conversation wheel, you’ll be disappointed to know that a lot of the additional dialogue options with characters are a waste of your time. To ensure the game is accessible to new players, a lot of dialogue options simply tell you about subjects you already know about, like the Genophage. Accompanying that dialogue are voices that did not fit the tone of the races you remember from Mass Effect. E.g., the salarian and krogan on board the main base, compared to Mordin and Eve from Mass Effect 3, just don’t give off the same vibe and breaks any immersion I was able to garner in the first hour or so.

The gameplay is fun enough to bear the time it takes to complete the main story, which can be done in a little under twenty hours. I played a solider-like build, akin to my Legendary Edition playthrough, swapping through four different types of weapons and three abilities to fight my way through the enemy . I say “soldier-like” because choosing a class is gone so you’re no longer locked to certain abilities based on your specialization. Instead, you are free to experiment with your build but each ability has a skill tree with each tier increasing in cost to unlock. I recommend unlocking everything at level one to see what you like and then respec your talent points into the build you want to commit to. The closest thing to specializations is now called Profiles, which give a bonus to or grant certain abilities and the effectiveness of those bonuses increase as you put more points into a correlating tree. While you are locked to three abilities at a time, you can set four different profile favorites with three abilities each, effectively giving you twelve different abilities to cycle through without having to return to a loadout station like you must for your weapon loadout.

Built on DICE’s Frostbite engine, it is no wonder the gameplay is good, but the animations are bad. Until around 2015, the engine was used almost exclusively for Battlefield games, which are not known for their in-depth facial animations as all cutscenes are pre-rendered. Andromeda did have one profound effect, it made me realize I have never truly understood the magnitude eye and brow animation has on selling character emotion. The lack of proper animation in scripted events is a testament to its importance. Even waiting to play until after the final patch was released, it does not seem like enough was fixed. If you’re playing on PC, I highly recommend using mods to improve some aspects. Luckily for the rest of us, some Mass Effect fans are so dedicated they’ve taken up the reins from Bioware when it comes to fixing bugs in Andromeda. The most noteworthy mention in my opinion is a mod called MEA FIXPACK by NightWolf2503 on NexusMods who has fixed dozens of bugs reported by users that Bioware left unresolved before abandoning the game.

Unfortunately, Andromeda just feels like Bioware used the Mass Effect IP to take advantage of fans desire for a new adventure in their beloved universe. Playing this game four years after its release, and two years after Anthem’s, Bioware’s other massive failure; it is easy to see that they just used fans to generate funding and testing for Anthem’s development . Since Mass Effect 4 announced via teaser trailer, the developers have confirmed the galaxies shown in the beginning are the Milky Way and Andromeda. I can only recommend playing Andromeda in case it has significant effects on the next game and you are a big enough fan of the universe that you want to understand any references that may be made. That is if you are even excited, or trusting enough, to play it with the consistent decline Bioware has had since Andromeda originally released…",1625635280,1625635280,False,6,0,0.542739450931549072,0,True,False,False

I avoided the last two games in the original trilogy because of criticism that they over simplified leveling and exploration.  

The core gameplay loop of jumpy/dashy/hovery/punchy/staby/shooty fights broken up with conversation, travel, and crafting works quite well, and the vanguard build with nova and charge is incredibly satisfying. They ability to cross-class is also rather interesting, and a nice change from the original game, where you were stuck with one thing or another.  Being able to hotswap between builds mid fight adds a nice level of depth to fights even if the implementation of that hotswap is a bit clunky. There is also little enough EXP to go around that your leveling  decisions still have weight, and this will add to the replay value if you like build tinkering like me.  

The story is also fairly good if a bit samey compared to the original trilogy.  I have hear people complain about the characters not being as good as those in the ME 2 and 3, but that's not really a fair comparison since this is a new story with completely new character, whom I generally like.  They all have a enough depth and humor in order to be enjoyable, and I have literally laughed out loud because of their antics on several occasions.  Admittedly, the facial animations are still a bit off, so if you can't stand the occasional trip into the uncanny valley (or in some cases an audition for The Exorcist head spining scene when Ryder can't decide where to look), perhaps give this one a miss.

I will admit to being rather annoyed by not being able to skip space travel cinematics.  Yes, you can skip them for movement within a solar system, but jumping from system to system has no skip.  Does it really take that long to load a solar system?  Also not being able to edit/access your loadout screen at will is rather frustrating in general, and infuriating when shopping.  ""Do I need this mod for my gun, I don't know because I can't access my loadout to see what it currently equipped.""

Still, its an overall positive experience, and I would commended it to people who want a middle ground between the first game and the last two.",1625632288,1625632288,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Coming back to it after all these years from a fresh play through of LE, a lot of the bugs and poor animations have been fixed and the game is quite enjoyable. 

While the games overall story inst as compelling as the trilogy the writing is what lets it down the most, and you cant get the same attachment to characters as you would in the trilogy.  The game can be a bit grindy if you are going for a completionist run, but the combat is massively improved and way more satisfying. I was sceptical when they removed the whole paragon/renegade system but it allows a much more refreshing and realistic approach to the morality choice, that doesn't lock you into the cliche good or evil.

While the game falls short from its predecessors its still a solid game and worth playing if you pick it up on sale. And mods do fix a lot of issues that the devs haven't fixed. 

Pros
-Combat (better gun play and more variety in builds) 
-Tempest design (no elevator or load screens to explore your ship)
-Morality system (no more cliche good or evil)
-QTE (tell you what will happen)
-Crafting System (more in depth than previous games)
-Selling items (always annoyed me they removed this from ME2 and ME3)
-Exploration (more in depth than ME1)
-Character creator (can make some good locking characters unlike the trilogy)
-Graphics (game can look quite stunning) 

Cons
-Writing (bit all over the place)
-Animations (can still be iffy)
-Voice acting (lack of emotions due to the writing)
-Glitches/bugs (most can be fixed with mods or reloading)
-Planet scanning (need mods to fix jerky camera when flying to a planet)
-Mining (tedious like in previous games recommend mods to fix this)

The game is great, it got a lot of hate upon release which I don't think was deserved. The game is virtually bug free now (I had a few CTD's, but not many), the combat is good and the characters are great. 

The story isn't as good as the original ME series, but decent overall with some great quests/dialogue. 

The thing to remember is that its an entirely different story, but set in the ME universe.

The one thing I will warn against is the 'Task' missions. Some of the 'Task' missions are very fun and/or provide you with interesting lore. However, quite a few of them boil down to : 

1. find a thing at a randomly generated location, 
2. scan the thing, 
3. look for 3 more randomly placed things to get a location marker, 
4. Go to the location and fight some enemies
5. Mission accomplished

This is fine the first couple of times you do them, but overall they don't contribute much bar giving you XP and maybe a bit of story roleplay. They have no effect on the game's ending or main characters and can be generally skipped. You'll be able to tell the difference between these tedious task missions and the worthwhile ones pretty easily, so avoiding them will save you a lot of time. 

The game has a satisfying enough ending, but there are 3/4 obvious plot points that need to be resolved and were almost certainly going to be for the future DLC that got cancelled. So it's a little disappointing that you can't get full closure on everything, but it's still worth playing.

So I've been holding off on reviewing this game basically since launch. After the three masterpieces that are the original trilogy I wanted to at least beat this game before reviewing it. I failed that goal.

The game starts off SO FREAKING GOOD! The first level is basically the exact kind of level you'd expect to see in the trilogy but slightly more open. It's still overall a linear level filled with mystery and combat and GORGEOUS graphics. However the ending of the level is very predictable and this sets the quality standard you can expect for the entire rest of the game. 

The very first bit after the intro level is still pretty cool. You get introduced to the main hub in a pretty interesting way and it sets the stage for what should have been a fantastic survival story. It's not though. At all. You would figure setting up outposts on planets that have both hostile environments AND enemies that want you dead would be very difficult. It isn't. At all. You'd figure if you set up an outpost before clearing all the enemies there'd be conflict. There isn't... at all. You literally just finish a few simple Sudokus (literally), have one or two small skirmishes and MAYBE one very small ""mission"" and bamn! You're all set on any one of the 5 planets you need to build habitats on. 

Okay fine, so the survival story isn't fantastic. The trilogy's story is hardly the most original either, right? But the trilogy has a super compelling enemy and loads of amazing characters. Andromeda has literally NONE of that. The Kett are such a generic main enemy. They have no personality. They do (main story spoilers) the same exact freaking thing the reapers do by converting various species for their purposes. They look boring and brown. They have no cool variants (I seriously consider the trilogy's banshee to be the best enemy in all games). There's just nothing interesting about them in any way. 

But even a boring enemy can be made up for with a brilliant cast around the player. I would hardly call the Collectors a very interesting enemy but I consider ME2 to be one of the best games ever made. I just freaking love Liara, Tali, Garrus, Miranda, Jack, Mordin, Samara and Legion. Heck I even love Morinth. All these squad members add so much to ME2 that I would happily play a spinoff starring any one of them. Then there's the long list of fantastic supporting characters. I even love to hate Ashley and Kaiden. Not one... single... character in Andromeda is even as interesting as Captain Bailey. Peebee is... okay. Her personality is to be annoying. So guess what? She's annoying. Everybody else is pure cardboard. But ""Don't Touch That"" guy is back!!

I do agree with everybody that says the gameplay is very good though. It combines ME1s mechanics with ME3s ""level up 3 times and then pick between two perks three times"". Primers and detonations are FAR more intuitive. Not being locked into a character class is also really nice. I was able to build a Vanguard Infiltrator which is super fun and not possible in the trilogy. The cover system is SO MUCH BETTER! You don't get sucked into cover. When you're near something your character will dynamically crouch with no button press an NO MOVEMENT RESTRICTION! Huge improvement to flow. I will say that I do not like the addition of the jump and dash mechanic. It makes escaping a bad situation trivial and it's never really used in an interesting way for exploration. 

The new Mako (Nomad) is just boring. It's slow even when boosting. Boost only lasts a brief moment but recharges so fast your basically constantly hitting the boost button. Shifting between 4WD and 6WD is only an extra step. No fun is added. Upgrades are insignificant. 

So I've made 2 attempts at beating this game. First time I made it 75 hours in while doing ALL side content. Eventually got bored because all missions are the same and quit. Even at 75 hours in I never felt like the main story was advancing. 2nd time I made it to the 35 hour mark and about 25 hours in just gave up on side content completely and focused only on the story. I made it ONE PRIMARY MISSION FARTHER than on my 75 hour playthrough... and hit the point of no return. I just sat there bewildered at the little warning box on my screen. Not one interesting story related thing had happened since the intro. I found that i simply did not care what happened on this final mission at all. Zero investment in any of it. So I quit. I'm done. The game is just so completely soulless and I never even brought up the dead faces on every single character.

It is almost nothing like the trilogy, I will admit that, but I would't say that's necessarily a bad thing. Andromeda is not trying to be a follow up to the trilogy, so anybody who bases their opinion of it off of a comparison to the trilogy alone isn't giving it a fair chance. 

That being said, this game is still flawed and deserves some of the criticism it gets. The writing is not bad, but there is a noticeable gap between the quality of writing in main quests and sidequests. Additionally, the endless stream of 'go here, get thing' fetch quests is irritating. Bioware's quest mentality in this game seemed to be quantity over quality, and it certainly shows. With all of the constant fetch quests added to your journal, at times this game can get overwhelming. If you are hoping for nothing but a straight, linear experience, this game is not for you.

It is hard to judge this game without thinking about how it compares to the trilogy, seeing as the Mass Effect Trilogy is just about the greatest game series in modern video game history. However, if you judge it on its merits and not its shortcomings, I am inclined to say that this is a pretty good game.

The answer to that question is ""Yes"" provided:

1) You are okay with installing some mods to fix the biggest quality-of-life and graphical issues
2) You understand the game can be super grindy if you insist on doing every mission
3) You know that Ryder is not Shepard 2.0
4) You love the Mass Effect setting and want to see a slightly different spin on it
4) It is on sale

That out of the way, here are my more detailed thoughts:

ME:A is first of all, an absolutely gorgeous game. It's clear the environments had a lot of thought behind them and while I do think Eos and Eladeen seem similar (both are desert-like environments), the other planets have a good variety and are quite satisfying to explore.

The plot is good, not great: you are the son/daughter of the Pathfinder in the only colony ship that arrived in Andromeda. Due to some events you end up thrust into being the sole Pathfinder assigned to the Andromeda Initiative and you need to help keep the entire thing from collapsing in on itself. You arrive a while after the first wave and so some things have already happened and it's not a completely virgin galaxy. That said, I think things were better for it, otherwise every world would've felt very same-y with just a different tile set. With the different factions that arise before Ryder shows up, it lets each world feel a bit different.

Combat is great, the best in the Mass Effect series. My only complaint is that 3 skills aren't nearly enough and the Profile system seems cool on paper but in reality I mostly just stuck with one.

Characterization is an area where I think the game does its best. No, you aren't going to have characters as amazing as Garrus or Tali, but they're all quite memorable and, for a first in the series, *some of the characters do not get along well at all*. It's kind of like managing the Miranda/Jack relationship in ME2 but expanded. If you take Liam and Vetra along on a mission they will spend the whole time bickering in a pretty nasty way. Your helmsman and chief engineer despise each other. It's a unique dynamic and much more realistic given the intense stress every character in the game is under.

So, in summary, I think this is a game that was panned too hardly on first release that is actually fairly good now, provided you keep its limitations in mind and don't go in expecting to play something identical to the original trilogy.

Now thanks to ME:LE, I get to experience the series that so many people love and adore.  To people who just finish the trilogy and crave for more ME, if you are on the fence because of the online reviews, don't worry about them. Andromeda is the game for you.

pros:
- gameplay, graphic, best in the series.
- paragon/renegade system is gone. Being able to choose the response you want is liberating, adding so much immersion to the role playing aspect. 
- I like that it's a new story, a fresh start. Shepard's journey is complete. Let's just leave the best memory intact. Some cameos from the OG are nice, but there's no need to ruin it by overdoing the old characters just because the trilogy is successful. Same reason why ""Force Awaken"" works and ""The Last Jedi"" doesn't. Now that there's a new ME on the way, I'm hoping Bioware wouldn't do the same mistake like Star Wars.
cons:
- UI is pretty bad, specifically crafting/equipment/map etc. Not a good look for something that came out in 2017.
- Needs a lot of QoL changes. There's no way The Pathfinder can jump FTL into the universe and have to fly off a planet just to read emails.
- Open world copy/pasta fetch quest gets pretty tiring about half way through the game. But hey, that's what the genre does. Maybe they could keep them more ""tight-knit"" with the crew members will work better.
- Dialogue proc issue very annoying. SAM/party banter/quest dialogue all proc at the same time and you can't understand a damn thing.

I've played the ME: Legendary edition and compared to the original trilogy it is not [i] as [/i] good, but the original trilogy set the bar very very high to be fair.

The gunplay in this game feels really good, I would say better than the previous 3 games. The combat system feels solid and the removal of any fixed classes is a big improvement. Sadly you can only have 3 abilities at one time and you cannot instruct your squadmates to use their abilites, they just use them when they feel like it.

The graphics and sound design are also really really great, as expected from a AAA title. The facial animations are okay after many patches. Not as bad as at release but also nothing to write home about. Interestingly, the walking/running/jumping animations are superb. 

ME: Andromeda's biggest weakness is its writing. Most of your squadmates are rather uninteresting, save for maybe the Krogan and the Turian. There are a few missions to earn their loyalty like in ME:2, but AFAIK this doesn't really change much and they are not as good as the original trilogies loyalty missions. The main antagonist aliens are also somewhat bland. They are your average evil ""destroy everything in our path"" baddies.

Honestly, I was excited for this even with all the bad review I thought ""Well I'm sure they've fixed all the issue"". They didn't. There were a lot of bugs, but the only game breaking bug I've encountered was one where the door to the ship wont open and i had to restart the game. Other bugs are mostly visual, mechanics and sometimes your character would just talk to literally no one. 

The world of Andromeda is pretty small even though they hype it up, there's only a few planet where you can go and the rest are just for you to find one resource is all. Even then the world itself is pretty uneventful with mostly a lot of nothings. When you do land on the worlds that you can, the cinematic is unskipable, which I assume is them loading and it is actually really long and you'll be seeing it everytime you land, so you'll be seeing the same bugs scuttle away everytime.

My biggest issue with this game is the quest. OMG the quest are so boring and dull. Most of the side quest and some of the main quest are just fetch quest. Most quest goes something like this: Talk to person A, go investigate point of interest (just find 1 thing usually) at planet 1, talk to person B, go to planet 2, talk to person C, go to planet 3, investigate point of interest again, go back and talk to person A. There are tons of quest like this and they're just a waste of time, especially if you work and don't have that much to give.

The enemies are all the same, not a lot of variety. Creatures on planet A are basically the same as creatures on planet B but with a different color. Umm...can you atleast make them a bit more interesting? not to mention you only see 2 new species of sentient lifeform

The companions, if you compare them to ME1-3 then you're going to be disappointed. Most of the companions are kind of off putting in a sense and some of them just get over things a bit too fast. E.G you did something bad to someone and they're like ""How could you evil man!"" then 1 mission latter ""Hey dude! how ya doing? hahaha!"". Some of the companion's don't get explored much. We do get to see some parts of them but it's usually a short 3-5 minute of cinematic and that's it. and dont get me started with their AI. Their AI is so bad at times I wish I didnt even have them around.

There are some good in it, I enjoy the gunplay, it feels nice and impactful as well as the fact that you aren't 'locked' to a class is fun and amazing. It kind of is sad that you can only use only 3 different abilities but hey whatever. Some of the cutscenes are amazing and a few of the places you find actually feels mesmerizing.

TLDR::
CONS:
1. Still a lot of bugs in the game
2. Big galaxy and planets with nothing in it and a damn cutscene everytime you land (about 30s per)
3. Everything is a damn fetch quest. Most quest/sidequest force you to go talk to lots of people ""find"" things and travel to other planet..for just one quest meaning you'll be at the landing cutscene a lot.
4. Not a lot of enemy/creature/lifeform variety
5. Companion AI is bad, their story and characteristics arent fleshed out and when you make them mad, they get over it quick..like really quick.

Honestly playing this game for me felt more like a chore half of the time. If you dont have a lot of free time and this isnt on sale, I wouldn't recommend this.

Pros::
1. Visually at times are stunning
2. Gunplay was impactful and fun
3. Not locked to a class like ME1-3, can mix and match abilities",1625423411,1625423411,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I never got superwarm with ME 1&2 but played them quite a bit. This game looks a lot less like an RPG because none of the dialog choices really matter, they just add some flavor to the story.
The story in not that great and has huge holes in it - so far. A lot of small things don't really make sense or feel strange.
The game itself feels a lot like a platformer because effectively this is all you do. Jump and run around shoot at enemies and collect materials while solving undercomplex puzzles.
The game looks okay, it has its glitches but you can forgive those. The controls feel muddy but you can halfway navigate without too much frustration. And the story provides you with a little reason why you want to get to the next checkpoint.
The skillpoint system and weapon modification feels like it has little to no impact on actual gameplay. It's there, it has complexity, it just doesn't have enough impact. Just like dialog choices it just adds flavor to your gameplay.

I honestly don't even know why this game is in my library, but I would not buy it again. I can only recommend it to ME Fans that desperately want something from that universe. For everyone else, whether you want good controls, good story, good puzzles, good platforming, good shooting - there are better games for each of these out there.

After I finished my first playthrough I decided to buy the legendary trilogy because i wanted more mass effect before eventually coming back to andromeda. right now i'm close to finishing ME1 and I can honestly say if I started with ME1 I would of dropped the game fairly quickly, they gameplay feels incredibly slow, for all the hate andromeda got for bugs and technical issues I only ever ran across one issue that was a result of my graphics driver, compared to andromeda the controls, the mobility, the combat, and dont get me started and that GOD AWFUL mora controls, when I drove the NOMAD I genuinely enjoyed it, the mora on the other hand was so horrible i almost walked away from the game several times bc it was so frustrating for me to drive, almost all of it was painful for me and made me decide early on to just rush through the mainline to get to ME2. and i'm not even hating on it bc it's old either, KOTOR ( 4 years older) and dragon age origins (only 2 years newer) so you cant tell me that all of ME1's flaws are bc of it's age, KOTOR is proof that bioware was able to create an amazing game 4 years before mass effect came out. both KOTOR and DAO are to this day some of my favorite games. now lets talk about characters and story. i have to say the opposite of most people, i spent the whole game with peebee and jaal on my squad and loved both characters, wheras in ME1 the characters bored me, for example the Asari love interests (which are my favorites, they're a really beautiful race), peebee was always fun to be with for me, she felt very much like a real person, she had spark, personality, story, you actually had to WORK to gain her affection and trust, everything about her was adorable and i loved her. compare that to liara and i feel none of that. all I really see of liara is she's a scientist with poor social skills that took WAAAAY too little effort to romance and i couldn't really find myself caring about her that much. then theres the Antagonists. It boggles my mind that people find sovereign somehow more interesting than the Archon. The sovereign is just your run of the mill cocky artificial life that thinks organic life is beneath them, and always looks down on you, there are literally hundreds of antagonists just like him, and he bored the shit out of me. meanwhile the archon seemed more real to me, he was a man with an obsession for an ancient technology who believed he was doing good. while The Archon looked down on other life forms in the beginning, and as you continue to beat him, he actually acknowledges you as a serious threat and even calls you a rival and eventually a worthy opponent even when he managed to reach his goal and gained a massive amount of power. let's even compare the kett to the geth. the kett were a race of people who fast tracked evolution by stealing the genetic advantages of other species, whereas the geth were just boring mindless robots, plus there was not a single geth i can remember, there were some kett that showed some personality and fervor like the cardinal and the sword, or how about the ""elite soldiers"" the ascendents and so on who had those orbs where somewhat interesting to fight plus you had the assimilated krogans/solarians who provided a little more challenge and showed how much of a threat the kett posed. there are very very few species that can be compared to the kett, whereas the geth were extremely bland, forgettable robots that you can find dozens of comparisons to in all forms of media. then how about the council vs the nexus leaders. the council to me was no more than one group of arrogant braindead jackasses who couldnt believe that anyone else could know better than them, none of them had any individuality, they literally felt like the same person in 3 bodies, whereas the leaders of the nexus actually had some personality and individuality, they had differing opinions, they had flaws and strengths, and more importantly they had intelligence and knew when to listen to ryder and admit when they were wrong and as ryder accomplished more and more they began to trust, respect, and more importantly listen to Ryder when she warned them about the dangers the Archon presented. they seemed liked they cared about the success of the nexus, whereas the council just didnt give a shit about anything Shepard had to say. never gave shepard any trust or respect, ore even heeded any warnings she gave no matter how much she proved her capability. it really felt like the council cared more about being right and being above shepard than the actual people they were supposed to protect. then there's the worlds, the worlds in andromeda felt very real and were absolutely breathtaking. ME1 worlds on the other hand all felt really small and bland, plus all the weird structures ME1 placed for cover felt extremely out of place alot of times and ruined the immersion for me, this made worse by how shitty the cover system was. I regularly found my character going into cover in places where I didn't want to and not going into cover when and where I did and I died so frequently i went the engineer route just so i wouldnt have to worry about cover, whereas in andromeda the controls felt extremely responsive and fluid, my character always did what i wanted when i wanted. I was Genuinely excited by the prospect of seeing the higher ranks of the kett in subsequent andromeda games, and now i wont bc everyone shitting all over andromeda and comparing it to AN ENTIRE TRILOGY. in conclusion there is literally not one single thing about ME1 that i liked more than andromeda. if i felt like it i could literally write several pages more about all of the things andromeda did better than 1.",1625375892,1625375892,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sometimes I felt, the NPCs themselves don't really care about what is happening.

This was my first Mass Effect title and the popularity of the franchise made me purchase it during sale. Sadly the game did not deliver (for me at least).",1625337308,1625337308,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game is optimised,i got stable framerates (120-144fps).There are some minor bugs,but not game changers.

The gunplay is very good,also the builds diversities.

Main story is good written,and interesting.

Side missions a little bit boring like any other open world games (ME:Andromeda is semi open world,like Metro Exodus).

I highly recommend this game,especially during sales.

While I will admit it has it's flaws, even now after supposedly being patched by EA, I think that the characters and story were interesting. All in all, I really enjoyed the game. I spent about 75 hours and finished all the major missions and side missions. The only stuff I didn't complete were many of the tasks, simply because they were scavengers which may have provided interesting lore but ultimately were too much of a pain in the ass. Yes the UI had some seriously clunky elements and the inability to skip some cutscenes is a source of personal frustration, but honestly  other parts make up for it. The combat was okay, I didn't particularly like being limited to three powers, but it was engaging enough to keep me going. However I really appreciated the fact that it was back to a multi armor/multi gun type of game, the very COD feeling of ME3 left me feeling sour. I found the voice acting to be fairly decent and while some people have complained about the characters, they are different people from those in the original trilogy. If you wanted to have a character be a carbon copy of Shepherd, Garrus, Tali, or Wrex then you should have played the original trilogy. The entire theme of the game is new beginnings, finding something new far from home and trying to make it work. I personally found that the character interactions were heartfelt and wholesome, you actually get to know your crew as people and not just personality traits.

I can deal with:

*The Sims character designs.
*Fanfic plot from random teen. (150yo spacefaring civilization is already bored with ~300 billion systems).
*Dialogue lines recorded at a mall foodcourt.
*Complete lack of professionalism from just about the entire crew (Ryder included).
*Conversation tree that has me pulling (what's left of my) hair out.
*Side Quests that often made no sense, and/or broken, and/or no bearing on the story at all.
*Consolified menu system that takes 8-10 KB/mouse actions just to change a quest marker via journal.
*Dumbed down Squad Mate system (can't use squad powers or change weapons).
*Longish+unskippable takeoff/landing cut scenes.
*No manual saves during many storyline missions (took about 3 hours before I could make my first non-auto save).
*Etc

The exploration and combat was decent enough that spacebar'ing through everything else was tolerable; Until I got ~25 hours in, and realized that all of the planets were likely to have environmental hazard pressure.

Exploration kept me playing but grew increasingly tedious when constantly on the clock with a bunch of whingy/cringy backseat drivers. At one point Ryder shouted ""I SWEAR I WILL TURN THIS CAR AROUND"" and it was so ironic I almost laughed.

It's really a pity, there's the framework for a great game there. I'm sure to revisit it sometime, probably stick to using only Vetra & Drack if possible.

The main problem with this game is that the story and characters are not well written. Both could be compelling in more skillful hands, but as rendered they are flat and/or in some cases even unlikable. Characters in the original Mass Effect usually if not always had a compelling conflict and backstory that Shepherd could directly engage with. Here, character problems are low-stakes. You simply don't care what happens to these people, because they are so bland. Voice acting is tolerable, but generally doesn't help because Ryder sounds so milk toast (at least as the male version). A complete lack of facial animation does the voice acting no favors. I don't think I've ever seen my character smile! Missions generally involve combat or ""scanning"" items. Combat is alright, but lacks the 'punch' and visceral nature that Bioware nailed in the Unreal Engine. Hovering is nice but doesn't add a lot in terms of new tactics. Abilities are a mix of some new things and what came before, but the limitation of only being able to use 3 abilities greatly limits the scope of effective tactics. Abilities are balanced in a way such they are generally not very useful until you've maxed them out, which doesn't help either. Combat difficulty at normal settings is low, barring a few random spikes where enemies are swarming you and there is no cover. The modding system is versatile but so costly in terms of resources that it's hard to have fun with it by trying very many combinations. Scanning is not a compelling mechanic in any game, and is just a slog, particularly since the scanner can't seem to properly register at even medium distances. I could go on but you probably get the idea. If I weren't terribly bored with other games, I wouldn't be playing this. Unless you are as bored as I am, I recommend that you leave it alone, even on sale. My overall conclusion is that this game shows you just how special the original trilogy was. If you sucked the soul out of Mass Effect, this is what you'd get-- a collection of systems that, lacking the emotional impetus of a great writing, fail to cohere into an experience that is more than the sum of its parts.",1625073777,1625073777,False,46,1,0.725587308406829834,2,True,False,False

So when I first tried to play through the game I think I felt as most people did, it was riddled with bugs and felt like cheap knock off to what we wanted. I finally took the time after 4 years and in the end I am glad I did. Andromeda has it's issues, it's almost solely the facial animations and somewhat clunkier controls, it feels insane that a game could feel worse than those that came 5 years before it. 

But under the failed launch and third-string developer there actually is a game worth trying. Whether you feel like the characters lack the depth and emotions of those from the Trilogy, there's a pretty interesting and fun class of characters in Andromeda. In the new galaxy we don't find too many new species to learn from, but the Angara are a great alien to discover, where Jaal might be the game's best. They make Andromeda obviously the most interesting part, which is why it sucks that they and the Kett are pretty much it in the world. While we leave behind great aliens like the Quarians, Volus, etc. I hope we maybe see more in the future for this franchise. As much as I'm hoping we go back to the Milky Way in the new Mass Effect, I wouldn't be disappointed to see Andromeda and Ryder's story continue, I believe it deserves it.

In short form, if you can handle the odd facial animations and the game's new third person shooter style you will most likely find the good in Andromeda.

 Cóż, radzę nie oceniać Andromedy przez pryzmat trylogii Mass Effecta. Są tam jakieś nawiązania do poprzednich części, lecz nic nie wnoszą one do historii w tej grze. Odrywając Andromedę od trylogii Sheparda to muszę uznać, że nie jest to gra tragiczna, ale do epickości tutaj daleko. Powiedziałbym, że to takie 50/50. Daję kciuk w górę, ale się nie cieszę. (if you know what I mean).
 Plusy:
 + Dynamiczny system walki, łączenie umiejętności w różne combosy i ograniczona możliwość walki w zwarciu
 + Względnie ciekawy wątek fabularny. Ryder, czyli główny bohater/ka nie jest żołnierzem, to nie jest Widmo ani żadne N7, to nastolatek rzucony na głęboką wodę, z czasem się wyrabia i jak z początku wszyscy patrzyli na niego z góry, tak później dostrzegli w nim prawdziwy potencjał.
 + Bogate możliwości craftingu i modyfikacji uzbrojenia
+ Na stan 2021r. multiplayer wciąż żywy, choć to takie +/-, bowiem to kalka z ME 3, czyli monotonne misje, z tym że jest mniej fal. 
MINUSY:
- Z jednej strony uzdatnianie planet do zamieszkania dawało satysfakcję, z drugiej strony to było bardzo powtarzalne, schematyczne zadania, latanie ze skanerem i tak do porzygu
- TYLKO 3 umiejętności możliwe do przypisania do action baru - Nie wiem co za geniusz wpadł na ten pomysł, ale jestem na nie
- Towarzysze pod względem osobowości nie porywają. Na uwagę zasługują Pebee i Jaal. Pebee to Asari ale nieco zwariowana i wyraźnie różniąca się od innych przedstawicielek tej rasy. Jaal natomiast jest Angarem, czyli reprezentantem nowej rasy w tej grze. Głównie przez to że jest to ktoś nowy, to chce się poznawać historię, kulturę i zwyczaje jego ludu
 -/+ Sporo osób zarzuca Andromedzie kiepskie animacje i mimikę twarzy u postaci, nie zwracałem na to szczególnie uwagi, zwłaszcza że twarz Mirandy w ME 2 i 3 bardziej utkwiła mi w pamięci XD
 -  Dialogi? Nie chodzi o teksty, choć te bywały bezbeczne, może to przez polską wersję, nie wiem. Ale Andromeda zgubiła pewnego rodzaju filmowość do jakiej przyzwyczajony byłem w Mass Effekcie (tak wiem, porównywanie do trylogii przed czym przestrzegałem)
 - Odnosiłem wrażenie że moje decyzje nie mają zbyt dużego znaczenia w dalszej perspektywie. Co najwyżej w określonych sytuacjach na tu i teraz, ale nic co by odbiło się w dalszym horyzoncie czasowym.
 Całościowo? 5, może 6 na 10. Gdyby Andromeda miała kontynuację to może by łatwiej było ją ocenić przez pryzmat bardziej rozbudowanej historii. Jakiś potencjał w grze był, część rozwiązań zastosowano w ramach eksperymentu, niektóre były w porządku, inne nie do końca. Jeśli macie możliwość zdobycia tytułu za 30-40zł, to myślę że w tej cenie warto

ENGLISH:

 Well, I'd recommend you to not rate Andromeda by looking at trillogy of Mass Effect. There are any references to previous parts, but they're not connected to the history of Andromeda at all. Detaching Andromeda from trillogy of ME, I have to admit , that  it's not a tragic game, as well as it's not an epic one. I'd rate it 50/50, cause it's really hard to state a clearly verdict. That's why I'm givin' a thumb up, but without any enthusiasm.

 PROS:
+ Dynamic combat system - different combos and limited possibility to fight melee
+ Relative interesting plot. Ryder (main character) is not Spectre or any N7, he/she's a teenager, casual guy thrown into a deep end. At the begining people around were looking down at Ryder, later they perceived his/her potential. 
 + Rich possibilities of crafting and adding mods to equipment
 + At 2k21 multiplayer works, I mean they're still people there. But well, It's copied from ME3, so monotonic missions and that's all
 CONS:

 - On the one hand, making the planets able to settlement, was bringing a satisfaction, however, It's monotonic, each planet required similar quests. You have to walk with scanner almost always switched on, so you can scan everything around
- ONLY 3 abilities on action bar. Dunno who was such a genius and inplemented that, but I'm not in. I preffer to have got more skills possible to use.
- The personality of the crew... Only Peebe and Jaal are interesting, to be honest, rest of the group is dull. Pebee is an Asari, pretty cool person, Jaal is an Angar - new race, that's why he's fascinating, cause new race makes you know their culture, history etc. 
- Dialogues? I don't mean they're bad. But, by trillogy of ME (I know, I shouldnt compare'em to each other) I get used to watch and listen to them such as movie, film (I don't know how to express it in another way). Andomreda lost this vibe. 
- I think our decissions were meaningless in the further perspective, they're relevant only now and here, but later you can surely forget about this. 
 Overall? I'd rate it on 5, maybe 6/10. If Andromeda had any sqeuels, then it would be more suitable to judge. There was a little potential I guess, some things were added as an experiment, some of'em were even nice, but some well... No comment. If you can get that game during a sale, I will advice you to buy then. At that price I think it's worth.",1625070299,1625070299,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes, the writing is a mixed bag, but it does definitely have its highlights particularly in some of the interactions you have with your crew and the banter they engage in while you're driving around in the Nomad (though a good amount of that banter is cringy as well). Other than that though, this game has better actual gameplay than any of the other ME game in my humble opinion. The combat is incredibly fun and satisfying, particularly with the added verticality of being able to boost jump through the air and the fact that you can learn and combine whatever types of abilities you want from the 3 categories of engineer, soldier, and biotic, rather than being restricted to one set class type like in previous ME games. I also found the Nomad itself to be a good amount of fun to drive even though it does get a bit excessive with how much you actually use it in the game. Nonetheless, I liked the open world nature of the game and the freedom to wander around alien worlds at your own leisure. I think it really added a layer of exploration that was sorely lacking from the other ME games, except for ME1 (though the exploration in this game is notably better IMO).

For me, it is actually nice to play. It doesn't live up to ME 1 through 3, but it still is a nice SciFi Game. There is one very negative thing I noticed: You can't save everywhere and there is no quicksave option. Cutscenes are also not skipable, so there is much tedium when replaying, especially when debugging.

I only bought it because it was on sale and I consider it a good buy for less than 10 USD. But I wouldn't recommend paying full price.

It also frequently crashes after installation. I encountered two types of crashes which are fixable:

1. First crash (usually there is a window indicating that the GPU ran out of VRAM, which is not the case) occurs due to the program running OOM. It needs humongous amounts of RAM. 64GB is not enough, I had to configure swap since Windows still has the memory overcommit feature not implemented. The game only allocates it, it doesn't actually use it. This means that your system will not run out of physical RAM, just out of virtual address space. You should be fine with the pagefile as workaround. Bad programming.

2. Crash is more nvidia driver related and says that the DX device has been removed. You can fix it by creating a new DWORD in:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> CurrentControlSet -> Control -> GraphicsDrivers
Name it ""TdrLevel"" and make sure the value is ""0"".

Is it a bit of a let-down compared to Mass Effect 1, 2 and 3? Is it showing signs of being rushed out the door such as the Quarian Ark just.... never showing up? Have the beautifully dressed up and well thought out linear level designs been traded in favour of bland open world spaces with nothing to do in them except waste time driving or killing the same 5 respawning kett over and over again? Does the new facial animation technology they used and everyone's running animations look like a character you'd make in Spore's creature stage? I have to answer yes to all of these questions.

So why am I thumbs upping if it's so problem-ridden? Well, two reasons.

One, if you're a fan of the other games, we all just want more of this universe - and there is some decent exploration of the mass effect lore to be had. It's cool to see female Krogan and Turians in various roles throughout the galaxy, it helps diversify the NPCs into feeling more realistic and fleshed out. Some characters like Peebee, an asari who did away with trying to become a biotic justicar (or a stripper like seemingly all the other ones) in favour of tech and ADHD humour.

Secondly, you can fix a lot of the horrible visual issues with mods. You'll still have your nicer looking Ryder's face rigged up to the same janky facial animations - but it goes a long way in helping you retain some level of immersion.

Just make your own mind up and don't worry about regretting it. This game was never AWFUL, it just had a lot to live up to and they made something painfully mediocre when the world was waiting to the second coming of Christ himself in ME4",1624925646,1624925646,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a great game — not a good one, a GREAT one — that was packed into a world too large for it to fill. And that's sort of the point. As someone who fell in love with gaming with ME1, this felt like returning home.

As some background, Andromeda was rushed through development and had all sorts of drama. Tons of features and storylines never made it off of the whiteboard, and that shows in how large the worlds are and how much time you spend literally driving between the plot points. (That's my biggest annoyance. The commuting. It's awful). But again, that's the point: You're in a new galaxy, and there's a lot of space to explore.

The friends you bring along for the ride are great. Every one of the squad on the Tempest feels like they matter. Where characters like Garrus and Ashley took two or three games to build out, Peebee and Drak seem like people, caught up in a big world. And where Shepard was a mostly blank slate for you to control (c'mon, admit it, you grew up playing ME1-3, but Shep didn't), Ryder has genuine character development — the kid waking up from cryo turns into a real leader by the end game. The best part about Ryder is that you decide that growth, too.

Combat is terrific, as well. Once I figured out that I could switch profiles with the function buttons, I decimated the Kett. I'd charge in and wipe out a squad as a Vanguard, then dig in as a Sentinel when the reinforcements arrived and clean them up as an Adept. An amazing feature. And the jump jets! The Normandy crew wouldn't stand a chance if Ryder literally flew over them.

This isn't ME1-3, though. The real-world stories and the characters make that clear. The story isn't as tight, the pressure isn't as high, and you're not opening the door to a dozen new galactic civilizations; you're trying to (re)build one. Get excited about that, and as you play, be patient when it takes a long Nomad ride to get there.

There's a lot they did right with this game. They must have spent a fortune making it. Tons of quests and lot and side stuff. Voices for most character's a good. The graphics/animations are very well done. The sounds are outstanding, the guns crack off better than any game I've played. Main Story line is so so, I won't complain too much. I always think the simple non-main stories are better.

The issues I have with it are the sporadic loot lists and the sloppy and disconnected crafting system and strike force and AVP systems. The leveled loot lists are the same system as from the 1st game, I didn't care for it back then and to see they have the same system now bothers me. There could have been a lot more original assets. Seeing the same small buildings over n over, reguardless of which planet I'm on or which race's planet I'm on seems odd. 

But the real issues with this game I have are the persistent bugs/glitches that I was shocked to see still exist in the 'deluxe edition'. Lets just say these bugs are often and very noticeable. I'm sure the bug list is smaller than when they 1st released the game, but this game is still buggy a fuck. Not buggy enough to make me quit playing, but enough to annoy the F out of me and realize once again what a joke BioWare is these days. How far we've fallen.

I experienced little to no bugs and absolutely no crashes. I ran this game on Ultra settings through the whole game and only experienced minor framerate dips. I played this game on a laptop.

The main story is alright, but I consider the original trilogy to have an alright main story as well. Andromeda's story shines through it's side/companion quests. For the villain, you face a galactic threat(yet again) which is the Kett this time. They are basically the same as the Collectors from ME2. Mass Effect is not known for having great villains and that is the same with this game.

Contrary to what most people think, I believe the companions are fun and interesting (Keep in mind that I have played the other games). Companions have multiple loyalty missions as opposed to usually just one and they span across the entire game. Dialogue is also better than the original trilogy and I find myself loving parts of it regardless of it being weak at times. I played FemRyder for my playthrough and found her lovable.

But, like any other release now a days, especially with EA and companies like them, you may get an unfinished game.

Usually at some point in the game there is a chance the Devs and the Publisher decided to just give up and release an unfinished product.

Do I recommend it right now? Yes, because it is on sale for $10.00 including all DLC. (Summer Sale ((I love STEAM)))

I wouldn't pay anymore for this game though.

I am waiting to see if EA pulled another one of their bullshit moves and somehow is going to suck the fun out of a game I bought.

But, I am hopeful it won't happen. I am only 4 hours into the game at the time of this review and if something changes, I will change my review.

There is one negative thing I will say about this game and it is the third party registration with EA Origin.

I don't give a fuck about EA. They are one of the Kings of MTX and bullshit Pay to win underhanded business models. They can suck a dick.

The only reason I am buying this game is because it is on sale for $10.00, and it is a great series.

I am not interested in using Origin to buy my games, setup a subscription with them at all, or support EA through Origin.

STEAM has always been good to me, and I am not about to change hands for my video game needs. Especially not with an untrustworthy company like EA.

Ubisoft has tried this tactic too, and it didn't work either.

It is because both of those companies have lost their integrity. It is such a fucking shame.

I do recommend this game though. For $10.00 it is  GREAT DEAL. You can thank STEAM for that.

It's open world story is full of busywork that makes the fetch quests of ME1-3 feel exciting by comparison. At least in the original trilogy you could 100% each game in under 40 hours.

The enemy faction isn't compelling either, their tech aesthetic seemingly ripped off from the Grineer from Warframe.

The crew of the tempest was very enjoyable imo, much more than the Dragon age inqusition team. they all have a ton of things to say and the the actual party members have an insane amaount of dialouge beween them both on the tempest and on missions.

The original Mass Effect trilogy felt like a passionate attempt to create an epic sci-fi universe and you could feel that passion through every moment of the original trilogy.

The story, the characters, voice acting, and the animations (oh god, the animations), just feel like minimal effort was put into everything and it just results in a mediocre experience. 

People were praising the combat in Andromeda, but I just don’t see it. The combat was perfected in Mass Effect 3 and this just feels like a step down, as fights are pretty dull and repetitive. The entire quest structure feels like a repetitive grind, similar to the issues plaguing Dragon Age Inquisition.

If you’re looking for more content after playing the original trilogy, I would suggest you avoid this one. This is representative of all the issues which modern Bioware games have now.

The gameplay is nothing like the original games, the writing is just terrible and the story has nothing to do with Mass Effect, it was just a quick cash grab by EA, as is most of their game library now. The characters were all bland and poorly written, and very overboard on the characters sexual desires, as if it was written by some lonely woke feminist whose only life experience was the 4 years of screaming and protesting that college taught them. I'm not really sure what EA was thinking, or how Bioware ended up in the sad and sorrowful state they are in today, but its a far cry from the glory days of Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect 1 and the original Dragon Age. Now, it seems the studio and publisher are only concerned with telling over the top in your face social justice narratives, ignoring everything that actually made video games great. What's so wrong with Andromeda? Well, maybe if they focused on making a playable game with a good story to tell instead of what genitals the characters are interested in, it would have been a masterpiece. Instead what we find is an overtly feminist Krogran civilization, nothing at all like the real Krogran that were experienced in the original trilogy. The amount of glitches this game launched with and still carries even now (acknowledging that EA halted all updates and support for the game) is all the proof that is needed for us to know neither the devs or the publisher cared about the fans of Mass Effect, but solely wanted a cash grab while gaining some good old ""woke capitalism"" points and ignored everything about what made Mass Effect such a great series.
Don't hold out hope that the next game, which is supposedly taking place in the Milky Way again, will be any different or any better.

I hardly know what commander shepherd's face looks like. So there is no pre-existing nostalgia or disdain for me as I got into the game. I also got the game on a steep discount, which I will discuss later. The only thing I know about Mass Effect: Andromeda was that facial animations are laughably bad and that in general most people who played this game on release really hated the game.

 In all honesty, I only bought the game for 7,50 euros, and under the impression that I was buying a game so bad that I would laugh all the way through (or at least until I dropped it). Which fortunately is not the case at all, even though there are moments where I laughed out loud at the bad facial animation, or the excruciatingly bad delivery which does happen from time to time, the game isn't that bad at all. It's no masterpiece however, I had plenty of fun playing this game, and do believe that the amount of hate the game gets is unwarranted. Let's list the pros and cons and I'll explain.

Pros: 1: The combat feels responsive and fluid, weapons feel nice to use and there are actual choices that change the way you will approach combat situations. Same with all the potential builds you can make. Profiles, which are basically akin to class bonuses depending on how you level up your character and what you have active at the time. Together with weapons, companions, passive and active abilities, give the potential for a lot of fun builds that will suit the way you like playing the game.

2: Characters: I over all really enjoyed most of the characters from main to secondary ones, with a few exceptions of course, and their quest lines. As an example, [spoiler] Drack is an absolute bro of a character and his ending quest feels like playing in a die hard movie. [/spoiler]

3: Story. While the story is nothing groundbreaking, it's well executed enough for me to say that I really enjoyed the story for the flaws it has.

4: Nomad banter: Your companions will talk to one another whilst you are driving your nomad (basically a futuristic 4x4), their dialogue is well delivered and made me laugh a lot of times which made the whole experience of driving around and not using the fast travel system a lot more enjoyable for me.

5: Ending: I won't spoil anything, all I'll say is that the ending, for me at least (this review is my opinion after all) was well worth it.

Cons: 1: Facial animations: I'm sure that most of the people who have heard about this game have heard of 1 thing. Facial animations are comically bad. They are all 100% correct. The facial animation in this game are so bad to the point of being so bad it's good and straight back to bad again.

2: Character customization: There is absolutely no way to make a character that does NOT look borderline like a lobotomite. Something not helped by the fact that Ryder's line delivery half the time is agonizingly bad and the facial animations do him no favours at all.

3: Dialogue option: Like many other so called ""RPG"" games, you really have almost no choice in what you say or what happens in the story at all. Sure there is the [u] illusion of choice. [/u] However, when most of your choices mean absolutely nothing to the way events play out (apart from maybe a few different dialogue lines I guess).

4: Ryder's personality: Something that I really hated in this game is how you have no influence on Ryder's personality. You have dialogue option, which almost never are an accurate representation of what Ryder's actually going to say. it's really annoying whenever you get 4 dialogue options and all are basically the same thing, just with a different tone. Also, forced weakens is something you will encounter, where you are absolutely destroying the enemy and Ryder says something along the lines of ""We can't last much longer"" meanwhile you are all at max health and blasting away.

5: Difficulty means nothing: Do [u] YOU [/u] like shooting at sponges? Do [u] YOU [/u] like wasting 100 bullets on every basic bitch enemy you encounter? Then crank this shit up to insanity and have fun shooting the same fucking grunt for hours. Because the only way to do difficulty is apparently to just give enemies a fuck ton of health and call it a day.

6: Multiplayer: The multiplayer in itself is fun, but too repetitive and you have to buy loot boxes to get any character that's not a basic bitch human (it is an EA game after all)

Overall I'd say that Mass Effect: Andromeda is an enjoyable game with fun characters, good combat and good world building/story. Sure, the cons outnumber the pros but the cons are also much less significant to the overall experience (most of the time). There are your usual bugs but they are few and far between. I do have an idea for why the game got so much hate when it first launched. Apart from the fact that the facial animation are dog shit tier, you can find better character creation on games from the 2000's and to my understanding, there where a lot more bugs. I think the game got a lot of flak because it's a Mass Effect game. Mass Effect (even though I have never played the original trilogy) is a game franchise heralded by many as one of [u] THE [/u] best games ever made. People have been waiting a long time for a sequel to the original story, and instead they got a game that has nothing to do with the original story or characters whatsoever. Ergo people got pissed, which is completely understandable. If a sequel to one of your favourite games came out, and it was only mildly good, you'd be pissed, and understandably so. I do believe though, that this game is worth experiencing HOWEVER, only on a discount. I do not think that it's worth the asking price.

That said, I bought it in a Steam sale just recently (mid-2021), and it seems like most of the show-stopping bugs have been addressed. 

This game really shines. I love the new setting and the world building, there are several really great characters, there's lots to do and explore, and they really convey a sense of urgency with your situation and import with your actions. There are some genuinely tough choices to be made that feel important, and the story is engaging.

I paid ten bucks for this game, and I played it for 97 hours to complete it. Moreover, I'm still excited and having tons of fun, playing it hours each day. That says a lot. I'll likely play a little more post-completion to mop some stuff up and just explore a little more.

I don't know if there's really any chance of them picking up this world again. There were definite hooks for a sequel. I'd love to see it get done, but it seems unlikely in the extreme. But this one is a full game unto itself that's well worth playing.

Also, hot take of the day: I like Ryder better than Sheppard, and that says a lot, because Sheppard kicked ass. :) 

I will very openly admit that while the SHOW STOPPING bugs seem to be gone (or at least didn't affect me), it's not completely bug free. Especially toward the end of the game, I saw plenty of buggy behaviour. But it's not really like, ""This is unforgiveably broken,"" so much as, ""What is this, Bethesda?"" Expect to get stuck on terrain, see enemies clipped through objects, have characters or objects disappear, etc. Not a LOT, but you'll definitely run into it. The very worst cases at most required me to fast travel to get unstuck or to reload my game to have a plot character reappear.

the open world itself though is a bit too empty, and the repetitive side quests don't really help with that. most of the characters are pretty cool with the exception of a few dull ones. can't really judge too harshly seeing as how there was meant to be continuations to the andromeda series.

Now, 4 years later, it's a mostly-not-broken, mostly-playable, less hilarious mess. 

The goofy animations are gone- but there are still scenes where you drink from a cup that isn't there, or clip through npcs in cut scenes. 

I didn't have any technical issues- on my specific system with my specific hardware playing this in 2021, there were no crashes, locks, or game breaking glitches. A few times my drone accompanied me back onto the ship because combat ended with a cutscene and it didn't reset. A few times notification text got stuck on the screen rather than fading away. 

The real tragedy is the many, many holes in the narrative. Not just logic holes, but actual parts where there was probably supposed to be an additional step in the quest with an additional cutscene that would bridge the gap between one part of the quest and another- that wasn't there. Either because they ran out of time, or they just forgot about it, or maybe it was glitched out and they just stripped it out rather than fix it. This happened quite a bit, and I was often left trying to figure out what the hell happened from context after completing a quest. 

That's only the beginning of the narrative issues. NPCs that I had never talked to suddenly remember me from some quest that isn't actually in the game, or I didn't trigger before meeting them. Dialog options lead to further dialog branches that make no sense in context, or worse, launch cutscenes that also don't make any sense in context.

It's VERY clear that the developers ran out of time and had to just piece together whatever they had finished, however they could- and this leads to a very confusing story that overall ""works"" but often the pieces of it don't make any sense. You can also tell where they started and where they finished, because parts of the game are fleshed out in exacting detail, and others are rushed and inconsistent. 

The game took me around 80 hours to beat, and I only collected 52% of the possible cheevos. I have no desire to continue post-ending in order to 100% the cheevos. Hard pass. 

But it wasn't... terrible. Based on the issues around its release, I expected it to be pretty bad, but parts of it are actually really fun. They finally figured out the goddamn car, for instance. It only took a whole franchise dying to get the scifi space car right. You do run out of upgrades for the car almost immediately though. That kind of sucks.

This isn't really much like the original mass effect trilogy. Instead, its a handful of vast, open world planets to do an ubisoft-style map of quests on. A couple worlds with very small, more linear areas. And a whole lot of useless planets to scan for 50 iron or whatever. 

It was alright. I guess I recommend it, if you don't mind trying to figure out what the hell happened in the quest you just finished based on post quest codex entries. 

There are some small things that are irritating: 

- The map compass highlights every point of a quest, all at once, and frequently without distance markers, so good luck figuring out which one is closest to you without constantly checking the map. 
- A lot of the quests are super generic ""scan a thing"" or ""kill a thing"" templates. About what you would expect in an open world ""live service"" game. These get really old really fast. Especially they start reusing enemy bases and areas you've already cleared out for later quests.
- There is very obviously a ""best"" suit of armor, and once you craft it, you are now done with armor. The weapons are a little less definite- there are a lot of sidegrades and combat style choices there. There are also a lot of terrible crap that nobody would ever use for any reason. It makes it look like you have a whole bunch of equipment options to choose from when you see the list, but that is a terrible lie.",1624580280,1624580280,True,69,2,0.855616986751556396,0,True,False,False

There is a lot to cover in this review. This game has so many issues but also positives going for it that it’s hard to not write an entire essay.

[b]The Premise of Andromeda[/b]
We start back in 2012, Bioware had written themselves into a corner with the final choice and ending of the original ME trilogy. Aside from the fact that the final choice of the trilogy created a lot of hate and community backlash, the ending also resulted in completely different world states. No matter what kind of sequel Bioware would make, the amount of work they would have to do to respect every player's choice would be astronomical. One might wonder why they didn’t just canonize one of endings and then made a follow-up game based off of that ending, right?

Anyway, Bioware decided not to create a sequel, or even a prequel, but to just abandon the entire Milky Way galaxy and set their eyes on the one next door. Andromeda. Looking for a clean sheet so they can avoid having to answer the questions they don’t want to answer.

The story starts around the time where Mass Effect 1’s story ends. A successful human billionaire and her mysterious financial backer started a project called The Andromeda Initiative. A huge multispecies project where arcs get send through dark space towards Andromeda in an attempt to peacefully colonize “Golden Worlds”.
You play as one of the two Ryder siblings and gain through story events the title of “Pathfinder”. A rank/position within the Initiative that is responsible for exploring the Heleus cluster in Andromeda in search of habitable planets.
However upon arrival in Andromeda and waking up from your cryosleep the human arc hits an anomaly in space. Aside from encountering this strange phenomenon you also come across a hostile alien species that have their own plans for the Heleus cluster.
Together with a new group of companions you must now find planets and make them habitable by using abandoned alien technologies that are present on these planets. Eventually you create allies throughout the cluster, set up colonies, build relationships with your crew and make a name for yourself. 

[b]Combat[/b]
Combat in Andromeda is at a higher pace and with a lot more freedom than in the previous titles. This however means that many of the combat encounters have become stale. Most fights in outdoor areas have the same setup and places of cover. While the Indoor fights are less fleshed out than the ones in the original trilogy. It's not per se bad, it's just less detailed.
There is now a great emphasis on flanking and elevation.

Bioware also removed features from the command system in the original trilogy. You can still order your companions around but no longer are you able to tell them when and where to use their abilities. This makes combining abilities to create combo's a lot harder and forces you to adopt a ""Jack of All Trades"" kind of character. Going pure tech, soldier or biotic is less recommended since you're more dependent on you companions' abilities.

[b]Exploration[/b]
This game focuses a lot more on exploration. Just like ME 1 you receive a rover style vehicle (Without weapons this time) that you can use to explore planets. In essence, the exploration is fun. However, uninteresting quests, repeating combat encounters and a rover that struggles climbing a small hill sometimes makes it boring. Luckily you can discover mobile spawn points that you can use for fast travel.

[b]World Building[/b]
Most of the worlds are beautifull and have their unique problems and eco system. However, one thing bothered me to no end. Each and every habitable world has the same wildife, just only with different colors. You like dinosaurs? Well here are your dinosaurs in the desert, jungle, snow and acidic plains on different planets.
The world is also sometimes plagued by invisible objects.

[b]Conversations[/b]
Bioware thought that players should be less obsessed with choosing for a certain “good or evil” choise and instead give them the ability to decide in what way Ryder would speak. 
The basic Paragon and Renegade options in conversatons are gone and have made way for deciding between “Casual – Professional” and/or “Emotional – Logical”. And to be honest, I can see what they tried to do…But it completely fails. Instead of players deciding WHAT Ryder says. Players have to decide HOW Ryder will say something. This means that you can no longer decide a lot of things. Your character will say the same thing whether he/she is casual, professional, emotional or logical. It is all the same answer with just a difference in tone. This means that a lot of control over the storyline is taken away from the player. Where Shepard in the originals could influence an NPC greatly with a renegade or paragon answer, here, Ryder is only allowed to decide what the tone of his/her reaction is.
This also meant that I often disagreed with Ryder but because I could not decide WHAT she would say, She often dealt in absolutes. Black or white. There were no gray options that I could've chosen. And when there were gray choices then the black or white choices were absent.

[b]The Rest[/b]
I'm running close to reaching the max character count for reviews so i'll just make this short.

[u]Companions and Ship crew[/u]  Most of them are awesome except Natalie Dormer's character. She has a copy/paste ugly Asari Face and the least interesting dialogue. Money spent on her voice could've gone to better places.

[u]Quest[/u] Most quests suck. A lot of button pressing and fetching to do. Only a couple of memorable sidequests. Main quest is decent, Final mission is awesome, Loyalty quests are decent, Movie Night quest best sidequest in my opinion.

[u]Graphics[/u] Graphics are beautifull. Character faces, not so. Animations have been fixed a bit but still not perfect. Overwhelming lack of facial and body animations in conversations.

[u]UI[/u] Fucking terrible, please change it. Feels like a cheap console port.

[u]Stability[/u] Can lag in tight spaces and had multiple crashes. Autosave also became corrupt at certain moments (dependent on what planet I was).

[b]Conclusion[/b]
So this review feels really negative when I read it. But I’m giving it an thumbs up…Why?
Well like they say. The most judgmental people are sometimes the ones closest to you. They want to see you grow, be successful and do great things. Call it tough love or whatever.
Even though all of the problems I encountered, even though all the crashes, bad animations and crazy writing errors I still liked it. And it’s also a decent length game. It took me 90 hours to complete the main game and nearly all sidequests. I’ve discovered 95% of the galaxy and I only have a few trivial fetch quests left that have no impact on the story or are broken.

Also most of these problems are, I think, because of EA. The game feels rushed. If EA could just stop being such a dick of a company and had given Bioware maybe some more time and/or resources then this game could have been way better.
Did the game deserve the backlash that it got? Yes, definitely. A Mass Effect game should be better than this and it’s a good way to shake up EA. If people had been fine with it than the next Mass Effect would probably be even worse. I’m not saying every Mass Effect has to be a resounding success. But I do think that it should at least be a quality and polished gaming experience.
Is this a great game? No, however it is a good game and was worth the 15 euro's I paid for it.

I had a lot of fun. There were no tears or any major emotional rollercoasters. But there are some heartfelt moments, some moments of genius and comedy. There was a lot of potential here but it never got to be what it was supposed to be.
However, with the backlash hype against this game being over, I think it’s time for people to seriously look at this game and not just mimic the things Youtubers say.

The characters and story in Andromeda are incredible, but for the best experience, go into the game with a different mindset than the ME trilogy. Andromeda is a story of exploration and discovery, NOT a war story, and the game plays like a modern version of the older style of Bioware RPGs, as opposed to the ME trilogy's far quicker paced cover-shooter style.

The story is SLOW at the start. You get one taste of action in the first mission and then you flatline for a few hours. I was used to missions introducing characters, the choice of whether or not they even join you, options where those characters can die or turn on you... but this game did not have that...or if it did, I didn't encounter it. The second bit I noticed was the characters were pretty dry with personalities. Lots of stereotypes... Cora is your tough chick (admission: with a refreshing feminine side), Liam is the token black guy (with the best ""fun"" mission in the game), PeeBee (worst nickname in the game) is your rebel girl/free spirit with an interest in tech, and Drack (the Krogan)... well, he's a Krogan. None of these characters interested me in the slightest. It wasn't that they were boring or bad characters (PeeBee was my love interest for Ryder), but nothing about them screamed originality. However, Vetra and Jaal were 2 of my favorites hands down. Both very original in character, development, and design. Jaal had the best jokes, side dialogues, and character arc; and Vetra had a definable story arc involving family, her job, and her struggle with playing both sides of the fence. I just don't feel like the other characters were given the same love. Content wise, the game was decent. My one issue was that damn-near everything was marked on the map. There was little to no cause to explore some of the vast areas of each planet. I 100%'d every planet in my playthrough and due to some decent fast-travel points, didn't feel wasteful or tedious in the process. The 2nd half of the game was infinitely better than the 1st. I could feel the pressure of why the initiative needed to act, the impact it had on each character and Ryder, and the final mission was very well done. Kudos to the team that designed the final mission! The ending left it open for more content (that I found out isn't coming)... but was still done in a good way. Finally, I played the game on hardcore and still felt it a little easy.
PROS
Fun gameplay, great music, good overall story, big worlds, decent character development
CONS
Item/crafting system, Facial expressions, weak character development for some, enemy variety, slow start, only 3 skills at a time, weak choice impact.",1624471445,1624471445,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But some things are terrible such as facial animations often look weird, unnatural  and also cut scenes when you land and take off that you can't skip is really annoying. It does seem like an unprofessional game at times, it makes me wonder did they let their kids work on this game? And what happened to really good writing, story and interesting characters? It also seems like it's written by amateurs.
It also has weird glitches as in characters arms froze in a weird pose and Ryder drinks from an invisible glass at the bar.

The story is alright, nothing amazing. The story lacks meaningful depth and choices. Ryder is so one dimensional you can't even be a renegade.
The characters are mostly forgettable. 

I enjoy the combat in the game. It feels like they were trying to make a good FPS game and failed on making a good RPG with depth and choices that truly effect outcomes.
I also like exploring and discovering things. It looks amazing and fills me with a feeling of wonder and I do feel like Iam a Pathfinder. 
A open world is great if they can make it full of interesting things as in meaningful side quests, but unfortunately it's full of mindlessly boring empty fetch quests. The side quest Tasks are the worst which are all very simular to each other such as have to find and scan 3 bodies that randomly appear at scavenger camps then get final location to go to or another is find 3 data pads then go to a final location. It leads to a lot of driving around as these bodies and other items appear randomly and have no quest markers for them. I got really sick of those side quests so stopped doing those as they only vary slightly as in just have to scan something different and drive around for ages trying to find them. I hate when they lack imagination for quests and just fill it with mindlessly boring quests that ad nothing but tedium.

Character creation doesn't seem to have many options. Can't even choose custom hair colour and if you choose any hair colour besides brown or black it looks like she has dark roots.

I still like and enjoy playing this game. The game play  is mostly fun and enjoyable. 
It had a nice solid game ending. Though it would of been nice to have choices that dramatically effect outcomes in the story resulting in various endings instead of just one.

I recommend the game as I enjoyed playing it mostly and would rate it 6/10 as game doesn't seem like it's made by professionals and it's lacking as a  good RPG.",1624176278,1624176278,True,2,0,0.504352867603302002,0,True,False,False

The combat system has changed into a profile and individual skill focus as compared to the trilogy's class based system which is an interesting development. Unfortunately in this game you aren't able to issue orders for your squad mates to use a specific skill like in the previous versions.

I was having enough fun to go ahead and buy it on Steam though. I clearly think the game is worth $30, but it goes on sale often so waiting might be a good option.

I recently played original trilogy in the legendary edition and I can say Andromeda feels good to play after going through those games. The combat feels much better and the exploration is a nice change of pace compared to the linear mission design of the first three. While I do enjoy linear mission design going through the first three games made me ready for something more open ended.

The story has been good. I'm invested in learning more about Andromeda. The characters are pretty good too but there are lines of dialogue that feel like they needed more editing. The writers who worked on this are clearly talented but there is seemingly rough draft material that made it into the game. I'm guessing they didn't have time to back and rework scenes that needed it.

In the end it's pretty sad that EA ruined this game by rushing it out before it was ready and then abandoning it. If it hadn't been rushed and had been worked on after release to fix the issues and expand the content it would have been amazing. I don't know what they were thinking not investing in one of their most popular IP's and ruining it's reputation.

Original kept for context:
So just a heads up that this is a straight port from origin and you have to have origin installed for this to work correctly otherwise you are likely to run into bugs or glitches, hence why I gave it a negative recommendation. If the game ran straight away, out of the box, with no troubleshooting needed it might have changed the outcome of the review, but sadly i spent most of the first hour trying to get the thing to run. 

On initial launch ME:A would not run, after verifying files it still would not run. Troubleshooting the issues suggested adding the game to the Origin library but jokes, you need a valid CD key in order to register the product which steam does not give you until after the first initial launch of new or non-legacy titles so that was a bust. After verifying the game files AGAIN and a system restart the game managed to finally launch but only with Origin running in the background (the game actually launches through Origin and uses the Origin overlay so just be aware of that). I almost requested a refund on the launch issue alone, it's 2020 products should launch regardless of the store you buy them from IMO. 

Other than the awful technical issues the game is fine I suppose. The graphics aren't really anything to lose your mind over and the story is meh and not really engaging (the game still seems poorly optimised and I had to turn down some settings to get a stable framerate, there were times in just the first few rooms that tanked the frame rate purely based on the direction your character was looking which is weird...). 
Edit: Since posting this I have had one crash to desktop and two occasions where the sound just stopped working in a loading transition.

The new conversation system seems to be confusing and poorly explained (the game implies that a casual response is the opposite of a professional response even though they are ultimately the same intent in terms of character building and context. The shooting aspect of the game seems fun enough for the most part and might be what get's me to engage with the storyline and character development. 

The gameplay is fine, the UI is wonky and the storyline is not really compelling, it pushes the player along but it's so easy to get buried in meaningless busy work. I have had some fun though so there's that. All of the technical issues are what turn this from a positive to a negative though.

An ""awesome"" and ""unremarkable"" game! It has many amazing features such as:
* FETCH QUESTS – a ton of them! You just left a planet? There is a reason to come back imidatiely just to talk to a random guy and tell his girlfriend he's in prison! Such a fine mission for a pathfinder!
* POOR LEVEL SCALING – as discussed on forums it has been found out that the more You level up, the more spongy enemies get, which is fine, but combine that with crafting and augumentations and from headshoting enemies with one shot, You'll go to having to headshot them three times. So fun!
* LOADING SCREENS – The game features HOURS of staring at loading screens, to which glorious fetch quests design contributes a lot. You finished a quest? go to the TEMPEST for a call, oh You just finished watching a minute of LOADING animations to see the call, go back to the planet! So much regard to the players time!
* CRAFTING SYSTEM – want a weapon to mimic another weapon or construct already available weapons? Fret not! The crafting system's got You. You can exchange almost any stat for another stat, so if You want to give space with lack of weapon damage to your abilities, You can do that! So much fun from doing more things just as efficient as the previous one!
* PREDICTIVE STORY LINE – just another story line, which features choices, which lead to different personality options, which don't do anything at all, just as You like it. And again You can develop better endings by embracing THE GRIND! Want the factions to like You? Do a thousand of fetch quest, or no wait a minute so You can do some more fetch quests first!
* SCALED LOOT – Want another leveled weapon that does exactly the same as the one You have? dont fret, You can hunt cashes to get new weapons and armor, most of which are as useful as Your pet that You can capture!
* TOLERANCE PROPAGANDA – You missed being told how much of a bigot You were for having opinions? Don't worry, the game will force theirs down Your throat anyway, so You don't have to think for Your own!

Honestly I can see why I haven't seen many gameplays of the game. The setting had so much potential and it was destroyed by attempts to make the game longer and give the ""better bang for the buck"". I bet there will be some Mass Effect fanatics, that will enjoy the endless hours of gameplay and grind, but seriously... Don't waste Your time if You're not one of them.

I'm giving up on completing the game. I can rush the objective and get mediocre ending, but what's the point. I'll just watch the game being played by something else and use the power of scrolling the videos to waste less hours of my life.

The character creator is pretty limited, but it's good anyways. Driving the Nomad was very, very fun.

Full review;
I avoid this game for so long because of the bad press it received but when it's on sale for RM30 (about 7USD), it's too hard to pass. I'm a big fan of the original trilogy and the series is my favourite game of all time. I'm a bit worried that this game will be a huge disappointment to me. But after playing for a few hours, I was hooked. Sure it has shortcomings like the notoriously bad facial animations, floating enemy bugs, characters just T-posing in cutscenes and tons of forgettable tasks and side quests. But it has many good things too. The best thing about this game is the combat and character skill building. We're no longer restricted to a set of skills that comes with the class we chose. We're now free to choose and level up any skills we desire depending on our playstyle. Instead of classes now we have profiles, a system that determines what bonuses we receive to the combat, tech or biotics. Combat also spiced up with combos. Combos works with your own powers or you can trigger it with a squad mate's primer. We also spoiled for choice when it comes to guns, even melee weapons have a good variety. Throughout a playthrough we can have tons of different combat playstyle weather you want to be an aggressive biotic who charges directly into enemies and finishing them with a shotgun or melee. Or a tech expert with tons of cool gadgets such as sentry guns, robotic drones, and fire or ice beam shooting from your hand.

The graphics also very beautiful and detailed. But this depends if your hardware can handle the high graphics though. The outer space and planets looks very surreal and it makes you really feel like you're exploring a whole new galaxy when you're travelling from a star system to another. The explorable worlds also looks great and you have different terrains to experience such as a dessert, snowy or tropical planet. The exploration bit also more exiting than the trilogy since it doesn't feel as linear and more open. However I found that the variety of flora and fauna is little bit lacking.

For the story, what I can say without spoilers is it's original and enjoyable albeit some aspect seems to be too generic, boring and poorly explained.  [spoiler] Even some of your decision making in the game doesn't really change anything in a significant way, this is my biggest disappointment.[/spoiler] But the story has it fair share of surprises, sad moments, plot twists and humor. Surely it fell short when compared to the trilogy but this is a new standalone game so I can forgive some of the shortcomings. 

For characters, I have a mixed feeling towards them. Some are fun and interesting. Their stories and banters are really fun to watch. But parts of them are poorly written. Some squadmates even made outright stupid decisions in the story and get mad when your decision doesn't favour them. For romance options, you have quite diverse option to choose. You can romance squadmates or peoples outside your crew. The romance storyline seems shallow however, maybe because time is a factor. Since this is a single game instead of a trilogy. Maybe we can continue the romance path should this game get a sequel. Just be aware of the 'lock-in' moments because once you are locked-in with someone, you can't continue a romance with someone else.

Overall this game is good if you can look past the negative things. Does it have many flaws that the developers doesn't bother to fix after all these years? Yes. But am I still enjoying the hell out of it? Also Yes! Also IMO it is not worth it to pay the full price so wait for a discount. I give it a 6.5 out of 10.

Love they way the talk to each other throughout the game.

Good tips I would recommend to all new players are; stay away from most of the task missions as most of them are really boring. You can do side-mission even though you've finished the main path, so try to mix it up, so you get a good amount of the good stuff in between missions.

Now that is on steam since 2020 majority of the reviews are positive. It doesn't deserve the hate and hesitation it gets. I mean it has andromeda in the name. That is a real life galaxy that is the closest neighboring galaxy to the milky way. Bioware was going with something new for mass effect. Just because it doesn't take place in the milky way doesnt mean it is not apart of the mass effect universe. The maps of the planets you explore are absolutely massive compared to mass effect 1, 2, and 3 planet maps. The main story is shorter than the other mass effect games because the game focuses on exploration. The amount of planets you can scan in andromeda are practically double of any total amount of planets in mass effect 1, 2, and 3. There are way more side quests than mass effect 1 and 2. You interact personally with your companions a lot more as well. However you are given majority of your companions right at the start of the game unlike mass effect 1,2, and 3 but they are ok. Romance wise, the best romance for female Ryder I think is Jaal and the best romance for male Ryder is PeeBee. The game introduces 2 new enemies and 1 new ally species. The new enemies are the Kett and the Remnant. I will avoid plot spoilers in this review for new people. The new ally species is called the angaran. They are interesting to say in the least. Sorry there are no Geth, Quarian, Hanar, or Volus in this game as the game was never truly finished or dlc added as they planned because the team was moved over to anthem. The amount of time up to this review for me is about 60 hours. I did this game on insanity mode for my first playthrough while doing every side quest I possibly could. I am going to do my 2nd and 3rd playthrough normally to get all the achievements. For those who are new like me and possibly got interested in this game because of the mass effect legendary edition. Welcome aboard. Glad to have you in the community. As some of you may know the initial launch of this game was not received well because of how different it was from the trilogy. But being different is not bad at all. It is a great game. There is only one thing I hate about it, and that is the team did not fully patch the game as the game crashes every so often for no reason at all and gives your a directx error on pc. But besides that I have really enjoyed the game. What I liked most was the amount of exploration there was in the game. I played no mans sky for the longest time on ps4 and andromeda reminded me of that game because of the exploration. There are plenty of side quests to do. Also I think the reason why so many people didn't like the game at launch is that they never truly explored the game to its fullest potential. You are a pathfinder in this game, an explorer. It is all about discovery and exploration. The game is only as good as you make it. So do everything. And I mean everything. And when you finish check out the multiplayer. There are still people that actively play it. I really wish this game would get a big patch and some dlc. It hasnt gotten anything for four years since launch. Long overdue. But it is a fantastic.

The most obvious weak point of the game is the main story which feels like a remix of various elements of ME 1,2 and 3. Ancient advanced race that left mysteries all over the galaxy: check. Evil alien race that is bent on destroying and harvesting the other races: check. Protagonist who is special because they're the only one who can interface with the ancient tech: check. 
The main story plays out as a pretty standard ""stop the bad guy"" plot that hints at something bigger beyond, but the enemy aliens, the kett, are rather dull and uninteresting - mostly evil for evil's sake with very little variation. I can definitely say it's the worst main story in a Mass Effect game, but that doesn't mean it's outright bad - I even enjoyed it quite a bit myself - it's just a bit of a letdown.

There's a lot that's good about the game though: the gameplay is extremely fun (if you've never used biotic Charge it's the best power in the game go and use it), the characters are memorable and each of them have a lot of memorable moments though some more than others, a lot of the bigger bits of side content are fun and bring in some extra flavour to the Andromeda Galaxy. What I am trying to say is that basically everything besides the main story is pretty good, even very good (Drack is one of the best companions in the series).

Speaking of gameplay, why in the name of the goddess did they decide that 3 skill slots was enough? It is most definitely not when there's a quadrillion active skills you can use! ""Oh but you can switch profiles on the go and basically have 12 skill slots"" - no you can't because switching profiles puts all your skills on cooldown! Why? By the time they go off cooldown the fight is over most of the time. There's no point in switching!
I tried to make the profile system work, and with some sweat and elbow grease I did, but I almost always fell back on a comfort profile that could get me through any fight no problem (thank you biotic charge). I shouldn't have to work more when using the system, it shouldn't be a burden, switching profiles to use different skills should be a thing that I do seemlessly just because it is the best option for a given situation.

Overall it's still a bit janky when it comes to animations and overall ""smoothness"" (whatever that means), and it seems to love wasting your time in the galaxy map menu for some ungodly reason, and the Nomad sections are plainly filler (though the crew conversations make it fun) but there's a diamond (or maybe a gem that's worth slightly less than a diamond) in there.

If you can get it for a discount I recommend playing through this one at least once. It's a very clean EA game with no microtransactions and no time wasters aside from travelling on the galaxy map - it took me about 55 hours to do around 90% completion, but you can get away with less if you don't care to planet hop 50 times for one small sidequest that doesn't matter.

The combat and character building is the only redeeming quality this game has. Unfortunately most fights are just one wave of 5-8 enemies and its over so pretty boring in the end. Exploration is just large empty open areas with nothing note worthy of seeing. The intel (data pads) are really boring to read. This game has you running from point A to B and back to A only to tell you to go back to B... really annoying. The characters mostly suck except for Peebee and Suvi.

This was a game made not by the flagship BioWare team (they were working on [i]Anthem[/i] at the time), but by BioWare Montreal—the team primarily responsible for [i]Mass Effect 3[/i]'s phenomenal multiplayer component. 

Going off of that, you can expect really good combat. [i]Andromeda[/i] is easily the best a [i]Mass Effect[/i] game has ever played, combat-wise. You are far more mobile than ever before thanks to jump-jets, there are more powers to choose from in your build than ever before, and guns feel almost universally exceptional. They even fixed the original trilogy's notoriously awful vehicles by having [i]by far[/i] the best feeling, looking, and controlling vehicle in the entire series in the Nomad!

In addition to the strong combat, the move to the Frostbite engine (although it caused a severely difficult development, as Frostbite was not intended to be utilized for RPGs) looks absolutely beautiful in comparison to the Unreal Engine 3 which the previous games were built on. Perhaps most stunning about this game's visuals are the lighting and particle effects; the way light glows in space, reflects off of surfaces such as ice, and scatter due to particle effects such as fire and explosions is unequaled by any other game in the series. I would even make the claim that space has never looked better in a video game than it does in [i]Mass Effect Andromeda[/i]—no exaggeration! Just check out these examples:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2514238286

Superb, right?

To top it off, this game [i]sounds[/i] [b]amazing[/b]! Sound design is something we don't typically notice much, but [i]Andromeda[/i] is one of the best sounding games I've ever played. Gunshots echo beautifully throughout the environment, every weapon has pop, the way biotics distort sounds is really impressive. The deadened sound of space is engulfing. Even the effects used for things like reloads or door switches sound really great. Top-notch sound design, and it really makes a difference in the gameplay.

There are some drawbacks to combat, though. BioWare Montreal chose to remove the pause-and-command features from the original trilogy, which is a huge disappointment. I'm sure they chose to play to their strengths—which are real-time—but the tactical aspect of pausing and assessing the situation was a huge feature that made [i]Mass Effect[/i] different from every other third-person shooter, and it feels more generic without it.

In addition to this, managing your squadmates loadouts and power usage is also gone, further removing the more tactical feel of the original trilogy.

Aside from these drawbacks, though, the game really does play wonderfully in combat. Being in the thick of it, causing biotic detonations and hearing the amazing gunfire makes combat a joy.

Unfortunately, though, the game's troubled development cycle and ragtag writers room have led to a disjointed, sub par writing effort.

One of my favorite things about the [i]Mass Effect[/i] series is its worldbuilding and its strong characters. The original trilogy feels so alive because its galaxy feels like a real place with real political squabbling and real conflict of cultures. The Batarians versus the humans, the Krogan versus the Turians and Salarians, etc. And its characters feel so real and lifelike that their conflicts ring true and really affect the way you view them and the norms of the setting. Sadly, this is not the case with [i]Andromeda[/i], which feels incredibly basic, tacky, and uninteresting by comparison. The entire setting feels so generically space opera that I find myself wholly uninterested with any of its lore.

This lack of writing quality sadly extends to its characters as well. Although I really liked Drack and Vetra, there were so many crewmates I absolutely detested that I refused to bring them with me in almost any situation. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2216320380]Peebee is little more than an impulsive moron[/url], whose flimsy loner personality feels completely artificial—she feels like a writer tried [i]really[/i] hard to give a ""character quirk"" rather than an actual person; which is what all good characters should feel like! And then you have Liam, who is basically just an obnoxious, impulsive screw-up. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2216485517]Liam is such a stupid idiot that it even seems like most of the rest of the team hates him as much as I do[/url]. Perhaps some of his hijinks were meant to endear him to me, I guess? If so, his writers completely failed on that front. I truly wished I had the option to kick him off the crew in-game, as he did nothing but act like a fool and consistently put everyone in terrible, life-threatening situations. And then you have people whose dialogue is just flat-out annoying, even at the best of times: an example being Gil, the mechanic. Go away, Gil. I'm tired of hearing your annoying, nasally voice and try-hard attempts at wit.

The entire game is permeated with unbelievably poor dialogue, too. Characters say things that feel awkward and completely unrealistic. Every time I sit down to play this game, I think to myself, ""This isn't how people talk! Nobody would say things like this!"" None of the writing feels natural or real. The characters feel like video game characters, the world feels like a video game world. And so none of the conflicts or the ideas this game feebly attempts to discuss are interesting at all. They're just busywork; something that's in place because it's a [i]Mass Effect[/i] game, and [i]Mass Effect[/i] games need to have things like squadmates and aliens. The writing in general is so uninspired that I've never replayed this game—even though [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/greatjon_umber/recommended/1238020/]I've replayed [i]Mass Effect 3[/i] a dozen times at this point[/url]. It's so, so disappointing to see from my all-time favorite video game series.

In addition to this, the quest design really leaves a lot to be desired. There are far too many busywork fetch quests here. BioWare Montreal designed these gorgeous, huge, atmospheric environments which feel amazing to look at and fight in, and then chose to populate them with some of the most mundane, uninteresting busywork crap-quests imagineable. Get ready to scan 32 plants, mine 26 rocks, kill 10 beasts, etc. Over and over. Ad nauseam. Because, unfortunately, [i]Mass Effect Andromeda[/i] is that kind of game.

It's really unfortunate that the poor animations (they are bad, but they're nowhere near the biggest flaw this game has) got so much press at the time of release, because, in general, this game really does look excellent. And its biggest flaw—by far—is how it fails the series' reputation by putting together such a mediocre writing effort.

If you're looking for a fun third-person sci-fi shooter with some nice visuals, give [i]Andromeda[/i] a shot. That being said, although [i]Mass Effect Andromeda[/i] does indeed do some really great things, I still don't think I would recommend it unless you're a very hardcore fan of the series. And even then, it's important to go in with well-managed expectations: [i]Mass Effect Andromeda[/i] is certainly not a great game, but, depending on your tastes, it can be an enjoyable experience.

[code]I wrote an emotional letter to the Mass Effect trilogy some years ago, check on this Steam link [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/cybergothika/recommended/17460] a review for my favorite series ever.[/url] and this is how they pay my love for it; I had to buy ME:A so you don’t have to.[/code]

[h1][b]Half a dozen things no FAN should accept[/b][/h1] 

I was so hopeful for 2017 but I couldn’t play it much, returning years later I noticed it has been severely tweaked. Ugly scenes were deleted and I guess the main artery of facial animation algorithm was cut down. The game still starts strong, like a heart bomb, a known trait of the series. Then there is no support for ultra-wide monitors during cutscenes, dumb stuff like blinding you after closing the map and bugs starts to accumulate, slowly rendering the game unbearable.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2313161786
[olist][*]The enemy A.I. is terrible, only higher difficulty helps it a little. For some reason 💲💵
💲 PvE got a much better A.I. almost too tough to beat.

[*]Dialog wheels often go nowhere. The story has a indescribable boring flow only worsened by terrible dialogues. There is no paragon and no renegade actions either. (maybe a very rare ‘’kill him’’ moment)

[*]Game is clearly trying to mimic previous Mass Effect moments and it is very goofy at that. Maybe if it wasn’t for that, the story could have been better. It almost looks like the new staff hates it. 

[*]90% of the time the orbit scanning is pointless. Space navigation looks dull, there is no bridge camera option, they even call it “Galaxy Map” when in reality it is just a single star cluster.

[*]Multiplayer got the microtransaction casino gambling, killing honest progression the multiplayer part could have had. At least MP is lore friendly and not mandatory.

[*]Every time I see a plot hole in there, it is insulting and breaks my heart. Plot holes are mixed with disgusting fan service especially with timelines rewriting the base lore.[/olist]

Note: This review isn’t about March 21, 2017, some things have changed since then, but as you can see, most of it is damaged beyond repair. I finished the original trilogy countless times, and they’re from 2007 to 2012, ME:A is inferior to its predecessors to the extreme. 

[b]Important fan note:[/b] Game is a shameless step-by-step ME1 reenactment. The ancient lost civilization again, the Asari archeologist to recruit, the funny old Krogan, Peak-15 snow mission, big space station, even the interview after returning from the first mission and giant cyber monsters. This game lacks the soul it is trying to mimic though. Not even the staff roll music was spared, not even the Geth. The enemy now is the “Kett”. Sounds similar.

The ultimate bad move was a Mass Effect without the Quarians. You don’t do that. It’s like Star Wars without the Togruta.

[h1][b]What newcomers should expect[/b][/h1]

One can say the game is okay for the fresh meat, people unaware of previous games, but the story certainly won’t attract any star gazers. It’s just generic Netflix sci-fi but the problem is the boredom. The Angarans first contact makes you feel like a real alien, but they’re not really interesting after that, so that’s a perfect resume for the game. Everything good is immediately killed by embarrassing low-effort stuff. Any fan-fiction could have written the story a hundred times better than this, free of charge.

One of their cities is called ‘’Estraaja’’, just like “Australia'' with the accent and everything. This is the kind of creative poop running there. Lots of double vowels and double consonants trying to look alien. Ex: estrAAja and keTT and elAAden and havaRL doesn’t sound alien to me. I doubt a non-fan would enjoy that, if not I can’t help but to facepalm. This isn’t just a bad game for fans, it is genuinely an annoying game.

[code][b]Writing Lesson Number 1:[/b] In a different galaxy far away from the original lore, you need to create something ultra foreign so your audience can feel outta place; Masochist neon light aliens, translucent green flying chimps, invisible false gods beings and hermaphrodite snakes in the iron age, whatever, just be creative. But Bioware came up with the Angara and Kett instead.[/code]

[h1][b]12 broken good things[/b][/h1]

[olist][*]Combat is excellent and almost saves the game. The PvE horde mode survived and still is fun despite all the “surprise $$$ mechanics”.

[*]If you enjoy reading, this is the first game besides Elder Scrolls that I truly enjoy reading random stuff. Why are data-pads better written than dialogues?

[*]The open worlds aren't that bad, exploration hazards make you feel the colonist hardship but the distribution and conclusion of random quests are vague.

[*]Exploration can be really exciting on some worlds, mainly the desert one. The downside is the lack of a mini-map, it's a pain to keep mission tracking and compass isn’t exactly practical either. 

[*]I like the comedic side of the game, it never overplays it. Some few characters have good moments, but there is always something slow or weak breaking them.

[*]Taking cover is adaptive, like it was with ME1 there is no button assigned for that. Oddly, you’re forced to swap sides manually.

[*]Graphics looks nicer when you’re not running it on an ultra wide monitor. It hasn’t aged as well as DA: Inquisition has. Havarl, the purple world is beautiful enough but the map is really small.

[*]Your character class isn’t exactly mandatory, you can rewrite or remix them so that’s good. 

[*]New weapons are inferior in design, but the old ones still rock. Inventory is very confusing but you learn to navigate eventually. Holster animation is too fast and [b]thermal clip is now called “ammo”.[/b]

[*]Biotics and tech are now a perfected version of ME2’s where the squad mates could perform satisfying combos. Even better on PvE.

[*]Music is generic. You can barely hear it in-game by default, you have to tweak for cinema range. Were they trying to hide it? It used to play a major role in the past.

[*]Sometimes the real Mass Effect almost comes alive during good moments (frequently squandered by being too distant from one another.)[/olist]

Do you know a band called [b]Mechina[/b]? Search for The Horizon Effect on youtube.It isn’t that hard to find talented indie composers for your games, they’re everywhere you just need to pick one and hire them. Better than some out-of-touch Netflix composer.

I have tried to play this game since it was released numerous times and just couldn’t get into it. After putting 110 hours into the Mass Effect Legendary Edition recently, I decided it was finally time to blow through it. After 40 hours I can say that the game is more enjoyable than I first realized, but also has more flaws than I imagined. Most of the major visual bugs are patched out at this point, but what remains is the core game that can never change or improve without an actual sequel.

I love the premise of Andromeda. The game takes place 600 years after the events of the original trilogy and that’s because a private company sent every species known to Council space out on several arks to the Andromeda galaxy and establish lives on then discovered “golden worlds”. Everyone stays in cryostasis while an illegal AI named SAM watched over all the arks. You play as Ryder who wakes up to the human ark being hit by something called the Scourge. This is a space phenomenon that honestly is never really explored or explained in the game. Strange tendrils reach out and destroy worlds and ships. Your brother also ends up in a coma as his pod was damaged during the incident.

This is where you learn the basic controls and how to interact with the world. The core ideas and gameplay loop of Mass Effect are intact. You can read datapads, talk to people for extra information and story, but in the end, your conversation choices make zero difference in the story. Whoops. I’ll get to that later. Once you finally try to explore the first golden world you realize it’s not. The Scourge changed it somehow and all the golden worlds are no longer habitable. This sense of fear is something I wish the game touched on more. Being lost and stranded in space with no way back home is a really great idea, but they never play upon this much. Once you land not the first planet you learn how to do everything else. Controlling Ryder is a breeze and the character is nimble, has a jetpack to jump around on ledges, can infinite sprint, and the shooting is more akin to standard third-person cover shooter gameplay, but barely.

Let’s go over the combat. Sadly, Mass Effect 3 had more satisfying combat than Andromeda. It plays well, but it’s very generic and just gets the job done. Once again, like in Mass Effect 1, there’s too much loot. Weapon mods, augmentations, armor, armor mods, minerals, random collectibles, etc. This means while each weapon looks unique, they don’t feel too unique. A shotgun feels like a shotgun, an assault rifle feels like an assault rifle. They just picked a center lane or each weapon type and stuck with that. Games like Gears of War have weapons that have their own unique personality. They are almost a character among themselves. At least in Mass Effect 3, the weapons had punch and weight to them, while these do not. The combat is mostly boring and the same enemies repeat forever. You have the kett, Remnant, and the usual raiders. The kett are the main enemy as you are trying to stop the Archon from using this Remnant tech to destroy worlds. More on that later. Then the Remnant is just generic boring robots. Each faction has different enemy types, but the game, in general, is pretty easy and I rarely ever died, even during boss fights. 

The biggest change in Andromeda is being able to explore actual planets. There are quite a few here and they are actually really fun to explore. There are many side missions that involve your crew, and there are tasks, but honestly just exploring and doing the main missions was the most fun I had in the game. The open maps feel like major filler and while the worlds look beautiful, and the new vehicle you get is much better to control and it can get upgrades, but no combat, it’s 90% filler. There are tasks you can complete, but most don’t have objective markers so you either have to wander around aimlessly looking for these or use a walkthrough. In the end, most missions don’t give you any rewards at all outside of XP. Unless you are a completionist there is zero reasons to stray outside of the main missions. This is really a bummer and most of Andromeda is just filler with no real rewards or pay-off. 

There are also way too many things to keep track of. AVP missions, R&D, buying and selling, modding, unlocking cryo pods teams to bonuses. It’s just too much. AVP missions are pointless as you just send teams out to complete missions for you. There’s a co-op multiplayer section tied in here, but why bother? The rewards out pointless. Andromeda tries to create an economy and ultimately fails as it doesn’t need one. The game is too easy, so most of the weapons are useless. Once you get a level five weapon your good. I had one of each weapon and the mods are nice, they actually do help, but this meant I never needed to buy anything after the second world was finished. I mostly collected too many minerals on missions that I just R&Ded the weapon I wanted and that was it. I needed research points to research the weapon and then I could develop it. I also found most rare weapons as loot. By the time I got the third and fourth world, I stopped caring about all that and ignored it. I just continued to level up. Another thing I don’t like is elemental ammo is now expendable and you need to acquire it as it’s limited. It was hard to keep track of when I was using it as there’s no sound or icon flashing that shows me when it’s gone. The icon just disappears.

So the main reason you explore these worlds is to establish a base and to clear each world’s hazardous conditions by activating three Remnant monoliths and then the vault. The monoliths sometimes require you to solve a sudoku-type puzzle using glyphs. Yep, I sighed at that too. At least it’s a real puzzle, but why do we need these? They just slowed the game down and some are insanely difficult. Once you get into the vault you activate consoles to get a path to the purifier console then run out as the gas chases you. You do this about six or seven times and it gets more boring as you complete each one. One thing I did like was seeing each race and how they fit into the Andromeda Initiative. It really feels like a reboot of the series while keeping the core of it intact, sometimes too intact.

That leads me to the main reason why most people felt so engrossed in the original trilogy: The choices. The dialogue is now split up into five emotions and the binary moral system is gone, but each choice doesn’t really do anything. The only thing you can really control is who you form a relationship with. There is so much dialog and so many choices, but they mean nothing in the end and that is one of the major problems with the game itself. I enjoyed the story itself, and the personalities and politics of the races remained intact and were in full force here, but my character was probably better off just not having any dialog choices. That would have been a bold new move rather than keep a system that is hollow in the end. And essentially that’s what Andromeda is. A bunch of systems from the trilogy that is either just there because it’s familiar and don’t do anything new, or is just there for no particular reason. This leads me to the Galaxy Map. BioWare just can’t get it right, even four games later. Sure, you are actually on a map this time and can zoom across the system and it’s pretty cool for the first few times, then you want to skip it after that. It’s slow and uninteresting after a while, and there’s no reason to explore most planets outside of reading their description. Sometimes you can launch a probe when Suvi announces an anomaly, but that’s it. So while the map is visually more impressive, it’s still pointless.

The visuals are outstanding as the game uses EA’s Frostbite engine, but the game is horribly optimized. Frame drops happened mostly in cut scenes and in random areas. Sometimes dropping into single digits.",1623326812,1623326812,True,2,0,0.530201315879821777,0,True,False,False

I think the weakest points about this game are the lack of true consequences whether good or bad, such as not completing a certain side quest having no actual impact on the story or gameplay whatsoever. There are no real moral choices to be made that will drastically change the story or make us feel a special way. It feels like whatever you pick during conversations will not have any impact big enough to really care. I mean even the last scene where you pick the representative of Meridian does not have any effect, apart from hearing funny comments from the other candidates. Also there are too many unnecessary side quests that are more like fillers just to squeeze in some extra content, quantity over quality in this case. For somebody new to the game it can become very overwhelming and might deter from giving the game a chance. And as said previously these little missions do not even matter, they're just there to fill the void. I would steer clear from wasting any time on these missions. The rather awkward  character animations and the extremely long door opening and ship landing sequences are so far the most annoying things about this game. But that is more of a technical issue,  and the latter can be fixed with some mods, nonetheless it's there and it's a little bothersome. And perhaps I should also mention the audio of this game is mediocre at best, I do not remember any significant soundtracks, like I did in Halo or even Skyrim. Not even remotely close. 
I think that is it for the cons, the lack of choices and consequences, too many meaningless side quests, and some technical annoyances.

Now let's get to the good things I found about this game. It sucks you right in. The story, I think it's great, at least compared to most AAA games. Although it is very linear I think it's quite good at what it is. Your father dies trying to discover new home, and is killed in the process by alien technology. Throughout the whole main story we are continuing in his steps, discovering and learning more of this technology and how it affects us and everything. We are looking for new home and this technology will help us find it. And the different villains, it's quite interesting to be honest. The story is by no means bad, but it could always be better. The visuals are mostly gorgeous. Every different planet that we can land on looks and feels unique. It makes us want to explore it. Only problem with that is there isn't much to be explored once we complete the main mission and perhaps the companion personal missions on that planet, there usually isn't much beneath the surface. What we see is what we get. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as we follow the main mission and once completed, onto the next planet. The combat feels great, it's no longer tactical like in the trilogy, and it's more action based. Dashing around, jumping onto platforms, shooting mid-air and plunging down on your enemies. It's quite fun. There is freedom to create your own build and use up to 3 different abilities, and then there are profiles. With that we can create pretty much any build we want. Melee, biotic mage, sniper or heavy gunner are one of the many builds we can create. I really enjoyed the freedom with weapons, armour bonuses, different skills and profiles, and the possibility to swap it on the go. The combat in this game justifies the inability to control your squadmates like you could in the previous titles, as combat is now fluid, very actiony and all up to you. Your squadmates are only there for slight bonuses. The biggest issue however that I found with Adromeda's combat is that all enemies will focus on you and completely forget about your partners. The AI is not the best here, and your partners aren't that much help anyway. The weapon crafting I found very much intriguing, and being able to put different bonuses in our crafted weapons and armour felt good, as we could complete our builds. I would have multiple sets of weapons and armours for different builds, for different occasions. Only problem I had with crafting is that the currency for it is quite scarce. It's called technology and you get it by scanning different objects, plants or creatures. After I began to upgrade all my schematics I realized I wasted a ton of these points and there was no way of getting it back, wish I had knew it before. Also the flirting system is there, not something I was particularly interested in but it works. You can flirt and create relationships with many important npcs including your squadmates. I'm sure some people will find it fun. It reminds me a lot the flirting system from DA: Inquisition (same makers).

To summarise the graphics are good, the combat is entertaining throughout the whole game, the exploration is fun as long as we don't plan on doing every single side quest as most of them are pointless. The story is relatively good. We can sleep around and forgot to mention there is occasional banter.

Game will definitely keep you entertained for 30-40 hours, as long as you stick to the main mission and perhaps the companion questlines. For these reasons I would give it a 7.5/10 as it's a good game but not quite there. I definitely enjoyed it.

Mostly related to its animations when it came out. Recently however, I decided to play it, being a Mass Effect fan, and itching for another game to play. 

I'd give the game a 7/10, overall. 

The plot is good, its not amazing, or super in depth. Its not as dark or as intriguing as the original trilogy, but its fun, and it leaves a lot of open material for any sequel (next ME is a sequel of the OG Trilogy and Andromeda so we'll see how it goes). 

The gameplay is amazing. Its fluid combat is one of my favorite aspects. The ability to alter profiles, or respec into abilities you want to try is a pleasant change from the mainline ME games. 

The cast/characters are mostly likeable/lovable. Only a few aren't very likeable but that's subjective. 

The soundtrack is a Mass Effect soundtrack. That should describe it pretty well. I like it a fair bit. 

Overall. The game is quite fun, the characters are solid, and the music is great. The only problem is that the plot leaves a little to be desired, and that the facial animations are, well, fixed but not perfect.

It may be relevant to point out that I have NOT played any of the original Mass Effect trilogy, as that seems to be really important to the discussion about this game to a lot of people. 

This game started out awkwardly, with bad writing and weird character interactions in general. I pushed on in hopes that it got better - being a huge star trek fan, I really wanted to get into this game. The story and dialogue did get much, much better. I think it is a shame that the game starts out the way it does, because it is really quite good once you are a few hours into it. The main character, Ryder (Scott in my case) ended up being really, really likable to me in particular, from start to finish, which helped get through the less than stellar writing overall. The graphics, combat, and rpg mechanics are excellent throughout, though, and that helped me push through the awkward beginning. By about half way through my playthrough, I was absolutely hooked and loving the experience. I really felt like I was the captain of a star trek type ship, but with a lot of fun and solid bionic/shooter/tech rpg, 3rd person shooter gameplay to go along with it. By the end of the game, I was very attached to all 10 crew members on board the Tempest (Ryder's exploration ship) and felt invested in establishing colonies and saving the people and aliens in this galaxy and unraveling the mysteries of the Remnant, Kett and their relation to the Angara. There is just SO MUCH decent voice acting throughout the game and the overall quality of the experience was very high. But to be honest, I think the writing, story and dialogue, was sort of holding it back in certain parts (not just in the beginning) when compared to the overall quality of the game as a whole.

This game was an immersive, quality experience overall and I heartily recommend it. I can't wait to pick up the original trilogy in the form of the Legendary Edition and dive into that after experiencing Andromeda, as I hear the story and writing was top notch in those games and I am now pretty invested in the overall lore and aesthetic of the ME Humans, Turians, Krogan, Asari, and Salarians.",1623148316,1623155741,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is richer, and not as constrained, the characters are still pretty awesome, and the world is brand-spanking new, allowing for more mystery and exploration. That is what this game is about. Exploring the world.

After finally playing the original trilogy and seeing Andromeda on sale i thought i give it a shot. 
The story is not as high stakes as the trilogy. It therefore has a generally lighter tone an characters that are less badass. It's actually a little sad, that we won't get a sequel as the story isn't fully concluded or rather teases a sequel. Scott/Sara Ryder are not a Badass N7 Soldier and should not be expected to be a Shepard replacement. This transition from Shepard to Ryder took some getting used to, but over time I've gotten to like Ryder with her more emotional/fun attitude. 
Overall i enjoyed this game quite a lot. The Planets look all amazing and driving through them with the Nomad was quite fun. The writing has some cringe moments but isn't bad for the most part. Your crew has some boring and some fun characters that are a little hit and miss but also not terrible. In typical Mass Effect fashion, it's the humans that are the least interesting. 
There is however one thing that annoyed me: Bugs.
I had more bugs then a game that is not getting any more patches should have. Quest triggers not working. Enemies spawning underground stopping you from progressing (kill all enemies quest trigger) game crashes, slide show in the spaceship even with top hardware. There are luckily many auto saves, so i never had to redo too much, but annoying nonetheless.

Forget the bugs (which are still game-killing, _ years later), forget the facial expressions (which are still noticeable, and which the chosen camera angles occasionally highlight in baffling ways), forget all the problems that came with it being rushed.  Can't blame the devs for not being given the chance to succeed on their terms, after all.

No, this game is a fiasco for the deeper issues that the more surface issues were hiding.  This game has some super bizarre decisions made at the most basic level.  The writing assumes problems are unavoidable that seem super avoidable, for example, or creates ""tension"" between characters that are clearly just passing an idiot ball around.  (Very minor, early spoilers ahead.)  For example, your ship starts the game out by crashing suddenly into a bizarre energy anomaly that the game treats like an unavoidable catastrophe...except the thing isn't moving, and you're on final approach to a planet.  (I was saying at the screen, ""Whoops, we crashed into a space tree!  Yep, we crashed into a space tree.  Sorry guys."")  Or later on, you come to a station with no food supply, running out of power, you get them some basic support fixed up and you provide the hope of exploration that could lead to more permanent solutions for all of these problems--and you go talk to one of the VIPS you need to work with, and she basically says YOU BETTER FIND US A PLANET TO LIVE ON OR WE ALL DIE AND BY THE WAY I DON'T TRUST YOU AND NEVER BELIEVED IN YOU SO I'M NOT HELPING YOU AT ALL.  Look, I know that this is building a character tension to resolve later to emotional payoff or whatever, but she just comes across as a preposterous moron.  Lady, I'm helping you here, you have no other options for assistance that I can see--but also, I'm just one guy, so I mean go solve your problems if you think I'm not your superhero, 'kay?

The writing just needed a few more rinses, is what I'm saying.  But so did the production!  Krogans getting deeper, throatier voice actors makes sense to me, for example, since they look like frog lizard Klingons, but the first Krogan you meet here has this high-pitched minor lisp that makes him sound like a tiny college student working as a barista.  Nothing about his lines suggests he's a joke; they just...went against the grain, because grain.

This game is a fiasco.

I want to be fair: as of this writing, I'm only two hours in and it sounds like it picks up as it goes, so I'll keep at it for a bit.  If this ends up looking entirely unfair, I'll revise it later.  But so far, this game is a misbegotten soup of conflicting ideas that doesn't seem to understand itself at all.

edit: 18 hours in and I'm giving up.  It gets a little focus once you start actually building some colonies, but it never gels into something cohesive.  And missteps, oy: it gave us a ""charming"" Asari scientist we're supposed to like / want to romance / not mind that she's literally living in the escape pods and I can't stand her, the missions spool out every which way with no clear binding material storywise (I wanted to gun down some protesters on the Big Dumb Station, I'll say that) and it just doesn't have control of its own tone.

- Janky UI clearly designed for consoles. Using mouse+keyboard (in otherwise an FPS game) is wonky.

Genre: Third Person RPG

The GOOD:
+ Exploring each planet feels rewarding. I love that you see your ship land on the planet, driving around in your vehicle and finding new locations. The vehicle controls extremely well and is very easy to drive over different terrains. Each of the five major planets has its own atmosphere and environments.  

+ Character builds are more versatile than previous Mass Effect games. You can invest in combat, tech and biotic skills. Depending on where you invest points you automatically upgrade different combat profiles; solder, vanguard, infiltrator etc. The system is identical to Kingdoms of Amalur (same game designer). You can save up to 4 different combat profiles and skills and switch between them easily mid combat.  Different builds play out very differently and it is very easy to re allocate skill points so you can try out different builds. 

+ Combat takes place in more open-ended areas, you can jump, hover and take out your enemies from above, you can move around quickly behind cover etc. Combat is fast paced and fluid and very engaging. Every enemy encounter is always interesting. 

+ The main story is well presented. As the pathfinder its your job to find habitable planets for different species to survive. Although the stakes are not nearly as high as previous ME games, I still found it engaging enough to hold my interest throughout the journey.  I would have liked a stronger connection to the previous games and although the story does make a few hints, I feel it was a missed opportunity.

+ Each crew member has their own loyalty missions. These missions are more engaging than your typical side quests often resulting in having to make a difficult choice at the end.  

+ Galaxy map/planet scanning has been completely overhauled. You no longer have to fly to each planet to scan them. You simply select the planet you want in any given cluster and you automatically zoon in to get a detailed description as well as an indicator if there are any scannable locations. Its fast and easy and doesn’t take away from the game.  

THE AVERAGE::
+/- There is an overabundance of side quests. Although they do a good job of fleshing out the story, characters and world, the majority of these quests feel like cheap busy work. Most of them revolve around collecting or scanning a certain number of objects. I would have preferred much fewer side quests but make them more meaningful. 

+/- You have a good mix of crew members. Talking to them reveals their motives, backstory and history. They are interesting, but compared to other Bioware games, they feel a step below what you would come to expect. The only crew member that was really well written was Drack the Krogan. 

+/- Visual glitches and a few random crashes. 

THE BAD:
- You are granted money and resources at set time intervals. However, the game does not give any indication when you can collect these rewards and in order to do so you have to travel to your ship and watch an un-skippable cutscene. The entire thing seems poorly thought out.  

- Although there are many different character builds, you can only assign 3 active skills per build.  

- Certain achievements are glitchy 

Conclusion: 
I know this game got a lot of heat when it was first released due to its technical problems. Most (not all) technical issues have been resolved. Although it may not play exactly like previous Mass Effect games, I like that they tried something new with its combat and gameplay systems.

Wish there is a 'Meeeehhhhhhhhhh' rating because it's not bad and not good. Also don't buy this game at full price. EA have stop all support, MP is dead. 

Bought for $10 AUD, animation is a little tired and the story is 'Meh'. Nothing like ME 1 2 & 3, no more galaxy wide crisis. 

Gameplay wise are interesting at first, but gets old real fast. Explore new planet, clear quest, establish a colony, move to the next planet, do some character quest. It's trying to be Mass Effect trilogy but it isn't. 

New Aliens looks so similar to us, same anatomy same building style, same vehicles, same weapons, have male and female. They also don't really care about us. About how we travelled across galaxy, about our biotic ability, about 'alien' technology. They're just ""oh you're an Alien and you hate our enemies, welcome!""

Every planet forces you to visit a Vault, which are all far too dark and filled with awkward platforming sections.  The Vaults remind me a lot of the towers in Oblivion, just doing the same thing over and over.

After a few hours into it (I have more than 20), you will start getting weird crashes after trying to load your saves, both manual saves or autosaves.

After avoiding this game for the first few years I finally decided to pick it up, I regret not doing it sooner.

While I understand that a lack of Shepard is something to get used to, I do think Andromeda offered a fresh perspective on the Mass Effect universe. In this game you are literally far away from all the issues that plague the Normandy Crew, you are an explorer not a soldier. Andromeda offers you a lot more space exploration that the original trilogy does and I can best describe it as ""Mass Effect Casual"" the story is a lot more relaxed and you'll spend a lot of time running around on various planets without the pressure of any reapers invading. 

The characters were enjoyable, the non-companion crew members of the Tempest felt more involved in the story than the Normandy ones. The milky way races have been stripped down to just the council races which is a shame but you do get 2 new races while you progress the story. 

Combat was a massive improvement over the somewhat clunky ME: trilogy ones as well as an improved Mako (Nomad) which doesn't bounce around your screen with every single bump it meets. 

As for the negative parts:
A LOT of backtracking which can sometimes feel incredibly tedious. I wanted to finish most side quests before starting the final conflict of the main quest and it felt like it took ages. This sadly did pull me out of the story a bit. I swear the moment I saw that I needed to head to Kadara again, I wanted bang my head against the table. 

No Quarians, Drell, Hanar, Volas etc and most importantly, no one from the original games. Besides the occasional mention/cameo you will not encounter any of the characters from the original Trilogy.

The facial animation is hilarious at some points, but it's Bioware what did we expect.

I don't recommend this game. _If_ you know how to mod and don't mind running frosty mod manager, creating a mod stack, then you'll enjoy the heck out of this game. It's the same as Skyrim so don't get dismayed. So let's discuss what you need to make this game fun.
-----------------------------------------------------
1) Frosty Mod Manager //used to create your stack.

2) Reshade Version 4.9.1* / Near_Perfect_Reshade ini //bring it that dark charm. but I do think the Apex looks amazing as well. I just love the Ray tracing features from NPR. 

3) Mods to replace all the characters //characters are fugly without replacement.

4) Lightswitch mod // allows you turn your flashlight on and off. Important with Apex

now what makes me love this game is these 3 mods. 

1) First Person Combat
2) First Person Conversations
3) First Person Exploration

After modding the heck out of it to my liking i'm loving the game. But not everyone wants to do that, so I can't recommend the base game. But with a little TLC you can restore this game to the greatness that the rest of the Mass Effect series has.

I saw ME:A on sale for like $7.50 usd, so I got it for PC and have been playing it through again with mods this time (played on xbox originally). Having just played the Legendary Edition OT, several things are immdeiately apparent to me and much more noticeable than when I originally played Andromeda in 2017. They got combat right, it's a big step up from previous games and I already thought ME:3's combat was very enjoyable. I had a blast experimenting with profiles and different powers. The graphics were better in some cases, such as environments, but the animations are noticeably worse than ME:3's imo. There's pretty much no attractive characters in this game, the models are noticeably worse, and the only races I thought looked really good in general were Salarians and Krogan. Asari went from being beautiful to being comical, and Humans almost all just look goofy or cartoony in some way. 
If you take this as a stand alone space exploration game, it's a fine game. The biggest thing missing in Andromeda though for a Mass Effect game is the Mass Effect feel, it really DOESN'T feel like a Mass Effect game. So much of that imo comes down to the comparatively weak writing, and poorly integrated game design decisions.
On the writing front, try as it might to inject urgency and tension, the story just lacks momentum, and the characters you experience it with get thrown together in such a way that their being together on the Tempest feels forced and unearned from the players perspective. The characters certainly aren't all bad, and there's plenty of good interactions with them on board the Tempest and on missions, but I think this game sorely missed the ""Dossiers"" of previous Mass Effect entries, where we got to know our potential crew mates a bit better on a unique mission based on their backgrounds before bringing them aboard. 
The pacing of the story is further sabotaged in my opinion by the non linear game design. I'm actually usually all for open worlds in games, I tend to love them, and when done right can make what in reality is a relatively small game world seem expansive and wondrous. But in the case of Andromeda, the open world design meant that the gameplay itself was really not being driven by the narrative at all, as the OT were. So even if the story worked on paper, as it plays out in game its paced so poorly and interrupted so frequently by errand quests that it really just fails to compel the player forward on narrative grounds alone. This bad interplay between gameplay and story would still be tolerable, if disappointing, if the various gameplay mechanics themselves were more individually rewarding, but as it is mechanics like Andromeda viability, nexus levels, and outpost building -all things that could add a lot of depth to the game and smooth over the slower paced story- are very tersely implemented and lack depth. Because the game forces you to spend so much time doing quests that effect these scores, it would be nice if they had a bigger effect on the course of the story. There's also just a lot that wasn't explored there, and so instead of the open world making everything feel more expansive and like exploration really pays off, the games overall design leaves the player feeling like it's a world full of chores to do with little reward or impact. 
If you can get this game at a steep discount like I did, it can be worth it and you can have a casual fun time in this universe, but if you're looking for a Mass Effect fix go play the legendary edition OT, because this game will probably let you down on that front. Mods go a long way toward improving the experience, and you can play this game through and have hours of fun with it, but with Andromeda being completely abandoned post release and probably no more content coming for it in terms of sequels (I don't think it's an unsalvageable IP, but that's a different conversation entirely) it's hard to feel good about grinding through this game anymore. I hope the next entry in the Mass Effect series really looks at the core of what went wrong with Andromeda, and that bioware takes what worked and rethinks the rest.",1622600939,1622600939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm pleased to say I was pleasantly surprised given that generally it wasn't as well received as it's predecessors.

The stand-out points for this game were:

- Excellent combat mechanics - I think if anything they are greatly improved over the originals and felt it was more fluid and simply more fun.

- The characters - its possible that I simply was not as invested in the Sheppard character from the original games (bit of a one dimensional douche bag) but I felt that the new protagonist was more interesting and I was just generally more engaged and invested in the story. I thought a lot of the support characters were excellent as well - Liam was a stand-out for me but the others were equally good.

- The storyline & game world - both excellent. The premise of finding new Worlds to colonise is interesting and the sheer scale and size of the galaxies you get to explore are huge and fun.

---

But what didn't I like?

Actually there is just one thing about this game I really dislike if I had to mention anything (and the one thing that put me off the first Mass Effect incidentally) is the amount of driving you have to do to get to places. I just found this laborious and boring.

It’s not all roses, although the game is out for 4 years It still has a fair amount of bugs, which probably won’t be fixed in the near future.  Most of them aren’t mayor and can be resolved by reloading, but for some, if you have bad luck and run into them, you will need to look for solution on forums, in 65 hours of gameplay I had a few minor ones and for two of them I had to look for solution. The main reason I have encountered most of the minor including two “big” ones is because I am “Completionist” and 99% of the bugs happened on side quests

I refunded it.
Why? Storytelling is in a crisis.

So... I played this from the beginning with a very open mind and I had no experience with the old Mass Effect games.
I heard so many bad things about this game, that it was really hard to reset my expectations.
All I want is a good story (which is the problem... plus I'm old and have read many good stories).

The beginning was really good.
The atmosphere was pretty nice and the excitement to explore the planet grew...
But then came the first encounter with another species.

This is what an old western movie was like... no interesting talk, no interaction, no sneaking... just:
""Oh, daim. They caiptured our ol friend Luke.
Baid! Baid! They are baid baid aliens *BAM BAMM BAMM BANG* That's what thay deserved. Howdy!""

I know that shooting stuff is part of the game. But I feel no connection to the alien world anymore.
All the wonders of a new home. Alien creatures with a new culture. Secrets and rituals that nobody ever witnessed...
Nope. Just shootin the bad guys.
With a society that advanced, is there no other way to go about investigating the NEW HOME FOR 20.000 PEOPLE????

I won't continue with this ""story"" and watch Bladerunner instead.

I was immediately disapointed by the flat introduction and story setup as well as some quirky graphic issues that shouldnt exist. Its just soo blasae.

I have only an iota of a clue to what just happened on the planet because of game audio design.
I didnt bother even saving the game when i exit out because i realized that half of the story is going to be cut because i walked 3 inches to the left. Seriously, dialogue just stops when you hit a threshold.
This says to me not only are we not here for the story, but we also dont really care to polish it.
Knowing this, im confident i will miss huge parts of conversations and even reply to ones i never had.
This is a huge deal as a part of the Mass Effect series and unaceptible in any story driven game.
I will also note, every conversation i had so far in game was meaningless and was a talk in circles about crap were literally hired for or actually doing atm.

Speaking of, the game play so far is just uninspired and hacky.
Why were human loot boxes inside of alien structures?
How did sooooo many drop pods crash so conviently inside of caverns?
Where the hell did all of these ammo drops come from?
How the hell do i know how to use alien tech but not know how to hold a proper convo?
Any effort put into the game went to other places i will never see.

Another thing i noticed was the Depth of Field extruding foreground models and blurring random holographic objects that should be clear view. Not a big deal, but really showed what i was about to get into graphics wise.

Im on keyboard and mouse, it heavily shows this is a controller game.

Now this may be harsh, but my god this is a total let down and a great demonstration of poor design and development for me to feel so strongly after not even a hr game play.

Oh, and of course you need whorigin to even play the game.
Way to ruin another franchise EA...

A few picks people have had are the story, open world, and bugs.
Story is a trainwreck, theres no salvaging that, but if you overlook it you can find some good gameplay.
The open world feels nice to me, I'm not sure why people complain its too big? I've only visited the first two explorable worlds so far and it feels just right to me with a decent variation between them.
As for the bugs, they're practically all gone. So far haven't encountered any bug that would be noticable or broken my game.

I can start the game fine but after a little bit of gameplay, all of a sudden my cpu reaches 100%, which either crashes or the cpu usage goes down only to have it crash later on. 

Went around everywhere looking for a fix on this and eventually found that, If you have anything unstable, be it a cpu, ram or gpu, then look to see in your bios if anything is overclocking. Just save your OC settings on another profile and set one profile for stock settings.

That's mostly the main problem for most like me. If it isn't for you. however then you might want to do some other fixes like turning borderless window/optimizing resolution&graphics. After tinkering around I found that lowering graphics (post process on low, everything off (HDR, Triple Buffering etc)) to the lowest level, turning v-sync off (or on for some people), and putting it on a window type mode. 
One thing to note is where the game seemed to work itself was: just getting to a certain point, saving, and restarting the game and waiting a little while when I loaded for it to process everything; usage stays low until you reach a buffer zone or somewhere else zone intensive. 

I also went to download some mod fixes that did help out, albeit only a little in virtual use issues, that fixed bugs that made crashes happen.
One thing to note too is, after testing this on my laptop and older PC, I found that the game works well with older cpus that have around lesser threads or resources to work with. Though for those machines the game suddenly wants to eat up their RAM lol.

That's all I've tried and found to work out in making the game work. 
If you want to buy and try, get it. If you don't have problems then good for you. If you do have problems look around some fixes to get it working for you, it is a mess full of performance leaks everywhere after all.
I liked playing it now where I didn't get any crashes. Yhough the experience getting to that point didn't give me much satisfaction in playing, but I enjoyed the gameplay which was much better compared to the previous trilogy. But for all that effort.

Why I stopped playing, is a combination of things:
- You get spammed with quests. And you can't finish most of them without travelling half the galaxy and progress through the story. If you like to neatly clear location after location, this game will laugh in your face.
- Combat system itself is okay, but sometimes enememies seem to spawn directly in your face, when you run around the corner (you can scope the area with a skilll, but that doesn't help). Loosing progress in an enemy base means you have to repeat everything (fighting, collecting, scanning). Very annoying, when you died because of ridiculous spawn system.

A lot of the criticisms of Andromeda still stand. The default character for Ryder, especially as female, is the derpiest looking character I think I've ever seen in a game. Much better experience if you create your own custom Ryder to play as. There are also still a few bugs, but overall I didn't experience more than a handful over the course of 116 hours.

All-in-all, this game is actually much better than I expected it to be. The story is great, the worlds are beautiful and it's got some of that Bioware charm to it that really makes ME special. If you are going to play this game, I wouldn't advise comparing it to your experience with ME 1-3 because that was 3 games of story, character development and twists. It's not going to be possible for any single game with a new story, new characters and new style to stand up to multiple games in that way.

I still recall playing ""Zero Hour"" of this game on the console-- ""My face is tired"" good lord lolololol

Now after 4 years does the game hold up? Well- if a game were to have a neutral score: this would be one of them

In ME:A you are Pathfinder Ryder (Male or Female); seeking out a home for millions of colonist from the council races of the Milky Way Galaxy in the Andromeda Galaxy- and in the classic science fiction style: It is anything but... now you and the Tempest crew must scour the galaxy and find a new home, keep the lights on; all the while trying to be ""heroes"" or at the very least find a sensible understanding of the word

So what went right and what went wrong?

First the right- 
Unlike in Dragon Age: Inquisition; the open world here works as you can freely explore a sandbox area of a planet. Each one with it's own set of quests, and environmental hazards. 

Audio and overall combat is top notch; very fun, very exciting whenever you don a different profile with a different set of powers; these ""profiles"" are basically the 'classes' from the Shepard Trilogy- but instead of being restricted you can pick whatever one you like, be aware each one works differently so don't forget to level up abilities, get better armor, and upgrade guns and mod them!

Graphics are fairly decent. Obviously this was made the with Frostbite engine- which is both beautiful looking at times, and cringe worthy at times; this goes DOUBLE for the character models- you sincerely need to mod the game's character models (especially female Pathfinder) in order to get some decent looks during your playthrough

Then we come to the ""wrong"" or rather the 'miss potential'

The story; and the companions- first off, let me make this clear: THIS ISN'T THE SHEPARD TRILOGY and that is totally okay. The idea of rookies trying to become 'heroes' for the Andromeda Initiative is such a cool idea! But on concept only, Bioware fails to roll with it, in almost every way. It's still a fun ""spin-off"" story. But as a Mass Effect story it fails. Over the course of the game your just a bunch of randoms trying to do whatever it takes, but by the end of it; you become heroes

As of the companions, much like the story don't try and compare the Normandy Crew. That will just be a flat out NEGATIVE for you; but to me, much like the story the characters all have cool potential and it works in some cases but in other instances it's just oof; it's not Dragon Age II bad, it's more of- had there been more proper time fleshing out the characters then we can understand the direction. But since this is a one and only game in the Andromeda series we have to judge everything right here and now.

Which leads to the main factor ""Choice"" to sum it all up- it's Fallout 4 with the Mass Effect named slapped on it. And what I mean by that is- there is an illusion of choice with only the sarcastic option being a good choice- because being a bad guy here is depressing as heck, and the paragon choices are just covered in all of that goodness good. 

Character creation is royally fucked over. As while some of the Pathfinder male designs are decent, the female ones-- if there was a definition of ""Fucked over"" this would be an example. Heavily mod the character creation to get some decent out of the female pathfinder.

Finally the multiplayer is decent. There is no tie-in much like the Dragon Age Inquisition multiplayer component.

For the price tag of $30 i say it's worth it. However, please understand as I mentioned consider this a spin-off; if you hold it to high expectations you will be disappointed and ask for a refund ASAP.",1622174128,1622174128,True,2,0,0.509433984756469727,0,True,False,False

-Story sucks, is full of cliches and VERY predictable
-characters almost exclusively suck, including the protagonist and crewmates 
-animations suck (the memey ones got fixed by now but they generally still aren't good), 
-rest of the graphics look kinda nice,
-level/planet design is pretty mediocre for the most part. You have basically 3 different kinds of deserts (sand, stone and snow/ice), a jungle planet which looks pretty, and a huge mountain range which looks also pretty nice
-open world is mostly empty aside from the relevant stuff. It's ""filled"" with  a few minor enemy outposts or ruins which have a chance to spawn a few enemies to fight.
-hardest difficulty becomes gradually easier for some reason
-surprisingly big amount of enemy types
-HORRIBLE AI
-lots of abilities to play around and experiment with (sadly you're limited to 3 abilities per ""Profile"". You can change between 4 of those profiles midcombat but changing them activated a long global cooldown making it somewhat useless)
-lots of possible playstyles
-many guns, armorparts and upgrades/modifications to choose from

long story short: Gameplay is fun, graphic looks nice, everything else ranges from mediocre to bad.

There is a lot of variety in combat styles, and freedom to customize and upgrade your powers. There are many profiles you can choose from to give you the most advantage, depending on the way you like to fight. My favorite was Vanguard. I enjoyed crafting weapons and armor myself. Fighting with these assets is very exhilarating! Guns feel punchy, and launching enemies to the sky with biotics makes you feel invincible.

And the characters certainly leave the most impact on you, more so if you choose to romance them. Though, some characters are more memorable than others, but still great. What comes to Ryder's character however, you get to define them yourself. It's quite amazing how lacking the Pathfinder's distinct traits are; they are like a blank slate.

The previous Mass Effect games dropped you into the middle of a huge galactic epic, where you were already a super cool space person. But in Andromeda you're discovering a new galaxy from the start. It's exciting and a great spin on the series. Familiar but not too repetitive. Hopefully we'll get more from Mass Effect because these games just rock and fill me with a childlike-sense of wonder I thought was long gone!",1621979959,1621979959,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hang on, this is a game review, not a movie review. Let me start again...

Andromeda, a haven and beacon of hope, is home to many interesting characters, places, and in some cases, jokes. You play as the pathfinder, exploring the unknown while trying to romance every character on your ship. Only to get bluntly rejected by those who do not swing your way. At it's heart, it is a a great RPG game.

There is a ton of things to do, characters to meet and lands to explore. The majority of the quests are unique and keep you engaged, and none of the grind-esk quests are required to be completed in order to enjoy the game. The graphics are stellar and the world is smooth. 

The only gripe I have is having to watch the planetary landing sequences over, and over again. Those really got annoying towards the end, when you had to jump all over the galaxy in order to wrap up quests. 

Other than that, a great game that I highly recommend to any who are in need of a new RPG adventure.

+ immersion
+ crew involved in dialogues with other npc
+ crew to crew dialogues during missions
+ driving nomad 
+ best render of rain on fabric I've seen yet

+/- equipment progression is barely significant, it's not a looter-shooter though

- combat is meh (played on the harder difficulty), crew members are just meat shields that dance around enemy npc's while waiting for player to take action
- even though you use an AI through quantum computing, you still have to go back to the ship to read emails so the quest triggers can update...

The good:
- great graphics 
- great story, although the main story is kind of short
- I liked the introduction of jet packs which enables more exploration options and combat options

- Ocazional problems with texture lighting (similar to the original mass effect games on AMD CPUs)
