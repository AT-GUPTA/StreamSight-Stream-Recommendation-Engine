Tomb Raider follows Lara Croft, a young and ambitious archaeologist who travels with a crew to the island of Yamatai in search of the islands lost kingdom. Along the way, Lara and her crew are stranded and meet a overzealous cult that try to kill them.

I won't elaborate on the plot to save spoilers, but I definitely enjoyed this games story. Lara is notable for being one of the few female protagonists in the gaming industry, and has since become a significant figure in popular culture; very likable. Good voice acting, soundtrack, and pretty visuals overall among other nice details.

The game play is enjoyable and progresses well with the story as Lara unlocks new skills, gadgets that help her transverse the islands environment, and weapons to aid in combat. I had no technical issues, bugs and all while playing and was surprised at how well the game ran for being over a decade old at this point. Exploration and parkour are an emphasis while adventuring through the island to raid tombs and collect items around the map, with fast travel also being in an option to aid with this. My two favorite things about the game-play might be how Lara automatically takes cover without needing to press a key, and how dying is extremely forgiving. When Lara dies, there is no game-over screen and instead a quick loading one which places her basically right where she was when she died.

Overall, a short and sweet action-adventure game worth the price!

Before purchasing, do note two things. Firstly, the multiplayer mode. It is the only Tomb Raider game with multiplayer apart from the sequel ""Rise of the Tomb Raider"" and, while it is functional and offers a fun and unique third-person shooter experience, no longer has an active player base. Consequently because of this, it is virtually impossible to gain a chunk of the achievements in this game multiplayer related. Secondly, in my experience, I found that the single-player mode was impossible to complete 100% due to a missing ornament in the ""Sun Killer"" challenge, which at best left me with the option of getting 68% achievements and 99% single player completion.",1709005199,1709005199,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I had just completed Rise of the Tomb Raider (I bought that one first, so unfortunately I’m doing the trilogy out of order) and was prepared for a bit of a letdown when I started playing this game. Graphically it’s not as polished (as expected for an 11 year old game), but honestly, it still holds its own. But man, this game is intense!  I played ROTR on ‘Tomb Raider’ level, which is #2 out of 4 difficulty levels, and this game on Normal difficulty. I’ll have to go back and play ROTR on one of the higher settings to see how things change, but here are some comparisons of TR vs ROTR:

[list]
[*]TR has much more sheer action. ROTR is a bit more puzzle-oriented
[*]Many cutscenes that morph into you having to control Lara again, mostly stuff like sliding out of control and having to dodge items and/or jump at just the right time
[*]Lots more combat. Lost count of how many times I’d round a corner or drop into a room and there were a bunch of enemies waiting to kill me
[*]Possibly more enjoyable? ROTR was great, but it seemed a tad more tame and structured compared to this one. All the elements of puzzle solving and acrobatics are in both, but the amount of variety, cutscenes and just edge-of-your-seat craziness are more than ROTR. I found myself laughing out loud during scenes bc of how bonkers the action was.
[/list]

The one thing that would take away a star is that I encountered a few bugs (playing on a Mac M1 w/Silicon chip). They were during the transition from cutscene to when you start playing again, and a few times things just sort of froze and I had to quit and restart a few times. Eventually the game would work through it, but very annoying when it happened. This happened a handful of times throughout the game. That being said, this is still a great adventure game overall and an easy recommend, even today!",1708545278,1708995265,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've never changed my mind on a review once i posted one but after playing through another full round, i found it rather frustrating in terms of playabliity. game kicked me out to win three different times, locked up once which i had it kill the game through steam.
the crazy pitfall jumps where the ledge is just too far away for the char to climb ax into was what finally did it for me. after 20+ times trying to jump only to miss the ledge on a main mission then by blind luck, the ax finally clung into the rack face. 
the tomb of flooded fault, had to finally let that one go due to the long jump of death. must have tried that one 30+ times before finally giving it the middle finger and moving on. youtube, game guides, walkthroughs all showed the ax in hand as they jumped. nope. fell to my death 100% of the time on this one. 
i gave one of the other tomb raiders a negative review for this same thing, jump over impossible pitfall and simply would not allow me to catch hold of other ledge. very frustrating


old review:
Never played any of the Tomb Raider games before picking this one up on sale. I was pleasantly surprised at how well you could maneuver through the open world and interact with the settings. Overall I would give it a 9 ½ out of 10. Other than learning how to maneuver quickly then aiming before able to fire any weapon, I really enjoyed this game as a whole.

Pros:
Interesting CG in cut scenes
Earn a lot more XP points on skilled kills
Rather life-like in which you miss jumping on a rope by a small margin and you see a pretty death scene…
Didn’t seem to lose any XP points from dying… a lot … 
Really liked the instinct mode

Cons:
A few places the game play wasn’t very intuitive
game crashed, but only once so can't complain too much

What happened to the actual tomb raiding in these games? Tomb raiding is an afterthought....

Stick a tomb on the side of the linear path, can't miss it. Enter the tomb to only find some of the most uninteresting tombs ever found in any of tomb raider games. Once inside, your puzzle is very simple, very dull and all of this is over and done with in only 5 mins, on your first try without using the MAGIC BUTTON, that holds your hand lighting up your area giving you clues ............

The game is mostly about the over the top action scenes, very much like a hollywood blockbuster. Lots of cutscenes and endless hordes of enemies to kill, plus plenty of QTE'S. No real exploring in this game, no real tomb raiding, shallow gameplay, with way too much hand holding.

The combat is easy but fun and the exploration is again easy straight forward, but fun and its a decent action game to play over a weekend, a nice if overly graphics focused reboot even.
However the team in charge of cinematics really needs to calm down and sit in a quiet room with no access to caffeine for atleast 10 years before doing any future projects...Chill bro its ok, everything doesn't have to explode all the time and Lara CAN just calmly approach an objective without falling about 1000 ft to just hold her side as if winded after bouncing off 12 trees before then being forced through another unskippable sequence where she screams Jonah repeatedly as the camera quake ensues. (This applies to all the following reboot titles as well but the director of these games I'm glad to say has long since moved on, probably to make even more on rails insta grat camera shake nonsense.

I'm an old school Tomb Raider fan, so when this reboot got announced I got excited and cautious. I wasn't that big of a fan of the new Lara, she's too short, too whiny, too much of a princess. The original Lara was taller, sexier, more confident. However I quickly grew very fond of new Lara. I still prefer the original, but this new one is cool as well. She yells a lot in a very high pitched annoying shrill voice, but nevertheless, she's sweet, strong, smart and attractive. She becomes much more annoying in following games and much less attractive for some reason. And considering Phoebe Waller-Bridge has taken over the franchise, that trend will exacerbate considerably sadly.

The game is basically a rip-off of Uncharted, but it's a good formula, so I don't mind, in fact I prefer this over Uncharted. I love that this is semi-open world; play through it once, then come back when you feel like it to finish up the collectibles and challenges. Those challenges aren't really original, but they weren't outstaying their welcome. Peppered throughout the game are optional tombs, which are very short in comparison with other TR games, but fun nonetheless. And the light metroidvania elements add some welcome layering. The skill systems and weapon upgrade systems are superficial, yet slightly engaging.

The combat is fairly standard, the bow is quite satisfying, the other weapons aren't amazing, but they serve their purpose. Melee combat is very primitive; the dodge window is large enough to park a car in, in fact I find that the timing is a bit off, if you dodge the moment the sword hits, there's no option for a counter attack.

Jumping, climbing, swinging, etc... is all great, in fact a lot better then in Shadow of the Tomb Raider for some reason, I was incredibly frustrated by the numerous jumps I missed in that game, in this one, I only missed jumps from wall to wall for some reason. The dodge button is bound to Shift on PC, which is odd because I had the reflex to dodge every time I wanted to sprint, considering there curiously is no sprint in Tomb Raider.

The game is nicely paced, in my 100% run I had collected everything at the very end of the game, which also coincided with me getting all weapon and skill upgrades towards the very end of the game. Nicely done!

The story isn't bad, being trapped on an island, boats and planes unable to leave due to some supernatural force, that's all quite good. You stranded there along with a very diverse cast of characters, as if cast by Netflix. There's the white girl, the Asian girl, the black girl, the useless white guy, the sleazy white guy, the  Polynesian guy, etc... I didn't have a problem with any one character, Joslin was a bit too bossy and arrogant for my taste, but these days a character like that is a must. I really liked Roth, I wished her relationship with Lara was fleshed out a bit more, that would make his loss a lot more gripping. He was the only character that seemed to know what he was doing, everybody else was too feeble for my taste. Also I really think half the actors pronounce Lara's name Laura.

Anyway, apart for the band of groupies, I like the story quite a bit.

I've played through the game now 3 times, I'm working on getting the multiplayer achievements, but considering I'm not getting a match, as it's 12 years after release, I doubt I'll ever get my achievements completed. Thanks CD for bringing Multiplayer into the achievement mix... sigh.

Visuals : Game does look very good, certain areas are beautiful. The weather conditions are well portrayed and overall the atmosphere is realistic

Music : The orchestra used is almost perfect for most scenes, changes tempo and rhythm to show oncoming threats, but also parts of happiness and exploration. It makes you invested into the game.

Story-line : Easy to follow, maybe too much and cliche. This may be more of a pro than a con.

These are pros which mainly revolve around the visuals and atmosphere built through the music. Then we move onto the cons, which sadly are extensive.

Cons - 

Lara herself : Lara gets absolutely victimised in this game, and somehow survives every single time. I thought it was quite funny towards the end of the story, Reyes has one gunshot wound on her arm and states that she almost died, and Lara is worried and runs to assist. Meanwhile, Lara has survived concussions, drowning, burning, shootings, stabbings, stomach impalement, hypothermia, severe starvation & dehydration, fatal insomnia, attacks from wolves, fractures, caught in bear traps, torched alive, a multitude of falls, probably every rib cracked, plane/helicopter crash and falling through trees. It is almost hard to believe that she could ever die because she ""just about makes it"" every 5 minutes.

Camera shake : Far too strong and unnecessary. The screen just wobbles when Lara walks so imagine when she uses a zip-line, or any other torture form above. 

UI : UI not rendering at 100% scalability, for some reason the corners are cut off despite being set at native.

Game's mechanics : Shockingly repetitive. Spam to pry open. Duck / walk, get spotted/heard. Lara proceeds to murder 100+ people. Move on, repeat. Survive another near death experience, barely survive, find a gun and kill another 100 people. Discover something new, (maybe that her crew are all useless and actual liabilities which are part of the reason why she almost dies every half an hour), continue fighting.

Puzzles : Or lack of puzzles. The couple that were there were so easy they don't count, most of the time there was just one route or option, and that was enough to get you through.

It's good, but it felt like a chore to finish the game. This honestly could have been far better without majority of the fighting, less clumsiness and belligerence from her crew, and her not having to ""barely survive"" so much.",1706740135,1707649148,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1.（手柄）正常的武器键位，不像11的逆天切武器2重键位还有bug
2. 弓的手感比11强
3. 整体品控强不止一点，非常顺滑（虽然后期有些崩）。11的品控一言难尽。
4. level design水准高了一个档次。11的level就像初学者做的。
5. 音效，氛围，台词，人设，运镜高了一个档次。11除去战斗部分玩得想睡着。

不如11的地方：
1. 枪的手柄辅瞄奇怪。但是强辅瞄很若只，11就是这样，所以11重刀战和潜行，枪强辅瞄限制子弹，9这点“不如”11。
2. 野外摘草除了加经验没啥用。11就变成了嗑药。
3. 实际上攀岩解密都不如11复杂。但是11品控不过关，解密也没新意，只堆复杂度，所以反而成了9的爽点。

Introduce Lara and her environment, also to tell how she become Lara Croft step by step. In the new era tomb raider, we can see easily the trace of the Uncharted games. Because developers inspire from Uncharted's crayz missions and i loved it. Graphs are convenient because mud like things on the skin, looks like ps1 game but the other things, especially view is amazing. About storytelling, i can say great and poor. What i mean is, you know its ""tomb raider"", you gonna absoutely trying to explore some mthys or crayz things and that was great. Story basics are brilliant but its a aspect from mthys and historic events. The other thing is character development... And it is very poor. I'm sad because this game has such a potential for the start brand new ""TOMB RAIDER"" but the game nothing about Lara. If we put someone called like Sarah or something and change the name as a ""Adventures of Sarah"" nothing gonna probably change. I'm not saying all the storyline is bad, Im saying is all great but character development. And my 2nd sentence in this review is the summary of what developers think when they do this game but they didn't suceed. Shooting mechanics in the game are flawless, animations ok for 2013, sound design little glitchy and climbing mechanics sometimes bugging. And this half open world design great for me. Because there is lots of things to do in map and its better than big boring maps. Side missions and the other collectiable things are ok.

You should buy this on DST bundle special discount only
I dunno why it's overwhelming positive but unfortunately this one didn't hook me on a feeling, felt like scammed some honestly so I gave a thumb down, hope the other two Rise and Shadow will do better
-First of all, bugs, glitches VERY often at some places or just move quicker than the game react and get camera bug (I had to reload checkpoint many times) and a ""stopped working"" crash. Skipped the screen resolution problem bcuz it wasn't a big deal
-Plot ain't interesting, only thing I remember is that one iconic dialogue ""She's just one girl. That one girl is kicking our *ss!""
-Characters are forgettable, didn't build well enough to impress players, only thing I remember was LaraSam otp (I love les :3)
-Some unrealistic details in game like the landing gear of that one big bird rescue AC-130 didn't take off while flying and the two pilots jumped out and parachuting, the whole rescue helicopter later just one pilot control it, bruh :v and some more you call 'em 
-Quick-time events is annoyed, really -_-
-No replay value bcuz there's no ""New Game Plus"" a big minus, so you have to play all over again with empty-handed >:(
-I don't wanna spoil the ending but it's money-stealing, you don't fight the ""real"" final boss (it's just play in cutscene) you just fight a mini boss at final (and it's ez asf) >:(
-DLCs outfits were simplistic, didn't eye-catchy, I picked the Guerilla ones and played the whole game twice :/
-Movements and camera angles at some point is... -,- but the ones focused on her *ss from behind is noice UwU

And the rest are good things the game have done

I gave this 2,5/5 ★

The outline of the story is good, voice acting is serviceable but the mysteries/mysticism in the plot keep you invested. Some really threatening enemies and some surprisingly dark/violent moments that occur but without stealing away from the adventurous/Indiana jones tone that you'd expect from Lara. 

Gameplay is slick and modernised (sorry no backflip duel wielding a pack of wolves anymore). as you'd expect, over the shoulder with weapons wheel and utilities. Plays just fine and the bow is really satisfying. Enemy A.I can be decent, lots of flanks and areas for enemies to surface, but sometimes they're dull as dishwater and you can cheese them despite the open environments that a lot of the battles take place in. 

I mean damn son, what else do you want? I'd say when it comes to reboots/remakes this is upper echelons, like maybe even top 5 who knows.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]For a 2013 game, this is mighty impressive. The environments are absolutely incredible and filled with life (and death). If you love bones, this is your game. The caves and tombs are filled with environmental storytelling and they look so filled with detail. The lighting is also incredible in this game, especially in the cave sections. Lara looks incredible and the animations are really well put together and immersive.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]Gameplay mechanics are top tier here. You can unlock skill points to make Lara even more of a killing machine, upgrades for your weapons to make them really powerful. The progression in this game is so well done and keeps you wanting more and more. The puzzles were pretty good in this game. Some puzzles really make you think (which is hard for my little brain) but they are really satisfying once you pass them. The difficulty is pretty good. I was playing on hard mode and I had some difficulties but mostly because I'm slow. The gunplay is actually really good and engaging. I will say that I had to switch to keyboard and mouse because the QTEs (Quick Time Events) were really inconsistent for me and it was hard to figure out what key to press. It could just be on my end though. Besides that the game feels really good with a controller so no problems there.[/td]

    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]I never played a Tomb Raider game, but this game was truly special in terms of story. Lora Croft is such an interesting and badass character. By the end of the game, I got so invested and was bummed out that it was over. The story is amazing, and truly worth anyone's time. Your goal is to find a way to escape this cursed island and while you try and find a way out, you find so many amazing historical artifacts and tombs that really got me invested. The Villain was really interesting to me and the side characters were really likable as well. There is so much to talk here about the story, but all I have to say is wow. This story really got me invested and I wish I had amnesia so I can experience it all again for the first time.[/td]

        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]

        [td]The sound design is amazing! The voice acting is incredible and really believable. The music is settled and fits the game really well. Also the music is settled and feels relaxing when it’s in the background (kinda like ambiance). The gun sounds are punchy and satisfying and the enemy dialogue is good.[/td]

    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]You will find some funny glitches. For example items floating and I had an enemy do donuts around a table which was odd. The out of bound areas can be kinda odd especially near cliffs but those are very far and between.[/td]

╰ ⊹₊˚ ໒  Though one could say I have formed somewhat of a bias for this game, I must disagree a tad. It holds a special place for my heart, but I was open to exploring the descendants too. However, after playing through the entire remake trilogy, I, in fact, realised I have a bias. And also, that this game simply cannot be beat. ✧˖°.

 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀જ⁀➴「  𝒱𝒾𝓈𝓊𝒶𝓁𝓈:」

╰ ⊹₊˚ ໒ The other games lacked severely in atmosphere. Graphics were beautiful, but I was irked by the change of Lara's character design. In this game, she looks human, sleek and gorgeous. In the following games, she looks completely different, almost plastic and, in my opinion, way less attractive. Though attractiveness isn't an important aspect, I felt like I lost my wife, so it did affect me quite a lot. It didn't feel like the Lara I knew, since I played this one so many times before moving onto the other ones. I love the graphics of this game. Whilst they are not as amazing as the other games' were, they're charming and still make me feel like I'm right there, struggling with Lara. ✧˖°.

 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ જ⁀➴ 「  𝒮𝓉𝑜𝓇𝓎 𝓁𝒾𝓃𝑒:」

╰ ⊹₊˚ ໒ As for the atmosphere, this game completely encapsulates you in the story. It is self contained, moves at the perfect pace and I didn't need to skip any cut scenes, since I was genuinely interested in watching them. The story of Himiko was very interesting and I was eager to learn more about it. 
The main thing for me was, that I didn't have to hear the word ""Trinity"" even once. 10/10.
(In the other games, you'd hear them say that word at least once in every single cut scene. Perfect for if you want to find a reason to kill yourself that night or blow your ear drums out.) 

Which brings me to my next point, Lara's personality and likeability. ✧˖°.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀જ⁀➴「 𝐿𝒶𝓇𝒶:」

╰ ⊹₊˚ ໒ In this game, I could feel empathetic towards Lara, her voice acting was perfectly executed, you could feel her emotions and sympathise with her. Her morals were still in the right place, even though she was killing many enemies but was considerable towards innocent people. (In shadow, Lara's ignorance towards the people who were killed in the apocalypse she caused almost made me uninstall the game right then and there and set my computer on fire.)
When using survival instincts she wouldn't repeat the same thing over and over, or practically tell you what to do, even on easy mode. (MASSIVE dig at the following games.) ✧˖°.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀જ⁀➴ 「 𝒮𝒾𝒹𝑒 𝒸𝒽𝒶𝓇𝒶𝒸𝓉𝑒𝓇𝓈:」

╰ ⊹₊˚ ໒ The side characters were interesting, (Live laugh Roth.) and not once did I hear myself go ""I don't give a shit."" or ""Speed it up."" when they'd be talking. (This happened a lot in the other two games.)
When they'd interact with Lara, I could feel the connection they'd have and the conversations felt genuine and personal. Didn't feel myself zoning out even once, bravo!
I really liked Alex's character, and I was sad when he died in the Endurance. Wish it was Reyes instead. (Sorry.) 
Matthias wasn't a particularly interesting character, more of a bald annoyance but I think it was necessary for you to absolutely hate someone and enjoy watching them die. (Speaking of which, where the fuck did Lara's double guns go in the following games after she killed Matthias with them?)
My only problem would be that they killed off my favourite side characters. (Roth & Alex.) ✧˖°.

╰ ⊹₊˚ ໒ I liked every place in the entire map. Maybe my least favourite would be shantytown, only because it would confuse the hell out of me. The forests would also get a bit confusing, but I did like them nevertheless. 
Finding caches was a pain in the ass, but it allowed for thorough exploration that really expanded on the game. As well as finding relics, that was my favourite. ✧˖°.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀જ⁀➴ 「 𝒯𝑜𝓂𝒷𝓈:」

╰ ⊹₊˚ ໒ I wish there were a few more tombs, maybe ones a bit harder to find, but I did like them. They weren't difficult to complete, but some had me screaming into my pillow. However the rewards were worth it as it allowed for quite a few modifications. Though I do feel that there wasn't nearly enough of them, and there should've been more in the main story line, instead of ""optional"". ✧˖°.

[h3] Before she raided tombs... [/h3]

This is Tomb Raider 2013, another of a series of alternate universe reboots for the Tomb Raider ip. This is a fantastic game! And, surprisingly, an excellent tech demo for a physics model as well as a great bench marking tool for gaming PCs up until ~2017.

[h3] +Pros [/h3]
+Excellent action and game play mechanics. If you have played the original 'The Last of Us' on PlayStation 3, at or around the time of this release, then you have essentially played this game.
+Excellent story about Lara discovering her purpose in life after a traumatic event.
+Excellent setting, the story takes place on an abandoned post WW2 area mixed with weird sci-fi religious themes.
+Good combat. Scavenge and survive!
+Fantastic graphics for the time, and they are pretty good now as well.
+Excellent spatial awareness in the sound design, with very clear cues for just about everything. The sound scape is also masterfully dynamic with the way an environment warps sounds.
+Story focused character upgrades, with a side of additional equipment unlocks that you don't need to grind to achieve. This skill tree is very similar to classic Assassin's Creed, ergo Brotherhood and Revelations.
+A good balance between exploration and backtracking, which is quite difficult to master. Finding everything in this game is achievable, and even though that aspect is busy work at its core, its at the perfect balance.

[h3] ~Neutrals [/h3]
~Not a fan of the physical aspect of the setting. At the time, I was playing quite a few games that had either a tundra setting or a desert setting, and it was a period thing. In 2012-2014, games were trying to pioneer new tech and work with Vulkan and DX11. The forefront was getting the game to run smoothly, at the expense of details. This game unfortunately fell into this category. Not a con due to the fact that lately, this setting and theme are quite unique, but back when this released it was part of a dozen.

[h3] -Cons [/h3]
-The borderline torture of Lara really goes overboard in some of the action sequences, and somehow she just troops through it. I understand this is a game, but getting impaled right at the start of the game and then literally sleeping it off on a freezing mountain top cliff isn't something I believe anyone is capable of. That is coming from me, someone who has overcome being crippled and paralyzed from a motorcycle collision.
-Very serious adult themes are shown and illustrated in this game without warning. I understand that shock media is effective at portraying the story, but I was very surprised to see some extreme themes SUDDENLY.

Tomb Raider (2013) is an absolute banger of a reboot! Crystal Dynamics really snapped, giving us the lowdown on Lara Croft's glow-up.

This game suffers from a lot of ""old game moment"" especially on the PC, there are tons of game breaking bugs such as freezing and broken cutscenes that hinder the experience quite a bit. Along with this, you're dealing with clunky movement through the environments, and a camera with effects that give you VR esque motion sickness, leading me to drop the game and take a break considerably often.

Despite these complaints there's quite a bit I liked about the game as well. The story was engaging and the environments were a joy to explore and find goodies, (even with the clunky movement) especially shanty town, which was an absolute treat to explore.

Gioco oggettivamente mal sviluppato: a distanza di 10 anni la versione nativa per linux ancora non si avvia e tramite proton soffre di uno stuttering terrificante, anche gli utenti windows sono costretti a giocare con un client beta a causa di un bug che sposta fuori dallo schermo alcuni elementi di UI, mi é capitato inoltre di dover ricaricare piú volte la partita durante le mie 10h di gioco a causa di bug che non mi permettevano di avanzare con la storia; mi ha riportato con la mente ai tempi del buggatissimo Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness. 

[SPOILER]
La storia discreta, ma totalmente orfana di colpi di scena e di idee particolarmente originali non riesce a compensare alle gravi mancanze narrative: il contesto di trama viene ficcato forzosamente tra le prime fasi di gioco in maniera sbrigativa il che sbilancia il ritmo della narrazione non permettendo ai personaggi di avere una finestra decente per essere presentati; dovrebbe essere un reboot quindi si dovrebbe partire da zero, ma sin dall inizio l equipaggio sembra in gran parte composto da cheerleaders che fanno il tifo per Lara con un entusiasmo quasi infantile, fastidioso e totalmente ingiustificato; i dialoghi sono noiosi, pieni di frasi vuote e il voice acting di basso livello non aiuta a far emergere personaggi la cui scrittura piatta e costruita su cliché visti e rivisti centinaia di volte risulta stucchevole giá durante la prima sessione di gioco. Il risultato é che la morte dei compagni di Lara non suscita mai nessun tipo di emozione o trasporto, sono arrivato alla fine del gioco stanco e incapace addirittura di godermi il richiamo, presente nel finale, alla Lara iconica che brandisce due pistole. Unica nota positiva sotto questo punto di vista é stata l evoluzione di Lara nella scena finale che apre le porte per i capitoli futuri.",1705620046,1705620046,False,1,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

+ Graphics and audio design don't pale in comparison to much newer games. Textures are really well done and objects look smooth.
+ I've read people saying the puzzles are easy, but to me they were suitably challenging.

Cons:
- UI takes some time to get used to - especially the map is clunky to use.
- Due to an unfixed bug, the UI elements are often off the screen.
- There is no manual save option, only automatic. It's not possible to back to earlier parts of a playthrough. I would have liked to cancel a weapon upgrade or watch cutscenes again, but I couldn't.
- The game does not explain some of its features at all (for example, what is GPS Cache?)
- Although the game is open world, it feels linear - there are no side missions or any remarkable action outside the story.
- In stealth situations, enemies do not often react even if Lara is within their view. This obviously ruins the immersion.
- The environments feel empty and unrealistically quiet when not in combat. But when in combat, the game is often too intensive and overwhelming (especially the melee combat). The balance is not good.
- Travelling between different sections of the island is only possible via camp fire (why not mountain passages, caves or rivers?)
- It feels like the weapon upgrades do not have much effect in the game.
- Some inconsistencies / confusing things in storytelling.
- Stereotypical characters (especially Alex and Grim).

I had to restart it like 20 times cause my screen would get stuck (I was playing on ultimate graphic settings). Fix was to reduce it to low and then play it. 

But real question is, was it worth the trouble? Yep, definitely. I enjoyed the game back then and still do. If not for the camera sway and occasional bugs, the game is 100% worth playing even in 2023.",1704916530,1704916530,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Super fun game with a well told story set on a beautiful mysterious island that I had a blast exploring. It depicts Lara's origin story, how she became the badass archeologist we all know and love and this is one helluva epic depiction.
The game looks, sounds and plays great. I also really like the UI and the music, it's ambient, epic and emotional, felt appropriate for this ""A survivor is born"" journey. Adding to that the acting is stellar and the animations are incredible. You can ""feel"" the weight of what she fights through here because it's masterfully presented, I often found myself clenching my teeth and recoiling from the shit Lara had to go through.

Good:
+ Great graphics and optimisation. Tomb Raider looks and runs beautiful on just about any PC hardware.

+ Dark story and gritty atmosphere, Lara is John McClane of the jungle, she gets no rest and you genuinely worry about the well-being of her character.

Not so good:
- Wish more people were still playing multiplayer. Sadly, I never got the chance to fully experience it when it came out.

I almost hated everything about it, except for the gameplay, which is fun. Actually it was fun enough for me to 100% it, and that has barely even happened to me with any other game! But the story, oh man, the lame throwaway characters and Lara. Oh Lara, what have they done to you? From a strong silent female icon into a whiny and annoying teenager with psychological issues who never shuts the f*** up and keeps endangering her companions over and over again. The plot points are quite absurd; everything explodes and watching Lara stab someone in the head with an arrow, or falling down to a pit filled with spikes and impaling herself, or watching her rise from a pool of blood and gore (really, it happens) doesn't quite fit the Tomb Raider style, and I'm saying this when I barely even touched the originals! Am I playing Tomb Raider or god damn Resident Evil here!? 

Anyway, despite all that, the game is enjoyable, and playable. It's dumb downed lame action clichés of the 2010's era of gaming, the absolute worst of it, but it's ok. After all, I finished it completely. Thankfully, they made the sequel to be much better, subtle and way more alike the classic Tomb Raiders.

The 2nd installment in this series is my favorite, they really hit their stride in terms of gameplay flow and story, whereas the 3rd game was too long and too woke. I'm playing on an Apple with an M1 Pro processor, which leaves me with limited available titles, the Tomb Raider series and Resident Evil games are the best available in my estimation (also loved Metro Exodus), and I prefer the story and more responsive controls in the Tomb Raider games.

I have never played a Tomb Raider game before. But being a big fan of the Uncharted series, and the Arkham series, which were both starting out around the same time (or just grown massively), I wanted to give this a try. This game was phenomenal, the combat is extremely smooth, climbing, transitions, cut scenes, all very smooth and well done. I give full appreciation to the detail in this game, and how the quality feels very similar if not the same as an uncharted game, and the game play of the Arkham games. Also kept par with graphics for 2013. For a good 10 hours of gameplay for the story, worth it 100%. But considering it is only 4 dollars when on sale, you can't get much better for 4 dollars on Steam.

On the other hand the story doesn't bring anything new to the table and compared to the sequel ""rise of the tr"" it's weaker in every aspect. 

I would say if you're a fan of the tomb raider series and are interested in the first part of the squaresoft reboot even if the story is not that thrilling like in the later 2 games get it! You won't regret it. If you want a polished title in todays standards and you're easily dissapointed then you should be careful.. double that if you're up to finish games 100% cause...

...the ""bonus"" here is the multiplayer (and with the mp there are mp achievements) and thats a huge nono for completionists since the multiplayer is dead af and you're forced to grind round about 20 hours of braincellkilling private match self abusement solo games that are not supposed to be played like this... dont get me wrong. The storymode is dope especially in relation to its release date.. in looks AND gameplay. Really enjoyed the action with some john wick ost in the background.. but as I said.. for me as a completionist this multiplayer shit is just torture and lets be honest that mp was shit since day one.. there's a reason they retried a very different attempt on rise of the tomb raider.. and finally avoided mp in shadow of the tomb raider completely (big thanks for that!!)

Sad to say, the original PS1 version had more enjoyable game play.

Decent enough graphics, for a game this age and a story that I'd kinda like to play through (despite characters that are written without any feeling of depth or intelligence), but the frustrating game mechanics are probably earning this game an uninstall before I even play two hours...

6/10 for the art
3/10 for story so far
2/10 for the almost Gang Beasts-esque level of character control

Not recommended, unless you have a nostalgia for bad game mechanics.

I want to say that overall, Tomb Raider 2013 appealed to me, even though it's an absolutely awful game in the sense that gameplay is practically absent here. I can't call shooting bots and climbing painted walls gameplay. It's not even platforming. It's just pressing or holding down a single button. The crafting here is also very primitive, involving collecting one type of component throughout a level, then upgrading your weapons at specific upgrade points.

On the positive side, the action scenes are very well executed. There are many of them, and at some point, they become interesting to watch. Another positive is the combination of various types of action scenes into one prolonged cut scene. The impact of shooting bots is executed quite nicely; it's fun to shoot tin cans in the head. That's all the good stuff here.

There are sooo many bugs. There could be a gameplay cut scene where Lara stands in the forest telling some story, and in the background, due to a bug, a deer could just suddenly knock her down. It was very funny. Sometimes, a door that a bot kicked got stuck in the doorway, and I couldn't progress through the story, so I had to reload from a save. Sometimes Lara would fall from a rope in a gameplay cutscene. In short, there are many bugs, but overall, it's playable.

The story. If you've ever read at least one book in your life, any classic, you'd be astonished by how primitive everything is here; it's on the level of cartoons for children not older than 10. I'm not kidding; there's a moment when Lara loses a friend on a mission and returns to her camp. They ask her where her friend is, and she says he's dead. At first, they start criticizing her, and then a guy says, ""Shh, shh, I can't make decisions on an empty stomach, let's eat some fish."" And after dinner, another person says at least there was some positive moment today. So, their friend died 5 minutes ago, they sat down to enjoy dinner, and they already forgot about him. That's some amazing drama, I must say...
There's a moment where bandits bring Lara to their camp, leave her there, and say, ""Just don't run away,"" and then 20 seconds later, they're yelling that she escaped and searching for her throughout the camp. It's incredibly absurd.

My conclusion: It's a terrible game, a terrible story, but with very cool action cut scenes. And I'm even considering buying the next part.",1704129020,1704129020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
+ Absolutely stunning graphics.
+ Lara Croft looks gorgeous.
+ Numerous cutscenes with excellent animation and voice acting.
+ Cinematic gameplay with linear narrative.
+ Well optimised and has very few bugs (which are non game-breaking and disappear when reloading the save).
+ Intuitive control with an Xbox controller.
+ Well designed auto-save system. It even automatically saves mi-puzzle or after finding each collectible. So the penalty of death is only one or two minutes of retrying.
+ Four weapons to choose from. Bows are such a pleasure to use!

Pros or Cons, depending on your taste:
+ The player is very well guided. Some examples are given by the three next points.
+ “Survival instinct” allows you to see enemies, interactable objects, climbable walls, places to advance the story, and collectibles in your surroundings.
+ The world is mostly linear, so it is not too difficult to find your way through the map, even though the texture of objects from the same location is very similar and not that distinguishable. In fact, usually you just keep moving forward, which is the only possible direction because the other three are blocked by insurmountable objects. On the other hand, exploration is very limited since paths are mostly prescribed.
+ Puzzles are very light-weighted, including those in the optional tombs. Besides, Lara gives you verbal hints about how to proceed.
+ Metroidvania influence. Some places or collectibles are only accessible when you have the necessary gears. So getting new equipment also unlocks more ways to explore the map.
+ By well-balancing and interspersing puzzles, free roaming, action events, and cutscenes, the game keeps players engaged.
+ Depending on how much time you spend on collectibles, side quests, and option tombs, a typical first playthrough takes 10–20 hours. IMO, this is just the right length to avoid being dragging or repetitive.
* Your skills and weapons can be upgraded. You will be fully (or almost) upgraded at the end, even without much farming.
* Very few side quests.
- Quick-time events are such a pain, even on Easy mode. And some puzzles also require jumps with good timing.
- The plot is meh and contains supernatural elements. But I like the depiction of how Lara grows from a feeble lass to a strong and independent [strike]mass killer[/strike] tomb raider.
- You are still free to roam after the end. However, apart from collectibles and optional tombs, there is not much else to do, and enemies rarely spawn. The whole island feels empty, bleak, and lonely.

Serious Cons for completionists:
- Highly missable achievements that require a second playthrough to get.
- Tons of difficult-to-find collectibles necessary for certain achievements, some have no sense at all in the background setting of the game (I am looking at you, [spoiler]GPS caches![/spoiler]) some are even not shown on the in-game map.
- 30% of the achievements are related to the multiplayer mode, which is dead on arrival and not even available on macOS.

Final words:
Tomb Raider is a great game. Its story, gameplay, design, characters, graphics, all go very well together to give you a leisurely enjoyable experience, even for newcomers to 3A action games. Provided that you are not a completionist, I would say that it is a no-brainer to pick up this game. Besides, Tomb Raider is the first title of the second reboot (aka the Survivor Trilogy) of the Tomb Raider franchise. It has modern graphics, aesthetics, and gameplay design. So this is also the right starting point for anyone new to the franchise.

PS:
None of the DLC is actually useful. So if you want to save a few bucks, just buy the base game instead of the GOTY version.",1641280168,1704121624,True,5,0,0.577074527740478516,0,True,False,False

The QTEs are immensely annoying and serve no real purpose. You would think QTEs are to emphasize player control, but they often take your control away and dump you in a cutscene immediately after. The first 30 minutes are basically alternating between QTEs and cutscenes. 

Then you get your first fetch quest. Oh hey we've hidden these dumb boxes really far away to make this tedious. Of course we could let your starting axe open the third door you attempt to pry with it, but let's not be reasonable here.

2. DLC Tomb WILL glitch out if you complete in any unintended order

3. There are multiplayer achievements; this is an issue due to MP servers being taken offline..for many years.

Add to that a crash to desktop bug near the beginning, a terrible ending sequence where death puts you back to just before an unskippable cutscene, annoying QTEs, and a bizarre save system where checkpoints can save before campsite save points, but when loading the save the game gives you a warning, gaslighting you into loading an earlier save.

On top of that despite all the media and messaging saying that Lara isn’t sexualised, she is still incredibly sexualised. At least the original Tomb Raider knew what it was doing and was honest about it.

A fun action game that has some heart.  I like Lara very much she goes through a lot in the game the cutscene violence is gruesome and at times hard to watch.  The antagonist is forgettable but the elements of mysticism and history throughout the game are very cool.  This game suffers from a lot of ""Assassins Creed"" climbing syndrome vacuum to a wall and press the analogue in a direction to go very boring game design, the puzzles and optional tombs were disappointingly easy and short with all being solvable in less than 2 minutes.

Graphics (★★★★☆):

Tomb Raider boasts breathtaking visuals, showcasing detailed environments and character models. The island setting is both lush and dangerous, creating a visually stunning backdrop for Lara Croft's adventure. The attention to detail in animations and the dynamic weather system contribute to an overall immersive visual experience.

Gameplay (★★★★☆):

The gameplay in Tomb Raider is a strong blend of exploration, puzzle-solving, and action. Lara's character development from a vulnerable survivor to a capable adventurer is well-executed. The platforming sequences and puzzle design are engaging, providing a good balance between challenge and accessibility. The combat mechanics, while not groundbreaking, are solid, making firefights and stealth sections enjoyable.

Story and Characters (★★★★☆):

The narrative in Tomb Raider is a standout feature. The story of Lara's origin and transformation into the iconic adventurer is compelling and emotionally charged. The character development is well-paced, and Lara's vulnerability adds depth to her journey. The supporting cast complements the narrative, making for a memorable storytelling experience in the rebooted series.

Sound and Music (★★★★★):

The audio design in Tomb Raider is exceptional. The sound effects, ambient noises, and voice acting contribute to a rich and immersive atmosphere. The musical score enhances the emotional impact of key moments, creating a cinematic experience. Lara's grunts and gasps during intense situations add a layer of realism to the overall audio presentation.

Replayability (★★★☆☆):

While the story-driven nature of Tomb Raider may limit its replayability compared to open-world games, the inclusion of collectibles, challenge tombs, and alternate paths in the game world encourages exploration. The sense of discovery and the desire to uncover every secret may entice players to revisit the island, but the linear structure may deter some from multiple playthroughs.

Overall Rating (★★★★☆):

Tomb Raider successfully revitalizes the iconic franchise with a gripping narrative, stunning visuals, and a well-balanced mix of exploration and action. The character development of Lara Croft and the emotional depth of the story set it apart. While the linear structure may limit replayability for some, the overall package delivers a thrilling and memorable gaming experience for fans of action-adventure games. Lara's origin story is a triumph, and Crystal Dynamics' reboot sets a strong foundation for the future of the series.",1667621084,1702617906,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

[spoiler] Apparently i wasted +30 minutes in the beginning of the game where i was dragged into a cave and lifted up to hang from the ceiling where you are told to use Left & Right to swing with the momentum without it working, i was doing it perfectly but nothing was happening which made me look this up in Steam Discussions & Reddit and i found absolutely nothing to help me.

Then i watched walkthroughs and noticed that next to Lara is supposed to be another hanging body that you will bump into within 4-5 swings which will then catch on fire allowing you to start swinging vertically, problem was that i did not have that hanging body there to begin with, only after i closed the game and restarted it and made a new game it suddenly appeared and i was able to finally start playing the game.

There were many ways they could've messed up, but I believe they made a really interesting story with many interesting little parts to it like the journals and artefacts you can pick up. I'm disappointed about what I heard about the sequel, but if they don't want my money then sod them.

This is well worth it, especially on a sale!

Edit: The game is a reboot of the whole Tomb Raider series where Lara Croft goes to investigate one of these mythical locations, theorised by her father, with her friends in the hopes to find a lost archaeological discovery that has eluded people for generations, but instead they found that mythology has a lot more basis in reality than they ever realised!

With this situation and Lara being put into the most intense of situations, she goes from merely a smart rich girl, to a bad-ass survivalist who ends up with a lot of blood on her hands of both animals for survival and humans in regards to defending herself, her friends and saving others.

In all, this is meant to have been a origin story for a reboot of the Tomb Raider series and I feel that they had certainly achieved this whilst creating a fun new story too.",1446239713,1701868712,True,3,0,0.558278858661651611,0,True,False,False

This game was an absolute blast to play. Seriously, the story was interesting with unique characters that have pretty decent depth and it definitely had me invested. The voice acting is believable, the soundtrack's pretty awesome, traversal is fun with decent freedom and engagement, and at times, the platforming makes you feel like an absolute boss. Also, the way this game is structured and with the cinematography is quite engaging, giving you the feeling of really being on this ride with Lara. The environments were varied and absolutely stunning and the atmosphere was pretty fitting and immersive. The puzzles were fun and sometimes elaborate though mostly pretty easy. Also, the graphics have held up really well considering it's an almost 9 year old game, mostly with playing it on PC. The combat is also quite well thought out and just really fun.

Coming to the combat, this game has some pretty darn good variety, allowing you get a bit creative from time to time with the way you approach a given combat scenario. And while the AI isn't the smartest, it's also not the worst either, depending on the difficulty, they really do force you to keep moving and employ tactics to take them down. The enemies clearly are trying to kill you and they're pretty good at it. The stealth isn't actually as bad as I had thought and was pretty fun and the upgrade system for your character and weapons felt genuinely substantial, leading to satisfying player progression.

The amount of content in this game is just awesome (took me about 25 hours to beat) and I really did just have a blast all the way through. Even the side missions were fun, which, by the way, take the form of tombs that you can explore (the same goes for the DLC), solving their puzzles to uncover their hidden treasures. The collectibles and journal entries (which are all voiced) were actually interesting and uncover a lot of lore surrounding the history behind the places you're visiting (as well as info and backstories of some of the characters) and it gave me a pretty good reason to find them other than just for achievements. and concerning the ending, a lot of foreshadowing was actually made through the collectibles and journal entries. Lastly, the online is actually surprisingly fun, which is why it saddens me to see it pretty much dead.

Overall, I wholly recommend this game. I found it to be a great experience with great storytelling and I had tons of fun with it and plus, I got this game with all the DLC's for 6 bucks CAD on a sale which is an absolute steal and worth every penny. Of course though, this game isn't perfect and I do have a few gripes with this game including some of the achievements, which, were honestly quite ridiculous and super annoying to get and that the AI wasn't the best (though still totally adequate and still better than a lot of other triple a games **Ahem Far Cry 5**).

This game definitely deserves a [b]9.5/10[/b]

Adventure found me.

'Tomb Raider' is the reboot of the beloved series of adventures featuring the fearless woman Lara Croft. In this game however.

Lara is NOTHING like she used to be, she is weak, scared, unexperienced and had just graduated. She does not go out raiding tombs and treasures, because she wants to, she just gets thrown into this life by destiny. When she and her comrads sail to the island Yamatai to film it and discover some 'treasures' for money, their ship gets caught in a mysterious storm and everyone gets seperated. Now it's up to you, to find your friends and escape this island. Throughout the game you need to learn how to hunt, fight, craft new weapons, survive... and sometimes raid tombs... in order to get out of there alive. Lara quickly learns, that the island and it's presence is her greatest enemy. The animals are not the only ones, that want Lara dead, but also an ancient army (which I'm not gonna go into more detail here) and fearsome hunters who inhabit the dangerous island.

Tomb Raider is a solid singleplayer third-person action adventure with a catching story, great gameplay and beautiful visuals. 

The gameplay does remind alot of the 'Uncharted' series, which is not a bad thing, considering the games are both similar. A multiplayer mode, similar to 'The Last of Us' multiplayer is also included, but not a big highlight and definately not needed. If you think of buying the Game of the Year edition, there's no need in doing so, since it only comes with one 5 minute tomb and TONS of useless multiplayer skins, which noone needs anyways.

I strongly recommend 'Tomb Raider' to everyone who likes action adventures like 'Uncharted' and games with great gameplay and graphics.

Far less puzzles and no annoying, stiff camera that makes you want to drink bleach. There are some puzzles and stuff that makes you use the old brain but nothing that overstays its welcome - thankfully - if I wanted to use my brain I'd go back to school. The previous games were ALL just one big headache - constantly battling the camera and failing jumps you should realistically have been able to make. In this game, there's none of that. Everything just works. Everything makes sense. It's fluid and just lots of fun. If you're like me and were never able to stomach the previous games then yeah, I 100% recommend this.

Pros and Cons

[b] Pros [/b]

+ The graphics are amazing - blood, dirt, grime and injuries appear on Lara over time. There's hair physics! The views are pretty breathtaking and the world is just awesome to run around in. 
+ Nice soundtrack.
+ Character movement and climbing is user friendly and precise.
+ Semi open world with fast travel.  
+ Fun collectables including relics which you can inspect and manipulate for a closer look.
+ Fun and diverse combat with optional stealth - the stealth is a bit meh but works well enough. You can go guns blazing with the assault rifle or snipe your enemies from afar with the bow or use a silenced pistol Splinter Cell style or even sneak up behind enemies and kill them that way or by using the environment - and so much more!
+ Lots of epic moments - an action packed, adrenaline fuelled adventure - imagine if Michael Bay directed a Tomb Raider movie! It'd be this game.
+ The weapon upgrade system is cool with weapons becoming more fancy over time as you upgrade them.
+ An actual story - a story of survival. But there's also plenty there to sate you appetite for adventure and discovery - learning about the island and its history through journals, relics, exploring tombs and so on.

Yeah, sometimes I felt like I was playing Assassin's Creed or something!

Another good thing is that after you beat the game, you can go back and collect any collectables you might've missed so don't worry about them too much. Enjoy the story! Relax. I enjoyed it so much I beat the game over the course of 2-3 days and 100%'d the single player.

[b] Cons [/b]

- There's a lot of QTE's and I blame them for 99% of my deaths. Sometimes they just don't work or don't really make it clear what you're supposed to do or what button you're meant to press. I guess the camera (in these situations) can still get in the way.
- The game can be a bit buggy at times with collectables not appearing until you leave and reenter the area (that's a little pro tip - what worked me anyway - same with that glitched DLC tomb).
- There's no new game plus.
- The multiplayer appears to be dead.
- There's no player vs AI bots mode in multiplayer.

Those last two would've been nice and could've added some more hours of gameplay I think.

I recommend playing with an Xbox 360 controller. The QTE's are easier to understand then and well, in my opinion, it just feels a lot more natural.

Overall, absolutely worth it and a bargain if you get it now while it's on sale. £10 or under - 100%!

A fast paced third person shooter mixed with a touch of QTE that feels just right. The game understands pacing so as much action as it dishes out, it knows when to take a break so you can process what's happened. The gunplay is solid and responsive. There are better iterations of this, but this is a solid take that will take you through the entire game. Navigating through different areas with the use of different tools to navigate areas is a very nice touch and will scratch a lot of itches when it comes to exploration. The leveling system feels just right and avoids using silly damage numbers in a non-mmo game.

[h1]The Story:[/h1]
The story is engaging with characters that are interesting and believable. The pacing mentioned earlier plays a big role here, it is done in such a way that carries the narrative without actually moving too fast or too slow. It even incorporates a bit of mystery which is a nice touch. All the characters are developed enough to understand each one of their motives and even grow to like or hate them. The use of diaries from different time periods makes the story of what's happen feel like the world exists outside of what Lara does in it. They even hinted at some history that would make a great game/movie on it's own with her dad. Perhaps one day we will see Father Croft, Roth and Grim bring a bunch of badasses. 

[h1]The Visuals:[/h1]
This a visual theme park and actually still looks great even by today's standards. It's often been used as a benchmark for how good a computer runs, so I would say they had to do a good job. The enviorment is both a visual spectacle and very iconic, where I can tell what part of the game someone is at by a mere glance.  Most important is the attention to detail on Lara herself. Much like in the batman Arkham series, Lara will gain wounds through out the story and they will show. This slow but sure battering of your character is adds to overall experience. 

[h1]The Sound:[/h1]
The music is a real winner here, they made a custom track that would carry the entire story and even the series itself. The effect this has cannot be overstated, it's one of the often overlooked pieces where some games just slap on some decent music that feels disjointed from the game. This on the other hand with it's music feels like a unified experience. The voice acting of all characters, major and minor are absolutely pivotal. Lara's voice actor in particular had done an incredible job.


[h1]The Experience:[/h1]
Once upon a time I had mildly enjoyed the old Tomb Raider, although it was mostly because I felt like I had to play it due to the marketing. In all honesty the experience was alright and as such any new game that came out just immediately fell under the radar. This particular reboot in how the gameplay is modernized and brought to a state of semi realism did wonders. Instead of the graceful dual wielding 7 star heroine, we find someone who struggles, feels pain is hurt a lot but bears through all of that. A complaint some detractors would have is that she complains too much - I would like to see them go through half of that without muttering a single gripe. The super human gets boring, this new Lara is how I will remember Tomb Raider, we need more like this.",1700343873,1700344184,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They were revolutionary back then. So after many years away from gaming, one of the first franchises I returned to was Tomb Raider.

The essence was the same, mind you, the spirit of the original was still there, not the execution, the tools at the developers disposal and the finished product were absolutely mind blowing. I am so glad I came back to gaming after almost 20 years. This game alone made the return and even the years away worthwhile.

It's like watching an action movie, but with more controller button mashing and fewer complaints about my popcorn distribution skills.

The graphics are a glorious upgrade from the pixelated past, where Lara's every move looked smoother than my attempts at impressing her with dance moves. It's like witnessing the evolution of Lara from triangular adventurer to a polygonal powerhouse—still with a knack for defying gravity.

The gameplay is a hilarious rollercoaster of jumps, falls, and the occasional ""Ouch!"" that makes every death a comedy act. It's like an improv show where the main character has a penchant for plummeting off cliffs, and the audience (me) gets a front-row seat to the spectacle.

The story is a nostalgic journey through Lara's rebooted origins, where my girlfriend embarked on a digital quest that rivaled Lara's own adventures. It's like being a side character in a blockbuster film, where the real hero is the one holding the controller.

In conclusion, Tomb Rider is not just a game; it's a time capsule of laughter, a reminder of Lara's evolution, and a testament to my girlfriend's virtual badassery.

She knows stuff, for sure, but has to figure out what to do in what order, which sets an environment for her to demonstrate what she can do to what degree and evolve into a leader and survivor along the game.

Compared to the other two games, this game is about seeing her confusion about her surroundings. Constantly asking questions, facing tough decisions, learning, changing, being a beginner, survivor, and a leader to survive on the island.

I would have liked to see that in the other two games as well - maybe I'll cut some slacks to the RORT, but SOTR is no excuse. You'll know what I mean once you play them.

The gameplay is very nice and fluid, with great mechanics. The map has places integrated into the story where you find yourself in a bloody ditch or a cave, fighting floods, exploring the island, or climbing up the clouds. It's just perfect.

Recently I decided to revisit it and explore what the game has to offer.
Typically when I'm playing a game I lean heavily into exploration: leaving no stone unturned and trying to explore every corner of the map.
With Tomb Raider it is pretty difficult to do. Levels feel corridor-like, limiting and constricting the exploration. That is especially so with prologue when you need to battle bad dudes in a burning building.
Maybe this is essential for a puzzle-focused game. But for example Talos Principle does not feel that claustrophobic even despite also being puzzle-focused. Even Portal despite de-facto being incredibly restrictive and devoid of exploration feels more airy and spacious.
Controls also don't feel as well thought out as they are in other games. I am finding myself mildly annoyed by the need to double-tap the space bar in order to perform a wall climb.
The plot so far is ok, but I did not get far to judge the entire story.
Eventually I decided not to force myself to finish the game just because I started it and to follow the fun.
As for graphics they are OK. I have seen games from the same period that aged significantly worse in terms of graphical fidelity (ahem FarCry 3 ahem).

The gameplay loop is fun, you do some platforming, some combat and you traverse a well build island you got stranded on by a storm, searching for a way off the island while simultaneously uncovering its secrets. The gameplay loop does get repetitive really fast. The devs tried to combat this by slowly opening up new ways to traverse the island, but it is not enough to save you from boredom. This game is best played in sittings of 1,5 to maximum 2 hours at a time.

Then there is a lot of early 2010's gaming quirks that you need to ignore in order to not lose the immersion because you can easily ruin the immersion by asking why, who and when. Why are there ropes around this beam? Who put these ropes here and why did they put the ropes here? The answer is always simple and it is the ropes are there so you can shoot an arrow with a rope into it, the devs put it there and they were put there during development. There is no other reason for the ropes to be there, same goes for a lot of other stuff.

This is still a fun game, and if you intent on playing the entire trilorgy I would certainly not skip this.

[h3]The Review:[/h3]
Dunno who will read this review. Recommended? The game on its own is not that bad, but I did not enjoy it, truthfully, so no. I was fed up several times and took days to pick it up again. Here are the details for playing on Hard:

The story, the characters and the combat is just so, soooo cheesy it's borderline annoying. Story going-through is convenience after convenience.

Lara Croft, a young adult with no real combat experience is handling weapons like a professional... with no background of handling weapons. That's a problem. She reloads faster than John Wick and is knowledgeable about weapons enough to ""upgrade"" them. Ph. Okay. In the end she has bigger body count than Rambo too. Way to go girl!

Enemies just run at you. Hiding behind a cover? Look at that head peeking out, BOOM headshot. Someone came close? Headshot. Dodge+finishoff or swap to shotgun if you wanna save ammo (you'd think), swap back to gun/bow and continue on the fire while barely taking any damage unless you expose yourself to someone with an automatic rifle (reason for all of my few deaths). After combat you loot most of your ammo back... Is this supposed to be Hard? No higher difficulty? Come on...

A young woman that does not workout can take on big men. Mhm. Yup. She's acting like a well seasoned climber without putting it in the backstory (again). Strong cold winds tear at her and Lara is climing the ice almost half naked. Yeah sell us the boobs! /facepalm

[b]AND I GET IT THAT ITS A VIDEO GAME![/b] And true, not all of the enemies you meet are with military background, but come on... Character Sam likes to record, and we don't have a single recording of Lara working out to keep in shape or some shooting range fun of any kind. That alone could've fixed Lara's character and I would not have as much of a problem, honestly. Or a flashback of her father or someone else teaching her how to handle weapons. ANYTHING really.

[h3]Tombs:[/h3]
And that's for the story and the shooting part of the gameplay. This is stil Tomb Raider, right?

Tombs are like this: walk straight, get a puzzle for a five year old, get ""treasure"" and exit via a shortcut. All of them. ""Tombs"" don't have labyrinths of any kind, no traps, no elaborate puzzles, no challenge whatsoever. Only one has something hidden but its also obvious, just maybe not in the heat of the battle.

[h3]In a nuthsell...[/h3]
While this is a negative review please understand that it is not that bad of a video game! Buy it if you want to explore the series like I am right now. It's 15€ game so its not a big purchase. Atm its on 80% sale for 3€ too, so buy it if you're interested.

I just know that I won't replay this. It's too easy and linear with no challenge and the story is very cheesy. It has its good and interesting moments but its too rare for me to enjoy. I hope the next game is designed better.

My only other reference point in terms of the wider TR franchise is really [I]Legend[/I] (2006).

Of course, that latter score seems the least fair here. [I]Tomb Raider's[/I] scope certainly doesn't match that of the later games in the series, but it's still a fundamental must play as an introduction to the trilogy and a very new and different Lara. Gone is the sassy, assured woman in her late 20s/early thirties, and in her place is a much younger Lara. A Lara who also feels a lot more real in her responses to the narrative. Lara runs the full gamut of fear, sympathy, loss, grief, rage and despair as she tries to see the crew of the [I]Endurance[/I] safely off the island of Yamataï where their expedition becomes shipwrecked.

Indeed, that crew is one aspect of the game to have aged less well. Contrary to the depth of characterisation here for Lara, many of the [I]Endurance's[/I] crew members feel one dimensional and in service to key plot points - and it feels like there are a lot of them as well. To widespread fan dismay, perhaps the most narratively promising of Lara's relationships, that with Sam, is disappointingly under-explored.

What has aged well (and indeed continued to mature from title to title) is the Metroidvania gameplay, with a steady drip feed of weapons, items and moves enabling Lara to access more and more of the island and strip away those 'gear needed, come back later' prompts that bar you from areas you want to access. [I]Tomb Raider[/I] plays well, like all my favourites, with verticality, and the shimmying, climbing and jumping are fantastic. Star of the show is of course the now-iconic bow, although in this entry it definitely feels less assured of its place, being relegated in my playthrough to a utility item while the pistol and assault rifle did the heavy lifting. On that former note, stealth is incredibly enjoyable even in this title, a mechanic that again matured greatly in future titles.

The game also feels really nicely paced - a head-scratching tomb explore here, an absolutely hellish transition to the next set piece there (let down a little by QTEs, it must be said) and then a big combat set piece next. All the while, Lara accrues experience and salvage to feed into perks and weapon upgrades. Both feel positively sparse in comparison to later titles, but players less appreciative of such systems will welcome the lighter touch here. I still admit to being unable to fathom when and how the game drops the pieces for weapons that change them into entirely better models, and the seeming randomness of this was frustrating.

There is no doubt in my mind that the later games did many things better. I preferred [I]Rise[/I]'s combat and [I]Shadow's[/I] scope and exploration, but I'd say that this has the tightest storyline of the lot, being less offering as it is of side quests and distractions. Those that there are in the form of challenge tombs do feel at times that they lack distinction.

It's an excellent starting point, and definitely the most pure and functional iteration of the formula.",1699198366,1699198366,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am a big Tomb Raider fan. Curiously enough, this is what makes it difficult for me to review this game. Let me say first that 'Tomb Raider (2013)' is a great game and an easy recommendation. As a game per se my vote is a 9/10, it is extremely fun to play. Despite having its fair share of flaws it is an immensely enjoyable ride. But - but: This is not a 'Tomb Raider' game, and 'Lara Croft' is not Lara Croft in this game. These are just labels tacked on.

The Good
- Great gameplay: Exploring, fighting, upgrading your avatar - all these are perfect.
- Fantastic level design, borrowing the 'hub' mechanics from no other title than 'Dark Souls'. After exploring different areas of the island, you always find ways back to earlier areas, interconnecting different parts and making it a real big whole world built in a very clever way.
- Interesting and engaging avatar. S.b. for more comments.
- Great objectives: Lara has to go through a series of challenging and constantly life-threatening chores, it is really a 'big adventure', just like the prologue says.
- Awesome soundtrack which even employs an instrument specifically built for this game.

Neutral
- Lots of explosions and over-the-top action sequences. It is a big spectacle, but don't expect any subtlety. Appreciating the aesthetics of Michael Bay definitely helps.
- Underwhelming ending and boss fight. Well, you can't have everything.
- Tomb raiding is moved to the background with 'optional' 'tomb' areas. This is the most blatant indicator for this game heavily borrowing from the 'Uncharted' franchise in the first place and then considering how to transmogrify the thing into a 'Tomb Raider' instalment.

The Bad
- Side characters and the antagonist a shallow cardboard pieces serving as mere placeholders for real characters. This is a big problem: Why should the player care about them? As 'Legend' and 'Underworld' already indicated, this game proves Crystal Dynamics is really not up to writing good characters.
- Crystal Dynamics cannibalizes the franchise with some badly written dialogue (""You're a Croft"" and other items like these). Given that this is an origin story, it is rather out of place. Lara and the player are supposed to earn this rather than being told before actually doing anything. It's funny that this is as bad as the companion feature film (the 'Tomb Raider' atrocity with Alicia Vikander) which treats us to gems like ""You are a real Tomb Raider"". Phew.
- Bad dialogue between the companions in general: Nobody can give a straight answer. There is much quarreling when they should be interested in forming a survival community above all else. Story design isn't Crystal Dynamics strength, either, although it is not as bad as the characterization department.

My personal beef: 'Tomb Raider 2013' isn't 'Tomb Raider' anymore
- While the gameplay is great, there is no resemblance to former platforming and puzzle solving anymore.
- Lara gets a new biography, a different set of characteristics and a more realistic appearance. You may hail this as progress, I do not.
- This is a hard reboot that changes almost everything with respect to earlier instalments while keeping some elements to cash in on former accomplishments. In my opinion, this game would have been even better, if they had moved it out of the franchise and gave the protagonist a different name and biography.
- To me Crystal Dynamics' approach is an unpleasant rumination of how US-American developers think a heroine from the British aristocracy should look and act like. Core Design managed to make Lara Croft tough, cool and sympathetic while letting her do things that were often anything but lady-like. For me that was one of the biggest appeals - and now this is quite irrevocably lost.",1698927741,1698927741,True,21,2,0.645743310451507568,0,True,False,False

This Game has some Flaws, especially the Quick Time Events, it was really hard to overcome this Issue, as you have to do the Stuff again and again and again. 
It seems it is even broken with Keyboard and Mouse, but you are mostly ""fine"" with a Controller. 

The second Elephant in the Room are the Characters, they aren't really good writen and it is a pure Embarrassment. 
The overall Scenario isn't bad, but it is a cringy Fest. 

What i also dislike is that the Physics of what Lara can reach and not is often lacking any Logic. 
She jumps and stops falling to dock onto were she is supposed to Land. 
The older Games, as TR1, feel here more logical and realistic.

To the Good:
The Graphics are really really really good and Laras Animations are outstanding.
The Game isn't as demanding, my 6700 XT is pretty quite and also my older 580 Pulse wasn't really under hard Pressure. 

The Gameplay also brings much Joy, especially when you are in Areas were you can decide if you go full Rambo or you bring the sneaky Death to your Enemies. 

It is also cleverly made that your Weapons have a second Mode that gives you something as the Granate Launcher.

In the End the Gun Play and the Presentation are overweighting the Quick Time Events and the weak Characters.",1575163116,1698617047,True,0,0,0.525190114974975586,0,True,False,False

But...I couldn't get it out of my head. I just kept coming back for more. With each playthrough, it started to click. The more I played, the more I loved it.

It's definitely a product of the time, doing something with Tomb Raider:Uncharted::James Bond:Jason Bourne. You can also tell how old I am by casually using analogy format. Anyway, Tomb Raider had been on the decline for a number of reasons, while the more ""cinematic"" and action-y Uncharted was on the way up. Also there were a lot of reboots and origin stories going around. 

So this is the game that took the aristocratic busty british adventuress and made her a post-grad student off as a junior member in her first major expedition. And man, they are not nice to her. She gets broken, hurt, tortured and just generally put through the ringer- and that's not even touching on the death animations. All of this, though, makes the character arc pretty satisfying for when she's on a rampage at the end. There's also the Katniss Everdeen ""girls with bows"" thing going on. 

Really, if you're considering the reboot Tomb Raider games, this is pretty good and is easily the budget choice. HOWEVER, if you're only going to get one, get Rise of the Tomb Raider. Without getting into specifics, Rise is the best combination of gameplay and story- especially with the side content.

What I got was an adventure game that felt more and more like something straight out of the Indiana Jones movies. 

The entire game is full of mystery and adventure. I had some good guesses as to what was going to happen next, but I was never able to get my guesses right on the money. The story, while a bit all over the place at times, holds up well. I was able to understand the events unfolding before me without any issue. I really enjoyed watching the emergence of the Croft name in Lara throughout the story. With every new tool, skill, weapon, or event; a little bit more of the Croft name appeared in Lara. This added a beautiful evolutionary tale to the game that I really enjoyed watching unfold. 

The game plays wonderfully. Nothing felt too convoluted or frustrating. In my eighteen hours I only came across two bugs. Of which only one was during the main path. Neither of which were game breaking in any way and were actually quite funny; one was even helpful. I really love the weapon uses and upgrades. The skill paths also do a lot for unlocking new ways to play. I found myself discovering all new ways to take out enemies even at the very end of the game. All of the combat was incredibly fun. Every encounter left me wanting more. The one thing I wish was used more was the instinct system. It's such an interesting part of the game and unfortunately is best used during optional parts of the game. 

The extra activities provided in the game are more than just wonderful. It's your usual collectathon type of thing so don't expect too many new things from it. The tombs are short but sweet, each one being memorable and none being too similar to another. The activities in some areas are my favorite part of the optional content. They all follow the same hide and seek rule set, but shake it up in different ways to keep things fresh. I can only count two as being too similar to each other. This is where the instinct mechanic shines the brightest. There were two of these though that did become more annoying than fun even with the instinct mechanic in play. One had me looking for something small that was obscured at ground level and the other had me looking somewhere that you'd never think to look. The latter being almost impossible to see without instinct. These are the only two I had to look up, but the rest were all fairly simple and fun to find. 

Tomb Raider has become one of my favorites that I've played this year and was enjoyable all the way through. I recommend it to anyone who's into action adventure games. If you're into the Uncharted series then this is a different, yet similar take on that formula so I definitely recommend that Uncharted fans check this one out.",1698466094,1698466094,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I bought Tomb Raider and completed it with the intent of enjoying a blockbuster cinematic interactive experience and I got EXACTLY what I asked for... :)

My last experience before this with Tomb Raider was when I played Tomb Raider III on PS1, which I completed, and then I played just a little of the next one, The Last Revelation... I was aware of the critical reception of all the subsequent titles. I can summize that they did a great job in bringing Lara into a new era.

If anything, some of the story-telling elements relied on some obvious tropes to convey an emotional message but for the most part it is what story-telling surmounts to ultimately. 

It is the extravagance of the story with suspension-of-disbelief fully engaged that makes the story a memorable and enthralling experience.

The gameplay is of course fluid and the movement and pace feels natural and there are a lot of rewarding gun-play segments and variety of set-pieces and locations that naturally progress with the story to then explore through and overcome, which all supplements to the emotional investment and immersion with the character itself, in essence what makes the player feel like its their journey as much as it is the character's to finish.

My Review    =   8.5 / 10

The beginning of the Tomb Raider series is very wonderful. If we want to talk about the game play, it was very beautiful and the character of Lara Croft was very proficient, but the story was not of the desired performance, but it was satisfactory in some scenes, and there were some viewing angles that were bad during game play, which makes you vulnerable to death in some cases, but the evaluation Overall this game was good considering it was a game released in 2014

The story is great and although the campaign is quite short, it really didn't FEEL like it was whilst I was playing it. The puzzles weren't super complicated and intuitive, (at least they were for me) and the mechanics were great for the SteamDeck once I turned the aim sensitivity down a bit.  

What I will note, is that if you play with subtitles on the SD it might be a bit hard to read... oh and some things are cut off on the right of the screen. But aside from that, was a good little story driven game for me to blast through.

It helps that my expectations were pretty low going into it. It was the same thing with Daredevil and Mission Impossible so that probably helps me like things more. But I was just like ""oh, hot chick shoots a bunch of bad guys, might be okay""
I started the game and I liked how it got straight into the action. I hate when things start out really slow. I liked that about the Dark Knight, too, and I think it really helps with the immersion imo
and you see all the characters yelling at each other on the beach and I thought that drama was kind of fun
And the first area of the game there are puzzles which I like
There's a lot of quick time events and the game borderline plays itself for the first section, but I still liked it because it still managed to be exciting (and it still is, even after years of playing)
And then you're introduced to some platforming and I thought it was really well done. To me the most important part of a video game is how pleasant the movement is. It's why I love Sly Cooper and partly why I love Marvel's Spider-Man, 2 of my favorite games
and the first area where you go along the cliff with the rain coming off the rocks is when I realized just how pretty the game is
to me, it's the perfect blend between realistic and stylized
And right before you get the bow, you go through a short box canyon and to the right there is a gps cache that shines white and it looks just like a moment from Darkest Faerie, another of my favorite games
When it opens up to that forest area, I was so impressed with how big it felt and yet it was clear everything was made by hand and with purpose and there are soooo many little details to find, I didn't think we'd have that technology. It reminded me of a dream game I came up with in 9th grade which was also a single player adventure game where you are stuck on an island fighting bad guys with an emphasis on platforming, it was like my dream game came true
And the cutscene where you kill the deer is where I started really getting intrigued because I love heroic characters and I'm a bit of an animal lover so the fact that she feels sad about something as simple as killing a deer to survive is something very interesting to me
All my expectations were already subverted which was fun
I love the optional tombs, it reminds me of the dungeons from Skyrim, another one of my favorite games, except all the tombs are better than any dungeon
I love the weapons system, it's very similar to Republic Commando which is another one of my favorite games and the combat is just as intense
By the time I reached the radio tower, it was already my favorite game but that's only 25% through so it was an incredible length I feel, even if it's short compared to the average game
I like that Lara's character stays a guilt-ridden idealist, my favorite archetype. I thought the villain was good because he exploits this several times, luring her into traps and yet the fact that she still comes out on top at the end is cool because it shows that morality has a place in survival. Spider-Man also had some positive messages like that. so I really like the story
Not just for the themes but also for the novelty. Lara as an archeologist comes across an island that has collected all kinds of artifacts, documents, etc. from people all over the world that date back centuries, millennia even. It's the perfect playing ground
And there's this weird feeling I get with certain scenes in movies but I felt it in many places throughout this game where it's almost like deja vu but more powerful. I see certain things and I get this feeling that I had always known about it. In that sense, I kind of feel I have some spiritual connection with the game, too
And looking back on it, another reason I like the game so much is how emotionally diverse it is. It's like, every emotion is there and it kind of combines into some weird new feeling
I also like the ending where she says she's not going home, it reminds of me of TDK trilogy. It's like she embraces the fear and trauma to strengthen her passion for life and academics.
The whole game really inspires me to be a better person in every aspect of my life, I think it's made me a much much better person in general
I left out a few things such as how the movement inspires my own exercise. IRL I want to run as easy as it is for me to hold a joystick forward and jump as easy as it is to press a button. Also, at my most motivated I always want to travel and I can play out that fantasy a little by playing the game. Also also, there were little things here and there that I wasn't expecting and who doesn't love a good twist? Things like being able to grab ledges that I didn't think I'd be able to or seeing how she climbs along ropes for the first time. I had never seen anything like that before; it was actually a little educational.
and that's why I like the game

The graphics are still pretty good. Even though the engine might be dated by today's standards, the performance is excellent at maximum settings and gets even better on modern PCs. More importantly, the art direction of the game results in very good looking characters and environments so it's pretty timeless.

Gameplay is... good in some ways. The basic progression mechanics for levelling your character and for improving weapons still hold up. The bow excels during moments of stealth, but I tend to use firearms once things get loud. The bow does get a late-game perk to allow for armor penetration to keep it relevant, though. The pistol's probably my most favorite weapon due to its accuracy for headshots, followed by the assault rifle, and finally the Shotgun, which I always felt lacked impact, even when fully upgraded.

However, the screen shake is kind of awful (you can get an aftermarket Yamatai patch to get rid of it), and what is really annoying is how the third-person camera auto-turns while you strafe. I also think that when you're not aiming, that having Lara in the center of the screen isn't exactly ideal, and while you can switch shoulders during aim mode, not having the side you were last using ""remembered"" is troublesome during tense fights in close quarters. Also, switching between first-and-third person views tends to nudge the camera around in ways that disrupts aiming. These problems are like little rocks in your shoes that disrupts an otherwise beautifully crafted experience and makes it hard to enjoy the gameplay experience they set out to present.

In the early game there are also a couple bugs, one requiring that you reload a checkpoint (a scripted sequence fails to trigger when trying to reach for the bow), and another involving having to shoot wolves that doesn't function well on an ultrawide display (so I had to switch to a 16:9 aspect ratio to get past that), and there are numerous quicktime sequences that I simply didn't enjoy because they used somewhat cryptic icons to distinguish between Melee and Use buttons. Also, if you need to turn on the spot, I suggest doing that while Aiming rather than trying to do that with walking. There were also a few instances where enemies would infinitely spawn until I either fled from an area (and they mysteriously stopped spawning) or I got overwhelmed and died, and upon respawning, the encounter was gone. Again, I must stress that these are just a few pain points that disrupt an otherwise pretty good experience.

Story-wise, it's passable, with a few clumsily-handled parts where a cutscene shows Lara having difficulty in situations that I would've otherwise had little trouble shooting my way out of. I get that the game is a bit like an interactive movie in these situations but I still found them jarring.

I suppose all in all, that I would give this a 8/10. It's fun, you can tell they really tried, but it's a little scuffed here and there which keeps it from being a really memorable masterpiece.",1696202023,1696202023,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First things first if this game had no bugs it would be a 8/10 immediate recommend. Unfortunately that's not the case, and I want to make it clear that you will encounter at least one bug if not many if you play this. I have left my initial reaction to this at the end of the review as it was very frustrating, particularly at the beginning. The story is amazing and whilst the game is very simple compared to it's sequels, if it worked how it was meant to it would be an amazing intro to the reboot series. However, this 10 year old game was patched as recently as 2022, yet it still contains many game breaking bugs including a cut off HUD, glitching and therefore impossible QTE's, and multiple areas where the only solution is to reload the checkpoint and hope you don't have to redo the section. Luckily there are many solutions to the many bugs in the forums, although you may have to try multiple solutions before finding one that works. Also you'll likely need to use the 2013 beta version to make it work. Also this game was designed to be played with a controller, and at times this really, really shows. It's possible to complete on keyboard (I did) but it is annoying that it doesn't work the way it should, especially when it comes to mouse movements and scrolling. 

Despite these incredibly frustrating bugs and flaws the story is annoyingly worth it, and I enjoyed the development of the characters. It is still a basic  concept, and I did have to wonder at Lara's stupidity for not understanding what the big bad was going to do until right at the last minute. It is incredibly gory, more so than Shadow (which I played first) and the optional tombs are really, really disappointing. They are so small that by the time you've got the hang of the mechanic it want's you to use you're done. Literally they're almost all one room in and out and done, not like the sequels. The multiplayers dead in the water, as is to be expected with an old game, but it's annoying that about 50% of the achievements are almost impossible now because they are part of the multiplayer.  

[b] Buy if: [/b]
- You like Shadow and/or Rise and want to know how it all started.
- It's in one of those mega bundles of every tomb raider game ever.
- You don't mind working around a lot of bugs to see the beginning of Lara's journey. 

[b] Don't buy if: [/b]
- You don't like bugs in games.
- You want to try out the revival. Try Shadow or Rise first, trust me. 
- You feel strongly about 100% achievements, as multiplayer pretty much prevents this.

*Original review left at 6.5 hours* As a warning to those thinking of buying this game, it is buggy as hell, has really annoying QTE's (where the solutions are buy a controller or turn the graphics down to low or up to ultra?!), and honestly I'm glad it looks like it's going to be short. Yes this game was made in 2013, but the most recent patch was in Sept. 2022. Did this patch help? NO! 10 years later and they still haven't patched out game breaking bugs, despite many updates.

By her suggestion and against Whitman's advice, the expedition ventures into the Dragon's Triangle. The ship is struck by a violent storm and sinks, stranding the survivors on the isolated island. Lara is separated from the others, on a godforsaken island, full of dangerous animals, extreme weather and an armed fanatic cult of a group of scavengers living in a mountainside village… Now, you should save everyone, find the tomb and then escape from this perilous island, but at what cost! Solve riddles, get skills, grab your bow (or any other kind of weapons, there’s plenty of it) and explore the places of an inhabited island!

To be honest, the graphics are so well-done here and the game itself works fine even now, but sometimes the game can crash (well, it crashes in the multiplayer for the most of the time).

In addition, there is a multiplayer (currently dead), where you can play some matches with your friends or random people to get some achievements or just have some fun.

The reboot is an excellent 3rd person adventure game. I had a ton of fun getting into every corner of the map which only gets unlocked over time as you get new gear. Sometimes, the levels were a bit too linear in my opinion, especially in the beginning, but most of the time it's fine.
You have the possibility to go stealth on enemies or go straight into Rambo mode. Depending on your gear, you can also use your environment to take enemies down or hiding yourself. The game encourages you to use your skill set.
I also like the character progression here. As you level up, you get skill points which you can spend them on buffs or new abilities.
The story is also entertaining enough to motivate you to finish the game.

Back in the days, the game was visually stunning. Nowadays, the magic a bit gone but still the graphics in this game are very good.

Compared to the OG Tomb Raider games, this one is very easy and relaxing, so the complete opposite. 

Performance-wise, I had solid 60 fps with an GTX 1060.
You can get this game for dirt cheap, I bought it for 2,99€ a few years ago.

I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a relaxing adventure exploration game with a solid story and visually appealing graphics.

It takes the franchise in a visceral new direction, planting a young inexperienced Lara into a vicious kill or be killed fight for survival. You'll tackle this desperate struggle by making your way across the island of Yamantai, slaughtering those who get in your way, running to safety in some explosive set pieces and taking on the occasional side quest in a tomb.

Almost all of it is immensely gratifying and cathartic with the game's heavy focus on combat and skill upgrades making the biggest impression. TR 2013 never lets up with its rip-roaring pace and a plot that really pulls you in to Lara's transformation from terrified archaeologist to hardened survivor. It does have issues here and there, most notably with the weak side characters and heavily simplified puzzles but the overall experience is rugged, intense and unrelentingly brutal. I can see why so the franchise earned so many new fans after this entry. As an former Uncharted fanboy, this game really pulled me in; I highly recommend it at any price.

Review is after completing the main story missions, all side missions, finding all collectibles, clearing the entire map and achieving 100% completion on single player mode. As a side note: never cared for multiplayer.
[hr][/hr]


[b]Story[/b]
My previous introduction to Tomb Raider was Tomb Raider Anniversary and Tomb Raider Underworld. I wasn’t able to finish those games for reasons I don't remember now, but this game was hard to put down in comparison. The opening sequence was shocking and impactful. It gave a strong sense of mystery and fear of the unknown. Lara’s survival story is well crafted and very satisfying to play through.


[b]Gameplay[/b]
Game progression was smooth and well paced. The game made me excited to explore every nook and cranny of the game to get at all the collectibles. The level design enabled the natural exploration of each level. The mechanic to rotate and admire the collectibles was a highlight. Lara is given a variety of weapons but the bow and arrow are the best as it encourages that stealth archer gameplay that I like. Excellent platforming sections. Camera adjusts near perfectly depending on how you move Lara across the platforming sections. Seamless cutscenes and quick time events that blend flawlessly to the gameplay. The game has a fitting crafting and upgrade system along with hunting and scavenging. I got the definitive edition that had really cool outfits for Lara. None of them were skimpy clothes which made the game playable with family traffic. Dynamic cover system makes combat smooth. Lara’s fail animations are brutal, I was compelled to keep her alive because I didn’t want to see Lara suffer like that. Tomb exploration was fantastic and was something I looked forward to. Poor Lara gets ragdolled a lot in the game. 


[b]Graphics[/b]
Exquisite details in the main characters and the same can be said about the backgrounds.


[b]Controls[/b]
Played using the Xbox controller attached to the PC. Gameplay was smooth and responsive. 


[b]Side Missions[/b]
There are a few side missions in the game and I completed all of them for the sake of seeing everything the game had to offer.



[b]Music/Soundtrack/Voice[/b]
Excellent voice acting from the voice actress for Lara. The supporting characters were also well voiced. Soundtrack was just as good and together they created an excellent tone in the game world.


[b]Performance[/b]
Experienced no crashes and the game ran smoothly on my PC (which is a mid-range PC). It did not cause undue heating of the CPU and GPU.

Combat was... fine.  It was on the easy side, but I didn't expect it to be CoD or anything.

Quick Time Events (QTE) are the bane of this game. There's mash E QTE and the game is not registering all the mashes if you are a fast masher, so you'll lose often. Heck, on the very last QTE, I failed like 20 times before I slowed down enough for it to register everything and I finaly won.  I would rather just NOT have QTE and watch the cutscenes play. It's either watch the scene and fail, or focus on button popups and fail to remember what went on in the cutscene.

Puzzles were either quick, or frustrating. But I suppose that actually on brand for Tomb Raider.

Story was decent, much more so than the rest of the game. In fact if felt like the game was a tag along to the story, like it was an after thought.

Skip the DLC, it's buggy. Or don't, but it's still a buck or two for a tomb, and in this game, those are one puzzle long and generally small.

Overall it's a 8 hour game with 12 to 20 hours of things to collect while playing. At this point I only recommend buying the game when it's on sale like I bought it. But if you hate finicky QTE  that you'll most likely get wrong simply because it doesn't register key presses right, then pass on this hard. It put me off enough that I just can't be bothered with buying the sequel games.",1694571547,1694572169,False,0,0,0.463121801614761353,0,True,False,False

Neither how she was designed to be a sex symbol nor how she came of as arrogant. Regardless of gameplay, I never really connected with the series.
This here is a lot better. Lara of course is still a super attractive woman but at least in the rebooted series she has human traits which makes it much easier for the player to connect with her. From a gameplay standpoint Crystal Dynamics obviously played the Uncharted series and took some inspiration here and there, which is okay, since Uncharted followed in the footsteps of the original Tomb Raider genre. Controls are fluid and responsive (playing with a controller).
Talking of Nathan Drake: Characters, writing, humour and music are still superiour in Uncharted, but Tomb Raiders gameplay and bombastic presentation are pretty much on the same level as the top (naughty) dog. For a 2013 game the graphics are simply fantastic (hair physics are amazing for that time) , performance capturing and camerwork very dynamic and the main voice actress does a great job as Lara. Other voice talent is consistently fine but their characters lack depth and so they don't really have a chance to shine. Lara is seriously missing memorably characters like Sully, Elena or Chloe from Uncharted.
Yeah, I made it pretty clear, that I prefer the former Playstation exclusive competitor but Tomb Raider is also a very good game, that I can recommend without any issues.
A final thought: I find it refreshing, that the tombs to be raided are this time in a Japanese setting. Another Aztec/Mayan adventure would have been very boring. So good decision of the developers to mix things up a little.",1693940103,1693940288,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I know what you might be thinking – ""But it's 2024! Shouldn't the game feel old?"" Nope, my friends. The controls are as smooth as butter on warm bread. I'm climbing cliffs, shooting arrows. It's like the game got a magic touch that keeps it awesome forever.

And the story? Oh my, it's still as captivating as ever. I'm hooked on Lara's journey like it's the best show on TV. The surprises in the story hit me like a fun surprise party, and the characters feel so real that I almost expect my cup of tea to start talking.

But that's not all! The atmosphere and exploration are just as exciting. I'm wandering through ancient ruins, solving puzzles that make my brain do flips, and sometimes accidentally falling off cliffs because I'm too busy admiring the scenery. Oops!

But you know what's even cooler in 2024? Sharing my epic fails and wins with the world. It's like a global gaming party where everyone's invited, and we're all here to have a great time together. So, if you thought Tomb Raider 2013 was old news, think again! It's like a favorite book that you can read over and over, and I'm giving a thumbs-up to this timeless gaming gem. 🎉🎮🏹",1693510136,1693510136,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is the first game of the new Tomb Raider Trilogy and in my opinion is the 2nd best one, great to play on the deck with superb graphics (played at 40fps, high settings).
Pretty simple and linear game with good story and simple puzzles, it tooked me 10h to complete the main story but theres much things to do (tombs, etc).
Recomend without any doubt in sale, great game on deck.

[b]Comment:[/b]
Finally a less clunky and more action oriented Tomb Raider game. While third person shooting is almost a cliche nowadays it really fits well here. So while many people who were fans of the previous games might get disappointed this new approach breathed life into the franchize. Yeah, the story gets a bit cheesy later on when you compare the fragile beginnings where everything can hurt Lara to the grandiose Rambo-like ending. But I still love it because at no point did I not have fun. While sometimes the game is QTE heavy I prefer it's linear approach. It gives focus on the fact that Lara is trying to survive, find her friends and escape the island. An open-world setting might have ruined that aspect. The tombs are okay but rather short and simple for a game called [u]Tomb[/u] Raider. Apart from tombs there are lots of collectibles which make your explore the scenery a bit more. These are not just for show as they help in your XP progress to level up your skills or to get salvage. The skill system helps give the feeling of Lara getting stronger as she progresses. There is also a weapon upgrade system where, if you collect enough salvage, you can improve them. That being said, the bow and arrow is the most satisfying for most of the game. You need four people to play a real multiplayer match. So nowadays it is really difficult to have one. Combined with DLC maps it is even tougher, so disable those if you wanna up your chances. Also expect to meet cheaters as there is no anti-cheat protection. The game has flaws, sure, but these all fade compared to the really fun and action-packed experience. Definitely worth checking out!

[b]P.S.:[/b] The GOTY Edition is not really needed as most of it is multiplayer stuff, six skins for singleplayer (Demoliton, Mountaineer, Sure-Shot, Hunter, Aviatrix, Guerilla) and the one extra tomb (Tomb of the Lost Adventurer) is still bugged.

[b]P.S.2:[/b] There is a [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/237450/Tomb_Raider_Japanese_Language_Pack/]Japanese Language Pack[/url] available but this DLC is negatively reviewed for a reason. It used to cost quite a lot of money for something that should be a normal part of the game. It was also unavailable in some regions. The language pack itself is nice, the voice over sounds good and complements the English version. Get it because now it's free and there is little reason not to. But to withhold a language pack behind a paywall was just plain dumb.

Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

Tomb Raider, the iconic franchise that has stood the test of time, returns with a gripping reimagining that revitalizes the essence of adventure and exploration. With its stunning visuals, immersive storytelling, and the transformation of a young Lara Croft into a legendary heroine, the game offers an exhilarating and unforgettable journey into the heart of adventure gaming.

The visual design of Tomb Raider is a visual masterpiece, immersing players in breathtaking landscapes that range from lush forests to treacherous tombs. The attention to detail in the environments, character models, and atmospheric effects creates an immersive and captivating experience.

At its core, Tomb Raider reintroduces players to a young and determined Lara Croft, taking her on a harrowing journey of survival on a mysterious island. The game's mechanics blend exploration, puzzle-solving, and intense action sequences to create a multifaceted gameplay experience.

The character development and emotional depth of the narrative are standout features, as players witness Lara's transformation from an inexperienced adventurer to a fearless heroine. The sense of empathy and connection with her struggles and growth adds a layer of engagement rarely seen in action-adventure games.

The gameplay seamlessly transitions between intense combat sequences, environmental puzzles, and exploration, creating a balanced and dynamic experience that keeps players engaged from start to finish.

The game's emphasis on exploration rewards players with hidden tombs, artifacts, and collectibles, encouraging them to delve deeper into the world and uncover its mysteries.

However, the game's more action-oriented approach might differ from the puzzle-heavy gameplay of the franchise's earlier iterations. Some players who loved the classic Tomb Raider puzzles might find this evolution a departure from the series' roots.

Certain moments in the game might be intense or violent, which could be unsettling for players sensitive to such content.

In conclusion, Tomb Raider is a triumphant revival of an iconic franchise, breathing new life into the adventures of Lara Croft. Its stunning visuals, immersive storytelling, and the evolution of a beloved character create an experience that's both nostalgic and fresh. While the shift towards a more action-driven gameplay might not resonate with purists of the original series, those who appreciate a blend of intense action, exploration, and character-driven storytelling will find themselves immersed in the heart-pounding world of Tomb Raider, where every step is a testament to the enduring legacy of adventure gaming.",1693031314,1693031314,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've never written a review for a game before but felt guilty not giving this game the props it deserves. The story isn't as deep as you'd hope it to be, but is still rewarding. The style of the game is one of a kind and an amazing entry into the trilogy, which seems to be the main emphasis of the game. The world(island?)-building is astounding and there are fascinating lore entries scattered throughout the game for you to find. The main cast are unfortunately very surface level, but do offer some fun dialogue and interactions throughout the course of the game.

Really fun and intuitive quick gameplay, as well as amazing cinematic production. it is really well optimized, it can even run on older machines with moderate graphics options, talking about graphics, the game looks amazing, especially on Ultra. The story is fantastic and really interesting as you explore the mysterious island you are deserted on. I was never bored playing this game and it was worth the purchase for sure.

Gameplay was very intuitive by being simple yet rich, and keeps on getting freshened up as you play all the way until the very end. Not only that but it wasn't overly complex nor very simple, but the perfect balance for quick and really fun rewarding gameplay.

This game was a cinematic experience. Some of the vital parts of the story were purely baffling with outstanding cinematography. and the rest of the game kept on giving stunning views and vistas all throughout.

This is a very well optimized game and it will probably run well even on old integrated graphics, but of course its best when its on ultra, and even on that it ran smooth as butter.
I did experience a couple of bugs during gameplay, but nothing gamebreaking or annoying.

The pure graphics were really great for the time this game was released in, maybe some of the best graphics at its time. The graphics did age fairly well, you can see the slight roughness compared to newer games, but mixed with the stunning cinematography, and the good lighting this game offered, it all bundled into an amazing viewing experience.

The story is pretty cool, fairly unique but with some cliches, but it was interesting with fairly good characters throughout. It is nothing groundbreaking, but also it is not a forgettable story. It was very interesting to unravel the mystery of the island you're on, while being mixed up in many other problems and conflicts.

Playing this game, especially if for the first time, you will not feel an inkling of boredom at any point. I urge you to explore every one of the semi-open locations you visit in-game as thoroughly as you can, and to loot as much as possible, it isn't boring this way, quite the opposite, because doing this will basically unlock much more quicker gameplay advancement, and you'l still have stuff to unlock by the end, so you wont even run out of things to advance in.

I heavily recommend buying this game if you have not played it already! it will be very well worth the purchase!

[hr][/hr]

While playing the game in whopping [i][b] 800 x 600 Resolution with very low Graphics [/b][/i], I won't complain much, but with my epic [i][b] Intel Pentium with Intel HD Graphics [/b][/i] or I could just say potato PC, this one runs well and still looks graphically awesome, like I'm playing in console.

It's a wonderful, astonishing, adrenaline rush of an action and stealth shooter. The cinematography is wonderful, the characters, enemies, and so on. Everything is what I can say a great game. An open-world experience, in 14 hours of my time, I manage to complete my first play-through with an overall 100% game completion (well, the weapons don't count on completion which is a good thing, trust me).

It's not a linear progression with just action, it's an open-world exploration action game. You're free to do anything as you wish, but for me, getting that 100% overall completion is enough. But if you're that dedicated, feel free to get achievements too.

Story wise, it's tense, mysterious, and astonishing. Attention up to the small details, reading documents are great to read since they can give more context to the characters, location, and story. 

Overall, a great game. But one important advice, Don't buy those Singleplayer DLCs especially those involving skills or weapon mods, those DLCs are just [b] official cheats [/b] makes you get things earlier, you can get all skills or even get everything needed and complete all without these mods.

First and foremost is the severe case of shaky camera syndrome it has.  Imagine watching a Jason Bourne film while in a Soviet-era Lada going 60+ km/h over moguls, and you'll get the idea.  It is so bad that it literally gives me motion sickness while trying to play it, so I had to limit myself to short stints just to get through it without throwing up.  I can't name another game that has done that to me, though other games let you turn it off.  Not so in TR.

Yes, you can hold down right-click (aim) to prevent the shaky cam, but this kills your movement speed.  It also won't work for anything more complicated than walking around, and as you can imagine, there's a lot of running/jumping/climbing/etc. in this game.

My second, and only other major gripe, is the presence of QTEs.  It's not just one or two of them, either, as they're thrown in your face at basically any opportunity the game can.  If this were the only major problem, I might recommend it, but combined with aforementioned camera issues, there's just no way.

It's a shame, really.  The rest of the game is pretty good, but the omnipresent camera shake is a constant reminder of how one little detail can totally ruin the entire experience.

I came across a bunch of glitches throughout the game, with the best being minor problems such as an NPC being stuck dangling from a ledge in trying to jump off, and the worst being the camera that follows the player completely spinning out, only fixable via restarting everything. That last one made the game unplayable whenever it occurred, which was several times in my play-through. I get the game was made in 2013, but I tend to expect an 'overwhelmingly positive' game to be pretty bulletproof.
In terms of gameplay, the starting tutorial was pretty poor, with long cutscenes and minor gameplay consisting of ""mash f"", ""mash left and right"", and ""hold e"". Not very fun. Afterwards, it got better, though having to crank things by mashing one button still was a bit odd to me, not sure if it's the norm in 3d games. I also didn't really enjoy the wall climbing with the pick, even after getting the hang of it (pun intended). Just personal preference, not really anything significant, just something to add to the pile. 

I also expected more adventure in the game, like with a bit more choice in where to go. It was mostly just a first-person-shooter, with the secret tombs being part adventure, part puzzle.

the 2013 entry within the tomb raider lineage heralded the advent of phenomenal trilogy that would unfold in its wake. this installment steers it’s narrative compass towards uncharted territories. this time around, the persona of lara croft is of a youthful and decidedly novice in contrast to the fearless and independent portrayal that is usually seen. you experience lara’s mixed emotions and the tension built through out the game as you progress further. the game also follows a much darker and gory tone in certain areas suffusing the surroundings with a unconventional colour palette bouncing around the shades of gray.

In 2013, a LOT of what was popular is just not my taste, and thankfully a lot of it is going away in games - for example, Quick Time Events. 

So with that, I would recommend this game to someone who really likes the style of bullet sponge wonky combat, QTEs, illogical climbing and grabbing and jumping, and overall kinda poor gameplay. 

If you like it, or at least, can tolerate it, the rest of the game, of which there is a bit, is rewarding. The island is fun to explore, when everything isn't exploding, and I do mean everything - ""watch out for that exploding sand, look out, an exploding mountain that isn't a volcano,  for some reason."" 

My issue with the game is that what it offers, that I do enjoy, it offers very little of. Exploration, gathering, crafting, survival - all well executed but barely implemented. 

The things I don't like, terrible combat, and I can't emphasize that enough, and poor gameplay with overloaded QTEs, well, that's about 60-70% of the game itself. 

So with that, I got the game for $3, and would say it was easily worth it, because the high points were really high, albeit not many. But enough to get me through the game. 

I've heard the sequel is better, and I can see how a great sequel could come out of this, if they expand on the exploration, gathering, crafting, etc... and fix the ridiculously, comically terrible combat. 

Question to the devs, how did 47,000,000 soldiers all end up on one small island, and even more mind-boggling, how did they all end up with the same voice? No joke, every enemy you fight has the same ""batman thug"" voice, and they maybe say 3 things ""where is she?"" ""there she is"" ""get her!"". So get ready for hours of hearing one man's voice say that 47,000,000 times, as you shoot them 5 times in the face with a shotgun, only for them to stumble a little then kill you with an arrow.

This wows with stunning visuals, especially considering the release year. The game's environments, ranging from lush forests to intricate tombs, were meticulously designed and featured impressive attention to detail. Character models, especially Lara, were remarkably lifelike, showcasing expressions and emotions that enhanced immersion. The lighting and particle effects added to the realism, making exploration of the island a captivating experience.

Gameplay:
The gameplay marks a significant departure from the series' previous entries. It blends exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving seamlessly, reflecting Lara's transformation from an inexperienced survivor to a resourceful adventurer. The addition of RPG elements, such as skill upgrades and crafting, allows to tailoring the experience to different playstyles. The island setting provided an open-world feel, encouraging exploration and discovery beyond the main story.  Unfortunately the game's reliance on quick-time events (QTEs) during key moments occasionally disrupted immersion. 

Story:
The narrative focused on a young Lara Croft stranded on a mysterious island after a shipwreck. The story's progression was engaging, chronicling Lara's evolution from a vulnerable survivor to a capable heroine. The emotional depth and character development made Lara a relatable protagonist. The island's secrets, steeped in history and mythology, intertwined well with the overarching plot, creating a sense of intrigue and urgency.  However the occasional dissonance between Lara's character development and her body count, as she transitioned from a survivor to a combat-savvy adventurer is jarring. 

Sound:
The audio design played a crucial role in the game's immersive atmosphere. The ambient sounds of the island, along with the orchestral score, heightened tension during intense moments and underscored emotional scenes. Voice acting, particularly Camilla Luddington's portrayal of Lara, was top-notch, delivering authenticity and relatability to the characters.

Presentation:
Tomb Raider's presentation excelled at immersing players in its world. The UI was intuitive, providing easy access to inventory management and objectives without feeling intrusive. Cutscenes seamlessly transitioned into gameplay, maintaining the flow of the story. The game's pacing struck a balance between action-packed sequences and quiet moments of introspection.

Rating
The 2013 Tomb Raider game successfully reinvigorated the franchise with its captivating graphics, dynamic gameplay, engaging story, immersive sound design, and polished presentation. Despite some minor flaws, it managed to revitalize the iconic character of Lara Croft while delivering a satisfying modern gaming experience. This reboot set the stage for Lara's continued adventures and demonstrated the potential for growth within the franchise.  I would rate this 9/10.

[b] Overall [/b] : 9/10

Tomb raider is a very good reboot of the Lara Croft saga, by focusing on the birth of the adventuress and how she became the world famous tomb raider.

A definitive must-have for any fan of adventure game, with a rich story and strong characters! 

[b] Gameplay : 9/10 [/b]

The game has a rich mix between exploration, puzzles solving and combat phases. Very nice animations overall, and the gunplay is very satisfying for such a genre. Kudos to the devs!

[b] Graphics: 8/10 [/b]

I discovered the game only now (2021) but considering that it's actually from 2013, I must say I am impressed. The engine performs very well, and deliver some very nice environments and effects. Lighting, FX, textures are all excellent for me. And it scales quite well to 4K.

[b] Story : 9/10 [/b]

I actually appreciated the fact that the reboot tried to move away from the bimbo akimbo style, and actually tries to shape the story of how Lara became who she is. You will actually see her grow through the events and challenges, and the overall story is very well delivered with little to no down-time. Bravo!

[b] Achievement hunting : 4/10 [/b]

For the hunters out there, this one will be troublesome due to the online ones. Very hard to get people online unless you get a group of hunters. And 2 will require hours of grinding.

Since I started using Steam, I've always enjoyed creating my own reviews for games that I truly liked. I must admit, I'm not the best at providing detailed reviews, and when it comes to Tomb Raider, I find it a bit challenging to put my thoughts into words. However, I feel compelled to share my thoughts on this amazing game.

As someone who never had the opportunity to experience the old Tomb Raider series in its prime, I wanted to start with the second-generation games but never got around to it. From what I know, the old Tomb Raider games focused heavily on puzzles while also delivering a captivating story. I have a fondness for puzzles, so I was expecting to encounter some challenging ones in the game. However, it was quite the opposite. While there are optional tombs to discover by exploring the map, the puzzles in Tomb Raider are not as intricate as one might expect from a Tomb Raider game. This aspect was a little disappointing, although it's certainly not something that detracts from the overall enjoyment of the game.

Despite being released in 2013, Tomb Raider still boasts impressive graphics, stunning visuals, and a detailed atmosphere. Everything about the game is visually gorgeous.

The story kicks off with the beautiful archaeologist, Lara Croft, aboard a ship called Endurance, belonging to Roth, an old friend of the Croft family. They embark on an adventure to find the mythical Kingdom of Yamatai in a place known as the Dragon's Triangle. Despite warnings from the chief archaeologist, Lara convinces the crew to take the risk. As most of you may know, an adventure with Lara Croft can never begin like that of a normal human being.

There are a few gameplay aspects I wish were more prominent, such as a survival mechanic. While there are animals to hunt, it serves little purpose beyond needing to eat something at the beginning of the game. The hunger mechanic is virtually non-existent. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it would have been pointless to introduce a mechanic without fully utilizing it. That being said, the gameplay itself is satisfying. You can choose to be stealthy and complete objectives without being detected, or you can dive headfirst into the action.

I've never been a fan of searching an entire area to find collectibles without any hints. In Tomb Raider, you can find treasure maps that reveal the locations of treasures you need to collect. This is a great option for players who don't want to painstakingly search every nook and cranny. Even if you're not a fan of collecting, I would still recommend collecting journals if you want to learn more about side characters and their stories.

Tomb Raider 2013 is your typical ""cinematic"" AAA experience - linear gameplay, B-movie-level writing, many many explosions, and... a surprising lack of tomb raiding.

Most of the ""ancient dangers"" are wooden structures so old that they fall apart the moment Lara touches them, and ""tombs"" are reduced to little side rooms with a physics puzzle inside. Your enemies will be your fellow humans for a whopping [spoiler]95[/spoiler]% of the game (not counting wolves, who appear about [spoiler]4[/spoiler] times total).

The story focuses more on Lara herself... in a 'torture porn' kind of way. Lara is put through a lot of abuse to show us how much she ""grows"" as a result, but the facepalm-worthy writing makes this hard to take seriously.

As a whole, the game is just competent enough to be entertaining but does not excel or innovate in any way. If you buy it on sale - you're basically paying the price of a burger for a burger-level enjoyment.

Years gone by, after all the Tomb Raider franchises I've played from the good to the bad ones of those years, thought I was done with Lara. 
Then this one released and I tried this remake. Instantly love it! Hook, line and sinker! 
She is the best treasure hunter ever! On par with Indiana Jones but not even same with Nathan Drake, don't get me wrong. I love Uncharted as well but Lara Croft is still winner by default, the O.G. by all of the OGs!

Sure this one feels more action than exploring, but still the best among many Tomb Raider series so far. And I love the plot as well.

I greatly enjoyed TR. It's got a driving story and lots of extras if you enjoy achievements or side challenges. I finished the story around 20 hours, but it could be finished sooner in a speed run. I like to explore and upgrade as I go.

I enjoyed the challenges and achievements, but some of them seemed glitched, so that was annoying. Once I looked up some community help, I was able to complete them.

This game is very combat-oriented and less focused on the actual ""tomb raider""/puzzle aspect of Lara's story and character, with her even saying ""I hate tombs"". Ironic. Keep in mind that this is supposed to be her origin story, so it focuses more on her drive to survive. She still takes interest in the artifacts and the decoration of the tombs, so that's nice that her archaeology degree isn't negligible. However, I saw someone's review that it's less ""Tomb Raider"" style than the older games and far more geared towards combat. I'd agree that this game doesn't quite fit the franchise perfectly.

I would have liked to see more puzzles, but I got my fun out of the game :)

The biggest issue I had was motion sickness. It was horrible until I adjusted some graphic settings. There was no specific ""motion sickness"" setting though, so I had to play around and look for community solutions to the common problem.

The story is overall simple and straightforward, great for anyone who doesn't like super complicated stories.
The gameplay is a third person cover shooter mixed with platforming.
There are collectibles and challenges which are fairly easy to find and complete (I had to look up 1 or 2 of them)
Character upgrades are in the form of Skills and Weapon upgrades. You gain XP for skills and acquire scrap for Weapon upgrades, some of which you can only get through story progression.
You can complete anything you miss after the main story if that's your thing.

The stealth sections are really good. The controls are generally great. The combat feels pretty good and has some surprising nuance with cover and counter mechanics.

The bad parts - my god this story is dog. It is patchy, jumps around, characters are terrible and basically teleport in and out for no reason. The combat is overdone and tedious. There are too few enemy types. While the guns feel good, combat isn't interesting enough to carry the game. The level design is very inconsistent and ranges from excellent to total garbage - leaning bad. Platforming is fun in places, but the same tropes are thrown at you time and time again.

At the begging of the game you feel really unsafe but as the game progresses you unlock very useful skills and feel really powerful but not OP so great balance there. The multiple weapons and secondary modes of each provide good flexibility and allow for passing the same sections of the games with different approaches. Each area of the game feels unique and interesting.

Collecting stuff its generally a safe addition to extend the game length however in some areas asking the player to find 15 chips might become super boring and tedious wish they find other way to extend game playtime as exploration is encourage enough by providing ammo, xp and salvage.

puzzles are creative and the game difficulty seem pretty fair at normal and hard levels, pass the game on both. challenges are often a good distraction when you need to pause the story for a bit or just do something else.

The big downside for me was the enemies, you basically keep fitting the same type enemies over and over again just with a different skin.",1689219496,1689219496,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have to please old fans while also bringing in a new audience, a quite daunting task, but one that Crystal Dynamics have pulled off. As a new player to the franchise, Tomb Raider has gotten me quite interested in the history and future of Lara Croft, and I hope this game will have the same affect on you,

But why? 

For me Tomb Raider gave me the right amount of action and exploration as well as a mechanic I wish more games would include, optional puzzles. Combat provides a nice and well paced break from the endless amount of exploring this game has to offer, trying to hunt for a difficult to find collectable only to have my mind refreshed with a brief but enjoyable combat encounter gave me the will to power through and find that one collectable.

Story wise, I have no real complaints, it's well paced, well told and quite interesting, especially to someone like me; I thought that Tomb Raider was going to be very grounded, but to my surprise the included many fantasy elements, most of which I enjoyed.

Overall, this game is 100% worth it on sale for anyone, and if you like action-adventures, I would also say it's worth the full 20$.",1689170888,1689170888,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm an Uncharted kid, I never played the og Tomb Raiders nor did I ever sought them out purely because I thought Uncharted had better graphics at the time... I was a dumb kid. Anyway, I still am not gonna play the og Tomb Raider games as it just does not look appealing to me in the slightest, so I decided to get this 2013 remake/ reboot and I gotta say it is a solid re-imagining of the series and as an Uncharted fan, this all felt pretty familiar. All the gameplay beats were pretty second nature to me excluding the rpg elements like the upgrading of weapons.

Story-wise it's pretty decent but doesn't really stick with you for long although it's still does a pretty good job making the player curious as to what the heck is happening on the island. Characters are... well, let's just say objectively with absolutely no bias... Uncharted had better characters and everyone except Lara kinda sucks. I don't even remember most of their names are save for Roth and Reyes which really dampens the experience because most of Lara's crew does not make it to the end and I really wanted to care... but I just don't.

As for gameplay, yeah if you played Uncharted you'll feel right at home! Not a lot to say here

In conclusion, it's not a perfect game but a perfect way to revive the franchise. I enjoyed my time with it and am giving this game a 7/10

It's a 2013 game, so you're getting 2013 jank. The platforming is broken half the time, animations can be a bit stiff, and the story is pretty simple.

The camera sway is so bad, I had to stop playing several times. There is no way to disable it. I am sorry.

Lara suffers from terminal ""I forgot I have a gun"" syndrome, where 90% of her in-game problems would be solved if she would just use one of her several guns to kill her enemies instead of using her bow.

The story DOES involve the supernatural, so just keep that in mind.

Mac users: this game does okay with performance. I have an M1 Pro 14"" and it could handle the higher -- not highest -- graphics well. Definitely keep your Mac charging though, pretty much any game will devour the battery. It works with controllers (Xbox One Elite). The only gripe I do have is online.

The puzzles, traversing/platforming and combat is fun but became a bit repetitive at times (maybe because puzzle/platforming games aren't my go to). For a game made in 2013 the graphics/visuals of the world hold up very well. The sound design/effects are nicely done and the overall story itself was enjoyable, but I personally wasn't enthralled during my playthrough and likely wouldn't play it again. The combat and upgrading your 4 main weapons was good fun, but was refreshing was the gore. I feel more and more games are distancing themselves from it, but Tomb Raider embraces it, especially with the melee kills, cinematics and especially Lara's own death cut scenes which can be pretty brutal at times. I couldn't find a Multiplayer game, so reviewing that is out of the question. Bug wise I faced a few issues with the aspect ratio being slightly zoomed in as well as random crashes which were annoying at times. The collectibles in this game were actually decent but still felt like a chore to complete all of them including the challenges. Overall this game was a great pickup for the few bucks I paid for it, and I recommend it to anyone who has or hasn't played Tomb Raider games - 7.5/10",1638788078,1688899732,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Earlier this year, the first game in the Tomb Raider Reboot trilogy had it's 10th anniversary (happy late birthday Tomb Raider 2013!), and incidentally it was the year I randomly decided to give it a go!
 
I will say that I haven't played the original games, so I won't weigh in on how it compares to the originals, but in my honest opinion? This game bloody rules! The graphics are decent, considering it's age, and bizarrely managed to chug my frames from time to time (my rig isn't very up to date in all fairness, and I was running on maxed settings) but oh lord this game shines on game-play. 
 
I loved the story, with the Lost City of Yamatai being the main focus of the story (somewhat like Japan's version of Atlantis) with a few vicious antagonists and some absolutely killer gameplay! It was high octane, massively entertaining and downright frightening at times. My one complaint is the gunplay can be very repetitive however, that's to be expected with only 4 weapons regardless of upgradability. The game fully utilised many environments to spice up the gameplay in new and interesting ways, and it really went apeshit at the end, it was incredible!
 
The story was just the right amount of mystery to have the player figure it out before our protagonist as a nice lil' ego boost, but it doesn't make you wanna play any less after figuring out where it's going. Most of the characters had decent motivations, but some bugged me. Reyes is openly untrusting and sceptical of Lara's capabilities for a good portion of the game, and following an event which could of lead to some deserved feeling character development, tense dialogue, and allowing some depth to be added character who's been as shallow as the rest of the side cast. Like seriously, Jonah makes a joke about his hunger because he has a bit of a belly, Reyes has a daughter and Alex likes Lara. That's the extent of them. Well there's Kroft, but even he is sorta flawed explanation on why Lara is such a Mary Sue.

Lara Croft is like, ""Who needs delicate excavation tools when you can have dual pistols and a sassy attitude?""

She's a master at defying physics—swinging from ropes, surviving insane jumps, and landing without a scratch. I half expect her to whip out a cape and start flying around ancient ruins, all while maintaining perfectly styled hair.

But let's not forget her approach to historical preservation: ""Blow up the tomb, grab the loot, and leave destruction in your fabulous wake!"" It's like she's on a personal mission to rewrite history, one explosion at a time.

And can we talk about her wardrobe? Lara must have a closet full of tank tops and shorts, because who needs practicality when you can raid tombs looking like a runway model? Forget about protective gear; her fashion choices scream, ""I'm here to slay, both archaeologically and in style!""

In the end, Tomb Raider is the ultimate guilty pleasure. It's a game that throws realism out the window, embraces over-the-top action, and gives us a heroine who defies all odds, including the laws of nature. So buckle up, grab your virtual weapons, and get ready for a wild ride that will make you question everything you thought you knew about archaeology and just how many times one person can cheat death.

Advancing technology has evolved videogame storytelling from the jolly and fantastical escapades of Spyro and Croc, to the gripping and realistic storylines to Joel (TLOU) and Marcus Fenix (GoW). This leaves cross-generational protagonists to often fall by the wayside, forced to evolve (often unsuccessfully) or fade into obscurity. 

As we enter Tomb Raider (2013), and the changing perceptions of what video game characters can be, it’s worth considering pop culture as a whole too. The ‘grim-dark’ and vulnerable era of DC comics was in full effect, fresh of the influence of The Dark Knight. We had not just the sequel The Dark Knight Rises, but also in the same year of Tomb Raider the pessimistic Man of Steel.

The reinvention of Lara Croft necessitated a similar approach to meet changing mainstream tastes. Ignoring all marketing materials, the Tomb Raider name perhaps spurs on ideas of slow methodical climbing among magically infused ruins. However, Tomb Raider (2013) is all about the consequences and pain of survival. Lara, while initially hesitant at killing, is quickly and violently culling armies of mercenaries in some of the most ruthless ways possible. Pickaxes to the face, shotgun blasts at point range, and even dousing enemies in petrol and setting them on fire. 

While the transition is a bit sudden, this reinvention thrives on just how bloody fun it is. The gunplay is fast, fluid and punctuated by highly destructible environments. Lara also throws her weaponry about with genuine weight, and most enemies die from a single headshot even on hard. It’s gory and brutal, but also requires precision and patience – especially when using the incredibly fun bow and arrow.

Platforming is tight, rhythmic and intuitive and becomes increasingly thrilling as your equipment gets upgraded. There are jaw-dropping set pieces as Lara climbs up ropes some 200m in the air to traverse nearby towers, but my favorite moments are jumping over precarious drops only to smash your pickaxe into a cliff face and begin slowly pulling yourself up. Lara’s strength feels beyond human most of the time, but it’s for the benefit of the gameplay. I can feel the number of hours Crystal Dynamics animators put into this work, and can only imagine the nights spent perfecting Lara’s movement to feel “just” right.

What makes Tomb Raider so fantastic is now just the combat and platforming in isolation, but how incredibly well-paced the whole thing is. Every time I thought I could do with some more shooting, there was a 20-minute firefight just around the corner. Whenever I felt I needed a break to take in the landscape, there was a tomb to explore or a set piece to travel across. There’s absolutely no tedium in this game, and the end product is an incredibly lean and well edited adventure that might only take around 13 hours to complete, or near 18 to 100%. By the game’s final mission, I was quickly adding the sequel to my Steam cart.

Tomb Raider (2013) is an expertly handed reboot that brings Lara to the modern age. The gameplay is so well-polished, so tightly tuned that it’s an absolute joy to play start to finish. For that, I can only give it the highest praise.",1688310970,1688310970,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

A rarity among the trophy hall of bad video games, Tomb Raider's 2013 reboot is bad within its own right, and bad within the scope of competitors and predecessors in a wide range of aspects. Despite having award-winning inspirations in the form of Uncharted and Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider manages to take the worst elements of both (linear gameplay and boring climbing sequences lovingly garnished with the most abysmal camera of any game ever made), package them up neatly among a myriad of other game-destroying failures (a tragedy of a progression system, hilariously bad dialogue, illogical writing, and an impressive lack of tomb raiding), and throw the whole box of goodies open-side-first over a cliff (only to grab a hanging plank of wood at the last moment with QTE, of course). The sole bright spot - a very interesting underlying story. Wasted, shat upon, dumpstered by astronomically absurd character decision making (you're right, I think we should split up [ON AT LEAST FOUR OCCASIONS]) and an ending that reveals itself a mere quarter into the story, but only acknowledged by the protagonist at the last second after having traipsed halfway around the island chasing the last brain cell she was granted by birth. The combat is designed excitingly poorly - I genuinely found myself pleasantly amused by how stupid it is that the handgun, being the only accurate weapon in the game, outclassed every single damage source (point blank shotgun, fully automatic AK) with no question till the very end. And also how a muzzle brake raises said damage, hm. Tomb Raider is a lifeless, featureless, monstrous corpse, and I am never, ever delving back into this stinking crypt ever again.",1687639743,1687639743,False,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

The story is not compelling at all in my opinion. You're immediately thrust into an intense shipwreck cutscene as the opener with absolutely no context, which is a terrible start because it makes it hard to care about the plot or any of the characters. All the characters are very boring and have no personality, sadly including Lara. Coming from someone who loves a strong female protagonist, I hate how Lara is portrayed. She comes across as a robotic being who magically continues through every hardship, but it doesn't feel genuine at all because there is absolutely no acknowledgement of her persistence or overcoming any struggle. All her actions are purely to drive the poorly done story with no emotion or logic. No puzzle solving feels rewarding, you solve a puzzle and something immediately goes wrong and you tumble into another problem, which becomes repetitive and cliche. It's odd how Lara does such amazing feats in the game, but you feel absolutely no strength at all from her. Rather than her successes coming from her strength or resilience or smarts or something of the sort, everything just seems to be pure luck which doesn't make Lara seem like a likeable or strong character and just feels like the cliche shallow female character in media. Another cliche - too many damn explosions. Feels like a bad action movie. The story and how it's presented and all the characters are something I strongly dislike about the game. The story of the island is promising but presented poorly and has lots of boring pieces scattered throughout too. The gameplay isn't redeeming either, I wouldn't say it's particularly fun or satisfying, it feels painfully average. A lot of the climbing mechanics are also very infuriating, a lot of the ""parkour"" is finicky, and if you're the tiniest bit off from the designated landing spot (despite taking the correct route) or or pressing a button a moment too early or late you fall to your death and have to do it again.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 brown sugar
4. 1/2 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples -peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double crust pie
Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F ( 220 degrees C )
2. Combine butter , white sugar ,brown sugar, water , cinnamon and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside
3- Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices
4. Roll out top crust into 10 inch circle. Cut into 8 ( 1-inch ) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie,coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C ) and bake until the crust is golden brown , the caramel on the top is set and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I only had two issues whilst playing this, for example, some HUD elements were cut off in the corners of the screen. Also I had one glitch where the cliff side bunker door was glitched half open meaning I couldn't continue the story but by using grenades at the floor and rolling into the door I managed to bypass it.

Cons: Forced third-person shooting sections
The game feels like two games, one a survival stealth platformer with your primary weapon as the bow. This part is absolutely excellent. Then the game will grind to a halt and force you to fight waves and waves of enemies with a shotgun and assault rifle which isn't nearly as fun. You get perks to help you in combat, but none of those perks actually increase your health, so even in the endgame you can only take 2 or so hits from enemy gunfire. It's realistic of course considering Lara is going around the whole game in a tank top, and fits the parts of the game where you need to stealthily take out enemies from afar. But the forced shooting sections just feel tacked on and unnecessarily frustrating. 
Absolutely everything else about the game is top-notch, though.",1686979335,1686979335,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Could you push past your physical boundaries and even kill to save you and your loved ones? 

The look of the game has aged gracefully, say for some hair, fire, and blood effects. The soundtrack composed by Jason Graves is excellent; it is not only bombastic but excels in quieter and subtle moments–sometimes just the light tapping of drums or a few choice musical notes perfectly timed upon accomplishing a goal. Just a few notes from the game’s theme–”A Survivor Is Born”–are enough for it to bounce around my head for days afterwards.

The adventure is set in the forgotten civilization of Yamatai (a purported civilization of actual ancient Japan), a mysterious and eerie–yet also beautiful–island that Lara and her companions become marooned on. Danger creeps up on the castaways as the island conceals ancient ruins, remains of past explorers, forgotten WWII facilities, and a violent cult called the Solarii. This setting capped off with the scavenger-like constructs of the Solarii provide many action set pieces for the player to explore and fight through. 

An aspect of worldbuilding that stood out on this playthrough are the conversations between the Solarii members. Upon eavesdropping, one gets the sense that the members are conflicted: some believe the fantastical elements preached to them while others openly mock it. There are some colorful exchanges too. The standouts are a cultist begging another for a book to finish his series (he retorts there is no store on the island), and the other being a cultist imploring for help to find his pet rat.  

With all this praise in mind, the game's greatest achievements are its cinematic qualities and characterization. All the supporting protagonists are memorable, each with their own chance to shine. (And that's without reading their personal journals hidden throughout the game, which only further their motivations.) Lara’s journey is of course at the center of the story, and it keeps the player invested while propelling the story forward. Her metamorphosis from a naive girl to survivor is accomplished quite naturally (with just the right amount of badass moments that feel earned and not forced). She cannot save everyone. 

Oddly enough, perhaps the most memorable part of the game to me is a quick, simple cutscene showing Lara returning to the wreck of her ship, the Endurance, after surviving on the island for some time. After enduring so much trauma and grief, for a brief second, she stares into the mirror of her old ship quarters. Does she recognize the face staring back at her?

I played this game through to the end, it has great gameplay, but I would highly recommend against it. It gets progressively worse as you go through the game, and reveals is darker influences more and more, right down to the very end. It has excessive, and I mean EXCESSIVE gore, including large quantities of genital mutilation, severed limbs and body parts, cannibalism, rooms filled with mutilated corpses, and even a scene of falling into blood of many dead men and having to swim through the blood. Many images of human sacrifice with graphic depictions, including people strung up in a crucified fashion if not directly crucified. The story goes from trying to discover a lost civilization, to the worship of an actual false goddess of the shinto religion, known as Amaterasu, the sun goddess in Japanese mythology, and it reveals this only in the concept art after completing the game, as well as that the shrines and altars were dedicated to her. She's given the name Himiko in the game, who was a shaman queen who ruled by means of magic and sorcery according to ancient Chinese texts, and she sent slaves as gifts to the emperor of China. She also had 1000 men and woman buried alive with her as a part of her funerary services. Oh and in the game she ruled oni, who are demons in Japanese mythology, and at the very end, ""SPOILER ALERT"" she my means of sorcery has kept on possessing the bodies of her priestesses and the final battle in the game is taking place while she tries to demonically possess one of the party members.

This 2013 release takes players on a thrilling journey as they witness Lara's transformation from a vulnerable survivor to a resilient and determined adventurer. With its cinematic presentation, intense gameplay, and a compelling narrative, Tomb Raider redefines the franchise for a new generation of gamers.

The game follows a young and inexperienced Lara Croft as she finds herself stranded on a mysterious island after a shipwreck. Struggling to survive, she must navigate treacherous environments, unravel ancient mysteries, and confront a ruthless cult that controls the island. The narrative explores Lara's resilience, growth, and inner strength as she battles not only the physical dangers but also her own fears and doubts. The story is well-paced, filled with suspenseful moments, and keeps players engaged throughout the gripping adventure.

Tomb Raider combines intense action sequences, exploration, and puzzle-solving elements, creating a satisfying gameplay experience. As Lara, players must traverse diverse environments, ranging from lush forests to crumbling ruins, while engaging in thrilling platforming, stealth, and combat encounters. The game strikes a balance between challenging encounters and more relaxed exploration, ensuring a varied and engaging gameplay loop.

The combat mechanics in Tomb Raider are polished and satisfying, with a wide variety of weapons and tools at Lara's disposal. From archery to close-quarter combat, players have multiple options to approach encounters based on their playstyle. The game also introduces a skill system that allows players to customize Lara's abilities, enhancing her combat prowess and survival instincts as the adventure progresses.

Tomb Raider boasts stunning visuals and a cinematic presentation that immerses players in its world. The environments are beautifully rendered, with attention to detail in the atmospheric lighting, weather effects, and environmental design. Lara herself is meticulously crafted, with realistic animations and expressions that add depth to her character. The game's set pieces and action sequences are visually spectacular, heightening the excitement and adrenaline of the gameplay.

One of the standout aspects of Tomb Raider is the character development of Lara Croft. As players guide her through the harrowing journey, they witness her transformation from a vulnerable and uncertain young woman to a resilient and determined adventurer. The voice acting and motion capture work bring Lara's emotions and growth to life, making her a relatable and captivating protagonist.

While Tomb Raider received critical acclaim and is widely regarded as a fantastic game, like any other title, it has its share of criticisms and flaws. The game occasionally suffers from pacing problems, with a few sections feeling repetitive or drawn-out, which can disrupt the overall flow of the experience. Some players felt that the game's combat encounters were relatively easy, especially on lower difficulty settings. The AI of enemies was considered simplistic, diminishing the level of challenge and tactical depth.

Despite being an adventure game, Tomb Raider received criticism for not offering as much exploration freedom as previous titles in the franchise. Some players found the world to be too linear and confined, reducing the sense of open exploration. The puzzle-solving elements in the game were often considered too straightforward and lacking in complexity. The puzzles could have been more challenging and thought-provoking, providing a deeper sense of satisfaction upon completion.

While Lara Croft's transformation into a strong and capable adventurer is a central theme of the game, some players felt that certain aspects of her character development were rushed or underdeveloped. Some moments and relationships could have been given more time and depth. The supporting cast of characters in the game had potential for more development, but many were underutilized and lacked significant depth. Expanding on their backstories and motivations could have added more emotional weight to the narrative.

Despite these flaws, Tomb Raider still received widespread praise for its engaging story, stunning visuals, and refined gameplay mechanics. Tomb Raider successfully reinvents a beloved gaming icon, delivering a thrilling and emotionally charged adventure. With its cinematic presentation, intense gameplay, and a compelling narrative, the game captures the essence of Lara Croft's origins while introducing fresh elements to the franchise. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to the series, Tomb Raider offers an immersive and unforgettable experience that will leave you eagerly anticipating Lara's future adventures.

nothing great but I do like the bow n arrow in this game
cant get myself to replay it or get all the collectables
cutscenes are cliche and somewhat cringy

If u like me and got this cause of the 'unspecified content' then I recommend to just stick with that instead of getting this for that.

I can say maybe this game is good for new comers to gaming but that's it. Everything needs simple controls and basically pacing of movement is done for u. no auto aim so they will have to learn to aim on their own. Game ain't gonna baby feed u if u cant aim.

This part released in 2013 doesn't have auto-aim assist or HRD graphics. I recorded it @60FPS 4K with 60HZ and 36mbps bitrate. The hard combat level is the highest difficulty level of this game. Fights are strategic and one or two ways to pass some important checkpoints. Few rules I might tell you to enjoy the game bit more. When you RAID an enemy gathering or AMBUSH you must keep shooting, otherwise, no one will take cover you won’t be able to stand for a second. This shooting needs to be accurate mostly, enemies won't die without clear headshots. In an ambush of the enemy, you need to have an idea who is shooting after whom, their distance, your covers, and changing covers quickly to distract their aims. They do usually do the same. It is expected that some shots will not touch you or kill you while they are fixing aim at you. Don’t be so aggressive when the number of enemies is high, they keep coming in some stronghold locations and start acting randomly to make the player angry. Sometimes you must back off to get to cover when too many shooters aiming at you in one place. This game is really difficult to play in a cool head specifically at a hard difficulty level.



You'll get fire in the Bow to shoot arrows around the quarter of the game, and a grenade launcher around the middle of the game. You must play silent mode in some places. The use of ammo is critical for this game. Arrow is a bit easy to aim best for long distances, a shotgun for short distances very difficult to aim for moving opponents, the rifle is the best like the revolver but they kill ammo very quickly. Three main tricks; moving your body to adjust your aim sometimes, dodging with button B to kill a very close attack, and rolling out and rolling in keeping your aim in control.

Its a good start to the Tomb Raider reboot series, with the following games being awesome as well.

Even though the following games have improved the ""Tomb Raider Style"" in many different ways, this game is still the most focused on the shooter aspect due to numerous battle sequences and plenty of action, which I liked very much as a person that loves playing shooter games.
Additionally, this game (at least in my opinion) has the best weapon upgrade and crafting system of the series, supporting this side of the game even more.
But also the parkour and puzzle sections have a lot to offer and you definitely get your money's worth in these areas.
Also, in terms of story, this episode of the reboot series is the most solid out of all 3 games. 

So while I think that the other 2 games are better in some aspects, the first part is the best overall and therefore absolutely recommended.

I kept wanting to keep going, and when I finally managed to pull myself away to sleep, or eat, I couldn't wait to pick it up again. Tomb Raider has a few cheesy lines in it, but for the most part the visuals were good, the acting was good, the story was solid, and it paced itself in a way that you wanted to progress the story, but didn't feel so rushed that you couldn't stop and collect things. I 100% the game my first time and it felt rewarding. If you pay attention to your finds you will figure out what is happening before Lara does. In fact, if there is one complaint I have about the story, it is that Lara doesn't put 2+2 together for a little longer than it should have taken her. The game puzzles pose unique challenges, and are not repetitive. Exploring incentivizes strategy, and when things inevitably go wrong, you can improvise. There are multiple ways to play out any area: stealth, guns blazing, or manipulating explosive barrels. There are many different finishers that make you want to try out the different weapons. The biggest issue I had with the game play was that it was too easy, even on hard. The most frustrating part of it all was playing on a Steam Deck, which runs the game great, but is a controller, and aiming with a controller is tough when you have dozens of enemies swarming you, ducking in and out of cover. I mostly died to miss shots due to that. I recommend starting the game on hard. There were a few glitches that required restarting the game towards the latter half, but it was mostly a solid experience.

First off, I want to praise the presentation values in this game. Good visuals, nice environments, good voice acting. Music can be repetitive at certain times, but overall alright.

Now story isnt anything groundbreaking, but fundamentally quite alright.
There are problems though. Character development of a lot of supporting characters is weak, to the point of questioning why did they even bother having them.
The progression of the story could be better too. It starts out quite slow and feels rushed towards the end.
The development of Lara, as a character, seems quite decent. Although some things could have been done better.

The gameplay is where it has the most issues. The movement is clunky. I got the impression that game was meant to be more tilted towards stealth. It doesnt feel that well suited towards action gameplay. But towards the end you become a one man army and often stealth is in no way, shape or form an option. Not that I mind such gameplay, but considering this game is going for a serious tone, it kind of went overboard.
Combat often revolves around clearing tight locals of enemies or being swarmed in a broader area by enemies. They are either melee or ranged soldiers and throughout the game they start being buffed by armor and grenade throwing. Conceptually its alright, but there was always a feeling that it lacked finesse. If there were say, less soldiers, the combat was slower, but more tactically demanding, then I think it would have been a better experience.
Level design can at times feel irritating, when you are trying to figure out, where is the next twist you need to make in order to get where you want. Its trying to confuse you and that doesnt feel fun.
In the game there are also several types of collectibles and challenges you need to find and clear. A lot of them are just fluff that add almost nothing to the story or gameplay. They're just there to clear out and waste time.
Exploring and traversing the island is a hit and miss. Sometimes its fun, but sometimes it can feel shallow. The action scenes and events are usually fun where you need to escape a collapsing environment, but they can feel few and far in between if you dont stick to the main story line all the time.

One thing I noticed that kinda bothers me. Why did all the white male characters die and all the minority characters survived? Is it that stunning and brave thing again?

There are some other gripes I could discuss, but I think I got the point across.
Its not a bad game, but it doesnt push the potential that it sets up. A lot of things feel mediocre, with the odd very cool moment shinning through.

The bads:
1) story and characters - wherever and whatever. Nothing is memorable, no one is memorable, Lara is just barely a character
The goods:
1) Gameplay. Deadass. If you want some really fun 3rd person shooter, go for the whole trilogy. The shooting in this game is super fun, It's among the best!
It also has epxloration-metrodvania style of gameplay, so there are a lot of new weapons, upgrades, new abilities, and so on.
I often see this game being compared to Uncharcted, while yeah, both games are cinematic adventure games, this is just a 3rd person shooter metrodvania. it's just too different and kinda unique, can't think of any other game like it
Great game, with great gameplay, and extremely
fun to shoot people, but the story is meh.

Crazy to think this may be the last time I talk about the Tomb Raider games with this being the last one (unless the rumours about a new Tomb Raider prove me wrong otherwise), I'm not really interested in continuing the rest of this trilogy of Lara's fetch quest in following her father's footsteps. I'm not convinced I'll enjoy the rest of the and I think this is a nice stopping spot for this franchise. 

Just a disclaimer, this is probably my first time, or of recent playing a survival horror RPG TP game, so most of my high praises for this game comes from my lack of experience with those sorts of games, and I know there are probably better ones, like Uncharted and the Last of us, but I'm not planning on playing those games. 

Speaking on that, Tomb Raider is a good substitute or a start-up if you want to get into those sorts of genres, the premise is somewhat like the King Kong movie if the last 2 were good. Ship crashes, you're stuck on a mysterious island, you're hunting for food, shelter, and warmth,  some people want to eat you there's a lot of supernatural s*** going on, the island has a lot of embodied secrets for you to discover and figure out. You know what, by itself, this could make a good turn-your-brain-off movie for the amount of endurance Lara had to the point she still has an untreated hole in her gut, I only realise this a couple of days after finishing this game. Sorry, I'm rambling now, where am I going with this? 

I came into this game spoiler-free by ignoring it thinking nothing much about it, but as soon as I played it, it become one of the most fun experiences I had from an older big corporation game. The controls like the combat/ gunplay and platforming/ parkouring just flow well together with the weather affecting the realistic environment as well traversing through a makeshift landscape feeling nice making the game immersive, not point it doesn't feel like a game. There's still some simple tomb raiding with some clever puzzles to solve if you to earn more XPs for Lara to learn more skills. If you can't figure it out right away you can always come back with a campfire fast travel system that allows you to revisit and backtrack any areas you want to finish exploring once you unlock the necessary skills or equipment for it, like being able to climb on walls. 

Even with all those praises so far, there are still some things some problem with this game, like the new character being nothing too interesting, just bland and a bit one-note. The other problem it has it appears there's a disconnect between the cutscene cinematic team and the gameplay developer due to how chaos Lara has to go through, like surviving from a waterfall, a plane crash, or an endless swarm of enemies attacking her, but every time we see the side characters in a new location they somewhat manage to get there unscathed avoiding all the danger, like really? I know this sort of problem isn't unique to this, more so an annoying nitpick for me, but if hear another character asking me What took you so long?', I'll just pretend to give them a death stare at them thinking 'seriously, do you not see what I have to do to get here?'

Before I go overboard with nitpicking, I gonna say I probably like this newer version of Lara Croft a lot more than previous games, I'm not the only one to say that she's a lot more sympathetic and relatable starting as this innocent archaeologist with knowledge wanting to learn and explore other culture. Her vulnerable side is highlighted when making a tricky decision, like killing someone and crying over it, (I would do the same thing if I was in her shoes), making her emphasise that I can't help support her on her journey. Like most video games, it was nice to see Lara Croft as the protagonist get a lot of developments whilst progressively through the game becoming more confident and in tune with her situation. Before she was afraid of the enemies, but now the enemies know her name and are afraid of her, [spoiler]especially when she's carrying a grenade launcher toward them, that was a badass moment I have to say. [/spoiler]

[h1]Final Conclusion and a Goodbye: [/h1]

Yay, what an amazing game this was with a lot of action, a gorgeous scene, and some interesting lore surrounding it. Sometimes, I wonder why I skipped this game for all those years but I'm glad I finally played it a little later so I can have much more of an appreciation and some sort of adult nostalgia toward it when I get a lot older (if that's a thing). 

If there's a Tomb Raider game to start, begin with this one, even if you're playing it standalone story this game is highly recommended to almost everyone. 

I didn't think I'll be reviewing this game as well as the other older Tomb Raider trilogy this year. Apparently, I have a lot to say about them, but I am glad I manage to get my opinion out there, which was mostly positive, thankfully. Check out the other review of the previous Tomb Raider trilogy if you're interested in my thoughts, here's a small summary: 
[hr][/hr][list]
[*]Tomb Raider Anniversary- No
[*]Tomb Raider Legend - High recommendation to start off
[*]Tomb Raider Underworld-Nich high recommendation 
[/list]

Either way, thank you for reading my rambling, sorry if I was all over the place, I hope you'll have a fun experience with this game if you decided to play it. 

Finally, I can say goodbye and farewell to this series.",1671401658,1684018571,True,2,0,0.510719418525695801,0,True,False,False

I honestly liked Tomb Raider more than I thought it would. I came in here expecting a poor man's Uncharted clone. After finishing the game I am left with wanting more. It is very similar to the Uncharted games, albeit it does do unique things to distinguish itself from the former. Most notably the somewhat more open level design. It is still very linear but you are sometimes faced with larger ""hub-like"" areas and optional tombs (which are just a single puzzle) which are largely missing from the Uncharted games.

Let's move away from the Uncharted comparisons and speak on what the game does. Gameplay is split between traversal and combat. For traversal, all you do is wander down often linear paths with minor platforming challenges and easy puzzles. Combat has two approaches, stealth and guns blazing. Both of these styles of combat are marred by very poor AI. AI are often comically oblivious in stealth and during a gunfight, enemies will often exit cover and walk in a straight line towards your position. Gun-play is also nothing to write home about and stealth is way too shallow to even bother with. Even with all these complaints, I still enjoyed my time during battles. They were like junk food, fun but nothing special.

I'm not sure if this is an apt comparison, but the story gave me heavy Indiana Jones vibes which I like a lot. The story was an enjoyable action filled romp. Although the beginning of the game makes you expect something more gritty but then turns into something more akin to Uncharted (I'm sorry for bringing it up again). I'm not very good at critiquing narratives as I am easily pleased, so I will leave off saying that I simply enjoyed the story.

Lastly, my technical experience was fairly good. The game ran amazingly but had issues with the UI. Certain UI elements that flashed on screen when going near an interactable or trying to grab ammo that you are full on are cut off at the top left of the screen. Thankfully nothing essential was cut off but it was still annoying nonetheless. Also, voice audio and sound fx audio were combined in settings for some reason. Music was not thankfully, but sometimes sound fx drowned out dialogue which is somewhat remedied by subtitles. Other than those issues, the game ran extremely well with no noticeable frame drops or crashes.

tl;dr
Tomb Raider is definitely worth playing because of its fun narrative and enjoyable albeit easy gameplay.",1655587216,1683504391,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I purchase all three of very cheaply for the price of £15 as steam had a very good sale on around three weeks ago, 
I've been playing the the first one of the three for the first, two and half weeks, which I had finish around then.
I've always been a fan of tomb raider and Ms Croft and not having played any of the TR games since probably the PS1 days, I was very eager to get going. I have to be honest and say what an absolute gem of a game graphics are immense really grips you makes you feel like your actually there, game play I can't fault neither sound effects are outta this world from animal noises to you stepping on a twig an it snappin', storyline and journey through out the game had me gripped and even a little emotionally involved at times as the tale unfolded....it really is an amazing game and would reconmmend it to anyone that's into that kinda thing.

2. А если серьёзно, то я не понимаю, почему Ларе Крофт, всей из себя такой умной, понадобилось целых 3-4 дня, что бы понять что происходит на острове?
Я тоже не верю в подобный бред, но когда тебе прямым текстом говорят и даже показывают на деле, что на острове правит какая то мёртвая императрица-ведьма-повелитель погоды-демон, даже я, со своими 10 iq понял бы.
3. Жаль очкарика, буквально умер за отвёртку и гаячный ключ на 12-14. Самая бесполезная смерть в этой игре, даже убийство мужика в подземелье одичалыми мужиками имела больше смысла и трагедии. Только представь, мужик попал на остров, его завербовали и что бы проверить его на прочность, бросают в клетку с потерявшими свою человечность мужикам как корм. И сравни это с дурачком который пошёл на корабль полный врагов с автоматами и луками, что бы в итоге достать блядскую отвёртку и ключ, и сдохнуть с довольной рожей.
4. Тупость Матиаса тоже поражает, он прожил на острове как минимум с 1980-ых, и всё что смог узнать, так это то, что императрицу нужно возродить...... Даже тупоголовая Лара смогла за 4 ДНЯ найти и гробницу и нужные записи про императрицу, и те же записки которые не влияют на сюжет, а этот Осёл за 30 лет нет.
5. Мало слюней, хоть главный герой и девушка, сценаристы не сделали из неё типичную нюню, что очень приятно, каждая смерть проводиться с несколькими минутами траура и сожаления, после чего она возвращается в строй и в тоже время не забывая о случившемся. Кароче персы сделаны кайфово, помимо очкарика блять.
6. Глядя на эскизы, предоставленные разработчиком, локаций прямо в игре, становится немного обидно, насколько маленькая и сжатая вышла карта, хотя учитывая способы передвижения Лары, можно было сделать их более просторными и красочными.

First things First - This is not your childhood tomb raider. Old school was a barrage of puzzles, deadly animals, booby traps and clunky controls; as you led indiana jones-esque lara through crazy ruins and the odd modern town/building.

This is an origin / reboot for the series, and it plays much more like uncharted or arguably even gears of war (albeit with the cover mechanics and chain saws replaced with stealth and bows).
It is a tale of a much younger and inexperienced lara croft finding herself stranded on a mysterious isle full or insane survivors, wild game, and ancient samurai. 

Gameplay: Controls for the most part work and feel soooooooo good which is huge relief after the robotronic controls of the ps1 and ps2 era games. It has the arbitrary rpg elements that every other game feels the need to have in there too - earn xp to unlock perks, find collectibles for more xp, supplies to upgrade weapons. 

         The majority of the weapons feel great as do most of the upgrades. The bow works great for hunting and long range stealth kills, pistol is a trusty close-mid range weapon, assault rifle for when the shit hits the fan.
Silencer upgrades feel somewhat unnecessary and honestly do little to help. It also commits (what is in my mind) an annoying and common trope - shotgun has almost zero range. If you've ever shot a shotgun in real life, you probably know you can hit target with a good portion of the pellets in the shell from more than 3 feet away, and most of the pellets don't spray in a 180 degree arc. It certainly doesn't hinder the gameplay but it's one of those little things you commonly see like no-noise silencers that bug people who really like accurate portrayals of the little things.

The story is good but nothing breakthrough and revolutionary. Be forewarned the game is VERY cringe inducing at times. Some of the scenes are pretty brutal especially for something labeled Tomb Raider - many of the death sequences might disturb those of a gentle sensibility. It does not feel good to watch a 16/17ish year old girl get impaled through the torso on a gigantic tree branch or strangled to death D:

The hidden tombs were neat little puzzles with big rewards and were entertaining to do. I wish there was a few more or at that they had been a little longer/more challenging.

However those few tiny things did very little to detract from the overall experience. If I had any good honest-to-god complaints about it, there are three and one (few people in multiplayer which is kinda meh imho) is not something everyone will care about. 
The other complaints which I feel is very valid: 

(1)There were too many sequences where you had to run in what was essentially a straight line while the bridge, building, plane wreck, etc. was being blown to hell and you jump or slide down some stuff. There is one in almost every major area. After the second or third  time they lose the excitement and feel very cliche.

(2) Too much quick time stuff. I don't mind it much but there are a lot of uneeded button prompts, short QTE's, and mashing X. I'm kind glad they were simple though, didn't have to really repeat any: stick to shake loose, combat prompt is almost always Y on my pad, grabbing or mashing stuff was always x. While simple QTE's certainly aren't entertaining, these did not interrupt a rad cutscene orhad to be attempted multiple times *coughhrmmcough* Resident Evil 4 krauser knife fight *COUGH COUGH*


Overall though: Pretty darn entertaining. Tight controls, fair combat, some good platforming and puzzles and a campaign that'll last you 8-12 hours. And it looks fan-freakin-tastic, especially with if you can run everything at top settings. Would have appreciated less quicktime events or tap x, and pew pew explosion running sequences. Unless you have the patience to find decent sized multiplayer matches and enjoy them, I'd probably wait for it to go on sale even if it was only 15% off.",1413616963,1683065901,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

in general this is a good game buy it on a discount.

what i didn't like 

your friends are cast of slasher movie you waiting for them to die but some survive 

main support character and the only likable friend Gabriel Roman killed  pointlessly. 

the main villain is king tommy. 

the camera is hopping around which cause nausea.

the weapon are comically oversize except the bow.

no dual guns.

if the game ended by the half point it will be perfect after this point the story drag and repeat same plot few times.

there was no reference to older franchises eidos like what uncharted done.

one positive point it take from uncharted and improve on it I recall tomb raider quality was in decline after the original trilogy. 

there was no crashes like Castlevania: Lords of Shadow trilogy.",1682539866,1682539866,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is fine but I didn't find myself invested in the characters more just the plot. Didn't like how you never really travel with a friend outside of a cutscene. I didn't care for anyone when they died because I didn't spend any time with them. The plot is interesting and unique however.

The combat is fine but is quite boring. Also the visuals on the Assault rifle for example are awful. The gun itself has no recoil on Lara but the bullets just come out the barrel in random directions. it looks terrible.  

The climbing and platforming is pretty fun but can be glitchy. Too many times I fell when I pressed climb or was going for a zipline. QTE's are really bad at the start but happen less often later. The small world environments on the island you can explore with secrets are a nice touch to give more for the player to do, but why allow the player to do everything the first time they are there? You get abilities later like the rope ascender but only use it in the place you unlocked it and beyond. Why not have puzzles or areas only accessible by going back after the story with the new abilities to keep the player interested after? The tombs are literately just one puzzle that takes like 2 mins to figure out and do. Way too short but sweet enough.

I actually managed to find my way to a story section you are not meant to access after beating the story and my 100% save is just bugged at some place I can't escape because it saved when I got down. Pray this doesn't happen to anyone else going for 100%. Not a bad reboot for Lara in the end.

The 2013 reboot is certainly easier to play than the OG, but the modernization comes at the cost of all the charm and everything that made the original unique.

The plot and characters are a bit bland, and the cutscenes and actions sequences aren't any better than the actual gameplay they interrupt.

Maybe it's the art direction, but it feels like a bridge between the brown era of early to mid 360 and PS3 titles and the photogrammertry + global illumination era of the Xbox One and PS4. Not quite photorealistic, not quite stylised, but very pretty and unique.

I love Tomb Raider's pacing; it never has a dull moment, and is far more action film than any previous TR game. And yeah, it definitely lost the puzzle + combat variety that the LAU era had, but I think it made sense for the era in which it released. As much as I love Legend and Underworld, I think it made sense to chase mass appeal, especially with the success of Uncharted and other third person shooters at the time. I do wish it focused a bit more on the 'tomb' part of 'tomb raider', because the devs clearly put so much thought into Yamatai and its history only for players to possibly completely miss all of it in search of the next combat arena. 

Lara herself is the game's strongest suit, as her transformation from scared shipwreck victim to vengeful, brutal, murderer gives shades of Jason from Far Cry 3, but not quite as successful. I know literally every reviewer has pointed out TR2013's ludonarrative dissonance, but I honestly don't think it's quite as bad as, say, Uncharted. It's clear that Yamatai is a place in which only the strong and brutal survive, as evidenced by Mathias and his Solarii. So it seems only natural that, trapped in an environment in which only the strong survive, Lara would quickly become even more violent than her enemies as she becomes increasingly desensitised and vengeful in her pursuit of both her friends and a way off the island. It's also kinda clear that Roth taught Lara survival skills, which definitely included fireams training. So when she shoots Nikolai in self-defence, it seems like it awakens something in her, kinda a feeling of 'well, I've killed one person and it wasn't that bad, so I'll kill anyone who stands in the way of getting home'.

idk, I might be rly misinterpreting Lara, but I also think there's definitely enough in the game to support such a read.

Speaking of combat, TR2013 has THE BEST pistol sound I've ever heard in a game. It's such a satisfying sound, especially as it reverberates around the environment. Actually, all the weapon sound effects are excellent, as are the shooting mechanics and even upgrade trees, which I normally hate. I rly love when games show your upgrades visually, so seeing Lara's guns change over the course of the game was super satisfying.

Oh! Also, istg there's a subtext of Big Sapphic Energy between Sam and Lara. I know the game tries to set up Alex as Lara's love interest, but it honestly feels so halfhearted and kinda like the result of a writer changing the love interest last minute because some producer said a non-straight relationship shouldn't be in the game. Again, I'm probably reading waaaaaay too much into this, but it's based on the way that Sam and Lara interact and how Lara's voice changes around her, the way they hug, and just general vibes lol. I'm honestly curious to know if in original drafts of the script, it was more overt, or if I'm just seeing stuff that's not even there.

Ultimately, I rly like Tomb Raider, and think it was a rly compelling starting point to the Survivor trilogy that neither sequel truly capitalised upon (especially Shadow). I'd totally recommend it, and still can't believe it's ten (10) years old???

I had to back down to build743.0 in steam because the HUD bugs out on larger monitors in latest patches (reports are that it expects monitors no larger than 24""). The game also has visual and gameplay issues if your frames are too high, so I had to use VSYNC to fix that. You also often have to reload checkpoints sometimes as Laura will suddenly refuse to do things like her climbing jump--almost quit right after the very first camp you find because of this when I spent 20 minutes trying to get the bow because the game was just bugging out. Kind of wild to me that these exist in a ten year old game they were just pumping up for resale due to the anniversary event.

As for the game itself, I bought this back in 2015 and didn't make it very far. Not sure why but it just didn't hold my interest. Decided to pick it up in 2023 during a lull in other games and liked it a lot. It surprisingly holds up fairly well, but it's definitely showing some age. Worth a play through, but there are a lot of QTEs and they're hard to decipher and a bit unforgiving, so some sequences get frustrating as it becomes ""do it over and over until you memorize the sequence."" The controls are also not intuitive and a bit unresponsive by today's standards. The menus are pretty, but actually pretty hard to navigate and certain things in the game are introduced poorly or just not at all (collectibles, side tombs, even your map). I enjoyed the story though so it kept me playing through until the end. I fairly naturally hit 80% completion without backtracking but I was probably ~50% through the game before I really figured out how to use the map/survival instinct. (That said I didn't look up guides / walkthroughs on purpose).

It's good but there's nothing here to make me want to do another playthrough or finish out that last 20%. I often like to 100% games, but not when so many of the achievements are for multiplayers. So liked the game and its worth a buy given how cheap it is now, but be prepared for some frustrating technical issues and gameplay that doesn't quite feel polished by modern standards for third person action adventure games.",1681415929,1681415929,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

The game follows the adventures of the iconic protagonist Lara Croft as she explores ancient ruins and solves puzzles in search of treasure and artifacts.

The game's graphics and visuals are impressive, with stunningly detailed environments and character designs that bring the game's world to life. The game's sound design is also excellent, with atmospheric music and sound effects adding to the overall immersive experience.

The game's combat mechanics are also well-designed, with a variety of weapons and tools available to Lara as she battles her way through enemies and obstacles. The game's puzzle-solving mechanics are also a highlight, challenging players to think creatively and use their problem-solving skills to progress through the game.

One potential downside of the game is its linear progression, which can make it feel somewhat restricted and limiting at times. However, this is offset by the game's engaging storyline and memorable characters.

Overall, Tomb Raider is a classic game that is still worth playing today. Its impressive visuals, engaging gameplay mechanics, and iconic protagonist make it a must-play for fans of the action-adventure genre.

Story is well-paced, focused, with clear progression in gameplay and visuals between areas. Environments are wonderfully hand-crafted and change with story events.

Collectables are few per area and actually interesting (you get to learn a bit about different historical artefacts). During the more intense sections, there are ZERO chests, collectables or side objectives. It's so amazing when you notice it compared to other games (middle of a burning building, before an obvious boss fight? Wait, better run around to find that 1 out of 250 copy-pasted collectable).

""Crafting"" is just a simple 1-resource upgrade system, because this is a action-adventure videogame, not a chore simulator. It encourages you to pick things up as you go but there is never any need to grind.

The main con is it's too easy. On hard mode, I was always full on ammo, and the only times I died was when I was messing around with melee specials. I appreciate that enemies aren't bullet sponges though.

Tombs are just mini-puzzles, one room with 2-3 moving parts, sometimes you have to time 1 jump or whatever. There are a couple of slightly longer puzzles but they're still straightforward.

I often do the first run through on normal or easy to get a feel for the game. After I play the more difficult levels.

The gameplay is remarkably fluid and effective, with smooth transitions between the numerous scripted events, the platforming and action or infiltration phases. All of those are very well made and the controls are a model of simplicity and efficacy (except for all the times I've lit a torch trying to pick up ammo!) The enemies' AI is pretty good and even packs a few surprises, though the 'bosses' were a little disappointing (partly relying on quicktime events, which I hate.) The 'enigmas' were a bit disappointing compared to the excellence of TROTR (the next opus in the series), some of them demanding menially repetitive movement and a few displaying no real logical structure, but they were all eventually manageable. 
The game's real strength is as a cinematic experience, bizarre as it sounds. Many (most?) AAA games try so hard to look like big budget movies: I often complain about it, because I'm not fond of big budget movies. Well the TR series tries and pulls it pretty well I have to say. The dialogues and voice-acting are pretty convincing, and although the story plays it safe, it holds its own in the face of many a Hollywoodian adventure flick. The various villains are really secondary characters, and the environment get's the lion's share of our attention, but the supporting crew is well fleshed out (though more screen time would have been better). Lara herself is well designed and animated. She lacks perhaps a little character but the 'survivor' theme is effectively narrated, particularly in the opening sequence. 
My only complaint: I nearly finished it in one sitting. That says something to the game's quality (I seldom 'binge') but it also says something to its length. I played on hard (and I am not particularly 'good' at games usually) and I found it all too easy. What content there is in there, is dazzling, but compared to the following opus, there's just not enough of it.

203160,135512478,76561199434389924,0,4,994,0,994,1679871753,"For a reboot of a series that had lost its focus and purpose, gathering fifteen years of baggage over the course of nine games, this new shot at it shows remarkable confidence. It has all the pieces of a third-person action title, but it's also isn't rushing for completion.

This version gives us a younger version of Lara Croft, an archaeology-obsessed young woman eager to follow in her father’s footsteps, and her group bound toward the stormy islands of The Dragon's Triangle. When her ship crashes, separating her from the crew, she's forced to explore, survive and uncover the mystery of the island's strange, hostile inhabitants.
Lara doesn’t start off as the badass heroine that we know from her earlier games. Instead, she starts off as a survivor of her shipwreck looking for the missing crew. That isn’t to say she doesn’t turn into that person; her transformation takes place within the first few hours of the game. As Lara pushed through narrow caves, crawled along ledges, killed her first animal and scavenged for parts. Lara's first kill is the game's first dramatic crescendo, a moment of genuine emotional impact; but that doesn’t last long. She goes from a terrified survivor to a reluctant killer looking for blood in an instant. She had to get used to killing quickly, and so does the player.

The freedom that this game provides when exploring is refreshing. The Dragon's Triangle isn't an open world exactly, but it's far from a jungle-themed series of hallways. Each of the major locations has multiple zones, which most of them are wide open for you and Lara to explore at your own leisure. You can breeze through the game quickly, going from checkpoint and objective to checkpoint and objective, or you can take your time and explore your surroundings (which, in my opinion, is the best way the play). If you decide to explore, each side path and every lone, faraway cliff has a bonus waiting—whether it be salvage, boxes, ammo, or a lost relic or document that helps you piece together the history of the island.

Lara periodically discovers new weapons, injecting the combat with fresh novelty every few hours; and whether you’re fighting with a bow, a shotgun, a pistol, or a rifle, the combat is probably one of my favorites in a series. Each area is populated with combat encounters that follow the same open-ish design that the game carries. If you want to sneak around, you can take out enemies with stealthy melee kills and well-placed headshots from your bow. If you want to run in firing your assault rifle, more enemies will be alerted to your presence, but it is satisfying to watch them all die by your hand. The game throws in explosives, vertical level design, multiple points of entry for bad guys and tons of other wrinkles to the combat that help make each scenario stand out.

This new take on the series is cinematic yet open, intense yet laid-back, fresh yet polished.",1679871946,1679871946,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This game was very thrilling and I enjoyed a lot. I felt like I'm controlling a character in an action movie. (2) Difficulty of the game was good. I played ""normal"" but sometimes I had to repeat the same battle many times to beat all enemies. Overall it's not too easy and not too difficult. It was really right difficulty for me. (3) I liked the fact that I can redo the same battle or scene right before Lara dies. If I had to redo way back from the beginning, I would give up but I can redo right before Lara dies. (4) I'm using an office desktop PC with a low-profile graphic card but the game worked fine on 780p screen, and graphic looks nice to me even though this game was released in 2013. (5) I liked that navigation system when I press L1 button, any interactive objects near me light up. That's nice system and very player-friendly. (6) Controlling of the character was excellent with great movement and actions.CONS:(1) I don't like so much playing game where people kill people. I didn't expect that Lara has to kill hundreds of people in the game. I enjoyed the game anyway but I prefer that the enemies are not human. (2) Sometimes I have no idea which way to go or to jump, so I tried to go or jump and as a result Lara dies: Lara can climb up a 15-feet tall building, yet she can not climb up a 6-feet random rock in the game. (3) Once I finished the game, there are some items to collect or some places to go but I may not be playing after the completion. The very first play-through is the most enjoyable. There is not really addictive elements in this game that you want to play over and over again. (4) Online game is not working.Overall, I highly recommend this game!",1679760937,1679760937,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Pros[/b]

[*]Thrilling and immersive gameplay that keeps you engaged from start to finish, perfect for any Decepticon looking for a challenge
[*]Stunning graphics and visuals that bring the world of Tomb Raider to life, just like our beloved planet Cybertron
[*]Compelling story that makes you care about the characters and their struggles, something even Megatron can appreciate

[u]Cons[/u]

[*]Some of the puzzles can be frustrating and feel like a chore to complete, much like the human's constant attempts to resist our rule over the universe
[*]The game can be quite linear at times, limiting exploration and player choice, but as Decepticons, we know the importance of staying focused on our mission

[i]Final Verdict[/i]

As a proud Decepticon, I was intrigued to experience this reboot of the Tomb Raider series from a human's perspective. However, I found myself thoroughly enjoying the game's exciting gameplay, stunning graphics, and compelling story, despite some minor frustrations with the puzzles and linearity. If you're looking for a great action-adventure game that will keep you engaged from start to finish, I highly recommend giving this game a try, even if you have to temporarily put aside your plans for energon extraction. Who knows, you may even gain a better understanding of the human race and their fascination with these so-called ""video games.""",1679368791,1679571251,True,2,1,0.538461565971374512,0,True,False,False

Das Spiel wurde von Crystal Dynamics entwickelt und von Square Enix veröffentlicht. Es ist ein Neustart der Tomb Raider-Serie, welcher 2013 stattfand, und bietet eine neue Interpretation des Charakters und der Handlung.

Die Grafik des Spiels ist, auch im Jahr 2023 für damalige, Verhältnisse immer noch atemberaubend und die Umgebungen sind sehr detailliert gestaltet. Von schneebedeckten Bergen bis hin zu dunklen Höhlen, jede Umgebung hat ihren eigenen Charme und ihre eigenen Herausforderungen. Die Charaktermodelle sind ebenfalls sehr gut gestaltet und verleihen den Figuren eine hohe Detailgenauigkeit.

Die Handlung des Spiels ist fesselnd und bietet viele überraschende Wendungen. Lara muss auf einer mysteriösen Insel überleben und ihre Freunde retten, während sie sich mit einer unbekannten Bedrohung auseinandersetzt. Die Geschichte wird sehr gut erzählt und lässt den Spieler tief in das Spiel eintauchen.

Das Gameplay ist sehr gut gestaltet und bietet eine Mischung aus Action, Rätseln und Erkundung. Das Kampfsystem ist flüssig und macht Spaß, während die Rätsel herausfordernd und lohnend sind. Das Spiel hat auch eine Vielzahl von Sammelgegenständen und optionalen Herausforderungen, die es dem Spieler ermöglichen, die Welt vollständig zu erkunden.

Insgesamt ist Tomb Raider ein hervorragendes Spiel, das jedem empfohlen werden kann, der Action-Abenteuer-Spiele liebt.

I played this entirely on Steam Deck. I completed the main campaign and most of the collectibles and upgrades (for a 95% completion). I was able to play on Ultra settings using Proton experimental.

NOTE: Don't make the same mistake I did and change your proton version without backing up your save first. I lost my first 6 hours doing this due to poor performance on the normal version of proton.

I grew up with the PlayStation 1 classics and have loved this franchise for decades. This reboot gave the franchise new life. It didn't feel like a cash grab, and the people working on it knew what made a good Tomb Raider game. The story had depth, even though it was a bit predictable at times, and the world felt alive. With wildlife running around, lush greenery, rushing water everywhere, and the ancient villages, this felt like a truly lived in world. The mystery surrounding the island and how you uncover it felt well paced. There was never a dull moment.

When you encounter hostile wildlife (only a few wolves), and the other unfortunate inhabitants of the island, the game does a good job of introducing you to combat mechanics. It worked well slow rolling it, because at this stage Lara Croft is not the bad-ass we have known for 25+ years. She is a young girl in it for the discovery. She hadn't been put into dangerous situations like this. As you gear up and learn new skills the combat feels pretty satisfying overall, but gets repetitive. Especially since all the encounters happen at scripted times. It works in this game though with the story driven and cinematic approach they took with the game.

The characters are not bad, but they also are not great. Some are pretty memorable, but very predictable. You also don't really grow attached to any of them other than Lara. Not a bad thing, since she is the heroine in this story and is told from her perspective, but it would have been nice to care more about the other members in your party.

In addition to the campaign there are collectibles in each area, camps which you can fast travel between, and hidden tombs. None of it feels out of place, since she is an archeologist first and foremost, collecting relics and exploring tombs feel natural. Later in the game you can unlock skills to help make collecting item easier as well.

My only real complaints with the game came from the shaky camera during cinematics, and the number of quicktime events. Nothing that detrimental though.

Overall, I really enjoyed this game. More than I thought I would. I was engaged from beginning to end, and it felt like a proper reboot to a beloved franchise.",1679286837,1679286837,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Awesome action-adventure and a great reboot to a beloved franchise! Lara Croft was long overdue for a modern new look and deserves all the praise for her legacy in the video game industry. The devs did a great job and poured all their passion into this game. It is well balanced with action and exploration sequences. The tombs are basically environmental puzzles and are easy to solve. Some would criticize that they lack complexity, but I'm on the side that they are serviceable and fit the story and the island setting. Since I mentioned the story, have to say that it is OK and keeps you invested to see the ending. The graphics are good and I took plenty of screenshots of beautiful vistas. The sound design is solid and the gameplay is smooth. Whether you explore and traverse the environment, or shoot and melee your opponents, you are always in control. Since this game was released in 2013, it runs extremely well on modern PC's. With Ultra settings I never saw less then 100 FPS. If you are a fan of the genre, definitely play this ~10 hr. adventure.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",1562187257,1679241840,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Similar to Assassin´s Creed 2/3/4, but only one island. 
- The fights are fun for the most part, though some things are too forced(!) and I hate button-smashing.. stupid console-gamer moments, where you can see it´s a console game ;(
- Don´t expect much choice.. every scene is linear! 
- Upgrading is decent and the camps (hello Assasin´s Creed^^) well placed.
- 5 weapons: Bow /Pistol /Shotgun /Rifle + ClimbingAxe for melee
- Weapon-Combos suck and fall flat compared to Assassin´s Creed -series
- Biggest downer: Bossfights.. everything is cast(!) - only one way to beat the boss, no matter how much Ammo + Grenades + Fire/Napalm you pour into them.. stupid ;((

I love the Tomb Raider franchise for it's puzzles and adventure, for having to figure out which ledge to climb, and having constant surprises, shooting some enemies, crawling through tight spaces. 

In this version of TR, ledges have white paint on them so you can almost play the game by just pressing random buttons.

After the first hour game just gives up, and becomes generic cover shooter with some jumping and puzzles.

PROS:
- Nice graphics.
- Good platforming.
- Puzzles are interesting.
- Weapon and skill upgrading is nice.
- Controls are precise and simple.

CONS:
- CAMERA IS CONSTANLY SHAKING! It does not matter if you are walking, talking, fighting or platforming. Camera shakes violently all the time.
- Story is first about survival, then about mystery. Main characters are complete morons, including Lara. This destroys any atmosphere, that story is trying to set.
- Main characters are acting painfuly stupid in cutscenes. Lara could have shot main villain a million times over the course of a game.
- Shooting feels like crap.
- Maybe worst shotgun of any game ever? Works ONLY at point-blank range even when fully upgraded.
- Cover mechanic is automatic - that means it is not working when you want to.
- Enemies are retarded cannon fodder. No tactics at all.
- ""Secret"" Tombs have entrances so visible, that many times I confused them with a main path. Writings on the wall, lit torches and sound alerting you, that there is ""Secret nearby"". Duh..
- Tombs are a joke. One large room with a chest, that you reach after solving one puzzle.
- Lara picks something from every treasure chest and because she does not have backpack, she just shove it up her as.s. We never see what she took. It makes discovering completely worthless.
- Lara never wears anything protective. Some jacket, or gloves. Anyone in survival situation would try to wear more than a tanktop.
- Lara becomes invincible, Rambo style - killing machine in the first half of a game.
- Lara with her spooked-sad face reloads weapons without looking, faster than a Terminator.
- On-rail sections are annoying and stupid. Everything is crumbling, shaking, exploding like in a Michael Bay movie.
- Too many QTE events. I hate them.
- After Lara is impaled or hurt, she forgets about it after the minute. Wolverine would envy her healing ability.
- Skulls, dead bodies, piles of corpses everywhere. How many people died on that island?  Few hundred thousand? A milion?
- Tons of continuity errors. If you drop something heavy and it makes a hole into concrete floor, you jump inside to find, that the big heavy object just dissapeared.
- Music and sound design are mediocre at best.
- Zero replayability.
- Ending is just unexpectedly bad. All is foreshadowed in second half of a game. No surprises, nothing. Who wrote this story anyway, bunch of teenagers? I was expecting some twist or something.


Game tries to impress how gritty and realistic it is, but fails miserably.
How could such a trainwreck of a game got 9/10 reviews is beyond me. I was expecting more, honestly.
Game was sitting in my Steam collection for so long, that I had to force myself through it at least once.
If you want good 3rd person action, play Witcher 3, Batman or Dead Space instead. Even repetitive Mad Max is better with all its vehicle battles.
I would refund this game if it was new released AAA title for 60 dollars. 
For 5 bucks it is OK.

203160,39013388,76561197969301810,307,4,1288,0,981,1444731170,"Lara is introduced as an unexperienced adventurer, although the way she picks up after being shipwrecked and thrown on an unforgiven island is feral. Survival is right. Despite open wounds she wades through waist-high baths of blood and guts. One would expect her to have raging fevers as one moment she dashes through volcanic caves and the next she’s climbing a radio tower that sways dangerously in a snow storm. So, scratch that former remark—this is no survival, it’s mythical. While her diligent band of cardboard friends struggles to find important things to do, she risks her life every single minute. That is, of course, how Lara ‘Grave Robber’ Croft came to be – as the first true female video game hero – but why, then, would the writers cast her in this at times toe-curling, teeth grinding fantastical pseudo-realistic-American-soap-like plot? Was it the contemporary fad of rehashing the heroes of old (e.g. Batman) in an emotional and profoundly human way? If we, one can hear the developers assert, salten Lara’s adventure with themes of loss, maternity, insanity, mass murder and resurrection, we surely will learn more about her, understand her, [i]care[/i] for her? 

The beauty of the first games was the fact that the introduction to the player was neutral and short, providing just enough incentive to become Lara. [b]In this reboot we are never Lara, merely the page-turners of her pre-written adventure[/b] - which wouldn't be that bad if the writing was engaging. But [b]the story is troubled with too many ideas and too little focus[/b], and I did not care about any cutscene, journal or conversation (except maybe for the sake of being a completionist, which is no accomplishment on the developers’ part). 

Nevertheless, [b]I actually enjoyed the gameplay very much[/b]. As with in all probability the entirety of the former Tomb Raider games, and similar third person (acrobatic) adventure games like the Assassin’s Creed series, it is troubled with moments of utter frustration, whenever there is a discrepancy between how you want to control the character, and how this gets interpreted by the game engine. Fortunately, this is not as common as in some parts of the aforementioned series. [b]Overall the movement is fluent[/b] (though their animations sometimes leave something to be desired), the input-to-control ratio is up to par, the weapon handling and ammo switching are good. And, above all, stealth is a welcome and well-implemented, albeit at times glitchy, addition.

Autosaves are frequent (at times too frequent even), and any kind of statistical progress is, as is common in this genre, saved immediately. 

[b]The skills that can be unlocked are usually ungratifying[/b]. It really is okay; it spices up the gameplay a little, but only a handful of skills actually give you an idea of improvement; these are mostly included in the brawling and weapon upgrade trees, adding new moves or types of ammo.

[b]Graphically, Tomb Raider is quite pretty and very well optimized[/b]. The atmosphere is arguably the best in the series, and the level design is rather good as well, as long as you don’t care too much about examining every nook and cranny. It obviously has been designed for a linear playthrough, turning the completionists’ endeavour into a galling burden.

[b]Verdict: Until the Tetanus DLC is here, or Lara learns to shipwreck in more distinctive company, Tomb Raider earns a mere 'mediocre'.[/b]",1514991178,1678525575,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well, let me start by saying that as a fan of the original series, I was skeptical about this new take on Lara Croft. But, after playing through the game and taking in all of its elements, I have to admit that this is a damn fine entry in the series.

Let's start with the story. Tomb Raider 2012 takes us back to the beginning of Lara Croft's journey, showing us how she became the confident, badass explorer that we all know and love. The story is well-written and keeps you engaged throughout, with plenty of action, drama, and twists to keep you on your toes. The character development is also top-notch, with Lara going through some serious trials and tribulations that really test her resolve.

As for the gameplay, Tomb Raider 2012 is a great blend of exploration, puzzle-solving, and action. The game is full of secrets to uncover, puzzles to solve, and enemies to take down. The combat is fast-paced and visceral, with plenty of weapons and upgrades to keep things fresh. The controls are tight and responsive, making for a satisfying experience overall.

But what really sets Tomb Raider 2012 apart is its presentation. The game looks absolutely stunning, with gorgeous environments, realistic character models, and impressive effects. The music and sound design are also top-notch, adding to the overall immersion of the experience.

In conclusion, Tomb Raider 2012 is a fantastic reboot of the series that manages to capture the spirit of the original games while updating them for a modern audience. The story, gameplay, and presentation are all top-notch, making this a must-play for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike",1678359097,1678359097,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]A mysterious island full of environmental puzzles, intense combat and tombs to explore[/h1]

[i]Tomb Raider GOTY Edition[/i] is a third-person action, adventure video game developed by pioneering American developer 🇺🇸, Crystal Dynamics, who has been commissioned to develop every [i]Tomb Raider[/i] game since 2006.

With energetic combat and amazing tombs to discover across a mysterious island, this title [b]gives a second reboot[/b] to the life of Lara Croft as we knew her before, and takes her to the edge of her possibilities with this [b]new proposal that tells her origins[/b] from a different perspective.

In this revamped instalment, we take on the role of the young and innocent Lara Croft, who has just graduated with top honours from Cambridge University in London, UK 🇬🇧. However, her eagerness to embark on her own adventure and make her mark on the archaeological world as her father, Richard Croft, did, leads her to take an expedition to the end of the world to the Dragon Triangle in southern Japan 🇯🇵 in search of the location of a lost civilisation known as the Yamatai.

The Game of the Year Edition version of the video game, which is more like a bundle in itself, brings with it all the DLC released to date for [i]Tomb Raider[/i] in 2013, including the [i]Tomb Raider: 1939 Multiplayer Map Pack[/i] and [i]Tomb of the Lost Adventure[/i] DLCs. The latter allows us to unlock and explore an additional tomb, but without the possibility of getting a later achievement by looting it.

In total, [b]21 DLCs are added to the base game[/b], but nothing new is added, such as graphical improvements or a rebalancing of the combat system. A release that, rather than saticfastoria, was a mere whim on Square Enix's part to highlight the fact that the title has been awarded and pressed by the press on many occasions.

[b]Score: 95[/b]

[b]Pros:[/b]
■ An amazing story-rich that takes us to the origin of Lara without further delay.
Three difficulty modes that expand the length of the story.
■ Most comprehensive collectibles list in the entire series (100 in total).
■ Survival instinct is original and profitable at all times.
■ Realistic graphics that take advantage of new technologies.
■ An exceptional soundtrack and outstanding sound effects.
■ Camilla Luddington's performance as Lara Croft is excellent.

[b]Cons:[/b]
■ The GOTY version of the title doesn't come with any relevant extra content to make you want to pay for it in the first place.
■ Extremely short campaign to finish (between 15-20 hours).
■ A Very limited weapon list.
■ Aiming is weak on a few firearms, making them difficult to use.
■ Few challenges when exploring tombs with negligible rewards.
■ A New Game would have increased the replayability of the title.

It's a reboot of the classic Tomb Raider franchise, but this time Lara Croft isn't just a pair of pixelated boobs with guns - she's a realistic, relatable, and badass character who you'll love to play as.

You get to see Lara grow from a scared and vulnerable survivor to a confident and skilled adventurer. It's like watching your little sister become a superhero, except with more bow and arrow action.

The graphics are stunning - seriously, you'll be blown away by the lush environments and detailed character models. It's like going on a virtual vacation, except with more murder.

The puzzles are challenging, but not so hard that you'll want to throw your controller at the wall. Plus, solving them makes you feel like a genius, even if you had to look up the answer online.

There's a ton of exploration to do, and you can spend hours just wandering around the island, searching for hidden treasures and artifacts. It's like playing an Indiana Jones game, but with more wolves.

The combat is intense and satisfying, especially when you pull off a headshot with your trusty bow. It's like playing a game of darts, except the dart board is a guy's face.

Lara's death scenes are hilariously gruesome - you'll laugh, you'll cringe, and you'll wonder how she manages to survive half the stuff that happens to her. It's like playing a game of Operation, except the patient is Lara Croft and you're using guns instead of tweezers.

The story is gripping and emotional, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. It's like watching an action movie, except you're the one controlling the action.

There's a lot of replayability, with different difficulty levels and challenge modes to keep you coming back for more. It's like eating a bag of chips - you tell yourself you're just going to have one, but before you know it, the whole bag is empty.

Did I mention the wolves? Seriously, there are so many wolves. If you love killing wolves, this game is for you. If you hate killing wolves, this game is still for you, because it's really satisfying when you kill them.",1677705667,1677705667,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics surprisingly hold up at 2023,  Lara looks far better than I remembered, but the look of side characters still belong to Xbox360 era.

Gameplay is surprisingly Michael Bay, so many explosions and so many escape from collapsing building moments. Tomb Raider(2013) is more like a third person shooter game than a 3rd person adventure game, it’s basically the opposite of Shadow of Tomb Raider, which emphasizes more on exploring and puzzle solving than fighting.
But as a Tomb Raider game, the tombs in this game are disappointing, every tomb is just one puzzle, yep, you solved one puzzle and you get the treasure. It’s lame as hell.

Story is surprisingly ok overall . In summary,  Lara gets constantly tortured in the first 2 hours, and in the whole game, she only wears a low tank top while fighting waves of fully equipped enemies, it’s kinda funny. 

As the first game of Tomb Raider Trilogy, Tomb Raider(2013) is doing very well, replayed this game in 2023, it is just stupid fun for 10 hours(if you want to 100% the game, that will be 17 hours).

Tomb Raider is an action-adventure game that serves as the reboot of the series focusing on how Lara transforms from a young and inexperienced archeology graduate into a hardened and capable explorer, unafraid to kill as a means to survive.

Lara embarks on a journey to find a long-forgotten empire of Yamatai. Her ship is destroyed by a storm and her team gets separated. They fight for their survival and uncover the island's secrets, revealing the ancient curse that had trapped them on the island with the Solarii cultists. The team has to find and save each other and break the curse to get off the island.

The graphics of this game are dated by now but some of the locations are beautiful nonetheless. In combination with the soundtrack, a lot of locations made for an amazing atmosphere.

Gameplay is from 3rd personal point of view and involves quite a bit of gunfights, puzzles, some collectibles, and an interesting traversal of the environment that will have you do a lot of climbing and running. It should be noted that this game has no small amount of cinematic moments and will have you running from falling caves and desperately trying not to die using quick time events on several occasions. Some people might find those very cool and enjoyable but I personally don't really like those. The game is structured into several hubs with their own tombs and collectibles. Each of the hubs has a map to be found, which reveals the locations of places and collectibles. All areas also have a few campfires that are used for upgrading weapons and learning new skills. The exploration of some areas is obstructed by various blockages for which you will need special gear that can be acquired by progressing the story. 

Puzzles are found all throughout the game, some in tombs, some to get you through the story, and even small ones that make simple looting more interesting.

The game offers 5 weapon types: Bows, Pistols, Rifles, Shotguns, and Melee. Each can be upgraded using salvage. Some weapons are found, given to Lara, or crafted from weapon parts. One thing to be noted here is that the weapon parts seem to be part structured and part randomized and you will want to loot all enemies to collect all of them which might be frustrating for some.

In conclusion, it is definitely a good game, worth playing, especially when being very often on discount.  8/10

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki ""Yagoo"" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I...

I have played every single Tomb Raider games from the Tomb Raider 1 to the Shadow of the Tomb Raider. And one is my top pick. The one I liked most. It's the best Tomb Raider game I've ever played. I remember the first time I played it, it was years ago. That experience was something else. The hostile environment and the surviving part. The challenge tombs.. the exploration. Never felt boring. And I actually managed to finish the game with 100% completion and all the achievements(except the multiplayer ones because mp is dead as of now)
This game made me like the new Lara Croft more than the older ones. Many will disagree with me. But I like this Lara Croft more. Even more than the next two games. Would've been better if it had more tombs to explore and more boss fights. But regardless of that I liked it so much. I loved each and every locations. Some of my favorite locations were the Mountain village, coastal bluffs, shanty town, the cliffside village and gondola transport.

This game is an origin story for Lara Croft. She's not yet the tomb-raiding, dual pistol-wielding badass heroine we know her as, but rather an innocent and inexperienced adventurer on a journey to a mysterious island in the Pacific. Without getting into spoilers, things go awry during the journey and Lara and her compatriots end up getting stranded on the island and soon discover their arrival on the island was more than an accident. 

The gameplay is divided between shooting, some light platforming, and exploration. You'll be doing all three in fairly equal measure, although some parts of the game will put more of an emphasis on one than the other. The shooting feels pretty good and you're given plenty of cool and useful upgrades for your weapons to better dispatch anything that gets in your way. The platforming is fun and definitely reminds me of the climbing and jumping in Uncharted 2. There are a few moments where it seems like there's some invisible force helping you make long jumps and guiding you towards ledges and hand-holds, and some of the animations are a bit janky, but overall your options for traversal are quite varied. Speaking of Uncharted, the game takes more than a few pages out of Uncharted's book - which isn't necessarily a bad thing seeing as the OG Tomb Raider games likely inspired the Uncharted series - when it comes to action sequences, which the game has in spades. Lastly, the exploration rewards the careful and patient gamer with upgrades, diary entries that flesh out the characters and story, and other special goodies. There's a fairly well-implemented fast travel system but it doesn't always let you go to the area you need to go to, rather the closest checkpoint to it. So be ready to do a bit of travelling on foot.

Now, I know that the term ""ludonarrative dissonance"" gets tossed around quite frequently these days, but the game does suffer from this quite a bit. While Lara is scarred by the many acts of violence she witnesses (and later has to commit in order to survive) she begins to become such a brutal killer by the end of the game that you wouldn't be wrong if you begun to believe she got some sick enjoyment out of it. There are some late-game kill and takedown animations that would fit into any Gears of War or Manhunt title. As well, Lara takes quite the beating throughout the game, sustaining any number of life-threatening injuries. After a while it almost becomes silly to see how many times she survives something that should have gotten her killed, only for her to just get up, brush off the dust and blood, and keep going. It's a minor gripe, but one that kept rearing its head throughout my 15-hour playthrough.

Overall, if you're a fan of action games (or movies) and like exploring, shooting, and climbing, you'll almost certainly love Tomb Raider. While some of the animations might feel off and the game's mechanics can clash with the story, it's still a fitting reboot for one of gaming's most iconic and recognizable names.",1676878355,1676878355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the story is exactly what you'd expect and better from a lara croft game- plot twists, unsolved mysteries and lots of action. there are tons of secrets and extra details to be found, and you will never run out of things to explore. the origin story in this game is particularly well made, i like how it shows lara's struggles and doubts as she pushes herself to unleashing her full potential, which is something we rarely see nowadays in newer hero/action media. 

the characters are very multi-dimensional, each with their own unique quirks. lara is mild-mannered yet bold, reckless yet careful and timid yet fearless. this is so far my favourite version of the character, as she feels much more ""human"" via the showcase of her internal struggles.

the environment is beautiful, it was ahead of its time. the whole island is so immersive and brimming with secrets, you could still have a good time spending hours wandering around the island without any missions. 

the gameplay is phenomenal. the traversal never feels stiff, though i wish there was an option to sprint. the combat surprisingly does not get repetitive despite the lack of variety in terms of close-range attacks. the puzzles also are fairly challenging and require a bit of thought.

This completely ruins the game for me. There should be an option to either turn this off for players who do not want to kill animals or a foresting mode for vegan and vegetarian players. 

Requiring Lara to kill animals carries a hint of right wing survivalist propaganda. It would entirely feasible for Lara to conveniently retain a pack of canned food or something. Or just not really worry about a diet element to the game. I also believe that someone as well trained and accomplished as Lara would be able to find non-meat food, like plants or whatever. Besides, since this is a video game there could be nut protein or whatever else. There is no real reason to require the player to kill animals and I hate that this is a part of this game.

tomb raider is a third person action-adventure game developed by crystal dynamics and published by square enix limited, a european branch of square enix, in march of 2013. it's the 10th tomb raider game and acts as a reboot of the series, and also acting as the first part of the 'survivor trilogy' that came to be after the successful release. the purpose of the reboot was to re-establish the origins of lara croft, so in this game she is just a young archeology graduate. i really enjoyed the plot of this game and i can't wait to get into rise of the tomb raider just to continue the story. it's well-written and incredibly well-done. the one thing i had a 'problem' (if you can even call it that) is how fast lara transforms into a hardened killer capable of taking out multiple enemies at once.

gameplay is third person action-adventure, so you know what the gameplay is mostly gonna be like, but the fact there's survival elements, and uncharted-like combat, and even minor rpg elements makes this game unique enough to stand apart from competition as a really solid gameplay experience. the graphics are great, even though i'm making this review in february 2023, a month away from 10 years after the release, the graphics are high-quality and they really gave lara croft great characterization. the setting is great, i really enjoyed the myths and mysteries of the island. now that full price is only $15, you can still get this for 75-85% off, which is an absolute steal for one of the best series reboots of all time. i definitely reccomend waiting for a sale because getting this for around $3 is an insane value.",1675625878,1675625878,True,4,0,0.536526203155517578,0,True,False,False

- The graphics are nice (even I couldn't play it on ultra on my Steam Deck because of some framerate drops)
- The music fits totally with the adventure.
- The gameplay is good and fun and the only that I can criticize is the camera, too shaky and a pain a lot of times.

- The plot is boring, non-catchy at all, full of absurd and cliché moments, characters are irrelevant and totally forgettable.
- Tombs are great but short and simple.
- Multiplayer achievements (really??!!! I hate this!)

The Tomb Raider series has been through a lot during its existence, but in 2013, Crystal Dynamics said it would release the game ... Tomb Raider... (reboot). Which should provide the series with modern gameplay and a better story, but how did the fans take this reboot ?

[b]How did Lara become an adventurer?[/b]

In this installment, Lara is no longer a seasoned adventurer as we know her, here she is just a teenage girl searching for an area near Japan, which according to myths should be known as the Devil's Triangle, which was once held by the ruler of the world, but as things stand, when Lara sailed into this area, causing her ship to split in two, leaving Lara on her own. As a teenage girl who had never encountered such conditions in the city, it was not easy for her to find her way around and survive. But after a while, she does it (almost) on her own. After some time, he finds his friends and this is where things get a little messed up. Lara discovers that the local ""citizen"" Mathias wants to use her friend to rebirth the local queen. Which honestly... reviving the dead isn't the best thing to do. So you will try to prevent him from doing this, but your path will be full of obstacles.

[b]Great and unique Gameplay[/b]

This part has its own new elements in terms of Adventure games, the classic gameplay from the original games just wouldn't stand up. So the creators made a new one, along with elements that just fit like cogs in a machine. Apart from the fact that you have classic climbing controls, this part can appeal to you with its arsenal, not only of weapons, but also of skills. At each camp, you have the option to upgrade your weapons with whatever parts you find, or upgrade Lara's own abilities, and honestly, what's better than teaching Lara to take a handful of sand, throw it in someone's face, and then jam an Ice Ax into their knee... Ouch . You have 3 skill trees to choose from and each of them is worth something, combat, survival or just being creative with raw materials and crafting. From an ordinary Bow, you can work your way up to a Shotgun or a Submachine Gun, which you then turn into an Assault Rifle... how? I don't know, but it's divine! Long story short, this part gives you so many options to play and even more opportunities to play the game your way (Except for a few passages).

[b]So... is it worth it ?[/b]

I will not list the optimization here, if only for the reason that this game is almost 10 years old, so everyone can play it. But I have to say that this first game of the new series is my favorite and every year I return to it with enthusiasm and amazing zeal, because I know what awaits me in the game and I enjoy every playthrough of the game, it's one of the things that you you will never get bored, as this part has a lot to offer for the way it was made, and you can only benefit from it. I actually played this game for the first time when I was about 12 years old, so I have a really special bond with this game, and I hope I'm not alone. The Tomb Raider series is simply heartwarming, and anyone who has never tried it doesn't even know how much fun they're missing out on. There is hardly any episode that I didn't like from this series, and I can warmly recommend this episode and by extension the whole series, enjoy it and see you in the tomb.

[b]MY PROS AND CONS[/b]

✔ Nice graphics
✔ Well written story
✔ Unique and Inspirating Gameplay
✔ Great Optimization

This game got a lot of its inspiration from the Uncharted series, which, in turn, drank heavily from Tomb Raider itself. So, we've come full circle here.

I was never a fan of the original TR series. I understand the importance of the games, and they were certainly impressive at the time. However, tank controls, strange shooting and strangely designed dungeons kept me from having a good experience with the games, in spite of their technical feats. This reboot corrects all of these problems: controls are generally great, combat is a lot more engaging and the dungeons (or areas) are much better to navigate, while maintaining the spirit of exploration the series is known for. Even better that the story is kind of nice, and the development of Lara as the protagonist is really well done. The developers clearly tried to give a cinematic presentation for the game, but cutscenes never outstay their welcome. Puzzles are great, not really difficult to figure out, but some are challenging enough that it feels like a victory when you crack them.

There is good content in the game, with a lot of collectibles and side missions to do; however, after finishing the game, I felt very little inclined to come back and complete it. I believe they don't offer enough incentives for completionists, but I can hardly blame the game for it, as it's just a matter of opinion.

I recommend this game, but try to get it on a sale, as the game becomes dirty cheap, making it an even better deal.",1674498005,1674498005,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Installed and launch on ultimate settings. My pc can run this. I've done it before and i play Witcher 3 on the highest settings at max no issue.

Now when i launch this game its just a square white middle and black borders and sits there forever frozen and i have to shut it down it task manage to close it.

This is not anything on my end. So do not tell me to do a 3rd party fix. I am here to say why this game deserves 0 purchases and 0 support from here on out.

Fun gameplay, with a special emphasis on the bow and collecting parts - reminiscent of The Last of Us. Enemies are aggressive, constantly pressing you, often trying to flank. 

There are many different weapons to use (each of which can be upgraded) along with improvements for things like melee. What also impressed me about the game were the various set pieces, often topping those found in the Uncharted series.

A few negatives do bring the game down from GOTY contention. The story while conceptually interesting (think Uncharted 1), is littered with stereotypical characters and some uninspiring voice acting and one too many cliches - watching these cutscenes is not my idea of fun. 

Lara's 'development' into a survivor is highly unrealistic, feeling more like a switch and than an earned status. And tbh the ending was underwhelming and highly forgettable - AAA developers always to conclude things.

Overall, would recommend the game. Lots of fun, looks pretty and good value for the money.

Tomb Raider mixes survival, puzzle, loot, combat and platforming with a system of weapon, tool and skill upgrades.

I've played plenty Lara Croft games, but the early 2010s obsession with realism and gritty themes don't suit her. The series has always been about escapism -  a way to play out the camp of the 90s Bond films but with a female lead - yet all that is absent here. Naughty Dog cribbed that and made the stellar Uncharted games, while Tomb Raider 2013 decided to experiment around. Thematically I found it perplexing that the story seems intent on showing how Lara struggles with murder and survival while at the same time making her into literal death machine in the player's hands. 

Gameplay wise - it's fine. The puzzles are interesting and well-placed within the confines of its world, the combat is serviceable, there's some lite RPG mechanics to give a sense of progression. My gripes boil down to story - how it's told, what it's trying to tell. Telling, considering the later sequels to this game further alienates me from this franchise. 

In short, I simply don't enjoy this game as much as I want to and wished it was a completely different game. Which is unfair criticism towards it to be frank. I'm sure some people would be happy to play this version of Lara. Humanised, realistic, expressing reasonable human reactions towards being shipwrecked on a mythical island with eerie temples.

My fist time was on the XBOX so graphically there is a huge improvement on PC. While visuals definitely show their ages in places, especially with distant visuals, the game still looks pretty good. I'm running on an RTX 3080 and Ryzen 7 5800X, and there were a few cases of stutter and freezing later in the game, and a few places where Lara would glitch around the geometry in comical ways, but overall the game ran fairly smooth. 

Game play and controls are easy to get into, and the feeling is very similar to the Uncharted Games. While it lacks the humor and lightheartedness of Uncharted, TR is not afraid to delve into darker and more grotesque places. After wading through piles of bodies and body parts, you start wondering if Lara Croft has some serious issues, because she handles those situations too well considering this is her first adventure. Then again the acting and dialogue are just okay, so perhaps its better Square Enix did not attempt a more realistic response. There are a few cases I felt the dialogue was a little cliche and melodramatic. A lot of the characters and their motives are very obvious, yet all still remains a mystery to Lara. That might be the downside of reading through every journal in an otherwise very scripted game. 

I would say the only areas of the game that show its age in an unwelcome way are the boss fights that overly rely on cinematic and quick time events. Best example is the final boss where you get the hang of staying close, dodging, and attacking, and then everything gets bungled after missing a QTE. By the end of the game, enemies begin to feel sort of ""bullet spongy"". How many head/face shots does it take to bring an enemy down? The use of slow motion in many sequences is also somewhat unwelcome, but perhaps all that slow motion is where the game finds its humor. 

I would say TR is solid 6.5/7 out of 10. Worth playing if you need a break between longer and more intense games and or just want to get back into the series.

The game is a reboot of the popular series and it offers a fresh take on the character.

One of the things I loved about this game is the level design. Each level feels unique and offers a lot of exploration opportunities. The environments are beautifully rendered and the attention to detail is impressive. The game also features a variety of puzzles that are challenging but not impossible to solve.

The combat system is also well-done. Lara has a variety of weapons and abilities at her disposal, and the game gives players the freedom to approach combat situations in different ways. The stealth mechanics are particularly well-done, allowing players to take a more stealthy approach if they so choose.

The story is also engaging, and it keeps you hooked from start to finish. It offers a lot of twists and turns, and it explores Lara's personal growth as a character. The voice acting and motion capture are excellent, making the characters feel alive and relatable.

Overall, I would highly recommend Tomb Raider to fans of the series and newcomers alike. It's a fantastic game that offers a lot of variety in gameplay, beautiful environments, and an engaging story. It's a game that kept me hooked from start to finish, and it's one that I will definitely replay in the future.",1578252564,1674052149,True,21,2,0.657563984394073486,1,True,False,False

It's important to play this game with a controller, as the game play is not geared towards a keyboard and mouse experience at all.

It's a short game that won't take you very long to finish, but that keeps the action more densely packed. It took me 10 hours -- around 2 days of moderately heavy playing to finish (with a 69% completion rate, according to the game).

Tomb Raider remains a very playable game in 2023. The graphics are a little better on Ultimate in 4K, but are one of the game's weaknesses compared to its newer peers. The facial animations aren't as convincing as in other titles like Uncharted 4 or the Assassin's Creed games, but the voice acting and story arc are believable.

The gameplay is great, with a good number of problems/obstacles that you work out with only a few tools. You can customize your weapons as you progress, and develop different skills in the order you want. It's really a matter of what you want to prioritize, since by the end of the game, you should have nearly all the perks leveled up.  

The stealth aspect is probably one of the game's stronger suits.

DO NOT BUY! 
A badly executed update to add support for Epic Game Store (i.e. selling out to Chinese Tencent corporation money) has had the side effect of breaking the game.
The game has been broken since 2021-10-19, resulting in significant parts of the HUD being displayed offscreen.
Two subsequent updates (both for Epic Game Store issues) - last one a whole year later in Sept 2022 - have NOT addressed this issue. 
In other words: Square Enix is fuilfilling some $$$ contract to support the Epic Game Store - while blatently ignoring/breaking everything else about the game.
The only solution is to select old BETA BUILD version 743 in the Steam game properties.
If they ever purge the old beta builds, the game will become unplayable.

Not the hardest game out there in the exploration and item finding but I got hooked pretty quickly.
Combat encounters were fun as hell guns felt good. shotgun was the highlight weapon.
Near the end of the game you finally get your double pistols but i only got to use them once in the game and then the game ended i wish it could have happened earlier but i guess that's what sequels are for.
I think that would help the combat system was if there were better mechanics implemented in stealth abilities. stealth sections in the game were not by my choice as Lara's character would crouch weather i wanted to or not. If i was given the decision to play stealthy in open ended areas that would have been a great compliment to the existing combat game play.

The game does have tombs, but a lot of the gameplay revolves around Lara's origins & the survival elements like collecting scrap, killing enemies & hunting.

Story is very good, the gameplay even in 2020 still holds up.  There are some rpg elements that feels out of place, but dont worry, this is not an rpg game at all so if u dont like rpg games, u wont have a problem with this one.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~PAY ATTENTION IF YOU ARE A COMPLETIONIST GAMER~!!!!!!!!!!!

This game comes with Online mode, which means Online trophies... The online in this game was and still is DEAD and there are trophies that you need 4 PLAYERS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE EM (you can still find some people playing some times but there are 95% of the time cheaters, just flying around the map killing everybody :P ) 

So i warned you, if you are a completionist, i would suggest you not to buy this game, because it will ruin your stats and u wont be able to get the 100%. 

As you can see i have 100% this one, but i was lucky af that iv found 3 more people after almost a week of searching in the community... My friends hated it and I HATED IT! If you have people to get the trophies though, go ahead and buy it, the tasks are easy af except the lvl 60 trophy that needs grinding.

I just finished the first game (14 hours). I really enjoyed it and look forward to starting Rise of the Tomb Raider next. I really have zero complaints about it.

Other than going back to prior areas to get missing collectibles, there isnt much point (which was fine).

Last year, I found out that there was a tumor in my head and I underwent chemotherapy many times to treat the tumor.
One day I got tired of all the chemotherapy and trying to survive.
I said to myself that there is nothing in the world that I want to live for
Until one day my friend Jesse gave me this game as a gift
I wanted to not accept the game
But I accidentally accepted the game
I installed the game and played it for a few minutes and I realized that I like it and until today I have played it for more than a hundred hours

This game is an action packed thriller with explosive set-pieces and a storyline to root for. The Lara Croft we know is absent. Long gone the duel wield weaponry and the unbeatable killer machine of a women we love, instead we get a timid and frightened young lady who is stranded in a japan-ish bermuda triangle. Hunting for her life are the fanatics led by an intriguing character named Mathias who wants to resurrect the fabled Sun Queen who used to rule the world ages ago. However, Lara is not alone in her journey, she has her mentor & friend along with her best friend Sam and a group of rag tag explorers. The atmosphere is beautiful and horrific at the same time. Equally, gorgeous is the lead heroine Lara, who instead of over-sexualized in previous games, is depicted as an average explorer who when faced with the mortal dangers quickly sprangs into action. Camilla Ludington the voice of Lara has done an amazing job! The puzzles are few but very intelligent and realistic, Lara dont have to push a button to solve everything like in past, here she has to manipulate surroundings in order to solve the puzzles. This game is amazing, I have already played in 24 times. After playing its sequel (Rise of Tomb Raider) and the series finale (Shadow of Tomb Raider) I conclude that this one is by far the most superior of the trilogy. For Lara worshipper like me it was a mandatory game to play, however I would encourage every action/adventure lover out there to try this amazing masterpiece.",1671623152,1671623152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I really want to like this game, but the damn glitch made me stuck countless times, and I have to watch Lara died again and again!!!!! The devs of this game is probably a sadist or have a sick fetish that like to watch woman die and suffer.

EDIT!!!
I have finally able to finished the game with 100% completion. And I really enjoy this game when it's not broke. There's a few place this game glitched on me, [spoiler] First one is right from the start when I swinging upside down, there's no other body hanging for me to push so I can't complete the puzzle. Turns out it glitched because I was rewriting the save slot I used before to start a new game. So this is solved by starting a new game with a new save slot.
Secondly, the most annoying glitch in this game is when Lara fight with the wolf! By seeing other people play this part on YouTube, I got to know that I can't finished this part because the game didn't give me the necessary prompt! There's this one prompt that is missing that should make Lara stab the wolf. This part is really annoying because I loss count on how many times I had to watch Lara died because the prompt didn't show like it had to. I tried changing the graphic quality, changing full screen on off like someone suggested, and somehow I finally got the prompt appear, after trying a few times. [/spoiler]
There are other glitch that I don't remember because it's minor or not as annoying as those two above. Over all I like this game and my only problem is the occasional annoying glitch and the gruesome death scene of Lara. if you don't mind those, then yes I would probably recommend this game.",1670410667,1671029076,True,0,0,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,False

Everything nowadays try to go in the direction of a STRONG FEMALE character, instead of a STRONG female CHARACTER.

The gameplay is fun, but in my opinion, it's too repetitive. The game is very generous with it's ammo and you are able to upgrade your equipment, making it even more powerful. It isn't a bad thing, but it takes some of the challenge away.
The story is absolutely phenomenal, the characters are great, (fuck you Whitman) and the visuals are beautiful. But there is one thing that drags the story down, but it isn't something to do with the game itself.
""Did I ever tell you, what the definition, of insanity, is?""
Yeah, Far Cry 3 beat this game to the market by about 4 months, meaning that if someone plays this or that first, they will probably see the other as really similar, which I am experiencing right now. It's a real shame because the people involved with FC3 and TR really put their all into making a great game, only to have both games being compared to each other because of extremely similar ideas.

First of all, the world is very immersive, with the events we experience and the lore we find building an intriguing picture of the situation on the island we find ourselves in, and the events that led up to it. Character design was decent, as was voice acting, but unfortunately the dialogue writing was pretty uninspired, though luckily not terrible. The world is also designed very well - both realistic and aesthetically pleasing, with terrain variety reminescent of CoD 4. Traversing it is generally very pleasant, although climbing routes are way too obvious for my taste, with white paint marking almost anything you can use on your way.

The progression throughout the game was quite satisfying, both in terms of the available movement mechanics and in terms of combat. The available weapons and the encountered enemies both got gradually more and more advanced, in what seemed like a natural way. Combat in general is quite satisfying as well, although sadly, is way too easy. Even at the highest (3rd) difficulty level, it's trivial to headshot everyone with a bow most of the time, and it's very difficult to get killed (unless you're grinding an achievement which requires you to tackle an enemy with a rifle...). Although it's not much of a challenge, it's still quite fun, and an optimal amount of hidden locations and collectibles makes the world even more enjoyable to explore.

I mean it implies that she's a college student by the time this journey starts so it makes sense that this is shown to be a traumatic experience in Rise of the Tomb Raider. And her distress over this game, all the way til Shadow of the Tomb Raider, was really well handled.

The character gets cooler, and even scarier over the course of the events of all the games and it's so interesting and genuinely fun to watch it happen. I love being part of that.

In that sense, it is undeniable that [i][b]Uncharted™[/b][/i] (and, subsequently, its sequels) became a staple to the action-adventure genre from 2007 onward.

And so, it was almost inevitable that the [i]Tomb Raider[/i] series would take notes and inspiration from that other series, from which this reboot brilliantly resulted. Despite being much more focused in the action part of it (and recognizing its dissonance with the story, that tries to ground the violence since her first kill but ends up almost glorifying it), this game ends up offering a new Lara Croft, intentionally distant from its original iteration but, for that, much more interesting.

Although loving the character and having played the Legend Trilogy from start to finish, I'm not as defensive as some may be for the original games (which I never got around to playing). I simply adore the way they have taken this character here, inspired clearly by the [i][b]Uncharted™[/b][/i] series but never copying it. Instead, it leans on this character's distinct characteristics and personality, with a story that explores her vulnerability, hiding a clear dormant survival instinct, that would develop in the sequels. 

I've seen many point out the lack of the dual pistols as Lara Croft's signature weapon, even by the end of this new trilogy, but not only do I recognize the bow as an intentional departure from the old games, offering a new iconic weapon for the character, but its integration is ingrained in the platforming and is an added challenge to the game's combat. I found myself using that weapon for most of the time, as it helped develop my aim and take my time developing a a stealthier approach for some of the encounters.

I couldn't be more in love with this franchise than I am with this game, revitalizing the different game mechanics but, most noticeably, the main character. Lara Croft definitely became a hero of mine from this point on.",1629561670,1670420934,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

had a scaling issue where the subtitles went out of the screen but sorted by changing it to an older(?) build version. theres a thread about the fix somewhere if you encounter similar issue.
bugs do exist in this game. had a ""door stuck"" situation which can be dealt with loading the last checkpoint. small things like that, nothing concerning.

[b] minor spoilers [/b] (complaints related to characters mostly)
[spoiler] some of lara's monologues couldve been better if they were internal. she literally talks to herself while enemies are nearby. [/spoiler]
[spoiler] would be fun if friendly NPCs like jonah or sam could join you as companion. the plot even critiqued how alex shouldnt go on solo missions. i get it that it is done to display the abilities of lara, her loneliness and so on. they had a thing sort of like that with whitman(ie turning wheels to open a door) and roth (ie supporting you cross a bridge) but that was it. [/spoiler]
[spoiler] i do not know if people actually cared about sam due to the lack of interactions between her and lara other than them screaming each other's name. wouldve been nice to insert a small playable flashback scene of, for example, them travelling together, not just learning their friendship through collectable journals. they arent even trying with this queerbait.

I've not finished the game in my 8 hours, and I plan to finish it, there's just a lot of problems I have with the game. First, Lara survives an absurd amount of damage to herself. In the first 5 minutes, she slams her head twice, falls about 25 feet onto a piece of rusty rebar that impales her, and she simply PULLS IT OUT. She falls about roughly 100 times from impressive heights that look like it would hurt a lot, but she keeps going like nothing happened. Only once in the game does it address that she's been injured. I would allow it if this was uncharted, however even uncharted isn't this absurd, and at least with Drake it's plausible that he could survive everything he's been through. My second issue is that there's no humor in the game, and the game takes itself very seriously when the reaction to anyone dying is ""oh no! anyway..."" Anytime a character dies it tries to have emotion for 10 seconds afterwards then it's completely gone and it's quite jarring, combined with the fact each character has very little screen time s when they die it's impossible to care about them. There's a couple of other issues I have being the game tells you when a tomb is nearby, completely throwing away the exploration mechanic and the tombs are comically simple to complete within 5 minutes of showing up to one (and I've done 5 so far). You kill about 300 guys or so in the game and Lara doesn't really flinch or react besides the first one and it's pretty strange logic, but I can't fault it too much since every game is like that.

The game isn't all bad though. I like the story somewhat and the gun play is good, The bad guy is interesting and I like the creepy island element. it's pretty much uncharted game play with a bow involved and less guns to choose from. and that's sort of my issue. This game is a worse version of uncharted where you're chasing a treasure and something bad happens once you've found it.

TL;DR Game is a serious version of uncharted and executed somewhat poorly comparatively, Characters die and you don't have time enough with them to care. Takes itself very seriously.

As an Tomb Raider game, I highly recommend veterans and newcomers to give TR 2013 a try. It DOES feels different from the past releases, but different in a good way. 

As we all know, we had a new Lara Croft within this entry, and we get to know more about her throughout the game, including the way she deals with every misfortune put upon her. New Lara makes a good job to introduce the reboot series, having more of a female Rambo grip than any other. It's the very first time that I envision Lara as a survivor, when before she felt to me much more like an adventurer, always managing to have the upper hand by clever thinking and being very bold, where in this game she is pretty much the underdog until half of the story. 
Lara will do anything to stay alive and to keep her friends safe, I really liked that!

The whole game is very consistent from start to finish, making the whole adventure much more seamless and with less halts, even giving the player a chance to take a break and inhale some fresh air once in a while (something that Tomb Raider 3 didn't even considered to). It takes up to 16 - 18 hours to complete, and if you want to do 100%, 50 hours should be enough.

The controls here are very, very good. One thing I've always liked about Crystal Dynamics is how they manage to implement such great controls for Lara, making her feel the most swift and agile possible.

Combat here is the best it ever had been, never liked how combat worked on the previous entries and it does feel archaic, but here it is very refined and works really well. Lara cycles through 5 weapons to fight against her enemies, so in almost every fight I changed weapons in a flight, rapidly changing the pace of the fight in my favor and giving myself the advantage I needed. 

I liked the story, it is original with some few nods here and there to other titles. I like how important fundamentally interwined japanese culture is to the story, so that's a plus.

Is it different? A lot. Is it bad? Not by a chance.

This game was created by someone with completely bizarre ideas an misconceptions about what a good modern game should be like even for 2013 when it was created. 

VOMIT INDUCING CUT SCENES. Literally!  Extreme closeups and simulation of shaking handheld camera is not something you do these days. Especially in games. Those effects were popular 50 years ago when people were watching smaller tube TVs from across the room. Now everybody is either playing close to a high res. monitor or on a huge 4k TV, again, sitting close for better immersion. Most of the game Lara's figure is probably less than half of the height of the screen, but cut scenes show extreme close ups with camera shakes so much that you can barely see what is going on. Your eyes start to hurt. Cut scenes are only watchable from across the room, and even then the shaking feels excessive. 

Some devs still don't get that ""Cinematic"" does not equal ""good"". This effect is a cheap and lazy way to make an action scene seem more dynamic. It is not suppose to be used 100% OF THE TIME. Why in the world my screen shake like crazy in a scene where 2 people are calmly talking to each other.  It shakes throughout EVERY cut scene in the game regardless of what is going on there. And throughout much of the game itself, for example, when Lara smoothly slides down a rope. Why? It is a smooth action! Or on top of the antenna, again, shakes like crazy. Antennas sway side to side and it is a slow swaying action that makes you get a vertigo, not stupidly shaking of the entire screen.

Anyway dynamic scenes should be created with lots of interesting action on the screen, not with shaking the screen itself.

CONSTANTLY TAKING CONTROL OF PLAYERS POV. A good game attracts the attention of a player with interesting details, not simply rotating your screen to where the game thinks you should look. When Lara is moving it immediately turns your own view towards the direction of her movement. You cannot simply run sideways while looking forward for example. When Lara is hanging, or climbing or doing anything in particular the game rotates your view for you. It is extremely annoying and frustrating. A player should ALWAYS be in full control of his camera, otherwise it feels nauseating and annoying as if you are not in control of your own head and someone physically takes it and turns it towards something they think you should look at. Such a dumb way to kill immersion.

Those are the main topics that made this otherwise good game annoying and unplayable and I'm deleting it unfinished. It is simply not enjoyable. I played the later Tomb Raider and It had the same things, but not as excessive as here.  Times are changing, new techniques and devices are developing, old school cinematic and tricks no longer work and I'm not likely to buy anything else from a studio that does not get it.",1669280536,1669283658,False,0,0,0.456431567668914795,0,True,False,False

The story is intriguing, characters and voice acting compelling. The gameplay is also very fun, with both combat and exploration enjoyable.

My first major complaint is with regards to difficulty. I am playing on hard difficulty and apart from a couple fights within the first hour or so of the game, combat is quite easy. Fights do take some strategy, and the stealth aspect of the bow is quite interesting, but I haven't had to reload due to dying in combat since the (very well designed) encounter where you fight while escaping a burning building that occurs very early on. Ammunition is also far to abundant, in fact I rarely find myself without full ammo for every weapon. This completely eliminates resource management and makes the ammo finding skills fairly useless. Nevertheless, since the game mainly focuses on story and exploration, I don't find the difficulty aspect detracts from my experience very much.

There are also issues with story immersion due to the fact that several tombs and other side quests pop up during very tense moments of the story. For example, as Lara is attempting to rescue a pilot who parachuted from a burning plane before he is captured by the cultists, she finds a tomb and is given the option to explore this. Since it is time consuming to backtrack, I often find myself wandering around during tense story moments to grab some equipment or discover relics.

All in all, quite an enjoyable game: 8/10

Edit: Having completed the game I will say that things do get more difficult once again towards the end, and ammunition eventually does become somewhat of a resource to manage. On a negative note combat becomes somewhat repetitive without many new types of enemies to overcome. Instant reloads without penalty eventually took away the sense of fear that I had while exploring early on in the game and contributed to my building feeling of boredom as my playtime passed 10 hours. Rating remains the same, worth it for the voice acting, visuals design of the island, and the atmosphere created in at least the first half of the game.",1599563996,1669026494,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing this game without worrying about finding every little nook and cranny that eventually makes you bored (at least it makes me bored), so you can be a ""completionist"" (wonder why anyone would care about that)  was my approach. Enjoying the world, the story, the gameplay, even with all the flaws, was a time well spend.

Graphics in highest settings hold pretty well for such an old game, the world looks amazing, the story is interesting and you get enough tense moments for a tomb raider game. Combat is ok, but again, this a tomb raider, it is more about the story, the puzzles (not hard ones), and the jumping, climbing, sliding around.

Nothing is realistic. Flammable objects burn down in seconds, animals have terrible AI, and the landscapes all have the same obvious signposting for jumping, climbing and grappling. This isolated island is absolutely filled with skeletons, still-lit lamps, and wreckage. Many of the baddies have bows, for some bizarre reason, and ammunition litters the map in a quite preposterous abundance. Curious string bags can be found regularly and they must be set on fire in order to get the ‘salvage’ from within. Why these bags couldn’t just be opened with our Lara-hands is beyond me.

‘Salvage’ is a form of currency used to, somehow, upgrade your weaponry and it can also be found in random crates and, um, in animals. Yes folks, that means you can innocent deer and use the body parts to make a better receiver for your automatic rifle. How? Don’t know.

The game is over engineered in many parts. The shaky camerawork is unrelentingly present, even in cut-scenes and there is simply too much freaking weather on some maps. The camp menu, which you’ll be using a lot, throws pointlessly exaggerated animations and sound effects at you every time you navigate through it, and I hated it. This menu is where you spend your experience to choose new skills and where you spend your salvage to upgrade your weaponry, and there aren’t many options in it but every damn one of them requires several grades of navigation. Please just show me all the skills on one page and all the weapon upgrades on another without the special effects and flashes and booms and swooshes and beeps—it’s like Michael Bay directed the flipping thing.

Strangely, I have seen other reviewers praise the characterisation and the story but I warn against believing them: Lara has no arc at all, starting out as a tough cookie who says she hasn’t a clue but then adventures away with ease; and ending as a tough cookie who, well, adventured away with ease. It’s all tell with opposite show. The story, too, is pretty silly (the big, bad cult leader wants a woman to sacrifice in order to revive a goddess, the protagonist fights through endless lesser baddies to save the woman who we barely know) and it is entirely superfluous with minor, pointless exposition happening through books you can find on the map. None of this really matters, none of it affects the gameplay, and we don’t care enough about the lesser characters to feel any bond to them. Lara could have shot the antagonist many times but the game decided, for no reason, that his death must be saved for the final (disappointingly easy) showdown. Only someone that thinks action flicks are deep or who skips the cut-scenes in RDR2 or The Last of Us could admire the writing in Tomb Raider.

But there are positives: it is a decent game with graphics that still look good in 2022 and the weaponry is fun to use. One thing that I really appreciated was Lara Croft’s appearance. While she is still an attractive representation of the traditionally female form, she is no longer overtly sexually portrayed and there are menu options to have her clothed in more practical attire than the skimpy vest she begins with. She is well acted too, with some genuinely memorable lines.

If you want some mindless fun then get the game; if you want a cerebral or powerful gaming experience then look elsewhere.",1668516619,1668516619,True,17,0,0.641595900058746338,0,True,False,False

It's fun to explore and was nice to see 100% being quite achievable (and the game makes it easy to go back and complete things you miss).

However, I encountered at least 3 game breaking bugs (one of which forced me to restart about 11 hours in since I wasn't saving multiple slots). In No Man Left Behind the crate you need to jump on can get embedded in the wall, in the Gondala section when you have to do rope jumping motion stops completely in the slow-mo not allowing you to jump and in Cliffside Bunker a door which needs to open fully does not. All of these bugs stop you from proceeding.

It seems they were due to running at 144Hz, 1440p with no VSync (using G-Sync in my case). I got past all of those issues (after restarting the came from the first one and then saving a *lot* more) by dropping to 60Hz and enabling double buffering temporarily for those sections.

While I would recommend this game, it would honestly depend on your taste of gameplay and story.
Simple story, easy to grasp gameplay mechanics and plain old fun game to go through.

The story was just okay, but I'm not out here expecting some high grade storytelling, I just thought the plot and how it paced was really mediocre. How it played out became repetitive. [spoiler] It was just going somewhere for something, you get that something but for a cost. So now you need to go to another place to get something. Repeat. [/spoiler]

BTW, there is no post-game story here. Which disappointed me a bit. The post-content is basically for completionists and collecting stuff to get that juicy 100%. What's the point of me maxing my gear and skills anymore besides getting the achievement.

The combat was really simple, to the point where it felt like it needed more variety. Like the pacing of the plot, the fighting gets stale and boring. Sometimes I felt like I'm slogging through these fights to finish the story already.

Platforming and mini-puzzles were enjoyable, I'm a fan of those things (this is tomb raider after all), [strike] although this game sometimes have wonky parkour [/strike] [spoiler] Tangent: The secret tomb with the buoy was so fucking annoying because of how you need to tediously crank on every attempt. [/spoiler]

But despite its flaws, I still enjoyed playing it. What's important to me is the feeling that I didn't waste any time playing this game.",1668175972,1668176402,True,1,0,0.507918596267700195,0,True,False,False

This was my first Tomb Raider game so I didn't necessarily know what to expect but ended up quite liking it. At this point this game is somewhat nostalgic to me almost, all of them are genuinely good, unique games, and aside from I'm guessing the cost they also take up much less space up than Uncharted lol. Speaking of Uncharted, although I also really like Uncharted, I actually personally would say I would pick any in this trilogy over those games, now to be fair especially at this point they aren't that similar, with TR focusing on survival and brutal combat, and Uncharted on... whatever Uncharted does (storytelling and side characters for sure at least). In terms of gameplay variation and design and having an open-world (at least sorta) kinda are what gives this a slight edge over that for me personally, maybe also the unnecessarily brutal death scenes here also too though both have pretty decent cinematic storytelling, there are crazy setpieces and just things going wrong everywhere and having horrible luck.

First of all, I did enjoy the metroidvania style gameplay that this reboot brought for the Tomb Raider franchise, as it feels fresh amongst the once linear, level-by-level design of it's predecessors. My only criticism of TR2013's gameplay is the out of place crafting system, specifically upgrades to your weapons and tools which feels less rewarding than simply having Lara finding those upgrades herself by raiding tombs.

Despite good, non-linear design, the game feels dragged down by it's unremarkable story and forgettable characters, including the Lara Croft herself. As nearly a decade has gone by, the reboot era of Tomb Raider has been growing less appealing as I've been realising how much reboot Lara is boring, weak, and lacking of meaningful and memorable personality, which since has gravitated me back towards the stronger, confident, elegant, and more mature version of Lara from her earlier adventures. I understand TR2013 serves as a new origin story for Lara, but the way TR2013 portrays her is almost like a completely different person with none-to-barely any of her older characterisation being intact or reformed by the end of the game.

There is a decent experience to be played here, but it's story has grown more mediocre and unmemorable as time has passed. My only wish for the future of Tomb Raider is to see a return to form, or a modern port of the original CORE era games.",1667630378,1667630378,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing this at 14 was so significant for me. Like many young gamers I too had a  really hard spot on my crotch for this game. Her grunts, screams and moans definitely awakened something in me.

Tomb Raider 2013 feels like AAA polished perfection IMO. There's zero fat on the game. Nothing feels extra, tedious or out of place. Incredible visuals for the day and they hold up just fine. The high resolution textures, shadows, tessellation and hair physics? Icing on the cake.

The reason I liked this game way more than the sequels is that it's the story of how Lara becomes a badass. 

It was the speed of her transition from ingénue to stone-cold killer that really got me! It's been a while since I played it, but I'm sure I remember a scene towards the beginning where she really gingerly and uncomfortably picks up a gun that someone dropped, and then a few scenes later she's John Wick, leaving piles of bodies everywhere she goes.

Additionally one of my favorite things about the game was the metroidvania nature to it, and  how you slowly developed your arsenal and used it to complete the myriad of challenges tucked away.

That said, the scale of mass murder, the lack of tombs, the amount of times she falls and the way she falls (honestly it’s almost injury porn), do drag the experience down a little. I mean, do we really need to see Lara with a large spike through her head, futilely trying to unimpale herself only to finally give in to death? Yeah, no thanks. 

Finally, I really liked the way the game actually progressed through a bunch of genres, taking bits and pieces from each but never over staying its welcome.  Too many games are afraid to try anything different.

Honestly now that I’m 49, I really just like linear games at this point. I’ve long since ODed on Ubisoft worlds, so a game like this continues to feel like a breath of fresh air.

This is basically like playing through a movie.

Far too many cut scenes where they want you to mash a button for Lara to do something. Riding down rapids where you can't see where you're going and if you run into an obstacle the same death scene keeps repeating. It's extremely annoying and boring. What's the point? If you're off by a second because your hand isn't in the right position on the keyboard, you die, then you have to go through the sequence again and again until you hit every button at exactly the right time. It's dumb; it's annoying; it's frustrating, and it's not fun.

The game will also have you going back through different sections, just to collect various random objects. Some add a bit to the story or background of the island, while others are pointless, and just challenges to fulfill.

I at least kind of enjoy the weapon upgrades, which may have you going through various parts of the island again to collect scraps you may have missed.

The majority of the game is small sequences where you fight a collection of enemies, and you try continuously from the last auto-save. It makes it feel less like a game than a movie where you just have to advance the plot to the next point.

It also feels very one track. You can't explore much, except what is on the track, and specific hidden spots for secrets and salvage to upgrade your weapons.

It feels less like a game than a challenge to complete the story and collect all the knickknacks from the island.

Your character doesn't even seem to stay hurt. It's like she's an immortal death god.

The story is interesting. But do not expect really strong drama, incredible plot twists, etc. The game is atmospheric. There is a variety of locations, despite the fact that the action takes place on the same island. The music is emotional, due to which you feel all the events and experiences more strongly.
The gameplay is simple and varied. Here you will kill opponents (a huge number of ways are provided), and solve riddles (how to get somewhere). Parkour is also included. To not let you get bored there are moments where you need to do a series of actions in response to the reaction ( to escape from the collapse, dodge the debris, etc.).Collecting items, experience points and spare parts is not intrusive.

Year of writing (2022)

I've never really cared much about Tomb Raider games as I wasn't a Play Station household, so I'm coming at this from a fresh unbiased direction. I like to think that I can appreciate or dislike the game without nostalgia clouding my judgment, especially since this is the kind of reboot that is trying to take the content in a different direction. However, I don't think this did the game any favors. I'm going to start with some of the things I liked about it.

The game is really well paced, and thankfully short. It never punished the player for failing stealth, and combat is competent, though I think it was balanced for people using controllers. Even so, the default PC controls are pretty good. I never felt like I needed to change them and they were intuitive enough to use without thinking about them. Visually it was smooth, though I had issues in windowed mode as it tanked frame rate and stuttered while the GPU never even went above 20% load. Lara's face looks weird but all other visuals were really good for 2013. Gameplay wasn't over complicated and worked relatively well.
But ultimately I disliked the game. While this garnish of good qualities is nice, the meat of this game (or cauliflower for you vegetarians) is pretty awful.

Camera
There's so much camera shake. It's absurd. There's more camera shake here than Ocean's 12 and will make you borderline nauseous. Apparently this gets some attention in the sequels when they patched in a way to turn it off, but that's not available here. On top of that, this game was made with either no experience of gaming on PC or no consideration for it. The auto centering third person camera is so aggressive that you can only look at things if you're standing completely still. This includes situations like stealthing around enemies where peripheral vision is much more important.

Bad Direction
It's rare for me to notice direction as a factor in how good or bad a game is because it encompasses too many things. But in this case a lot of what's wrong is on a macro level instead of being in the details. The first most obvious issue with direction is that it feels like it's plagiarizing from other popular games. Little pieces of Far Cry 3, ideas from Uncharted, but not enough from Tomb Raider. The decision to make Lara a character that the ""player wants to protect"" was terrible, leading to all kinds of bad writing and some of the most obnoxious sound elements I've ever encountered.
The set pieces are too much. It becomes abundantly clear that Lara only survives based on extraordinary luck. So many times you will engage a set piece, even without being forced to jump in by gunfire, without a way to get all the way through. As in damage to the environment during had to happen before you could actually progress. On top of that, a surprising number of them were obvious. You can see the pieces in place before it even happened. This predictability makes it hard to stay immersed and makes you think about the tools you have available and wonder why you don't approach things from different directions.
The realistic approach makes the supernatural elements seem out of place or shoe horned in. You just don't get enough exposure to this sticking point until later in the game. I'm not sure if this is a problem for other people but for me it felt like I was in two different pieces of fiction. I felt like I needed more incentive to question whether or not the Sun Goddess was real or not. Instead we're left with only two small cut scenes where no one in their right mind would have flown through in the first place, and one slightly more convincing scene of dramatic wind shift. That's it. Everything else is in realism town until you're fighting zombie samurai at the end. Yeah, that sounds even dumber now that I'm writing it than when I was doing it.

Character
Lara being the worst archaeologist in the world doesn't bother me as much as other people. There's a little joke hidden with the horse figurine that I enjoyed a great chuckle at. But her character writing and voice acting just don't line up with her actions. Instead of being realistic and relatable, she comes across as the the side character in a B movie from SyFy you hope dies by the end but doesn't. She starts off generic, over dramatizes in the cut scenes, never seems to show an ability to critically think or put together the obvious clues. She also has a persistent jarring naivete that completely disconnects from her body count. I actually don't mind that she says, ""You can do this,"" so many times, but her breathing always sounds like she's mid sob. So running around is like enjoying a whiny companion you can't get away from. The tone in her voice never changes either, despite what the character has been through; which always make her (and any character in any game) sound silly when they try to swear by calling enemies ""bastard!"" It just doesn't have the emotional weight of fighting someone who killed people close to you, or real horror of having killed so many more of them to survive or for revenge. She always sounds like someone on safari or a vacation, a tourist in her own story. Basically the opposite of the gritty intent of changing her character.

Bad Writing
I don't mind linear writing. You're not really playing the main character as much as you're along for _her_ ride. And this being a Square game, I gave it quite a bit of leeway to be grandiose and silly. But the constant stupid decision making, cliche character development, and quite often mediocre voice acting really rubbed me the wrong way. One of the first things to happen in the game is that Lara gets a piece of rebar punched all the way through her. Instead of inspecting it for potential bleeding, she immediately pulls it out and never in the entire game bandages it. She also immediately wades through dirty water with the wound.
The obvious character who will betray you is obvious. The narrative is full of cliches like, ""I'd finally set out to make my mark; to find adventure. But instead adventure found me."" Which isn't even true. She went to the island, the island didn't go to her. Even in 2013 we'd seen it all before.

Minor Gripes
The placement of things that ropes attach to almost always causes you to make a small leap of faith that the game mechanic will register. Just back these up from the edge by a yard, give us some space to be under the rope.
The physics that would be involved in arrowing something than pulling is obviously going to be dramatically different from what's presented in the game. This breaks immersion every time.
Everyone is constantly yelling and calling out to each other. It's a wonder there's any stealth in this game at all.

So if I were to put this on a scale of how many drinks at a bar is it worth, a single over priced domestic. It's done enough competently that I would say don't pay money for it, but there's so much bad about it that makes it hard to justify value. Part of the problem there is that it's bad, not wrong. Wrong things you can be patch out, but bad things are in there intentionally forever.

Finally understood how a certain program frowned upon (for a good reason) is used.
Took me months to figure out. Now, i used it to clean DLC stuff in date of 10/10/2022 because f*** mandatory; uninspired; repetitive multiplayer in single player games.
Uninstalled that program now and won't make the mistake a game that has that type of stuff in anymore (trust me or not, i'll make sure of that).

I started the reboot series by playing Rise of The Tomb Raider. I then beat Shadow. I enjoyed the other games so much I decided to loop back and play the first in the series. It's a tad dated (most notably the menu/leveling systems, etc.) but it's still a [b]really[/b] good game and an absolute must if you're a fan of the series. The graphics still look really pretty (one of those games that was ahead of its' time like The Witcher 2). I think the tone is a bit more ""horror survival"" than the other two games which I appreciated.

It was slightly cliche but I really enjoyed watching Lara transform from being kind of a wimp (in the intro she whines into her radio ""can you come get me?"") to a battle-hardened bonafide badass by the end. As the game progresses, her character model picks up more and more scars. She goes from being sick at her first kill (which she barely manages to pull off) to being a cold-blooded assassin, wherein you can choose perks that reward you with extra skill for dispatching opponents with flair (stabbing them at close range with an arrow while they are stunned, etc.).

The enemies aren't that varied and I wish there were actual boss fights but the combat (which borrows heavily from uncharted) is still satisfying. Collecting headshot after headshot with your bow will basically never get old. The plot isn't amazing but it's entertaining and above average for a video game.

Tomb Raider 2013 is essentially the origin story of Lara Croft. So be prepared to play as a wimpy college girl for a bit. That shocked a lot of people and caused some backlash, since we know Lara Croft as this badass, tough-as-nails raider. Tomb Raider 2013 for me feels a bit Call-Of-Duty-esque: You have a lot of shootouts with human enemies and there is action scenes that are really pushing my suspension of disbelief to its maximum! However, it is still very fun to play through and tells a story that adds (yet contradicts) to the incredibly complex (and already contradictory) Lara Croft Lore. So whether you're a die-hard TR fan or a newcomer to the series, it is an enjoyable game.

Only downside to it is that there's multiplayer achievements.. for a multiplayer mode really nobody wanted or needed. If you're an achievement hunter.. buy the game twice. Once for you and once for your best friend who will help you grind these achievements, there won't be anyone else playing..",1665156431,1665156431,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Youtube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing . I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories.

Really excellent game elements that were wasted on an extremely stupid, rushed game. Rise & Shadow of the Tomb Raider are basically FAR better versions of this game. There's no reason to play this one unless you're a completionst (which I kinda am, ha). Still very fun, but the weakest in the new TR series.

	pros:
- young lara is a cool character, even if she doesn't do as much in this first reboot game.
- awesome weapons, good action
- fun RPG style upgrade / XP system
- neat historical tie-ins with lore
- mostly good environments / puzzle environments (more linear than the old TR games)
- excellent sound design! immersive
- great graphics even if they've aged in a decade

	cons:
- feels unfinished
- badly ported console UI
- the bushes will kill you and eat you
- early 2010s syndrome: never too sure if playing or in a cutscene, character animations take away control at random times, and large parts of the game make no sense at all.
- some environments are extremely nonsensical, ugly mazes. (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2868692782)
- characters come and go, sometimes literally with no introduction or explanation as to why they're in the game. just... you know... a bunch of stuff that happens.
- broken third person physics makes certain levels near unplayable (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2871838199)

 because this game is very good indeed, nice history, nice graphics even for now in 2018,
nice combat, and the  visual is stunning, you can use pistol, ak47, and other weapons such 
the classic bow and arrow :D and you can upgrades all these guns, you can improve Lara's skills
well totally worth it you give it a try! i loved this one as much i loved rise of the tomb raider 
 now it's on sale on steam so if you don't have it! spent few dollars and buy it!i can assure you!
you'll spend at least 18 hours of pure fun mates :D

The game in itself is great. Just focus on the main story and (optionally) the secret tombs. I would not worry about collectibles that's just classic BS used to artificially inflate the play time (which is not needed anyways).

Just finished the game and I enjoyed it. It's a entertaining story and the brutality can be surprising sometimes lol. It did bug out a couple of times, but the autosave is so frequent that respawning or alt f4ing really isn't a major.

(1) Very Short(yet perpetually repeating the same premise) Story Line, I was able to beat the Single Player campaign in 10 hours with 80% of the items found. Note: Prerequisite, I have played every single TR release, and this scores second besides Unfinished Business in being the shortest Single Player campaign I have ever played.

(2) Deviates from the traditional puzzle solving mechanic's presented to us from the previous Tomb Raider franchise. Thanks to the survival instinct feature ""puzzles""(dare I even call them that), are pretty much a walk in the park.

(3) QTE(aka quick time events), due to these additional gameplay mechanic's the overall game feels more like Uncharted with simply a female protaganst.

(4) Grindfest - Nothing but killing hoards of enemies, lather, rise, repeat till you eventually reach the next area.  Warning: The ending will leave you thinking:  ""Wth, thats it?""

Finally, overall the game is fantastic on it's shear graphical prowess alone, but due steams not so wonderful rating system being limited to a simple yeah or nay.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game if you expect the similar gameplay offered by previous Tomb Raider games.

It was Square Enix response to Uncharted as a way to try and generate revenue through their newly acquired Western studios such as Crystal Dynamics. The product was one of the most expensive games ever made. While the reimagined Tombraider trilogy never met Square Enix financial expectations, it was enough for them to continue making titles. 

Tombraider plays similarly to Uncharted but with more content. There is a multiplayer mode that was pretty much dead on arrival so do not bother trying to play it. Unlike Uncharted their are optional ""Tombs"" to raid that offer a puzzle for Lara to solve for extra XP and salvage, they are a relatively fun distraction with nice set pieces. The shooting gameplay is pretty much your standard fair third person shooter but with the ability to upgrade your weapons as well as having more options to traverse the environment vertically than others. Unlike other games, Tomb Raider decided to go with a sticky cover mechanic instead of toggle, it is not janky like some other attempts at it and never got in the way or led to frustrating deaths or inability to traverse the environment. 

One thing to not in the game is that Lara goes through absolute hell in the game with extremely brutal death scenes and set pieces where she is thrown around like a rag doll while screaming. It is pretty gratuitous and took me out of the moment especially because it happens so frequently. It is like they played through Uncharted and saw the crazy set pieces that Drake went through and decided to make Lara go through even worse as a quantity over quality approach. 

The games story is alright with an interesting setting of Yamatai and Queen Himiko that does not really have a presence in Western media. It felt a little derivative at times but it was still enjoyable all the way through outside of Lara getting so many innocent people killed and not really feeling that bad about it. 

TLDR, Tomb Raider is a great reboot to the franchise and its gameplay stands out enough from Uncharted to become its own thing with its optional tomb puzzles, collectibles, and skill/weapon upgrade mechanics to be a fun time sink.",1663088966,1663088966,True,10,0,0.616279065608978271,0,True,False,False

Very annoying camerashake everyhwere, ofc no option to turn it off
Alt-tab often crashes the game - jea multitasking is something totaly new rofl

Basic colour tone of the game is way to grey - why? No clue because this is VERY easy to fix. Thanks Reshade!

Most importantly, imo this is not a game, theres so many situations where the devs want u to do something EXACTLY like they intended to do it, if u dont do that - bam ur dead - retry.

It doesn't have an atmosphere of being one on one with ancient tombs where you have to navigate through complex enviroments and solve puzzles. It packed with constant action and gunfights without compinsating it with enough platforming or puzzle solving.

We had this original 3D planformer (something that almost no one ever nailed before). Then came Uncharted, took a lot of inspiration from Tomb Raider and established itself as another game series. Then Tomb Rider forgot what it suppose to be good at and tried to simply copy its rival - the Uncharted while losing all of its originality that made it into amazing game to begin with. That irony could of not be any heavier. A franchise that drestroyed itself as an original series while trying to mimic its rival that actually took an inspiration from it.

----- The original review -----

... this game is so... weird.

Whenever I play this game I find myself on a roller-coaster of emotions.
One moment I'm captivated and the next I'm cringing.
I never really know if I'm enjoying myself or left wanting to quit and never touch this game ever again.

The game-play...Well there is a lot more gun-play this time around... but I do find it to be fun and exciting enough... usually.
There is down-time here and there as you wonder through the level. Fun sights to see and moments of Player VS Environment but the experience is crippled by quick-time events. Also bad is that at currently 30% completion the levels have so far been extremely linear compared to the original with a quaint environmental puzzle to solve here and there. Most of the ""substance"" has really been in the flash of the visually beautiful level aesthetics, graphics, and the intensity of the action... and unfortunately the action requires a cringy level of suspension-of-disbelief.

Some of the things that really make me cringe about this game:
- Obsessive use of violence and gore which comes off as out-of-place; there are scenes that made me feel I was playing Resident Evil 5 FFS... The violence towards Lara is also depicted in fairly explicit detail as we see her die by getting crushed by boulders and shot in the face... Sure those things happened in the original game... but here it is so gritty, in-your-face, and bluntly depicted... it can be very off putting and just isn't and aspect that I would have focused on if in charge of rebooting the series. We even get to hear Lara admit that killing is easier than she thought it would be... ok miss edge lord... Like, don't get me wrong, I play Postal... It's just a game...  but I mean... did we really need this in Tomb Raider?
- The dialogue is... I don't even care... I've heard Lara say ""why?"" so many freaking times times it's burned into my brain... and the writing goes in an absolute loop; the story is constantly repeating itself with every new cut-scene and really helps to remind one that time is a flat circle... I skip all the cut-scenes, dialogue, everything... I know the absolute basics of the story and that really is enough...  Seriously listing to these characters is like nails on a chalkboard. 
- The upgrade system for abilities and weapons feels... meh, underwhelming and pointless.
- And almost every scene in this game Lara is surviving some outlandish and complete unbelievable scenario like a comic-book hero.

I just don't know how I feel about this game, I just don't get what's so ""overwhelmingly positive"" about it.
At 30% completion, I've found this game is just average, heightened by beautiful environments to gawk at and action with a style of intensity that works in the moments when it's working until the game asks you to believe Lara would survive falling 20 stories... 5 times in a row with-in 30 seconds... after falling through burning buildings that are also falling... while having arrows and molotovs hurled at you.",1625451826,1662398505,False,1,0,0.520743906497955322,0,True,False,False

I have only played the Tomb Raider Crystal Dynamics trilogy, and this is the point of view I'm looking from when reviewing this game.

 Tomb Raider is a game that greatly differs from its predecessors. It is a lot more action focused, trying to draw the player in as if we were watching an action movie. And as it is common with action flicks, it is totally unrealistic and there is an explosion every five seconds. Lara has a solution for every problem, she is far superior to other characters in every way and she can tumble down, get stabbed, get shot and run seemingly forever like she's a superhero. She alone, armed with a bow and a tank top, can defeat an entire army of savage angry men with assault rifles and dynamite sticks. Over and over.

 Previous Tomb Raider games focused on adventure, many of the enemies being wild animals, traps and the environment itself. What invited people in was the wonder of exploration, ancient tombs and seeing a witty Lara Croft know her way around uncharted territory. This game tries to show us a young and innocent Lara, before she became THE Tomb Raider. Unfortunately, it mostly fails on this. Lara is very one dimensional, she's your typical hollywood movie survivor fighting bad guys.

 The rest of the characters are a million times worse. The Endurance crew is devoid of any personality, they're common archetype characters that you even forget exist throughout the game. The same can be said about the main villain, which is (and I'm sorry for repeating myself!) an archetype character. I honestly did not care for anyone in this game except for Lara. None of these characters develop whatsoever, and the little you learn about them is through documents scattered throughout the island, which leaves you uninterested. You can see right away what type of characters they will be, and what their intentions are. 

 The dialogue is also lacking. Lara is constantly shouting ""SAM!"" trying to make us care about her endangered best friend, yet we know nothing about their friendship so we could care less. Everything is very predictable and boring, your typical ""I promise"" for dramatic effect.

 Despite this, the game is in fact [b] entertaining [/b] and I had fun watching the story unfold (it is simply extremely cliché).

 Regarding the gameplay, it is pretty good. There are many areas which you can explore, a big map you can access, and different challenges and collectibles in each area (the tombs are terrible though, they're very small and require no intellectual effort at all to get through, which was disappointing). And speaking of ""intellectual effort"", there are barely any puzzles in this game, less than in Uncharted and every other TR game. And the ones that do exist can barely be considered head scratchers.

 The combat is very good, there are four weapons to which you need to find parts to upgrade (and there are lots of upgrades), you can have fire arrows, silencers, grenade launchers, rope arrows etc. There's also a bit of melee combat that even has a dodge + counter skill you can learn.

 Finally, in terms of graphics and visuals, the game looks alright for a 2013 release. It is not perfect, but the lighting is good enough that you get some really cool sceneries.

 I know I was a bit harsh in this review, but all in all I recommend this game as it is simple and fun and you can never have too much Lara Croft.",1604011905,1662067314,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

No longer did she have to serve as a sex goddess with only boobs shaking. Gamers had to be able to empathize with the suffering Lara endured. Because she is more than just that sexy woman. That immediately explains the transformation that Lara has undergone; she looks slightly different from the previous parts. more humane.

Our archaeologist is 21 years old and together with a few other people on a ship en route to Japan. In the land of the rising sun, there is a lot of art to discover. True treasures. Every archaeologist's wet dream. But before Lara gets there, she is shipwrecked and not every person on the way seems to be equally nice. Logically, otherwise the story doesn't have a leg to stand on.

One of the most powerful features of Tomb Raider is its cinematic aspect. Right from the start when Lara gets into trouble at sea, you'll be on the edge of your seat right away. 
The adrenaline rushes through your body, because Lara has to flee for her life. The music has nerve-racking sounds and at the right moment you have to perform some quick-time events, because otherwise you become one with the boulders in the depth. That beginning of that game - that first hour - is really sensational.

However: it gets to the point where there is so much non-stop explosive action in this game that it makes a Michael Bay produced movie almost seem like a French art house movie with lots of conversations instead of explosions.

It seems like the developers wanted Lara Croft to have a near death experience every couple of seconds and frankly that wears out quickly.

Humor is also completely absent in this game.
That doesn't take away from the fact that Tomb Raider is a fantastic game with very smooth controls. 

Although you sometimes get the feeling that the 'Uncharted' formula has been copied (despite the fact that Tomb Raider has been around for much longer!) and it is all not very original, it should be noted that Tomb Raider is addictive. 
This is partly due to that butter smooth control. Every jump hits the spot, every move feels natural and every arrow or bullet hits its target.

Mechanically the game plays brilliant although it may be on the easy side for experienced gamers (only the end boss is difficult but I did get past him in the end, after multiple tries).

After about a third of the game, the number of shootouts increases massively compared to the first part of the game. There are simply way too many.

There is a serious balance issue with this game imho. There is far too much non stop action with hardly any points in the game where you can relax a moment and come to a rest. This is in particular so for the second half of the game. 

They adressed this issue with 'Rise of the Tomb Raider' but that still had a lot of action but more puzzles & exploration but they only fixed it in the third part, Shadow of the Tomb Raider.
In a way that's fine because it does give each game a different feel with the most action packed game first and the least one (and imho best one) last.

In any case it's a fantastic way to reboot a series, a breath of fresh air.

Lara and her friends get shipwrecked on an ancient island full of mystery. The crew soon encounters the island's cult inhabitants called the Solarii. Some of the crew members are killed and Lara is separated from the others. She has little choice but to fight to survive.

Positives:
+ The story: Engaging and has great pacing.
+ The setting: Yamatai is both gorgeous and deadly.
+ Good graphics.
+ Experience system: Unlock skills in three categores (survivor, hunter, and brawler) as you level up.
+ Combat: Use either a bow, pistol, shotgun or a rifle. It's really fun and tense especially when you're against multiple bad guys.
+ Great stealth and cover mechanics: It's fun silently picking off badguys with your bow.
+ You really feel the tension in some scenes.

Negatives:
- You can walk off damage during and after combat.
- Besides Lara, there's little character development: Most of the character development comes from documents you find scattered throughout the island.
- Too many quick time events: Even the final battle is a QTE!
- Ending is too short.

There are some parts of Tomb Raider I enjoyed. I love the combat and weapons segments, climbing and jumping mechanics, and the tomb discoveries. The puzzles are okay, but they don't always make sense from an engineering perspective. However, the scenes where Lara is sliding, falling, struggling, kicking, or being carried down a river are enraging to the point of ruining the game for me. All those segments have steep learning curves and exact timing, so Lara is going to die over and over before you find out exactly how to navigate out of those (extremely difficult) segments. Her deaths are so grisly, vocal, and awful that it's like watching a snuff film. I watched a wolf rip her throat out like 15 times. I've watched cult members cut her throat over and over. I've watched her fall through a disintegrating bridge into the chasm below 14 times. I've watched her impaled in the river scene on Mountain Descent a good 25 times already. Not only can I not make it past this part, but I've just decided it's no fun anymore.   

You would have to be a sadist, a psychopath or a misogynist to enjoy this game, and I am none of those things. Navigating high speed or perilous situations in the game should not be this difficult. I can't believe they haven't fixed what are some obvious mechanical problems with Tomb Raider. It deserves better.  I've never died this many times in any game and each death is over the top gruesome. 

Bitterly disappointed that I won't be able to complete this, but I wanted a fun action-adventure game, and this has become more frustrating than fun. The character suffers too much and dies too often for the game to be enjoyable.

When the Tomb Raider Reboot came out in 2013, I was stunned. Loved this new realistic Lara, the fact that they drop the dumb dual welding pistols, and she now grabbed the gun like a pro, was it for me. Her body and clothing are more believable now for a female adventurer, I never really get mixing sex and video games, but that formula clearly worked for quite some time. This new Lara is fantastic, you get attached to her walking her journey. This 1st entry is all about ""a survivor is born"" so is a painful journey filled with hardships and difficult emotional moments. But in the end, we see the Tomb Raider emerge from that.

The original PC version released in 2013 is way better that the console definitive edition they released years later. Since the game was released, I completed it several times, and it's always been an exciting adventure to get into Lara's shoes. Love the stealth gameplay, the enemy pre-combat dialogs, the enemy AI is great, and the weapons! Total masterpiece and a great franchise reboot.",1660567016,1660567016,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I don't think it aged well graphically, it's muted brown environments just look ugly. Mechanically, it's a third person shooter with semi-openworld, fairly standard but gets the job done. I wasn't a fan of all the rope puzzles, they are quite repetetive. 

Plotwise, it's a generic video game story. It has this common problem regarding Lara, whose character development seems to be the focus, she goes from blank slate to a Rambo-style killing machine mowing down dozens and hundreds of foes without much of batting an eye real quick.

Don't know if this is a pc thing but the camera angles made it hard for me to see whether a leap below Lara was safe to drop down from and when I hid I sometimes got things like the wall or leaf blocking my view of the enemies I was aiming at, but again, maybe that is just a pc thing. Hated those experiences but overall Tomb Raider is awesome, so much action, it gives you open room to explore the island and do whatever you want basically. It gets tricky all the time but that's the charm of Tomb Raider games ^^ Also adore Lara's new design! 

This game is not for the faint hearted, there are scenes of cannbalism involved as well as disfigured body parts, blood, tortures and extremely heavy displays of blood and gore, killing animals cursing and so much more vile things. I would say it is 18+ but do not go into this if you're feeling uneasy with dead bodies, blood and killing because all of those things is the central theme of the game.

The storyline is very good too, emotional yet thrilling. Sometimes it can be hard to know when a cutscene has ended. Some games makes it very clear when a cutscene is happening and when gameplay is happening. Tomb Raider does not do that so you have to be ready for thr TB icon at the bottom of the screen, that is your only cue that it is possible to move again.",1660326661,1660326794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game reminded me a bit of Uncharted 2 (Gameplay, Themes) and Resident Evil 4 (Story, Gameplay, Environment).

STORY:
The story is focused on Lara as she is shaped into a tomb raider and that happens gradually as the story progresses. Your group is trying to flee an island, but they have to fight their way off from a cult.

GAMEPLAY:
Similar to Uncharted, the game is divided into puzzles and combat. Puzzles take place in tombs, but are more focused on physical puzzles compared to logic puzzles (Puzzles are more similar to the ones in the LoZ: Breath of the Wild shrines compared to Uncharted series). You climb and jump to move through the map similar to Uncharted. Combat is more personal than in Uncharted, where you can select between 4 weapons and alternate ammo types (similar to Bioshock). You can fight melee or range and perform finishers. Quick time events occur every once in a while in this game, but are not too bad.

PROS:
Character development exists for Lara
Music was decent
Puzzles were relatively easy to solve
Great setting
Great voice acting
Combat is fun

CONS:
Constant shaky camera causes motion sickness within an hour of playing
No character development for any other characters (All of them except maybe 2 or 3 are forgettable)
Characterization and the story do not mix well realistically (Don't cry and then forget and be okay 2 minutes later)

RATING: 7/10

There are four distinct types of thing that go on in the game: Puzzles, Fighting, Action Scenes, Cut Scenes.

The puzzles are fun but a bit simplistic. You won't be stuck for particularly long with these things none of them require more than a couple of steps and most are pretty straightforward to figure out.

The fighting isn't great enemies are as lethal as a hippie feather duster and have heads the size of flying saucers, but the combat sequences are short enough that it doesn't get in the way of main gameplay.

The action scenes are great buildings collapsing all around you whilst dodging flying debris pretty regularly, but again not so much as to get samey.

The cut scenes tell a good story, although I did get a bit fed up with occasionally having to randomly press a button at a specific point for little apparent reason.

In Depth Review Below.

One of the best adventure games you will ever get to play, hands down phenomenal. Thank You to who ever had the idea to reboot the franchise with this game, as a Tomb Raider fan i am more than happy.

Pros - Story is amazing because it forces the game to happen, without Lara becoming The Tomb Raider in this game she would have never left the island, animations are fluid and smooth, likable side characters, lots of weapons with amazing costumization, a semi open world that connects it all really well, lots of different environments, the graphics look amazing, lots of good and well put together collectables, voice acting is fantastic, physics are superb, fun puzzle segments, soundtrack is great and gives the game a feel of adventure, there is never a dull moment (great pacing), brutal kill cams for when she dies and kills enemies, very welcome but unexpect gore, optional tombs to explore and overall the gameplay together is fantastic, from combat to exploration.

Cons - Terrible subtitle boxes, truly awful, some unexpected bugs caused by the physics.

Nitpicks - Wish there were more tombs to explore and that they were bigger in scale not difficulty, also wish we got the PS4 character model version for the PC version as an update or even DLC honestly.

They're also very similar in terms of gameplay, with slight variations. But suffice to say, it's nothing bad, but also nothing remarkable. As most other action-adventure titles, very derivative of the metroidvania style.

What they all, also, have in common is the plethora of random bits and bobs to discover and pickup. It's sort of a OCD person's collect-o-thon, which was nice for a while, but then it really felt like it turned into a job. 

Another derivative thing, which I've really grown to be annoyed by are the action set-pieces where you have to dodge, bob and weave around a set trail, while usually there's something grandious happening around you (most often, some calamity that you have to get through). These were again pioneered a long time ago, in whatever first action title, but they've really grown stale. Especially since you often get the wrong direction, or just plain get it wrong, and you constantly have to reload the same section until you learn it by heart. Not fun anymore. But it's not been fun for a long time now.

But the worst thing about these games is that somehow they never manage to neither write a compelling story, nor make the character drama anything interesting. It's all so boring most of the time. Surprisingly, Shadow did manage a few nice heartfelt moments, but it also faceplanted while attempting some other ones. One really stands out, where they tried, for a brief while, to do turn Lara into a sort of Max Payne, revenge driven, killing machine. The idea wasn't bad, but somehow, with the way they wrote Lara, and the way she is, it just would not be in her character. So it really looked ridiculous.

For the first in the trilogy, and Rise, I honestly cannot remember any moments of nice characterization. And i finished Rise very recently, after having lost steam initially at about the midway point. That's another wrong thing about these games, they're so long and filled with so much content, that even in Shadow, towards the second half of the game, I just sprinted towards the ending as I just couldn't bear doing the random ""quests"" that they introduced with Shadow, where the lackluster writing and unintesting quests really standout. Ignoring those, you could say the main plot is serviceable. But with all the derails caused by the side quests, it really turns into a chore, and causes the game length to be artificially inflated.

Another very nice thing in Shadow, compared to the previous two was the addition of a lot more tombs and crypts to explore. It really seemed like they took the criticism of too much combat, in the previous games, to heart. Some of the tombs are actually very nice and challenging.

I realize I didn't say much about the first two games, but that's just how unremakable they are. And they are that, in most regards, except for visuals and level design. In these two areas, I think all three games really excel. Especially the visuals, and especially in Rise and Shadow. Some are just jawdroppingly beautiful. So much work must have gone into the landscapes. If only the games would have also had some fantastic stories to tell, with some compelling characters. If they wouldn't managed that, it would've been perfect. I really hope Crystal Dynamics manages to do something about all of this, in the UE5 Tomb Raider game they're apparently heading. Say what you will about Uncharted, at least they have some really charismatic characters, like Sullivan and Drake.

[u]This is how reboots should be done[/u]

edit, original review done in 2013 

Tomb Raider never really grabbed me back in its early days. I played 1,2 and 3 and found them fairly mediocre to be honest. I then paid no attention to the series at all until 2013 when the commercial's for the reboot started hitting tv. The commercial was enough to peak my interest as it look alot more realistic and dark. I decided to take the plunge when it came out and I was not dissapointed. I am looking forward to ROTT very much.

[h1]Single Player[/h1]
The story and characters are very good. Starts of very realistic and gritty, almost like a survival/thriller start. The story does develop more into fantasty and mystacism but its done in such a way that its enjoyable and is done right. The gunplay is fun and the ability to upgrade weapons and craft things is a really nice touch. The puzzles in tomb's and amount of collectables is great fun if you like me love collecting and 100% things.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
The Multiplayer is an odd one. I'm sure some people will absolutley love it but to me it seems unnecessary, the same way that other great single player games recieved what seems like a ""forced"" multiplayer mode for the sake of it being there. Games like Batman Arkham Origins and to an extent Max Payne 3. The MP can provide some fun, for me it was about an hour then I realised it was more of a chore than fun. So I grinded out the MP achievments and never went back.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
A truly fantastic title with a meh MP (Hence why it didnt make it back to ROTT), I am glad I overcame my doubt and went for it. This is one of the best reboots I have seen in a long time and would recommend it to anyone.

End Remarks: This game is incredible. The story is awesome and the ending answers this game, but leaves a lot in question which makes you want to purchase the other games and continue the story. The reason why this game is a 8/10 and not 9/10 or 10/10 is because there were occasional crashes, but for the most part it was fine, but also there were a few bugs where the game glitched and as a result I could not progress. I simply fixed these bugs by loading to the last checkpoint. Can be a bit annoying but it happens occasionally. Other than that, fantastic game.

Without the QTE button mash cutscenes, I might have loved it. They interrupt the flow of an otherwise excellent game. And oh boy - The salacious sadism vibe in those scenes, intentional or not, is... not subtle. 
You end up having to watch her die or get really hurt a lot to figure out which buttons the game designers wanted you to mash when, in order to get through the grueling cutscenes. 
But after a while, seeing Laura die or get brutalized in various ways started to look like the designer's point with these QTE scenes. I did finish the game, loved everything else about it. but those cutscenes left me unsettled. 
So I looked it up, and found I was not alone-
Turns out this was a very controversial game when it came out. Now that I finally got around to playing it, I can certainly see why. 

As Jim Sterling put it in a Destructoid article (ten years ago, and actually before many people  even played it -)
""I do not think, as some do, that the game is reveling in the abuse of women and trying to sexualize Lara’s physical and emotional torment for the gratification of its male audience. From the way the game is marketed, from the way its PR are talking about the game, the message radiates that the developers don’t quite know what they’re doing, and are firing a volley of tried-and-tested emotional trauma at the audience in the hopes that something will resonate. ""
https://www.destructoid.com/the-tomb-raider-scandal-everybody-is-right-and-wrong/

I think t's a good article, even if I don't agree with a lot of it. 
As for the whole male gaze thing - whether they intended it or not, it's clearly there. Getting hung up on intention is a mistake. Lots of things we do have effects we did not intend, especially in art. And yes, video games are absolutely an art.

The thing is, even if I go along with the idea that it somehow wasn't intentional, ""firing a volley of tried-and-tested emotional trauma at the audience in the hopes that something will resonate"" is bad art making. And when you do it, you DO know exactly what you are doing. The cutscenes do not flesh out the origin story. There is no real narrative or character development to be found there. Although they do physically move her from one location to another, they are just assorted scenes of punishing trauma and death if you mash buttons wrong, punctuated with the sound of Laura moaning- which essentially boils down to trauma porn. Trauma porn is not storytelling. It's manipulative and lazy at best. It's bad in movies, it's bad on tv shows, it's bad in books, and I think it's bad in video games too.",1658101140,1658176005,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros

Open world is massive. There is sense of an adventure in every corner of the world.
Survival element is fun part of the game. You need to craft weapons and items to survive the wilderness. There are lots of predators that you need to look out for like bears, wolfs, leopards and cougars. Predators are hard to take down so you need to play tactically.
There are lots of different way you can approach a situation when you encounter enemies. This makes the game fun. Stealth is very good in this game compared to Tomb Raider 2013. AI is smart, when they discover the dead body they alert the other guys and they then start to search for you.
Environment sounds are great and Great voice acting by Camilla Luddington.
Lots of weapons and gears to choose from. You can be a rambo with bow and arrows. There are different type of arrows to choose from like fire, poison and explosive arrows.
Graphics is awesome. This is one of the best looking games I've played.
Character animations and Facial Expressions are so life like that it is feel like you are watching a movie.

Side missions and Optional tombs are very good. There are lots of optional challenge tombs in the game that make this game a true tomb raider experience. Puzzles in the tombs are very well balanced. They are not to hard but not so easy too.
Challenges and collectibles give this game some replay ability.
Lots of achievements which allows you to experience the game in different ways if you like to 100% the game.
Story is very good. There are documents to find that allows you to dive in to the lore of the game further.
DLCs are great. You can modify the experience of DLCs using cards.
Optimization is great but to MAX it you need newer hardware.

Cons
Nothing I can find.

This game features an exotic Pacific island setting for you to explore, presented with incredible graphics and great attention to detail. Traversing the island by jumping and climbing is fun, solving optional hidden tombs is satisfying, and the controls are excellent. Unfortunately, the combat against human goons and wild animals is a bit too easy and simplistic. Although this game features many cutscenes, the story and characters are rather dull.

It's far from a perfect game though- most of the gameplay (specifically the grappling, stealth sections and radio dialogue) was pretty obviously done first in the Batman Arkham games. The plot itself is basically Lost, and side characters have all the purpose of Star Trek's redshirts.

If you're looking for something innovative, you'll probably be disappointed. But compared to the previous instalments in the series, this is a worthy restart to the Tomb Raider series.

I played this first shortly after it came out, and on this second play-through I was a bit surprised just how much a) gore and b) dumb button-mashing were in this game. I distinctly remembered both, but I really had forgotten just how prevalent it is. I'm so glad that in most new games we have accessibility options where you can either just keep holding down a button instead of having to mindlessly mash it for a few seconds - or even skip any interaction requirement whatsoever. Just let me enjoy the dramatic cutscenes instead of breaking up the tension with a ""PRESS Y TO BURN HIS FACE"" prompt. The gore is also way over the top, so many gigantic halls just filled to the brim with rotting bodies and skeletons, pools and rivers of blood... yuck. Aside from the gore, the torture porn aspect of the game also is a bit off-putting. Do we really need to see Lara get speared by a metal pipe, ripped to shreds by cliffs, etc., every time the controls aren't exact enough and a mishap occurs? That's _in addition_ to all the creepy shit during the storyline. It's just a bit much.

That said, that's all fairly high-level criticism. The core gameplay still is fun, and the game is mostly well-paced and not drawn out too long. The collectibles were mostly even fun to do, and didn't take particularly long after completing the main story. Shame that there's no maps for the challenges as well, that was the only annoying part. Encountered a game-breaking bug in one particular scene that could luckily be fixed by switching to 30fps just for that one scene. Also had to downgrade to an earlier build (which is luckily possible using the ""Betas"" menu) to avoid an issue where some (but not all, I didn't even notice it for the first few hours) HUD elements are displayed outside of the visible screen area. Shame that the Definitive Edition isn't available here, the game deserves a bit more polish.

The reboot draws heavy inspiration from the Unchartered series particularly in the combat and the cinematic set pieces but IMO stands on its own due its story and main character. Lara is not the swashbuckling Tomb Raider from previous games but instead she's just a girl trying to survive and save her friends (by becoming a one woman murder machine but hey it's still a video game!). Suffice to say, I'm in love with this more realistic version of Lara which definitely had me caring about her as opposed to the buxom caricature from previous entries.

Another highlight for me was the weapon system. The game gives you only 4 weapons but gives you the freedom as to how you approach each encounter. Do you prefer to snipe enemies from afar using the bow or blast up enemies in the face with the shotgun? I also really like how the game unlocks weapon upgrades at steady pace giving you a clear sense of progression. And to add to that, the upgrades are not all just ""MOAR DAMAGE"" but also modify your weapons in interesting ways (like allowing your arrows to penetrate armored foes or equipping a silencer on the assault rifle??)

My only minor criticism is that the ""tomb raiding"" the series is known for has been relegated to small optional sections featuring a single puzzle.

The main story can be completed under 20 hours, which is a nice length (not too long or short). Moreover, it has optional side content that can easily stretch beyond that playtime.

I don't really have any complaints about the title, it performs well, looks good and plays great. While the action isn't necessarily my cup of tea. I do still think is good. If I had to nitpick, I can only say that I didn't like the quick time events (QTEs) in geenral - as it breaks the momentum for me - and I didn't think they fit in well with the original Tomb Raider experience (PS1 era) that I was more familiar with. Luckily, the amount of QTEs isn't too excessive here (unlike in later series which completely ruins it for me).

In retrospect, I feel that the trilogy has gone the way of being generic, but the quality is undoubtedly that of a AAA title and it has also aged well. At its lowest discounted price, Tomb Raider is most certainly a steal and I would highly recommend getting it when it's on sale.",1656514540,1657026825,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Old, but still gold - this 9-year-old game is just as incredible as the first game that came out in '96. There are very few deals this summer sale that will give you this level of value for $3 CAD. The fact that you can get the best trilogy of this game for under $30 CAD is unbelievably good for fans of Third Person Adventure games. I completely forgot this game had multiplayer, and so did the community - just get the base game and your wallet will thank you. Put the extra few bucks you would have spent into future games in the series.

Out of all the times that they tried to breathe new life into this older franchise from 1996, it finally stuck through the rerelease in 2013. All it took was a little bit of plot, a hint of character development, and a feature-rich open world ripe for traversal (with the most fluid movement mechanics yet!) Honestly - I loved the characters that they had for this trip, and Lara finally felt relatable in the proverbial (and actual) storm she weathers. I will say that with how much ground they covered in such a short amount of time that characters could have benefited with a bit more screen time. Sure, you were happy to get what was conveyed both in good cinematics, tasteful flashbacks, and journal logs that were dictated by the character's voice actor. But, it would have played out better in witty ongoing dialogue. 

Combat and movement were honestly at their best in this one, and only got better after this. The use of the bow made so much sense for this sort of game, and will delight Hanzo mains or fans of The Last Of Us. Other weapons felt right, and every weapon had an alternative mode of fire that added another level of depth to the combat. Enemies also had an array of weapons and tactics to ambush Lara that added a lot of challenge to this cover-based shooter. But it was more of an adaptive form of cover - it didn't feel sticky in the Gears of War sense, allowing you to scramble around enemies and use a mix of weapons and hand-to-hand combat to best them. I do wish that Boss fights were a bit more challenging, but this was also responded to in sequels. 

Movement in the world is great, and incentives to move around in the open world were plentiful. Lara's movements are incredibly fluid, and the use of choice camera angles that didn't just go for butt shots was certainly more cinematic than pornographic. You can compare the quality of the visuals and combat to something better than the earlier Uncharted games, although the character development just isn't there. Quick-time events and events that relied on fast reflexes were reasonably fair, and supported tense moments in the game vs. substituting gameplay. Upgrades to weapons and level-up perks also worked well, although crafting and doing more with the flora and fauna were better perfected in later games. I saw maybe 3 animal variations, and hated the idea of just picking berries or mushrooms just for XP. Music and sound design was there, but nothing memorable.

At its core, the game pivots primarily to action over the old-timey fetch key and do puzzle structure of levels. If you wanted a balance, start with Anniversary or Underworld. A balance is eventually met in future sequels where they were able to build the trust with their action-focused player base not to bore them to death, but this game marks a distinct move away from puzzles and finicky movement and guess the aim/hit registration that older fans of the franchise adored. It is a defining title of action/adventure games from the 2010s, and will likely go down as being the title that revitalised the series. Buy it. The game has a lot going for it – just don’t forget to look around in the open world.

You can say what you want about the writing and voice acting, but the *game direction* is truly masterful and the technicians and artists who worked on the game did a superb job.

This game is just incredible. The emotion-rich story just gets you involved into the character of the game and immerses you into the beautiful but deadly scenery with mysteries unknown. It puts you not into in the body of Lara Croft but also her mind and makes you eager to find out what exactly is going on. It takes you into this mystical adventure and holds your hand and guides you through it while letting you fend for yourself.

Seriously this game is amazing. If you're into RPG then you're going to love this game. Yes its 9 years old now and the graphics, though amazing might not compare to some newer game, and potentially not have as much content as some of the other games BUT its really something that you must try.

There are a few complaints I had and one of them is that the story writing often felt like it was sloppy, cheesy and very often even ridiculous. It might be just the style of the series but as a stranger to this series, it pulled me out of the game. The other complaint is that the gameplay felt very scripted. I've heard that The Uncharted is rip off of old Tom Raider games and this Tomb Raider trilogy is a rip off of The Uncharted. I have no idea if it is true because I have no experience with the old Tomb Raider games but this game felt weaker compared to The Uncharted series in gameplay wise. The game's combat, stealth and even the traversal felt very scripted because of its lack of multiple approaches. Everything felt pretty linear and I just wish I had more control over how I would approach and clear out enemies. 

Other than these complaints, the game was pretty great. I had very little hope for the gameplay because the game is almost 10 years old now but the gameplay is very smooth, fun and I had no problem with it other than that I felt the melee combat was weak. I liked the weapon and skill upgrade system and I would give this game a 7 or 8 out of 10.

I had 3 crashes (locking the Deck, had to turn off) and sometimes, in the menus, resolution problems (the Deck screen only showed a corner of the image), but nothing game breaking. The only thing that I did, performance wise, was to lock at 40 frames and that gave me 3 hours gaming sessions, more than enough. The game mostly stayed at 40 FPS and I never saw the counter below 37. For a single player game it’s great, no need for more.
I loved the game, not as tough as the originals (never finished one, platform games are not my thing) but not as easy as Uncharted. You see Lara growing in powers, as it should in an origin story, and become more competent, more the Lara Croft that we know. That will force you to go back to the first levels to complete the game with 100% but it’s made in a way that makes sense.
I believe the story is the weakest point of the game. It’s nice, but a little bit too predictable, you can see the twists coming from a mile away. On the other hand the story doesn’t get in the way of the game and the cutscenes are very nice.
The puzzles make you stop and think but nothing too complicated.
The strongest point is its beauty. Everywhere you look there’s something interesting to see. The animations are also great (love to jump with Lara and use the pick to climb the walls). I would say that is the only problem playing on a Steam Deck. The small screen is great but this game deserves a bigger picture.

Strengths:
Excellent ambience
Excellent soundtrack
Almost perfect gameplay

Negative points:
The physics is very strange, in some moments the enemy after being shot down, simply goes flying, this also applies to objects in the scenery
Climbing many times unnecessary, it got repetitive and boring
The shotgun and simply useless, only served to complete the upgrades part, because in the game itself I almost never used it
Multiplayer mode with achievements, I completed most of the achievements available in single player mode, but now I have to run behind in a way to be able to complete achievement in an almost extinct multiplayer.

Final considerations:
The game itself is simply magnificent, the few defects do not disturb, I found the story acceptable, it could be much more explored at times, I recommend it to people who are fans of the old series, because it is a beautiful reboot, but I do not recommend it if you just want to get the achievements, because you’ve lost a lot of time to get the multiplayer achievements.",1590994498,1656273995,True,5,0,0.598765432834625244,0,True,False,False

Well I found that this is a more realistic Lara Croft, by that I mean she is more human and is shown with normal emotions, which I think caused some people to find her whiny and/or overly dramatic. Firstly this is how Lara became Tomb Raider so it is normal that she reacts to danger with fear. Besides she becomes a badass as the game progresses anyway, but again with her human side intact. And to be honest she is not a psychopath like the classic Lara. I must say I prefer this version. I think she was written very well, with the voice actress, Camilla Luddington conveying her emotions and experiences succesfully. I think she did a pretty good job.

The game itself is closer to reality. Yeah, people's injuries are the opposite of what would happen in real world, Lara goes through half of the adventure with a huge hole in her side, jumping and running around, she falls down huge heights without any permanent injury nor does she develop infections. Lara's mentor somehow travels and hikes all around the map with a leg that would most likely need to be cut. And the game has supernatural elements. 

But I found the tombs and buildings and map designs were closer to reality. The game doesn't have weird and extremely complex tombs where you ask who the hell would build a place like this, putting levers that would open the door to the toilet on the other side of the map behind spike traps or something. Not that I didn't enjoy that style (and the old games were a lot of fun) but this one is a better approach. Kudos to the developers.

Anyway overall I quite enjoyed this game. The story is good, the dialogues are good, graphics are excellent, pretty good debut overall. Only thing I really disliked about this game was the weirdness of the challenges. Mainly, the main plot is too hectic and there is always some kind of emergency going on. It doesn't let you breathe and there is no suitable time to explore the island. Yes you can travel around for weeks and the game won't punish you but it feels weird looking for ancient texts and random items while some friend is about to die all the time. I think either the plot should have some breathing moments, or the side quests should have been removed. 

Many more things to say but it is enough for a random review.

The multiplayer has been somewhat dead since 2014 since certain players have been cheating since the onset.  Epic Games killed the multiplayer when it bought the rights to it.  Don't buy the silencer.  It actually deactivates your multiplayer pistol's mods when you equip it.  Also, some skins are XBox exclusive, though some people know how to port that code to pc.

This is the first time I've played a Tomb Raider game, and the first time in a long time I've played a third person puzzle action-adventure game like this, with the last one probably being Indiana Jones for Wii. I came in pretty blind and I have to say it was a lot better than I was expecting, in every way. Any issues I have are really small things.

Note: I played on Hard, and finished with 91% completion.

+ First of all: it's fun!
+ Voice acting that's actually good!
+ The story is pretty good and the characters actually had thought put into them.
+ Overall polished mechanics: all the different types of movement have a distinct feel to them, and the same can be said about the weapons (though the gunplay could be better). Survival Instinct is really fun and it's cool to be able to see the game world in a different light, it makes objectives and items easy to spot without cheapening the feeling of reaching them.
+ Combat difficulty is fitting for the type of game this is. That is, it's pretty easy, but not so easy that you can just run around aimlessly, you can still get gunned down quickly if you're far from cover.
+ Graphics are respectable, not top-tier even for 2013 standards but certainly good enough. (By the way, you can tell the entire facial animation budget went into Lara's face during cutscenes, lol.) On the other hand, it certainly performs well, I played with a GTX 1070 at 1440p Ultimate and only went below 60 when looking at the entirety of the largest areas at once.
+ The puzzles were enjoyable, made you think but not terribly difficult. Unfortunately, there aren't that many tombs.
+ Collectibles done right: they add character depth and worldbuilding. I have to criticize GPS caches (aka geocaches) for not really doing that, but I actually [b]wanted[/b] to find all the documents, relics, and treasure maps. Some you can only reach by revisiting previous areas with new tools, which some may not like, but I didn't mind at all.

= It's a bit quicktimey for my tastes, you need to mash keys pretty regularly.
= There's a mechanic for peeking around cover, which is nice, though I had a few occasions where it didn't quite kick in, mostly when trying to aim around walls up a staircase.
= Some baked-in animations are at 30 fps.

- Three bugs worth mentioning: I got phased through a closed gate, and one time I was respawned [i]after[/i] the fight I died in, not before. Neither a big deal, if anything they were amusing. An annoying one was that a certain cave didn't load in and if I tried to follow the objective marker I would fall out of the world. Fast travelling away and back with lower graphics settings seemed to fix it.
- The shotgun kinda sucks.

The multiplayer is wasted though, who buys a Tomb Raider game and expects a shooter-MP?

Also, Crystal Dynamics: less gory deaths next time, please. I don't need to see Lara's head get impaled everytime I miss a QTE...and then she gets slowly dragged down along the spike. It's unnecessary, overly bloody and too long.",1455037770,1654727832,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I loved it. It was well told and easy to follow. The characters, while only briefly seen throughout the story, allows you to grow attachment towards them. It's great how it plays out. It took place in Japan!

Gameplay:
It was well done! The combat felt too easy, however. Fire fights felt too video-game-y as in, there are a bunch of bad guys pointing guns at you and you're able to easily pick off each one one-by-one yet they can't kill you. By the time I beat the game, Lara easily had been shot hundreds of times and had killed hundred of bad guys all by herself. Lara comes off more of someone like Batman or another superhero instead of a human. She is able to just beat all odds and feels immortal. It's also really fun having the option to be stealthy in order to try and avoid getting attacked.

The parkour elements are fun and throughout the game I'm just in awe of how Lara is able to be so fearless and cheat death so many times and still survive.

There are many collectables to be found, adding to the replay value. Also, the RPG elements are a nice touch and it's fun to progress Lara, even though the combat is already easy enough.

Sound:
Well done! Good sound track and effects.

Overall:
It's a great game! Lots of fun. My biggest complaint is the combat is too easy and unrealistic, even on the hardest combat setting.",1654650698,1654650698,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The dialogue isn't super well written, sometimes the characters seem to not realize things that have already been established for a long time, and their methods of conversing seem... well like they're having their own separate conversations at each other.  Some of the supporting characters are pretty annoying as a result, and others were annoying from the start, or lacked depth enough to make them so.  That being said, Lara's voice acting and the overall story is very good.  The game play is super fun, and the leveling systems are really well done.  Honestly the way the different sections of the map connect back together later in the game reminds me of Super Metroid, and considering that that is my favorite game that's high praise.  There's also a TON of stuff here for completionists to do, and the story is a fair length (Though on the topic of story at the end it is revealed the Storm Guard still live on the island, which makes the existence of the Oni confusing, as I was under the impression they were the ghosts of the Storm Guard, but whatever).  Over all it's a good game with some flaws that bring it down.  I recently purchased Rise of the Tomb Raider, and am excited to see how it improves on the original.  I would warn anyone who has motion sickness that the camera in this game really enjoys shaking around.  8/10

(Edit: It also has the same ""once you reach this point you can't go back"" issue as Super Metroid, and seeing as I didn't realize I could have multiple save slots, I got locked into the end game without 100% and did not have the option to go back.  This would be forgivable, but when you scroll through all the fast travel camps ""Sea Cliff Bunker"" is not listed, but is an area that has collectibles.  As a result I thought I completed the game 100% and instead got an infuriating 99% completion rate.  I looked back, saw the sea cliff bunker, attempted to head there only to find I was locked in the end game.  This is probably the worst thing about the game.  Docked the final score half a point for this infuriating garbage.)",1549688905,1654547924,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- There are a few purposeful bad decisions in user experience (1) like using symbols for hand instead of just showing which key you need to press, I remember it had me very confused for a minute or two during the first playthrough. Or (2) when the main menu screen moves too low and you need to wait for it to come back to click anything.
- Even on my first playthrough, if not the first 10 minutes of launching the game have had quite a few both visual and regular bugs, and them still being in the game after being out for so long, is a tad embarrassing tbh.

[u][b]TL,DR Review[/b][/u]

An action-packed re-imagining of Lara Craft which is heavily inspired by the Uncharted series. While the game-play holds up for the most part, this version unfortunately never received the graphical updates of the Definitive Edition on PS4/XB1. It's a huge visual difference so you may want to consider playing that version instead.

[u][b]Full Review[/b][/u]

I'm going to say upfront that Tomb Raider 2013 is a good game, but I need to start by saying that it has bothered me from start to finish on how ugly this game looks at times on PC. I've been running this game in ultra with no problem and certain parts of the game look like I'm playing through an early PS3 title. I highly suggest to consider playing the PS4\XB1 Definitive Edition for a vast improvement on the experience.

Anyway, this is a reboot of the Lara Croft series that many people know from the PS1 era and while the series has had entries on the PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, it was never to the same fanfare as the original entries. Arriving in 2013, this reboot has removed any sort of the 90s sexuality in favor of a survival heroine akin to the characters of The Descent movie and for the most part it works. Lara herself is well written as a character who starts as someone who is just trying to survive to by the end of the game has grown into the Tomb Raider. Environments are varied enough for the setting that the story takes place in and combat is fast-paced with decent puzzles sprinkled throughout the campaign. However, there are a few more elements that I have issues with.

Moving past the graphics situation I mentioned previously, the biggest issues I have with the game is the story and the combat. The story is fine for what it is as a catalyst for Lara as an origin story, but the rest of the characters are really uninteresting. It feels like someone cast a seasoned AAA actress in a summer blockbuster movie and filled in the rest of the character roles with actors from the local community theater. At the end of the day, these characters don't matter.

Combat is....fine, the controls and handling are what you expect from a competent 3rd person shooter. The issue is that there is so much combat. It probably came down to time, effort or perhaps budget but overall there wasn't enough tombs\exploration and way too much combat as a whole. The tombs are also an issue to a lesser extent, it's not like they're bad but most of them don't feel like tombs but more like rooms. They don't always have the sense of scale like they should. This might be because this was made for the 360\PS3 generation, perhaps there was a space or memory limitation behind it.

Multiplayer is fine, standard modes like Team Deathmatch and a typical unlock system for loadouts. Surprisingly there is a small amount of players to find matches here in the end of 2019 so it might be worth trying out to see if you like it.

Some of the issues could be fixed in sequels that were developed for current game consoles while others are issues that many games face and that usually just requires additional polish. Ultimately I should reiterate that I think this is a good, enjoyable game and that these issues standout more to me because how well made it is for the most part. Tomb Raider 2013 gets a thumbs up and is a solid choice if you're looking for a good 3rd person action adventure.

If you look thru the story point of view, yes it’s a great game.
Graphics are good, even for today standards, voice over is great and we got an engaging origin story for a beloved character, but here is where it all stops.

This game didn't age well, by any means.
The excessive camera shaking will give most people motion sickness, and the excess of quick time events not only breaks the immersion, but also gets extremely annoying as the game progresses.
I don’t know who took the decision to add these features to the game, but while I was playing all I could think of was this person should be banned from the game industry for life time.

On the top of these issues, there is also a glitch in the Tomb of the Last Adventurer DLC, which might force you to load a previous game save if you don't know about it.
Have a look at the DLC reviews for more information:

Sad, but it looks to be the way Square Enix works, as there are other games released by them which were never pached to fix its issues.

In the end of the day, is Tomb Raider a 9 out of 10 game? Surely not, most likely 6 or 7.
This is an ok game.
It's unfortunate how blind today's players are when making their reviews, as this will not help anyone. People like this are doing a disservice to the gaming industry, and to other players.

If you like Lara Croft, I would recommend you getting Rise of the Tomb Raider instead of this one, as it’s a better cinematic-gaming experience. Even on discount sale, this game is not worth the time.",1612536476,1653653321,False,2,0,0.496938079595565796,0,True,False,False

I can say overall that this game and the 2nd installment Rise of the Tomb Raider, fight for the top spot(although I'll give it to this game for reasons explained later). The narrative and the game play/skill system really work well to show a novice Lara Croft and her first steps into being the OG Lara Croft. Lara does have a character arc here and if this was a standalone game it does a perfect job being a prequel game to the OG Tomb Raiders.Now spoilers for this game and the rest of the trilogy. [spoiler]  In the last fight Lara uses her signature dual pistols 1 of the pistols being a memento of her mentor who died protecting her. In the follow games Lara never uses dual pistols again WHY??? Doesn't carry that gun around as a memento, and doesn't use any of her multitudes of pistols in combination with each other. Disappointing and a missed opportunity [/spoiler]

Rise of the Tomb Raider is great and is an improvement to the first game I believe its the favorite for most players. [spoiler]Lara deals with her late Father's last quest.She wants to do right by her father and has dedicated her life to finishing his last quest and clearing his name. She struggles with the ""ends justifies the means"" as the villains will sacrifice everything to get what they want, and Lara teeters on that seesaw for a little while until inevitability doing the good thing. The story/history tells and resolves itself well, and the side characters and the villains(well one of them) are memorable and interesting.  [/spoiler]

Shadow of the Tomb Raider reuses the narrative beats from the first and second game really poorly. We go through sacrifice again, family issues again. I was waiting for a WOW factor and I never got it. It felt like the game was building up for a huge climax, and once that ending came around I felt cheated. Very little payoff, plotlines that heavily relied on reading collectibles and dlc and even then it felt weak. Side characters are pretty forgettable apart from some ""badass"" moments. The villain was ""okay"" because I did his dlc. His motivations are understandable but they tried to paint him as ambivalent ""nice guy"" then he does the ""ends justifies the means"" thing again and we get atrocities and mass killings. Wrote off the big bad organization in dialogue by a grunt. They heavily invested in tombs this time around(so many tombs), but the rewards were either just old skills from the previous games, or a very minor passive buffs.Nothing truly rewarding or awe inspiring.

Gameplay gripes [spoiler]
My gripes in terms of gameplay is that skills from the previous games do not carry over. Like rolling after falling. It's like we're starting with newbie Lara even though we know she's a badass now. I'm fine with not having a full arsenal like equipment/weapons but having previous learned skills locked away and having us unlock them again feels lazy and makes the previous journey seem pointless, this is especially bad in the 3rd game as skills picked up in both the 1st AND the 2nd game need to be relearned with skill points or are locked away in tombs!!!
Gameplay wise the trilogy has a bad habit of removing Lara of her weapons and having her stealth, and kill her way through mobs of enemies. These enemies generally have guns and knives, Lara does not pick them up?????. An equipment in the 2nd game is called a Combat Knife, it's purpose? To cut rope(and faster stealth kills). So how do you get this marvelous equipment. Do you craft it out of some scrap metal or stone? Nope. Do you loot it off of the enemies who try to run at you with a knife? Nope. You pick it up in an old soviet mine. ???? It's really contrived. To be fair you do make your combat knife in the third game from a piece of scrap metal(WOOO!!!). You can also buy upgrades for this knife! Now you would think buying an upgrade for this knife would be replacing it with an actual knife, maybe one of those spiffy combat knives. Nope, you actually upgrade your scuffed knife. You know why this irks me? Because in the SAME GAME you lose all your items again and you actually pick up a knife from an enemy(wow!!!). And what does she do after that section? Goes back to her scrap knife.  [/spoiler]",1653537326,1653537326,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What I liked:
- Visuals are still pretty good for a 9 year old game. 
- Audio quality is fairly good although the dialogue and the voice acting from the supporting characters can be a bit cheesy. 
- Controls are pretty comprehensive from the get go. 
- Combat is pretty fun as well.

However, here are my complaints:
- No run toggle or tap to run. Makes exploring tedious.
- Shaky camera - I had to install a mod to disable the camera wobble since I can't play for 5 minutes without getting a heaedache. It's not just in cut scenes for a more cinematic feel. It's there even in gameplay.
- Stealth seems sorta hit or miss. It's hard to tell when I'm not able to be seen especially without a dedicated ""cover"" button. There's a section in the forest with soldiers and wild wolves, and it's complete BS. Once you're discovered, everyone knows your location even the wolves. And those wild wolves only go after you for some reason.
- Enemies are kinda BS. Their bullets seem to be able to go through rocks sometimes or they have crazy good aim while they rain bullet hell on you.
- Maps feels pretty linear.
- Voice acting from side characters sometime don't feel very convincing like say after a crazy climax and a character goes ""oh thanks, Lara"" in a near monotone voice.
- As mentioned earlier, dialogue can get a bit cheesy and ruin the seriousness of the situation.

Although, I listed way more negatives than positives, it was still very fun to play overall. If you have motion sickness, it's probably worth looking into getting the Yamatai mod to disable the camera wobble because it's that bad IMO. Hard to beat for 2 bucks. At 15, it's still pretty cheap but ehhh.",1653515896,1653515896,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Totally soaked, exhausted and injured, young Lara sits by a fireplace and thinks about what just happened...[/b]

The research ship she was on to search with her colleagues for the remains of a sunken kingdom in the Dragon Triangle has sunk. Her colleagues are probably all dead, Lara is injured and alone on this island. In the middle of nowhere…

Unlike usual with Tomb Raider, exploring burial chambers or caves is not quite as important in the reboot, even if you can still climb around and discover secrets outside of the action levels in extensive areas. But if you keep your eyes open as usual, you can find USB sticks, various artefacts and maps that show hidden extras, treasure chests or flotsam.

[b]And what do I need all this stuff for?[/b]

Tomb Raider now offers a talent system and weapon upgrades, and all you need is enough debris, experience points, and as so often, a campfire.
As soon as you sit down at one of these campfires, the upgrade menu opens where you can exchange the points you have earned so far for new skills or health improvements and also buy weapon upgrades. It is also possible to fast travel to areas you have already visited from here. This saves you a lot of time if you have missed something, such as a burial chamber.
However, the hidden burial chambers cannot always be explored immediately, as often a piece of equipment is missing that is only obtained in the course of the game. But even if you can open a burial chamber, the secret inside is not always that easy to reveal. You often have to find the right switch combinations, cleverly climb to other levels or balance platforms in order to uncover well-kept secrets.

[b]Oddly enough, Lara suddenly drops phrases such as ""... I hate graves"" during the game.
Eh ? What ? I'm sorry, what ?
For years it has been about nothing but graves, or have I missed something?[/b]

At the start of the game, the still quite “whining brat” who often complains about how bad everything is right now, quickly mutates into a killer bride who does more than just skilfully. Lara automatically seeks cover as soon as she can and shoots at the unclever AI from behind cover. Unfortunately, this means that Lara's transformation is somewhat lost in the actual story in combat and explosion overkill. As the saying goes, ""and that's where the dog is buried"". Action is by no means bad, absolutely not, especially not in such a spectacularly staged cover shooter. However, without all these explorations through dark caves in an atmospheric world, a Tomb Raider is somehow still not a Tomb Raider as you know it.

However, the strengths and weaknesses are more or less balanced and if you don't really like tomb robber activities and can do without other things like challenging jump passages, you will definitely be rewarded with a pretty good action spectacle.

[b]It's not perfect, but overall a positive feeling still lingers after a few hours.[/b] 
This is probably mainly due to the last third of the game, in which the demands, the puzzles and the tension increase noticeably and Lara just seems a bit more authentic as an archaeologist. Nevertheless, I would have wished for more exploration, less collecting mania and more survival.

A sensational reboot of Lara Croft into the gaming world. This game is an action packed thriller with explosive set-pieces and a storyline to root for.

The Lara Croft we know is absent. Long gone the duel wield weaponry and the unbeatable killer machine of a women we love, instead we get a timid and frightened young lady who is stranded in a japan-ish bermuda triangle.

Hunting for her life are the fanatics led by an intriguing character named Mathias who wants to resurrect the fabled Sun Queen who used to rule the world ages ago. However, Lara is not alone in her journey, she has her mentor & friend along with her best friend Sam and a group of rag tag explorers. 

The atmosphere is beautiful and horrific at the same time. Equally, gorgeous is the lead heroine Lara, who instead of over-sexualized in previous games, is depicted as an average explorer who when faced with the mortal dangers quickly sprangs into action. Camilla Ludington the voice of Lara has done an amazing job!

The puzzles are few but very intelligent and realistic, Lara dont have to push a button to solve everything like in past, here she has to manipulate surroundings in order to solve the puzzles.

This game is amazing, I have already played in 4 times and yet havent explored everything. After playing its sequel (Rise of Tomb Raider) and the series finale (Shadow of Tomb Raider) I conclude that this one is by far the most superior of the trilogy.

For Lara worshipper like me it was a mandatory game to play, however I would encourage every action/adventure lover out there to try this amazing masterpiece.",1652973948,1653219213,True,10,0,0.650724351406097412,0,True,False,False

Things done well:

Story, being trapped on a cursed island with cultists

Action whilst the combat isnt as good as rise or shadow it is still really fun 

Characters considering they have little screen time they are really well written 

Lara (separated from characters since shes the protagonist)

ending (wont spoil)

aptmosphere, felt dark and disturbing the whole way through

Things done wrong:

challenge tombs were very short litterally consisting of lara going from one floor to another, considering some of these are dlcs they really suck 

the map system was somewhat confusing which made the challenges difficult

small outfit selection which doesnt really matter

Additional Notes:

additionally this game feels more like a horror than the usual tomb raider games, having a much darker and isolated aptmosphere.

However, this game is riddled with bugs on PC that from what I can tell have been there since the game launched. I originally played this on both the Xbox 360 and the One, and never had a single bug or glitch the entire time. I immediately had problems on the PC version. Almost every single animal in the game didn't walk and just hovered above the ground, i had many problems where I couldn't interact with items or ledges and had to reset my game, sometimes doors wouldn't open and again, had to reset my game. I had the game just completely close several times when I would alt+tab out to change what I was listening to. The biggest thing that only happened once, but there is only one spot for it to happen was in a cave with a wolf. When the wolf attacks you, you are given on screen prompts to attack it. This took me 18 minutes to get past one wolf. That scene would sometimes not show the prompts, show the wrong prompts, or sometimes show every single prompt all at once and you don't know which one to press. This is one of the bugs that after looking around, it seems that this has been an issue since it launched originally and just has never been fixed.

However, the story in this game is great. Like I said previously i had played this on the 360 and the One, but I had never actually beaten the game, the farthest I ever got was probably about 80% of the story. I am glad I finally came back to finish the game, even if I had a rough time doing so. The open world is very fun to explore and other than the floating animals, which doesn't have an effect on gameplay, worked perfectly. I would absolutely recommend this game, as long as whoever is playing it knows what might happen when they do.",1651382773,1651464829,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[quote=]A reboot to the original Tomb Raider. It was released on March 2013.[/quote]
[h1]Story[/h1]
Lara and her friends goes on an expedition on the ship Endurance, attempting to find the Lost Kingdom of Yamatai, but are sudden struck by a storm. They end up on an island that seems to have dangerous habitants.
It's simple and takes you to what you want: action and adventure.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Adventure third-person shooter. When you are not shooting humans, you will be climbing, running from collapsing places and exploring. The game has certain RPGs elements, like XP, abilities and upgrades (both by exploring or progressing in the main campaign). And according to your progress, you will unlock new weapons.

[h1]Characters[/h1]
While they serve their purpose, most of them aren't enjoyable. They are there sometimes, but you probably won't miss them when you are alone.

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
Okay soundtrack. It fits the moments in the game, it gets the job done... but most of it you won't remember.

[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]
[quote=][b]Pros[/b]
- Good gun-based combat.
- Good exploration in the main campaign.
- Excellent graphics for its time.
- Okay story.

[b]Cons[/b]
- Most Tombs are optional and aren't appealing to explore.
- Characters aren't memorable.[/quote]

I don't think you should give a review on a game that you played over and over until you know how to beat it in your sleep. Your review should be honest and you should complete the main story before giving your review. Your review should not be based on the fact that other players will be upset you gave their favorite game a negative review. For a game that came out in 2013 it would of had a higher rating, but by today's gaming standards this game would be unacceptable. One thing that makes the game a pain is our monitors have much higher resolutions then they did back in 2013, and the Quick Time Button events are hard to see and react to with these higher resolutions. This causes the scene to be failed over and over and over until the player is ready to just give up and go do something else.

I played the original Tomb Raider 'back in the day' and loved it. As an adventure gamer by trade, however, I was never coordinated enough to survive to the end.

After playing Horizon Zero Dawn and improving my stealth/action skills, I was looking for my 'next game' and someone suggested the Tomb Raider series.

I've really enjoyed this first game. I love traveling with the 'new' Lara and exploring a diverse and detailed world. I set the difficulty level to 'Easy' and managed to find collectibles, progress, and survive up to the ending 'big boss' (who I have yet to kill). The platforming does not require perfect precision and I found the controller configuration easy to work with and intuitive. For major battles, I resorted to my keyboard/mouse which gives me better aim.

This is a great game for adventurers who want to try their hand at stealth and combat. There is a story, likable characters,  collectibles, and an occasional ambush.  Survival is based on taking cover and keeping your adrenaline in check.  For those new to the franchise, there is an invaluable set of guides on ""Stella's Tomb Raider Site"" that provide tips/techniques and survival strategies. Achievements include multi-player challenges so 100% was not on the table for me.

My second playthrough in 2022 was 20h (i think it took me about 15h for the story and an extra 5 hours for the 100% IG completion.)

Positive : 
- The reboots is the natural evolution of the game, although we need more boss fights.
- Gameplay : Solid, straight to the point
- Graphics still hold well for 2013
- Good story 
- Lara's face is the best face imo
- The best of the Tomb Raider reboots so far imo 

(even the TR-3 reboot Shadow of the Tomb Raider is not as good despite having better graphics, gameplay being convoluted unnecessarily but not in a way to understand just that it didn't add anything to the gameplay as much as the first game, the choices didn't really matter as someone pointed out: ""you take 
a skill that gets obsolete almost right away, You get some weapons/equipment so late in the game that it doesn't even matter because they are used for optional things.)

Endless traumas, broken bones, and puncture wounds that would render even the hardest of beefcakes hospital-bound, shirked off with nothing more than a shake of the head and some transient grogginess. Constantly jarring, in terms of suspension of disbelief.

The actual raiding part of this Tomb Raider title is drastically cut back, too, in terms of puzzle intricacy. But everything lost in this regard is more than made up for in general traversal and environmental depth. Nonetheless, a regression for the franchise, that wasn't addressed until Shadow.

All that said, the moment-to-moment gameplay itself is a great riff on the original formula, with better combat, better player agency, and some great cutscene acting. Even the multiplayer is enjoyable, if you can find a match this long after the horse has bolted.

In terms of compatibility and performance, 2013 holds up perfectly, a decade later.

My only real nitpick is the disappointment that comes with Rhianna Pratchett and Jackson Lanzing not getting to portray Sam and Lara's relationship in the manner originally intended. Moreover, that Sam is then relegated to the looney bin, in later titles, because Square Enix lacked the balls to step up to the mark.

However, they missed out on that opportunity the moment they chose to throw out the reboot that ends with TR: Underworld & create what is known as ""survivor Lara"". I perfer Lara in the old games because she's more fierce & a badass. She doesn't wine about shit or cry because she's about to die or whatever. In the old games, Lara is quick to protect herself, take cover, do whatever she has to do to keep herself safe. There's so much of a challenge with the old games & that's what makes them more fun. The puzzles as well.
All in all, it does not matter how good or decent the graphics of a game are because what really matters in the end is it's playability & story, to me at least. 

Yes, this game runs and maybe has a .. mediocre predictable story. I'll give you that. But if I had to choose, I would 100% take the old tomb raiders over this 2013 reboot. 

 I will write more once I have put more hours into the game.",1649410806,1649410806,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Story is a bit cliche and basic but it get's the job done, puzzles aren't too complicated, so as is platforming, but they are still fun, audio's great, shooting is also decent, there's also stealth elements, or you can just go guns blazing with your modified guns. There's experience points you can spend on improving your skills and scraps you can find to upgrade your weapons. Quite a few collectables to find and secret caves/areas to explore. There's also a multiplayer mode but I'm doubtful anyone still plays, haven't really given it a shot myself.

+ Platforming is smooth and engaging
+ Solid combat with upgradable weapons
+ Puzzles are decent and challenging
+ Lots of Collectables to find

[b] The Negatives: [/b]
- QTEs can be annoying sometimes
- Hunting feels pointless
- Multiplayer is average and uninspired

Also started the trend of ""Character Torture""=""Character development""; might be indirectly responsible for Amnesia:Rebirth, Outlast 2 and RE3:Remake being shit. At least this one had a cool mystery to unearth with the Japanese Monsters.
Still a decent action-story game for it's time.

EDIT:
Have to add that, after playing the next 2 games I am really thankful that this one is way shorter. There is very little padding in between the setpieces of the story and for one the mystery/paranormal stuff is interesting since it's not literally rehashed. Also there are little to no  flashbacks, which helps us feel more immersed in the setting of being trapped on an island.",1609025650,1648706125,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
