I use this for playing Wolcen and it's very easy to track where the mouse pointer is and therefore actually hit enemies - the original mouse pointer in Wolcen is very small and easy to lose track off in the special effects and chaos of the game. Yolo, made Wolcen playable for me by allowing me to pick a 'visible' mouse pointer.

Is it worth the £3.50? Depends on how many mouse pointer games you play or whether adding on that £3.50 means you haven't wasted the other £40+ on a game. For me it was worth it even if I only ever use it for Wolcen but I'm sure I will come across this problem again.........maybe.

*Edit*
The 1.6.0 made this program kind of obnoxious to use. I'm annoyed enough by it to no longer use it. I won't take down my past review because I got a lot of use out of it. But maybe consider reading other reviews after the update to get your own idea. The cursors are massive by default, the UI feels a bit more intrusive, and the functionality seems broken in some places.

*Edit 2*
Overall after some more time with it, I think that the update was actually for the better. I will stick to the idea that the app is a bit intrusive when it comes to changing cursors compared to how it used to.

Different mouse designs and colours can be set for different software programs i.e. games and then you can even set different designs & colours for different aspects within the same software.
For example you can set a cursor for navigating a games user interface then set a completely different one for when targeting items in a game or an enemy. Once more this can be easily done by mousing over something like an item and then using a quick keyboard shortcut and boom its set, then with additional keyboard shortcuts you can the size and colour.

Overall very impressed, highlights:

* Several Different mouse designs.
* Wide range of colours.
* Varied sizes.
* Customise cursors for differ software programs.
* Customise different courses for different functions within the same software.
* Customisable keyboard shortcuts.
* Low Memory and CPU utilisation. 
For me it's 5.4 MB RAM and 0.1-0.2% CPU utilisation when running, It does increase however if you load up the YOLO UI to do any config to the app itself e.i. to change keyboard shortcuts but it goes back down again when the UI is closed.

If you play a online game using keyboard & mouse then YoloMouse is well worth the price tag. While playing online games where there is a lot of stuff going on the screen like world bosses and what not. It's quite easy to lose focus where your mouse pointer is so you got take a second or two to find it. During that 1-2 seconds could end up wiping your group if you are doing game content that is not easy.

That's where YoloMouse comes in to play it runs the background. It allows you to change your mouse pointer do you want it bigger you can do that. Do you want a mouse pointer color you can't miss seeing you can do that too.

If you are currently playing games on a TV with your computer, I have good news for you!  You're in the right place, this is the best program you could possibly ask for, get it, get it now.  

Not only will it enlarge the cursor in any game or program, but elegantly you can enlarge the actual in-game cursors as well!  You simply move your mouse around to each of the locations where the mouse cursor switches from one to another and enlarge each one.  Like when you enter a text box or move to the edge of a window to shrink it, you'll find each one eventually and can change each cursor as you go, for you are always going to want this program running.

Great application.

Pros-
1: It has worked fine over every game I have tested.
2: It is full-screen compatible.
3: Easy on demand changes to size, color, and shape.
Cons-
1: It does not work on certain mouse over actions such as talking to NPCs where it will default back as long as you are hovering over the prompts.
2: It will not stay shown if there are actions which cause the cursor to disappear in game such and using M1&M2 to move.

The cons cannot be changed because it replaces the in game cursor but I had to add them.

Or maybe you're in an intense situation and your crosshair isn't noticeable enough when there's too much other stuff going on. This fixes that.

After having the old Yolomouse from the website for about 1 1/2 Years I would recommend this. But after deciding to buy the software to support the developers, I now  have to restart the software randomly during games because the Program just stops working.

Update: I got a answer from the developer that there will be a update out soon. Meaning he said about 5 days. This was on 12.May.2020. I cant recall that I ever Updated the Software  and it still behaves the exact same way. Randomly when I start a new League of Legends Game it just wont work and I have to close it in the Task Manager because it wont respond when shutting it down with the Steam client. 

It also completely crashed sometimes random during other things and just painted the whole screen white, burning my eyes out at night, and then proceeds show the standard windows crash screen where you can choose to close the program or wait for it to respond.

[h1] YoloMouse[/h1]
[i]YoloMouse is a neat little piece of software that allows you to change your ingame cursor for more visability. I've personally been using the non-steam version of it for Path of Exile for quite some time and it really helps me keep track of my character in such a chaotic game. [/i]

[h1] Custom Cursors[/h1]
While it is possible to add custom cursors it could use some work. Currently to add custom cursors you have to;
[olist]
[*] Collect your .CUR or .ANI files and rename them to numbers between 0 and 89 (Example: 12.ANI).
[*] Copy them to YoloMouse\Cursors.
[*] Restart yolomouse.
[*] Test using CTRL ALT 1 and CTRL ALT 3.
[/olist]
[h1] Stuff I'd love to see added to YoloMouse[/h1]
[list]
[*] Easier adding of custom cursors
[i]A small thing, but would be useful.[/i]
[*] Add an option to not have the ""in game""
[i]While the software currently has it, it only works if you have start with windows checked. Which I'm not interested in.[/i]
[*] Steam Achievements
[i]I just personally like achievement systems, even if it is software. Kinda like Wallpaper engine, it encourages me to explore the software.[/i]
[/list]
[h1]TLDR;[/h1]
[i]A neat software if you play chaotic games where you loose track of your character / cursor. [/i]

[b]EDIT:[/b] 
I love how great this developer is at responding to reviews, let's me know it's been seen. Great work!

You just press the hotkey when your game is displaying a cursor, and then the cursor gets replaced with a YoloMouse cursor which can be resized or have the colour changed. It's pretty easy to use for games where you might lose track of your cursor. 

The YoloMouse cursors aren't exactly very attractive, though, and I would like to see a possibility to have themed cursors that correspond to common game cursors - e.i. thematically and graphically consistent cursors replacing cursors you often find in games. For example, there's no speech bubble cursor in YoloMouse.

Using Yolo mouse is as easy as downloading it, launching it, launching whatever game you want and increasing the cursor size (which increases the in-game cursor, so you don't have to use one of the pre-installed cursors that don't match the game's aesthetic). 

Even better, Yolo mouse automatically keeps separate profiles for every game you use it with. So my desktop cursor remains the same size I want, then I can launch a game like Dawn of War and the cursor will automatically change to the last cursor size I set. Then when I'm done and exit the game, the cursor reverts to the normal desktop cursor.

I first tried yolomouse about a year ago.  I was in fits of laughter when my housemate showed me this great big glaring mouse pointer and just had to try it.  It has completely changed my experience of playing Path of Exile.

I used to have trouble seeing where my mouse was but now I always know where it is because it is big and bright and pink and kind of like having an elephant in my room - hard to miss.

One of those simple things that makes a big difference.   All it does is make the mouse pointer absurdly huge and colorful, but it makes game playing so much more fun being able to see the cursor.

I had a few problems with it early on in Harvest league.   According to the dev, that was a temporary POE thing, but it seems all sorted now.  If you had problems early Harvest league and put yolo away, it might be time to pull it out again.
