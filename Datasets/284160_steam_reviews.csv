The physics and graphics are seriously impressive, especially considering how old the game is. And let's talk about the devs for a second — they're on another level. Not only do they keep dropping some of the most awesome updates, but they actually listen to the community! Wish more devs were like them, you know?

I've spent over 800 hours on this game, and let me tell you, it's still my favorite, even with it not being completely finished. And for only 20 bucks? That's an absolute steal. Honestly, I'd happily spend even more money on this masterpiece.

After trying many different simulators, I can affirm that BeamNG.drive is the best of them all. The Reason? The Physics engine. Because the physics engine has been build from the ground up, the driving and crashing physics of this game are out of this world. The risk of destroying your car makes this the most educational and  realistic driving simulator available. Let me explain.

I love racing rally with games like Dirt Rally 1 and 2, and they have fantastically fleshed out maps and co-driver calls. However, when I crash in the Dirt Rally games, even in really bad crashes, it feels more like a slight annoyance than a bone-shattering defeat. Here in Beam, every move counts, every gear shift, every turn of the wheel, every handbrake... Because if you slam that car into anything you will feel the repercussions, and you may not even finish the course in one piece. For those interested in rally, I would recommend getting mods in the repository, as there are modders who have integrated co-driver calls into the game.
The result of the amazing physics is that if you slam a tree while rallying at 90 mph, you will be wrapped around that tree. If you lightly roll your car, you will have some dents and cosmetic damage but will be able to finish the course in one piece. 

I originally started the game with a keyboard and mouse, then I moved up to a controller, then a non-force feedback sim wheel, and then finally and force-feedback wheel called the Thrustmaster T150 Pro. Having a force-feedback wheel has given me real-life transferable skills. I was able to go from never driving a manual transmission vehicle in my life, to getting in one and being able to drive it mostly because of what I learned in BeamNG. I am a much better driver in real life than I used to be could be, all because of this game. Other simulators can give me fun, but only this game could give me those types of transferable skills.

From the custom car creation, to the modding community with amazing vehicles and maps, to the decent AI system, to the no in-app-purchases/DLC, to the scenarios, I have had a plethora of fun in this game.

My one desperate request is for rallying, along with co-driver calls to be put in the base game.

If you want a sense of purpose and linearity, rewards for doing stuff -- don't, it's a sandbox.

I love this game for what it is --a sandbox car simulator. It simulates EVERYTHING in the car, from the alternator to the goddamn tire deformity. But that's it, there's no purpose, no sense of progression nothing. It's a sandbox simulator for cars where you can do anything the physics simulation allows. The game will help you a lot if you want to:
-Learn how a car works
-Learn how to drive in real life
-Understand the parts of a car
-Understand the physics that govern a real life car

BUT if you want to get a car and do missions, have a story with progression, then bad news, it can't help you. There is a career mode but it's very experimental. As of right now, it's nothing more than a set of errands, divided in 4 skills (delivery, racing, off-roading and specialised stuff like police), where if you crash your car you have to pay a lot of money for repairs or wait a real life time limit for the insurance to fix your car for a fee. It's fun, but wears off real quick --I got to max level delivery within a day and bought a truck to haul bigger freight and earn more money, but it's more of the same.

In Freeroam you have a couple of missions but they're hardly a challenge because the AI racers are really stupid and crash all the time. The ones you race solo are also not a challenge, even if you're playing on a keyboard like I am.

All in all, I still recommend it and still play it a lot (I reached the 100 hour mark within a forthnight). Even my potato laptop runs it, with very low FPS but enough to not make it infuriating. There's a bug with the vehicle triggers for opening doors, boots, bonnets though, where they simply vanish and support couldn't help me. Probably due to my rig, but I tried on the same laptop running Zorian (linux) and the triggers worked.",1708612079,1708612079,False,3,1,0.517241358757019043,3,True,False,True

But at the same time this could be a result of my computer just having some sort of problem with one of the parts (even though I'm pretty sure that it's not after extensive research).


Specs:

ASUS GeForce RTX 2070 Super 8 GB GDDR6
Intel Core I7-9700F 3.00ghz
16gb ddr4 one stick
512 gb ssd

(yes it's a rog strix prebuilt we all have different pc's don't discriminate)


And while I'm here, STOP LEAVING BAD REVIEWS THAT SAY STUFF LIKE NO SEX OR WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT THE BAD REVIEWS, Y'ALL ARE THE DUMBEST OF THE DUMB ON PLANET EARTH. 

Ps: I know that this game still stands at a staggering overwhelmingly positive review thing, and that every other steam game review page has these flaws, but cmon myan.

I left a review about a year or two ago which goes as the following:



THIS GAME IS AWESOME. my play time on this game is 87.1 hours, and this was the first game i got on my new PC. this game is really something because if you love destruction and realistic car physics, than this game is for you! plus there's a website that lets you add multiplayer to this. worth the money 100% (but you need a good PC to run it) i love it 10/10 WOW, in conclusion, good game.

---

2000 Km in 3 days.

Ever since NFS 1 I was dreaming about a game where we can drive in traffic. Nothing for many years (eg. Midtown Madness, NFS: Run) didn't even match NFS 1 (I didn't see Forza). Now, we can drive in traffic in this game - and it has wonderful synergy with the realistic damage model. Yes, you can immediately repair with a button when you freeroam - but when you play the garage->garage scenario, where you have a series (endless if you want) of different cars that you are tasked to move from spot to spot on the map, you have not the liberty of repair. And boy - you start to think whether you should risk the overtake or not. (And some of the cars in the traffic are even amazingly annoying - when they e.g. stop for 10 seconds, or even brake just in front of you in higher speed.)

The abovementioned scenario - it is really great when you switch cars seamlessly after each delivery & you can experience and enjoy them. Every car is different.

Which is also true for gearboxes. Newer cars let's you shift classicaly with wheel paddles (semi-automatic), a lot of ""american-like"" cars have automatic, but lo and behold: some cars have manual ...& you really drive stick here! Well, I don't have the stick per-se, so I use paddles - but this is [my] first game where you need to use clutch to shift! (Otherwise it kills the motor - sometime it just switches off, sometimes it gets damage.) Manual gearbox and swifting with paddles and cluch is sick as XXX! :)) And it is fabulous, when these three modes change randomly with the car you are getting. Sometimes you have tranquil drive in low powered automatic truck, sometimes you have old manual racer.

I realized it today BTW - that you can switch off clutch/throttle shift assistants. Without them, it is magical. IRL I already also drive automatic, but manual shifting with clutch is nice nostalgia and good challenge (that because I am used to drive exclusively left-foot-brake + right-foot-throttle... now I need to dance on the pedals a lot more :D).

There is a lot of off-road cars - and I had really amazing experience with garage->garage with off-road cars (with traffic) - I have view from hood & the delivery task starts always under the roof - I didn't know what I was driving! :D Is it a truck? Is it a big truck? (Like do I push the cars out of my way big :D?) Or small off-road cart or something? Or something hellishly overpowered? Maybe random experience (not designed like that), amazing never the less.

It works in Linux!

About that ""overpowered"" - in the above mentioned mode, you sometimes get to drive a dragster, too. The insanity & the focus you need to have not to crash it in hellish speed right away. (Dragster like car that turns normally, brakes considerably sub-par ...and accelerates to 300 Km/h in a few seconds!)

With comparison with my favorite Dirt Rally 1: in Dirt Rally I feel somewhat more what the car is doing via force feedback - there I feel whether the car wants to steer more or less via force-feedback (which e.g. greatly helps when performing Scandinavian flick & also overall). But maybe I have something wrong in my system (or game settings ...3 days, mind you :) ).

Also the simulation - the physical model seems more detailed in Dirt Rally 1 (how the car behaves in various conditions/situations), but not by much. 

What is also beautiful in BeamNG.drive is that you can tune all your cars in detail.

One more about the destruction model in BeamNG.drive: it is quite worth it to drive carefully and slowly in some spots, but as I usually do not exactly, I often stand before the challange of making the rest of the way (up to 4 Km) with damaged car. Something this is serious - missing wheel or stuck somehow. Lost focus, wrecked a buggy (both front semiaxes destroyed), totally not going forward ...but I realized it goes somewhat fine in reverse (there was some steering & I made it succesfully). Another nice experience. ... Or sometimes you just stuck with other car -> fun.

The game is a big sandbox - you can free roam on relatively big islands, even when you do a delivery in garage->garage & it is an interesting car, you can take it for a ride anywhere. But like - can you not wreck it completely while wandering, so you can finally deliver at the end? :D

It looks that the game is modable. Like very modable. I was not researching outside, but the game allows you to download many different things from repository - which look like made by community and not developers. This includes even whole islands! New cars, new settings for probably everything including car tunings, new challenges. There is some community mod - scenario that was saying something about different traffic & which was throwing LUA errors. Seeing LUA being used in a game is always a good sign. ;) Can you script how traffic will behave? That is bordering insane! :) Like this is my wet dream - doing research how people behave in real traffic in critical situations & then put it into computer simulator where players will be able to experience that. Learn how to drive to avoid collisions with cars that are really behaving like people do. ;)

& I heard there is multiplayer, too! :)

What I saw here in my 2 Mm is ""insanely good"" and worth for me 100 EUR and more. :) Also it is still in development - so it is bound to improve still.

Rating: ★★★★★

BeamNG.drive, developed by BeamNG GmbH, stands as a testament to the pinnacle of vehicular simulation and sandbox gaming. From realistic crash physics to the sheer breadth of customization and open-world exploration, this game offers a one-of-a-kind experience that caters to both simulation enthusiasts and casual gamers alike.

The driving physics in BeamNG.drive are unparalleled, setting a new standard for realism in the genre. Every vehicle reacts dynamically to terrain, weight distribution, and impact forces, providing an incredibly immersive and authentic driving experience. The attention to detail in the physics engine allows for a wide range of vehicles, from sedans to trucks, to handle with precision and nuance.

The game's sandbox mode is a playground for automotive enthusiasts, offering an expansive open world with diverse terrains to explore. Whether you're cruising down highways, tackling off-road trails, or simply pushing your vehicle to its limits on the test track, the freedom to experiment and push the boundaries is at the core of BeamNG.drive's appeal.

One of the standout features is the realistic damage modeling. Collisions are not just cosmetic; they impact the vehicle's functionality in a true-to-life manner. Witnessing your car crumple and deform in response to crashes is both awe-inspiring and a testament to the game's commitment to authenticity.

BeamNG.drive also boasts an active and passionate modding community, contributing a wealth of user-generated content. From new vehicles and maps to gameplay enhancements, the modding scene significantly expands the game's already extensive content and adds to its replay value.

The vehicle customization options are comprehensive, allowing players to tweak and fine-tune every aspect of their cars, from engine performance to aesthetic details. This level of control empowers players to create unique vehicles tailored to their preferences and experiment with various configurations.

While the lack of a structured career or mission mode might be considered a drawback for those seeking a more guided experience, the open-ended nature of BeamNG.drive encourages creativity and self-driven exploration.

In conclusion, BeamNG.drive is a triumph in vehicular simulation, offering an unrivaled level of realism and freedom for players to explore, experiment, and enjoy the intricacies of driving. Whether you're a dedicated simulation enthusiast or simply someone looking for an engaging and visually stunning sandbox experience, BeamNG.drive is a must-play title that delivers on its promise of realistic, dynamic, and endlessly entertaining vehicular mayhem.",1708474121,1708474121,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Although it can be a little annoying to navigate, it isn't bad. Next, the physics, especially for cars, is amazing. The cars have very good soft body physics and crashes are really fun to make. The physics of trucks are really good, too. Another thing that I love about this game is that the graphics look amazing. The cars are very detailed and nice looking. The interiors are amazing. My only concern about this game is the pc someone would need to play this game. I play on 8 gb of ram, and I can play the game with good graphics, but at the cost of less vehicle, and not as big trucks and buses.

TLDR: This game has good graphics, features, and physics. Please read the minimum pecs before buying, just in case. I totally recommend it!",1676667039,1708376142,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

in real honesty: this simulates everything you would not expect it to. it's not just a basic hold w to go and hold s to slow down faster. everything from the engine to the thermals are simulated.
the whole destruction aspect adds [i][b]A LOT of spice[/b][/i] to it and i just love it.

bought it on 26th of november, and since then i've been just playing this everyday non-stop just mindlessly driving around, crashing cars and so on...

go on, buy beamng NOW. as long you have 46GB of space. (maps and cars seem to be in gigabytes for some reason but trust me it's worth it if you really love cars as much as i do)

However I would like to see some major improvements or addition to it's physics engine. 
Specifically, I am talking about 
1. Car tires.
They are too stretchable and way too polygonal to look breaking the rolling feel when viewing closely (also the car rattles around when going slowly).
2. Vehicle paint damage.
There are no scratches nor can dirt stick to the car and its paint. If you asked me what I wanted more, probably the scratches would be cooler. (After a crash, the car shouldn't only bend its panels, but there should be some deep scratches left on the panels too).
3. More engine parts.
If you open the hood and look it, most of the cars' engines look great but once you crash them, all the engine components are almost like one big piece, and you know when a car crashes in Real Life many components go flying all around, this is what would make a difference, and lastly
4. The engine could make some noises when damaged, like if there's a minor crash where the crumple zone would get to the radiator, the radiator could start making some clicking noises of the fan blades touching for example. There are many options.

• Awesome car physics considering how suspension behaves over any terrain, competes with snowrunner and games like that. 

• Great Soft Body Crash Physics. 

• Great scope for mods and tweaking car parts. 

Cons;

• Once I was driving a semi and it had to pass under some kind of banner, The banner was sooo strong that it ploughed the whole cab out of the semi like what's happening?! 🤣 The game lacks destruction physics, it absolutely make no sense. 

• Looks S_H_I_T on 1080p as it's full of jagged edges, not everyone has 4090 to render on 4K.

• Lags upon spawning traffic and at certain places of ingame map even on normal settings having exceeding gpu and cpu listed requirements. 

• Reflection on glass and mirrors stutters. 

• Don't know why but the style of graphics it is built into S_U_C_K_S.

• Definitely not for LAPTOPS and mid range PCs  the developer should set higher reccomended system requirements as it's barely enough to run the game and forget about spawning traffic vehicles which's advertised in the video, You at least need 3060 or higher to enjoy the game to the core, it's not like forza Or nfs that offers you the option to compromise on graphics to gain performance. 

• Should support DLSS if fps get low upon spawning vehicles as it's gpu bottlenecked despite having great cpu. 

(Overall in conclusion, these were my perspective about the game and i regret buying it. It's gameplay and overall experience is too dull to be demanding this heavy. Admitted that it has to deal with lots and lots of complex calculations but these alone make it too heavy to do anything for a mid range hardware).",1703580266,1708194316,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Currently it feels like a car crash simulator with a bad user interface, rather mediocre graphics, not-so-great performance, some bugs, and nothing really to do. The hand drawn mini cut scenes in the mini campaigns are awful, and the tasks are, sorry, just stupid.

Sure, driving a car down a cliff and watching the damage model deform it is fun 3 times, maybe 5 times. But what then? The damage model may be great, but the driving does not feel great, neither in a rally car on gravel, nor in a race car on tarmac. I wouldn't mind the current state if it was in early access for half a year, but it's been quite a while. And even though updates  are coming regularly, it seems to me like it would take them ages to turn this into a polished product.

Yes, there are a ton of mods which mainly add more cars (obviously you are not allowed to add licensed/real ones), but they do not solve the problem: it's not that it lacks cars. Also some of the more interesting mods I found referenced on the internet (e.g., adding real race tracks like Nürburgring) seem to be gone by now, maybe because their authors did not update them or for copyright reasons since they were taken from other games, I do not know.

To be honest I expected something [i]a lot[/i] better from the reviews here on Steam. I guess people just like crashing cars a lot more than properly driving them?

EDIT: To be fair, I also need to mention something positive. What I really like in the game is driving the 4WD cars with high suspension offroad, e.g., on the figure eight dirt track, or in freeroam mode on the Italy map. You can properly switch between 2WD mode, 4WD high, 4WD low, and separately lock/unlock the front and read differentials, which allows for some great hill climbing. The environment and surface simulation is good but not overly realistic, e.g., you can just drive into the soft sand on the beach with full tire pressure in 2WD mode, stop, then floor it in M1 gear, and be fine instead of sinking into the sand in any way. or to put it another way: the environment affects your car, but not the other way around (no sand or rocks move, only your car does). But overall it's fun.

EDIT2: There are some good mods out there, and nice maps for rock crawling and drifting. I hate drifting and I'm not that much of a rock crawler, but you will like the game if you're into one of these. If you get this game, be prepared to spend some time on finding the mods you want to play. The base game is not gonna cut it.

The base game, while limited, still offers an extremely wide variety of vehicles, customizations, tests, missions, etc and the terrains are even better. The developers, ""BeamNG"" are extremely active in updating the game with new features and support, as-well as following a very thorough regiment of patches and Beam has always been very active with the community itself unlike very many other titles which seem to presently follow the ""cashgrab"" ideology. It is still in Early Access and over time I have clocked 4370 hours (check my profile, its true) on this game so I am very very excited to see where this game goes in the future! Being the very first game I personally installed, I have watched it evolve from a simple soft body physics engine with a small map and even smaller fan-base, I have nothing but respect for the developer having transformed that into what it is today! The engine it runs on is one of, if not the, most impressive soft body physics based system I have ever seen. Dynamic nodes that respond not only to impact but also have physical properties themselves such as weight distribution, tensile strength, and very well coded positioning. One topic I always touch on is the modding community and need I even mention it? Not only is there an extremely active modding community, but with that, the developers make every tool and asset necessary readily available! Now, as I mentioned previously, I have clocked quite a few hours in this game, and only have one TINY concern that doesn't affect play-ability or my gaming experience in any way shape or form which is the tires. I'm sure a lot of players know if you hold left Ctrl you can grab individual nodes on the vehicles themselves, some of which being the tires. If you rip them apart the wrong way, they will stretch across the screen and be a bit of a nuisance. Im sure its a very complicated issue that will be sorted and I recommend that the soft physics of the tires being limited to punctures and dynamic nodes that disconnect from the wheels themselves like a bead on a real tire but the concern is only because of it being a slight annoyance.. After clocking thousands of hours in a game and having only one small issue, this is most certainly a very very impressive title and I will definitely be sticking around until the release and later. Thanks a bunch Beam for creating such a vastly immersive and almost addicting game! 10/10 -W.G",1708050514,1708050514,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Also the maps are very big meaning even on 32 GB you have to lower your graphics to even load them, and sometimes even when you do it still crashes after adding one car that isn't the base one.

BeamNG.drive, not a mere racing simulator, but a physics symphony. Its soft-body consequences ripple like echoes across the ages. The aerodynamics, a dance of celestial equations, rival the very heavens. When you grip the wheel, you’re not steering; you’re weaving fate. Forza trembles, Spin-Tyres bows, and BeamNG stands unyielding.

Picture this, weary traveler: You, ensconced in your digital cockpit, hurtling through pixelated landscapes. The crunch of metal, the ballet of destruction—it’s more than a crash; it’s a cosmic sonnet. The cars, like fallen gods, twist and crumple. Each collision, a verse in the hymn of entropy. And when you emerge, dust-kissed and exhilarated, you’ve glimpsed eternity.

Beneath the hood lies arcane knowledge. Differentials whisper secrets, anti-lock brakes hum forgotten ballads, and tacky air-intake systems beckon. Imagine sharing this wisdom with acne-ridden souls named Darren. They crash, they learn, and in the wreckage, they find solace. BeamNG is their oracle, their vehicular enlightenment.

Not a tech-demo, but a cosmic carnival. It’s more than circuits and polygons; it’s dreams materialized. Bovril, a mystery to some, yet its essence seeps into every pixel. The hours vanish, the steering wheel becomes an artifact, and you—the Unkindled—embrace the spectacle. For in BeamNG, you’re not a player; you’re a weaver of legends.

Maybe MP is where it's at? I play most things online, but didn't even try Beam MP because I just don't like the driving, to be honest about it. Still shocking how I am so far off everyone else.

This game is also very fun and using mods it allows you to play with your friends in a server using all your custom vehicles and normal vehicles that either came with the game or you downloaded off the internet.

Please note that I play BeamNG.drive on a wheel, my G923, with force feedback and trueforce enabled of course.
Where should I even start?

[h2] The crashes [/h2]
This is pretty much what everybody knows BeamNG for; Its crash simulation. Yet, this game isn't only a crash simulator, there is way more to it. But the crashes are pretty much what you see it the videos. Tyres can pop, the hood can come off, headlights can break, I forget to press the clutch and grind my gears until they are completely broken, you know.

[h2] The Things You Drive [/h2]
Or, The Cars. If you didn't know for some reason, BeamNG.drive doesn't have licensed cars. Instead, we have cars like the Ibishu Pigeon and Civetta Bolide. The cars are detailed, most have openable doors, hoods and trunks. The car amount isn't very mind-blowing when there's games with more than 500 cars, standing at 36 cars (0.31), though there are many configurations of each car.

[h2] The Things You Drive On [/h2]
Or, The Maps. BeamNG.drive has 15 different maps. All of them are detailed and most are fun to explore in my opinion. Some of the most fun I've had playing this game (and I'm not kidding) was from driving around with no direction in West Coast USA.
The map I liked the most was either West Coast USA or Italy. 

[h2] The Things That Make Your Steering Wheel Turn By Itself [/h2]
Or in other words, The Force Feedback/Vibration. I don't really have anything to say about the vibration with a controller, since I have always played with a wheel. The Force Feedback with a wheel is a bit different than with other games, at least in my opinion. The force feedback sometimes is smooth, but most times it feels like its trying to vibrate the steering wheel instead of turning it, at least it sounds like it. (This is my experience though, yours might be different.)

[h2] The Things You Can Do [/h2]
There's a lot of stuff to do in BeamNG.drive, and I mean a Lot. There's scenarios, kind of like missions you can complete (its in the name), there's campaigns, which are like a career modes but short (and they don't save for some reason), there's light runner, where you can drive in the sky in weird tracks and hope to not fall off, there's time trials, you probably know what those are, there's the garage, where you can look at your car, there's the bus routes, where you can imagine you are playing a bus simulator, there's the track builder, where you can build tracks and then there is the career mode, which at the time of writing this, is coming soon. And then there also is the button I probably used the most, Freeroam. Basically it lets you drive freely in the maps and mess around. [b] You can even spawn traffic, which is fun to drive with. [/b]

[h2] The Things You Hear [/h2]
Or, The Sounds and The Soundtrack. Yeah, no, BeamNG.drive doesn't have soundtrack. Except for a lightrunner, which has it's own music. The car sounds are pretty good, the cars even have sounds for opening doors.

[h2] The Things You Get Free Content With [/h2]
Or, The Free Updates. BeamNG.drive was released to steam on the 29 of march in 2015, and it still gets free updates. Stuff like this is very rare, since most racing games just get a sequel and then another and another, but BeamNG is still getting free updates, without any DLC.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
BeamNG.drive is a massive game which is constantly being improved with free update and content. It also has mod support with an in-game repository to download mods from. BeamNG.drive will be even better when the career mode is finished, if it is good. For now, I would give BeamNG.drive a [b] 9/10 [/b]. Now that you have read this review, I recommend you to read other reviews too, because most of this review was just my own opinion. Thank you.",1700762361,1707588223,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Its physics are cool and the graphics are good. 

The UI is terrible. It is un-intuitive which makes it difficult to navigate. For example, if there is a way to do specific ""missions"" within the campaigns, I haven't found it yet. If there isn't then that is also bad. I shouldn't have to do 7 missions to get to the one I want.

Using a controller or the keyboard is pain. Apparently you really should have a wheel which I dont recall seeing in the game description. I'm not looking for NFS arcade stuff but I think a controller shouldnt be so difficult to use. 

Finally there is next to nothing to actually do outside of campaigns and time trials. Maybe its me but crashing cars over and over loses its appeal fast. There is a ""work in progress"" career mode that is also pain. If you fender bender your car it will take rel time to fix it. In a game where crashing is a huge chunk of what you do, that is a problem. Its a sandbox and while that floats some peoples boats, it doesn't float mine. I don't play games for memes and am frankly not creative or patient enough to deal with the tedious track builder.

Its got the bones of a game but not the flesh. Right now I cant recommend this game even at its modest price point. There is simply not enough there. I'm sure mods help but devs shouldnt rely on modders to make their game passable.

Pros:
- car physics
- a lot of maps
- a lot of cars
- very fun
- very good mod support
- it's very fun to just cruise around and do nothing, whereas in other games like Nfs you just go from race to race and don't take in the scenery and actually explore the map
- very frequent updates (and they're big too)
- it's also very good with a steering wheel

Cons:
- nothing except the game has been around for a long time and it's still in early access

Things I would like to see:
- first of all : multiplayer. I don't even need to say a thing about this.
- car scratches. The damage model is very good but there are no scratches or dirt on the car from going offroad
- weather
- graphics and performance improvements
- a UI that doesn't run at 2 fps (even the spedometer is so choppy)
- more controller support
- career mode being expanded
- better particle system

The game is very good and very fun. One of the best and most fun sims of all time.",1707421524,1707498966,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

With a sandbox environment, and soft-body physics simulation, there's a lot of freedom to explore and be creative. Multiplayer and mod support add a ton of replay-ability. I've easily put 1000 hours in single player and probably twice as much in multiplayer.

Some of the obvious possibilities in BeamNG are: racing, rally, drifting, drag, off-roading, rock crawling, and crashing :)",1707461095,1707461710,True,1,0,0.504950463771820068,0,True,False,True

Then agian its hard to have fun in a game that you have over 1400 hours almost 1500 so ya. Great grphics but you need a crazy computer to play. I mean I have a Nividia 2070 super, 16GBs of memory, and a AMD Ryzen 2700X Eight-Core but even then the game lags and my computer catches fire. But overall great damage, phiysics, and AI, a game that was combined whit eamng and teardon would be the ultimate destruction game. also if you are looking for and offroad game then get snowrunner becuase beamng doesnt have the best offroading. But still I love this game.

Edit 1: I think that the 2070 super is pretty good. I also am planning on getting more memory so there you go.

This is one of the all time best games for racing, drifting, offroading, or just having fun and destroying things. The game is never dull or boring, and if at some point you do get bored, there is always the mods menu which gives you something new and enjoyable to play with.

On a performance perspective it could use a little work, i have now upgraded to a 13th gen i5, 4050, and 32gb of ram and still run into frame drops, i run on high settings get an average of 50-60 fps, you should not purchase this game if your rocking less than 16gb of ram or have integrated graphics and want a truly playable experience.",1599761683,1706850390,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

BeamNG.drive is a vehicle simulation video game developed and published by Bremen-based video game developer BeamNG.

        [th]Description[/th]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]The graphics are actually pretty good for an early access game from 2015. The developers are also revamping the maps so that's a great thing to see for this game. The cars have really nice interiors as well. I have no complaints with the graphics for this game, especially one made in 2015.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]BeamNG.drive is a total sandbox. You can create scenarios, and also challenge yourself by completing some difficult missions made by the developers. You have many cars with many variants of that car as well. Also the tracks are really nice and you have a good amount of them as well. This game does have mod support so that’s a huge plus. You also have multiplayer, but it can be kinda tricky to set up, but you can get it down if you take some time on it. You do get regular patches and sometimes even big updates with free cars and maps. The physics in this game are incredible. The damage model is pure addition. Going offroad feels absolutely incredible. You can search up many realistic crash compilations and they look pretty impressive. If you are looking for a game to mess around in and crash and test the physics, you have to get this game.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]With mod support and the unlimited potential and scenarios you can create, it’s impossible to put a playtime on this game. If you enjoy physics based games and enjoy seeing crashes (or just love a car game with good physics and damage model), you found the dream game and you will put a ton of hours here.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design is pretty average I must say. The cars sound pretty bland (compared to other racing/car games). Not much to say here. Hopefully they improve the engine sounds soon and make them better. It’s not horrible, just average.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]You will encounter some issues. Camera can get kinda buggy if you switch too fast too many times, I had a few crashes and lockups but pretty rare.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The performance is pretty good. I still feel like they can improve it in some areas. I can play on High settings fine but on max settings is where you may have some problems if you have multiple vehicles on scene.[/td]
    [/tr]

    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🏆Rating[/td]
        [td]8/10
I would say this game is worth full price. With the mod support and sandox design, you can get your money’s worth easily.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]This game has been getting better and better with age. With the improvements on the driving physics and added content. This game is just impressing me every update. This is a must buy for any car guy or anyone interesting in physics based games.[/td]

**Creamy Chicken Alfredo Pasta**

**Ingredients:**

- 8 oz (about 225g) fettuccine pasta
- 1 lb (about 450g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs (optional)
- Chopped fresh parsley for garnish

**Instructions:**

1. Cook the fettuccine pasta according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.

2. Season the chicken pieces with salt and black pepper to taste.

3. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the seasoned chicken and cook until browned and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.

4. In the same skillet, add minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant.

5. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and add the heavy cream, butter, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, and dried Italian herbs (if using). Stir continuously until the cheeses melt and the sauce is smooth and creamy.

6. Add the cooked chicken back to the skillet, stirring to combine. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat the chicken through.

7. Toss the cooked fettuccine pasta into the creamy Alfredo sauce, ensuring it is well coated.

8. Season with additional salt and black pepper if needed. 

9. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.

10. Serve immediately, and enjoy your super creamy and cheesy Chicken Alfredo Pasta!

Rating: 1/5 Stars

I feel compelled to express my overwhelming disappointment and sheer frustration with BeamNG.drive. From the outset, this game seemed promising, with its touted realistic physics and detailed vehicle damage modeling. However, my experience has been nothing short of infuriating.

Let's start with the controls—utterly abysmal. Maneuvering vehicles in this game is like trying to herd cats on roller skates. The sensitivity is through the roof, and the lack of responsiveness turns every attempt at precision driving into a chaotic mess. Whoever designed the control scheme must have taken sadistic pleasure in watching players struggle.

And what's with the lack of a decent tutorial? I found myself thrust into a world of confusion, attempting to decipher the game mechanics with no guidance whatsoever. Trial and error may work for some, but not for those of us who value our time and sanity.

The graphics, touted as a highlight, are a mixed bag. Sure, the vehicle models are detailed, but the environments are lackluster and uninspiring. The overall visual experience left me wondering if I had somehow transported back to the early 2000s.

Now, let's address the so-called ""realistic physics."" Realistic for what, a bizarro world where cars behave like drunk turtles on ice? The collisions, touted as the game's main attraction, are nothing more than a clumsy spectacle. There's a thin line between realistic physics and a carnival sideshow, and BeamNG.drive crosses it with flying colors.

The complete lack of engaging content is the final nail in the coffin. The scenarios and missions are as dull as dishwater, providing little motivation to endure the aggravation of the gameplay.

In conclusion, BeamNG.drive is a textbook example of a game that over-promises and under-delivers. It's a frustrating, time-wasting exercise in patience, and I cannot, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone seeking an enjoyable gaming experience. Save yourself the headache and invest your time and money elsewhere.",1706580760,1706580760,False,1,0,0.477631598711013794,2,True,False,True

[b]Introduction[/b]

As an avid sim racing enthusiast with an insatiable appetite for realistic driving experiences, I find myself inexorably drawn to BeamNG.drive. With over 1500 hours invested in the game, I can confidently attest to its exceptional depth, realism, and captivating gameplay that transcends the boundaries of traditional racing games. In this review, I'll delve into the myriad facets that make BeamNG.drive a true gem in the world of simulation gaming.

[b]Wheel Compatibility & Realism[/b]

One of the prime indicators of a serious driving simulator is its compatibility with high-end peripherals, and BeamNG.drive excels in this aspect. My setup, consisting of a Fanatec CSL DD 8NM Wheelbase, Fanatec Shifter, Handbrake, and Clubsport inverted pedals, integrates seamlessly with the game. The finely tuned force feedback allows for an unprecedented level of sensitivity, translating the intricacies of the road directly to my fingertips.

[b]CPU and GPU Stress & Performance[/b]

BeamNG.drive is renowned for pushing hardware to its limits, and rightfully so. The advanced physics engine is a double-edged sword—while it crafts unparalleled realism, it also taxes CPUs and GPUs. Nevertheless, the feeling of conquering the performance demands and witnessing the game's breathtaking physics simulations is immensely rewarding. Across different maps and scenarios, my system occasionally faces its share of challenges, but the immersive experience is well worth the occasional performance adjustments.

[b]FPS Variability & Map Diversity[/b]

The framerate experience is varied, as different maps, vehicles, and crash scenarios can significantly impact performance. Some complex crash simulations might lead to temporary drops in FPS, but this lends credence to the authenticity of the game's physics engine. Exploring the array of maps, each with its unique challenges and terrain, contributes to the game's replayability and keeps every session fresh.

[b]Developer Involvement & Updates[/b]

BeamNG.drive is not just a game; it's a labor of love from dedicated developers who consistently raise the bar. The transparency and active engagement of the developers with the community is truly commendable. Frequent updates bring new content, optimization, and bug fixes, reaffirming the developers' commitment to providing a refined experience. It's evident that their passion is the driving force behind the game's evolution.

[b]Modding Marvel & Extended Longevity[/b]

The game's vibrant modding community is an indispensable aspect of its allure. Countless user-generated vehicles, maps, and scenarios expand the horizons of gameplay, breathing new life into each session. This symbiotic relationship between developers and modders ensures that the game maintains a constant influx of creativity and innovation, bolstering its longevity.

[b]Physics, Crashes, and Realism[/b]

BeamNG.drive's physics engine is unparalleled, serving as the bedrock of its realism. Vehicle dynamics respond authentically to terrain and input, while the collision system captures crashes with astounding detail. Witnessing my meticulously crafted vehicle crumple in slow motion after an intense collision is simultaneously painful and mesmerizing—an epitome of the game's commitment to realism.

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]

In a gaming landscape dominated by conventional racers, BeamNG.drive stands as an exceptional outlier, offering a sandbox of vehicular exploration, realism, and creativity. With over 1600 hours invested, my journey through the game has been nothing short of enthralling. From the astonishing physics to the awe-inspiring crashes and the captivating modding scene, BeamNG.drive reignites my passion for virtual driving every time I fire it up.

BeamNG is built different, somehow it's earned a reputation as a simple collision simulator but it is so, so much more. The collisions are just one aspect of an insanely accurate physics engine that serves as the foundation for everything in the sandbox. It says something about the quality of the code here when BeamNG.drive has a sibling called BeamNG.tech, which is licensed to educational establishments and private companies for use in the development of autonomous vehicles and automatic driver assist systems.

So much love has been poured into this game. It's not an exaggeration to say I've had 20x the value out of BeamNG compared to AAA titles that cost 3x as much. It's not a game that relies on 'content' to keep the player engaged (though there is plenty of it), it's more of a sensory experience. I can drive for hours in a semi-meditative trance while enjoying every bend and bump. Every vehicle feels so characterful and unique - plus it literally does trucks so much better than Euro Truck Simulator almost by accident. And there are so many inspired features buried within the menus that after hundreds of hours I still find stuff that makes me say ""no way!""

Just buy it, buy it twice! I buy it for friends when I get the chance. All I can say is that I'd like to meet some of the negative reviewers IRL and find out who hurt them, because I honestly don't know how someone could have the gall to give BeamNG a bad review. In fact, I'm getting me a BeamNG tattoo.

PS. check out the BeamMP mod for online multiplayer, works great and an amazing community. Also as of writing some of the videos of the game on it's steam page show very dated footage from years ago.

I love the police chases in this game and the hood cam makes it feel so realistic and it is very fun to mess around with mods and the AI. The anti-aliasing is absolutely horrendous though not gonna lie. Also the traction is quite unrealistic cause you kinda slide everywhere so you have to know the car well, although there is a mod called ""ExtraGrip"" that fixes this issue just fine so there is no big deal there.

Great Community for mods and user creations 

well put together game-made maps as well as user submitted maps

The cars are stripped down to each part which gives the user a wide variety of customization 

The BeamMP (multiplayer) feature gives the game a whole different aspect being able to race against other players and get into intense car chases.

Constant updates/patches gives the game a fresh look so you never get bored of the same content over and over again. 

Cons:
Steering and Handling are iffy in certain cars, Not as realistic as other Simulation Games like Asseto, BeamNG focuses rather on physics and game play than car handling. (IMO) 

Depending on your PC, the game takes a buttload of RAM and GPU power to maximize the full potential of the game, Not really the game's fault but more User Limitation. 

Modded Cars in Multiplayer (Supposedly there is a way to change the aspects of a car within the directory files which makes the car stupid fast which also causes users to lag and makes the server messy, Supposedly....) This just makes servers look sloppy and unprofessional when a cargo van is going 350 MPH down the freeway

In AC you don't have the freedom to exit your vehicle, catch it on fire, or even open the doors. BeamNG.Drive is the most advanced vehicle simulator to ever hit the market. I first played BeamNG when it first came out (A free version off the internet) I was only 7 years old and I loved it. I found this game again when they started to polish it up and it's insane how far the game has come. 12 years later this is still the best vehicle simulator for physics, soft body aspects, and overall simulatory aspects.

Intrigued by my Summer Car but don't want any of that grind with engines and instead drive? Yes this is for you. Interested in different setups for a car model or interested in particular real life car models on how they look like / break apart as a soft physics model in the sim? This is for you. 

Lots of mods in form of tracks, car models and different setups and kits for said cars. Mod scene is weird, i see lots of passionate talk about level of quality on mods and how realistic some models look or don't look.  If none of this interests you then consider again. Quality of course varies but there is lot of the stuff. 

This game replaces nothing on the existing racing game scene, it instead occupies it's own niche slot and because of that i recommend getting it pretty openly to many but it requires at least rudimentary interest in messing around with cars and spending time checking out scenarios and mods and just spending time with the product to unlock it's potential. Devs have included some campaigns for achievements and scenarios and there is good support for wheels (Driving is nice with game pad too) but it's obvious the first requirement from the player is interest into the various topics presented in the game and spending time to find the fun parts. Nothing is served on a force fed silver plate. You choose what you want to do.

All in all a good product. Get it if you find yourself intrigued and have enough time and interest to explore.  Do not be scared of the Early Access tag.

You might just think it simulates crashing but it simulates a lot more like: very good suspension, engine over heating and more or less gravity

Track builder
You can make your own track and make ramps, bumps, banked turns, loops, and a lot more. 

types of driving
You can do mouse stearing, or just press buttons, you can do automatic transmission or manual and you can change a lot more settings.

Types of cars: 
SUVs, sedans, pickup trucks, mini vans, race cars, tow trucks, full size vans, buses, and sport cars.

AI cars
you can race AI and crash them out of the race or ask them to follow you.

cons: you need a fast computer or it is laggy.
no brand names.

Very good, but sometimes feels like it lacks basic ideals, like for example: 

Why can't I spawn a tractor trailer without hitching the trailer?

Why can't I use the pull menu without moving my vehicle or opening alternate menus?

However, the initial excitement tends to fizzle out after just a couple of hours, leaving players looking for reasons to stick around.

While the game aims for realism in its graphics, the visuals fall a bit short in terms of keeping you engaged. The environments lack the detailed touch found in other games, and despite the attempt at realism, they might not hold your interest for the long haul.

One of the game's highlights is its commitment to lifelike physics, providing a genuine driving feel. Yet, this feature, unfortunately, doesn't translate into sustained enjoyment. The lack of structured missions or incentives becomes apparent, making the open-world environment lose its charm rather quickly.

The controls, while adding to the realistic vibe, can be a bit challenging for newcomers. This authenticity, however, might turn into a hurdle, potentially causing frustration instead of enjoyment.

Despite the expansive open-world setting, the absence of compelling content becomes noticeable after a brief playthrough. The dearth of missions or progression systems leaves you without a clear goal, resulting in a somewhat monotonous experience.

While the variety in the vehicle selection is a plus, the limited customization options and overall lack of content might leave you wanting more. If you're interested, it might be worth considering picking up BeamNG.drive on sale – it's a short-lived taste of realism that could be enjoyable for a brief period, especially for driving enthusiasts.",1705710490,1705734438,False,4,0,0.490241408348083496,0,True,False,True

Evokes a sweet nostalgia for Midtown Madness and World Racing, especially the latter. Provides a stellar driving experience along a very wide spectrum. Exploring only 1% of the game can provide dozens of hours of nuanced play. Extracting more requires autonomy, exploration, experimentation, creativity, knowledge and skill.

Building your own variants for different applications, tuning them and putting them to the test under various conditions is a dream come true. As a lifelong sim racer, most of my time in this game is spent doing time trials so this aspect of the game is truly mind blowing.
But I must admit that I am shocked at how many hours I've spent doing bus routes as well. I very much enjoy the fact that I can switch from intensely furious racing to soothing and relaxing driving. 

Learning to use the World Editor and the various sub-editors within to create your own challenges is difficult and confusing at the beginning but it is a part of the natural progression. It requires a lot of patience, testing and exploration of the directory's file and folder structure but when learned, it becomes easy to use and considerably widens the scope of possibilities. Bus lines, AI races and time trials are by far the most exciting.

Racing sims have this rare quality of being pure and devoid of trivial distractions or superficialities. They are in a category of their own. Some are almost eternal. BeamNG may not be quite as pure and well oriented as truer racing sims, but it comes very close to providing that same feeling of driving on a knife edge, with the car unstable and the engine roaring magnificently. And with the freedom and range of operation that it offers...WOW...

Beamng is totally ruined for me now plus all the bugs and glitches added are beyond annoying. i make youtube videos on beamng and my mods but because of this update i cant continue making these videos. Thanks alot for ruining my favorite game and future youtube videos.

Edit its been a few updates and even with no mods installed half the vanilla cars are broken and a few of the maps wont load. what are you devs doing? your just breaking and ruining the game. why not finish the career mod instead of adding pointless stupid looking new vehicles and breaking the already functioning parts of your game. this use to be my #1 favorite game and now i never play it because half of it is non functional.

Edit again. i spent hours getting everything to work again and nowi cant play the game at all. i get constant freezes and stutters in 1080p lowest settings. i use to play in 4k ultra and it was glass smooth. what are the devs even doing? the last 4-5 updates have done nothing but break the game and make it unplayable for me but theres no way to roll back to a version that still works. why have you ruined my favorite game?

The tire selection is TERRIBLE. were talking maybe 2 options per rim, some have tons, others have 1-2. The inconsistency's in this game are what piss me off, its supposed to be a vehicle sim but its lacking looooads of common things. The truck has barely any motor options, and the inline 6 can only have a carb, no efi? no v6 options or eco boost options, no 5.0L, no 5.3, no 6.0(gas), no 5.7. Also no turbos for truck engines? just superchargers? like whyyyy. People will tell you ""just get mods"" but they suck and they barely work. Most engine mods hang out of the vehicle and break the drive shaft immediately. They recently had a transport update, but I've never seen anyone use that thing. The game needed other updates waaaay before that useless transport update. Which is still lacking big rig stuff. Plus you cant even haul any vehicles around with it bugging out, or meshing into your vehicle then it flys across the map because its bugging out. It's good, but its been stale for a long time.

These is miles ahead of anything even remotely trying. Mods galore, consistent and feature/Content packed updates, and a true passion project from the dev team. I will continue to spend countless hours of my life in this, and will always continue support to the devs.

Yes, the crash physics are the main appeal, but they add an element of difficulty that no other Sim-Racer can compete with: True level mechanical damage. Once you start realizing how delicate racing a car can be, it really changes your driving style to be more precise and careful when you're doing the races on the free-roam maps. 

I find myself having to restart a race multiple times before I can cross the finish line, but instead of getting frustrated with having to restart the race every time, I am always in awe at the damage models of the cars every time I wreck, most of the time on purpose. This level of detail will never be matched by any games with licensed cars, as that's a big no-no from a marketing perspective for many car brands.

Fortunately, BeamNG really has a fantastic modding community that only gets bigger with each passing day that more people find out about this game. If you're looking to get started with crashing various real world cars, you can check out the newly established BeamMods dot com, which also includes leaked paid mods as well.

A few years ago, I remember seeing somewhere that the Devs said it would be impossible to have this game running on multiplayer because of all the crash data it has to send across the servers. Today, you can download BeamMP and this dream suddenly becomes a wonderful reality. I love the fact that you can also drive your modded cars on these servers and if you and your friend have the same mod files installed, you can see each others cars in game. 

Overall, I cannot recommend this game enough for anyone who is curious about what BeamNG.drive is all about. Even if you're not a racing fan or car person, I guarantee there's atleast several hours of fun here to be had just fiddling around with the different cars physics and crash models. 

I have way more time in game than Steam shows because launching the game through the BeamMP Launcher does not show on Steam for some reason.",1705463305,1705463305,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Think Burnout Paradise, but with mega-enhanced physics that cause some of the most fun crashes you can get in a videogame",1705340451,1705340451,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Insanely detailled crashes and physics.

I use just a small amount of mods like the Nürburgring Map, which is a port from Assetto Corsa, or the Spa circuit.

There is actually a mod for playing this game in multiplayer but I haven't tried that out yet.

The support of the BeamNG Team is kind and helps you ASAP. I had problems with the game crashing very often but they helped me out fast and it never crashed after them helping me!

Pros:
- Very detailled cars

- A lot of fun settings, such as changing the gravity to the Moon's gravity, 

- VR Support (At this point the VR Support is relativly new and not completly stable yet)

- 20,99€ (15.01.2024) is a very good price for a game in which you can spend hundreds to thousands of hours

- Big Updates every now and then

- Mod Community and the big selection of mods you can download

- Polite and fast support team

- You can change many parts of your car. For example easily do an engine swap or transform a generic street car into an insane sleeper

Cons:
- Some of the maps feel dried out and loveless because of their vegitation, emptiness and flying trees every now and then

- Many progams cause trouble with this game and need to be uninstalled or closed before starting BeamNG.drive
Check the official Homepage of the game for a proper list of ""unsupported"" software.
https://documentation.beamng.com/support/troubleshooting/incompatible_software/

- You'll need a Mid-High End PC for playing this game properly.
My specs at the moment are i7 9700k, RTX3080, 32GB 3200MHz DDR4 RAM and QHD. I get an average of 80-90 FPS without spawning traffic. If you spawn traffic or different objects, this will affect your FPS heavily.

-------

Conclusion:

If you like sandbox games and car games: THIS IS A MUST HAVE!
If you're searching for a realistic sim racer: This should not be your game of choice. No mutliplayer without mods and not even slipstream without mods.

Before you buy this game, check the list of incompatible software from the homepage (see above) and figure out if it's worth for you to probably uninstall some software to play this game.
Also check your PC and Display-Specs to see if you can run this game with a view spawned vehicles.
This game is btw. also worth for achievement grinders/completionists, because it takes you about an hour to get all four achievements.

If there is something I missed or something that I'm wrong with/that got updated, you can leave it in the comments and I will try to edit my review asap.",1705339746,1705339746,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I was originally led to believe that it was just a tech demo. Maybe it was on release: now it's the most amazing car game ever released. In terms of content I don't think that can be argued with. It has five or six maps which dwarf other games' maps by themselves, and a stupid number of(unlicensed) cars once you start counting the different flavours of each model there are. It is customisable to the point of OCD. It's better looking than Assetto Corsa. It has a jaw droppingly cool single player campaign with the kinds of customisation options every racer dreams about. It has missions, challenges, time trials, etc.
The only things missing are proper multiplayer, lobbies, slightly better car-feel to the handling, and...nope, that's it.
